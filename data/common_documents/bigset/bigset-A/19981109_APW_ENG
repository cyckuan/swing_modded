Reports: Falling sculpture in Thai temple kills boy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ In the second such fatal accident in
less than a week, a two-year-old boy was killed when a sculpture at
a Buddhist temple fell on him, local newspapers reported Monday.
	   Vorathon Chaibangyang died on the way to a hospital Sunday after
the 500-kilogram (1,100-pound) sculpture of a bull fell on him at
Thepnimitr temple in Nakorn Pathom Province, 50 kilometers (31
miles) northwest of Bangkok, the Bangkok Post reported.
	   The newspaper quoted police as saying that witnesses claimed
some children had been climbing on the sculpture, causing it to
fall. It said the temple's abbot would be questioned.
	   Last week, five people were killed and more than a dozen injured
when three giant joss sticks collapsed on them at another temple in
Nakorn Pathom.
	   The 27-meter- (88-feet-) high columns, known as the world's
tallest joss sticks, were completed last April at Phra Pathom
temple, famed for its huge dome.
	   The giant joss sticks, each made up of hundreds of thousands of
bundles of regular-size joss, or incense, sticks, fell from their
cement bases an hour before a scheduled ceremony in which they were
to be lit in front of thousands of worshippers.
	   The cause of the accident was not clear.

	   President Rafael Caldera, whose army chief recently implied the
armed forces would seek to block Chavez's rise to power, cast his
ballot Sunday and declared the vote ``an expression of the will of
the people.''
	   In a country where fraud allegations often surround elections,
Caldera promised the results would be ``respected completely and in
a transparent, clean and honest way.''
	   About 11 million of Venezuela's 23 million residents were
eligible to vote and turnout looked strong.
	   The voting was plagued by long lines and confusion over
complicated ballots, however. Voting machines that were being used
for the first time in Venezuela malfunctioned in many balloting
stations.
	   In a front-page plea to its readers, the Caracas newspaper El
Universal tried to calm tensions.
	   ``We call for serenity, balance and strict respect for the
electoral results, as an expression of a sacred social pact,'' it
said.
	   The one presidential candidate who seems to be able to channel
anti-Chavez sentiment is Henrique Salas, a Yale-educated
businessman seen as pro-business and pro-markets.
	   His movement, Proyecto Venezuela, was emerging as the third
largest force in Congress, after Patriotic Pole and Democratic
Action. The initial results showed Proyecto Venezuela with about 12
percent of congressional seats.
	   President Caldera's party, Convergence, which broke away from
Copei five years ago, was not a major player in these elections.
	   The traditional parties had been expected to do better in the
gubernatorial races because many of the candidates are incumbents
who have spent years handing out political favors.
	   Some of the candidates running on Chavez's ticket are former
army officers who participated in his 1992 coup attempt against
then-President Carlos Andres Perez.
	   Perez himself himself was running for senate while under house
arrest in his home state of Tachira pending charges of illegal
enrichment. It wasn't immediately clear if he had won a seat, but
he was expected to do so. A senate seat would give him
parliamentary immunity and allow him to be freed.
	   Many people blame Copei and Democratic Action for the country's
declining living standards and for squandering Venezuela's vast oil
wealth.
	   ``Chavez is the antithesis of the democratic decay this country
has had,'' said Ivan Hernandez, a 52-year-old high school teacher
who said he is voting for Patriotic Pole.

Australia's Downer: One Nation ``peddled bigotry''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Right-wing populist political party
One Nation had shamelessly peddled bigotry by singling out
minorities in Australia as scapegoats for the country's problems,
Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said Monday.
	   ``Bigotry has become the scoundrel's last refuge, and it was
shamelessly peddled by the promoters of One Nation,'' Downer said.
	   One Nation leader Pauline Hanson lost her seat in federal
Parliament in a national election Oct. 3. Despite winning about
eight percent of the national vote, only one One Nation candidate
was elected to Parliament in the poll.
	   Hanson rocketed to prominence after her election in 1996. She
has been accused of racism because of comments, such as that
Australia was in danger of being ``swamped by Asians,'' and her
opposition to Aboriginal welfare.
	   In a speech to open an exhibition which aims to demonstrate how
Aboriginal landowners have worked together with mining companies,
Downer said the rejection of One Nation was one of the great
outcomes of last month's election, at which Prime Minister John
Howard's conservative coalition was re-elected.
	   ``Electors saw through (One Nation's) sleight of hand,'' Downer
said.
	   He said the exhibition _ New Directions, Aboriginal Australia
and Business _ would help fix some of the damage caused by One
Nation to Australia's international reputation.
	   The exhibition, a joint venture between the Department of
Foreign Affairs and Trade and mining giant Rio Tinto, will tour 10
countries, starting next week in the Philippines.

Report: Police to file fraud charges against bank officials
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesian police plan to file banking
fraud charges against the owners and executives of 13 insolvent
banks closed down by the government last November, a report said
Monday.
	   ``We expect the dossiers of the 13 liquidated banks to be
completed in two months' time,'' Col. Made Mangku Pastika said, as
quoted by the Jakarta Post newspaper.
	   Made said the results of the police investigations into two of
the banks would be submitted to prosecutors this week, but he
wouldn't reveal the names of the banks.
	   The 13 banks were among 16 closed by the government last
November for exceeding the legal lending limit. The closures were
the government's first step to clean up the nation's beleaguered
banking industry.
	   Reform of the banking system is seen as crucial to Indonesia's
attempts to recover from its worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   Bank Indonesia asked the police to investigate the bankers in
May, and the authorities began questioning the bank owners in
August.
	   If proven guilty, the bankers will face a maximum sentence of
six years imprisonment or a dlrs 700,000 fine, according to the
report.
	   Among the 16 banks closed were Bank Andromeda, which was owned
by former President Suharto's middle son Bambang Trihatmodjo, and
Bank Jakarta, owned by Suharto's half-brother Probosutedjo.
	   Suharto was forced to end 32 years in power last May after a
wave of riots and protests.

Daewoo to build apartment in New York City
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Daewoo Corp. said Monday it has won a
dlrs 180 million contract to build an apartment building in New
York City.
	   Construction on the 70-story building will begin next year in
Manhattan for the Trump Organization, Daewoo officials said.
	   Due for completion by mid-2001, the complex will have a health
club, restaurant and other convenience facilities, they said.
	   The contract has boosted Daewoo's overseas construction orders
so far this year to dlrs 670 million, compared with dlrs 2.6
billion for the whole of 1997.
	   Daewoo's overseas construction business has been sluggish this
year because of an economic slowdown in its main market in
Southeast Asia.
	   Daewoo Corp. is a trading and construction arm of the Daewoo
group, South Korea's third largest conglomerate.

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ In a major blow to the traditional
parties that have ruled Venezuela for decades, a left-wing
coalition led by failed coup leader Hugo Chavez became the leading
force Sunday in the Venezuelan Congress, initial election results
showed.
	   With 67 percent of the vote counted, Chavez's Patriotic Pole
coalition won 34 percent of the congressional seats, giving it the
single largest share.
	   The center-left Democratic Action Party, one of two traditional
parties that dominate the current Congress, won about 22 percent.
The other one, the conservative Copei Party, won 11 percent.
	   The 44-year-old Chavez, supported by millions of peasants and
shantytown dwellers, is also the front-runner to win the Dec. 6
presidential election. In 1992, he staged an unsuccessful military
revolt against Venezuela's democratically elected government.
	   Many people blame Copei and Democratic Action for the country's
declining living standards and for squandering Venezuela's vast oil
wealth.
	   ``Chavez is the antithesis of the democratic decay this country
has had,'' said Ivan Hernandez, a 52-year-old high school teacher
who voted for Patriotic Pole.
	   Initial results indicated Chavez's Patriotic Pole would pick up
7 of Venezuela's 23 governorships. With about 60 percent of the
vote counted in the gubernatorial races, the Democratic Action
Party and the Copei Party were set to win the governorships in most
of the rest of the country.
	   The remainder of the votes went to a number of smaller parties.
	   Venezuelans were voting for 23 governors, 48 senators, 189
deputies of the lower house of congress and 391 state assembly
members. About 11 million of Venezuela's 23 million residents were
eligible to vote and turnout looked strong.
	   The one presidential candidate who appeared able to tap into
anti-Chavez sentiment was Henrique Salas, a pro-business,
Yale-educated businessman.
	   Even though he did not have much political machinery such as
offices, staff and political patronage to bring out the vote, his
movement, Proyecto Venezuela, was emerging as the third largest
force in Congress, after Patriotic Pole and Democratic Action. The
initial results showed Proyecto Venezuela with about 12 percent of
congressional seats.
	   Some candidates running on Chavez's ticket are former army
officers who participated in his 1992 coup attempt against
then-President Carlos Andres Perez.
	   Perez, who has spent the past several months under house arrest
on charges of illegal enrichment, himself won a senate seat Sunday.
This will give him parliamentary immunity and his freedom.
	   Perez told The Associated Press last week that he will form a
``movement of resistance'' against a possible Chavez
administration.
	   The traditional parties had been expected to dominate the
gubernatorial races. But in a surprise showing, Chavez's father,
Hugo de los Reyes Chavez, was ahead in the race for governor in the
western state of Barinas.
	   The Patriotic Pole's candidate for governor in Zulia state,
incumbent Francisco Arias Cardenas, was also ahead. He was one of
the army officers who participated in Chavez's 1992 coup attempt.
	   ``I am optimistic because the people are alert, with their eyes
wide open,'' said Chavez as he voted Sunday amid shouts of ``Hugo!
Hugo!''
	   With Venezuelan politics taking on overtones of class warfare,
officials dispatched 100,000 soldiers and police to ensure peaceful
voting Sunday and prohibited the sale of liquor and the carrying of
weapons.
	   President Rafael Caldera, whose army chief recently implied the
armed forces would seek to block Chavez's rise to power, cast his
ballot Sunday and declared the vote ``an expression of the will of
the people.''
	   Caldera's party, Convergence, which broke away from Copei five
years ago, was not a major player in these elections.
	   In a country where fraud allegations often surround elections,
Caldera promised the results would be ``respected completely and in
a transparent, clean and honest way.''
	   The voting was plagued by long lines and confusion over

	   The traditional parties had been expected to do better in the

	   The merger between the two Swiss based firms will produce the

Discouraged by lack of progress, talks resume on the next dispute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Discouraged by a series of inconclusive
talks, India and Pakistan move on to another of the problems
souring their relations Monday, a 30-year-old maritime boundary
dispute blocking the development of sea resources.
	   The Sir Creek dispute is the third of six lesser issues on an
agenda headed by territorial dispute over the Himalayan territory
of Kashmir. Two earlier sets of discussions last week in India's
capital made no headway beyond a restatement of positions and an
agreement to keep talking.
	   Despite the lack of progress, the staging of the talks marked an
upturn in relations after a summer of hostile statements. Tension
began to rise after India's new Hindu nationalist government
detonated a nuclear devices in May, prompting a matching test in
Pakistan, and raising international concern over the threat of
nuclear war over Kashmir.
	   India hopes resolving some of the minor issues will create a
more cooperative atmosphere for settling the Kashmir dispute, but
Pakistan says Kashmir should be dealt with first. The 50-year-old
claims to Kashmir were discussed last month in Islamabad with few
results.
	   On Monday, senior bureaucrats met at the British-built sandstone
Foreign Ministry to take up the demarcation of the border between
the Indian state of Gujarat and Pakistan's Sind province, which
follows the shifting tidal channel known as Sir Creek.
	   The dispute led to armed clashes in 1965, and was left
unresolved three years later when an international tribunal set
other boundaries in the sparsely populated desert area.
	   Failure to fix the border at the mouth of Sir Creek has blocked
agreement on the maritime boundary in the Arabian Sea, preventing
the exploration of what could be rich offshore deposits of oil and
gas. Each country also routinely arrests fishermen from the other
country intruding into the disputed zone.
	   On Friday, the Indian and Pakistani defense secretaries failed
to agree on a truce on the Siachen Glacier, a 20,000-foot-high
(6,000 meter) battlefield. Artillery duels and small arms clashes
killed more than a dozen soldiers in the previous two weeks on the
ice sheet that forms Kashmir's northern sector.
	   Rejecting India's proposal for an immediate cease-fire, Pakistan
said the truce would be pointless unless the troops disengage and
withdraw to new positions. Although fighting intensified over the
last few weeks, far more soldiers die every year from exposure and
ailments related to the high altitude than from enemy fire.
	   Also discussed last week was a dispute over regulating the
waters of the Jhelum River that flows through both the Indian and
Pakistani sides of Kashmir, which was divided in the first of three
Indo-Pakistan wars in 1947.

Japan might derail plans for faster free trade, Australia warns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Japan would set a bad example for
Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand if it presses its case for a
reversal of previously agreed goals for accelerated progress
towards free trade, Australian officials warned Monday.
	   The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum is aiming for free
trade between developed countries in the organization by 2010 and
full free trade in the region, including developing countries, by
2020.
	   Members have also agreed to fast track progress towards free
trade in chemicals, energy, fishing, forestry products, gems and
jewelry, medical equipment and instruments and to establish mutual
recognition arrangements in telecommunications and toys.
	   But Japan now wants forestry and fisheries exempted, and has
balked at speeding up the reduction of its trade barriers in those
industries, the sectors it sees as most vulnerable to foreign
competition.
	   Australian officials, speaking at a formal briefing before next
week's APEC forum leaders' meeting, said they would be disappointed
if Japan persists with this argument.
	   Indonesia, Thailand and South Korea have concerns similar to
Japan's, and could be influenced by Japan's position, the officials
said, on condition of anonymity.
	   ``It is a real concern,'' said one official. ``It is quite clear
from our conversations that they (Thailand, Indonesia and South
Korea) have some sensitivities in precisely those sectors as well
at the domestic level.
	   ``I mean the Korean government has been making an enormous
amount of change in the way it administers its own economy. It is
just very much easier to go forward with change if you are doing it
in concert with your neighbors.''
	   Leaders from 20 Pacific rim countries and Hong Kong, including
U.S. President Bill Clinton, will attend the APEC forum meetings in
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on Nov. 17-18.
	   The United States, Australia and New Zealand have indicated they
will urge APEC leaders not to retreat from the forum's broad or
detailed free trade goals.
	   APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua
New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the
United States. Russia, Vietnam and Peru will join at the Kuala
Lumpur summit.

Leader of first Everest conquest dies

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with reaction from expedition member Hillary in graf
10-11 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ John Hunt, leader of the British expedition which
first climbed Mount Everest, has died at age 88.
	   Hunt died at his home in Henley-on-Thames Saturday night, said
his daughter, Sally Nesbitt. The family's announcement on Sunday
said only that Hunt died following a brief illness.
	   As leader of the expedition in 1953, Hunt decided it was his
responsibility to remain at base camp while Edmund Hillary and
Tenzing Norgay climbed the last 400 feet (120 m) to the summit.
	   Hunt recalled that he wept for joy when he heard Hillary's boast
_ ``Well, we knocked the bastard off!'' _ as he returned from the
summit on May 29. Hunt said it was the greatest moment of his life,
even though there was a sense of personal disappointment.
	   ``It was my ambition just as much as everybody else's in the
party to be first at the top,'' he said in an interview with the
Evening News in 1978.
	   ``I thought about it a lot and concluded that it was important
for the leader to be in a position where he could exercise some
control if necessary. It did not seem that I could do both.''
	   In fact, Hunt and two other members of the team made the first
attempt on the south col, but stopped 400 feet (120 m) short of the
summit. They left their equipment and supplies for Hillary and
Tenzing to make the second attempt.
	   Had they failed, Hunt said he was prepared to lead a third
assault on the peak.
	   ``He was a great team leader and he was able to bring people in,
myself and Hillary both being New Zealanders, and make us all feel
bound together,'' said expedition member George Lowe. ``What he
achieved with us on Everest was that he had a group of prima donnas
who all wanted to be the first to the top and he made us a team.''
	   Hillary praised Lord Hunt's leadership.
	   He ''was a very nice person, an extremely competent leader,
especially on our Everest expedition, and he had a very delightful
personality,'' Hillary said. ''He was really a very nice person
indeed.''
	   Hunt harbored mystical feelings about mountains, especially
Everest. After his first daughter was born in 1936 in the Indian
city of Darjeeling, hunt set off on a brisk walk in the early hours
of the morning. He reached a hilltop about 10 miles (15 kms) away
in time to see Everest looming above the mist in the dawn light.
	   ``It was an expression of joy, I suppose,'' he said in an
interview with The Guardian in 1978. '' ... There was only one
thing to do. One could almost say one was giving thanks.''
	   ``The Ascent of Everest,'' the book Hunt published shortly after
the expedition, reflected his belief that it would be wrong to
boast of ``conquest.''
	   ``The relationship between a man and what he does on a mountain
is one of humility,'' Hunt said in an interview with The Guardian
in 1978.
	   ``They make you feel small, mountains, which is a salutary
feeling. And therefore, to feel that you've conquered them is a
presumption.''
	   Hunt was a colonel in the British Army when he was tapped to
lead the Everest expedition. He later felt that his
mountain-climbing fame thwarted his ambitions of reaching the
highest ranks of the army, and he retired in 1956 to become the
first director of the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme promoted by
Prince Philip.
	   He was knighted in 1953 and elevated in 1966 to the House of
Lords, where he took the tittle of Baron Hunt of Llanfairwaterdine.
He was a personal adviser to Prime Minister Harold Wilson during
the Nigerian civil war in the late 1960s and directed British
relief missions to that country.
	   Buckingham Palace said Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip were
``very sad'' to learn of Hunt's death.
	   ``The conquest of Everest was an early landmark of the queen's
reign and Lord Hunt brought the same spirit of adventure and
leadership to many other areas of national life,'' the palace's
statement said.
	   Hunt is survived by his wife Joy, whom he married in 1936, and
their four daughters. Funeral arrangements were not announced.

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Ciba Speciality Chemicals AG and
Clariant announced Monday they would merge to form a chemicals
giant with a yearly turnover of 18 billion Swiss francs (dlrs 13
billion).
	   The merger between the two Swiss based firms will produce the
world's biggest company making speciality chemicals and dyes.
	   Some 3,000 jobs of the total 55,000 worldwide will be lost in
the process. It is hoped to save about 600 million francs (dlrs 444
million) per year through rationalization, a statement said.
	   The merger will take the form of a share swap. Ciba shareholders
will receive 46 percent of the shares and Clariant shareholders 54
percent.
	   The new company will be called Clariant. Its logo will be the
butterfly which was Ciba's trademark.
	   Ciba Speciality Chemicals was a spinoff from Ciba Geigy.
Clariant used to be part of Sandoz until it was separated out in
1995. The two former parent companies merged in 1996 to form the
drug group Novartis.
	   The new company president will be Rolf Schweizer, current
Clariant president. Vice President and Chief Executive Officer will
be Rolf Meyer, the Ciba Speciality Chemicals President.
	   The announcement said that Germany's Hoechst would retain its 45
percent stake in Clariant until completion of the merger. This
would then be reduced proportionately.
	   The merger is subject to approval from regulatory authorities.

Clinton urges Cambodian leaders to resume dialogue
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton urged
Cambodian political leaders Monday to resume stalled negotiations
to try to solve election-related disputes and form a new
government.
	   ``It is imperative that Cambodia's leaders participate in
peaceful dialogue leading toward a resolution of outstanding
election issues and formation of a government,'' Clinton said in a
message addressed to King Norodom Sihanouk on the occasion of
Cambodian Independence Day.
	   Clinton's message, released by the Royal Palace, praised the
role King Sihanouk has played in trying to bring about
reconciliation in his country.
	   The 76-year-old monarch is considered by many people to be the
best hope for brokering an end to the political deadlock triggered
by July's parliamentary elections.
	   The ruling Cambodian People's Party of Co-Premier Hun Sen won 64
of the 122 seats in the national assembly, but failed to capture
the two-thirds majority needed to form a new government.
	   Opposition parties led by Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam
Rainsy, holding the remainder of the seats, claimed that Hun Sen's
victory was achieved through fraud and intimidation.
	   The opposition leaders have so far refused to cooperate with Hun
Sen in forming a new government. Both left the country right after
the Sept. 24 convening of the new national assembly due to fear of
political persecution and arrest.
	   Talks between government and opposition representatives failed
to break the stalemate.
	   In his message to King Sihanouk, Clinton suggested that dialogue
be resumed between political leaders in order to form a new
government which ``reflects the will of the people as expressed in
the July elections.''
	   The president assured Sihanouk that the United States will
continue to work with the monarch ``to ensure that the future
brings true democracy and a lasting peace to Cambodia.''
	   Sihanouk recently offered royal protection to Prince Ranariddh _
his son _ and former finance minister Sam Rainsy if they return to
Cambodia within one week.
	   He has also indicated that he could host a political summit
before Nov. 14, when he will have to go to China for a medical
checkup and treatment for numerous ailments.
	   The king, who led his country to independence, held a ceremony
Monday marking the 45th anniversary of the occasion. Cambodia had
been a French colony for nearly a century before it attained
self-rule in 1953.

Philippines: Chinese workers building barracks on disputed reef
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ More than 100 Chinese workers are
building large concrete barracks and possibly a pier on a disputed
South China Sea reef, Philippine Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado
said Monday.
	   He called the Chinese buildup on Mischief Reef a ``creeping
invasion'' of Philippine territorial waters and said Manila is
considering filing a complaint at the United Nations.
	   The reef, which the Philippines calls Panganiban, is located in
the disputed Spratly Islands.
	   In a closed-door briefing for Philippine senators on the Chinese
actions, Mercado said he showed photographs taken from air force
reconnaissance planes revealing new concrete structures in what had
been a cluster of small huts on stilts on the reef.
	   Last week, the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs summoned
the Chinese ambassador and delivered a diplomatic note protesting
the presence of gun-bearing Chinese ships and construction
activities on the reef, located 345 kilometers (215 miles) west of
the Philippine island of Palawan.
	   Philippine officials demanded that China stop the buildup and
dismantle all structures on the reef.
	   President Joseph Estrada plans to take up the issue with Chinese
President Jiang Zemin on the sidelines of a meeting of Asia-Pacific
leaders later this month in Malaysia.
	   Chinese officials say they are just repairing fishing shelters
damaged by natural causes. China said it has a sovereign right to
undertake the repairs for the safety of its fishermen.
	   Mercado, however, rejected China's explanation. ``The Chinese
are not conducting repair and renovation works. There is frenetic,
massive construction going on and they are putting up barracks.''
	   ``We believe there are cement structures that will be the
precursor of a possible pier,'' he said.
	   A Philippine military official based on Palawan said they also
have sighted a wide platform that could be turned into a helicopter
landing pad. He said Chinese frigates and ships, carrying
construction materials, have frequented the area in recent weeks.
	   Mercado said China's actions on the reef violated the United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Seas, which gives countries
the exclusive right to exploit resources in the sea 200 miles from
their shores.
	   Tensions over Mischief Reef first flared in 1995 when the
Philippines spotted concrete structures built by China. Disputes
over the reef and other areas in the Spratlys have since
periodically upset relations.
	   The Spratlys are believed to lie atop valuable mineral and gas
deposits. But claims over all or part of the chain by six
governments _ China, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and
Vietnam _ have prevented thorough exploration.

Local Mexican elections viewed as test of major party strength

 &UR; Eds: NEW details throughout and UPDATES with PAN state chairman
pledging to annul Sinaloa election for alleged irregularities.
 &UR; By ADOLFO GARZA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico's ruling party appeared headed for a
strong victory in state elections, with early results and exit
polls showing it far ahead in two governor's races and running even
in a third.
	   The Institutional Revolutionary Party, the longest-ruling party
in the Western hemisphere, was winning with 54 percent of the vote
in Puebla state to 33 percent for the conservative National Action
Party, according to exit polls by two television networks on
Sunday.
	   In northwestern state of Sinaloa, with 15 percent of the vote
counted, the ruling party won 46 percent to 34 percent for the
Action Party.
	   But Action Party chairman Rafael Morgan Rios said he would seek
to annul the election in Sinaloa because of alleged irregularities.
``We do not accept defeat,'' he said late Sunday.
	   The PRI already has won five of seven gubernatorial elections
this year, and Sunday's elections may help it gather momentum
toward presidential elections in 2000.
	   ``The triumphs obtained today by the PRI are a source of
encouragement,'' party chairman Mariano Palacios Alcocer party.
	   The left-center Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, appeared to
have a chance of gaining a second governorship in the small central
state of Tlaxcala, exit polls showed.
	   Complete official results weren't expected until Monday.
	   Voting was mostly problem-free in the four states, although
attempted vote-buying was reported in Sinaloa. Witnesses said PRI
and National Action activists offered money to those who would vote
for their candidates.
	   National Action leaders in Puebla accused pro-PRI taxi drivers
of offering transportation to supporters of the ruling party.
	   After the 1997 midterm elections, when the PRI lost control of
the lower house of Congress and of Mexico City, the party's future
had been in question. Its move toward selecting candidates through
open primaries is believed to have helped the PRI recover
disillusioned voters.
	   ``There were doubts early in the year about the PRI's ability to
win elections. Now it is adapting to a more competitive elections
system in Mexico,'' said Armand Peschard, an analyst with the
Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
	   Sinaloa state is plagued by drug-trafficking and high
unemployment that has forced many residents to move _ some to the
United States _ in search of jobs.
	   The PRI hopes internal reforms like the primary used to choose
candidate Juan S. Millan, a former labor leader, will keep
Sinaloa's 1.44 million voters loyal to the party. Prior to this
year, the PRI chose such candidates in back-room deals. Millan has
built his campaign on stronger anti-drug efforts.
	   Many of the leaders of Mexico's largest drug cartels were born
or lived in Sinaloa, including deceased drug lord Amado Carrillo
Fuentes and the Arellano Felix brothers, now reputedly the
country's top traffickers.
	   ``To guarantee jobs, investment, and education, we must change
the state's image as soon as possible. There's no other way. We
can't allow for the name of Sinaloa to be immediately associated
with drug trafficking,'' Millan said.
	   The political fortunes of three men widely seen as potential
presidential candidates in 2000 could be affected by the results of
the state races.
	   Old guard Gov. Manuel Bartlett will likely see his presidential
prospects boosted by the PRI victory in Puebla, whose governorship
he will be leaving after the elections.
	   Interior Minister Francisco Labastida, also of PRI, will be
helped by a ruling-party victory in his home state of Sinaloa.
	   And Mexico City Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who has already run
for president two times, would get a boost from PRD victories in
Tlaxcala or Michoacan, a state he once governed.

Taliban leader says religious police have imposed Islamic order
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AMIR SHAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Bemoaning Afghanistan's past when
women were seen in Kabul without the all-enveloping burqua, working
in offices and attending school, the Taliban's religious police
minister on Monday described how his ministry spent two years
imposing Islamic order.
	   In a Radio Shariat broadcast Maulvi Qalamuddin said his
religious police have closed bath houses for women, beauty salons
and ``those special places where brides would go to have their
makeup and hair done.''
	   Before the Taliban women worked in offices and many attended
private schools, where they learned subjects other than the Koran,
but Qalamuddin said his religious police put an end to that.
	   ``It was against Islam,'' he said. ``Women were working in
foreign organizations, but we stopped that.''
	   The Taliban took control of Kabul in September 1996 throwing out
President Burhanuddin Rabbani and his military chief Ahmed Shah
Massood, who ruled after the pro-communist government fell four
year earlier.
	   Rabbani was considered an orthodox Muslim who ordered women to
wear head scarves. However, he maintained schools for girls and
allowed women to work.
	   Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who was sworn in as Afghanistan's prime
minister toward the end of Rabbani's rule, was considered more
radical. He was reported to have thrown acid on women who wore
skirts. He also tried to close Kabul's only cinema and favored the
all-enveloping burqua for women.
	   Once in Kabul the Taliban moved quickly said Qalamuddin,
ordering women off the job and closing schools for girls.
	   A woman seen without the all-enveloping burqua was publicly
beaten, often with a steel radio antennae ripped off the nearest
car by the Taliban policeman.
	   In his broadcast extolling the work of his ministry over the
past two years, Qalamuddin accused Christian missionaries of
proselytizing under the guise of humanitarian aid workers. He said
Christian churches had sprung up in the capital and the Taliban
confiscated ``hundreds of bibles'' translated in to the local Dari
and Pashtu languages.
	   ``These Christians have come to Kabul to teach our Muslims about
Christianity. . . We stopped that,'' he said.
	   International aid organizations left the beleaguered capital
last July after the Taliban army ordered them to relocate to
war-damaged dormitories. They refused and the Taliban ordered them
to leave.
	   After their departure several Taliban officials said Christian
organizations among the aid workers were proselytizing, a charge
that has never been proven, nor have any arrests been made.
	   Qalamuddin said the Taliban's ban on shaving has been enforced
by jailing and beating offenders.
	   ``Now people are following our rules,'' he said.
	   The Taliban rule in 90 percent of Afghanistan where they have
imposed their strict brand of Islamic rule. Rabbani and his
anti-Taliban alliance rule in the remaining 10 percent.

Court: Hong Kong civil servants need fluent Chinese
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Foreigners working for Hong Kong's civil
service must be proficient in Chinese if they want to be classified
as permanent employees, a court ruled Monday.
	   Hong Kong instituted the Chinese-language requirement in
November 1997, less than four months after the territory was handed
over to China from Britain.
	   The Association of Expatriate Civil Servants, representing
mainly British people who still work for the Hong Kong government,
complained that the rule violates its members' civil rights,
government-run Radio Hong Kong reported.
	   The association argued that the requirement contravened the
Basic Law, Hong Kong's constitution since it returned to Chinese
rule, and the bill of rights.
	   But the radio report said that a court threw out the claim,
arguing that while the association's concerns about the language
requirement were understandable, the government had acted lawfully.

Leader of first Everest conquest dies

 &UR; EDS: RETRANSMITTING to drop slug of 2nd Ld-Writethru to conform to
style; RECAPS with reaction from expedition member Hillary in graf
10-11 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ John Hunt, leader of the British expedition which
first climbed Mount Everest, has died at age 88.
	   Hunt died at his home in Henley-on-Thames Saturday night, said
his daughter, Sally Nesbitt. The family's announcement on Sunday
said only that Hunt died following a brief illness.
	   As leader of the expedition in 1953, Hunt decided it was his
responsibility to remain at base camp while Edmund Hillary and
Tenzing Norgay climbed the last 400 feet (120 m) to the summit.
	   Hunt recalled that he wept for joy when he heard Hillary's boast
_ ``Well, we knocked the bastard off!'' _ as he returned from the
summit on May 29. Hunt said it was the greatest moment of his life,
even though there was a sense of personal disappointment.
	   ``It was my ambition just as much as everybody else's in the
party to be first at the top,'' he said in an interview with the
Evening News in 1978.
	   ``I thought about it a lot and concluded that it was important
for the leader to be in a position where he could exercise some
control if necessary. It did not seem that I could do both.''
	   In fact, Hunt and two other members of the team made the first
attempt on the south col, but stopped 400 feet (120 m) short of the
summit. They left their equipment and supplies for Hillary and
Tenzing to make the second attempt.
	   Had they failed, Hunt said he was prepared to lead a third
assault on the peak.
	   ``He was a great team leader and he was able to bring people in,
myself and Hillary both being New Zealanders, and make us all feel
bound together,'' said expedition member George Lowe. ``What he
achieved with us on Everest was that he had a group of prima donnas
who all wanted to be the first to the top and he made us a team.''
	   Hillary praised Lord Hunt's leadership.
	   He ``was a very nice person, an extremely competent leader,
especially on our Everest expedition, and he had a very delightful
personality,'' Hillary said. ``He was really a very nice person
indeed.''
	   Hunt harbored mystical feelings about mountains, especially
Everest. After his first daughter was born in 1936 in the Indian
city of Darjeeling, hunt set off on a brisk walk in the early hours
of the morning. He reached a hilltop about 10 miles (15 kms) away
in time to see Everest looming above the mist in the dawn light.
	   ``It was an expression of joy, I suppose,'' he said in an
interview with The Guardian in 1978. '' ... There was only one
thing to do. One could almost say one was giving thanks.''
	   ``The Ascent of Everest,'' the book Hunt published shortly after
the expedition, reflected his belief that it would be wrong to
boast of ``conquest.''
	   ``The relationship between a man and what he does on a mountain
is one of humility,'' Hunt said in an interview with The Guardian
in 1978.
	   ``They make you feel small, mountains, which is a salutary
feeling. And therefore, to feel that you've conquered them is a
presumption.''
	   Hunt was a colonel in the British Army when he was tapped to
lead the Everest expedition. He later felt that his
mountain-climbing fame thwarted his ambitions of reaching the
highest ranks of the army, and he retired in 1956 to become the
first director of the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme promoted by
Prince Philip.
	   He was knighted in 1953 and elevated in 1966 to the House of
Lords, where he took the tittle of Baron Hunt of Llanfairwaterdine.
He was a personal adviser to Prime Minister Harold Wilson during
the Nigerian civil war in the late 1960s and directed British
relief missions to that country.
	   Buckingham Palace said Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip were
``very sad'' to learn of Hunt's death.
	   ``The conquest of Everest was an early landmark of the queen's
reign and Lord Hunt brought the same spirit of adventure and
leadership to many other areas of national life,'' the palace's
statement said.
	   Hunt is survived by his wife Joy, whom he married in 1936, and
their four daughters. Funeral arrangements were not announced.

Dollar higher, Japanese stocks close mixed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stocks, mid-afternoon dollar, bond &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was higher against the yen at
mid-afternoon Monday on concerns the United States may attack Iraq.
Japanese stocks finished mixed.
	   The dollar bought 119.54 yen at midafternoon, up 1.54 yen from
late Friday in Tokyo and also above its New York level of 119.10
yen Friday.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 70.83
points, or 0.51 percent, to 14,194.54 points. On Friday, the
average closed down 218.40 points, or 1.53 percent.
	   Traders said the dollar gained early in the day amid speculation
the United States may use force to try to reopen Iraqi weapons
sites to U.N. Inspectors. The U.S. currency, considered a financial
safe haven, often strengthens in times of crisis.
	   On Sunday, President Bill Clinton directed his senior advisers
to weigh military and diplomatic strategies for a few more days.
Iraqi ministers said they would not back away from their decision
to bar U.N. inspections unless crippling economic sanctions were
lifted.
	   Fifteen U.N. weapons inspectors left Baghdad Saturday as the
United Nations began to reduce its presence in Iraq.
	   Traders were also awaiting possible remarks by Japanese
officials regarding the outline of a ruling Liberal Democratic
Party economic stimulus package expected later this week.
	   Share prices started higher Monday on hopes for more stimulus
measures, fueled by a Kyodo News agency report that Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi pledged in talks with former Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone on Saturday that he would study a proposal to cut the
consumption tax to 3 percent from the current 5 percent.
	   The April 1997 consumption tax increase is considered one of the
major causes of Japan's recession.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 5.31 points, or 0.49 percent, to 1,084.16
points. The TOPIX closed down 15.10 points, or 1.37 percent, on
Friday.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond slipped to 0.825 percent from Friday's finish of 0.835
percent, driving its price up to 109.67 yen, up from 108.58 yen.

Government troops scatter remaining rebel fighters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ Government troops chased the last
large group of rebel fighters into the mountains on Monday after
five days of fighting in the Central Asian nation.
	   The 200 rebels concentrated around the town of Aini, about 160
kilometers (100 miles) north of the capital Dushanbe, tried to flee
in small groups toward the border of Uzbekistan after suffering
heavy losses in weekend firefights with government soldiers, who
had surrounded them.
	   Forty rebels were killed and 10 government soldiers wounded in
the fighting, Tajikistan presidential spokesman Zafar Saidov said
Sunday evening.
	   Government officials say the rebels would not escape because the
area is surrounded and all roads have been cut off, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported.
	   Though some of the rebels have been captured, the whereabouts of
their leader, former army Col. Makhmud Khudoberdyev, were unknown,
ITAR-Tass said.
	   Khudoberdyev began the uprising in northern regions of
Tajikistan on Wednesday, demanding that President Emomali Rakhmonov
free all political prisoners and bring his supporters into the
government. The president has ruled out any talks with the rebels.
	   The fighting follows a peace treaty last year that ended five
years of civil war between the Muslim opposition and Rakhmonov's
hardline government. Main opposition groups are now participating
in the government and the armed forces.
	   Still, there are many rebel leaders and warlords who ignore the
accords and frequently wage small-scale attacks across the poor,
mountainous former Soviet republic.

Malaysia to fund budget deficit with pension money
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
said Monday the country's mandatory pension fund would be the main
source of funds to cover the 1999 budget deficit, the national news
agency Bernama reported.
	   Reading Mahathir's comments in Parliament, junior finance
minister Mustapa Mohamed said two-thirds of the projected 16.64
billion ringgit (dlrs 4.3 billion) budget deficit would come from
domestic sources and the balance from external sources.
	   The deficit is about 6 percent of gross national product.
	   ``The Employees Provident Fund, which can collect 1 billion
ringgit (dlrs 263 million) in monthly contributions, has been
identified as the main internal source,'' Mahathir, who is also
finance minister, was quoted as saying.
	   The EPF, meant for retiring employees, has assets totaling about
130 billion ringgit (dlrs 34 billion). EPF funds have also been
used to support troubled companies deemed important by the
government.
	   Jettisoning an austerity policy, Malaysia last month unveiled a
budget expanding government spending, which is Mahathir's formula
for pulling out of recession.
	   Thirty-six road projects worth 2.79 billion ringgit (dlrs
734,000) had been approved to help the economy, Works Ministry
Parliamentary Secretary Yong Khoon Seng said Monday in Parliament.
	   Malaysia tried to borrow money overseas, but it was forced to
abandon a planned dlrs 2 billion sovereign issue in August after
ratings agencies Moody's Investors Service and Standard and Poor's
downgraded the country's creditworthiness, preferring not to set an
expensive precedent.
	   The country's ratings were again cut to within a hair's breadth
of junk status after capital controls were imposed Sept. 1.

June 1999 deadline set for Laotian asylum-seekers to leave
</HEADLINE>
Thailand &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Acting on a Thai government proposal,
the United Nations will re-screen the remaining 1,350
asylum-seekers from Laos living in Thailand and try to repatriate
those not deemed legitimate refugees, the Thai Foreign Ministry
spokesman said Monday.
	   The governments of Thailand and Laos, together with the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, have set June 1999 as the
target date to return any displaced person who failed to qualify as
a refugee, spokesman Kobsak Chutikul said.
	   The three parties reached agreement on the plan Sunday in
Bangkok, he said.
	   Under international law, a person claiming refugee status must
be able to prove that he faces political persecution in his
homeland.
	   Kobsak cautioned that the target date is mainly for planning
purposes and there is no guarantee that everyone would be
repatriated by then.
	   The repatriation program faces budget constraints, he added.
	   Thailand has the sovereign right to deport people who are not
legitimate refugees, but it is standard international practice to
allow them to be voluntarily repatriated, Kobsak said.
	   Almost 360,000 refugees and asylum-seekers fled to Thailand
after the Communist takeover of Laos in 1975. Some 324,000 were
resettled in third countries, including 200,000 who went to the
United States.
	   Since 1980, more than 20,000 of those who fled have voluntarily
returned to their homeland.

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ In a desperate race against time,
relief agencies trying to feed tens of thousands isolated by
Hurricane Mitch struggled to deliver tons of food, despite ruptured
roads, backed-up airports and too few helicopters.
	   Hunger and disease threaten to raise the death toll from Mitch,
which Central American officials estimate has killed more than
10,000 in the region. If confirmed, that would make Mitch among the
five worst hurricanes ever recorded in the Caribbean.
	   ``The Honduran Red Cross is giving out all they have. Everything
incoming is absolutely necessary,'' American Red Cross spokeswoman
Ann Stingle said on Sunday.
	   On Sunday, the first shipments of aid reached many hamlets and
cities cut off by flooding, such as Choluteca in southern Honduras
and Posoltega, Nicaragua, where an estimated 2,000 people were
killed in a mudslide.
	   But some were kept waiting.
	   ``We heard on the radio that aid is coming, but we're still
eating rice,'' said Ann Soto, 19, at a refugee shelter in
Posoltega.
	   Former President George Bush was in Tegucigalpa, the Honduran
capital, as more than 60,000 pounds of aid from the U.S. relief
group Americares arrived Sunday. He said much more would be needed
for months _ maybe years _ to come.
	   ``I can tell the American people and the people of the world
that the devastation is appalling,'' Bush said after viewing damage
with Honduran President Carlos Flores.
	   Central American presidents were traveling to El Salvador on
Monday to discuss how to handle the regional disaster.
	   The leaders of Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador and
Costa Rica were expected to appeal to financial organizations to
forgive their foreign debts so they can focus on recovery.
	   They also planned to urge the United States to keep postponing
deportations of illegal immigrants, Salvadoran Foreign Minister
Ramon Gonzalez said Sunday.
	   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service temporarily
suspended deportations of immigrants to Honduras and Guatemala as a
``humanitarian gesture'' until Tuesday.
	   In Tegucigalpa, Bush and Flores said without sustained aid,
Central Americans struggling to survive could migrate north to the
United States. ``If people feel there is no hope for their families
they will go elsewhere. They will go north, if necessary,'' Flores
said.
	   In Honduras alone, 700,000 people will need food for the next
month, U.N. World Food Program representative Giuseppi Lubatti
estimated.
	   Honduran, U.S., Mexican and other authorities struggled to
overcome logistical problems in getting aid to remote areas. On
Sunday, a Mexican C-130 cargo plane blew a tire while landing in
Tegucigalpa, disrupting flights for several hours.
	   ``It's taken us a little time to get synchronized. Hopefully,
this will get a little better,'' said U.S. Army Lt. Col. Mike
Morales.
	   The first members of a Canadian military team specializing in
disaster relief were scheduled to leave on Monday for northern
Honduras, where they will establish an air traffic control system.
	   U.S. military engineers were sent to help repair roads and
bridges. U.S. forces also will help transport pipes into
Tegucigalpa to repair the water network, now running at 25 percent
capacity.
	   In Nicaragua, aid distribution has become highly politicized.
	   Victims have accused President Arnoldo Aleman of being slow to
help some of the worst-hit regions because inhabitants
overwhelmingly support leftist Sandinistas, the former rebels who
governed through the 1980s.
	   ``The government has shown a lack of competence and a lack of
responsibility,'' said former President Daniel Ortega, whose
Sandinista supporters drove dozens of truckloads of aid into
Posoltega on Sunday.
	   The military continued to dispose of hundreds of bodies of
people killed in the massive mudslides in northwestern Nicaragua.
Lt. Col. Juan Molinares, the army commander in charge of the
Posoltega region, said soldiers had burned or buried 538 corpses.
	   Mexican search teams continued to look for victims in river
banks and debris piles in Tegucigalpa.
	   Assisting a beleaguered Honduran Red Cross, the American Red
Cross was sending 40 tons of water purification chemicals and
antibiotics to stem the spread of disease.
	   ``We have nothing to drink,'' Argentina Giron, 30, said at a
Tegucigalpa shelter.

China's industrial output rebounds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's value-added industrial production rose
10.6 percent in October from a year earlier, showing signs of
revival from lagging growth earlier in the year, the government
announced Monday.
	   The figure was 0.4 percentage points higher than September's
growth rate, the State Statistical Bureau reported.
	   The value-added, or incremental value, of industrial production
excludes the cost of raw materials used in the manufacturing
process. It is China's benchmark measure of industrial production.
	   Value-added industrial output for January to October rose 8.2
percent from the year-earlier period to 1.62 trillion yuan (dlrs
195.88 billion), an increase of 0.2 percentage points over the
January-September growth rate, the bureau said.
	   The government's push for increased infrastructure construction
boosted output at heavy industry companies during the period, the
report said. Heavy industry output rose 10.3 percent in October
from a year earlier, 0.7 percentage points higher than in
September.
	   With the government ordering banks to step up lending to help
stimulate the economy, production at state companies has risen.
Industrial output by state-owned and state-controlled companies
rose 6 percent in October from last year, the report said.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - In a massive show of force, thousands
of police and soldiers patrolled Jakarta Monday ahead of a
government assembly that has drawn the ire of student protesters.
	   Parliament resembled an armed camp, with officers in riot gear
deployed on the grounds to safeguard the assembly that will cast
rules for 1999 parliamentary elections. Troops rolled out barbed
wire barricades in front of some gates.
	   Violence flared on one university campus near Parliament, where
government-backed civilian guards in trucks briefly hurled rocks
and plastic bottles at students, witnesses said. Police did not
intervene.
	   Students also scuffled with police at a courthouse, and
white-collar workers rallied at the stock exchange in protests
against the People's Consultative Assembly and its patron,
President B.J. Habibie. The four-day convention opens Tuesday.
	   Many student activists reject the 1,000-member assembly as a
haven for cronies of former President Suharto, who quit in May
after riots and protests against his 32-year authoritarian rule.
	   Habibie, a onetime confidant of Suharto who has tried to
distance himself from the former leader, has promised the assembly
will be ``a milestone'' on the road to democracy.
	   He wants parliamentary elections to be held next May, followed
by the selection of a new head of state by a newly designed
assembly at the end of 1999.
	   Habibie, a German-trained engineer, has undone many of the rigid
controls that characterized Indonesian political life under the
77-year-old Suharto. He has freed some political prisoners and
allowed political parties and trade unions to form. The media are
freer.
	   But Indonesia's political climate is so fragile that the
military has deployed 30,000 police and soldiers in the capital to
clamp down on any unruly protesters.
	   Seventy student protesters who gathered outside the Supreme
Court Monday demanded that Habibie step down, accusing him of
maneuvering to stay in power. Police with sticks pushed them back
and one protester was injured.
	   Sixty office workers, many of them wearing neckties,
demonstrated against the government assembly outside the gleaming
office towers that house the stock exchange.
	   They demanded that the military drop its prominent role in
politics. The military, a bastion of support for Suharto, currently
has 75 seats allotted to it in the 500-member Parliament.
	   ``We pay tax but the government uses it'' to bankroll the
military, said Brimi, a protester.
	   ``We need political certainty,'' read a banner at the rally.
	   The convening of the assembly comes as the world's fourth most
populous nation grapples with its worst economic crisis in decades.
	   Inflation and unemployment are high, and millions of people are
sinking into poverty. Rioting and looting over price rises have
occurred sporadically since May in many areas.
	   There has been some positive economic news in recent weeks, with
the fragile currency recovering some of its value and interest
rates declining.
	   However, fears of unrest at the assembly this week have undercut
some of the rupiah's recent gains and many foreign businesses
remain reluctant to invest in Indonesia because of the political
uncertainty.

England takes lead over South Australia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ England battled to an 11-run lead
over South Australia with six second-innings wickets remaining at
stumps Monday on the third day of a four-day cricket match at the
Adelaide Oval.
	   England was 149-4 with lefthander Graham Thorpe on 30 and Mark
Ramprakash not out 33. It started its second innings 138 runs
behind after bowling South Australia out for 325 earlier Monday.
	   Misfortune dogged England's batsmen when the visitors lost three
wickets for eight runs midway through the final session.
	   In-form strokeplayer Nasser Hussain was trapped lbw by a Mark
Harrity delivery that kept low, captain Alec Stewart completed a
pair of ducks when adjudged lbw after not offering a shot and
opener Michael Atherton was run out when gaining momentum.
	   Atherton, on 53, was at the non-striker's end when a crashing
Thorpe drive flicked a fingertip of paceman Harrity and deflected
onto the stumps, with the experienced opener just short of his
crease.
	   Earlier, England fast bowler Dominic Cork claimed 4-45 from an
impressive 29 overs and seamer Angus Fraser snared 3-57 from 27
overs as the tourists restricted the state side's lead on the first
innings.
	   South Australian middle order batsman Jeff Vaughan completed a
half-century Monday before being dismissed by Fraser for 58.
	   The first of five Ashes tests between Australia and England
begins on Nov. 20 in Brisbane. (djp)

Chinese workers surround government office to protest sell-off
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Workers from a state-run cement factory
surrounded government offices in central China for five days to
protest a plan to privatize their plant, a rights group reported
Monday.
	   All 600 workers at the Luoyang Cement Products Factory fear a
cheap sale of both state assets and their future, the New
York-based Human Rights in China reported.
	   About 200 workers besieged city government offices in Luoyang,
in Henan province, from Monday to Friday last week demanding that
approval of the sale to a private company be reversed, the group
said.
	   Confirming the demonstrations, an official in charge of economic
planning for Luoyang said the protesters dispersed after the
government pledged to look into the workers' concerns.
	   No one was arrested or hurt, said the official with the city's
Economic and Trade Commission, who only gave his surname, Pan.
	   Small-scale demonstrations have become almost daily occurrences
in many Chinese cities as workers, the unemployed, farmers and
pensioners feel they are losing out to market reforms and being
abandoned by an indifferent or corrupt officialdom.
	   The contentious sale of the Luoyang cement factory underscores
the dangers facing Beijing a year into its ambitious three-year
plan to reform the largely inefficient, virtually bankrupt state
sector.
	   Local officials have been quick to sell the best state assets,
in some cases steering them to cronies. Unrest among workers _ long
used to the cradle-to-grave services of central planning _ has
sharpened.
	   Human Rights in China said the protesters believed that the
privatization plan would leave them without jobs and pensions. They
also contended that the plant was one of the city's top 100
taxpayers as recently as 1996, with 200 million yuan (dlrs 24.2
million) in assets.
	   But the city agreed to sell the factory for 2 million yuan (dlrs
242,000) to the private Zhongtai Company, Human Rights in China
said.
	   Mr. Pan of the Luoyang Economic and Trade Commission said the
sale will be put on hold until all concerns are settled.

Creditors of GITIC's Hong Kong arm might get just 54 cents on
</HEADLINE>
dollar &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Creditors of the Hong Kong subsidiary of the
collapsed Guangdong International Trust and Investment Corp. might
get just 54 cents on the dollar, liquidators said Monday.
	   The accounting company KPMG Peat Marwick said after a closed
creditors' meeting it has been appointed as provisional liquidator
of GITIC Hong Kong, whose assets will be sold off to repay bankers.
	   KPMG Peat Marwick partner Gabriel Tam said the book value of
GITIC Hong Kong's assets is 3.6 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 462 million), while liabilities come to 3.2 billion Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 410 million).
	   It remains unclear how much money the liquidators can actually
raise by selling GITIC Hong Kong's assets, as the accountants are
unlikely to find purchasers willing to pay full book value.
	   Tam confirmed to reporters that a payout of 54 cents on the
dollar was under discussion.
	   Tam also confirmed that a creditors committee has been formed
with representatives from the Bank of East Asia, Dai-Ichi Kangyo
Bank, China Merchants Bank, CCIC Finance Ltd. and GITIC, the failed
parent of GITIC Hong Kong.
	   Dow Jones Newswires quoted a U.S. banker, whom it did not
identify, as saying the major asset of GITIC Hong Kong is its
controlling stake in GITIC Enterprises Ltd., a marble and granite
importer whose shares have been suspended from trading in Hong
Kong.
	   GITIC Enterprises is not a candidate for liquidation, though the
accountants need to find a buyer for GITIC Hong Kong's stake in the
company, said another KPMG partner, Alan Tang.
	   China's central bank closed GITIC Oct. 6, raising questions
about the soundness of loans made to the institution that served as
fund-raising arm of the Guangdong provincial government.
	   Beijing has said it will repay any loans to GITIC that were
properly registered with Chinese authorities, but many of the loans
made in Hong Kong were not registered and their safety remains
unclear.
	   Bankers have estimated all of GITIC's debts could total U.S.
dlrs 2 billion.

Enis tears knee ligament, out for season
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NANCY ARMOUR &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Curtis Enis' rookie season is done before it ever
really got started.
	   Enis, who made his first NFL start, tore the anterior cruciate
ligament in his left knee and will miss the rest of the season, the
Chicago Bears said in a statement released several hours after a
20-12 loss to the St. Louis Rams.
	   He'll have surgery in the next few weeks, and rehabilitation is
expected to take 7-to-10 months.
	   The injury occurred Sunday late in the third quarter, though
Enis was still playing in the second-to-last series of the game. He
didn't show any visible signs of being hurt, and didn't mention it
when he spoke with reporters afterward.
	   ``He kept going back in the game and playing with it,'' coach
Dave Wannstedt said.
	   The team announced the injury in the post-game notes, saying
Enis would have an MRI for a sprained knee. But defensive end Mark
Thomas, a close friend of Enis', said Enis told his teammates about
the injury and expressed concern.
	   ``I talked to Curtis after the game and obviously something was
wrong and I went over and asked him,'' said Steve Stenstrom, who
also made his first NFL start Sunday in place of the injured Erik
Kramer. ``We're praying for him.''
	   The injury is a bitter end to what's been a troubled season for
the fifth overall pick of the draft. Enis, who left Penn State
early after accepting clothing from an agent, missed almost all of
training camp in a bitter holdout and found himself behind veteran
Edgar Bennett.
	   Though he had some long, breakaway runs that displayed his
immense talent, there were questions about whether he could accept
coaching. Some veteran players told Wannstedt they thought Bennett
gave the Bears the best chance to win.
	   But Enis learned, and Wannstedt announced last week that the
rookie had earned his first start. And on Sunday, he seemed poised
to become the featured back the Bears hoped when they drafted him.
	   Enis finishes with a team-high 497 yards on 133 carries this
year, but he didn't score a touchdown.
	   Though the Bears still have Bennett, the loss of Enis is more
bad news for a team now 3-6. Kramer, who's been one of the NFC's
top quarterbacks, missed Sunday's game with a strained rotator cuff
and tendinitis in his throwing shoulder. It's not known when he'll
return.

France provides 212 million francs for coffee development
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ France has signed an agreement to provide
212 million francs (dlrs 38.5 million) in preferential loans to
further develop Vietnam's coffee industry, a Vietnamese Finance
Ministry official said Monday.
	   Under the agreement signed between the Finance Ministry and
France Development Agency last week, the 20-year loans, with an
annual interest rate of 3.5 percent and a 10-year grace period,
will be disbursed in the next two months, the official said.
	   The money will be given to the Vietnam Coffee Corp., which will
lend it to farmers in 14 northern and central provinces to plant
40,000 hectares (100,000 acres) of arabica coffee and facilitate
processing industries, he said.
	   ``The aim of the project is to eliminate starvation and
alleviate poverty in these poor provinces,'' he said.
	   This is France Development Agency's biggest loan for Vietnam's
agriculture sector, he said.
	   The central highlands are Vietnam's main coffee area, where
primarily robusta is planted.
	   Robusta is considered slightly more bitter than arabica, the
world's most popular coffee. Brazil and Bolivia dominate the
arabica market, in which Vietnam _ one the largest robusta
producers _ hopes to make inroads over the next decade.
	   The country has exported more than 390,000 tons of coffee so far
this year, fetching nearly dlrs 600 million.

More than 100 inmates escape from prison in Indonesian city
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ When more than 100 prisoners escaped
from an Indonesian jail this weekend, they did it the easy way.
They walked out the front gate.
	   Security guards apparently forgot to lock the doors after
visiting hours for inmates' families ended Sunday, the newspaper
Kompas quoted the military as saying.
	   Four officers were injured when 106 prisoners broke out of
Merdeka Penitentiary in Palembang on Sumatra Island and police have
recaptured only three fugitives.
	   ``Merdeka'' means ``freedom'' in Indonesia.
	   The breakout occurred while guards were changing shifts, Kompas
quoted Brig. Gen. Pandji Atmasudirdja, the regional police chief,
as saying. The city, a center of the oil industry, is 460
kilometers (285 miles) northwest of Jakarta, the capital.

New Zealand to expand role of third umpire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP) _ New Zealand Cricket is
expanding the role of the third umpire to include all decisions
except leg before wicket (lbw) when television replays are
available.
	   National umpiring manager Brian Aldridge, who instigated the
move, said Monday the aim was to assist umpires.
	   ``If people in their living rooms can watch replays a few
seconds later and decide whether it's right or wrong then we feel
the umpire out in the middle should have the benefit of that
help,'' he said.
	   The third umpire is used internationally to help with runouts,
stumpings, hit-wicket and boundary-line decisions.
	   The expanded system was used last weekend in the domestic Shell
Super Max league tournament in Christchurch.
	   Umpire Chris King called for assistance during the
Auckland-Northern Districts match to help clarify a decision. It
involved uncertainty over a caught behind appeal where there had
been a sound as the ball went past the bat.
	   The fielders appealed and subsequent replays showed the bat had
hit the ground, not the edge, and the batsman was given not out.
	   The move is being used in televised Max matches and if
successful will be used in Shell Cup fixtures. (djp)

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A U.S. congressman has arrived in
North Korea to look into food shortages there, the communist
country's media reported Monday.
	   A one-sentence dispatch by the North's Korean Central News
Agency said Rep. Tony P. Hall, an Ohio Democrat, flew into
Pyongyang, the North's capital, on Sunday. It gave no details.
	   Hall, an expert on hunger and poverty who has traveled widely in
Africa and Asia, had said earlier he would try to measure the
extent of the food shortages during the five-day visit.
	   It was Hall's fourth visit to North Korea since 1996 and his
first this year.
	   On his way home, the congressman will stop in Seoul to brief
South Korean officials and speak to reporters.

Anti-government strike paralyzes Bangladeshi cities

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Police used tear gas to disperse
opposition activists who rioted on Monday to try to enforce a
nationwide strike to protest what they said was an attempt by
police to kill their leader.
	   Witnesses said at least 30 people were injured in the clashes at
the start of the planned two-day strike. Dhaka, the capital city of
nine million people, was paralyzed and 60 other cities were
affected, United News of Bangladesh news agency reported.
	   Rioters smashed vehicle and set off firecrackers in many cities
around Bangladesh.
	   The strike was called by an alliance of seven parties headed by
former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia to protest the tear gassing of a
rally on Saturday that forced Mrs. Zia to flee before making a
speech.
	   Mrs. Zia said the tear gassing was an attempt on her life, and
criticized the government's ``undemocratic and repressive'' action.
	   The traditional political rivalry _ often violent _ was
heightened by Sunday's conviction and death sentences for the
plotters of a 1975 coup in which Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the
country's first prime minister, was assassinated.
	   Some of the coup leaders were associated with the opposition.
The current prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, is the daughter of the
assassinated leader.
	   In Dhaka the strike stopped traffic and stores, private offices,
banks and schools shut. Some rickshaw drivers, too poor to lose a
day's income of 100 taka (dlrs 2), defied the strike and risked
having their vehicles smashed.
	   Stores close because owners fear the shops will be damaged or
looted if they defy the strike. Many people stay at home becase
there's no public transportation and private cars are often stoned.
	   Government offices opened, but attendance was poor, the UNB news
agency said.
	   Authorities deployed more than 5,000 security forces in an
attempt to stem violence.
	   The strike deterred more street celebrations by the governing
Awami League to welcome Sunday's conviction of 15 former military
officers involved in the coup. The officers have the right to
appeal their sentences.

Khai learns from Chinese reform experiences
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van Khai
says his recent trip to Beijing provided valuable lessons in the
Chinese experience in macro-management.
	   He said he will send officials to China to learn about their
administrative reforms, which have trimmed half the personnel from
the central and local government apparatus in recent years.
	   Khai said in the Youth newspaper Monday that Vietnam will
streamline the government structure by the year 2000 to replace the
cumbersome and overlapping system.
	   ``The whole political system, which includes the party,
government and mass organizations, needs to be restructured,'' Khai
said.
	   Over the past few years, Vietnam has been trying to streamline
the Communist Party and government structure, but a government
report to the current National Assembly session says the number of
personnel on the payroll is on the rise instead.
	   ``Our streamlining policy has not been carried out because of
the absence of specific solutions and lack of consensus (among the
party and government),'' Khai said.
	   He said the party's resolutions are clear, but implementation
has been slow due to different ideas and approaches.
	   ``I have to say that China has better discipline than we do,''
Khai said.
	   Khai paid a visit to China late last month, the first by a
Vietnamese prime minister since the two countries normalized
relations in 1991.
	   Vietnam has increasingly looked to China's example of how to
reform a stodgy command economy into a market-oriented one.

Reconciliation unlikely until sides settle ownership question
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEVE HERMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ To turbocharge or not to turbocharge. That's
not necessarily the question.
	   While the Indy Racing League is preparing to unveil its new
engine specifications later this month, engine builders from the
rival Championship Auto Racing Teams have offered a possible
compromise to settle their 3-year-old dispute.
	   But a bigger issue, one that could still keep the two racing
factions apart, is whether each team will be allowed to own and
work on its own engines. CART currently requires its teams to lease
engines from the manufacturers.
	   ``If they say, `We will only do a leasing program and won't let
our teams own the engines,' I don't know that there will be any
progress,'' Indianapolis Motor Speedway spokesman Fred Nation said
Sunday.
	   CART's teams run turbocharged engines, while the IRL uses
4-liter normally aspirated Oldsmobile and Nissan engines. IRL's
revised specifications are expected to be unveiled around Nov. 21 _
give or take a few days, Nation said.
	   ``What we will announce, while it will be different, will follow
our philosophy of having engines that are available and
affordable,'' he said.
	   And that means there will be no change in the IRL stance that
its teams will be able to buy engines.
	   CART has boycotted the Indianapolis 500 since Speedway president
Tony George launched the IRL in 1996 in protest of escalating costs
and a trend toward road courses. The IRL runs its series on
traditional oval tracks.
	   The IRL this year already eliminated one difference _ a rule
that guaranteed a certain number of starting spots to IRL regulars
_ but a huge problem still is the engine and chassis formulas used
by the two camps. Both sides plan new packages for next season.
	   CART's manufacturers lease their engines to race teams,
controlling the entire process of building, on-track maintenance
and rebuilding. The IRL allows its teams to buy and control its own
engines from a half-dozen approved builders.
	   Officials from engine manufacturers Honda, Ford, Mercedes and
Toyota submitted a new engine formula to George several months ago,
The Indianapolis Star reported Sunday. But Paul Ray, the CART
program manager for Ilmor Engineering, said there would be no
compromise regarding the lease option.
	   ``We ought to be at Indianapolis if we can, but not at any
price,'' Ray told the newspaper.
	   George was out of town and could not be reached for comment.
	   Nation, a Speedway vice president, confirmed there have been
discussions over the past few months with various CART teams and
engine builders, ``but it's too early to say what this will lead
to.''
	   ``A number of the CART team members would like to return to the
Indy 500,'' he said. ``They believe the way to do that is to have
engine standards that are similar between the two leagues. ... Once
we make our announcement, presumably the CART folks will decide
whether they want to move in the same direction.''

Man arrested after 17 years in hiding
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A man who spent the last 17 years in
hiding after fatally shooting a colleague has been arrested in
southern Vietnam, local police said Monday.
	   Huynh Xuan Sanh, 35, was taken into custody last month in An
Giang province after police received a report on his whereabouts
from the family of the man he is accused of killing, police officer
Nguyen Tuan Anh said.
	   According to reports at the time, Sanh, a former taxman, shot Ho
Van Phuc while they played with a gun. Phuc first pointed the gun
at Sanh and pulled the trigger, but the hammer clicked on an empty
chamber. When Sanh did the same thing, the gun went off.
	   Sanh fled his home province, An Giang, to neighboring Kien Giang
province, where he changed his name to Tran Van Thanh and found a
job as a primary school teacher, Anh said.
	   It is unknown when or if he will face trial.

Incumbent mayor scores razor-thin victory in Bucharest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Mayor Viorel Lis has won a narrow
victory to keep his post as head of Romania's capital city for the
next two years, near-final results showed Monday.
	   Lis received 50.5 percent of the votes, according to the Central
Election Bureau, based on results from 965 of 1,175 voting
stations. Sorin Oprescue, director of the city's Municipal
Hospital, was trailing with 49.5 percent.
	   Final results were expected later Monday.
	   Turnout was low for the third straight Sunday, with fewer than
half the 1.7 million eligible voters casting ballots.
	   Lis, 55, was the previous mayor's deputy and has been running
this city of 3 million since December 1996. He represents the
Democratic Convention, the main political force of the ruling
coalition which has run Bucharest since 1992.
	   Oprescu was supported by the leftist Party of Social Democracy
and nationalist parties. Some 22 candidates ran for elections. The
race was whittled down to Lis and Oprescu, who finished well ahead
of the other candidates, but failed to get over 50 percent for an
outright victory in the first two rounds.
	   Bucharest is overcrowded and plagued by problems with
substandard housing and a poor water supply, deteriorated roads and
pollution. Since 1989 when communism ended, problems have gotten
worse as the city's population has increased.
	   The election was necessary after previous mayor Victor Ciorbea
quit the post to become prime minister in 1996. He resigned from
that job in April, quitting as mayor at the same time.

Microsoft strengthens anti-piracy efforts in Thailand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ In the latest move aimed at curbing the
widespread use of illegally copied software, Microsoft announced
Monday that is establishing an anti-piracy telephone hot line in
Thailand.
	   The hot line will allow informants to receive cash rewards for
calling in the names of businesses suspected of selling or using
pirated versions of Microsoft software products.
	   The hot line will be publicized as part of a public awareness
campaign on the negative effects that software piracy has on
Thailand's economy, Microsoft executives said at a news conference.
	   ``Depending on the results of our investigations, a caller
stands to gain up to 250,000 baht (dlrs 6,940) for his or her
services,'' Microsoft public relations officer Alex Mercer said.
	   Weak intellectual property laws and corrupt police contribute to
the trade in pirated software in Thailand, which industry sources
say accounts for as much as 84 percent of software sales.
	   Illustrating the enormity of its battle against piracy in
Thailand, Microsoft attorney Ron Eckstrom estimated that illegally
copied software accounts for 99 percent of sales at a Bangkok
shopping mall specializing in computer products.
	   The Business Software Alliance, a worldwide organization of
software companies, already has a hot line in Thailand to combat
piracy, and Microsoft said its separate program would work closely
with the BSA.
	   Eckstrom admitted that past efforts to persuade Thais to help
fight piracy have been stymied by a public perception that software
makers are foreign companies making huge profits from Thailand.
	   But the Microsoft attorney said the country's economic downturn
and a recently completed report estimating that software piracy
robs Thailand of thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in tax
revenue could change public opinion.
	   ``As the economy repairs itself here, there is a growing
awareness that intellectual property rights must be protected to
attract outside investment,'' Eckstrom said.
	   Microsoft's anti-piracy campaign will not target private users
of illegally copied software because the company has determined
that the vast majority of pirated software purchases are made by
businesses, Eckstrom said.

Irish politician tries to mediate in Iraq crisis

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A visiting Irish politician said Monday he
believes Iraq is willing to compromise to head off threatened
military action over suspended U.N. weapons inspections.
	   ``We believe that with good will on both sides, that a
compromise could be worked out,'' Former Irish Prime Minister
Albert Reynolds told reporters.
	   He said he met with Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz,
for more than two hours on Sunday. He described Aziz as ``open''
and ``very flexible.''
	   Reynolds also appealed to the United States and Britain to
abandon threats of a military strike and to negotiate a settlement.
	   Reynolds, a member of the Irish Parliament, was credited with
encouraging the Irish Republic Army's 1994 cease-fire. He planned
to leave Iraq later Monday and said he would travel to the United
States on Thursday to confer with American politicians.
	   Also Monday, five more inspectors from the U.N. Special
Commission _ which is responsible for elimination of Iraq's
chemical and biological weapons as well as long-range missiles _
left the country.
	   Caroline Cross, UNSCOM spokeswoman in Baghdad, said 10 more
inspectors are to depart Wednesday, which will raise the total to
30 since UNSCOM began the partial pull out Saturday.
	   She noted that more than 100 U.N. weapons staffers remain in the
country and could resume inspections immediately if Iraq changes it
positions.
	   Iraq announced on Oct. 31 that it was halting cooperation with
UNSCOM until the Security Council begins moving to lift the
sanctions imposed to punish Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The sanctions, which ban the sale of oil and other financial
dealings, have devastated Iraq's economy.
	   On Sunday, U.S. President Bill Clinton met with top security
advisers, but put off a decision on whether to use force against
Iraq to reopen military sites to U.N. inspectors.
	   Reynolds said: ``Today I would like to send a very clear message
and a clear call to the United Nations, to President Clinton and to
(British) Prime Minister Tony Blair that whatever (their feelings)
about the conflict, that everybody gets around the table to
dialogue and debate and talk to remove the sanctions.''
	   Reynolds suggested that the United Nations lift sanctions on
medicine to allow a free flow of pharmaceutical supplies into Iraq.
	   ``I think there would be a corresponding response from Tariq
Aziz and the Iraqi government'' to such a goodwill gesture, he
said.
	   ``Nobody wants to see a resumption of a conflict that has such
horrendous repercussions on the people of Iraq and on the children
that are suffering most of all,'' Reynolds said.
	   The Security Council has said the embargo won't be lifted until
U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of
mass destruction, as required by U.N. resolutions that ended the
1991 Gulf War over the Kuwait occupation.
	   Although Iraq halted UNSCOM's work, it exempted monitors from
the Vienna-headquartered International Atomic Energy Agency. Two
IAEA teams went into the field on Monday, as they have on most days
this month. They were accompanied by UNSCOM technicians who were
collecting samples from air sensors, Ms. Cross said.
	   On Sunday, Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh told
reporters that Iraq did not fear a military strike.
	   ``They will not kill in a military strike more than they are
killing with sanctions every day,'' he said.

Evolving viruses the challenge for medicine, WHO expert says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Infectious diseases are evolving
faster than man's ability to combat them, a World Health
Organization expert said Monday.
	   Dr. David Heymann, executive director of WHO's communicable
diseases programs, said the challenge of the next century would be
to provide resources to control infections as well as combat
growing public health problems such as the diseases of aging and
smoking.
	   ``One-third of the people who are dying in the world today are
dying of infectious diseases, and this is inexcusable in a world
where there are drugs to treat disease and vaccines which can
prevent it,'' Heymann said before attending a communicable diseases
conference.
	   ``We still have a lot of unfinished business as we go into the
21st century.''
	   If a new disease emerges, it would take six months to develop a
vaccine, he said.
	   Heymann, who took part in investigating the first outbreak of
ebola more than 20 years ago, said such new viruses were the
biggest challenge.
	   ``Apart from the endemic diseases, we face emerging diseases
which don't kill very many people but cause chaos in the world _
they close airports and they close countries,'' he said.
	   Heymann said world health authorities faced a constantly
evolving challenge from the evolution of diseases.
	   Monkeypox, a virus that jumps from animals to humans, was the
latest to cause concern in Africa because the vaccine that prevents
it can kill people with HIV.
	   The vaccine used against monkeypox is the same as that used
against smallpox, which is now eradicated.
	   ``In the last two years, we have seen a big outbreak of
monkeypox in central Zaire (the Congo), an epidemic of over 300
cases,'' Heymann said.
	   ``Twenty years ago we could have vaccinated the entire
population for smallpox and prevented monkeypox as well but now we
can't do that because there is HIV in this population.
	   ``One disease disappears (smallpox), one disease appears (HIV
AIDS) and that's completely changed how we relate to the third
disease, monkeypox,'' he said.
	   There was no treatment for monkeypox and at least 10 percent of
people who contract it will die. Education of people is now the
only way to prevent it.

Afghan Taliban say they are ready to extend cease fire
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AMIR ZIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's religious militia is
ready to extend a cease fire with its opponents to give peace in
their war-battered homeland a chance, a Taliban minister said.
	   ``We are prepared for peace,'' Taliban's deputy minister of
health Sher Abbas Stanikzai said in an interview Saturday with the
Associated Press. ``The cease fire deadline ended a week ago, but
none of the sides have violated the truce so far.''
	   In a conciliatory gesture, Stanikzai made an appeal to the the
Taliban's main opponent, former defense chief Ahmed Shah Massood.
	   ``We request him to stop fighting and lay down his arms in the
larger national interest,'' he said.
	   Massood's Jamiat-e-Islami, led by former Afghan President
Burhanuddin Rabbani, is the only strong opposition group resisting
the Taliban. Massood's forces have recaptured some lost ground
including Taloqan, the capital of the northern Takhar province from
the hard-line Islamic militia.
	   But the Taliban reject the opposition's demand to share power.
	   He said the Muslim insurgents, led by Massood _ who took power
from the communists in 1992 after fighting to oust invading Soviet
soldiers _forfeited their right to rule when they turned their guns
on each other.
	   More than 50,000 people -- most of them civilians -- died in a
ferocious battle between Massood and his arch rival Gulbuddin
Hekmatyar. The battle ended in June 1996 when Hekmatyar was sworn
in as prime minister. But three months later the Taliban took
control of Kabul.
	   ``All the Mujahedeen groups were part of President Burhanuddin
Rabbani's government. But they could not work as a government and
destroyed the country by their years of bloody fighting,'' he said.
``The Taliban (movement) rose as a result of infighting among
Mujahedeen . . . now we don't want a government on paper.''
	   Last month the Taliban and Massood's forces agreed to a cease
fire and prisoner exchange. The agreement was the result of peace
negotiations by Said Jalal, a close aide of Saudi Arabia's Crown
Prince Abdullah.
	   Stanikzai said there has been no direct contact between the
Taliban and Massood. Both sides have agreed to let Jalal negotiate.
	   ``We have observed the cease fire and are releasing each others'
prisoners. . . now we have to see what Jalal wants in the third
phase,'' he said.
	   Stanikzai said this is not the first prisoner exchange, but it
is the first truce negotiated in more than one year.
	   The Taliban, which controls almost 90 percent of Afghanistan
including the capital Kabul, are Sunni Muslims and mostly ethnic
Pashtuns - the majority ethnic group in Afghanistan.
	   The opposition comprises mostly of religious and ethnic
minorities including Shiites, Tajiks, Uzbeks and Hazaras.
	   ``Without forcefully disarming all the factions and stopping
foreign interference, peace can't be restored here,'' Stanikzai
said.

Japanese stocks mixed, dollar higher
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Wraps up with late dollar, closing bond, comments &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks closed mixed Monday as investors
awaited more details of the Japanese government's latest economic
stimulus measures. The U.S. dollar rose against the yen on renewed
tension between the United States and Iraq.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 72.57
points, or 0.51 percent, closing at 14,194.54. On Friday, it had
fallen 218.40 points, or 1.53 percent.
	   The dollar bought 119.36 yen in late afternoon, up 1.36 yen from
late Friday in Tokyo and also above its New York level of 119.10
yen Friday. It now has gained a total of 3.66 yen in Tokyo's last
four trading days.
	   On Monday, the dollar ranged between 119.08 yen and 119.69 yen.
	   Share prices opened higher following gains in U.S. stocks Friday
and on expectations of more active economic rescue efforts by the
government. But the gains later ran out of steam in the absence of
new information about the measures.
	   ``Many participants remained sidelined to await upcoming
economic measures,'' said Kunihiro Hatae, general manager at Tokyo
Securities Co.
	   Next Monday, the government is expected to announce a package of
public works and other measures expected to total more than 10
trillion yen (dlrs 84 billion). The governing Liberal Democratic
Party is to release the basic contents of the package later this
week.
	   The market also received a boost from a Kyodo News agency report
that Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi pledged in talks with former Prime
Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone on Saturday that he would study a
proposal to cut the consumption tax to 3 percent from the current 5
percent.
	   The increase in the tax to 5 percent from 3 percent in April
1997 is considered one of the major causes of Japan's recession.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 5.31 points, or 0.49 percent, to 1,084.16.
It had slipped 15.10 points, or 1.37 percent, Friday.
	   Volume on the first section was estimated at 290 million shares,
down from 339.20 million Friday.
	   In currency dealings, the dollar gained early in the day amid
speculation that the United States might use force to try to reopen
Iraqi weapons sites to U.N. inspectors, traders said. The U.S.
currency, considered a financial safe haven, often strengthens in
times of crisis.
	   On Sunday, President Bill Clinton directed his senior advisers
to weigh military and diplomatic strategies for a few more days.
Iraqi ministers said they would not back away from their decision
to bar U.N. inspections unless crippling economic sanctions were
lifted.
	   Fifteen U.N. weapons inspectors left Baghdad Saturday as the
United Nations began to reduce its presence in Iraq.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond slipped to 0.825 percent from Friday's finish of 0.835
percent, driving its price up to 109.67 yen from 108.58 yen.

East Timor activists sue Malaysian police for dlrs 23 million
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOCELYN GECKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian human rights activists
filed an 87 million ringgit (dlrs 23 million) lawsuit against
police officials Monday for arresting participants at an East Timor
conference two years ago.
	   ``We were wrongfully detained, falsely imprisoned and denied our
constitutional rights,'' said Sansui Osman, one of 107 people
arrested at the 1996 Asia-Pacific Conference on East Timor in Kuala
Lumpur.
	   The meeting was disrupted when protesters from the governing
National Front coalition barged into the conference room and tore
down banners, according to a home video shown to reporters Monday.
	   Police later arrested and detained for up to six days 47
foreigners and 60 Malaysians at the conference, which had been
banned by the government. After the arrests, officials said the
meeting was ``insensitive to Indonesia-Malaysia ties.''
	   The lawsuit announcement came three days ahead of the
anniversary of the 1991 Dili massacre in East Timor, where the
Indonesian army opened fire on pro-independence protesters.
	   Organizers accused police Monday of working in collusion with
ruling party members to foil the activists, who were demanding that
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations help resolve the East
Timor dispute.
	   The lawsuit names as defendants Police Commissioner Ismail
Che'Ros and Deputy Police Commissioner Zainal Abidin Ali.
	   A High Court ruled last year that some of the detentions were
illegal and questioned the mass arrest, said Sivarasa Rasiah, a
Malaysian human rights lawyer and one of the 36 people filing the
lawsuit.
	   ``(Police) must be held responsible for their mistakes and
accountable for their actions,'' said Sanusi, adding, ``We are
alarmed with mounting evidence that the police force is abusing its
power.''
	   He cited an anti-government rally last month that turned violent
when riot police with truncheons fired tear gas and water cannons
into a mosque. Demonstrators hurled stones back at police. It was
the first riot in Malaysia nearly 30 years.
	   Police also came under criticism recently for fatally shooting
an eight-month pregnant woman during an ambush of alleged
kidnappers.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed it the next
year. The United Nations does not recognize Indonesia's rule over
the territory, a former Portuguese colony.

Iran to complain about U.S.-radio at the Hague tribunal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran will protest to the International Court
of Justice at the Hague and other global bodies about the
U.S.-funded Radio Free Europe, the Iran Daily reported Monday.
	   It quoted Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi as saying the radio
``was set up to interfere in Iran's internal affairs.''
	   It did not say when the complaints will be filed. The
English-language daily also did not say which organizations Iran
will approach besides the ICJ in the Netherlands.
	   On Tuesday, Iran recalled its ambassador from Prague to protest
the Czech government's assistance to the radio and said it would
reduce the level of its economic and political cooperation with
Prague.
	   The American-sponsored station also began broadcasts directed to
Iraq on Friday. In a trial period of several weeks, the station
will broadcast one 30-minute program a day to Iran and Iraq.
	   The Farsi-language service to Iran was approved by the Czech
government in August.
	   Radio Free Europe began transmitting from Munich, Germany, in
1951, spreading uncensored news to Soviet-controlled countries
behind the Iron Curtain during the Cold War between the West and
the Communist East.
	   It moved its headquarters to Prague in 1995 following the
collapse of communism six years earlier.

Ban on thalidomide doctor lifted, five years after fraud
</HEADLINE>
conviction &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The man credited with alerting the
world to thalidomide's dangers to unborn children won the right
Monday to practice medicine again, five years after being
deregistered in Australia for scientific fraud.
	   An elated and emotional Dr. William McBride welcomed a ruling of
the New South Wales state Medical Tribunal that he now was a fit
and proper person to practice medicine.
	   In 1993, the 71-year-old obstetrician was found guilty of
committing scientific fraud by changing data, adding false
information and wrongly describing his experimental methods in an
article _ published in a scientific journal in 1982 _ on the
effects of the drug Debendox.
	   In striking his name off the medical register, the tribunal
found then that McBride lacked moral and intellectual honesty.
	   He unsuccessfully applied for reregistration in 1996, but the
tribunal decided he had not shown he had reformed his character.
	   On Monday, the tribunal said McBride will be reregistered on
condition that he not undertake medical research; be supervised for
such period as determined by the Medical Board; and not perform
surgery until he has satisfied the board of his competence.
	   Speaking after the decision, a teary-eyed and smiling McBride
told reporters he was ``very happy to get back to medicine'' and
wanted to work at the only hospital in American Samoa.
	   At the hearing, McBride apologized, admitted the deliberate
fraud and said his continued attempts to justify the paper had been
wrong.
	   Tribunal Judge Reg Blanch said the 1996 tribunal decision was
primarily based on the finding that McBride did not have an insight
into the reasons for his deregistration.
	   ``The doctor now frankly admits that it was his dishonesty which
caused his deregistration,'' he said.
	   Once widely used to treat nausea during pregnancy, thalidomide
was found in 1961 to contribute to birth defects, including severe
malformation of children's' arms. The case led to stringent new
government regulations for drug testing.

Hong Kong share prices slump

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices in Hong Kong slumped Monday, with
the key index tumbling 2.8 percent as investors took profits
following sharp gains in recent weeks.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
fell 287.82 points, closing at 9,851.93. On Friday, the index had
lost 82.23 points.
	   Turnover fell to 5.72 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 733
million) from Friday's 9.60 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
1.23 billion).
	   Brokers said the profit-taking was expected after the index
gained more than 30 percent between late September and last week.
	   ``The market has run out of steam,'' said Jerry Pang, sales
director at HSBC Securities Ltd.
	   Among properties, Sun Hung Kai Properties fell 3.25 Hong Kong
dollars to 50.00, and Cheung Kong fell 2.00 dollars to 53.00.
	   In the banking sector, HSBC Holdings fell 6.00 dollars to
180.00, and Hang Seng Bank fell 75 cents to 64.25.
	   Elsewhere, Swire Pacific ``A'' fell 2.20 dollars to 33.10, and
Hutchison Whampoa fell 1.75 dollars to 51.25.

 &UR; HONDURAS: Aid shipments arrive for Mitch victims &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Aid shipments poured into Central
America on Sunday as workers struggled to get food, water and
medicine to flood victims before more die in regions battered by
Hurricane Mitch.
	   Assisting a beleaguered Honduran Red Cross, the American Red
Cross on Sunday was delivering enough food to feed 1,000 families
for a month in the southern city of Choluteca, which was cut off
from the rest of Honduras until Saturday. Forty tons of water
purification chemicals and antibiotics to stem the spread of
disease were also on the way.
	   ``The Honduran Red Cross is giving out all they have. Everything
incoming is absolutely necessary,'' said American Red Cross
spokeswoman Ann Stingle.
	   Red Cross trucks filled with aid also began rumbling Sunday
morning into Posoltega, Nicaragua, where an estimated 2,000 people
were killed in a mudslide down the volcano's flank.
	   But refugees there complained that the aid had not yet reached
them.
	   ``We heard on the radio that aid is coming, but we're still
eating rice,'' said Ann Soto, 19, at a refugee shelter in
Posoltega.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Governor campaigns for statehood aboard motorcycle
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Even in politics-weary Puerto Rico,
it was a scene that turned heads: the governor on a turquoise
Harley-Davidson, leading a roaring pack of motorcycles on a
campaign ride for U.S. statehood.
	   In a bid to revive flagging interest in a Dec. 13 vote on Puerto
Rico's relationship with the United States, Gov. Pedro Rossello and
dozens motorcycle-owning supporters hit the road Sunday to tout the
benefits of joining the union.
	   ``I am out here because I want you to know we are going to
win,'' he told statehood supporters during a campaign stop.
	   Dozens of glittering machines joined the caravan, which left the
western city of Aguadilla on Sunday morning and arrived Sunday
night at a campaign rally in San Juan, about 100 miles (160
kilometers) away.
	   Police raced ahead of the group with sirens on to clear traffic,
while motorcycles zipped around and between television camera
trucks.
	   Rossello called the vote this summer after a bill that would
have cleared up Puerto Rico's tangled ties with the United States
stalled in the U.S. Congress. Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory, but
its residents cannot vote for president and have no vote in
Congress.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Baby's kidnapping prompts bill to bolster security
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Spurred by the highly publicized
kidnapping of a newborn baby from a maternity ward, lawmakers in
Puerto Rico are considering a bill to beef up security in
hospitals.
	   The measure would require electronic tracking bracelets on
newborns, security cameras at all entrances and a system of
registering all visitors in maternity wards.
	   The Puerto Rican Senate votes on the bill on Monday.
	   Consideration of the measure follows the arrest last week of
Arleen Silva Santiago, 21, on charges she kidnapped 3-day-old
Odalys Cruz Maldonado from a hospital in eastern Humacao in July.
	   Police said Silva Santiago, a candidate for Puerto Rico's police
academy, was being treated in the same hospital because her own
baby had died six months into her pregnancy.
	   The baby's parents claim Silva Santiago approached them, told
them they had won baby food and diapers in a contest, then took the
baby to another room under the pretense of photographing her.
	   Police allege Silva Santiago then put the baby into a carrying
bag and left the hospital.
	   The baby was found last week in Silva Santiago's house in Cidra,
about 20 miles (30 kilometers) from the hospital, after her mother
tipped off police.
 &UR; GUYANA: Yellow fever cases along borders prompt immunizations
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Reacting to reports of yellow fever
infections along Guyana's border with Brazil and Venezuela, health
officials are beginning to immunize Guyanese against the
mosquito-borne disease.
	   The Guyanese health ministry said Sunday it is working with the
Pan American Health Organization to immunize children and the
elderly, who are especially susceptible to the disease.
	   They are also urging residents to eliminate pools of standing
water, where mosquitoes breed. Yellow fever is an acute disease
caused by a virus transmitted by the aedis aegypti mosquito.
	   Officials said they are particularly worried about miners,
loggers and other workers who spend most of their time in Guyana's
thick tropical forests.
	   ``All authorities and individuals must now be aware that they
should do everything to try to destroy the mosquito population in
Guyana,'' health minister Henry Jeffrey said.
	   Brazil is supplying 10,000 doses of the vaccine to help contain
the spread of the disease in communities on the Guyana-Brazil
border.
 &UR; GUYANA: World Bank gives dlrs 9 million loan for El Nino recovery
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ The World Bank has approved a dlrs 9
million loan to help Guyanese farmers hurt by drought linked to the
El Nino weather phenomenon.
	   Most of the money will go toward improving irrigation in
agricultural areas and to provide more water wells, the Guyanese
government said Sunday.
	   The government is providing another dlrs 1.2 million in funding.
	   The money will be spent over three years. Some of the funds will
go toward modernizing the South American country's weather
forecasting service.
	   Interior communities near Venezuela, Suriname and Brazil will
also get potable water pumps. The border communities were among the
worst hit areas last spring, during the height of the drought.
	   The drought crippled Guyana's rice exports and dried up streams,
driving up costs in the gold mining industry, which relies on
rivers to transport equipment through South American forests.
	   The Guyanese Government was forced to seek international
assistance and to send troops to carry aid supplies into remote
villages.
 &UR; BRITAIN: No agreement in cricket crisis talks; talks Monday
	   LONDON (AP) _ Striking West Indian players and Caribbean cricket
officials Sunday failed to end a pay dispute that is threatening to
wipe out a historic three-month tour of South Africa.
	   Courtney Walsh, head of the players' association, said after
seven-hour talks that no solution had been found. He said talks
with West Indian Cricket Board officials would continue late into
Sunday night with no decision expected before Monday.
	   He said he was still hopeful of a settlement.
	   ``Negotiations are still going on,'' Walsh said. ``I'm going
back to speak to the players now. There will be more meetings
tonight and tomorrow.''
	   WICB President Pat Rousseau, arriving Sunday from the Caribbean,
headed the talks with the disgruntled players in a hotel near
Heathrow airport.
	   The crisis began Wednesday when Rousseau fired Brian Lara as
captain and Carl Hooper as vice-captain after they demanded better
pay and conditions for the South African tour.
	   One of the hang ups may be player demands that Lara and Hooper
be reinstated.
	   ``The West Indian Board have conveyed the sticking points to me,
but it's not for me to comment,'' said Ali Bacher, the head of
South African cricket.

Poll: Most Britons want the queen to remain the monarch
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS spelling of throne in lede, sted thrown.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP)_ Most Britons do not think Queen Elizabeth II should
abdicate the throne to allow her oldest son, Prince Charles, to
become king, according to two polls released Monday.
	   A MORI poll commissioned for the tabloid the Daily Mail and GMTV
channel found that 67 percent believe the queen should remain the
monarch for the rest of her life, the paper said.
	   The poll also found that Britain is more supportive of the
relationship between the prince and his longtime love Camilla
Parker Bowles. Only 10 percent said they should split up, the
newspaper said.
	   ``The good news for Charles and Camilla is the highest-ever
level of support for them to conduct their relationship in public _
and eventually to marry,'' the Daily Mail said.
	   But the tabloid also reported that eight of ten Britons do not
want Mrs. Parker Bowles to become queen.
	   The prince, who celebrates his 50th birthday on Saturday, has
enjoyed increased popularity in the year after Princess Diana's
fatal car crash in Paris.
	   But the latest polls come after he has been at the center of
some controversy. A television documentary that aired Sunday quoted
an unnamed ``senior royal aide'' as claiming that Prince Charles
would be ``privately delighted'' if his mother, 72, abdicated.
	   The prince issued a strong denial on Friday, following publicity
about the London Weekend Television program. The producers have
said they stand by their report.
	   And two weeks ago, Prince Charles and Mrs. Parker Bowles were
forced to issue a joint statement that they were not involved ``in
any way'' in a new book that criticizes Princess Diana and purports
to be based on interviews with his friends, family and aides.
	   The MORI poll was based on interviews with 1,019 adults between
Nov. 5-6. The newspaper did not give a margin of error.
	   Meanwhile, another poll published Monday by The Daily Telegraph
mirrored these results. It found that 66 percent of Britons were
against the idea of the queen abdicating. That poll was based on
interviews with 1,036 people.

Iran to complain about U.S.-radio at the Hague tribunal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran will protest to the International Court
of Justice at the Hague and other global bodies about the
U.S.-funded Radio Free Europe, the Iran Daily reported Monday.
	   It quoted Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi as saying the radio
``was set up to interfere in Iran's internal affairs.''
	   It did not say when the complaints will be filed. The
English-language daily also did not say which organizations Iran
will approach besides the ICJ in the Netherlands.
	   On Tuesday, Iran recalled its ambassador from Prague to protest
the Czech government's assistance to the radio and said it would
reduce the level of its economic and political cooperation with
Prague.
	   The American-sponsored station also began broadcasts directed to
Iraq on Friday. In a trial period of several weeks, the station
will broadcast one 30-minute program a day to Iran and Iraq.
	   The Farsi-language service to Iran was approved by the Czech
government in August.
	   Radio Free Europe began transmitting from Munich, Germany, in
1951, spreading uncensored news to Soviet-controlled countries
behind the Iron Curtain during the Cold War between the West and
the Communist East.
	   It moved its headquarters to Prague in 1995 following the
collapse of communism six years earlier.

Qatar mediates between Eritrea and Sudan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DOHA, Qatar (AP) _ The foreign ministers of Eritrea and Sudan
arrived here Monday for talks to be mediated by Qatar on a row over
allegations of Eritrean military incursions into Sudan.
	   Haile Woldensae of Eritrea and Mustafa Osman Ismail of Sudan
were greeted at the airport by their Qatari counterpart Sheik Hamad
bin Jassim bin Jabor al Thani.
	   They will hold talks at the foreign ministry Monday and Tuesday,
said a Qatari official speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Sudanese ambassador Othman Nafie said that each side would
present its view on how to resolve the differences.
	   ``Then the Qataris will try to find common ground between
them,'' Nafie said.
	   Qatar offered to mediate between the two neighbors when its
leader Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa al Thani visited Sudan in June.
	   Sudan, fighting separatists in the south, has accused Eritrea of
aiding Sudanese opposition groups and of sending troops to fight
alongside Sudanese rebels. Eritrea has denied the charges.
	   Sudanese rebels have been fighting since 1983 for greater
autonomy for the Christians and animists in the south from the
Islamic north. More than 1.5 million people have died in the war
and related famines.

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ In a desperate race against time,
relief agencies trying to feed tens of thousands isolated by
Hurricane Mitch struggled to deliver tons of food, despite ruptured
roads, backed-up airports and too few helicopters.
	   Hunger and disease threaten to raise the death toll from Mitch,
which Central American officials estimate has killed more than
10,000 in the region. If confirmed, that would make Mitch among the
five worst hurricanes ever recorded in the Caribbean.
	   ``The Honduran Red Cross is giving out all they have. Everything
incoming is absolutely necessary,'' American Red Cross spokeswoman
Ann Stingle said on Sunday.
	   On Sunday, the first shipments of aid reached many hamlets and
cities cut off by flooding, such as Choluteca in southern Honduras
and Posoltega, Nicaragua, where an estimated 2,000 people were
killed in a mudslide.
	   But some were kept waiting.
	   ``We heard on the radio that aid is coming, but we're still
eating rice,'' said Ann Soto, 19, at a refugee shelter in
Posoltega.

Conservatives manage to postpone vote on controversial bill
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ After 30 hours of debate that lasted until Monday
morning, conservative lawmakers managed to postpone a vote on a
controversial bill to give legal status to unmarried couples.
	   Conservatives throughout the weekend waged a procedural battle
to try to stifle the Socialist-sponsored legislation, known as the
Civil Solidarity Pact, or PACS.
	   The conservatives have proposed more than 1,000 amendments to
the bill, which the government hoped would be adopted Tuesday. The
law was defeated a month ago and reintroduced by the Socialists
with minor changes.
	   After legislators recessed early Monday morning, no new date was
fixed for resuming the discussion on the PACS, which is competing
with debate on the budget.
	   ``Before the end of the year, I guarantee it,'' said Jean-Marc
Ayrault, the leader of the Socialist faction in parliament,
predicting the bill's passage.
	   But conservatives were crowing victory.
	   ``We were supposed to vote Tuesday and we won't vote Tuesday.
Therefore, the opposition has achieved its objective,'' said
Patrick Devedjian, a leading member of the Rally for the Republic
party of President Jacques Chirac.
	   Discussion Sunday was bogged down on Article 1 of the bill,
which outlines is main measures. Conservatives have proposed 500
amendments to this article alone.
	   Thousands of people opposed to the bill marched through the
streets of Paris on Saturday to express their dissatisfaction with
the proposed legislation.
	   Conservatives and other opponents of the bill fear it could lead
to homosexual adoptions.
	   The bill would allow two unrelated people to conclude a union
that would, among other things, allow them to file joint tax
returns, gain inheritance benefits, and take part in the other's
social security coverage.

Travelers face hectic week of strikes in Italy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A strike by airport ground workers forced
cancellation or rescheduling of flights at Italian airports Monday,
the first in a series of walkouts this week that threatened to make
travel in Italy tough going.
	   The exact number of flights affected was not expected to be
known until after the four-hour-walkout, from 12:30 p.m. to 4:30
p.m. (1130-1530 gmt).
	   Airport ground personnel are protesting failed contract talks
and difficult working conditions at Milan's revamped Malpensa
airport, plagued by days of chaos after the new hub opened Oct. 25.
	   Getting around Rome, Italy's capital, will be especially
difficult Thursday due to an overlapping of taxi, bus and tram
strikes. Taxi drivers who are angry at the mayor's plans to make
their hours more flexible and liberalize tariffs have struck for
several days off and on starting in October. This week they plan to
leave their cabs parked from Monday through Friday.
	   Most bus and trams in the capital will be grounded Thursday and
Friday. Drivers are protesting an accord which requires them to
work longer hours.
	   Train workers plan a nationwide, 24-hour strike starting 9 p.m.
(2000 gmt) Nov. 16.

Takanohana upset on tournament's second day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FUKUOKA, Japan (AP) _ Yokozuna (grand champion) Takanohana,
seeking his 21st tournament title and third in a row, fell to
lower-ranked Kaio on Monday, second day of the 15-day Kyushu Grand
Sumo Tournament.
	   Yokozuna Wakanohana and Hawaiian-born ozeki (champion)
Musashimaru remained undefeated at 2-0.
	   No. 1 maegashira (senior wrestler) Kaio drove out Takanohana
after coming short in several previous pushing attempts in a bout
that lasted 70 seconds. A sumo bout usually ends in 5 or 10
seconds.
	   Kaio, who sent out ozeki Takanonami on opening day Sunday, now
stands 2-0. Takanohana is 1-1.
	   In the day's final bout, Wakanohana slapped down No. 1
maegashira Tochiazuma (0-2), who had dashed against him with his
head.
	   Musashimaru, or Fiamalu Penitani, grabbed komusubi (junior
champion second class) Kotonowaka's belt and drove him out, leaving
Kotonowaka at 0-2.
	   Ozeki Takanonami grabbed No. 2 maegashira Higonoumi's belt and
bulldozed him out for his first victory against one defeat.
Higonoumi is 0-2.
	   Sekiwake (junior champion) Chiyotaikai (2-0) tossed down
komusubi Dejima (0-2) after fighting off Dejima's pushing attempts
with hand thrusts.
	   No. 12 maegashira Kyokushuzan, or Mongolian Batbayar Davaa,
charged No. 8 maegashira Wakanojo with an arm throw attempt, but
Wakanojo resisted and sent him out, leaving both wrestlers at 1-1.
	   In the 26-member juryo division, just below the senior makuuchi
division, No. 2-ranked Kyokutenho, or Mongolian Tsevegnyam Nyamjav,
crushed down No. 4-ranked Tomonohana. Both wrestlers are 1-1.
	   No. 10-ranked Hoshitango, or Argentine Imach Marcelo Salomon,
downed No. 11-ranked Miyabiyama with a leg trick, leaving both at
1-1.
	   It was Miyabiyama's first defeat since he joined professional
sumo wrestling from Meiji University. Including his first bout in
the Nagoya Grand Sumo Tournament in July, he had won 15 bouts in a
row, one short of the sumo record for new wrestlers of 16 in a row
by Wajima in 1970. Wajima reached yokozuna rank in July 1973.
	   In makushita, the top junior division, No. 11-ranked Wakaazuma
(1-0), or Yoshinobu Kuroda from Brazil, threw down No. 12-ranked
Masutsuyoshi.
	   No. 5-ranked Hoshiandesu (0-1), or Argentine Jose Antonio
Juarez, was forced out by No. 5-ranked Saitoh.
	   Wrestlers in junior divisions have only seven bouts during the
tournament.

98 percent of Daimler shares swapped for DaimlerChrysler
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ In the final result of a share swap to
create DaimlerChrysler, shareholders exchanged about 98 percent of
shares in Daimler for shares in the new company, Daimler said
Monday.
	   The result of the extended share swap, which ended Friday,
strengthens further the company's initial share swap, which ended
two weeks ago, during which 97 percent of shares were exchanged.
	   The high swap rate was greeted as a sign of support for the
merger with Chrysler.
	   The extended share swap period was necessary in order to give
shareholders the opportunity to exchange a bonus share each got in
exchange for swapping 200 Daimler shares, an offer meant to sweeten
the deal.
	   Unswapped shares will eventually also be melted into the new
company, though no date was set, Daimler said.
	   Four shareholders have launched legal challenges in a Stuttgart
court, alleging Daimler didn't provide enough information about the
deal. But the lawsuits were not expected to interfere with the
merger.
	   The new company begins trading on the New York and Frankfurt
stock exchanges on Nov. 17.

Five militants killed in gunbattle with security forces in Kashmir
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ Security forces shot dead at least five
separatists hiding in a residential area of the Kashmiri capital on
Monday, police said.
	   A group of 10 militants threw hand grenades at government troops
patrolling Srinagar town on Sunday night, and then disappeared into
the Hyderpora enclave where they hid in some newly constructed but
unoccupied houses, witnesses and police said.
	   Soldiers cordoned off the area and began shooting at the
militants who responded with gunfire. Five militants were killed
and three soldiers were injured. Senior police officials were at
the site of the fighting directing the operations.
	   In a separate incident late Sunday, government troops and
separatists fought near Kupwara town in which five militants and
one soldier were killed.
	   Dozens of separatist rebel groups have been fighting security
forces in India's intractable northern Kashmir state since 1989.
More than 15,000 people have been killed and thousands have been
displaced in the fighting.

Leftist extremists gun down seven in eastern India
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Leftist extremists gunned down seven
people believed to be members of an outlawed upper caste militia,
domestic news agencies reported Monday.
	   The killings appeared to be in revenge for the deaths in July of
rebels from the People's Unity group, police said, according to the
United News of India.
	   The People's Unity is one of several groups fighting for the
redistribution of land among landless peasants and for the
establishment of a Maoist-Leninist state in central and eastern
India.
	   The victims in the killings Sunday night belonged to the Ranbir
Sena, a militia of upper caste Hindus who work for landlords in the
predominantly feudal state of Bihar. Members of the Sena are
believed responsible for massacres of lower caste Hindus, many of
whom are subsistence farmers or bonded laborers in huge farms run
by upper caste landlords.
	   Police said the extremists raided Rampur village late Sunday and
fired point blank at the victims. Four of them were members of one
family believed to be involved in the July killings.
	   Local residents said eight people were abducted by the attackers
but police had no confirmation.
	   The extremists also attacked another neighboring village,
Ahyara, but details were not immediate available.

Angels offering dlrs 72 million for Vaughn
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD ULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Now that Mo Vaughn has his first free-agent offer
_ one that stunned him by its size _ the Boston Red Sox may finally
make a move to get him to stay.
	   Red Sox chief executive officer John Harrington said he didn't
want to make the first offer that Vaughn could use to elicit
others. So the Anaheim Angels stepped in with a six-year, dlrs 72
million offer, according to a source familiar with the
negotiations.
	   That's not as much as the six-year, dlrs 75 million deal Pedro
Martinez signed with Boston before last season or the seven-year,
dlrs 91 million contract Mike Piazza signed recently to stay with
the New York Mets.
	   But it's a start, and a lot more than Boston's last offer of
four years for dlrs 37 million made during the All-Star break.
Vaughn has said he wants a five-year deal, and the Angels went even
further.
	   ``I was just shocked that it happened so soon,'' Vaughn said in
an interview with the Boston Globe. ``They just told us what they
were going to give us and I was stunned.''
	   But Vaughn said many other factors, such as his family's
opinion, the ballpark he'd play in and the team's chances of
winning, also would affect his decision.
	   The slugging first baseman had 40 homers and 115 RBIs last
season. He hit .337, losing the batting race to Bernie Williams of
the New York Yankees on the final day of the regular season.
	   Vaughn earned dlrs 6.6 million in the last year of a three-year
deal and filed for free agency after the season. Boston didn't take
advantage of its 15-day exclusive period to sign him, and he became
eligible to receive other offers last Friday. That's when the
Angels made their move.
	   The amount of Anaheim's offer was confirmed by a source who
spoke on the condition he not be identified.
	   The Red Sox already have announced a 15 percent increase in
ticket prices to pay for Vaughn or whoever they sign in his place.
Whoever that would be would have a tough time matching what Vaughn
achieved _ the 1995 AL MVP award and at least 35 homers in each of
the past four seasons.
	   He also is a clubhouse leader respected by his teammates and
active in the community.

Leone wins National's Grand Prix again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARGARET LILLARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Twenty years ago, Peter Leone was a jubilant
18-year-old at the National Horse Show celebrating his first Grand
Prix victory.
	   Since then he's placed in countless Grand Prix competitions,
ridden for his country in 17 Nations Cup events and shared in a
silver medal at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta.
	   Leone marked the anniversary of that first victory with another
Sunday in the dlrs 50,000 Budweiser Grand Prix of New York at the
115th National Horse Show.
	   He should be happy it was the show's last event, given the
aftereffects of his win in 1978.
	   ``The next morning I competed in the Maclay (young riders'
national championship) and blew it out,'' he said. ``I celebrated
too much.''
	   Leone, of Greenwich, Connecticut, rode Crown Royal Legato in the
fastest of the three clean rides in the first round and was one of
two who rode clean in the jump-off.
	   The pair came in second in the Grand Prix in 1994. Leone last
won the National's Grand Prix in 1992 aboard Crown Royal Oxo.
	   U.S. Equestrian Team member Eric Hasbrouck and Miss Fio, who
keyed the USET's Nations Cup win with a faultless ride Friday, were
just over a second slower than Leone with the other clear jump-off
ride Sunday.
	   ``I wasn't afraid to go faster than that, but I just misjudged
it a little bit and was probably too conservative,'' Hasbrouck
said.
	   Third place went to independent rider Jan Tops of the
Netherlands aboard Operette La Silla, who took down two rails as
they tried to match Hasbrouck's speed.
	   Tops was satisfied with his strategy.
	   ``If I was too slow and clear, I would've been in the same
position,'' he said.
	   Hasbrouck's finish left the USET first in the team standings at
the National's end with 74 points, pushing it past a French team
that led going into the Grand Prix, even though its balky horses
got it eliminated from the Nations Cup.
	   The French, with 55 points to Canada's 30, were led by Patrice
Delaveau and Aurnella, who ended up as the show's leading rider and
horse, even though Delaveau skipped the Grand Prix.
	   The two won the dlrs 10,000 Etienne Aigner Classic on Thursday
night, the dlrs 10,000 Lexus Accumulator on Friday and the dlrs
10,000 Chopard Hit-and-Hurry on Sunday.
	   French chef d'equipe Patrick Caron said Delaveau's Grand Prix
horse, Athos du Vallot, was too edgy to show Sunday night. The
combination withdrew from the Nations Cup on Friday and Delaveau
may not use the horse in the Toronto Royal Agricultural Fair this
week.
	   ``He's a very sensitive horse and he made some big faults in the
Nations Cup. It's a big problem for the French team,'' Caron said.
	   French teammate Philippe Rozier was second in the hit-and-hurry
aboard Make My Day, the same horse he rode to victory in Saturday's
dlrs 10,000 Cosequin Gambler's Choice. Independent rider Dennis
Murphy of Vandiver, Alabama, was third on Aly Ad Libs.
	   A Canadian jet-setter got to the National in time to win the
ASPCA Maclay National Championship for junior riders.
	   Erynn Ballard, 18, of Hornby, Ontario, rode Bennington for the
prestigious horsemanship prize. She arrived in New York on Saturday
evening after competing in the first week of the Toronto show, and
was heading back for more classes in the Canadian show's second
week.
	   Second place went to Avery Dimmig, a 16-year-old from Rougemont,
North Carolina, riding a correspondingly young horse, 6-year-old
Garamount.
	   Tom D. Pettry, 17, of Richmond, Illinois, and High Expectations
won the National Horse Show Good Hands finals for young saddle-seat
riders.

As his trial continues, Anwar sharply criticizes Mahathir

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ As Anwar Ibrahim's trial entered
its second week, the ousted deputy prime minister accused Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad in an interview published Monday of being
``drunk with power.''
	   ``It's a tragedy that he is unable to see that absolute power
corrupts absolutely!'' Anwar told Time magazine. ``In his desperate
attempt to cling to power, he has no qualms about using all
instruments of government to serve his ends.''
	   Anwar was arrested Sept. 20, two weeks after he was fired by
Mahathir, setting off anti-government protests. Anwar has pleaded
innocent to 10 charges of corruption and illegal sex acts.
	   On Monday, the trial resumed after a weekend recess with a
former police intelligence chief telling the court there were
irregularities in an investigation of two people who had made
allegations against Anwar.
	   Mohamed Said Awang said the sister of Anwar's private secretary,
Ummi Hafilda Ali, had claimed that Anwar had sex with her brother's
wife. In addition, Anwar's personal driver, Azizan Abu Bakar, had
said his former boss sodomized him 15 times.
	   Anwar, who is charged with misusing his powers, asked police to
obtain retractions from the two witnesses, Mohamed testified.
Police then closed the probe, despite having found some basis for
the allegations against Anwar, Mohamed told the court.
	   Mohamed also retracted his earlier testimony that there may have
been two police reports on the investigation. A second report,
which he indicated last week had been given to Mahathir, never
existed, he said Monday.
	   When prosecution lawyers asked whether he had lied, Mohamed
replied: ``I have not lied while giving testimony in this court.''
	   A second witness, also a police officer, was called to testify
late Monday. Abdul Aziz Hussein, who arrested Ummi and Azizan, was
expected to give details of their interrogation Tuesday.
	   In the Time magazine interview, Anwar said he has lost six
kilograms (13 pounds) in jail, even though he keeps up a regimen of
jogging to stay fit and reading voraciously.
	   ``Busy with prayers, devouring books, strategizing `reformasi,'
avoiding the indolence of prison life,'' Anwar said. Reformasi, the
term he uses for his campaign of political reforms, has become the
rallying cry of protesters in Malaysia.
	   Anwar gave written answers from jail in response to questions
sent to him, Time said.
	   In the opening week of the trial, Mohamed startled the court by
testifying that police had coerced statements from arrested people
and forced some of them to retract allegations they first made.
	   Denying the charges against him, Anwar has said they were
fabricated because Mahathir considers Anwar's popularity a threat
to the prime minister's 17-year rule.
	   ``My perception of his leadership is that he is drunk with power
and he has lost all sense of rationality and sanity,'' Anwar said
in the Time interview.
	   Mahathir will be ``remembered as one who spurred economic
development and brought prosperity to the country, only to
eventually destroy it because of his megalomania,'' Anwar said.
``He has condoned abuse of power, corruption, cronyism and
nepotism.''

Bishop urges people to join Mass to mark 1991 East Timor massacre
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo, a Nobel
peace laureate, urged East Timor's people Monday to join in Masses
planned across the former Portuguese territory for those killed in
a 1991 massacre.
	   Belo also urged relatives to register family members who were
victims of the Santa Cruz massacre so the churches could pray for
their souls.
	   On Nov. 12, 1991, Indonesian troops fired on pro-independence
protesters in front of Santa Cruz cemetery. A national fact-finding
commission found at least 50 people were killed and dozens were
missing. Independent sources and rights activists put the death
toll at about 200.
	   Belo's call, made during a sermon at his residence in the East
Timor capital, came amid rumors of riots coinciding with the
seventh anniversary of the massacre Thursday.
	   The church is not organizing any demonstrations then, he said.
	   Mass for the souls of the victims is celebrated each year as a
normal tradition among Timorese and Christians, he said.
	   ``So families whose relative died in the incident can resister
their names in the local parish for the Mass before going to Santa
Cruz to lay flowers there,'' he said.
	   Maj. Gen. Adam Damiri, chief of the regional military command,
has urged East Timorese to prevent activities that could lead to
uprisings during the commemoration.
	   Source close to pro-independence activists said a march tracing
the 1991 protests was planned along a six-kilometer (3.7-mile)
route from Motael Church to Santa Cruz cemetery.
	   Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976 after intervening in a
civil war that broke out during the last days of Portuguese
colonial rule, but the United Nations still considers Portugal the
administering power.

Cautious optimism as Romania sells its telecommunications company
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The sale of Romania's national
telecommunications company to a Greek company, the biggest selloff
since communism ended, was greeted Monday with cautious optimism
after years of stalled reforms.
	   Romania has come under repeated criticism from international
lenders and investors for failing to carry out economic reforms the
government promised when it came to power two years ago.
	   After months of indecision and the withdrawal of two companies
from the sale over concerns about the future of privatization,
Romania on Saturday sold a 35 percent stake of its state
telecommunications company for dlrs 675 million to Greece's
Hellenic Telecommunications Organization SA, known as OTE.
	   While most analysts praised the deal, others said it was only a
start of reforms long delayed by bureaucracy and political feuding.
	   The U.S ambassador to Romania, James C. Rosapepe, hailed the
sale as ``a world-class decision by the Romanian government to
accelerate economic reform.'' The American telecommunication
company GTE won a contract to play a role managing Romtelecom.
	   On Friday, the international ratings company Moody's downgraded
Romania as a place for foreign business.
	   Attempting to convince the outside world Romania had not
abandoned reforms, President Emil Constantinescu said last week the
government would relaunch them to win the trust of foreign
investors. The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have
deemed the government's two years of reforms insufficient.
	   Under the contract signed Saturday, the Greek state-owned
company will invest another dlrs 400 million over the next four
years, as needed to expand its activities.
	   Since communism ended in 1989, there has been some dlrs 3.4
billion of foreign money poured into Romania, much less than in
neighboring Hungary which has less than half Romania's 23 million
population.
	   Only Italy's STET International and OTE competed for the stake
in RomTelecom. Telecommunications Minister Sorin Pantis said the
Italian company did not offer a bank guarantee or specify a sum.

Thai real estate auction deemed successful
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ An auction of real estate belonging to
56 failed finance companies fetched higher than expected prices,
even though almost 40 percent of the lots on offer failed to
attract any bids, local newspapers reported Monday.
	   The 197 lots sold at Sunday's auction brought a total of 1.54
billion baht (dlrs 42.4 million), the newspaper Business Day said.
The sum was 44.5 percent higher than the combined floor price of
1.06 billion baht (dlrs 29.2 million) for the properties, it said.
	   The combined floor price for all 319 lots on offer had been
about 3.85 billion baht (dlrs 105.5 million). The unsold lots will
be offered again at a future auction.
	   The auction was held by the Financial Sector Restructuring
Authority _ or FRA _ which was set up to oversee the liquidation of
assets after the 56 companies were shut down last year. An economic
slowdown triggered a collapse of Thailand's finance sector, when
both finance companies and banks found themselves stuck with a huge
amount of non-performing loans.
	   The next auction, to be held Dec. 2, will sell the business loan
portfolios of the suspended finance companies.
	   ``The sale of 14,139 business loans with an aggregate
outstanding principal balance of 401 billion baht (dlrs 11 billion)
... is expected to be the world's biggest ever one-day asset
sale,'' said an FRA announcement last week.
	   The highest priced property at Sunday's real estate sale, a
piece of land with a floor price of more than 1 billion baht (dlrs
27.4 million), failed to attract any bidders, Business Day
reported.
	   The most expensive single piece of property sold Sunday was the
Cathay Trust building, in a prime downtown location. The building,
which had a floor price of 170 million baht (dlrs 4.7 million),
sold for 279 million baht (dlrs 7.6 million) to a local property
company.
	   Describing the auction as very successful, FRA Assistant
Secretary-General Narong Parramasaevi was quoted by Business Day as
saying that bidding had been active and the prices realized were
50-60 percent of those obtained at the height of Thailand's early
1990s economic boom.
	   ``This indicates that the property sector is in the process of
recovering, and buyers are daring to own properties for resale,''
he was quoted as saying.
	   Previous auctions by the authority disposed of such items as
motor vehicles and art works.

Asian stock markets close generally mixed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed generally mixed
Monday, with prices tumbling in Singapore and the Philippines, but
surging in Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta.
	   In Tokyo, stocks closed mixed as investors awaited more details
of the Japanese government's latest economic stimulus measures.
	   Singapore shares slumped 5 percent on heavy profit-taking
following sharp gains in the past month. The Straits Times Index
fell 64.48 points, closing at 1,219.28.
	   Dealers said investors took profits on the belief that global
interest rates have stabilized and aren't headed any lower. The
Singapore index has gained some 45 percent in the last month.
	   Philippine share prices also tumbled on profit-taking.
	   The Philippine Stock Exchange index of 30 selected stocks fell
84.86 points, or 4.7 percent, to 1,712.51 after Friday's
35.77-point gain.
	   ``This is just a technical correction. Nothing fundamental has
changed'' in the Philippines, said Helen Alvarez, research director
at All Asia Securities.
	   Malaysian shares closed sharply higher on continued buying
support from local investors, particularly local institutional
funds.
	   The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's Composite Index, which tracks
100 key stocks, rose 2.7 percent, or 12.40 points, to 465.69.
	   Indonesian share prices also soared on bullish sentiment,
boosted by Friday's gains on Wall Street.
	   However, enthusiasm was dampened somewhat in the afternoon
session, which was filled with rumors of demonstrations ahead of
Tuesday's special parliamentary session.
	   The Jakarta Stock Exchange's Composite Index rose 10.41 points,
or 2.9 percent, to 364.393.
	   Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 72.57
points, or 0.51 percent, closing at 14,194.54. On Friday, it had
fallen 218.40 points, or 1.53 percent.
	   Share prices opened higher following gains in U.S. stocks Friday
and on expectations of more active economic rescue efforts by the
Japanese government. But the gains later ran out of steam in the
absence of new information about the measures.
	   Next Monday, the Japanese government is expected to announce a
package of public works and other measures expected to total more
than 10 trillion yen (dlrs 84 billion).
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 119.36 yen in late
afternoon, up 1.36 yen from late Friday in Tokyo and also above its
New York level of 119.10 yen Friday.
	   Elsewhere:
	   BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed sharply lower as investors
took profits. The Stock Exchange of Thailand index fell 12.75
points, or 3.3 percent, to 363.85.
	   HONG KONG: Share prices slumped on profit-taking. The Hang Seng
Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of blue chips, fell
287.82 points, or 2.8 percent, to 9,851.93.
	   SEOUL: Share prices closed higher, buoyed by renewed buying by
local individual investors. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index
rose 7.39 points, or 1.7 percent, to 424.45.
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed slightly lower on profit-taking. The
market's key Weighted Stock Price Index fell 21.32 points, or 0.3
percent, to 6,957.40.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher. The
benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 5.27 points, or 0.2 percent,
to 2,028.73.
	   SYDNEY: The Australian share market closed marginally lower. The
All Ordinaries Index fell 8.2 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,689.1.

Former U.S. hostages receive death threat
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A newspaper on Monday published a death
threat _ purportedly by an Islamic radical group _ against
Americans held hostage during the 1979 U.S. Embassy takeover if
they ever returned to Iran.
	   The hard-line Qods newspaper said the threat was delivered in a
statement phoned in by an anonymous caller who said he belonged to
Fedayeen Islam, or Volunteers for Martyrdom for Islam, which has
not been heard of for more than a decade.
	   The threat was chiefly directed against former hostages Barry
Rosen and Bruce Laingen, who have said they would be willing to
visit Iran.
	   Fedayeen was active in fighting the U.S.-backed shah's regime
during the 1960s and the period leading to the 1979 Islamic
Revolution that overthrew the shah. The group was blamed for the
1965 assassination of then-Prime Minister Hassan Ali Mansoor.
	   The Farsi-language Qods said the Fedayeen ``warned that it
considers itself duty bound to carry out suicide attacks against
Bruce Laingen and Barry Rosen and other individuals associated with
the den of spies if they return to Iran.''
	   Militant Islamic students who stormed the embassy and took 52
Americans hostage for 444 days, referred to the embassy as the
``den of spies.''
	   At a demonstration last week to mark the 19th anniversary of the
seizure, the student leaders who seized the embassy invited former
hostages to return to Iran.
	   All but about a half-dozen of the students who were once zealous
supporters of the Islamic Revolution and its leader, Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, are now considered moderates who back President
Mohammad Khatami's call for dialogue with the American people.
	   Several hold key posts in Khatami's administration.
	   But a new breed of hard-liners clustered around the supreme
leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is opposed to any compromise with
the United States. At a rally outside the former embassy last week,
the hard-liners burned effigies of Uncle Sam and called for ``death
to America.''
	   Laingen, who as charge d'affaires was the most senior diplomat
among the American hostages, said last week that he has looked
forward to returning to Iran following a new relationship between
Iran and the United States.
	   Rosen, a former press attache at the embassy who now heads the
public affairs department of Teachers College at Columbia
University, said he also would ``be in favor of going back to
Iran'' at the right time.
	   The caller who phoned in the death threat told Qods that the
group was comprised of independent ``youths and combatants who
consider it their duty to implement the dictates of Islam.''

Cautious optimism as Romania sells its telecommunications company
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The sale of Romania's national
telecommunications company to a Greek company, the biggest selloff
since communism ended, was greeted Monday with cautious optimism
after years of stalled reforms.
	   Romania has come under repeated criticism from international
lenders and investors for failing to carry out economic reforms the
government promised when it came to power two years ago.
	   After months of indecision and the withdrawal of two companies
from the sale over concerns about the future of privatization,
Romania on Saturday sold a 35 percent stake of its state
telecommunications company for dlrs 675 million to Greece's
Hellenic Telecommunications Organization SA, known as OTE.
	   While most analysts praised the deal, others said it was only a
start of reforms long delayed by bureaucracy and political feuding.
	   The U.S ambassador to Romania, James C. Rosapepe, hailed the
sale as ``a world-class decision by the Romanian government to
accelerate economic reform.'' The American telecommunication
company GTE won a contract to play a role managing Romtelecom.
	   On Friday, the international ratings company Moody's downgraded
Romania as a place for foreign business.
	   Attempting to convince the outside world Romania had not
abandoned reforms, President Emil Constantinescu said last week the
government would relaunch them to win the trust of foreign
investors. The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have
deemed the government's two years of reforms insufficient.
	   Under the contract signed Saturday, the Greek state-owned
company will invest another dlrs 400 million over the next four
years, as needed to expand its activities.
	   Since communism ended in 1989, there has been some dlrs 3.4
billion of foreign money poured into Romania, much less than in
neighboring Hungary which has less than half Romania's 23 million
population.
	   Only Italy's STET International and OTE competed for the stake
in RomTelecom. Telecommunications Minister Sorin Pantis said the
Italian company did not offer a bank guarantee or specify a sum.

Belgrade court fines independent daily
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A Belgrade court has fined the
publisher and chief editor of an independent daily the maximum 1.2
million dinars (dlrs 120,000) for breaching Serbia's restrictive
new information law, media reported Monday.
	   Following a trial held Sunday against formerly banned Dnevi
Telegraf, the court ruled that its publishing company and chief
editor would pay the steep amount for ``publishing information
inciting destruction of the constitutional order.''
	   The verdict and the trial against the newspaper, known for its
criticism of President Slobodan Milosevic's autocratic regime, came
only a day after it resumed publishing following weeks of
government bans, court trials and police raids.
	   In its first edition Saturday, Dnevni Telegraf ran an ad paid by
a Belgrade University student group that called for the abolishment
of the existing government.
	   Four students belonging to the group were arrested last week for
spraying graffiti of the group's symbol, a clenched fist, and
sentenced to ten days imprisonment.
	   Within hours of running the ad, a high-ranking Serbian official
and a close Milosevic associate sued the daily, saying it violated
Serbia's recently enacted media law.
	   The defendants and their lawyers stormed out of the Belgrade
district court Sunday after two hours of hearings, protesting the
partiality of the judge.
	   The court verdict gave the publisher 24 hours to pay the fine.
	   Dnevni Telegraf said in its Monday edition that its publisher
does not have the financial means to pay the fine and predicted
Serbian authorities would start confiscating the next day's edition
Monday night.
	   Dnevni Telegraf was first banned last month when Serbia's
government passed a decree demanding strictly ``patriotic''
coverage of events, especially the ongoing crisis in Serbia's
Kosovo province. Two other papers also were banned.
	   The decree was then superseded by a restrictive media law that
levied hefty fines on media for articles authorities deemed
anti-state.
	   Again, Dnevni Telegraf publisher was among the first fined but
refused pay. Shortly after, police raided the newspaper's Belgrade
office, hauling away equipment in partial compensation for the
money owed.
	   The paper found a loophole and resumed publishing in Montenegro,
the other republic which together with Serbia makes up the Yugoslav
federation and where the new media law does not apply.

Ukrainian miner killed

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A Ukrainian miner has died from injuries
suffered at a mine in eastern Ukraine, officials said Monday.
	   The accident occurred Saturday after a safety rules violation at
the No. 58 mine, located in the town of Sverdlovsk, 650 kilometers
(400 miles) east of Kiev, the Emergency Situations Ministry said.
	   The ministry did not give any further details.
	   More than 300 coal workers have died on the job this year in the
former Soviet republic, up from last year's total of 290.
	   With the government unable to afford new equipment because of
economic crisis and general lack of funding since the collapse of
the Soviet Union, safety conditions at the mines have been
deteriorating.

German urges quick compensation for Nazi slave workers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder was urged by a
member of his ruling coalition Monday to speed up compensation for
slave laborers forced to work under the Nazis during World War II.
	   Greens lawmaker Volker Beck keyed the appeal to German
observances of the 60th anniversary of Kristallnacht, a Nazi night
of terror against Jews less than a year before World War II began.
	   ``People are still alive who suffered in concentration camps or
were abused by the Nazis as slave workers,'' Beck said. ``Many of
them have never received adequate compensation.''
	   Slave laborers have not been eligible for back wages under
postwar German laws on reparations for victims of the Nazis.
	   Schroeder has announced he will set up a government foundation
to compensate slave laborers. Talks on funding are planned with
German companies that used slave labor during the war.
	   Also planned is a new fund to compensate victims such as
Gypsies, homosexuals and people forcibly sterilized by the Nazis.
	   ``The coalition should now start talks without delay to launch
the necessary initiatives,'' Beck said.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Cracking down on student protesters,
thousands of police and soldiers blocked activists Monday from
converging on Parliament to protest a government assembly.
	   Riot officers with sticks and shields stopped buses carrying
2,000 demonstrators, who waved red and white Indonesian flags and
yelled slogans against an assembly that will cast rules this week
for 1999 parliamentary elections.
	   Fears abound that political tension will trigger unrest similar
to the tumult that ousted former President Suharto in May after 32
years of authoritarian rule. He quit after deadly riots shook
Jakarta and student protesters occupied Parliament.
	   This time, the military has deployed 30,000 police and soldiers
in the Indonesian capital as well as warships in the city harbor.
Troops patrol the grounds of Parliament and barbed wire barricades
block some gates.
	   Violence flared on one university campus Monday when
government-backed civilian guards in trucks briefly hurled rocks
and plastic bottles at students. Police did not intervene.
	   Students also scuffled with police at a courthouse, and
white-collar workers rallied against the People's Consultative
Assembly and its patron, President B.J. Habibie. The four-day
convention opens Tuesday.
	   Many pro-democracy activists reject the 1,000-member assembly,
the nation's highest legislative body, as a haven for political
stooges from the Suharto era. It includes Parliament's 500
legislators.
	   Habibie, a onetime confidant of Suharto who critics say is
moving too slowly on reform, wants to hold parliamentary elections
next May, followed by the selection of a new head of state by a
newly designed assembly at the end of 1999.
	   Habibie, a German-trained engineer, has undone many of the rigid
controls that characterized Indonesian political life under the
77-year-old Suharto. He has freed some political prisoners and
allowed political parties and trade unions to form.
	   In the biggest protest in Jakarta, 2,000 students milled about
on a toll road two kilometers (1,2 miles) from Parliament, stymied
by phalanxes of police and navy marines blocking them. There were
huge traffic tie-ups.
	   ``For 32 years, we've been deceived by the regime. Now is the
time for the people to voice their interests,'' the protesters
chanted.
	   Other groups of students were unable to get near Parliament, and
police with sticks pushed back 70 protesters outside the Supreme
Court. One demonstrator was injured.
	   At another rally, 60 office workers, many of them wearing
neckties, shouted their disapproval of the government assembly
outside the gleaming stock exchange building.
	   In the cities of Semarang, Samarinda and Palembang, hundreds of
students rallied against the military's prominent role in politics.
The military has 75 seats allotted to it in Parliament.
	   In the city of Mataram, students demonstrated in favor of the
assembly.
	   The British Embassy warned its citizens to stay away from
Parliament this week.
	   ``There is a risk of violence, particularly if opposing groups
demonstrate at the same time,'' an embassy statement said.
	   Appealing for calm, military chief Gen. Wiranto said a peaceful
assembly would restore confidence in Indonesia and help it overcome
its economic and political problems.
	   ``The meeting is a gateway to democracy and confirms that
Indonesia is heading on a true track of reform,'' he said.
	   The convening of the assembly comes as the world's fourth most
populous nation grapples with its worst economic crisis in decades.
	   Inflation and unemployment are high, and millions of people are
sinking into poverty. Rioting and looting over price rises have
occurred sporadically for months in many areas.

Uzbekistan closed. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ Government troops chased the last
large group of rebel fighters into the mountains on Monday after
five days of fighting in the Central Asian nation.
	   The 200 rebels concentrated around the town of Aini, about 160
kilometers (100 miles) north of the capital Dushanbe, tried to flee
in small groups toward the border of Uzbekistan after suffering
heavy losses in weekend firefights with government soldiers, who
had surrounded them.
	   ``Practically all the Aini district is now under control of
government troops,'' said Tajikistan Security Minister Saidamir
Zakhurov.
	   Government officials say the rebels would not escape because the
area is surrounded, the border with Uzbekistan has been closed, and
all roads have been cut off.
	   Forty rebels were killed and 10 government soldiers wounded in
the fighting, Tajikistan presidential spokesman Zafar Saidov said
Sunday evening.
	   Though some of the rebels have been captured, the whereabouts of
their leader, former army Col. Makhmud Khudoberdyev, were unknown,
ITAR-Tass said.
	   Khudoberdyev began the uprising in northern regions of
Tajikistan on Wednesday, demanding that President Emomali Rakhmonov
free all political prisoners and bring his supporters into the
government. The president has ruled out any talks with the rebels.
	   The fighting follows a peace treaty last year that ended five
years of civil war between the Muslim opposition and Rakhmonov's
hardline government. Main opposition groups are now participating
in the government and the armed forces.
	   Still, there are many rebel leaders and warlords who ignore the
accords and wage small-scale attacks across the poor, mountainous
former Soviet republic.

Public school teachers begin indefinite strike

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ About 4,000 teachers at government-run
high schools across Lebanon walked out of classrooms Monday for an
indefinite strike to press for better pensions.
	   The strike affected 193 public schools, leaving more than 65,000
high school students without classes.
	   The teachers will be joined Tuesday by their colleagues in
junior public schools, newspapers reported Monday. This would force
about 250,000 students to stay home.
	   Those affected are only a fraction of the 1 million students in
Lebanon because private institutions and universities did not join
the strike.
	   State-run Beirut Radio said the strike was ``totally'' observed
by public schools across the country.
	   The teachers' union is demanding end-of-service compensation to
be calculated on the basis of their last full salaries. The
government proposed and the Parliament approved last month pensions
equal to 85 percent of the last income.
	   ``The strike will continue until the demands of the teachers'
union are met,'' union leader Fuad Saab told reporters Monday.
	   The government, strapped by a budget deficit and debt, has
already said it cannot afford to meet the demands.
	   Teachers' pay varies greatly depending on education and
experience. Monthly salaries run from dlrs 250 to dlrs 1,000 in
public schools and from dlrs 550 to dlrs 1,000 in private ones.

Israel to delay West Bank withdrawal despite U.S. pressure
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Despite new U.S. demands that Israel stick to
the time table of the Wye peace agreement, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said Monday he will not move forward until the
Palestinians do more to combat Islamic militants.
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, said Israel will
probably not begin its phased troop withdrawal from 13 percent of
the West Bank on Nov. 16, as stipulated by the land-for-security
accord with the Palestinians.
	   ``There will be a few days' delay, I presume,`` Bar-Illan said.
	   Israel appears to be at odds with the United States on three key
issues of the peace accord _ the time table, continued Jewish
settlement expansion and and the procedure for revoking provisions
of the PLO founding charter calling for Israel's construction.
	   In a phone call last week, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright told Netanyahu that she expected Israel to implement the
agreement on time, said U.S. Embassy spokesman Larry Schwartz.
	   ``Our understanding is that the Wye timetable will not slip,''
Schwartz told The Associated Press. ``The timetable is meant to
continue as it was signed.''
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said the agreement is ``as
good as dead'' if Israel refuses to carry out the withdrawals on
time. ``He cannot expect to have implementation of one part of the
agreement, our commitments, and postpone the other part,'' he said.
	   Concerning the PLO charter, Albright sided with the Palestinians
who say the clauses need to be changed by acclamation, but not by a
vote, the Maariv daily said.
	   Netanyahu said Monday he insisted on a vote. ``I think the most
important thing is that both sides fulfill their obligations
stipulated in the agreement,'' Netanyahu said. ``We are prepared to
fulfill our side when the Palestinians combat terrorism and when
they bring the charter for a vote.''
	   Albright also took Netanyahu to task for continued settlement
expansion, Maariv said. ``We cannot make progress this way,'' the
newspaper quoted Albright as telling Netanyahu. ``It is impossible
to view them as anything but a provocation.''
	   Since the Oct. 23 signing of the accord, settlers have set up
mobile homes on five West Bank hills in what one hard-line
politician described as a last-minute land grab.
	   ``What won't be ours, will be theirs,'' Benny Elon, a member of
the ultranationalist Moledet Party, told the Haaretz newspaper.
``It's simple. We have to grab the land.''
	   Netanyahu aides have also said that construction in the Jewish
neighborhood of Har Homa in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem would
begin in the near future.
	   Netanyahu has said the Israeli Cabinet has to ratify the
agreement before Israel can begin fulfilling its commitments.
	   In the past two weeks, Cabinet debate was postponed or broken
off four times by Netanyahu who said he needed more clarifications
from the Palestinians.
	   Last Friday, ministers dispersed in response to a suicide
bombing by the Islamic Jihad group in Jerusalem in which two
assailants were killed and 21 Israelis injured.
	   Bar-Illan said he expected to Cabinet to reconvene later this
week, though no date has been set. Israel's parliament was to
debate the accord Tuesday and Wednesday, but is postponing the
session until the Cabinet has voted on the agreement.
	   An Israeli opposition legislator, Haim Ramon, said Netanyahu
apparently was trying to hold off on a Cabinet vote until after a
key coalition partner, the National Religious Party, decides in a
convention early next week whether to stay in the government.

Philippine military prepares rescue attempt for three kidnapped

foreigners &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with rescue of a kidnapped businesswoman in Manila
suburb, grafs 12-13 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JOLO, Philippines (AP) _ Military officials are adding troops
and preparing a naval blockade to prevent a group of Muslim
extremists from escaping before an expected massive rescue attempt
for three kidnapped foreigners, a government negotiator said
Monday.
	   Munib Estino, governor of Sulu province, said the government has
given the kidnappers until Tuesday to free two Hong Kong citizens
and one Malaysian who have been held captive since Sept. 8. An
order to storm the suspected kidnappers' jungle hideout may be
given any time after Tuesday, he said.
	   Estino, one of the government's chief negotiators, said the
ultimatum was given because the talks were ``going nowhere.'' The
kidnappers are demanding dlrs 1.5 million and the government is
unwilling to pay any ransom, he said.
	   Munib said the captives, Law Cheung Yau and So Chi Ming of Hong
Kong and Tong Ket Ming of Malaysia, were buying live fish for sale
to Hong Kong restaurants when they were seized from an island in
Tawi-tawi province near the Philippine boundary with the east
Malaysian state of Sabah, about 1,040 kilometers (650 miles) south
of Manila.
	   Authorities say the kidnappers are members of the extremist Abu
Sayyaf Muslim group and disgruntled former members of the Moro
National Liberation Front, which signed a peace accord with the
government two years ago.
	   A senior officer said 500 soldiers will be added to the 1,000
soldiers already in the area to prevent the estimated 200 rebels
from escaping by land, while several naval patrol boats are
patrolling the coast to stop the kidnappers from fleeing by sea.
	   Lt. Gen. Angelo Reyes, commander of the military's Southern
Command, said the government will ``put some military pressure on
the kidnappers so they will release the victims.''
	   Reyes said an assault order is an option but ``the safety of the
foreigners is our main concern.''
	   Meanwhile, talks are continuing for the freedom of Italian
missionary priest Luciano Benedetti, who was kidnapped in Sibuco,
northwest of Zamboanga, by another suspected Muslim rebel group on
the same day the three other foreigners were seized.
	   The Moro Islamic Liberation Front, the group suspected by the
government to be involved in Benedetti's abduction, has denied any
role in the kidnapping.
	   A day later, the mother and family of a Taiwanese businessman
were also abducted in Zamboanga City.
	   In the Manila area, police arrested 14 alleged kidnappers and
killed another suspect during the rescue Monday of businesswoman
Michelle Siu Ragos in suburban Las Pinas. Ragos was kidnapped in
Valenzuela, also a Manila suburb, on Oct. 30.
	   Gen. Panfilo Lacson, chief of the Presidential Anti-Organized
Crime Task Force, said police are pursuing three other members of
the kidnap group, including its alleged leader, who fled with 4.83
million pesos (dlrs 120,750) in ransom.

Portuguese torpedo gov't plan to create administrative regions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Portuguese voters have rejected a
proposal to create administrative regional assemblies, delivering a
blow to the minority Socialist government which strongly backed the
plan while handing a political victory to rightist opposition
parties which opposed it.
	   In a referendum Sunday, more than 63 percent of voters turned
down the proposal while only 37 percent favored it, according to
official results published Monday.
	   With just 12,400 votes still to count, the abstention rate stood
at 50.8 percent among the country's 8.4 million voters.
	   Prime Minister Antonio Guterres, who billed the proposal as
``the reform of the century'' and who campaigned hard for it to be
accepted, acknowledged that the result was ``a personal political
defeat.''
	   ``But I don't think this referendum should be confused with
elections for the government or for president,'' Guterres told
reporters.
	   The main opposition party in parliament, the center-right Social
Democrat Party, said it would not use the government's defeat to
call for early general elections, which are scheduled for next
fall.
	   ``Portugal needs stability,'' Social Democrat leader Marcelo
Rebelo de Sousa said. ``Stability means a government ruling until
October 1999 and the opposition monitoring it and preparing an
alternative for next year.''
	   He added that neither would his party seek to block the passage
of the 1999 budget, due to be voted in parliament this month.
	   The Popular Party, a small rightist party which is mulling an
alliance with the Social Democrats, was more critical, insisting
the referendum outcome showed that the Socialist Party ``was not
invincible.''
	   The Socialists have won the last general, presidential,
municipal and European parliament elections, though they are four
seats short of an absolute majority in the single-chamber
parliament. Their popularity has remained high in recent opinion
polls, obtaining almost 50 percent compared with less than 40
percent for the Social Democrats.
	   The proposal, which was also backed by the opposition Communist
Party, would have created an intermediate level of government by
devolving limited administrative powers to elected assemblies in
eight regions.
	   The proposed assemblies were to be responsible for
administration, planning and development in their areas after
coordinating policy with the central government and local councils.

Strong earthquakes rock eastern Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Two strong undersea earthquakes within
eight minutes rocked parts of the eastern Indonesian province of
Maluku Monday, but there were no immediate reports of damage or
casualties, an official said.
	   The first quake, with a preliminary magnitude of 6, struck at
2:30 p.m. (0530 GMT) and was centered in the Banda Sea, 338
kilometers (211 miles) south of the city of Ambon, said Hardi, an
official of the Meteorology and Geophysics Agency.
	   A stronger one of 6.4 magnitude came within eight minutes,
centered about 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of the first, he
added.
	   ``Both the quakes were felt strongly in Ambon, but it seemed
that they caused no damage or casualties,'' Hardi said.
	   Ambon, about 2,340 kilometers (1,462 miles) east of Jakarta, is
the provincial capital of Maluku.
	   Indonesia, the world's largest archipelago nation, is prone to
seismic upheavals because of its location on the Pacific ``Ring of
Fire,'' a series of volcanoes and fault lines from North America
through Japan and Southeast Asia to the South Pacific.
	   A magnitude 6 earthquake can cause severe damage if centered in
an urban area.
	   On Sunday, a magnitude 5.5 quake struck Flores and adjacent
islands in East Nusa Tenggara province, causing panic among
residents, but there were no reports of damage or casualties.
	   In December 1992, an earthquake of magnitude 7 caused tsunami
that killed about 2,500 people in Flores, southwest of Maluku.

Georgian police arrest alleged leaders of recent revolt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Georgian police on Monday arrested two
men suspected of helping plot a one-day mutiny against President
Eduard Shevardnadze, but the alleged leader of the uprising remains
at large, a top official said.
	   The men arrested were Dzhemal Zarkua, the leader of an
opposition political movement, and Col. Genri Lolua, who had worked
at Georgia's Joint Military Academy, Internal Affairs First Deputy
Minister Teimuraz Murgulia said on state television.
	   Officials say over 40 people have been arrested for alleged
involvement in the revolt so far, including about 30 civilians, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Led by military commander Akaky Eliava, soldiers from a western
Georgian garrison mutinied Oct. 19. The soldiers returned to their
garrison but Eliava went into hiding and has not been located.
	   Eliava supported Zviad Gamsakhurdia, the man who led Georgia
when it gained independence in 1991 from the Soviet Union.
	   Gamsakhurdia was ousted in early 1992 and fought a short war in
a bid to return to power. He died under mysterious circumstances in
1994. His followers remain bitterly opposed to Shevardnadze.

Jesse Jackson touches down in Nigeria, praising changes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Jesse Jackson, President Clinton's special
presidential envoy for Africa, touched down in Nigeria on Monday
morning pledging to help the West African nation move toward
democracy.
	   ``The day is breaking on Nigeria and we are moving toward
morning,'' said Jackson, ``by February it will be the noon of
democracy.''
	   Nigeria, which has been ruled by a string of military rulers for
all but 10 years of it's 38 years of independence, has been moving
steadily toward democracy since the sudden June death of former
dictator Gen. Sani Abacha.
	   Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar has freed political prisoners, met
with foreign envoys and scheduled elections. He has repeatedly
vowed to hand power to civilian authorities following presidential
elections in February.
	   Jackson said he was moved at having flown to Nigeria on a plane
that also included some returning exiles.
	   ``The government has put in place a credible apparatus for
restoring democracy,'' he said. ``People are able to come back home
and are organizing themselves. Detained persons, including
journalists, have been freed and there is a revival of hope.''
	   Jackson, a Baptist minister and civil rights leader, will meet
with a broad spectrum of Nigeria during his two-day visit, from
religious leaders to human rights activists to politicians. He is
expected to meet Abubakar in Abuja, the capital, on Tuesday.
	   Jackson, who leaves Nigeria on Wednesday, is to return to the
United States on Nov. 14 after visits to Guinea, Sierra Leone and
Ghana.

Teen-ager receives maximum prison term for Japanese tourist's

murder &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRNS, Australia (AP) _ A youth was sentenced to life
imprisonment Monday for the murder of Japanese tourist Michiko
Okuyama in the Australian tourist city of Cairns last year.
	   The 17-year-old, whose name was suppressed by the court because
he was aged 16 at the time of the crime, stood motionless when
Justice Stanley Jones passed sentence in the Queensland state
Supreme Court in Cairns. He will be eligible for parole in 15
years.
	   Okuyama, 22, from Yokohama, was beaten to death in a Cairns
warehouse in September 1997. Her body was put into a garbage bin
and later dumped in a swamp. Police said she died from facial
fractures and blood inhalation.
	   ``There was no apparent reason for (Okuyama) to go into the
building or into the vault where she met her death,'' Jones said
during a sentencing hearing.
	   ``She was cut off from any hope of receiving help. The attack
was callous and in my view, premeditated.
	   ``I consider the act to be particularly heinous. Acts after (the
death) touch on the macabre and defy description.''
	   The murdered woman's parents, Mikio and Toshie Okuyama, who had
come to Cairns for the trial but were not here for the sentencing,
said via telephone from Japan that they were not surprised at the
sentence.
	   ``We have been waiting for this,'' they said.
	   Kevin McCreanor, lawyer for the youth, said an appeal had been
lodged against the life sentence. The youth maintained his
innocence throughout the trial.
	   Jones said the youth did not suffer from any psychiatric
disturbance and was intellectually mature.
	   ``There is nothing in your background to explain this violent
behavior,'' he told the teen-ager. ``You alone committed this
offense. You presumably are highly dangerous and unpredictable.''

began talks Monday on controlling nuclear technology in South Asia.
	   The two-days of talks will deal with export controls on nuclear
technology, officials said. The U.S. delegation travels to Pakistan
on Tuesday.
	   The meeting follows an announcement in Washington that President
Bill Clinton will lift some of the economic sanctions imposed on
India and Pakistan after they detonated nuclear devices in May.
	   The U.S. government cited progress on enlisting the support of
the two countries in nonproliferation issues.
	   The U.S. delegation, headed by Deputy Assistant Secretary of
State John Barker, was looking at the controls India has adopted to
ensure its nuclear know-how and equipment is not given to third
countries.
	   In 10 days, senior representatives from the two countries will
meet in Rome for the sixth time since the atomic tests. The U.S.
government is trying to get Indian and Pakistani signatures on the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty within the next 10 months.

Hong Kong dialysis unit where three died to remain closed

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A hospital unit where contaminated water was
pumped into the dialysis machines of six kidney patients, killing
three of them, will remain shut until improvements are made, Hong
Kong's health department said Monday.
	   ``A multitude of factors acted together to result in the
event,'' the health department said after concluding its
investigation into the incident at the private Hong Kong Sanatorium
and Hospital.
	   The dialysis unit has been closed since the fatal blunders were
made on Aug. 20. The health department said it was unable to
publicly declare what improvements are necessary, citing legal
concerns surrounding inquests into the deaths.
	   The incident was the latest in a spate of hospital accidents
over the past year, some fatal, stirring concerns over the safety
of health care in Hong Kong.

Philippine officials to meet Muslim rebels to discuss impasse
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Government negotiators will meet
Muslim rebels to try to resolve an impasse over their demand that
the government recognize certain areas in the southern Philippines
as rebel-held territories, an official said Monday.
	   In talks last week, the separatist Moro Islamic Liberation Front
demanded the immediate recognition of at least 46 MILF camps as
rebel territories to prevent accidental military encounters.
	   The government negotiators refused to immediately recognize the
rebel camps and the MILF threatened to stop peace negotiations with
the government until the demand is granted.
	   Presidential spokesman Jerry Barican said the government will
verify whether the MILF camps exist and if rebels are occupying
them, and then schedule a meeting with MILF leaders. He said the
two sides also would try to have a common definition of ``rebel
camps.''
	   Philippine officials have said that any such recognition should
adhere to the constitution.
	   Al Haj Murad, the MILF's vice chairman for military affairs,
said officials should not impose any conditions because the
government has already agreed in principle to grant such
recognition under a cease-fire accord signed last year.
	   He said the recognition would not signify rebel ownership, but
control of the lands. MILF's ownership of the lands could be
discussed when peace negotiations reach the ``formal, substantive
stage,'' Murad said.
	   The MILF is now the largest Muslim rebel group waging a war to
establish a separate Islamic state in the southern Philippines.
	   The government signed a peace accord in 1996 with the Moro
National Liberation Front, and then opened peace negotiations with
the MILF, which controls large hinterland areas in Mindanao.
	   Murad said the MILF has 13 major and 33 small camps in Mindanao.
Its headquarters, Camp Abubakar, is in Maguindanao, about 880
kilometers (550 miles) southeast of Manila.

Polish coalition votes against tax law, averting crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Averting a coalition split, parliament
rejected an income tax bill Monday that included deductions for
families and trade unions which the finance minister had said
Poland could not afford.
	   Deputies from Solidarity, the main party in the governing
coalition, on Friday had unexpectedly amended the bill to grant
deductions for families with children and making union benefits
income tax-free. Party leaders argued the deductions were in line
with the union-rooted bloc's electoral program.
	   But Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz, leader of the
market-oriented Freedom Union, the junior coalition partner, said
the deductions would cut revenues by 150 million zlotys (dlrs 44
million), which Poland could not afford.
	   As part of a compromise worked out over the weekend, coalition
deputies agreed to vote against the amended tax bill as a way of
eliminating the controversial deductions.
	   The deputies also lowered the 1999 corporate income tax to 34
percent from 36 percent. The reduction was planned already in 1996.
	   The current three income-based tax brackets _ 19 percent, 30
percent and 40 percent _ remain in force with deductions for
housing, private education and health care.
	   Balcerowicz had called for a 22 percent flat tax and elimination
of various deductions to simplify the tax system.
	   Over the weekend, the coalition agreed to present proposals of
tax changes by the end of January and to vote on a new simplified
tax system in June.

	   DHAKA , Bangladesh (AP) _ Two people were killed and more than
50 injured in clashes between political rivals on Monday, a day
after a historic trial in the 1975 killing of the nation's founder
reignited old passions.
	   A senior police officer said a young boy was killed during a
gunfight between supporters of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and
loyalists of Khaleda Zia, leader of the opposition in the
parliament. Another victim died of gunshot wounds four hours after
being admitted to Dhaka Medical College Hospital, doctors said.
	   The strike was called by an alliance of seven parties headed by
Mrs. Zia, a former prime minister, to protest the tear gassing of a
rally on Saturday that forced Mrs. Zia to flee before making a
speech. Mrs. Zia claimed police were trying to kill her.
	   Eyewitnesses said Monday's fight started after pro-government
activists ransacked and torched an opposition office, prompting
heavy retaliation. They were trying to block strikers from marching
to the residence of Dhaka mayor Mohammad Hanif to protest alleged
police brutality.
	   At least 25 people were injured in separate clashes in the
western city of Jessore _ one of 60 cities and towns affected by
the strike.
	   Earlier, riot police fired tear gas shells to scatter opposition
activists, who smashed vehicles and set off firecrackers to enforce
the strike that brought the nation's capital of nine million people
to a standstill.
	   Government offices opened, but attendance was poor, reported
United News of Bangladesh news agency. The strike halted most
traffic, and shut down stores and businesses. Banks and schools
also were closed. Some rickshaw drivers, too poor to lose a day's
income of 100 taka(dlrs 2), defied the strike and risked having
their vehicles smashed.
	   Stores close because owners fear the shops will be damaged or
looted if they defy the strike. Many people stay at home becase
there's no public transportation and private cars are often stoned.
	   Authorities deployed more than 5,000 security forces to stem the
violence.
	   The traditional political rivalry _ often violent _ was
heightened by Sunday's conviction and death sentences handed down
to the plotters of the 1975 coup in which Sheikh Mujibur Rahman,
the country's first prime minister, was assassinated.
	   Some of the coup leaders were associated with the opposition.
The current prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, is the daughter of the
assassinated leader.
	   Clashes between police and protesters were reported mainly in
downtown Dhaka, where most of the government offices are located.
	   The strike deterred more street celebrations by the governing
Awami League to welcome Sunday's conviction of 15 former military
officers involved in the coup.

20 Romanian fans arrested, several injured in soccer violence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Police sprayed tear gas and made 20
arrests after a brawl erupted between fans of Bucharest's two main
rival soccer clubs, several of whom were injured, a government
official said Monday.
	   After the match Sunday which ended 1-1, supporters of home team
Steaua soccer club flooded onto the pitch and tore Dinamo's
banners, angering some of Dinamo's 5,000 supporters.
	   Dinamo fans tried to force through a line of policemen who were
on alert for the match. A brawl ensued and dozens of fans fell and
were injured, said Col. Gheorghe Bobea of the Interior Ministry by
telephone. One person was hospitalized overnight.
	   Police used tear gas and hosed them down with water to scatter
Dinamo's supporters who destroyed 200 chairs at Steaua's stadium,
Ghencea. Dinamo will pay for the damage, Bobea said.
	   Steaua is the defense ministry's team and Dinamo belongs to the
interior ministry.
	   Some 27,000 people attended the match.
	   Rivalry between Steaua and Dinamo's supporters goes back years.
Both sides have won the Romanian championships several times.
	   Soccer violence has increased in recent years with fans clashing
on stadiums and also on the streets.

Turkish court convicts students
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ A state security court on Monday found
eight university students guilty of membership in an illegal
leftist group and sentenced them to prison terms ranging from five
to eight years.
	   Another student received a 10-month prison sentence for making
propaganda on behalf of the banned group, Revolutionary Youth,
while three others were acquitted.
	   In 1996, the students, their ages then ranging from 20 to 25,
were arrested for unfurling banners in parliament.
	   Police said they found firebombs in eight of the students homes
shortly after their arrests. The students accused police of
planting them there.
	   The case was being observed by human rights groups.
	   The defendants were originally sentenced to between three and 18
years in prison on charges of terrorism. But an appeals court
ordered a new trial in March asking for more evidence to prove that
Revolutionary Youth was a terrorist group.
	   ``We do not believe that the students received a trial by a fair
and independent court,'' said Ender Buyukculha, a lawyer for the
students. ``We are going to appeal.''
	   Some human rights groups have accused the security courts, which
hear cases deemed to concern national security, of being on the
side of prosecutors and police.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The agenda might be global, but
the menu will be Malaysian when world leaders meet next week for
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.

soto ayam, a Malaysian chicken soup, and fried rice
``village-style,'' the Star newspaper reported in Monday editions.

were expected to stay during the summit Nov. 17-18.
	   APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua

Two dead in latest violence; Others injured before holy month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Bomb explosions and a drive-by shooting
have left two people dead and others critically injured, ending a
brief respite from violence in Algeria, newspaper reports said
Monday.
	   A car bomb exploded Sunday in an attack on a highway west of
Algiers, killing the driver and critically injuring a passenger,
the newspaper Liberte reported Monday.
	   In a separate incident Sunday, an unspecified number of people
were injured when mortar fire hit the center of Blida, about 50 kms
(30 miles) south of the Algerian capital.
	   Neither attack was confirmed by Algerian authorities, the
newspaper said.
	   The recent attacks come a few weeks away from the start of the
Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which has been marked by violence in
Algeria since 1992.
	   The weekend incidents follow two attacks last week. On
Wednesday, one person was killed and another injured after a bomb
exploded at a work site at the national gas and electricity company
in Bedjaia in north central Algeria, the New Republic newspaper
reported. On the same day, a civil servant was critically injured
after armed militants shot at his car, which was also transporting
a politician from the Rally for National Democracy (RND) party, the
newspaper said.
	   There was no claim of responsibility for the attacks, but blame
is usually attributed to Islamic militants waging an insurgency
against Algeria's military-backed government.
	   An estimated 75,000 people have died in the violence which began
after authorities canceled 1992 legislative elections in which the
now banned Islamic Salvation Front was headed for victory.

EU clears Toyota's purchase of majority share in Daihatsu
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union competition regulators
gave the all-clear Monday to the purchase by Toyota Motor Corp. of
a majority stake in its affiliate, Daihatsu Motor Corp.
	   ``The overlap between the product ranges of Toyota and Daihatsu
is limited both at overall EU level and in each individual (EU)
member state,'' the European Commission said in a statement.
	   The Commission has powers to examine major mergers or alliances
between companies doing business in the 15 EU nations, even if they
involve only non-European firms.
	   In August, Toyota said it will pay about 37 billion yen (dlrs
313 million) to increase its share in Daihatsu from its existing
34.5 percent to 51.2 percent.
	   Toyota, Japan's largest automaker, said closer ties with
Daihatsu will help the companies confront intensifying global
competition and share technology in developing environment-friendly
vehicles.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Despite new U.S. demands that Israel stick to
the time table of the Wye peace agreement, Prime Minister Benjamin

	   Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, said Israel will

accord with the Palestinians.
	   ``There will be a few days' delay, I presume,`` Bar-Illan said.

U.S. investors confident of Thai economic recovery
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo BK103 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A group of high-powered U.S. investors
in Southeast Asia on Monday applauded efforts to perk up Thailand's
staggering economy, saying they had been assured by top Thai
officials that key economic reform packages will soon be approved.
	   After meetings with Thai Cabinet members, including Prime
Minister Chuan Leekpai, members of the U.S.-ASEAN Business Council
said they were confident in the future of Thailand's economy and
promised their companies would continue to invest here and
elsewhere in the region.
	   ``We would be quick as observers to applaud the aggressiveness
of the reform packages that we see being proposed in front of your
government today,'' said business council chairman George David,
who is also chairman and CEO of United Technologies Corp.
	   Thailand was hit hard by last year's Asian economic crisis, and
the proposed economic reform legislation focuses on resolving the
massive bad debt of private companies, which is hindering a
recovery.
	   ``This is very aggressive, good reform. It's very impressive,''
David said, adding that Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda
promised Parliament would pass reform measures in ``months, not
years.''
	   The U.S.-ASEAN Business Council is a private organization
comprising about 300 U.S. companies with substantial investments in
Southeast Asia. David said the five executives in the delegation
represented dlrs 300 billion in assets.
	   The council's lobbying efforts with the U.S. and Southeast Asian
governments have concentrated on removing tariffs and other
barriers to overseas trade.
	   The delegation will travel to Kuala Lumpur for the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum Nov. 14-18. David said free trade should
be a focus of discussions among the government leaders attending.
	   ``What I hope they will say at APEC is a very strong affirmation
of the free-trade agenda and a very strong affirmation of the
foreign direct investment agenda,'' he added.

Italian papers outraged at Fiorentina expulsion from UEFA Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italian sports commentators expressed outrage Monday
at the decision to kick Fiorentina out of the UEFA Cup because of
the explosion thatinjured a match official at last week's game
against the Swiss Grasshoppers.
	   Adjectives on newspapers' sports pages included ``unfair,''
``absurd'' and ``scandalous.''
	   ``UEFA says that Fiorentina is not guilty, yet still must lose
the game. Why?'' said a front-page editorial on sports daily
Corriere dello Sport. ``Can one be innocent and at the same be
punished?''
	   UEFA, European soccer's governing body, announced the ruling
Sunday.
	   The game was played on Nov. 3 in Salerno and not in Florence,
the home town of Fiorentina, and the fan who tossed the explosive
device from the stands was apparently a supporter of rival Italian
club Salernitana.
	   Commentators claimed the decision established a dangerous
precedent which might encourage fans to harm rival teams.
	   Just hours before being kicked out of the UEFA Cup Sunday,
Fiorentina had clinched the lead of the Italian Serie A.
	   ``Florence: joy and anger,'' read the front-page headline of
Gazzetta dello Sport.
	   Fiorentina has announced it will appeal the UEFA decision.

Britain: Patience with Saddam ebbing, option of force real
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DIANA ELIAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Visiting British Defense Secretary George
Robertson said on Monday that patience with Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein is ``draining away'' over his refusal to allow U.N. weapons
inspections.
	   A diplomatic solution to resolve the crisis is ``still
possible'' but the ``option of force is there, is real,'' Robertson
told reporters at the end of a day long visit.
	   Robertson said his Kuwait visit should ``give a message that
should go directly to Baghdad: do not underestimate the resolution
of the international community.''
	   ``We mean it. And the international community is united,'' he
told reporters at the Ali al-Salem air base, standing beneath the
wing of a Tornado bomber.
	   The aircraft is among the 12 GR1 Tornadoes based in Kuwait and
serviced by 400 Royal Air Force personnel. Britain also has two
frigates, HMS Grafton and HMS Cumberland, in the Gulf waters.
	   Britain and the United States have not ruled out military
strikes on Iraq to retaliate for its Oct. 31 decision to halt all
work by the United Nations Special Commission, which oversees the
dismantling of Iraq's chemical and biological weapons program and
long range missiles.
	   Baghdad says the disarmament work cannot resume until the U.N.
Security Council gives a timetable for lifting the economic
sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which had
sparked the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Robertson called the inspections crisis, Saddam's ``most serious
confrontation with the international community since the end of the
Gulf War.''
	   But ``if Saddam thinks he can drag this out he makes a serious
miscalculation,'' he said following talks with the Kuwaiti leaders.
	   ``Patience is draining away and the option of force is still
there,'' he said.
	   ``We stand resolved with Kuwait and with other countries of this
region and internationally to make sure that he (Saddam) does
comply with the demands of the international community,'' he said.
	   Robertson later left for Bahrain.

Israel to delay West Bank withdrawal despite U.S. pressure
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Despite new U.S. demands that Israel stick to
the timetable of the Wye peace agreement, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said Monday he will not move forward until the
Palestinians do more to combat Islamic militants.
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, said Israel will
probably not begin its phased troop withdrawal from 13 percent of
the West Bank on Nov. 16, as stipulated by the land-for-security
accord with the Palestinians.
	   ``There will be a few days' delay, I presume,'' Bar-Illan said.
	   Israel appears to be at odds with the United States on three key
issues of the peace accord _ the time table, continued Jewish
settlement expansion and the procedure for revoking provisions in
the PLO founding charter calling for Israel's destruction.
	   In a phone call last week, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright told Netanyahu that she expected Israel to implement the
agreement on time, said U.S. Embassy spokesman Larry Schwartz.
	   ``Our understanding is that the Wye timetable will not slip,''
Schwartz told The Associated Press. ``The timetable is meant to
continue as it was signed.''
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said the agreement is ``as
good as dead'' if Israel refuses to carry out the withdrawals on
time. ``He cannot expect to have implementation of one part of the
agreement, our commitments, and postpone the other part,'' he said.
	   Concerning the PLO charter, Albright sided with the Palestinians
who say the clauses need to be changed by acclamation, but not by a
vote, the Maariv daily said.
	   A vote by acclamation is when people in a group applaud, stomp
their feet or show another sign of support, rather than by its
members raising their hands to be counted.
	   Netanyahu said Monday he insisted on a vote. ``I think the most
important thing is that both sides fulfill their obligations
stipulated in the agreement,'' Netanyahu said. ``We are prepared to
fulfill our side when the Palestinians combat terrorism and when
they bring the charter for a vote.''
	   Albright also took Netanyahu to task for continued settlement
expansion, Maariv said. ``We cannot make progress this way,'' the
newspaper quoted Albright as telling Netanyahu. ``It is impossible
to view them as anything but a provocation.''
	   Since the Oct. 23 signing of the accord, settlers have set up
mobile homes on five West Bank hills in what one hard-line
politician described as a last-minute land grab.
	   ``What won't be ours, will be theirs,'' Benny Elon, a member of
the ultranationalist Moledet Party, told the Haaretz newspaper.
``It's simple. We have to grab the land.''
	   Netanyahu aides have also said that construction in the Jewish
neighborhood of Har Homa in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem would
begin soon.
	   Netanyahu has said the Israeli Cabinet has to ratify the
agreement before Israel can begin fulfilling its commitments.
	   In the past two weeks, cabinet debate was postponed or broken
off four times by Netanyahu who said he needed more clarifications
from the Palestinians.
	   Last Friday, ministers dispersed in response to a suicide
bombing by the Islamic Jihad group in Jerusalem in which two
assailants were killed and 21 Israelis injured.
	   Bar-Illan said he expected the cabinet to reconvene later this
week, though no date has been set. Israel's parliament was to
debate the accord Tuesday and Wednesday, but is postponing the
session until the cabinet has voted on the agreement.
	   An Israeli opposition legislator, Haim Ramon, said Netanyahu
apparently was trying to hold off on a cabinet vote until after a
key coalition partner, the National Religious Party, decides in a
convention early next week whether to stay in the government.

German minister seeks to review surveillance of ex-communists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Germany should review its surveillance of the
former East German communists after the party began governing in a
state coalition, the interior minister said Monday.
	   After the ex-communists became the Social Democrats' junior
partner in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania state last week, the
federal domestic security agency is in the ``rather awkward
situation'' of monitoring a party of government, said Otto Schily.
	   ``We need to review this,'' he said.
	   He added he would go over the information compiled on the Party
of Democratic Socialism by the agency, the Federal Office for the
Protection of the Constitution, before making a decision.
	   ``I won't be pushed,'' he said.
	   A group within the PDS, the Communist Platform, is considered
committed to the overthrow of the German state and is monitored
especially closely by the security agency.
	   The coalition in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania is the first time
the successors to the East German communists were returned to power
above the local level since unification in 1990.

Jewish memorial attacked in Germany on Kristallnacht anniversary

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ A memorial commemorating the mass deportation of
Berlin's Jews to concentration camps was found sprayed with
swastikas Monday, the 60th anniversary of the Kristallnacht pogrom.
	   Three swastikas were sprayed on the stone monument, which was
erected on a railway bridge in 1987 and has been damaged several
times since then.
	   It was not known exactly when the latest vandalism occurred,
police said.
	   Just south of Berlin in Potsdam, police reported a stone was
thrown through a window of a house on the grounds of a Jewish
cemetery early Monday.
	   Police said it was unclear whether the damage was related to the
anniversary of the Nov. 9, 1938 ``Night of Broken Glass,'' when
Nazi SA storm troopers led attacks on synagogues, Jewish businesses
and homes across Germany and Austria.

Philippines: Chinese workers building barracks on disputed reef
</HEADLINE>

Philippine-claimed reefs, grafs 12-13; presidential spokesman
saying Philippines will insist that Chinese stop activities, graf

 &UR; By JIM GOMEZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ More than 100 Chinese workers are
building large concrete barracks and possibly a pier on a disputed
South China Sea reef, Philippine Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado
said Monday.
	   He called the Chinese buildup on Mischief Reef a ``creeping
invasion'' of Philippine territorial waters and said Manila is
considering filing a complaint at the United Nations.
	   The reef, which the Philippines calls Panganiban, is in the
disputed Spratly Islands.
	   In a closed-door briefing for Philippine senators on the Chinese
actions, Mercado said he showed photographs taken from air force
reconnaissance planes revealing new concrete structures in what had
been a cluster of small huts on stilts in the reef.
	   Last week, the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs summoned
the Chinese ambassador and delivered a diplomatic note protesting
the presence of gun-bearing Chinese ships and construction
activities on the reef, 345 kilometers (215 miles) west of the
Philippine island of Palawan.
	   Philippine officials demanded that China stop the buildup and
dismantle all structures.
	   President Joseph Estrada plans to take up the issue with Chinese
President Jiang Zemin on the sidelines of a meeting of Asia-Pacific
leaders later this month in Malaysia.
	   Chinese officials say they are just repairing fishing shelters
damaged by natural causes. China said it has a sovereign right to
undertake the repairs for the safety of its fishermen.
	   Mercado, however, rejected China's explanation. ``The Chinese
are not conducting repair and renovation works. There is frenetic,
massive construction going on and they are putting up barracks.''
	   ``We believe there are cement structures that will be the
precursor of a possible pier,'' he said.
	   A Philippine military official based on Palawan said they also
have sighted a wide platform that could be turned into a helicopter
landing pad. He said Chinese frigates and ships, carrying
construction materials, have frequented the area in recent weeks.
	   A defense official said the Philippine military has recently
monitored at least two other Chinese cargo ships with construction
materials heading for other reefs claimed by the Philippines in the
Spratlys.
	   The official said the military was monitoring the cargo ships.
	   Mercado said China's actions in the reef violated the United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Seas, which gives countries
the exclusive right to exploit resources in the sea 200 miles from
their shores.
	   Presidential spokesman Jerry Barican said the Philippines would
continue talks with Chinese officials to urge them to immediately
stop the activities.
	   Tensions over Mischief Reef first flared in 1995 when the
Philippines spotted concrete structures built by China. Disputes
over the reef and other areas in the Spratlys have since
periodically upset relations.
	   The Spratlys are believed to lie atop valuable mineral and gas
deposits. But claims over all or part of the chain by six
governments _ China, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and
Vietnam _ have prevented thorough exploration.

Barak in Jordan to discuss Mideast peacemaking
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Israeli opposition leader Ehud Barak on
Monday discussed with Crown Prince Hassan the delay in implementing
the latest peace accords between Israel and the Palestinians.
	   Ehud Barak's visit _ the second since July 14 _ comes one day
after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu indefinitely
postponed a Cabinet debate on the ratification of the Wye River
memorandum following Friday's bomb attack in west Jerusalem.
	   The Wye deal signed at a White House ceremony on Oct. 23 calls
on Israel to cede more West Bank lands to the Palestinians in
return for security guarantees.
	   Barak, the head of Israel's left-leaning Labor Party, is
accompanied by party members, Eitan Kabel and Yossi Katz. All three
are members are Israeli Parliament.
	   Barak briefed Hassan on his party's stand on the Wye deal,
officials said in exchange for anonymity. They declined to provide
other details.
	   Hassan is King Hussein's brother who is acting as regent while
the king is receiving cancer treatment in the United States. Both
Hussein and Hassan have hosted several Israeli political groups to
articulate Jordan's peace perspective to the Israeli public
opinion.
	   Information Minister Nasser Judeh told reporters that Barak's
visit is ``part of the continued dialogue between the government of
Jordan and the body politic in Israel out of concern for national
Arab interests.''
	   Jordan, which signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, is also
actively engaged in persuading Israel's right wing-led government
to reach a settlement with the Palestinians. King Hussein was
instrumental in brokering the Wye deal.
	   Jordan is eager for a swift settlement to the Palestinian
conflict to ease opposition among its predominantly Palestinian
population to its own peace treaty with Israel.
	   Barak was expected to return home later in the day.

Estonia indicts man for Stalin-era deportations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TALLINN, Estonia (AP) - Estonian prosecutors have indicted a
former official of the Soviet secret police for his alleged role in
deporting hundreds of Estonians during the Stalinist era, the
Baltic News Service reported Monday.
	   Mikhail Neverovsky, 78, is accused of ordering the deportation
of 278 Estonians in 1949 when he was a top official of the NKVD, a
predecessor of the KGB, the report said.
	   He is charged with crimes against humanity, which carries a
maximum penalty of life imprisonment.
	   The report did not say whether Neverovsky was in police custody.
	   After the Soviet Union occupied Estonia during World War II,
tens of thousands of Estonians were deported by Soviet forces. Most
were shipped to Siberia, where many died in harsh the harsh
conditions.
	   Charges related to Stalinist-era crimes are also pending against
Vasily Bleskov, 80, and Vladimir Loginov, 73. The trial of
77-year-old Johannes Klaassepp, also accused in taking part in
deportations, began in May.

Vietnamese prime minister issues new detention regulations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van Khai
has issued a new regulation on temporary custody in an effort to
reduce illegal arrests and detention, a Government Office official
said Monday.
	   People who have been illegally arrested or detained now will
have the right to complain or petition.
	   A government report to the current National Assembly session
said nearly 30 percent of people who are arrested or detained are
not charged and only face administrative fines.
	   The regulation, signed Saturday and effective in 15 days, allows
each district police or provincial military command to have a
detention section, while provincial police, the Defense Ministry
and the Police Ministry can have one or two detention facilities,
the official said.
	   The old regulation, dating to 1992, did not mention how many
detention sections or facilities each organization could have.
	   The new ordinance also includes the monthly food ration that was
listed in an inter-ministerial circular: 15 kilograms (33 pounds)
of rice, 0.3 kilograms (11 ounces) of meat, 0.5 kilograms (1.1
pounds) of fish, 0.8 kilograms (1.8 pounds) of salt, 0.5 liters (17
ounces) of fish sauce and 15 kilograms (33 pounds) of vegetables.

Israel acknowledge Lebanese top soil taken
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ After initial denials, Israel confirmed Monday
that Israelis have been stealing top soil from southern Lebanon and
carting it off to Israel.
	   A Foreign Ministry statement did not make it clear whether those
involved were Israeli soldiers. South Lebanon is off-limits to
Israeli civilians, and the ministry said the Israeli army, as well
as the police, were looking into the matter.
	   Ministry spokesman Aviv Shiron said a first investigation showed
that soil was taken from an area near the border for private
purposes. Shiron said the ministry has not yet contacted the
Lebanese government and would not do so until it has completed its
investigation.
	   Last month, Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri wrote to the
United Nations and the Arab League, asking them to prevent Israel
from taking the top soil. Berri said in his letter that Israel was
``systematically scooping hundreds of tons of soil.''
	   The soil in southern Lebanon is said to be richer than northern
Israel's because the farmlands of south Lebanon are not cultivated
as much as a result of the conflict between Israeli and guerrilla
forces. Israeli troops and an allied militia occupy a strip of
south Lebanon as a buffer against guerrilla attacks.
	   Lebanon has in the past accused Israel of stealing its water and
using south Lebanon to test missiles.
	   Israel initially denied the soil was being taken. Uri Lubrani,
the Israeli coordinator for activities in Lebanon, dismissed the
first reports as ``nonsense,'' according to the Haaretz daily.
	   Timor Goksel, spokesman for the U.N. peacekeeping force in
southern Lebanon, said it was inconceivable that Israeli troops
stationed in the area did not know about the soil theft.

U.S. trains Asian narcotics police in Laos
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Officials from the United States and 11
Asian countries met Monday in the Laotian capital, Vientiane, to
begin a two-week seminar aimed at improving Asian police forces'
techniques for investigating drug trafficking.
	   The event, organized by the U.S. and Laotian governments, is
being attended by law enforcement officers from Thailand, Hong
Kong, the Philippines, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei,
Singapore, Vietnam and Japan as well as the host country, said a
faxed statement from the U.S. Embassy in Vientiane.
	   Instructors from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration will
train their Asian counterparts in initiating, developing and
concluding a wide range of drug-related investigations during the
seminar, the statement said.
	   The seminar is being held in Vientiane to emphasize the
increasingly important role played by the Laotian government in the
fight against drug trafficking, it said.
	   Laos has undertaken a 10-year, dlrs 81 million program to reduce
the illicit production of opium, from which the narcotic drug
heroin is derived. Much of the world's heroin supply comes from the
notorious ``Golden Triangle,'' the area where the borders of
Thailand, Myanmar and Laos meet.
	   The Laotian government recently said surveys showed opium
production in 1997 amounted to about 126 tons, down from the 140
tons produced the previous year.

Ethnic violence tears at poor but oil-rich Niger River delta
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos NY108-111 &QL; 
 &UR; By MYLES TIERNEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARRI, Nigeria (AP) _ Violence haunts the sinuous waterways that
snake through the Niger River delta, and violence lurks in its lush
mangrove swamps.
	   Ethnic animosities and fights over ownership of oil-rich lands
have the region in upheaval, its hospitals filled with the wounded,
its cemeteries with the dead.
	   Almost a third of Nigeria's crude oil output _ the country's
biggest industry _ has been blocked because ethnic Ijaw militants
have seized pumping stations and communication posts in the delta
belonging to Western oil giants like Shell and Chevron.
	   Most recently, ethnic rage boiled over in Warri, a delta town
often near the epicenter of the violence. Two weeks ago, dozens of
Ijaw youths burned houses and shops belonging to ethnic Itsekiris
in retaliation for similar attacks a few weeks earlier.
	   The Itsekiri claim ownership of most oil-producing land around
Warri, a claim disputed by both the Ijaw and by the largest ethnic
group near the town, the Urhobo.
	   Many area residents have left recently, fearing worsening
violence.
	   Ijaws and Itsekiris blame each other _ and the government _ for
the attacks.
	   ``The Nigerian government has launched a systematic attack
(against) my people,'' said Bello B. Orubebe, a lawyer and Ijaw
activist.
	   He says many Ijaws have been attacked for no reason by army
patrols.
	   The army contends that its troops fight only ethnic militias
that have been attacking oil installations.
	   Local hospitals are full of young men with bullet, grenade or
shrapnel wounds, and doctors say the load is difficult to cope with
in their ill-equipped clinics.
	   ``We don't have enough facilities,'' said Uwomano Onyoh, a human
rights activist. ``And water _ we don't have running water; we rely
on river water.''
	   He said hospitals also have chronic shortages of antibiotics and
even beds.
	   Despite the debate over land ownership, neither the Ijaws nor
Itsekiris control the region's oil wealth. The government does.
	   And the shortages plaguing the hospitals affect nearly everyone.
The people of the delta are deeply poor, many living without
electricity, clean water, paved roads or schools.
	   Reflecting the desperation, at least 700 people died in the
nearby town of Jesse last month when a leaking gasoline pipeline
exploded into flames while hundreds of people were scooping up
spilled fuel.
	   The few roads, schools and clinics in the region largely come
from the oil companies, because the national government does
little.
	   The Nigerian government, while rich in oil, has been crippled by
years of corruption and incompetence. The country, which produces 2
million barrels of oil a day, cannot even refine enough gasoline
for its own use.
	   With the government largely staying out of the region _ except
when it comes to putting down violence _ the oil companies are the
only targets left for angry youths. They attack oil installations
and hold employees hostage to demand more services or reportedly
payoffs.
	   During the recent violence in Warri, young Itsekiris overran the
town's port, where they took 60 oil workers hostage, then screened
them to make sure none were Ijaw before releasing them.
	   The port remains closed, hampering oil exports from the region.
	   All the ethnic groups say they can prove their claims to land
ownership with documents and colonial treaties, claims they will
eventually argue to Nigeria's supreme court. In the meantime,
displaced Itsekiris stream into Warri from outlying areas to escape
violence.
	   Tribal elders and chiefs are having an increasingly difficult
job containing the anger. Young militants no longer trust elders
they feel have been bought off by the government and foreign oil
companies.
	   ``We have been doing our best to contain _ to try to contain _
our youths ... but we are now finding it extremely difficult,''
said B.O. Okumagba, a Urhobo traditional leader. ``So we see
ourselves as sitting on a keg of gunpowder. If it explodes, what is
happening now could be child's play.''

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Police arrested two Taiwanese men and
seized more than 6 million pesos (dlrs 150,000) worth of illegal
drugs in a sting operation in the parking lot of a Manila hotel,
officials said Monday.
	   Police said Yu Yuk Lai and William Sy, both from Taiwan, were
arrested Saturday after receiving 1.5 million pesos (dlrs 37,500)
worth of casino playing chips from a police agent as partial
payment for three kilograms (6.6 pounds) of methamphetamine
hydrochloride.
	   Yu is believed to be the No. 2 leader of the Taiwanese-based
14-K Gang in the Philippines, police said.
	   The two Taiwanese tried to buy their way out of the arrest by
offering police dlrs 20,000, 1.9 million pesos (dlrs 47,500) and
their car, police said. Aside from drug charges, the two also face
bribery charges.
	   People convicted of selling more than 200 grams (0.44 pounds) of
methamphetamine hydrochloride are subject to the death penalty in
the Philippines.

Filipino children to be taught what to do during La Nina-induced

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Filipino children will be taught in
school about the La Nina weather phenomenon so they will know what
to do during severe storms, the education department said Monday.
	   Education Secretary Andrew Gonzalez said a memorandum has been
issued ordering teachers to incorporate La Nina information into
subjects being taught to minimize its effect on children.
	   Gonzalez said the order also encourages teachers, parents and
school organizations to discuss La Nina preparations and form
disaster volunteer groups.
	   Sally Santiago, a senior education specialist for the
department, said children will be taught basic first aid as well
what to do when one's home is damaged in a storm.
	   Children will also be taught how to contact officials and will
be given maps of where evacuation centers are located. Films of
actual floods will also be shown, she said.
	   Recent strong typhoons that killed at least 370 people and
caused millions of dollars of crop and property damage are an
indication that La Nina is already affecting the country, weather
forecasters say.
	   La Nina, attributed to an abnormal cooling of the sea surface,
is expected to cause heavy rains for the rest of the year. It
follows a long drought attributed to the opposite weather
phenomenon, El Nino, caused by higher temperatures in the Pacific
Ocean.
	   The weather bureau expects La Nina will intensify the effects of
at least five more tropical storms expected to strike the country
in coming months. Provinces on the east side of Luzon, the
Philippines' main island, will feel the brunt of the storms,
weather officials say.

Criminal probes under way for apartheid abuses
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With JOH101 &QL; 
 &UR; By DANIEL J. WAKIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, two
former security force generals and others named in the recent Truth
Commission report on apartheid-era abuses are under criminal
investigation, a prosecutor said Monday.
	   Statements by the prosecutor, Jan d'Oliveira, were the clearest
signal yet that criminal cases would be brought against figures
implicated by the commission in gross human rights violations.
	   The panel released its five-volume report, the result of more
than 2 1-2 years of hearings, on Oct. 30. It chronicles the human
rights abuses committed by apartheid governments and their
operatives as well as by the African National Congress and others
fighting the racist system.
	   The commission has the ability to grant amnesty to those who
admit their misdeeds and are found to have acted with political
motives. The report said individuals who have not sought amnesty
should be prosecuted.
	   Such prosecutions could last up to six years, said d'Oliveira,
who is prosecutor for Gauteng, the province of Johannesburg and the
capital Pretoria. He said ANC figures were among targets of the
investigations.
	   The issue of continuing prosecutions is significant. Many feel
that dragging on criminal reckonings of the horrors of the
apartheid era will only prolong bitterness and delay
reconciliation. But supporters of prosecution feel that denying
justice to the victims is a worse evil.
	   On a practical level, highly public prosecutions of ANC figures
could have an impact on national elections next year, when the
party will seek to consolidate its hold on power.
	   Madikizela-Mandela has not sought amnesty. The commission found
her accountable for human rights violations committed by her
bodyguards, who the report said killed and tortured suspected
opponents.
	   Madikizela-Mandela was convicted in 1991 of kidnapping and being
an accessory to an assault on four young men. She was sentenced to
six years in jail, but paid a dlrs 3,200 fine on appeal.
	   The case and testimony about her activities before the Truth
Commission was marked by retractions and conflicting words by
witnesses.
	   ``We have good reasons to prepare a prosecution (of
Madikizela-Mandela) except for those imponderables, at the
moment,'' the prosecutor told reporters in Pretoria. He said the
probe was half completed, and did not specify what the accusations
were.
	   Madikizela-Mandela, President Nelson Mandela's former wife, is
an ANC official and among the most prominent anti-apartheid
activists.
	   In other cases, including one of the two unnamed generals,
prosecutors were ready to move forward pending decisions on amnesty
applications. The commissioners hope to wrap up their amnesty work
by mid-1999.
	   He said investigators would look carefully at the commission's
evidence, and would focus on killings.
	   ``Is there, on the evidence, a reasonable prospect of success of
conviction? If there is not, we will not prosecute,'' he said.

British Airways earnings rise 14.3 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British Airways PLC reported Monday that its
third-quarter profits rose 14.3 percent compared to last year,
which the company credited to effective cost-cutting measures in
the face of a weakening economy.
	   British Airways recorded pretax profits of 240 million pounds
(dlrs 398.4 million), or 19.1 pence per share, in the three months
ending Sept. 30. The company earned 210 million pounds (dlrs 348.6
million), or 13.9 pence per share, in the same period a year
earlier.
	   However, pretax profits for the six months ending Sept. 30 were
off 10.5 percent. The company earned 385 million (dlrs 639 million)
for the period, compared to 430 million pounds (dlrs 713.8 million)
during the same period last year.
	   Third-quarter revenues rose 8.7 percent to 2.44 billion pounds
(dlrs 4.05 billion) from 2.24 billion pounds (dlrs 3.72 billion)
last year.
	   ``Today's results show how the company has benefited from its
clear understanding of the key trends in the international airline
market,'' BA's chairman, Lord Marshall, said in a statement.
``Despite current global economic uncertainties, we are taking the
necessary steps to ensure that we are in a flexible position to
meet further challenges.''

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ After two hours of talks with his top security
advisers, President Bill Clinton has put off a decision on whether
to use force against Iraq to reopen weapons sites to U.N.
inspectors. During the talks at the presidential retreat at Camp
David, Clinton reviewed diplomatic and military options and then

spokesman at the National Security Council. Leavy and other
administration officials described the situation as ``very
serious.'' Among the considerations was that Iraq might respond to
an attack by permanently banning the international search for
illegal chemical and biological weapons. Iraq announced last month
that it was halting cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors until
the Security Council begins moving to lift crippling trade
sanctions, which were imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
The Security Council has said the embargo won't be lifted until
U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of
mass destruction. (US-IRAQ)
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ In a desperate race against time,
relief agencies trying to feed tens of thousands isolated by
Hurricane Mitch struggled to deliver tons of food, despite ruptured
roads, backed-up airports and too few helicopters. Hunger and
disease threaten to raise the death toll from Mitch, which Central
American officials estimate has killed more than 10,000 in the
region. If confirmed, that would make Mitch among the five worst
hurricanes ever recorded in the Caribbean. ``The Honduran Red Cross
is giving out all they have. Everything incoming is absolutely
necessary,'' American Red Cross spokeswoman Ann Stingle said on
Sunday. On Sunday, the first shipments of aid reached many hamlets
and cities cut off by flooding, such as Choluteca in southern
Honduras and Posoltega, Nicaragua, where an estimated 2,000 people
were killed in a mudslide. (MITCH)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Despite new U.S. demands that Israel stick to
the timetable of the Wye peace agreement, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said Monday he will not move forward until the
Palestinians do more to combat Islamic militants. Netanyahu's
senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, said Israel will probably not
begin its phased troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank
on Nov. 16, as stipulated by the land-for-security accord with the
Palestinians. ``There will be a few days' delay, I presume,''
Bar-Illan said. Israel appears to be at odds with the United States
on three key issues of the peace accord _ the timetable, continued
Jewish settlement expansion and the procedure for revoking
provisions in the PLO founding charter calling for Israel's
destruction. In a phone call last week, U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright told Netanyahu that she expected Israel to
implement the agreement on time, said U.S. Embassy spokesman Larry
Schwartz. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ In a major blow to the traditional
parties that have ruled Venezuela for decades, a left-wing
coalition led by failed coup leader Hugo Chavez became the leading
force Sunday in the Venezuelan Congress, initial election results
showed. With 67 percent of the vote counted, Chavez's Patriotic
Pole coalition won 34 percent of the congressional seats, giving it
the single largest share. The center-left Democratic Action Party,
one of two traditional parties that dominate the current Congress,
won about 22 percent. The other one, the conservative Copei Party,
won 11 percent. The 44-year-old Chavez, supported by millions of
peasants and shantytown dwellers, is also the front-runner to win
the Dec. 6 presidential election. In 1992, he staged an
unsuccessful military revolt against Venezuela's democratically
elected government. Many people blame Copei and Democratic Action
for the country's declining living standards and for squandering
Venezuela's vast oil wealth. (VENEZUELA-ELECTIONS)
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, two
former security force generals and others named in the recent Truth
Commission report on apartheid-era abuses are under criminal
investigation, a prosecutor said Monday. Statements by the
prosecutor, Jan d'Oliveira, were the clearest signal yet that
criminal cases would be brought against figures implicated by the
commission in gross human rights violations. The panel released its
five-volume report, the result of more than 2 1/2 years of
hearings, on Oct. 30. It chronicles the human rights abuses
committed by apartheid governments and their operatives as well as
by the African National Congress and others fighting the racist
system. The commission has the ability to grant amnesty to those
who admit their misdeeds and are found to have acted with political
motives. The report said individuals who have not sought amnesty
should be prosecuted. (SOUTH AFRICA-RIGHTS PROSECUTIONS)

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed generally mixed
Monday, with prices tumbling in Singapore and the Philippines, but
surging in Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta. Singapore shares slumped 5
percent on heavy profit-taking following sharp gains in the past
month. The Straits Times Index fell 64.48 points, closing at
1,219.28. Dealers said investors took profits on the belief that
global interest rates have stabilized and aren't headed any lower.
Philippine share prices also tumbled on profit-taking. The
Philippine Stock Exchange index of 30 selected stocks fell 84.86
points, or 4.7 percent, to 1,712.51 after Friday's 35.77-point
gain. Malaysian shares closed sharply higher, with the main Index
rising 2.7 percent, or 12.40 points, to 465.69. Indonesian share
prices also soared on bullish sentiment, up 10.41 points, or 2.9
percent, to 364.393. In Tokyo, stocks closed mixed as investors
awaited more details of the Japanese government's latest economic
stimulus measures. Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
gained 72.57 points, or 0.51 percent, closing at 14,194.54. In
currency trading, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 119.36 yen in late
afternoon, up 1.36 yen from late Friday in Tokyo. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Asian-Pacific nations should
include human rights on the agenda when meet this month in Malaysia
to discuss economic recovery, Amnesty International said Monday.
``People who are suffering the effects of the economic downturn
have a right to be heard and to organize themselves to protect
their livelihoods,'' the London-based human rights group said in a
statement. Economic reforms ``cannot be dealt with in isolation
from recognition and respect for fundamental human rights, such as
freedom of expression and association,'' the group said. The call
for greater focus on human rights comes as Malaysia _ the host for
this year's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum _ faces
international criticism for its handling of top dissident Anwar
Ibrahim. Anwar was arrested Sept. 20, two weeks after he was fired
by Mahathir, setting off antigovernment protests. Anwar has pleaded
innocent to 10 charges of corruption and illegal sex acts, and his
trial entered it second week Monday. (MALAYSIA-APEC-AMNESTY)
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder was urged by a
member of his ruling coalition Monday to speed up compensation for
slave laborers forced to work under the Nazis during World War II.
Greens lawmaker Volker Beck keyed the appeal to German observance
of the 60th anniversary of Kristallnacht, a Nazi night of terror
against Jews less than a year before World War II began. Slave
laborers have not been eligible for back wages under postwar German
laws on reparations for victims of the Nazis. Schroeder has
announced he will set up a government foundation to compensate
slave laborers. Talks on funding are planned with German companies
that used slave labor during the war. Also planned is a new fund to
compensate victims such as Gypsies, homosexuals and people forcibly
sterilized by the Nazis. (GERMANY-SLAVE WORKERS)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesian police plan to file banking
fraud charges against the owners and executives of 13 insolvent
banks closed down by the government last November, a report said
Monday. ``We expect the dossiers of the 13 liquidated banks to be
completed in two months' time,'' Col. Made Mangku Pastika said, as
quoted by the Jakarta Post newspaper. Made said the results of the
police investigations into two of the banks would be submitted to
prosecutors this week, but he wouldn't reveal the names of the
banks. The 13 banks were among 16 closed by the government last
November for exceeding the legal lending limit. The closures were
the government's first step to clean up the nation's beleaguered
banking industry. Reform of the banking system is seen as crucial
to Indonesia's attempts to recover from its worst economic crisis
in 30 years. (INDONESIA-BANK FRAUD)
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder suggested in a
weekend interview that Germans be eased into earlier retirement as
a way to open up jobs and fight double-digit unemployment. A top
business lobby rejected the plan as too expensive. Schroeder told
the weekly Bild am Sonntag he would propose that labor and business
agree to let workers retire with full benefits at 60, five years
earlier than usual. The two sides could set up new funds to finance
the increased costs, he said. Schroeder, elected in September on a
pledge to combat 10-percent unemployment, is gearing up for
roundtable talks on job creation with business and labor due to
start next month. Lowering the retirement age would be a priority,
along with a previously announced plan to find jobs for 100,000
young jobless, he said. But Dieter Hundt, head of the powerful
German Association of Employers, called the retirement plan
``unaffordable'' and ``an inept attempt to redistribute work.'' If
people retire early, they must accept a cut in the
government-mandated benefits, he told the Allgemeine Zeitung in
Mainz. (GERMANY-UNEMPLOYMENT)

Pope gives money to Vatican workers to mark 20th anniversary
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ After several celebrations for his 20th
anniversary as pontiff, Pope John Paul II is marking the occasion
with gifts of 1 million lire (dlrs 600) for each Vatican employee.
	   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro Valls said Monday that the
pope also asked that a ``fitting sum'' of money go to retired Holy
See workers, but the exact amount wasn't mentioned.
	   There are about 4,000 Vatican employees, including lay workers
and clergy. The Vatican didn't say which fund the money would come
from.

Yeltsin rests in country house, prepares to meet Japanese leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix garble

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin, who has returned from a
week-long vacation on the Black Sea coast, spent a national holiday
on Monday resting at a country residence outside the capital, his
office said.
	   Yeltsin has been working only sporadically in recent months and
has made few public appearances, prompting speculation about the
state of his health.
	   The president was ``in good health and in a good mood'' when he
came back to the Moscow area on Sunday following his vacation in
the southern Russian resort of Sochi, presidential spokesman Dmitry
Yakushin told the ITAR-Tass news agency. The president was
recovering from fatigue and high blood pressure, his office said.
	   Yakushin did not say why the president had come home early from
the vacation, but stressed that Yeltsin's plans to host a number of
foreign leaders in November had not changed.
	   Yeltsin will meet Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi on
Thursday, and will greet German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder,
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro of Italy and Queen Beatrix of the
Netherlands later in the month.
	   The 67-year-old Yeltsin has handed over many day-to-day
responsibilities to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, receding into
the background with vacations and periodic stops at government rest
homes.
	   Yeltsin's doctors say he is suffering nothing more serious than
exhaustion, and his previous health problems in the last few months
have been bad colds. Opposition leaders are demanding a detailed
diagnosis of the president's heath, but there is little chance
Yeltsin will cede such a request.
	   Monday was a holiday marking the 81st anniversary of the 1917
Russian revolution. The anniversary actually fell on Saturday, but
Monday was an official day off in Russia.

Italian papers outraged at Fiorentina expulsion from UEFA Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: SUBS last graf to ADD team hoping appeal would lead to
replaying of game &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italian sports commentators expressed outrage Monday
at the decision to kick Fiorentina out of the UEFA Cup because of
the explosion that injured a match official at last week's game
against the Swiss Grasshoppers.
	   Adjectives on newspapers' sports pages included ``unfair,''
``absurd'' and ``scandalous.''
	   ``UEFA says that Fiorentina is not guilty, yet still must lose
the game. Why?'' said a front-page editorial on sports daily
Corriere dello Sport. ``Can one be innocent and at the same be
punished?''
	   UEFA, European soccer's governing body, announced the ruling
Sunday.
	   The game was played on Nov. 3 in Salerno and not in Florence,
the home town of Fiorentina, and the fan who tossed the explosive
device from the stands was apparently a supporter of rival Italian
club Salernitana.
	   Commentators claimed the decision established a dangerous
precedent which might encourage fans to harm rival teams.
	   Just hours before being kicked out of the UEFA Cup Sunday,
Fiorentina had clinched the lead of the Italian Serie A.
	   ``Florence: joy and anger,'' read the front-page headline of
Gazzetta dello Sport.
	   Fiorentina will appeal the decision in hopes of replaying the
game, manager Luciano Luna told Gazzetta dello Sport.

Portuguese torpedo gov't plan to create administrative regions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES figures in 2nd and 3rd grafs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Portuguese voters have rejected a
proposal to create administrative regional assemblies, delivering a
blow to the minority Socialist government which strongly backed the
plan while handing a political victory to rightist opposition
parties which opposed it.
	   In a referendum Sunday, 63.49 percent of voters turned down the
proposal while 36.51 percent favored it, according to official
results published Monday.
	   With just 12,400 votes still to count, the abstention rate stood
at 51.72 percent among the country's 8.4 million voters.
	   Prime Minister Antonio Guterres, who billed the proposal as
``the reform of the century'' and who campaigned hard for it to be
accepted, acknowledged that the result was ``a personal political
defeat.''
	   ``But I don't think this referendum should be confused with
elections for the government or for president,'' Guterres told
reporters.
	   The main opposition party in parliament, the center-right Social
Democrat Party, said it would not use the government's defeat to
call for early general elections, which are scheduled for next
fall.
	   ``Portugal needs stability,'' Social Democrat leader Marcelo
Rebelo de Sousa said. ``Stability means a government ruling until
October 1999 and the opposition monitoring it and preparing an
alternative for next year.''
	   He added that neither would his party seek to block the passage
of the 1999 budget, due to be voted in parliament this month.
	   The Popular Party, a small rightist party which is mulling an
alliance with the Social Democrats, was more critical, insisting
the referendum outcome showed that the Socialist Party ``was not
invincible.''
	   The Socialists have won the last general, presidential,
municipal and European parliament elections, though they are four
seats short of an absolute majority in the single-chamber
parliament. Their popularity has remained high in recent opinion
polls, obtaining almost 50 percent compared with less than 40
percent for the Social Democrats.
	   The proposal, which was also backed by the opposition Communist
Party, would have created an intermediate level of government by
devolving limited administrative powers to elected assemblies in
eight regions.
	   The proposed assemblies were to be responsible for
administration, planning and development in their areas after
coordinating policy with the central government and local councils.

Lightning kills nine in eastern Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A lightning bolt killed at least nine
people in the eastern Indonesian province of East Nusa Tenggara,
the official Antara news agency reported Monday.
	   The nine were volleyball players who had taken shelter at a
house during a heavy rain last Thursday in the district of Kuwus on
Flores Island, 1,400 kilometers (875 miles) east of Jakarta, Antara
said.
	   Three other players took refugee at another house, Antara said
in a late report from the provincial capital of Kupang, about 1,875
kilometers (1,172 miles) southeast of the Indonesian capital.
	   It said it was the second deadly lightning strike in the
district in recent days. One villager was killed earlier.

Belgrade court fines independent daily
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING for all needing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A Belgrade court has fined the
publisher and chief editor of an independent daily the maximum 1.2
million dinars (dlrs 120,000) for breaching Serbia's restrictive
new information law, media reported Monday.
	   Following a trial held Sunday against formerly banned Dnevi
Telegraf, the court ruled that its publishing company and chief
editor would pay the steep amount for ``publishing information
inciting destruction of the constitutional order.''
	   The verdict and the trial against the newspaper, known for its
criticism of President Slobodan Milosevic's autocratic regime, came
only a day after it resumed publishing following weeks of
government bans, court trials and police raids.
	   In its first edition Saturday, Dnevni Telegraf ran an ad paid by
a Belgrade University student group that called for the abolishment
of the existing government.
	   Four students belonging to the group were arrested last week for
spraying graffiti of the group's symbol, a clenched fist, and
sentenced to ten days imprisonment.
	   Within hours of running the ad, a high-ranking Serbian official
and a close Milosevic associate sued the daily, saying it violated
Serbia's recently enacted media law.
	   The defendants and their lawyers stormed out of the Belgrade
district court Sunday after two hours of hearings, protesting the
partiality of the judge.
	   The court verdict gave the publisher 24 hours to pay the fine.
	   Dnevni Telegraf said in its Monday edition that its publisher
does not have the financial means to pay the fine and predicted
Serbian authorities would start confiscating the next day's edition
Monday night.
	   Dnevni Telegraf was first banned last month when Serbia's
government passed a decree demanding strictly ``patriotic''
coverage of events, especially the ongoing crisis in Serbia's
Kosovo province. Two other papers also were banned.
	   The decree was then superseded by a restrictive media law that
levied hefty fines on media for articles authorities deemed
anti-state.
	   Again, Dnevni Telegraf publisher was among the first fined but
refused pay. Shortly after, police raided the newspaper's Belgrade
office, hauling away equipment in partial compensation for the
money owed.
	   The paper found a loophole and resumed publishing in Montenegro,
the other republic which together with Serbia makes up the Yugoslav
federation and where the new media law does not apply.

Immigrant job seekers robbed on way to factory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A group of immigrant job seekers became
robbery victims Monday at the hands of truckers who agreed to give
them a ride, police said.
	   The 30 Kurds, mainly from northern Iraq, were on their way from
a camp in a northern Athens suburb to look for work at a cement
factory in Mandra, about 30 kilometers (18 miles) west of Athens.
	   Police said the driver stopped the truck along the way then
joined two accomplices to rob the immigrants of a total of 180,000
drachmas (dlrs 640) and dlrs 300.
	   Tens of thousands of Kurds try to reach Greece each year from
Turkey and the Middle East seeking political asylum or clandestine
transport to other points in Europe. Kurds live in a region that
includes Syria, Turkey, Iraq and Iran.

Exhibition match against WIndies cancelled amid pay dispute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa's cricket board
cancelled Tuesday's exhibition match between an amateur 11 and the
West Indies side after a pay dispute held up the Caribbean team's
arrival.
	   The WIndies side was to have played a team sponsored by Nicky
Oppenheimer, the diamond magnate, to open its tour of South Africa.
	   The opening match -- if the tour goes forward -- now will be in
Soweto against a Gauteng provincial 11 on Wednesday.
	   The West Indians were locked in discussions in London Monday
over the dispute. Ali Bacher, head of the United Cricket Board of
South Africa, expressed optimism that the tour would go forward.
	   ``I expect to be returning home tonight and I am sure the West
Indian players will be with me on the plane,'' he told South
African Press Association.

	   BERLIN (AP) _ A memorial commemorating the mass deportation of
Berlin's Jews to concentration camps was found defaced with
swastikas Monday, the 60th anniversary of the Kristallnacht pogrom.
	   Three small swastikas were scratched around a Star of David on
the stone monument, which was erected on a railway bridge in 1987
and has been damaged several times since then.
	   It was not known exactly when the latest vandalism occurred,
police said.
	   Just south of Berlin in Potsdam, police reported a stone was
thrown through a window of a house on the grounds of a Jewish
cemetery early Monday.
	   Police said it was unclear whether the damage was related to the
anniversary of the Nov. 9, 1938 ``Night of Broken Glass,'' when
Nazi SA storm troopers led attacks on synagogues, Jewish businesses
and homes across Germany and Austria.

Incumbent mayor scores razor-thin victory in Bucharest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with final results, comment from mayor, turnout

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Mayor Viorel Lis has won a narrow
victory to keep his post as head of Romania's capital city for the
next two years, final results showed Monday.
	   Lis received 50.5 percent of the vote, according to the Central
Election Bureau. Sorin Oprescu, director of the city's Municipal
Hospital, trailed with 49.5 percent.
	   Lis said the mandate would give him new authority to resolve
Bucharest's problems. He said it was inevitable to see an erosion
of support for his party, the Democratic Convention, because it had
been in office for two years.
	   Turnout was low for the third straight Sunday, with only 37.8
percent of the 1.7 million eligible voters casting ballots.
	   Lis, 55, was the previous mayor's deputy and has been running
this city of 3 million since December 1996. He represents the
Democratic Convention, the main political force of the ruling
coalition which has run Bucharest since 1992.
	   Oprescu was supported by the leftist Party of Social Democracy
and nationalist parties. Some 22 candidates ran for elections. The
race was whittled down to Lis and Oprescu, who finished well ahead
of the other candidates, but failed to get over 50 percent for an
outright victory in the first two rounds.
	   Bucharest is overcrowded and plagued by problems with
substandard housing and a poor water supply, deteriorated roads and
pollution. Since 1989 when communism ended, problems have gotten
worse as the city's population has increased.
	   The election was necessary after previous mayor Victor Ciorbea
quit the post to become prime minister in 1996. He resigned from
that job in April, quitting as mayor at the same time.

NEC Corp. says it overcharged Japanese space agency for equipment
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By CHESTER DAWSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's NEC Corp. said Monday it had padded bills
for dozens of equipment orders from the government space agency
over the past five years, the latest revelation in a widening
scandal involving procurement contracts.
	   NEC, one of Japan's largest electronics manufacturers, said it
had billed the National Space Development Agency of Japan 2.3
billion yen (dlrs 19 million) in excess of what it was actually
owed between late 1993 and early 1998.
	   The disclosure came less than two weeks after NEC's chairman
announced plans to resign as prosecutors stepped up an
investigation into allegations of overcharging for defense agency
equipment contracts.
	   An in-house investigation at NEC found padded bills for 33 of 71
orders from the space agency during the five-year period, which had
a total value of 79.4 billion yen (dlrs 665.2 million), said space
agency spokesman Yoichi Fujita, citing an interim report from NEC.
	   The company issued a statement late Monday in which it expressed
regret for its actions and pledged to refund the excess money paid
by NASDA, the Japanese equivalent of NASA in the United States.
	   NASDA, which asked NEC to look into the matter in September and
first received confirmation of the overcharging last month, said it
has not decided what action, if any, it will take against the
company beyond requesting compensation for the overcharged amount.
	   The latest scandal could make it even more difficult for NEC to
restore the luster to its tarnished image following allegations of
double bookkeeping at NEC and two of its affiliates.
	   It has already has cost NEC's widely respected elder statesman,
Chairman Tadahiro Sekimoto, his job following the arrest of three
NEC officials.
	   Prosecutors say these affiliates overcharged the government
nearly 1.7 billion yen (dlrs 14.2 million) for military equipment _
something defense officials allegedly overlooked in exchange for
cushy jobs at the companies for retiring agency employees.
	   Ten other executives from the two NEC subsidiaries _ Nico
Electronics Co. and Toyo Communication Equipment Co. _ also have
been taken into custody, along with a pair of defense agency
officials.
	   The defense procurement scandal has cast a harsh light on the
relations between the government and private corporations in Japan,
especially in regard to the hiring of retired civil servants by
companies that they once oversaw.
	   This practice _ known as ``amakudari,'' or descent from heaven _
has come under increasing scrutiny recently in the wake of a number
of influence-peddling scandals.

EU unemployment below 10 percent for first time in 6 years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Unemployment in the European Union fell
to 9.9 percent in September, the first time in 6 years that the
jobless rate has fallen below 10 percent, the EU's statistics
office said Monday.
	   In the previous three months, Eurostat reported unemployment
holding steady at 10 percent across the 15-nation bloc. In
September 1997, the rate stood at 10.6 percent.
	   Eurostat said unemployment had been falling steadily since the
beginning of 1997, but its monthly report still showed 16.6 million
citizens out of work.
	   The EU rate compares with 4.6 percent in the United States and
4.2 percent in Japan.
	   Eurostat showed varying degrees of success in reducing
unemployment over the past six years. From December 1992, Danish
unemployment fell by more than half from 10 percent to 4.3 percent.
Ireland's rate dropped from 15.6 percent to 8.8 percent and
Britain's from 10.8 percent to 6.3 percent.
	   Over the same period, the jobless rate rose in Germany from 7.1
percent to 9.5 percent and in Italy from 9.2 percent to 12.3
percent.
	   Eurostat gave the following seasonally-adjusted jobless rates
for September 1998 with September 1997 rates in brackets:
	   Denmark, 4.3 percent (5.2); Austria, 4.5 (4.4); Portugal, 4.6
(6.7); Sweden, 7.7 (9.6); Belgium, 8.8 (9.2); Ireland, 8.8 (9.9);
Germany, 9.5 (10.2); Finland, 11.2 (12.4); France, 11.9 (12.4);
Spain, 18.7 (20.5).
	   September 1998 figures were unavailable for Luxembourg,
Netherlands, Britain, Italy and Greece.
	   Latest figures from Eurostat showed Luxembourg with 2.2 percent
and Netherlands with 3.7 percent in August, Britain with 6.3 and
Italy with 12.3 percent percent in July.
	   Eurostat gave no data for Greece.

Criticism rains down on Van Gaal as Barcelona slumps
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CIARAN GILES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Criticism rained down on FC Barcelona Dutch
coach Louis Van Gaal on Monday after the side slumped 2-1 against
mediocre Oviedo and proved unable to capitalize on a slip-up by
eternal rival Real Madrid.
	   ``Van Gaal is ruining Barca'' read the front-page headline of
the Barcelona-based national daily El Periodico de Catalunya while
the headline of the city's main sports daily, El Mundo Deportivo,
screamed ``No More.''
	   El Periodico said technical errors by Van Gaal were to blame for
the defending league and Spanish King's Cup champions losing the
game with just six minutes to play.
	   In the 88th minute, Barcelona was winning 1-0 on a sixth-minute
strike by Rivaldo. Two minutes into injury time the side was down
2-1.
	   The result left Barcelona at No. 4 with 16 points after nine
rounds. But a victory would have placed it joint No. 1 with
Mallorca given that Real Madrid slipped from the top on only
drawing 1-1 against Alaves.
	   The defeat also came too hot on the heels of the 2-1 midweek
home drubbing by Bayern Munich that put Barcelona on the verge of
elimination from the prized European Champions League.
	   ``Nervousness and uncertainty are wracking Barcelona just as in
the worst times of the past,'' El Periodico said in an editorial.
	   Although Barcelona won last season's league and cup, pressure
for greater success has been mounting after Real Madrid stole the
limelight on winning a record seventh European Champions cup.
	   Now Barcelona fans face the possibility of Madrid clinching an
eighth Champions cup in Barcelona's very own Camp Nou after the
stadium was chosen as the site for the next final.
	   Van Gaal, who triumphed with Ajax of Amsterdam prior to coming
to Barcelona, has angered club members by ditching many of the
side's young, homegrown stars such as Ivan de La Pena, and
substituting them with six fellow countrymen, including
international stars Patrick Kluivert and Philip Cocu.
	   In addition, Van Gaal 's cold, disciplined style is seen as a
colorless follow-up act to the flair and success of the Johan
Cruyff years, with stars such as Romario and Michael Laudrup, or
the spectacular season with Ronaldo under Cruyff's successor, Bobby
Robson.
	   ``All fans asked for was coherency, common sense and a team to
be proud off, whether it be made up of Spaniards, Catalans or
foreigners. Now it demands answers because all the coach can offer
after two years is a team confused by its own disorientation,'' El
Periodico added.
	   Next week, Barcelona faces struggling Tenerife in the Spanish
league before going on to host Manchester United in a decisive
Champions League bout.
	   Madrid faces Celta in the domestic championship before playing
Inter Milan away in the European competition.

Government releases four Sudanese dissidents from detention
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Four supporters of a deposed prime
minister have been released, more than a month after a court freed
them on the charge of disturbing public order, a newspaper reported
Monday.
	   The four men are followers of the al-Ansar Islamic sect of
former Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi whose elected government was
toppled by the 1989 coup that brought President Omar el-Bashir to
power.
	   The government alleges they wrote and delivered a sermon in a
mosque early July to incite people against the regime.
	   A court in Omdurman, the twin city of the capital, Khartoum,
ordered their release in early October but the government
immediately arrested them again without charging them.
	   The independent newspaper al-Usbou did not say why the four
dissidents have been freed now.
	   A government official said earlier this month that all political
prisoners will be released following the approval of a new
constitution which allows the formation of political associations.
	   One of the released, Abdel-Rahman Mahdi, told the daily that
during their detention they ``received cruel treatment'' from
security fores. He did not elaborate.
	   Three of the released are members of an organization that
supervises the religious and social affairs of the al-Ansar sect.
	   The fourth is Sheik Adam Ahmed Youssef, the prayer leader of the
Wad Nubawi mosque in Omdurman where the sermon was held.

Sixty years after ``Night of Broken Glass,'' German Jewish leader
</HEADLINE>
warns of extremism &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photo &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNE THOMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ On the 60th anniversary of the ``Night of Broken
Glass,'' when Nazi storm troopers destroyed Jewish businesses and
synagogues, the leader of Germany's Jews warned Monday against a
trend of ``intellectual nationalism'' that gives comfort to
right-wing extremism.
	   Ignatz Bubis, who as leader of the Central Council of German
Jews is the most prominent spokesman for the Jewish community,
noted with alarm that ideas once considered extremist were now
making their way into the mainstream.
	   The commemoration of Kristallnacht, when more than 1,300
synagogues were destroyed and Jewish businesses were burned
throughout Germany and Austria, has special significance this year
as a new generation of forward-looking leaders with no personal
recollection of the Holocaust take office.
	   Led by 54-year-old Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, the government
returns next year to Germany's prewar capital, Berlin, seat of
Hitler's dictatorship and the earlier Prussian military state.
	   Remarks by Bubis and others reflected concerns that the
government's move and the generational change underscore a desire
to return to ``normality'' _ for some a Germany unburdened by guilt
for the Holocaust _ by overlooking the past.
	   Underscoring concerns about a resurgence of anti-Semitism, tiny
swastikas were found Monday scratched on a Star of David memorial
in Berlin commemorating the mass deportation of the city's Jews to
concentration camps.
	   Bubis' harshest criticism was aimed at a prominent German
author, Martin Walser, who in a recent speech suggested that the
Holocaust and death camp images have been used to preserve a sense
of guilt among Germans.
	   During a ceremony honoring Walser with the Frankfurt book fair
peace prize, the 71-year-old writer, whose work examines how German
can deal with the Nazi past, said he has learned to turn away from
scenes of the Holocaust.
	   ``This trend in Walser's speech can be clearly traced. The
intellectual nationalism is growing and is not wholly free of an
undercurrent of anti-Semitism,'' Bubis said.
	   ``Whenever someone who is counted among the spiritual elite of
the nation makes such statements, they carry a weight of their own
... It is certain that right-wing extremists will refer to
Walser.''
	   The example underscored a theme in several of the speeches at
the national commemoration at an eastern Berlin synagogue: Germans
have not yet found the right way to preserve memory of the
Holocaust as a lesson for future generations.
	   ``Walser and many talk about a 'normality,''' Bubis said. ``I
don't know what they mean by that. For me, normality is to be a Jew
and to be able to live in Germany again, (it means) that Jews are
engaged in the business and political life of the republic and that
we have a democracy of a kind that has not long existed on German
soil.
	   ```Normality'' cannot mean that we supplant memory and live with
a new anti-Semitism and new racism.''
	   Germany's president, Roman Herzog, urged the nation to find a
way to remember the horrors of the night that presaged the
Holocaust and the Nazis pogrom of a ``final solution'' to
exterminate Europe's Jews. More than 6 million Jews were murdered
by the Nazis.
	   ``We shouldn't forget for one second that our children and their
children don't have an idea any more of what a dictatorship,
degradation and mass annihilation really means, how all these
horrors don't just befall a people all at once, and so how
necessary it is to pay attention to the small signs at the
beginning.
	   ``And I'll say it again: I'm not sure if we've found the right
way to prepare the successive generations for this fundamental
necessity.''

Chinese dissidents step up efforts to form opposition party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Defying police pressure, Chinese dissidents have
appealed directly to the government in Beijing to approve their
efforts to set up an opposition party, a human rights group said
Monday.
	   Dissidents meeting Sunday in the southeastern city of Hangzhou
sent an application to the State Council, or Cabinet, asking to
officially register a preparatory committee of the would-be China
Democracy Party, the rights group said.
	   The group, the Hong Kong-based Information Center for Human
Rights and Democratic Movement in China, said the application was
sent on behalf of 53 members of the party in 23 provinces and major
cities.
	   Since June, dissidents have been trying to officially register
branches of the party, so far without success, to challenge the
ruling Communist Party's monopoly on power. Police have detained
many of the party's supporters, mostly for short periods of time.
	   The Information Center said the latest application mailed to
Beijing on Sunday asked that the State Council agree to register a
national preparatory committee for the China Democracy Party.
	   The 53 backers of the appeal included some of the best-known
dissidents still remaining in China, including veteran activists
Ren Wanding and Xu Wenli, the group said.

 &UR; Belgrade court fines independent daily &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A Belgrade court has fined the
publisher and chief editor of an independent daily the maximum 1.2
million dinars (dlrs 120,000) for breaching Serbia's restrictive
new information law, media reported Monday.
	   Following a trial held Sunday against formerly banned Dnevi
Telegraf, the court ruled that its publishing company and chief
editor would pay the steep amount for ``publishing information
inciting destruction of the constitutional order.''
	   The verdict and the trial against the newspaper, known for its
criticism of President Slobodan Milosevic's autocratic regime, came
only a day after it resumed publishing following weeks of
government bans, court trials and police raids.
	   In its first edition Saturday, Dnevni Telegraf ran an ad paid by
a Belgrade University student group that called for the abolishment
of the existing government.
	   Four students belonging to the group were arrested last week for
spraying graffiti of the group's symbol, a clenched fist, and
sentenced to ten days imprisonment.
	   Within hours of running the ad, a high-ranking Serbian official
and a close Milosevic associate sued the daily, saying it violated
Serbia's recently enacted media law.
	   The defendants and their lawyers stormed out of the Belgrade
district court Sunday after two hours of hearings, protesting the
partiality of the judge.
	   The court verdict gave the publisher 24 hours to pay the fine.
	   Dnevni Telegraf said in its Monday edition that its publisher
does not have the financial means to pay the fine and predicted
Serbian authorities would start confiscating the next day's edition
Monday night.
	   Dnevni Telegraf was first banned last month when Serbia's
government passed a decree demanding strictly ``patriotic''
coverage of events, especially the ongoing crisis in Serbia's
Kosovo province. Two other papers also were banned.
	   The decree was then superseded by a restrictive media law that
levied hefty fines on media for articles authorities deemed
anti-state.
	   Again, Dnevni Telegraf publisher was among the first fined but
refused pay. Shortly after, police raided the newspaper's Belgrade
office, hauling away equipment in partial compensation for the
money owed.
	   The paper found a loophole and resumed publishing in Montenegro,
the other republic which together with Serbia makes up the Yugoslav
federation and where the new media law does not apply.

Turkey constructs pipeline for Iranian, Turkmen gas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ERZURUM, Turkey (AP) _ Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz broke ground
Monday for part of a pipeline to carry both Iranian and Turkmen
natural gas to Turkey and the rest of Europe.
	   Despite U.S. criticism, Turkey is scheduled to receive Iranian
gas by mid-1999 through a pipeline already under construction
between this eastern city and the Iranian border.
	   ``The first 100 kilometers (62 miles) of the pipeline have
already been built,'' said Nevzat Arseven, head of the state-owned
pipeline company Botas, in reference to the 301-kilometer
(188-mile) pipeline between Erzurum and the Iranian border.
	   Yilmaz broke ground on the Erzurum-to-Ankara leg.
	   The United States, which accuses Iran of sponsoring terrorism,
has criticized the Iranian gas deal signed in 1996. But, in dire
need of natural gas, Turkey sees the Iranian option as its quickest
relief.
	   ``We have revitalized that project,'' Yilmaz said.
	   The country's demand for natural gas, both for industry and
residential heating, is expected to quadruple to 45 billion cubic
meters a year (1.6 trillion cubic feet) by 2005.
	   According to the dlrs 20 billion deal with Iran, Turkey will
initially buy 3 billion cubic meters (105 billion cubic feet) of
gas from its eastern neighbor each year. The amount will be
quadrupled later.
	   ``We are aiming to finish our part of the pipeline in 24
months,'' said Uzeyir Garih, president of Alarko holding, which
will build one-third of the pipeline between Erzurum and Ankara.
The whole construction project to Ankara is scheduled to end in
2001.
	   Turkey also plans to purchase gas from Turkmenistan but it is
not expected for another four years. In a deal signed last month
Turkey agreed to purchase some 16 billion cubic meters (560 billion
cubic feet) of gas each year.
	   It is unclear which route that gas would be transported through.
But Washington has encouraged Turkey and Turkmenistan to opt for a
pipeline crossing the Caspian Sea and not use the Iranian pipeline
to transfer the gas.
	   Erzurum would then be the main junction for pipelines running
from Iran and Turkmenistan through to the capital Ankara, some 880
kilometers (550 miles) to the west.
	   Ankara is also vying for an oil pipeline that would transport
Caspian Sea oil to Turkey's Mediterranean coast.
	   ``God willing, the oil pipeline will also be realized soon,''
Energy Minister Cumhur Ersumer said.
	   An international oil consortium is expected to announce its
decision on the route of the oil pipeline early December.

<TEXT>
	   --
	   WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) _ The home affairs minister says he plans
to introduce legislation that would outlaw homosexuality and impose
fines and prison sentences on offenders.
	   The official, Jerry Ekandjo, said homosexual rights could never
qualify as human rights, echoing earlier statements by President
Sam Nujoma and other Southern African leaders, including presidents
Frederic Chiluba of Zambia and Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe.
	   ``Gays' and lesbians' rights can never qualify to be fundamental
human rights because, if a male dog knows its right partner as a
female dog, how can a human being fail to notice the difference? If
a female pig knows its right partner as a male pig, how can a human
being fail to notice the difference?'' Ekandjo said in a speech to
Parliament Friday widely reported Monday.
	   The Namibian Constitution guarantees the right to the freedom of
association as a fundamental human right. Human rights activists
criticized such legislation as discriminatory.
	   ``This is a already a very marginalized group,'' said Clinton
Light of the Windhoek-based Legal Assistance Center. ``It's not
like it's New York-style gay pride here. Namibia doesn't need to
become a laughingstock.''
	   Namibia's small gay rights group The Rainbow Project also
slammed the speech.
	   ``We find it very obscure that Mr. Ekandjo uses the sexual
behaviour of 'pigs' and 'dogs' as a model for sexual morality.
Instead, we question Mr. Ekandjo's morality in attempting to deny
others their human rights,'' the group said.
	   --
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ A senior military official has visited the
family of the late human rights activist and playwright Ken Saro
Wiwa, a newspaper reported Monday.
	   Sam Ewang, administrator of southeastern Rivers State, traveled
to Wiwa's home village of Bane on Saturday to commemorate the third
anniversary of the activist's hanging, on Nov. 10, 1995, the Lagos
Guardian reported.
	   ``There is no alternative to peace,'' Ewang told assembled
family members.
	   Former Nigerian dictator Gen. Sani Abacha ordered the hangings
of Wiwa and eight other activists of the minority Ogoni ethnic
group on treason, despite international appeals for clemency.
	   The hangings drew worldwide condemnation and led to Nigeria's
expulsion from the Commonwealth as well as the imposition of
sanctions against the West African nation.
	   Welcoming the visit, the first by any senior government official
since the executions, Wiwa's father described it as ``historic and
symbolic,'' the paper reported.
	   --
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ Three lawmakers of the opposition National
Party were suspended from Parliament for refusing to follow policy,
the party said.
	   The party's deputy Secretary-General Jacob Chikwenda said the
three were officially suspended by the Parliament at the request of
the party.
	   The three, Benny Tetamashimba, Patrick Kangwa and John Muasa,
had lobbied for a change in leadership.
	   Tetmashimba has claimed the three were victimized because party
Secretary-General Ludwig Sondashi himself was campaigning for the
leadership. The three lawmakers favor Anderson Mazoka, a corporate
executive, for the party's top post.
	   Zambia's opposition has been riven by infighting since President
Chiluba won a second five-year term in 1996.
	   --
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ At least 250 rebels have entered northern
Uganda from their base in Sudan on a mission to abduct youth, kill
and loot, a newspaper said Monday.
	   The state-owned New Vision newspaper said the Lord's Resistance
Army rebels crossed the border to Uganda Friday night through Lela
Bul, about 360 kilometers (225 miles) north of Kampala.
	   Government forces captured one rebel, who said the group had
orders to mine roads in northern Uganda, according to the
newspaper.
	   ``The captured rebel has said many women are among the rebels,
and have come to carry looted food and goods,'' the daily quoted a
security source as saying.
	   Security at protected villages and camps in northern Kitgum and
Gulu districts will be tightened, the source said.
	   Apart from fighting to overthrow President Yoweri Museveni, the
rebel movement's objectives are not clear.
	   --
	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ Rains in the central Mozambican
province of Sofala are threatening to cut the Beira-Zimbabwe
highway.
	   The Maputo daily paper, Noticias, says the rains flooded several
suburbs of the port city and interrupted traffic on roads.
Officials said some houses were submerged and trees knocked down,
but no injuries were reported.
	   More than 160 millimeters of rain had fallen on Beira at the
weekend, but forecasters say the rain should taper off.

Anti-British dissident criticizes arrests of eight, including son
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ An anti-British politician opposed to
Northern Ireland's peace accord on Monday condemned the weekend
arrests of eight members of the Republican Sinn Fein party, among
them his son.
	   ``We request civil liberties bodies to note this blatant attempt
at intimidation and the denial of freedom of expression,'' said
Ruairi O Bradaigh, who founded his party in 1986 after the
mainstream Sinn Fein party, led by Gerry Adams, decided to run in
elections in the Irish Republic.
	   Despite his denials, detectives consider O Bradaigh's party to
be the public face of the Continuity IRA, a dissident armed group
that refuses to join the 15-month-old truce being observed by the
mainstream Irish Republican Army.
	   On Sunday, police arrested eight supporters, including O
Bradaigh's son Ruairi Og, after staking out Republican Sinn Fein's
annual conference in Drogheda, north of Dublin.
	   Police declined to detail why the eight _ five from the Irish
Republic, three from Northern Ireland _ were being questioned.
	   O Bradaigh was president of Sinn Fein until Adams' supporters
ousted him in 1983.
	   At his splinter party's conference, he criticized Sinn Fein's
decision to back April's historic accord despite the fact it fails
to achieve traditional IRA objectives _ the abolition of Northern
Ireland as a separate state, the withdrawal of British troops, and
the disbandment of Northern Ireland's predominantly Protestant
police force.
	   The Continuity IRA dissidents planted several car bombs in
Northern Ireland towns during the IRA's 1994 truce, which collapsed
after 17 months.
	   Another dissident armed group, the so-called Real IRA, planted
an August car bomb in the Northern Ireland town of Omagh that
killed 29 people and wounded 370, the deadliest terrorist strike in
Northern Ireland history. The Real IRA subsequently called a
cease-fire.
	   Nobody has been charged in connection with that attack, despite
the energency passage in Britain and Ireland of toughened
anti-terror laws.

Former U.S. hostages receive death threat in Iran
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An Iranian newspaper on Monday published a
threat, purportedly by an Islamic radical group, to carry out
suicide attacks against Americans held hostage during the 1979 U.S.
Embassy takeover if they ever returned to Iran.
	   The hard-line Qods newspaper said the threat was delivered by an
anonymous caller who said he belonged to Fedayeen Islam, or
Volunteers for Martyrdom for Islam, which has not been heard from
for more than a decade.
	   The threat was chiefly directed against former hostages Barry
Rosen and Bruce Laingen, who have said they would be willing to
visit Iran.
	   Fedayeen was active in fighting the U.S.-backed Shah's regime
during the 1960s and the period leading to the 1979 Islamic
Revolution that overthrew the Shah. The group was blamed for the
1965 assassination of then-Prime Minister Hassan Ali Mansoor.
	   The Farsi-language Qods said the Fedayeen ``warned that it
considers itself duty bound to carry out suicide attacks against
Bruce Laingen and Barry Rosen and other individuals associated with
the den of spies if they return to Iran.''
	   Militant Islamic students who stormed the embassy and took 52
Americans hostage for 444 days referred to the embassy as the ``den
of spies.''
	   At a demonstration last week to mark the 19th anniversary of the
seizure, the student leaders who seized the embassy invited former
hostages to return to Iran.
	   All but about six of the students who were once zealous
supporters of the Islamic Revolution and its leader, Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, are now considered moderates who back President
Mohammad Khatami's call for dialogue with the American people.
	   Several hold key posts in Khatami's administration.
	   But a new breed of hard-liners clustered around the supreme
leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is opposed to any compromise with
the United States. At a rally outside the former embassy last week,
the hard-liners burned effigies of Uncle Sam and called for ``Death
to America!''
	   Laingen, who as charge d'affaires was the most senior diplomat
among the American hostages, said last week he has looked forward
to returning to Iran following a new relationship between Iran and
the United States.
	   Rosen, a former press attache at the embassy who now heads the
public affairs department of Teachers College at Columbia
University, said he also would ``be in favor of going back to
Iran'' at the right time.
	   The anonymous caller who phoned in the death threat told Qods
the group was made up of ``youths and combatants who consider it
their duty to implement the dictates of Islam.''

EU clears Toyota's purchase of majority share in Daihatsu
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union competition regulators
gave the all-clear Monday to the purchase by Toyota Motor Corp. of
a majority stake in its affiliate, Daihatsu Motor Corp.
	   ``The overlap between the product ranges of Toyota and Daihatsu
is limited both at overall EU level and in each individual (EU)
member state,'' the European Commission said in a statement.
	   The Commission has powers to examine major mergers or alliances
between companies doing business in the 15 EU nations, even if they
involve only non-European firms.
	   In August, Toyota said it will pay about 37 billion yen (dlrs
313 million) to increase its share in Daihatsu from its existing
34.5 percent to 51.2 percent.
	   Toyota, Japan's largest automaker, said closer ties with
Daihatsu will help the companies confront intensifying global
competition and share technology in developing environment-friendly
vehicles.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A strike by airport ground workers forced
cancellation or rescheduling of flights at Italian airports Monday,
the first in a series of walkouts this week that threatened to make
travel in Italy tough going.
	   About 50 flights were canceled at each of Italy's two main
international airports, Milan's Malpensa and Rome's Leonardo da
Vinci.
	   The walkout was scheduled to last from 12:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m.
(1130-1530 gmt) Monday.
	   Airport ground personnel are protesting failed contract talks
and difficult working conditions at revamped Malpensa, plagued by
days of chaos after the new hub opened Oct. 25.

Singapore ruling party leaders drop claims to opposition leader's
</HEADLINE>
property &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore ruling party leaders on Monday
dropped claims to property linked to opposition leader Tang Lian
Hong, who lost a multimillion-dollar libel case last year and was
proclaimed bankrupt after fleeing the country.
	   Tang's assets in Singapore consist of a heavily mortgaged family
villa and a piece of land. Although the assets are registered in
the name of Tang's wife, the ruling party's lawyers said in
February that she was just holding them in trust for her husband,
and demanded that they be seized.
	   Lawyers for Singapore patriarch Lee Kuan Yew have instructed the
High Court to drop the proceedings, saying they ``did not wish to
deprive (Mrs. Tang) of whatever little property she had,''
Singapore TV reported.
	   The defamation case involved name-calling between Tang and
government leaders during a parliamentary election campaign in
December 1996. Tang, charged with tax evasion and sued for 4
million Singapore dollars (dlrs 2.4 million) in libel damages, fled
to Australia.
	   In his absence, Tang was found to have defamed the leaders by
calling them ``liars.'' He made the charge in response to
government members labeling him an ``anti-Christian,
anti-English-educated, Chinese chauvinist.''
	   Dominant for more than three decades, the People's Action Party
holds all but three seats in Singapore's 84-seat parliament.
	   Tang, 62, is a lawyer who took his first step into politics in
1996 as a candidate for the small Workers' Party, the only
opposition.
	   The United States in the past has criticized the Singapore
government for using legal procedures such as defamation suits and
tax evasion charges to intimidate opponents and stifle political
debate.

Israel to delay West Bank withdrawal despite U.S. pressure
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Netanyahu's office denying Albright expressed an
opinion on how to revoke the PLO founding charter &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Despite new U.S. demands that Israel stick to
the timetable of the Wye peace agreement, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said Monday he will not move forward until the
Palestinians do more to combat Islamic militants.
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, said Israel will
probably not begin its phased troop withdrawal from 13 percent of
the West Bank on Nov. 16, as stipulated by the land-for-security
accord with the Palestinians.
	   ``There will be a few days' delay, I presume,'' Bar-Illan said.
	   Israel appears to be at odds with the United States on three key
issues of the peace accord _ the time table, continued Jewish
settlement expansion and the procedure for revoking provisions in
the PLO founding charter calling for Israel's destruction.
	   In a phone call last week, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright told Netanyahu that she expected Israel to implement the
agreement on time, said U.S. Embassy spokesman Larry Schwartz.
	   ``Our understanding is that the Wye timetable will not slip,''
Schwartz told The Associated Press. ``The timetable is meant to
continue as it was signed.''
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said the agreement is ``as
good as dead'' if Israel refuses to carry out the withdrawals on
time. ``He (Netanyahu) cannot expect to have implementation of one
part of the agreement, our commitments, and postpone the other
part,'' he said.
	   Concerning the PLO charter, Albright sided with the Palestinians
who say the clauses need to be changed by acclamation, but not by a
vote, the Maariv daily said.
	   Netanyahu's office denied that Albright expressed an opinion on
the procedure. Schwartz would only say that the conversation
between Netanyahu and Albright was private.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Talks aimed at rescuing the West Indies cricket
tour of South Africa moved into a fourth day Monday amid signs that
a settlement could be reached in time for the team to fly to
Johannesburg Monday night.
	   As the crisis dragged on, South Africa's cricket board was
forced to call off the first match of the three-month tour _
Tuesday's warmup between the West Indies and an amateur 11 in
Randjiesfontein, near Johannesburg.
	   The opening match _ if the tour goes forward _ now will be in
Soweto on Wednesday against a Gauteng provincial 11. The first Test
is set for Nov. 26.
	   The West Indies players, holding up the tour in a pay dispute,
were scheduled to resume negotiations with West Indian Cricket
Board officials at a hotel near Heathrow Airport.
	   Tentative plans were being made for a news conference Monday
afternoon.
	   Ali Bacher, head of the United Cricket Board of South Africa,
expressed optimism that the tour would go ahead.
	   ``I expect to be returning home tonight and I am sure the West
Indian players will be with me on the plane,'' he said.
	   But WICB president Pat Rousseau, who arrived Sunday for the
talks, indicated the impasse was continuing.
	   ``They (the players) are creating a lot of problems for us,'' he
said.
	   The crisis began Wednesday when Rousseau fired superstar batsman
Brian Lara as captain and Carl Hooper as vice-captain after they
demanded better pay and conditions for the historic South African
tour.
	   This would be the West Indies' first official tour of the
republic since the end of apartheid.
	   Bacher, West Indies tour manager Clive Lloyd, and WICB member
Joel Garner arrived in London Friday for the talks.
	   One of the hang-ups may be player demands that Lara and Hooper
be reinstated.
	   Progress was reported over the weekend with the announcement of
a sponsorship deal offered by former South African wicketkeeper
David Richardson, who runs a sports marketing firm in Johannesburg.
	   Earnings from the sponsorship proposal would apparently help
meet the players' demands for better pay, which is reported to
range from dlrs 15,000 to 60,000 for the South African tour.
	   Reported solutions include more prize money, increased meal
money, and the reinstatement of Lara and Hopper to the squad. There
are also suggestions that Courtney Walsh would be named captain.

Palestinian official renews demand for an independent state
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A senior Palestinian official said Monday
that the Palestinian Authority will declare statehood next year
despite Israeli objections.
	   ``There is no backing off on our commitment to declare
independence on May 4, 1999,'' Nabil Shaath, Palestinian minister
of planning and international cooperation, was quoted as saying by
Egypt's Middle East News Agency.
	   ``Whether we reach an agreement with the Israelis on May 4 or
not ... the Palestinian state will be declared,'' Shaath said.
	   May 4, 1999 is the day when the two sides must conclude a final
land agreement under the 1993 Oslo peace accord between Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat and then Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
	   Shaath's remarks contradict an understanding Rabin's successor,
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, reached last month in Wye
Plantation with Arafat not to declare an independent Palestinian
state before the two sides agree on a final peace formula.
	   Efforts to work out Oslo were stalled after Rabin was
assassinated in 1995 and Palestinian militants attacked Israelis in
a series of bloody bombings.
	   Shaath is in Cairo for a meeting with Arab League's officials to
brief them on the Wye agreement under which Israel agreed to cede
13 percent additional land from the West Bank to the Palestinian
Authority in exchange for increased counter-terrorism action by the
Palestinians. Israel postponed implementing the agreement after
Friday's bombing in Jerusalem.
	   Shaath said the Palestinians will urge the Arab governments to
stop normalization of ties with Israel until it implements its
commitments in the deal.
	   The Palestinians want the Arabs to refrain from contacts with
Israel including in the Middle East economic conferences and the
multilateral peace discussions, he said.
	   The United States has been urging the Arab governments to drop
their reservations and warm up relations with the Jewish state.

Prominent Human Rights barred from leaving Turkey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ A prominent human rights activist on his
way to Norway for medical treatment was barred from leaving Turkey
Monday, his association said in a statement.
	   Police stopped Akin Birdal from boarding his flight, claiming
that he could not leave the country since an appeals court had
upheld a one-year prison sentence against him in October, the
association said.
	   Birdal was convicted of inciting racial hatred for a speech he
made two years ago calling for a peaceful solution to the war
between autonomy-seeking Kurdish rebels and government troops in
Turkey's southeast.
	   Turkey already suffered great embarrassment when 11 men shot
Birdal repeatedly in his office in central Ankara in May. The men
were apparently linked to a terrorist once employed by the state to
kill people deemed as threats to national security.
	   Birdal, well-respected in the West for his campaign against
torture and the army's forced evacuation of Kurdish villages in
Turkey's southeast, is still recovering from the assassination
attempt.
	   No date has been set for Birdal to begin serving his sentence,
said an official of the Human Rights Association, which Birdal
presides.
	   Close to 37,000 people have died since the Kurdish insurgency
began in 1984.

Taliban set deadline for evidence against bin Laden
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ The Taliban religious army wants
evidence of Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden's involvement in
terrorist activity by Nov. 20 or ``in our eyes he will be
acquitted,'' Abdul Hai Muttmayan said Monday.
	   Bin Laden, Washington's Enemy No. 1, has been indicted by a U.S.
court in the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania that killed 224 people. Washington has offered dlrs 5
million for his arrest.
	   The Taliban said they won't turn bin Laden over to the United
States, but if the U.S. administration has evidence of his
involvement in terrorist activity he will be tried under the
religious militia's strict Islamic laws.
	   About two weeks ago the Taliban set up a judicial inquiry,
headed by the Chief Justice Noor Mohammed Saqib, to investigate
allegations against bin Laden.
	   In the 90 percent of Afghanistan controlled by the Taliban, a
harsh form of Islamic law is enforced which imposes the death
penalty for terrorism.
	   But so far the judicial inquiry doesn't have any evidence to
back Washington's claims that bin Laden heads a terrorist network
of Muslim militants devoted to attacking U.S. interests worldwide.
	   ``If anyone has any evidence of bin Laden's involvement in cases
of terrorism, subversion, sabotage or any other acts they should
present it to the court before Nov. 20,'' said Muttmayan.
	   ``If by then there is nothing we will close the case and in our
eyes he will be acquitted,'' he said.
	   The Taliban army say bin Laden is their honored guest and in
Afghan society that guarantees him protection from his enemies and
right now his biggest enemy appears to be the United States.
	   Washington fired Tomahawk cruise missiles Aug. 20 at eastern
Afghanistan striking suspected terrorist camps believed to be
operated by bin Laden, the man whose loathing for the United States
is linked to the presence of U.S. troops in his native Saudi
Arabia.
	   The Taliban say the United States is ``hostile'' to bin Laden,
whom they say has promised not to use Afghanistan as a staging
arena for terrorist attacks elsewhere.
	   But U.S. intelligence officials paint a picture of bin Laden's
network that links his militant fighters with attacks on U.S.
troops and citizens in Somalia, Saudi Arabia and East Africa.

Chechen opposition leaders meet, seek president's resignation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RUSLAN MUSAYEV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ More than 1,000 former rebels gathered in
Russia's breakaway republic of Chechnya on Monday as part of a
congress in opposition of Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov.
	   Two former rebel leaders and Maskhadov opponents, Shamil Basayev
and Salman Raduyev, led the National Congress of Chechen Peoples
meeting, but said no official decisions were made.
	   ``The main significance of the congress is that the Chechens
themselves will decide their destiny and will be its masters,''
Basayev said.
	   At the same time, Maskhadov held a meeting with his supporters
in the village where former Chechen leader Dzhokhar Dudayev was
killed.
	   Dudayev seized power in Chechnya in 1991. He led Chechnya into
its 1994 war with Russia, but was killed by Russian forces.
	   The two gatherings followed a meeting between Basayev and
Maskhadov, in which both men said they should solve their conflicts
through peaceful means, ITAR-Tass said.
	   The men fought together to drive the Russian troops out of
Chechnya, and Basayev served as Maskhadov's prime minister during
the first half of this year.
	   But Basayev and other former rebels have been increasingly
critical of Maskhadov and are seeking his ouster. They accuse him
of violating Chechnya's constitution, and demand he be impeached
for failing to bring peace to the republic since the end of the war
two years ago.
	   Meanwhile, Russian Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin reiterated
the Russian government's support for Maskhadov, even though Moscow
disagrees over with Chechnya over its political status. Chechnya
considers itself independent, Moscow considers it part of Russia.
	   Maskhadov ``is supported by Russia and other countries,''
Stepashin said. ``We do not propose suspending cooperation with
Chechen law enforcement agencies.''

Prestigious Goncourt goes to Paule Constant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The Goncourt prize, France's most prestigious
literary award, went Monday to a novel set entirely in the Kansas
home of a university professor who attends a feminist colloquium on
witches.
	   Paule Constant's ``Confidence Pour Confidence,'' (Confidence For
Confidence) published by Gallimard, is a psychological drama about
a character named Gloria Potter, a scholar of women's studies.
	   Author Constant is regarded as one of France's top contemporary
literary figures.
	   The Goncourt carries a purse of only 50 francs (about dlrs 10)
but guarantees instant fame to the winner, and healthy profits to
both writer and publisher.
	   Constant, 53, lives in Aix-en-Provence, where she teaches French
literature to foreign students. ``Confidence Pour Confidence'' is
her eighth book.
	   Also Monday, the Renaudot prize _ awarded for a first novel _
went to Dominique Bona for ``Le Manuscrit de Port-Ebene,'' a novel
set in the Dominican Republic, published by Grasset.
	   The Renaudot winner gets a free lunch next year at Drouant, the
posh Parisian restaurant where the laureates are announced.

EU warns U.S. against imposing sanctions over banana imports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union warned the United
States Monday not to impose trade sanctions to counter the EU's
banana import regime, adding Washington would face ``extremely
damaging consequences.''
	   The warning followed weekend threats from the United States that
punitive action may be taken if the 15-nation EU does not change
its banana trade system, which Washington claims unfairly favors
imports from former European colonies.
	   ``If the U.S. goes down the unilateral road, we believe it would
have extremely damaging consequences'' for the transatlantic
relationship, said EU foreign trade spokesman Nigel Gardner.
	   Last month, the U.S. administration outlined possible
retaliation against the European Union if the EU defies a rulings
by the World Trade Organization on the international banana trade.
	   The London Financial Times said Monday Washington would issue a
preliminary list of EU products this week on which the United
States will impose sanctions to retaliate against the banana import
regime.
	   If Washington goes ahead with the move, EU countries are
expected to respond in kind, raising the specter of a transatlantic
trade war, EU officials said.
	   The United States is unhappy with the EU's efforts so far to
respond to last year's negative WTO ruling on the banana regime,
which grants favorable treatment to a number of African, Caribbean,
and Pacific region countries.
	   The WTO suit championed banana growers in Latin America who felt
discriminated by the regime.
	   The EU approved new import regulations in an attempt to remedy
the situation and bring it into line with WTO regulations. But the
United States and Latin Americans claim it is still discriminatory.

Israel to delay West Bank withdrawal despite U.S. pressure
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 8 grafs with Netanyahu's office denying Albright
expressed an opinion on how to revoke the PLO founding charter.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Despite new U.S. demands that Israel stick to
the timetable of the Wye peace agreement, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said Monday he will not move forward until the
Palestinians do more to combat Islamic militants.
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, said Israel will
probably not begin its phased troop withdrawal from 13 percent of
the West Bank on Nov. 16, as stipulated by the land-for-security
accord with the Palestinians.
	   ``There will be a few days' delay, I presume,'' Bar-Illan said.
	   Israel appears to be at odds with the United States on three key
issues of the peace accord _ the timetable, continued Jewish
settlement expansion and the procedure for revoking provisions in
the PLO founding charter calling for Israel's destruction.
	   In a phone call last week, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright told Netanyahu that she expected Israel to implement the
agreement on time, said U.S. Embassy spokesman Larry Schwartz.
	   ``Our understanding is that the Wye timetable will not slip,''
Schwartz told The Associated Press. ``The timetable is meant to
continue as it was signed.''
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said the agreement is ``as
good as dead'' if Israel refuses to carry out the withdrawals on
time. ``He (Netanyahu) cannot expect to have implementation of one
part of the agreement, our commitments, and postpone the other
part,'' he said.
	   Concerning the PLO charter, Albright sided with the Palestinians
who say the clauses need to be changed by acclamation, but not by a
vote, the Maariv daily said.
	   Netanyahu's office denied that Albright expressed an opinion on
the procedure. Schwartz would only say that the conversation
between Netanyahu and Albright was private.

Remains found in Russia may be mass grave of British soldiers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Human remains found in northern Russia may be part
of a mass grave of British soldiers sent to quash the Communist
revolution in 1918, the British Ministry of Defense confirmed
Monday.
	   Discussions are under way between the defense ministry and
Russian officials about investigating the site in a field near
Kandalaksha, spokeswoman Kate O'Connor said.
	   ``There are remains. We don't know the numbers as of yet,'' she
said.
	   Britain was alerted to the grave by a local resident working in
the area, the Guardian newspaper reported Monday.
	   The bodies are thought to be casualties of Britain's contingent
in the international intervention force sent to port cities in 1918
in a covert bid to reverse the Russian revolution, the paper said.
	   An estimated 200,000 Allied soldiers were involved in the
unsuccessful mission.
	   George Pappadopoullos, who leads an army group that works to
identify newly found bodies of British soldiers, told The Guardian
that ``delicate negotiations'' were under way that would allow for
descendants to be traced so they could attend funerals in Russia.

Romanian Jews commemorate night of Nazi terror
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NOTE contents in 8th graf
 &UR; By MIHAELA ARMASELU &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ About 60 Jews, including a few
concentration camp survivors, commemorated the 60th anniversary of
a night of Nazi terror that presaged the Holocaust.
	   The group gathered in the northwestern part of Romania, known as
Transylvania, which was part of Hungary during World War II. Some
160,000 Jews were deported from the region to concentration camps.
Only 30,000 survived.
	   ``The suffering started then, during the Kristallnacht, and even
though (dozens) of nations were affected by war, humankind did not
learn too much from it,'' said Felix Kopperman, the leader of the
small Jewish community in the Transylvanian city of Oradea, where
the commemoration was held.
	   Some 40,000 Jews were deported from Oradea, about 450 kilometers
(281 miles) northwest of Bucharest, and only 3,000 returned. Today
about 400 Jews live there.
	   Nazi troops burned hundreds of synagogues and Jewish shops and
houses in Germany and Austria on Nov. 9, 1938. The evening has
become known as Kristallnacht, or the Night of Broken Glass.
	   The rampage, less than one year before the start of World War
II, was in reprisal for the shooting of a German diplomat in Paris
by a young Jew.
	   The Transylvanian Jews who perished in the Holocaust were
deported after April 1944 by the fascist Hungarian dictator Miklos
Horthy.
	   After the war, the Jewish community in Oradea built a monument
dedicated to the dead Jews. They buried soap made of Jewish bones,
inscribed with RJS - Reine Judische Seife, which means Pure Jewish
Soap.
	   A choir of Jewish children sang songs of mourning at the

	   ``No commemoration or monument can bring back my parents or my
brother,'' said Lazar Freund, 72, a Holocaust survivor whose family
perished at the Mauthausen concentration camp in Austria.
	   About half of the 800,000 Jews who lived in Romania before the
war were killed. Another 400,000 left for Israel after 1945,
leaving only about 14,000 in country now.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The bodies of two Serb policemen
were found in central Kosovo on Monday, Serb officials said, in the
latest evidence a month-old cease-fire in the troubled province is
coming under increasing strain.
	   The policemen, who went missing last Friday, were found by a
police patrol near Malisevo. Initial findings indicated they had
been shot at close range, the Serb Media Center said.
	   The report comes with scattered violence on the upswing in
Kosovo, four weeks after the agreement between Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. negotiator Richard Holbrooke aimed at
halting the conflict.
	   Tension remains high over the killings of five ethnic Albanian
rebels by Serb police on Friday near Opterusa in central Kosovo.
Police described the encounter as a shootout and said Kosovo
Liberation Army guerrillas fired first. But a KLA rebel said the
shootings were a violation of the cease-fire established last
month.
	   Foreign diplomatic observers, accompanied by a visiting U.S.
envoy on war crimes, headed to Malisevo on Monday to look into the
Serb policemen's deaths as well as a reported gunbattle Sunday
night between Serbs and ethnic Albanian rebels in the town. No
injuries were reported in that clash.
	   Serb authorities suspect the killed policemen were kidnapped by
the KLA in retaliation for the shootings of the five guerrillas.
	   Dozens of Serb police are believed to have been killed since the
start of a Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists last
February in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians make up about 90 percent
of the population. Several hundred other people have been killed,
and as many as 300,000 have been driven from their homes.
	   David Scheffer, the U.S. State Department's roving ambassador on
war crimes matters, came to Kosovo on a one-day fact-finding tour
after attending a panel discussion on war crimes in Belgrade.
	   His visit comes amid a continuing controversy over Yugoslav
authorities' failure to cooperate with the United Nations war
crimes panel trying to investigate allegations of atrocities in
Kosovo.
	   Louise Arbour, chief prosecutor for the International War Crimes
Tribunal, and a team of investigators planned a weeklong mission in
Kosovo to begin last Wednesday but were refused access to the
province.
	   Arbour and Scheffer have threatened Yugoslavia with U.N.
sanctions if the authorities continue to defy demands for unlimited
access.
	   ``The person who should be here is Louise Arbour, and she's been
prevented,'' Scheffer told reporters in Pristina, Kosovo's capital.
``It was critical that she be here'' along with the other
investigators, he said.
	   The American envoy, who will report back to Arbour and to U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, said he wanted to visit
destroyed villages and other flashpoints from the war during his
brief tour.
	   He also planned to meet later Monday in Pristina with ethnic
Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova and with a top Serb official.

Michael Jackson settles suit over claim he was disfigured
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Pop star Michael Jackson settled a High Court
action Monday over a British tabloid's articles alleging his face
was disfigured by cosmetic surgery.
	   The Mirror apologized to Jackson for four 1992 articles, with
accompanying photographs, that suggested the singer's surgery had
left him badly scarred.
	   ``The photographs were taken honestly and were not tampered
with, but The Mirror has since met with the plaintiff in person and
acknowledges that the photographs do not accurately represent the
plaintiff's true appearance,'' said Kevin Bays, lawyer for the
publishers and former editor Richard Stott.
	   ``The Mirror wishes, through me, to express its sincere
apologies for the plaintiff's distress which it has caused and is
pleased to have resolved its differences with him,'' Bays said.
	   Jackson's lawyer, Marcus Barclay, told the court that the
tabloid's front-page article contended Jackson was ``hideously
disfigured and visibly scarred as a result of a large number of
cosmetic surgery procedures.''
	   But the litigation had been settled ``amicably'' on confidential
terms, he said.
	   ``The defendants regret the injury which has been done to the
plaintiff's reputation, and have agreed that they will not repeat
these allegations,'' Barclay said.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Talks aimed at rescuing the West Indies cricket
tour of South Africa moved into a fourth day Monday amid signs that
a settlement could be reached in time for the team to fly to
Johannesburg Monday night.
	   As the crisis dragged on, South Africa's cricket board was
forced to call off the first match of the three-month tour _
Tuesday's warmup between the West Indies and an amateur 11 in
Randjiesfontein, near Johannesburg.
	   The opening match _ if the tour goes forward _ now will be in
Soweto on Wednesday against a Gauteng provincial 11. The first Test
is set for Nov. 26.
	   The West Indies players, holding up the tour in a pay dispute,
were scheduled to resume negotiations with West Indian Cricket
Board officials at a hotel near Heathrow Airport.
	   Tentative plans were being made for a news conference Monday
afternoon.
	   Ali Bacher, head of the United Cricket Board of South Africa,
expressed optimism that the tour would go ahead.
	   ``I expect to be returning home tonight and I am sure the West
Indian players will be with me on the plane,'' he said.
	   But WICB president Pat Rousseau, who arrived Sunday for the
talks, indicated the impasse was continuing.
	   ``They (the players) are creating a lot of problems for us,'' he
said.
	   Signs emerged that the talks were entering a crucial phase when
Jimmy Adams, treasurer of the West Indies players' association, and
Brian Lara's agent, Barrie Gill, accompanied by a London lawyer,
arrived at the hotel early Monday afternoon.
	   The crisis began Wednesday when Rousseau fired Lara as captain
and Carl Hooper as vice-captain after they demanded better pay and
conditions for the historic South African tour.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A visiting Irish politician said Monday he
believes Iraq is willing to compromise to head off threatened
military action over suspended U.N. weapons inspections.
	   ``We believe that with good will on both sides, that a
compromise could be worked out,'' Former Irish Prime Minister
Albert Reynolds told reporters.
	   He said he met with Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz,
for more than two hours on Sunday. He described Aziz as ``open''
and ``very flexible.''
	   Reynolds, a member of the Irish Parliament, was credited with
encouraging the Irish Republic Army's 1994 cease-fire. He planned
to leave Iraq later Monday and said he would travel to the United
States on Thursday to confer with American politicians.
	   He appealed to the United States and Britain to abandon threats
of a military strike and to negotiate a settlement.
	   But Britain's Defense Secretary George Robertson on a visit to
Kuwait said the world's patience with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein
is ``draining away.''
	   A diplomatic solution to resolve the crisis is ``still
possible'' but the ``option of force is there, is real,'' Robertson
told reporters in Kuwait where Britain has stationed 12 Tornado
bombers.

Nine die in floods in western Ukraine
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Heavy floods in western Ukraine have killed
nine people, left much of the region badly damaged, and prompted
the country to appeal for international assistance, officials said
Monday.
	   Emergency workers found all the dead bodies in the Zakarpattia
region, which was inundated by last week's heavy rainfalls, the
Emergency Situations Ministry said.
	   Floods and landslides have destroyed about 800 buildings, dozens
of bridges and dams, cut off electricity to more than 100
settlements, and damaged hundreds of kilometers (miles) of roads
and railways, making some remote villages unreachable, the ministry
said.
	   The government has sent appeals to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan and European Commission President Jacques Santer to deliver
humanitarian aid for people who suffered from the floods.
	   Ukrainian embassies in Western nations also have been instructed
to ask these countries for assistance.
	   The floods have covered 118 towns and villages in the region,
injuring about 300 people. More than 24,000 people were temporarily
evacuated, the ministry said.
	   Emergency Situations Minister Valery Kalchenko has sent more
than 8,400 workers to battle the high waters in the Zakarpattia
region.
	   President Leonid Kuchma, who visited the region Friday, ordered
the government to allocate 5 million hryvna (dlrs 1.46 million) for
the relief effort.
	   The Ukrainian Meteorological Center said Monday that heavy rains
in Zakarpattia would continue until Wednesday, but they no longer
threaten to inundate more settlements.
	   The floods have also hit a dozen settlements in the western Lviv
region, but improving weather there allowed officials to fully
resume electricity to most of the flooded villages.

Remains found in Russia may be mass grave of British soldiers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Human remains found in northern Russia may be part
of a mass grave of British soldiers sent to quash the Communist
revolution in 1918, the British Ministry of Defense confirmed
Monday.
	   Discussions are under way between the defense ministry and
Russian officials about investigating the site in a field near
Kandalaksha, spokeswoman Kate O'Connor said.
	   ``There are remains. We don't know the numbers as of yet,'' she
said.
	   Britain was alerted to the grave by a local resident working in
the area, the Guardian newspaper reported Monday.
	   The bodies are thought to be casualties of Britain's contingent
in the international intervention force sent to port cities in 1918
in a covert bid to reverse the Russian revolution, the paper said.
	   An estimated 200,000 Allied soldiers were involved in the
unsuccessful mission.
	   George Pappadopoullos, who leads an army group that works to
identify newly found bodies of British soldiers, told The Guardian
that ``delicate negotiations'' were under way that would allow for
descendants to be traced so they could attend funerals in Russia.

<TEXT>
	   SAO TOME, Sao Tome and Principe (AP) _ The center-left MLSTP/PSD
party shook off criticism of its economic record in the outgoing
coalition government and posted a thumping victory in this tiny
west African nation's general election, according to projected
results Monday.
	   Exit polls showed that the party, which ruled for 16 years under
a single-party Marxist system before the 1991 introduction of
democracy, secured 30 seats in the 55-seat parliament in Sunday's
ballot, state radio reported.
	   The Independent Democratic Alliance, the country's other major
party which is close to President Miguel Trovoada, gained 15 seats
while the smaller Democratic Convergence Party, or PCD, snared 10,
according to the projection.
	   Final results were not expected until Tuesday. The impoverished
country has some 49,600 registered voters in a population of
120,000.
	   The MLSTP/PSD was defeated in the country's first democratic
ballot in 1991 but regained power in 1994 elections.
	   Since 1996, when the government was dissolved following an
aborted military coup, it has governed as the major partner in a
coalition with the PCD.
	   Analysts had expected Trovoada's IDA to win Sunday's vote
because of the outgoing administration's failure to reverse the
twin-island nation's economic slide.
	   The unemployment rate hovers round 45 percent and the average
salary is about dlrs 220 per year, while a pair of shoes costs dlrs
50.
	   However, earlier this year the government entered a joint
venture with U.S. company Environmental Remediation Holding Corp.
to develop the country's oil and gas reserves.
	   Oil exports could provide a major boost to the country's economy
and help pay off a foreign debt estimated at dlrs 300 million.
	   Sao Tome and Principe lies in the Gulf of Guinea _ about 240
kilometers (150 miles) west of Gabon _ in one of the most active
oil exploration areas in the African continent.

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A nuclear reactor was stopped and restarted
in an unscheduled systems check over the weekend at the Zaporizhia
power plant, even though the government had warned against the
practice, officials said Monday.
	   Reactor No. 5 was stopped late Friday and restarted Saturday
evening as part of an unscheduled safety system check, the state
nuclear energy company Energoatom said.
	   The incident at Zaporizhia, Europe's largest nuclear power
plant, occurred just days after First Deputy Energy Minister
Mykhailo Umanets warned that the ministry might have to cut
electricity to some towns if there were any unscheduled reactor
shutdowns.
	   Umanets said the country's power plants can barely produce
enough electricity to meet increasing demand during fall and winter
months as it is.
	   All of Ukraine's energy plants, nuclear facilities among them,
are owed more than dlrs 1 billion by consumers, and are desperately
short of cash needed to buy fuel for the electricity.
	   Ukraine's five nuclear power plants have 14 reactors, which
account for more than 40 percent of the country's electricity
production.
	   Five reactors were undergoing scheduled repairs as of Monday,
Energoatom said.

Chinese workers surround government office to protest sell-off
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 8 grafs to UPDATE with report of farmers' protest &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Workers from a state-run cement factory
surrounded government offices in central China for five days to
protest a plan to privatize their plant, a rights group reported
Monday.
	   All 600 workers at the Luoyang Cement Products Factory fear a
cheap sale of both state assets and their future, the New
York-based Human Rights in China reported.
	   About 200 workers besieged city government offices in Luoyang,
in Henan province, from Monday to Friday last week demanding that
approval of the sale to a private company be reversed, the group
said.
	   Confirming the demonstrations, an official in charge of economic
planning for Luoyang said the protesters dispersed after the
government pledged to look into the workers' concerns.
	   No one was arrested or hurt, said the official with the city's
Economic and Trade Commission, who only gave his surname, Pan.
	   Separately, a Hong Kong-based human rights group reported Monday
that several hundred farmers armed with poles protested outside
government offices in southwest China because police detained a
village representative who was preparing to travel to Beijing to
complain to authorities about high taxes.
	   An official who tried to flee the building by jumping from a
window fell to his death, and farmers beat police reinforcements
sent in the next day, the Information Center of Human Rights and
Democratic Movement in China said.
	   On Oct. 23, two days after the protest erupted, authorities sent
200 riot police to the village in Sichuan province to quell the
protesters, the group said. At least 30 farmers were arrested, it
said.
	   Small-scale demonstrations have become almost daily occurrences
in many Chinese cities as workers, the unemployed, farmers and
pensioners feel they are losing out to market reforms and being
abandoned by an indifferent or corrupt officialdom.
	   The contentious sale of the Luoyang cement factory underscores
the dangers facing Beijing a year into its ambitious three-year
plan to reform the largely inefficient, virtually bankrupt state
sector.
	   Local officials have been quick to sell the best state assets,
in some cases steering them to cronies. Unrest among workers _ long
used to the cradle-to-grave services of central planning _ has
sharpened.
	   Human Rights in China said the protesters believed that the
privatization plan would leave them without jobs and pensions. They
also contended that the plant was one of the city's top 100
taxpayers as recently as 1996, with 200 million yuan (dlrs 24.2
million) in assets.
	   But the city agreed to sell the factory for 2 million yuan (dlrs
242,000) to the private Zhongtai Company, Human Rights in China
said.
	   Mr. Pan of the Luoyang Economic and Trade Commission said the
sale will be put on hold until all concerns are settled.

 &UR; Britain: Patience with Saddam ebbing, option of force real &QL; 
 &UR; By DIANA ELIAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Visiting British Defense Secretary George
Robertson said on Monday that patience with Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein is ``draining away'' over his refusal to allow U.N. weapons
inspections.
	   A diplomatic solution to resolve the crisis is ``still
possible'' but the ``option of force is there, is real,'' Robertson
told reporters at the end of a day long visit.
	   Robertson said his Kuwait visit should ``give a message that
should go directly to Baghdad: do not underestimate the resolution
of the international community.''
	   ``We mean it. And the international community is united,'' he
told reporters at the Ali al-Salem air base, standing beneath the
wing of a Tornado bomber.
	   The aircraft is among the 12 GR1 Tornadoes based in Kuwait and
serviced by 400 Royal Air Force personnel. Britain also has two
frigates, HMS Grafton and HMS Cumberland, in the Gulf waters.
	   Britain and the United States have not ruled out military
strikes on Iraq to retaliate for its Oct. 31 decision to halt all
work by the United Nations Special Commission, which oversees the
dismantling of Iraq's chemical and biological weapons program and
long range missiles.
	   Baghdad says the disarmament work cannot resume until the U.N.
Security Council gives a timetable for lifting the economic
sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which had
sparked the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Robertson called the inspections crisis, Saddam's ``most serious
confrontation with the international community since the end of the
Gulf War.''
	   But ``if Saddam thinks he can drag this out he makes a serious
miscalculation,'' he said following talks with the Kuwaiti leaders.
	   ``Patience is draining away and the option of force is still
there,'' he said.
	   ``We stand resolved with Kuwait and with other countries of this
region and internationally to make sure that he (Saddam) does
comply with the demands of the international community,'' he said.
	   Robertson later left for Bahrain.

 &UR; Barak in Jordan to discuss Mideast peacemaking

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Israeli opposition leader Ehud Barak on
Monday discussed with Crown Prince Hassan the delay in implementing
the latest peace accords between Israel and the Palestinians.
	   Ehud Barak's visit _ the second since July 14 _ comes one day
after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu indefinitely
postponed a Cabinet debate on the ratification of the Wye River
memorandum following Friday's bomb attack in west Jerusalem.
	   The Wye deal signed at a White House ceremony on Oct. 23 calls
on Israel to cede more West Bank lands to the Palestinians in
return for security guarantees.
	   Barak, the head of Israel's left-leaning Labor Party, is
accompanied by party members, Eitan Kabel and Yossi Katz. All three
are members are Israeli Parliament.
	   Barak briefed Hassan on his party's stand on the Wye deal,
officials said in exchange for anonymity. They declined to provide
other details.
	   Hassan is King Hussein's brother who is acting as regent while
the king is receiving cancer treatment in the United States. Both
Hussein and Hassan have hosted several Israeli political groups to
articulate Jordan's peace perspective to the Israeli public
opinion.
	   Information Minister Nasser Judeh told reporters that Barak's
visit is ``part of the continued dialogue between the government of
Jordan and the body politic in Israel out of concern for national
Arab interests.''
	   Jordan, which signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, is also
actively engaged in persuading Israel's right wing-led government
to reach a settlement with the Palestinians. King Hussein was
instrumental in brokering the Wye deal.
	   Jordan is eager for a swift settlement to the Palestinian
conflict to ease opposition among its predominantly Palestinian
population to its own peace treaty with Israel.
	   Barak was expected to return home later in the day.

Portuguese privatization raises dlrs 797 million
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ The government Monday raised 136 billion
escudos (dlrs 797 million) through the privatization of a 31
percent stake in the national highway operator Brisa _
Auto-Estradas de Portugal.
	   The share issue, which was the last major sell-off of the year,
brought total revenue for privatizations in 1998 to some 785
billion escudos (dlrs 4.5 billion).
	   ``Once again the strength of the Portuguese capital market has
been demonstrated by a highly successful share offer, this time in
particularly difficult international market conditions,'' the
Secretary of State for Finances, Fernando Teixeira dos Santos,
said.
	   The revenue goes mostly to paying off the public debt which the
government estimates will fall to 58 percent of Gross Domestic
Product this year, down from 61.5 percent last year.

 &UR; Iran to complain about U.S.-radio at the Hague tribunal

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran will protest to the International Court
of Justice at the Hague and other global bodies about the
U.S.-funded Radio Free Europe, the Iran Daily reported Monday.
	   It quoted Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi as saying the radio
``was set up to interfere in Iran's internal affairs.''
	   It did not say when the complaints will be filed. The
English-language daily also did not say which organizations Iran
will approach besides the ICJ in the Netherlands.
	   On Tuesday, Iran recalled its ambassador from Prague to protest
the Czech government's assistance to the radio and said it would
reduce the level of its economic and political cooperation with
Prague.
	   The American-sponsored station also began broadcasts directed to
Iraq on Friday. In a trial period of several weeks, the station
will broadcast one 30-minute program a day to Iran and Iraq.
	   The Farsi-language service to Iran was approved by the Czech
government in August.
	   Radio Free Europe began transmitting from Munich, Germany, in
1951, spreading uncensored news to Soviet-controlled countries
behind the Iron Curtain during the Cold War between the West and
the Communist East.
	   It moved its headquarters to Prague in 1995 following the
collapse of communism six years earlier.

Britain: Patience with Saddam ebbing, option of force real
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Patience with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein is
``draining away'' over his refusal to allow U.N. weapons
inspections, visiting British Defense Secretary George Robertson
said Monday.
	   A diplomatic solution to resolve the crisis is ``still
possible'' but the ``option of force is there, is real,'' Robertson
told reporters at the end of a daylong visit.
	   Robertson said his Kuwait visit should ``give a message that
should go directly to Baghdad: do not underestimate the resolution
of the international community.''
	   ``We mean it. And the international community is united,'' he
told reporters at the Ali al-Salem air base, standing beneath the
wing of a Tornado bomber.
	   The aircraft is among the 12 GR1 Tornadoes based in Kuwait and
serviced by 400 Royal Air Force personnel. Britain also has two
frigates, HMS Grafton and HMS Cumberland, in the Gulf waters.
	   Britain and the United States have not ruled out military
strikes on Iraq to retaliate for its Oct. 31 decision to halt all
work by the U.N. Special Commission, which oversees the dismantling
of Iraq's chemical and biological weapons program and long-range
missiles. Iraq is required to eliminate its weapons of mass
destruction before U.N. sanctions can be lifted.
	   Baghdad says the disarmament work cannot resume until the U.N.
Security Council gives a timetable for lifting the economic
sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which had
sparked the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Robertson called the inspections crisis, Saddam's ``most serious
confrontation with the international community since the end of the
Gulf War.''
	   But ``if Saddam thinks he can drag this out, he makes a serious
miscalculation,'' he said after talks with the Kuwaiti leaders.
	   ``Patience is draining away and the option of force is still
there,'' he said.
	   ``We stand resolved with Kuwait and with other countries of this
region and internationally to make sure that he (Saddam) does
comply with the demands of the international community,'' he said.
	   Robertson later left for Bahrain.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The bodies of two Serb policemen
were found in central Kosovo on Monday, Serb officials said, in the
latest evidence a month-old cease-fire in the troubled province is
coming under increasing strain.
	   The policemen, who went missing last Friday, were found by a
police patrol near Malisevo. Initial findings indicated they had
been shot at close range, the Serb Media Center said.
	   The report comes with scattered violence on the upswing in
Kosovo, four weeks after the agreement between Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. negotiator Richard Holbrooke aimed at
halting the conflict.
	   Tension remains high over the killings of five ethnic Albanian
rebels by Serb police on Friday near Opterusa in central Kosovo.
Police described the encounter as a shootout and said Kosovo
Liberation Army guerrillas fired first. But a KLA rebel said the
shootings were a violation of the cease-fire established last
month.
	   Foreign diplomatic observers, accompanied by a visiting U.S.
envoy on war crimes, headed to Malisevo on Monday to look into the
Serb policemen's deaths as well as a reported gunbattle Sunday
night between Serbs and ethnic Albanian rebels in the town. No
injuries were reported in that clash.
	   Serb authorities suspect the killed policemen were kidnapped by
the KLA in retaliation for the shootings of the five guerrillas.
	   Dozens of Serb police are believed to have been killed since the
start of a Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists last
February in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians make up about 90 percent
of the population. Several hundred other people have been killed,
and as many as 300,000 have been driven from their homes.
	   David Scheffer, the U.S. State Department's roving ambassador on
war crimes matters, came to Kosovo on a one-day fact-finding tour
after attending a panel discussion on war crimes in Belgrade.
	   His visit comes amid a continuing controversy over Yugoslav
authorities' failure to cooperate with the United Nations war
crimes panel trying to investigate allegations of atrocities in
Kosovo.
	   Louise Arbour, chief prosecutor for the International War Crimes
Tribunal, and a team of investigators planned a weeklong mission in
Kosovo to begin last Wednesday but were refused access to the
province.
	   Arbour and Scheffer have threatened Yugoslavia with U.N.
sanctions if the authorities continue to defy demands for unlimited
access.
	   ``The person who should be here is Louise Arbour, and she's been
prevented,'' Scheffer told reporters in Pristina, Kosovo's capital.
``It was critical that she be here'' along with the other
investigators, he said.
	   The American envoy, who will report back to Arbour and to U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, said he wanted to visit
destroyed villages and other flashpoints from the war during his
brief tour.
	   He also planned to meet later Monday in Pristina with ethnic
Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova and with a top Serb official.

Two armed conscripts flee army unit in Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Two Ukrainian soldiers have fled their army
units after stealing automatic rifles, a news agency said Monday.
	   Two unidentified 19-year-old soldiers deserted their military
garrison in the northeastern city of Sumy early Sunday after
stealing two Kalashnikov rifles, two bayonets and four empty
magazines, the independent UNIAN news agency said.
	   The report did not say if the stolen guns were loaded.
	   Cases of conscripts fleeing from the Ukrainian armed forces,
like those in neighboring Russia and other former Soviet republics,
have become frequent recently.
	   The Ukrainian army, hit by the country's continuing economic
decline, suffers from poor living conditions, chronic shortages of
funds and supplies, and hazings inflicted on young conscripts by
older soldiers.
	   Many young Ukrainians are evading military service, hampering
the Defense Ministry's efforts to recruit the required number of
soldiers.

Cambodian opposition insists on concession from Hun Sen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's leading opposition party
warned Monday that a three-month stalemate over the formation of a
new government would likely continue unless strongman Hun Sen's
party made significant concessions.
	   The statement from Prince Norodom Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party
came as momentum gathered for King Norodom Sihanouk to serve as
host for a new round of top-level talks to end the deadlock.
	   Hun Sen's party won a slight majority in the July election, but
needs FUNCINPEC's cooperation to attain the two-thirds vote in
parliament necessary to approve a new government.
	   Ranariddh and his ally, Sam Rainsy, alleging election fraud and
intimidation by Hun Sen, led an exodus of opposition lawmakers from
Cambodia after the ceremonial convening of parliament Sept. 24.
	   FUNCINPEC said in its statement Monday that the party is
prepared to make a contribution to break the stalemate, but ``a
solution can only be realized if all parties accept to make a
concession like FUNCINPEC did in 1993 when it was the election
winner.''
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party threatened a resumption of
the nation's decades-long civil war if it couldn't share power
after losing the U.N.-sponsored 1993 polls.
	   In an agreement brokered by Sihanouk, FUNCINPEC agreed to share
the premiership and key ministries with Hun Sen and conceded the
presidency of parliament to his party.
	   The shaky coalition unraveled in 1997 when Hun Sen ousted
Ranariddh as his co-prime minister in a violent coup.
	   Although FUNCINPEC mentioned no specific concession in its
statement, it had demanded earlier that it should be given the
presidency of the parliament.
	   Responding to international hopes that the king can again lead
the quarreling parties to compromise, Sihanouk has offered to play
host to another round of talks inside Cambodia or in Beijing, where
he maintains a residence.
	   Hun Sen has insisted the talks be held on Cambodian soil. The
king, in response to opposition demands, has agreed to provide
royal protection to his son Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy if they
return.
	   There has been no formal response from the prince to the king's
initiative, but Sam Rainsy's party indicated Monday it would not
take part in a summit held inside Cambodia.
	   ``We would prefer that a summit take place in Beijing where all
parties can discuss the issues (of crisis) without fear of
coercion,'' the statement said.
	   King Sihanouk, 76, is scheduled to leave Cambodia Saturday for
an extended stay in Beijing for medical treatment.

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Ciba Specialty Chemicals AG and
Clariant announced Monday they would merge to form a chemicals
giant with a yearly turnover of 18 billion Swiss francs (dlrs 13
billion).
	   The merger between the two Swiss based firms, worth 20.1 billion
francs (dlrs 14.5 billion), will produce the world's biggest
company making speciality chemicals and dyes.
	   Some 3,000 jobs of the total 55,000 worldwide will be lost in
the process. It is hoped to save about 600 million francs (dlrs 444
million) per year through rationalization, a statement said.
	   The merger will take the form of a share swap. Ciba shareholders
will receive 46 percent of the shares and Clariant shareholders 54
percent.
	   The new company will be called Clariant. Its logo will be the
butterfly which was Ciba's trademark.
	   Ciba Specialty Chemicals was a spin-off from Ciba Geigy.
Clariant used to be part of Sandoz until it was separated out in
1995. The two former parent companies merged in 1996 to form the
drug group Novartis.
	   The new company president will be Rolf Schweizer, current
Clariant president. Vice President and Chief Executive Officer will
be Rolf Meyer, the Ciba Speciality Chemicals President.
	   The announcement said that Germany's Hoechst would retain its 45
percent stake in Clariant until completion of the merger. This
would then be reduced proportionately.
	   The merger is subject to approval from regulatory authorities.
	   Swiss approval is expected in January, said Patrick Ducrey, the
deputy head of Switzerland's competition comission.
	   ``The merger shouldn't really pose any problems,'' he added.

Israeli air attack after guerrilla ambush in South Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes fired at least one
missile on suspected guerrilla bases in southern Lebanon Monday,
Lebanese security officials said.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the afternoon
raid on a valley between the Shiite Muslim villages of Yater and
Jebal al-Boutom.
	   The area, around 15 kilometers (nine miles) south of the port
city of Tyre, is often used by Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas
to launch attacks on Israeli troops occupying a border enclave in
South Lebanon.
	   The attack came after Hezbollah guerrillas ambushed an Israeli
outpost at Blatt, some three kilometers (2 miles) north of the
Israeli border, the officials said. They spoke on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   A Hezbollah statement said the mortar attack caused ``definite
casualties.'' There was no immediate word from Israel on the
guerrilla attack or the Israeli air raid.
	   On Sunday, Israeli helicopters and artillery fired on suspected
guerrilla hideouts after Lebanese guerrillas attacked
Israeli-backed militiamen in the south.
	   Hezbollah leads a guerrilla warfare to oust some 1,500 Israeli
forces and 2,500 allied Lebanese militiamen from the enclave, which
Israel established in 1985 to guard against cross-border guerrilla
attacks.

 &UR; Iran to complain about U.S.-radio at the Hague tribunal

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran will protest to the International Court
of Justice at the Hague and other global bodies about the
U.S.-funded Radio Free Europe, the Iran Daily reported Monday.
	   It quoted Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi as saying the radio
``was set up to interfere in Iran's internal affairs.''
	   It did not say when the complaints will be filed. The
English-language daily also did not say which organizations Iran
will approach besides the ICJ in the Netherlands.
	   On Tuesday, Iran recalled its ambassador from Prague to protest
the Czech government's assistance to the radio and said it would
reduce the level of its economic and political cooperation with
Prague.
	   The American-sponsored station also began broadcasts directed to
Iraq on Friday. In a trial period of several weeks, the station
will broadcast one 30-minute program a day to Iran and Iraq.
	   The Farsi-language service to Iran was approved by the Czech
government in August.
	   Radio Free Europe began transmitting from Munich, Germany, in
1951, spreading uncensored news to Soviet-controlled countries
behind the Iron Curtain during the Cold War between the West and
the Communist East.
	   It moved its headquarters to Prague in 1995 following the
collapse of communism six years earlier.

of increasing strain in a month-old cease-fire in the restive

Simoni stays on as Inter coach
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Following a draw which halted a three-game losing
streak in Italy's first division, Inter Coach Luigi Simoni looked
likely Monday to keep his job.
	   ``Simoni is our coach, he's doing a good job. We should just let
him work,'' the team's President Massimo Moratti was quoted as
saying by Monday's Gazzetta dello Sport.
	   Simoni has received several ultimatums during his rocky one-plus
seasons at the helm of Internazionale of Milan.
	   The last one came on Nov. 1, when Moratti said Simoni's future
depended on the results of a Champions League match in Moscow and
on Sunday's derby against cross-city rival AC Milan.
	   Inter drew both matches. It is now only 11th in Italy's 18-team
standings.
	   Touted at the start of the season as a title contender, Inter
has struggled with an inconsistent defense and injuries to star
strikers Ronaldo and Roberto Baggio.
	   Its roster include several other expensive international stars
such as World Champion Youri Djorkaeff of France, Argentina's Diego
Simeone and Nigerian Taribo West.

Arrest of suspected Israeli spies prompts Israeli assurances

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) - Israel assured Cyprus of its continuing
friendship Monday after two Israelis were arrested on suspicion of
spying for the Greek Cypriot government's archenemy, Turkey.
	   Israeli President Ezer Weizman sent his Cypriot counterpart,
Glafcos Clerides, ``a message of friendship, of continuation of
what we achieved during Weizman's visit, upgrading the relations,''
Israeli Ambassador Shemi Tzur told reporters.
	   Saturday's arrest of the two Israelis came three days after
Weizman visited Nicosia and assured Clerides that Israel's military
accord with Turkey was not aimed at Cyprus.
	   The arrest caused a strain in relations _ newly repaired by the
first visit of an Israeli president to Cyprus _ but both countries
acted quickly to head off permanent damage.
	   ``We do hope that this cloud which appeared this last weekend
will leave us and we will continue our good relations,'' Tzur said
as he left Clerides' office with Ariel Shumer, the director-general
of Weizman's office who delivered the message.
	   On Cyprus' part, a statement by the Justice Ministry on Sunday
evening said that nothing had transpired yet to link the two
arrested men to Israel's government.
	   But other officials pointed out that the two men _ identified as
Udi Hargov, 27, and Igal Damary, 47 _ would not be freed until
after a thorough investigation.
	   Israel has not denied the men worked for its Mossad intelligence
agency. Asked Sunday if they were Israeli agents, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said ``every Israeli citizen is important to us.
We'll clarify this, and of course we'll bring them home.''
	   The two Israelis were seized in an apartment in the fishing
village of Ziyi, halfway between the coastal cities of Larnaca and
Limassol. They appeared in court and were ordered held for eight
days for a police investigation.
	   A police statement said that the two were suspected of spying on
the Cypriot National Guard and that cameras, recording of police
radio messages, radio scanners and maps were found in the
apartment.
	   Police officials said privately that the Israelis probably were
gathering information for Turkey, which maintains 35,000 troops in
the Turkish-occupied northern third of the island.
	   On Monday, Cypriot dailies and radio stations criticized the
Justice Ministry statement saying no connection had yet been found
to Israel's government.
	   This prompted a series of clarifying remarks by various Cypriot
officials.
	   Justice Minister Nicos Koshis said ``the two will not be
released or deported before a thorough investigation,'' and
government spokesman Christos Stylianides noted the ministry's
statement referred to the investigation ``until that moment, and
does not rule out anything.''
	   Defense Minister Yiannakis Omirou said ``Cyprus is concerned by
the military alliance between Israel and Turkey which includes the
exchange of information. If the two arrested Israelis are Mossad
agents, this will create a grave political issue and have serious
repercussions.''

Nazi war crimes trial put off again because of defendant's illness

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) - The judge in the trial of alleged Nazi
war criminal Aleksandras Lileikis suspended the proceedings
indefinitely on Monday because Lileikis is too sick to appear in
court.
	   Lileikis, 91, appeared briefly in court last Thursday in a
wheelchair, but was rushed away in an ambulance after complaining
of shortness of breath. The judge on Monday said a doctors' report
showed Lileikis is suffering from serious coronary disease and
would be unable to leave the hospital for several weeks.
	   Lileikis is charged with genocide for allegedly ordering scores
of Jews turned over to a Nazi execution squad when he was chief of
the Vilnius security police during the 1941-44 Nazi occupation.
	   The trial was to have begun in September, but was postponed
after doctors said Lileikis was too ill to come to court.
Lithuanian law does not allow trial in absentia for medical
reasons.
	   A medical panel appointed by the court to examine Lileikis at
that time confirmed that he is in poor health, but said he was
capable of appearing in court.
	   The repeated delays in getting the trial under way has angered
critics who claim that Lithuanian authorities have not pushed for a
speedy trial, perhaps hoping that Lileikis would die.
	   A trial would draw new attention to a severely painful period of
Lithuania's history. About 90 percent of Lithuania's pre-war Jewish
population of 240,000 died during the war years.
	   Lileikis emigrated to the United States and lived in Norwood,
Massachusetts, where he worked for a Lithuanian publishing house.
He returned to Lithuania in 1996 as the United States was moving to
revoke his citizenship on the grounds that he lied about his
background when he emigrated.
	   Lileikis' lawyer, Algirdas Matuiza, applauded the court's Monday
ruling.
	   ``This is obviously a question of a man's health,'' he said.
``They can't try him in absentia, so they have to wait until he's
in good shape.But this will definitely take time, at least until
next year.''

Balkan neighbors to strenghten military cooperation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ A senior Turkish government official
called Monday for closer military cooperation with neighboring
Bulgaria.
	   After talks with President Petar Stoyanov at the end of his
four-day visit, Turkish Deputy Premier and National Defense
Minister Ismet Sezgin expressed satisfaction with the progress of
bilateral relations and the hope that Bulgarian-Turkish military
cooperation will be promoted.
	   Relations between the two Balkan countries suffered badly after
the communist regime in Bulgaria forced the one million members of
the ethnic Turkish minority to change their names and deprived them
of the rights to use their language, religion and customs.
	   After visiting several military plants, Sezgin noted that great
efforts are being made by Bulgaria to bring their output into
conformity with NATO standards.
	   ``Representatives of the Turkish military-industrial complex are
expected in Bulgaria within ten days. They will get familiar on the
spot with the capabilities of the Bulgarian defense industry with a
view to continued bilateral cooperation in military technology,''
Sezgin was quoted by the state news agency BTA as saying.
	   While part of the former Soviet bloc, Bulgaria developed a
respected arms industry, known for its quality small arms,
anti-tank and anti-aircraft rockets, artillery systems, armored
vehicles and electronics.
	   Since the end of the Cold War in 1989, the defense industry has
been largely idled, piling up debts as it lost its traditional
markets in the former Soviet bloc and the Middle East.
	   Turkey, a NATO member country, is viewed by neighboring Bulgaria
as a partner that could back its aspirations to join the pact.

Islamic experts press for understanding on human rights issues

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Islamic scholars Monday defended their religion's
human-rights record before a special United Nations forum aimed at
improving respect for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
	   ``There are still some circles in the West, acting out of their
own vested interests, who still persist on perpetuating fears and
arousing suspicion about Islam,'' said Kamel Al-Sharif of Jordan,
secretary-general of an Islamic relief organization.
	   Critics of the religion have been organizing anti-Islamic
campaigns which portrayed a false image of the religion, al-Sharif
said.
	   ``It is not strange for the Arabs and Muslims to support the
International Declaration of Human Rights because they can find in
it a collection of supreme humanitarian principles which are
compatible with their faith and traditions,'' he said.
	   Al-Sharif was one of 20 authorities on Islamic law invited to
speak at the two-day event, organized by Mary Robinson, U.N. high
commissioner for human rights, at the suggestion of Iran.
	   In her keynote speech, Mrs. Robinson said Islam, which is the
religion of a fifth of the people on the planet, had ``the dignity
of the human person, tolerance and equity at the core of its
message.''
	   Apart from Mrs. Robinson, all the speakers were Muslims.
Human-rights organizations have complained that they are barred
from asking questions or commenting at the seminar.
	   Ahmad Kamal Abdoumagd, professor of public law at the University
of Cairo, told the seminar that no country entirely lived up to
what was stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, now
in its 50th anniversary year.
	   ``This is nothing particular to Islam. It is everywhere,'' said
Abdoumagd.
	   ``Else how can we understand that in a highly developed country
like the United States racial discrimination and other forms of
discrimination continue to survive?''
	   Abdoumagd also attacked Muslims and non-Muslims who called for
the rejection of the Islamic Shariah legal code as the only way to
ensure human rights, saying the suggestion lacked ``cultural
legitimacy.''
	   ``No Muslim would accept a solution that doesn't stem internally
from his culture,' he said.
	   The idea for the seminar was born when Mrs. Robinson visited
Iran in February. The Iranians suggested a scholarly event to try
to bring together Islamic culture and the rights declaration.
	   Human rights organizations have accused Iran and some other
countries in the Muslim world of systematic abuses that include
extrajudicial killings, torture and harsh prison conditions.
	   The event has been put together in conjunction with the
Organization of the Islamic Conference, which has 52 member
countries.
	   ``We are hoping it will be the start of a process,'' said human
rights official John Pace.
	   ``The purpose is to remove or help to remove certain levels of
ignorance of values and customs.''

U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson arrives in Taiwan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo TPE101 &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson
arrived Monday for trade talks in a rare visit to Taiwan by an
American Cabinet official that has already raised protests from
China.
	   ``I'm looking forward to opportunities to reaffirm and
strengthen the longstanding friendship between Americans and the
people of Taiwan,'' Richardson said in an arrival statement.
	   His visit is considered an attempt by Washington to ease
Taiwanese feelings of insecurity following statements by President
Bill Clinton in China this summer that badly rattled Taiwan.
	   Richardson was to meet Taiwanese officials before addressing an
annual joint U.S.-Taiwan business conference Tuesday. He is also
expected to meet with Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui before leaving
Wednesday.
	   Richardson said his presence at the business conference
``reflects the strength of economic and commercial relations
between the U.S. and Taiwan.''
	   Participants will hold workshop discussions on exchanges in
fields including telecommunications, infrastructure, venture
capital and biotechnology.
	   Clinton's strong reiteration that Washington would not back
Taiwan's attempts to assert itself internationally was seen here as
a concession to China that would encourage Beijing to isolate the
island it considers a renegade province.
	   Taiwanese officials have called for reassurances that
Washington's support remains. Media here said Richardson's
background as a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and a
close White House confidant make his presence particularly
significant.
	   China has protested the visit, labeling it an official contact
that violates agreements between China and the United States.
China's Foreign Ministry warned last week of possible damage to the
``hard-won development in China-U.S. ties.''
	   A similar visit by then-U.S. Transportation Secretary Federico
Pena in 1994 prompted China to cancel Pena's planned visit to
Beijing.
	   Visits by U.S. Cabinet officials to Taiwan have been few and far
between since the Carter administration severed diplomatic ties in
1979 to allow it to establish relations with China. Richardson's is
the first such visit since Philip Lader, then head of the Small
Business Administration, came in 1996.
	   The United States revised its policy in 1994 to allow regular
visits to Taiwan by officials in technical and economic fields, but
concern over harming Chinese sensitivities has kept such trips to a
minimum. U.S. businesses here had argued they were losing contracts
to European competitors whose governments were more willing to send
officials to lobby for deals.
	   The United States, Taiwan's largest trading partner, receives 23
percent of the island's exports and accounts for 20 percent of its
imports. Two-way trade topped U.S. dlrs 52 billion in 1997.

EU seeks WTO consultations on Argentina leather trade
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union said Monday it was
taking its complaints against Argentina for alleged restrictions on
leather trade to the World Trade Organization.
	   In a statement, the European Commission said its investigations
revealed Argentina had erected ``trade barriers which conflict with
WTO rules.'' The EU executive body said these included an effective
ban on the export of raw hides and discriminatory taxes on leather
imports.
	   Following fruitless bilateral talks with Argentina, the
Commission said it had requested consultations at the Geneva-based
WTO that should start mid-December.
	   If the consultation procedure fails to find a solution, either
part can request that the WTO set up a panel to rule on the
dispute.
	   The Commission took up the case after complaints from European
producers.

EU warns U.S. against imposing sanctions over banana imports
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING FOR ALL NEEDING &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union warned the United
States Monday not to impose trade sanctions to counter the EU's
banana import regime, adding Washington would face ``extremely
damaging consequences.''
	   The warning followed weekend threats from the United States that
punitive action may be taken if the 15-nation EU does not change
its banana trade system, which Washington claims unfairly favors
imports from former European colonies.
	   ``If the U.S. goes down the unilateral road, we believe it would
have extremely damaging consequences'' for the transatlantic
relationship, said EU foreign trade spokesman Nigel Gardner.
	   Last month, the U.S. administration outlined possible
retaliation against the European Union if the EU defies a rulings
by the World Trade Organization on the international banana trade.
	   The London Financial Times said Monday Washington would issue a
preliminary list of EU products this week on which the United
States will impose sanctions to retaliate against the banana import
regime.
	   If Washington goes ahead with the move, EU countries are
expected to respond in kind, raising the specter of a transatlantic
trade war, EU officials said.
	   The United States is unhappy with the EU's efforts so far to
respond to last year's negative WTO ruling on the banana regime,
which grants favorable treatment to a number of African, Caribbean,
and Pacific region countries.
	   The WTO suit championed banana growers in Latin America who felt
discriminated by the regime.
	   The EU approved new import regulations in an attempt to remedy
the situation and bring it into line with WTO regulations. But the
United States and Latin Americans claim it is still discriminatory.

	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Two Saudi army helicopters collided
and crashed in eastern Saudi Arabia, and the four occupants,
including one French pilot, parachuted to safety, a newspaper

Muslims mark anniversary of destruction of Mostar's Old Bridge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSTAR, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Hundreds of children from
primary schools in Muslim-dominated eastern Mostar cast flowers
Monday into the Neretva River, marking the fifth anniversary of the
destruction of the city's famous Old Bridge.
	   The gorgeous 430-year-old, one-span bridge _ long considered a
cultural monument _ was under the protection of UNESCO when it was
destroyed in 1993 by Bosnian Croat artillery during the conflict
between Bosnia's Muslims and Croats.
	   The United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural
Organization tracks and helps protect so-called ``Heritage Sites''
around the world.
	   Bridge reconstruction started earlier this year, and local
officials say the effort will cost approximately 14 million
dollars.
	   The World Bank has already provided some 4 million dollars. The
rest of the money has been pledged by several countries, including
the United States, Germany, Italy, Spain and Turkey.
	   Reconstruction work will last several years. So far, some 60
percent of the original building materials have been recovered from
the river.
	   Initially allies against Bosnian Serbs, the Croats and Muslims
turned against each other and spent a year fighting for domination
in central and southern Bosnia.
	   Since the Dayton peace accord stopped the fighting in late 1995,
Bosnian Croats and Muslims share one of the two country's
substates, the Muslim-Croat federation.
	   Hard-liners on both sides continue following their nationalist
goals. Towns like Mostar, where Bosnian Croats and Muslims fought
for control during the war, remain divided.

	   BERLIN (AP) _ A memorial commemorating the mass deportation of
Berlin's Jews to concentration camps was found defaced with
swastikas Monday, the 60th anniversary of the Kristallnacht pogrom.
	   Three small swastikas were scratched around a Star of David on
the metal monument, which was erected on a railway bridge in 1987
and has been damaged several times since then.
	   It was not known exactly when the latest vandalism occurred,
police said.
	   Swastikas and neo-Nazi graffiti was also discovered Monday
sprayed on walls in the eastern city of Schwerin, north of Berlin,
police said.
	   And just south of Berlin in Potsdam, police reported a stone was
thrown through a window of a house on the grounds of a Jewish
cemetery early Monday.
	   Police said it was unclear whether the damage was related to the
anniversary of the Nov. 9, 1938 ``Night of Broken Glass,'' when
Nazi storm troopers led attacks on synagogues, Jewish businesses
and homes across Germany and Austria.

Irish politician tries to mediate in Iraq crisis

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A visiting Irish politician said Monday he
believes Iraq is willing to compromise to head off threatened
military action over suspended U.N. weapons inspections, but
Britain's defense secretary says time was running out.
	   Iraq announced on Oct. 31 that it was halting cooperation with
international inspectors until the Security Council begins moving
to lift the sanctions imposed to punish Iraq for its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait. The devastating sanctions, which ban the sale of oil and
other financial dealings, can only be lifted once inspectors
certify that Iraq has destroyed its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Former Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds appealed to the
United States and Britain to abandon threats of a military strike
and to negotiate a settlement.
	   ``We believe that with good will on both sides, that a
compromise could be worked out,'' he said.
	   Reynolds, a member of the Irish Parliament, was credited with
encouraging the Irish Republic Army's 1994 cease-fire. He planned
to leave Iraq later Monday and said he would travel to the United
States on Thursday to confer with American politicians.
	   But Britain's Defense Secretary George Robertson on a visit to
Kuwait said the world's patience with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein
is ``draining away.''
	   A diplomatic solution to resolve the crisis is ``still
possible'' but the ``option of force is there, is real,'' Robertson
told reporters in Kuwait where Britain has stationed 12 Tornado
bombers.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton met Sunday with top security
advisers, but put off a decision on whether to use force against
Iraq to reopen military sites to U.N. inspectors.
	   Reynolds said he met with Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq
Aziz, for more than two hours on Sunday. He described Aziz as
``open'' and ``very flexible.''
	   Reynolds said: ``Today I would like to send a very clear message
and a clear call to the United Nations, to President Clinton and to
(British) Prime Minister Tony Blair that whatever (their feelings)
about the conflict, that everybody gets around the table to
dialogue and debate and talk to remove the sanctions.''
	   He suggested that the United Nations lift sanctions on medicine
to let supplies into Iraq.
	   ``I think there would be a corresponding response from Tariq
Aziz and the Iraqi government'' to such a goodwill gesture, he
said.
	   ``Nobody wants to see a resumption of a conflict that has such
horrendous repercussions on the people of Iraq and on the children
that are suffering most of all,'' Reynolds said.
	   Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh said Sunday that Iraq
did not fear a military strike.
	   ``They will not kill in a military strike more than they are
killing with sanctions every day,'' he said.
	   Also Monday, five more inspectors from the U.N. Special
Commission _ which is responsible for elimination of Iraq's
chemical and biological weapons as well as long-range missiles _
left the country.
	   Caroline Cross, UNSCOM spokeswoman in Baghdad, said 10 more
inspectors are to depart Wednesday, which will raise the total to
30 since UNSCOM began the partial pull out Saturday.
	   She noted that more than 100 U.N. weapons staffers remain in the
country and could resume inspections immediately if Iraq changes it
positions.
	   Although Iraq halted UNSCOM's work, it exempted monitors from
the Vienna-headquartered International Atomic Energy Agency. Two
IAEA teams went into the field on Monday, as they have on most days
this month. They were accompanied by UNSCOM technicians who were
collecting samples from air sensors, Ms. Cross said.

	   BERLIN (AP) _ Warnings against a resurgent anti-Semitism colored
ceremonies Monday marking the 60th anniversary of Kristallnacht _
or ``Night of Broken Glass'' _ when the Holocaust began with Nazi
storm troopers burning and ransacking Jewish businesses and
synagogues.
	   Ignatz Bubis, the leader of Germany's Jews, noted with alarm
that ideas once considered extremist have become mainstream,
pointing to a German author who says it is time to look away from
Nazi atrocities. Such ``intellectual nationalism'' gives comfort to
neo-Nazis, Bubis told an audience of about 2,000 gathered in a
Berlin synagogue.
	   The commemoration of Kristallnacht, when more than 1,300
synagogues were destroyed, has special significance this year as a
new generation of leaders with no personal recollection of the
Holocaust take office.
	   Led by Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, 54, the government returns
next year to Germany's prewar capital, Berlin, seat of Hitler's
dictatorship and the earlier Prussian military state.
	   Remarks by Bubis and others reflected concerns that the
government's move and the generational change underscore a desire
to return to ``normality'' _ for some a Germany unburdened by guilt
for the Holocaust _ by overlooking the past.
	   Schroeder attended Monday's ceremony, where speakers included
German President Roman Herzog and Israel's chief rabbi, Meir Lau,
who recalled his imprisonment as a child in the Nazi concentration
camp Buchenwald.
	   Punctuating concerns about a resurgence of anti-Semitism, tiny
swastikas were found Monday scratched on a Star of David memorial
in Berlin commemorating the mass deportation of the city's Jews to
concentration camps.

Ciba Specialty Chemicals and Clariant merge
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with company news conference. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Ciba Specialty Chemicals AG and
Clariant announced Monday they will merge to form a chemicals giant
with a yearly turnover of 18 billion Swiss francs (dlrs 13
billion).
	   The merger between the two Swiss based firms, worth 20.1 billion
francs (dlrs 14.5 billion), will produce the world's biggest
company making specialty chemicals and dyes.
	   Some 3,000 jobs of the total 55,000 worldwide will be lost in
the process. It is hoped to save about 600 mill be called Clariant. Its logo will be the
butterfly which was Ciba's trademark.
	   Ciba Specialty Chemicals was a spin-off from Ciba Geigy.
Clariant used to be part of Sandoz until it was separated out in
1995. The two former parent companies merged in 1996 to form the
drug group Novartis.
	   The new company chairman will be Rolf Schweizer, current
Clariant president. Vice chairman and Chief Executive Officer will
be Rolf Meyer, the Ciba Speciality Chemicals chairman.
	   The decision to go ahead with the merger came just six weeks
after the two companies' chairmen held their first talks on the
subject, Schweizer told a news conference.
	   The two companies' product portfolios had become increasingly
complementary and both face ``the same difficulties and
challenges,'' he added.
	   The announcement said Germany's Hoechst would retain its 45
percent stake in Clariant until completion of the merger. This
would then be reduced proportionately.
	   Ciba and Clariant said the merger will probably be completed in
the second half of next year. The merger is subject to approval
from regulatory authorities.
	   Swiss approval is expected in January, said Patrick Ducrey, the
deputy head of Switzerland's competition commission.
	   ``The merger shouldn't really pose any problems,'' he added.

	   TELFORD, England (AP) _ Richie Woodhall is set to defend his WBC
super-middleweight title against Italy's Vincenzo Nardiello by the
end of January.
	   The two were orginally set to fight on Sept. 5, but the bout was
called off when Nardiello pulled out, citing a calf injury.
	   Woodhall went on to retain his title in a close decision against
former British middleweight champion Glenn Catley.
	   The Nardiello fight is expected to take place in Telford,
Woodhall's home town, in early January.

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ Government troops chased the last
large group of rebel fighters into the mountains on Monday after
five days of fighting in the Central Asian nation.
	   The 200 rebels concentrated around the town of Aini, about 160
kilometers (100 miles) north of the capital Dushanbe, tried to flee
in small groups toward the border of Uzbekistan after suffering
heavy losses in weekend firefights with government soldiers.
	   ``Practically all the Aini district is now under control of
government troops,'' said Tajikistan Security Minister Saidamir
Zakhurov.
	   Government officials say the rebels would not escape because the
area is surrounded, the border with Uzbekistan has been closed, and
all roads have been cut off.
	   As fighting in Aini subsided, the International Red Cross in
Tajikistan sent a delegation to northern Tajikistan to survey the
damage and distribute medical supplies.
	   Red Cross officials said 40 homes had been completely destroyed
in fighting over the weekend in the city of Khudzhand, and more
than 2,000 homes needed repairs. They also said over 500 people had
been wounded in Khudzhand.
	   The government has said that more than 200 people have been
killed since the fighting broke out last Wednesday.
	   Meanwhile, the whereabouts of rebel leader, former army Col.
Makhmud Khudoberdyev, were unknown, said presidential spokesman
Zafar Saidov.
	   There were unconfirmed reports suggesting that Khudoberdyev and
former Prime Minister Abdumalik Abdulladzhanov had already escaped
into Uzbekistan, Saidov said.
	   The Tajikistan government appealed to Uzbekistan, Russia and
other countries of the former Soviet Union for assistance in
detaining organizers of the revolt.
	   Khudoberdyev launched the uprising with demands that President
Emomali Rakhmonov free all political prisoners and bring his
supporters into the government. The president refused to negotiate
with the rebels.
	   The fighting follows a peace treaty last year that ended five
years of civil war between the Muslim opposition and Rakhmonov's
hardline government. Main opposition groups are now participating
in the government and the armed forces.
	   Still, there are many rebel leaders and warlords who ignore the
accords and wage small-scale attacks across the poor, mountainous
former Soviet republic.
	   Rakhmonov released a statement denouncing the rebels, and saying
their uprising had not derailed Tajikistan's attempts to adhere to
the peace treaty, the ITAR-Tass news agency said Monday.
	   ``The peace process in the republic is continuing and there are
no forces able to stop it,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Winnie Madikizela-Mandela and
two former security force generals implicated by a panel probing
apartheid-era human rights abuses are under criminal investigation,
a prosecutor said Monday.
	   Statements by the prosecutor, Jan d'Oliveira, were the clearest
signal yet that criminal cases would be brought against figures
implicated by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in gross
human rights violations.
	   The commission released its five-volume report, the result of
more than 2 1-2 years of hearings, on Oct. 30. It chronicles the
human rights abuses committed by apartheid governments and their
operatives as well as by the African National Congress and others
fighting the racist system.
	   The commission has the ability to grant amnesty to those who
admit their misdeeds and are found to have acted with political
motives. The report said individuals who have not sought amnesty
should be prosecuted.
	   Such prosecutions could last up to six years, said d'Oliveira,
who recently was appointed a deputy national director of
prosecutions. He said ANC figures were among targets of the
investigations.
	   The issue of continuing prosecutions is significant. Many feel
that dragging on criminal reckonings of the horrors of the
apartheid era will only prolong bitterness and delay
reconciliation. But supporters of prosecution feel that denying
justice to the victims is a worse evil.
	   On a practical level, highly public prosecutions of ANC figures
could have an impact on national elections next year, when the
party will seek to consolidate its hold on power.
	   Madikizela-Mandela has not sought amnesty. The commission found
her accountable for human rights violations committed by her
bodyguards, who the report said killed and tortured suspected
opponents.
	   Madikizela-Mandela was convicted in 1991 of kidnapping and being
an accessory to an assault on four young men. She was sentenced to
six years in jail, but paid a dlrs 3,200 fine on appeal.
	   The case and testimony about her activities before the Truth
Commission was marked by retractions and conflicting words by
witnesses.
	   ``We have good reasons to prepare a prosecution (of
Madikizela-Mandela) except for those imponderables, at the
moment,'' the prosecutor told reporters in Pretoria. He said the
probe was half completed, and did not specify what the accusations
were.
	   Madikizela-Mandela, President Nelson Mandela's former wife, is
an ANC official and among the most prominent anti-apartheid
activists.
	   In other cases, including one of the two unnamed generals
implicated during Truth Commission testimony, prosecutors were
ready to move forward pending decisions on amnesty applications.
The commissioners hope to wrap up their amnesty work by mid-1999.

France's Jospin calls for debt relief for hurricane-hit countries
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin on
Monday called for a moratorium on debt payments owed by countries
hit by hurricane Mitch.
	   ``France wants to lighten the debt of the countries hit by
hurricane Mitch,'' Jospin said in a speech opening a trade and
development conference. ``Paris intends to ask for an acceleration
in debt-load lightening procedures and a debt moratorium on those
countries devastated by hurricane Mitch.''
	   In addition, French President Jacques Chirac said he would add
three countries hardest hit by the hurricane to his visit to
Central America, a presidential spokeswoman said Monday.
	   Chirac, who is scheduled to leave for Mexico and Guatemala
Wednesday, will meet with leaders from Honduras, Nicaragua and El
Salvador next Monday and will ``evaluate with them urgent needs and
more long-term aid Paris could bring to these countries,'' Chirac
spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said.
	   France has already said it would send 250 rescue workers, along
with construction materials to the area. In addition, the country
has committed two military planes and seven helicopters, set to
arrive in the region in coming days.

Pinochet to fight extradition 'with all my spirit'

	   LONDON (AP) _ Lawyers for Gen. Augusto Pinochet told Britain's
highest court Monday that to uphold the former dictator's arrest
would imperil Chile's fragile democracy.
	   A key issue ``is whether the court should interfere with the
delicate balance between the interests of justice and state
stability,'' Clare Montgomery, a lawyer for Pinochet, said in
Parliament's House of Lords.
	   In a weekend statement from the London hospital where he remains
under arrest, Pinochet vowed that he will strenuously fight
prosecutors' efforts to extradite him to Spain on mass murder
charges.
	   Ms. Montgomery opened Pinochet's case on the third day of a
hearing before a five-judge panel in the House of Lords, Britain's
highest court.
	   The hearing was called after prosecutors appealed a Oct. 28 High
Court ruling holding that the Pinochet has diplomatic immunity as a
former foreign head of state.
	   Prosecutors are arguing that the charges of genocide, murder and
toture against the former dictator should overrule any immunity.
	   Ms. Montgomery said Pinochet had been a regular visitor to
Britain since he left office in 1990. But when he arrived for the
latest visit in September, he was also coming at the invitation of
the Royal Ordnance and Arms Supplier, the equivalent of a
government agency, she said.
	   The hearing may last until Tuesday. It is not clear when the
judges will hand down their decision.
	   In his first public statement since his arrest in London last
month, Pinochet said he will fight the extradition ``with all my
spirit.''
	   ``A show trial in a foreign land is not justice,'' he said in a
four-page statement published in newspapers Sunday. ``My fellow
citizens have come to terms with our nation's past. They are my
true judges.''

Thai film board rejects script of `Anna and the King'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By THAKSINA KHAIKAEW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai film authorities on Monday all but
killed the chance of remaking ``Anna and the King of Siam'' on
location, saying script revisions by 20th Century Fox don't go far
enough in changing historical inaccuracies deemed insulting to the
Thai monarchy.
	   Thailand's Film Board stood by a three-week-old judgment that
the movie, starring Oscar winner Jodie Foster and Hong Kong star
Chow Yun Fat, would offend Thai sensibilities.
	   The board also listened to Fox defend itself against charges by
environmentalists that shooting for ``Titanic'' star Leonardo
DiCaprio's latest film, ``The Beach,'' would harm Phi Island in
southern Thailand, where set preparation is under way.
	   ``Anna and the King'' is a remake of the 1946 film ``Anna and
the King of Siam,'' starring Rex Harrison and Irene Dunne. It later
became a Broadway musical and 1956 film, ``The King and I,'' which
made Yul Brynner a major star.
	   The works were based on the memoirs of Anna Leonowens, an
Englishwoman invited in the mid-19th century to the court of Siam,
as Thailand was then known, to teach English to the children of
King Mongkut.
	   Thais consider Hollywood's portrayals of Mongkut _ a noted
Buddhist scholar and linguist who helped bring his country into the
modern era _ as an insulting caricature painting him as a brutal
buffoon.
	   The monarchy is semi-revered in Thailand, and insulting the king
_ something almost no Thai would ever do _ is punishable by three
to 15 years in prison.
	   Though the 1946 film was screened in Thailand, the musical
version remains banned to this day _ even though present King
Bhumibol Adulyadej, the world's longest-reigning monarch, has said
he finds it entertaining.
	   On Monday, the board concluded that changes made to the script
by Hollywood veteran Laurence Blender, aided by a Thai historian,
still approach the subject of Mongkut from the perspective of
Leonowens' disputed memoirs and Margaret Landon's book based on
them, ``Anna and the King of Siam,'' published in 1943.
	   ``It still has the potential to insult the monarchy,'' said
Prasit Damrongchai, the board's president. ``We cannot accept the
script as presented today. There are some inaccuracies that need to
be changed.''
	   Supinda Chacraband, an adviser to Fox, said the company can't
wait much longer and would make a decision by Friday whether to
drop Thailand and shoot the location scenes instead in neighboring
Malaysia.
	   The board said that Fox could submit a revised script again, but
Supinda thought it would be nearly impossible to reach a
compromise.
	   ``Frankly speaking, the chances of getting an approval from the
Thai government film board are very bleak,'' Supinda said.
	   Supinda noted that the only chance Thailand has of influencing
the script _ and how much of the world will probably view Mongkut _
will be lost if the film makers go to Malaysia.
	   Fox, meanwhile, rejected charges by environmentalists and some
residents on Phi Island that filming of DiCaprio's newest film
would destroy the environment.
	   The film makers plan to replant some 100 coconut trees and
temporarily remove some vegetation to broaden one of the beaches
for a soccer-playing scene. They denied allegations that they would
plant marijuana to recreate scenes from the best-selling novel.
	   Phi Island is officially designated a national park, but rich
and powerful Thais have steadily encroached on the island with
tourism facilities for the past 15 years.
	   Emotions raised by the island controversy are considerably lower
than those over ``Anna and the King,'' and there seems less chance
Fox would be turned away.
	   Officials hope ``The Beach'' will serve as good publicity for
the tourism industry.

Duke of Kent says Queen Elizabeth II would like to see Israel

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Queen Elizabeth II would ``love to come'' to
Israel but has not made travel plans, the Duke of Kent said Monday
as he kicked off an official three-day visit to Israel, the first
by a member of the British royal family.
	   The duke met with Israeli President Ezer Weizman and was to hold
talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. However, no meeting
was scheduled with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   The Israeli daily Haaretz said Netanyahu's office was ``amazed''
the duke did not request a meeting with the prime minister.
	   However, British Ambassador Frances Cornish told The Associated
Press that the duke had not intended to snub Netanyahu.
	   ``The visit is a trade visit,'' the ambassador said. ``He has
paid a long courtesy call to President Weizman and will pay a
courtesy call to Chairman Arafat,''
	   The duke, who is a cousin of the queen, is the first member of
the British royal family to visit the region since the end of the
British Mandate and the founding of Israel in 1948.
	   Asked whether a visit by the queen would be next, the duke said:
``I'm sure her majesty would love to come if the opportunity
arose.''
	   The duke said his trip to Israel ``means a lot to me because I
think the achievements of this country have been so remarkable in
these 50 years.''
	   ``Also, this is a particularly interesting time, clearly.''
	   At least three members of the British royal family have made
private visits to Israel.
	   Prince Charles attended Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's funeral
in November 1995. Also in 1995, Princess Margaret visited Israel's
northern Galilee region. In 1994, the queen's husband, the Duke of
Edinborough, attended tree-planting ceremonies honoring his mother,
Princess Alice of Greece, at Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust
memorial.
	   The Duke of Kent is visiting as vice chairman of the British
Overseas Trade Board. On Monday, he met with Trade Minister Natan
Sharansky and Finance Minister Yaakov Neeman. On Tuesday, he was to
hold talks with Arafat and tour companies that do business with
Britain in the West Bank city of Ramallah.
	   Earlier Monday, the duke toured Yad Vashem and paused at
Princess Alice's tree along the Avenue of the Righteous Among the
Nations, which honors people who helped save Jews during the
Holocaust. Princess Alice hid a Jewish woman and four children in
an Athens apartment building during World War II, preventing them
from being sent to German concentration camps.
	   Following his tour, the duke wrote in the Yad Vashem guest book:
``I have been honored and deeply moved to view this memorial to the
victims of persecution.''

<TEXT>
	   SAO TOME, Sao Tome and Principe (AP) _ A center-left party shook
off criticism of its economic record and posted a thumping victory
in general elections in Sao Tome and Principe, according to
projected results Monday.
	   Exit polls showed that the MLSTP/PSD party secured 30 seats in
the 55-seat parliament in Sunday's ballot, state radio reported.
The party ruled the twin-island nation in West African for 16 years
under a single-party Marxist system before the 1991 introduction of
democracy.
	   The country's other major party, the Independent Democratic
Alliance, which is close to President Miguel Trovoada, gained 15
seats. The smaller Democratic Convergence Party, or PCD, snared 10,
according to the projection.
	   Final results were not expected until Tuesday. The impoverished
country has some 49,600 registered voters in a population of
120,000.
	   The MLSTP/PSD was defeated in the country's first democratic
ballot in 1991 but regained power in 1994 elections.
	   Since 1996, when the government was dissolved after an aborted
military coup, it has governed as the major partner in a coalition
with the PCD.
	   Analysts had expected Trovoada's IDA to win Sunday's vote
because of the outgoing administration's failure to reverse the
twin-island nation's economic slide.
	   The unemployment rate hovers round 45 percent and the average
salary is about dlrs 220 per year, while a pair of shoes costs dlrs
50.
	   However, earlier this year the government entered a joint
venture with U.S. company Environmental Remediation Holding Corp.
to develop the country's oil and gas reserves.
	   Oil exports could provide a major boost to the country's economy
and help pay off a foreign debt estimated at dlrs 300 million.
	   Sao Tome and Principe lies in the Gulf of Guinea _ about 240
kilometers (150 miles) west of Gabon _ in one of the most active
oil exploration areas in the African continent.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A group of immigrant job seekers became
robbery victims Monday at the hands of truckers who agreed to give
them a ride, police said.
	   The 23 Iraqi Kurds were on their way from a camp in a northern
Athens suburb to look for work at a cement factory in Mandra, about
30 kilometers (18 miles) west of Athens.
	   Police said the driver stopped the truck along the way then
joined two accomplices to rob the immigrants at gunpoint of a total
of 180,000 drachmas (dlrs 640) and dlrs 300.
	   Tens of thousands of Kurds try to reach Greece each year from
Turkey and the Middle East seeking political asylum or clandestine
transport to other points in Europe. Kurds live in a region that
includes Syria, Turkey, Iraq and Iran.

Myanmar government claims more resignations from opposition party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ A group of members of the opposition
National League for Democracy in western Myanmar voluntarily
resigned from the party and closed their office, a state-controlled
newspaper reported Monday.
	   Eight members of the Sittway township NLD executive committee
tendered their resignations ``out of their own volition'' and
informed the election commission that they ``no longer wish to
continue to take part in the NLD party activities,'' the New Light
of Myanmar newspaper reported.
	   The committee members also disbanded the township office and
handed over the party sign board, party seals and documents to the
township election commission on Oct. 27, the newspaper said.
	   For almost a year, the NLD has accused the government of trying
to force the resignations of its members through threats of arrest
and intimidation.
	   The junta seized power in 1988 after violently quashing
pro-democracy demonstrations. The NLD won a landslide victory in
1990 parliamentary elections, but the military refused to yield
power.
	   This year, the government detained almost 1,000 NLD members in
an effort to block the party's activities. It started releasing
them last month.
	   Official newspapers reported last Friday that the NLD office in
Thanbyuzayat, 180 kilometers (110 miles) southeast of Yangon, was
closed down and its members resigned ``of their own will.''
	   State-run newspapers earlier reported the mass resignation of
NLD members in Myitkyina in the north of Myanmar, also known as
Burma.
	   NLD leaders could not be contacted for comment on the recent
resignation reports.

French nuclear reprocessing plant emits aerial radiation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The environmental watchdog group Greenpeace said
Monday that the French nuclear reprocessing plant at La Hague was
emitting very high levels of aerial radioactivity.
	   Greenpeace said samples of the air taken at an altitude of
between 60 and 120 meters (yards) and up to one kilometer (about
half-a-mile) showed high levels of the radioactive Kr-85 gas.
	   The worldwide average level of radioactivity in the air is
between 1 and 2 becquerels per cubic meter, while the amount
recorded at La Hague was about 90,000 becquerels per cubic meter. A
becquerel is a unit for measuring radioactive decay.
	   Greenpeace, in a communique, expressed concern that this
radioactive air would move around the planet causing contamination
over a wider range of the earth.
	   The group used kites to send up its equipment and took the first
sample on Nov. 4.
	   Spent fuel from the French nuclear power plants, as well as
Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland and Japan are
reprocessed at La Hague plant, which is operated by COGEMA, the
state nuclear fuel reprocessing company.

 &UR; EDs: CORRECTS figure in lede to eight, UPDATES with Cabinet
allocating money for the flooded region in 8th graf. &QL; 
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Heavy floods in western Ukraine have killed
eight people, left much of the region badly damaged, and prompted
the country to appeal for international assistance, officials said
Monday.
	   Emergency workers found all the dead bodies in the Zakarpattia
region, which was inundated by last week's heavy rainfalls, the
Emergency Situations Ministry said.
	   Floods and landslides have destroyed about 800 buildings, dozens
of bridges and dams, cut off electricity to more than 100
settlements, and damaged hundreds of kilometers (miles) of roads
and railways, making some remote villages unreachable, the ministry
said.
	   The government has sent appeals to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan and European Commission President Jacques Santer to deliver
humanitarian aid for people who suffered from the floods.
	   Ukrainian embassies in Western nations also have been instructed
to ask these countries for assistance.
	   The floods have covered 118 towns and villages in the region,
injuring about 300 people. More than 24,000 people were temporarily
evacuated, the ministry said.
	   Emergency Situations Minister Valery Kalchenko has sent more
than 8,400 workers to battle the high waters in the Zakarpattia
region.
	   The Cabinet on Monday allocated 10 million hryvna (2.9 million)
dollars for the relief effort, following orders from President
Leonid Kuchma, who visited the region Friday. No official estimates
of the losses incurred by the floods have been provided so far.
	   The Ukrainian Meteorological Center said Monday that heavy rains
in Zakarpattia would continue until Wednesday, but they no longer
threaten to inundate more settlements.
	   The floods have also hit a dozen settlements in the western Lviv
region, but improving weather there allowed officials to fully
resume electricity to most of the flooded villages.

	   The Sutton St. Nicholas under-12 side, formed a year ago, failed
to find the net once last season and became the laughing stock of
the Herefordshire Junior League.
	   The goal famine continued this season while the team's opponents
averaged a goal every five minutes against Sutton.
	   But the breakthrough came when midfielder Daniel Durkin, who had
quit in desperation as the team's goalkeeper, scored on a
close-range shot to end almost 33 hours of goal-less agony.
	   ``All the parents were jumping up and down cheering _ it was as
if we'd won the FA Cup final,'' said the club's founder,
38-year-old accounts manager Stephen Hunt.
	   Daniel had only agreed to continue playing for the team in a
different position after his mother offered to pay him 2 pounds
(dlrs 3.20) per match.
	   After his goal, Daniel was immediately nicknamed ``Ronaldo'' by
his teammates. And the club said it intends to present him with a
``golden goal'' shield.
	   As for the result of the game, that didn't matter to Daniel and
Sutton's fans. For the record, Sutton lost 12-1 to Bromyard Town.

Tribunal reopens trial of Bosnian Croat accused of allowing rape
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JENIFER CHAO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A U.N. tribunal Monday reopened
the trial of a Bosnian Croat paramilitary commander charged with
war crimes for his alleged failure to prevent the rape of a Muslim
woman.
	   Judges at the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal restarted the trial
of Anto Furundzija after it was disclosed that prosecutors did not
provide some information on the mental condition of their star
witness _ the alleged rape victim.
	   Furundzija, 29, has pleaded innocent to two war crimes charges
for failing to intervene when a subordinate allegedly raped the
woman in May 1993. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of
life imprisonment.
	   His trial is the first war crimes case to deal specifically with
sexual assault committed during an interrogation.
	   The initial trial began in early June and took only five days.
But before judges could hand down a verdict, Furundzija's defense
claimed that prosecutors had intentionally withheld documents that
cast doubts on the memory of the alleged rape victim, who testified
in closed sessions during the trial as ``Witness A.''
	   During this new phase of the trial, which is expected to last a
week, the defense is re-questioning original witnesses including
the victim, who testified in closed session Monday.
	   Ahead of her testimony, a doctor told the U.N. court that the
victim needed psychiatric treatment after the rape and was
suicidal.
	   ``She had become deformed,'' said Dr. Mohammed Mujezinovic,
describing her as a ``beautiful middle-aged woman'' before the
attack. ``It was a shock when I saw her. She appeared frightened
and exhausted.''
	   Prosecutors say Furundzija was the commander of a unit known as
``The Jokers'' which joined Bosnian Croat forces that attacked
Muslim villages in the central Lasva River Valley in 1993.
	   The rape victim was taken to the Jokers' headquarters and
interrogated by Furundzija and another soldier. She was later raped
by this unidentified member of The Jokers in the presence of
Furundzija, who ``did nothing to stop or curtail that action,'' the
tribunal contends.
	   The U.N. court, which has indicted 58 people, was established in
1993 to try individuals charged with war crimes allegedly committed
in the former Yugoslavia since 1991. Twenty-six suspects are in
custody.

U.S. provides Laos dlrs 55,000 aid for medical facility
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The United States has donated dlrs
55,000 worth of medical supplies and financial assistance to help
Laos prepare against possible outbreaks of disease.
	   The money and supplies will go toward developing a laboratory
with diagnostic capabilities in Champassak province in southern
Laos, said a statement received Monday from the U.S. Embassy in the
Laotian capital, Vientiane.
	   The donation includes laboratory equipment, field specimen
collecting equipment and computer and communication equipment, it
said.
	   The contribution is part of a program, worth dlrs 180,000, to
help Laos develop an infectious disease outbreak response.
	   It was launched by the U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit 2 and
the Lao Health Ministry in April 1997, the statement said.
	   A training workshop was organized in Vientiane in February and
plans are under way for a second one to be held in Champassak next
February.

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ The Prince of Wales finished a
four-nation, weeklong tour of Eastern Europe Monday with a visit to
the tiny stock market and small businesses of this former communist
nation.
	   Early Monday, Prince Charles rang a bell to start the trading
day at the two-year-old Macedonia Stock Exchange which has eight
licensed brokerages and two listed companies.
	   He then chatted with directors of small companies, partially
financed by British government loans, who showed him Macedonia-made
wares, including bathroom tissue, basketball hoops and
chemical-free cabbages.
	   The prince's visit Monday was meant to help raise the profile of
Macedonia's fledling small-business sector which the British
government has helped fund since this nation of two million split
peacefully from Yugoslavia in 1992. Most of the country's business
and industrial sectors are still in state hands.
	   The son of Queen Elizabeth II also visited the Macedonian
Institute of Earthquake Engineering and Seismology, which was
formed with Japanese help after a 1963 earthquake killed 1,071
Skopje residents and damaged 70% of the city's buildings.
	   The prince didn't speak to reporters during the tour.
	   ``The tour cemented relations with the British and the countries
visited,'' said Sandra Henney, the prince's press secretary. ``The
prince was particularly interested in architecture and organic
farming.''
	   The prince also visited centuries-old churches, monasteries and
other buildings in the four nations he visited - Macedonia,
Bulgaria, Slovenia and Romania.

Yemen executes convicted murderer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ A man convicted of murder was publicly
executed Monday by a firing squad in southern Yemen, officials
said.
	   The victim's family and hundreds of onlookers witnessed the
execution of Jaabal al-Burkani in a public square in Abyan
province, about 280 kilometers (175 miles) south of the capital,
San`a.
	   Al-Burkani was convicted of murdering Ahmed Abdullah Juailan
after an argument last year, the officials said, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   Yemen, an impoverished country at the southern tip of the
Arabian Peninsula, imposes the death penalty for rape and murder.
Most executions are carried out in public by a firing squad to set
an example.

Car thief calls auto club for help starting stolen car
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ When a car thief couldn't get his stolen
vehicle to start, he called the Falkan auto club to come help him.
He ended up catching a lift to jail.
	   The auto club's mechanics at first thought the driver, who had
keys to the car, was just another stranded motorist, Falkan
employee Jan-Kaare Helgeland told the Stavanger Aftenbladet
newspaper about Saturday's incident.
	   ``Our people got suspicious ... because the vehicle did not have
any license plates. The supposed owner seemed a little tipsy, and
could not explain why his license plates were missing,'' Helgeland
was quoted as saying in the newspaper's Monday edition.
	   The mechanics quietly called the police, and then proceeded to
work on the car. The car, an Opel Astra, had been stolen from an
auto paint shop in Stavanger, on Norway's southwestern coast.
	   It just wasn't the thief's day. Even though he had keys with a
built-in remote control, the car wouldn't start because of a defect
in its antitheft mechanism. The thief, whose name was not reported,
was arrested by police and jailed.

Islamic experts press for understanding on human rights issues

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Islamic scholars defended their religion's
human-rights record Monday before a special U.N. forum aimed at
improving respect for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
	   ``It is not strange for the Arabs and Muslims to support the
International Declaration of Human Rights because they can find in
it a collection of supreme humanitarian principles which are
compatible with their faith and traditions,'' said Kamel Al-Sharif
who leads an Islamic relief organization in Jordan.
	   Critics of the religion have been organizing anti-Islamic
campaigns which portrayed a false image of the religion, said
al-Sharif of the International Islamic Council for Daw'a (Religious
Calling) and Relief.
	   Al-Sharif was one of 20 authorities on Islamic law invited to
speak at the two-day event, which Mary Robinson, U.N. high
commissioner for human rights, organized at Iran's suggestion.
	   In her keynote speech, Mrs. Robinson said Islam, the religion of
one-fifth of world's population, has ``the dignity of the human
person, tolerance and equity at the core of its message.''
	   Apart from Mrs. Robinson, all the speakers were Muslims.
Human-rights organizations complained that they were barred from
asking questions or commenting at the seminar.
	   Ahmad Kamal Abdoumagd, professor of public law at the University
of Cairo, told the seminar that no country has entirely lived up to
what was stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, now
in its 50th anniversary year.
	   ``This is nothing particular to Islam. It is everywhere,'' said
Abdoumagd.
	   ``Else how can we understand that in a highly developed country
like the United States racial discrimination and other forms of
discrimination continue to survive?''
	   Human rights organizations have accused Iran and other Muslim
countries of systematic abuse that includes extrajudicial killings,
torture and harsh prison conditions.
	   Abdoumagd also attacked Muslims and non-Muslims who rejected the
Islamic Shariah legal code as the only way to ensure human rights,
saying the suggestion lacked ``cultural legitimacy.''
	   ``No Muslim would accept a solution that doesn't stem internally
from his culture,' he said.
	   The event has been put together in conjunction with the
Organization of the Islamic Conference, which has 52 member
countries.
	   ``We are hoping it will be the start of a process,'' John Pace,
spokesman for the U.N. commission, said before the start of the
conference. ``The purpose is to remove or help to remove certain
levels of ignorance of values and customs.''

England captain to miss World Cup qualifier
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England rugby union captain Lawrence Dallaglio on
Monday pulled out of Saturday's World Cup qualifier against the
Netherlands with a knee injury.
	   Dallaglio twisted his right knee during Wasps' defeat at
Northampton on Saturday, limping off four minutes from time.
	   Dallaglio will be replaced as captain for Saturday's game at
Huddersfield by 1997 British Lions captain Martin Johnson.
	   England team officials said they believe Dallaglio should be fit
when England faes Italy on Nov. 22 in another World Cup qualifier
in Huddersfield.
	   England coach Clive Woodward reduced last week's squad from 37
to 32, with Leicester's Martin Corry coming into the back row as
reinforcement for the absent Dallaglio. Corry won two caps in
Argentina last year.
	   Woodward will cut his squad to 26 on Thursday for the two
qualifiers, and will also name the team to face the Dutch.
	   Even without Dallaglio, England is expected to roll to a big
victory against the Dutch, who are barely in the third rank of
international opposition.

Copenhagen sells Goldbaek to Chelsea

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ FC Copenhagen on Monday sold
midfielder Bjarne Goldbaek to Chelsea Football Club, only three
days after purchasing Denmark's top player Brian Laudrup from the
English Premier League team.
	   Goldbaek earlier played for German clubs Schalke 04, FC
Kaiserslautern and FC Cologne. He returned to Denmark in 1996. He
also has played 12 games for the Danish national side.
	   In a statement, the Danish club said Goldbaek immediately would
join the London team. It didn't disclose the tranfer sum.
	   FC Copenhagen said Friday it had signed a 2 1/2-year contract
with striker Laudrup in a transfer reported at 1 million pounds
(dlrs 1.6 million). The announcement came a day after Chelsea
eliminated the Danish side from the Cup Winners Cup.

EU warns U.S. against imposing sanctions over banana imports
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with approval of transatlantic trade plan. Quotes from
French foreign minister, ADDS byline
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The threat of a trade battle between
the European Union and United States over bananas overshadowed the
approval Monday by EU foreign ministers of a transatlantic plan
designed to prevent trade disputes.
	   The 15-nation EU told the United States to back off from threats
of trade sanctions to counter the EU's banana import regime,
warning such action could be deeply harmful to relations.
	   ``The transatlantic partnership depends on the United States
renouncing unilateral sanctions,'' said French Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine at a meeting of EU foreign ministers.
	   ``We can only deplore that the United States is turning its back
on dialogue.''
	   Over the weekend, the United States warned of punitive action if
the 15-nation EU does not change its banana trade system, which
Washington claims unfairly favors imports from former European
colonies.
	   ``If the U.S. goes down the unilateral road, we believe it would
have extremely damaging consequences,'' EU trade spokesman Nigel
Gardner said in response.
	   However, the EU ministers approved a plan to start negotiations
with Washington on new agreements to removing barriers for trade in
goods and services, public procurement and intellectual property.
	   France expressed relief the scope of the negotiations had been
scaled down from the original proposal to create a transatlantic
free-trade zone. The plan is expected to go forward to the next
EU-U.S. summit, slated for Nov. 30.
	   The U.S. administration has outlined possible retaliation if the
EU defies a rulings by the World Trade Organization on the
international banana trade.
	   London's Financial Times newspaper said Monday Washington would
issue a preliminary list of EU products this week on which the
United States will impose sanctions to retaliate against the banana
import regime.
	   If Washington goes ahead with the move, EU countries are
expected to respond in kind, raising the specter of a transatlantic
trade war, EU officials said.
	   The United States is unhappy with the EU's efforts so far to
respond to last year's negative WTO ruling on the banana regime,
which grants favorable treatment to a number of African, Caribbean,
and Pacific region countries.
	   The WTO suit championed banana growers in Latin America who felt
discriminated by the new regime.
	   The EU approved new import regulations in an attempt to remedy
the situation and bring it into line with WTO regulations. But the
United States and Latin Americans claim it is still discriminatory.
	   ``We estimate we have complied with the WTO,'' said Vedrine,
indicating no new EU concessions were upcoming.

Juventus midfielder Di Livio questioned in anti-doping
</HEADLINE>
investigation &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ Juventus of Turin veteran midfielder Angelo
Di Livio was questioned Monday in Italy's continuing anti-doping
probes, news reports said.
	   After a two-hour meeting with Turin Prosecutor Raffaele
Guariniello, Di Livio, who also plays on Italy's national team,
went past reporters without any comments.
	   He was the latest in a long series of soccer players, doctors
and managers to be questioned by Guariniello, who is conducting one
of the several anti-doping investigations currently underway in
Italy.
	   The inquiries were sparked by AS Roma coach Zdenek Zeman's
remarks last summer that he was amazed by the quick muscular growth
of some Serie A top players.
	   A doping scandal has shaken the world of soccer since then.
	   Fallout has included the resignation of Italian Olympic
Committee (CONI) president Mario Pescante and the firing of the
chief of CONI's drug-testing laboratory.

President ask ministers to study fact-finders' report on May riots
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ President B.J. Habibie ordered six of
his Cabinet members Monday to thoroughly study the findings of a
team that investigated Indonesia's deadly May riots.
	   After three months of investigation, the 18-member panel set up
by the president released its findings last Tuesday, saying some
members of the military provoked crowds to loot and burn during the
riots in the capital, Jakarta, and other cities.
	   It said others simply let mobs go wild during the May 13-15
riots, which led President Suharto to quit after 32 years of
authoritarian rule.
	   Habibie, who replaced Suharto, has asked six Cabinet ministers
to study the findings and report to him, State Secretary Akbar
Tanjung said Monday after a meeting with the president.
	   The six are Home Affairs Minister Syarwan Hamid, Foreign
Minister Ali Alatas, Justice Minister Muladi, Defense and Security
Minister Gen. Wiranto, State Minister for Women's Affairs Tuty
Alawiyah and Attorney General Andi Muhammad Ghalib.
	   Wiranto, who is also chief of the armed forces, had said earlier
it was not proper for the team to make its analyses public.
	   The unrest, sparked by economic hardship and the killings of
four student protesters by the military on May 12, left 1,200
people dead.
	   The team's report came as a further blow to the armed forces,
now caught between widespread allegations of human rights abuses
under Suharto and a new role as a promoter of democratic reform
promised by Habibie.
	   The panel, which included human rights activists, senior police
officers, lawyers, bureaucrats and community leaders, recommended
that the military expedite the process of trying military officers
involved in the abduction of pro-democracy activists, in which 12
were still missing.
	   The suspects include Suharto's son-in-law, Prabowo Subianto, a
former three-star army general and chief of elite forces called
Kopassus.
	   The panel's report also disputes military claims that no mass
sexual attacks were committed during the riots, concluding instead
that 66 women were raped and another 10 were assaulted.

British Petrolum to create 3,100 new jobs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British Petroleum said Monday it will add 3,100
jobs at two new chemical plants to be built in Britain.
	   The new plants, in Grangemouth, Scotland, and
Kingston-Upon-Hull, on England's northeast coast, are part of a 500
million pound (dlrs 830 million) investment in BP's chemical
business in the United Kingdom.
	   As many as 2,200 jobs will be created at Grangemouth, in central
Scotland, and 900 in Hull. The jobs will be created over the next
four years, with the plants due to be completed in 2002, the
company said.
	   ``This is an important step in the development of our European
chemicals business,'' BP Chief Executive John Brown said. ``The
northeast U.K. is an excellent location for manufacturing
petrochemicals.''
	   The projects will add to 1 billion pounds (dlrs 1.66 billion) of
investments already made by BP in its oil, gas and petrochemical
site at Grangemouth. The project also will include the extension of
BP's pipe network.
	   BP said it plans to link the sites to its North Sea gas
supplies, which are expected to increase output beginning in 2000.

	   BERLIN (AP) _ Warnings against a resurgent anti-Semitism colored
ceremonies Monday marking the 60th anniversary of Kristallnacht _
or ``Night of Broken Glass'' _ when the Holocaust began with Nazi
storm troopers burning and ransacking Jewish businesses and
synagogues.
	   Ignatz Bubis, the leader of Germany's Jews, noted with alarm
that ideas once considered extremist have become mainstream,
pointing to a German author who says the media uses Nazi atrocities
to make Germans feel guilty about their past. Such ``intellectual
nationalism'' gives comfort to right-wing extremists, Bubis told an
audience of about 2,000 gathered in a Berlin synagogue.

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ The Taliban religious army wants
evidence of Islamic militant Osama bin Laden's involvement in
terrorist activity by Nov. 20 or ``in our eyes he will be
acquitted,'' Abdul Hai Muttmayan said Monday.
	   Bin Laden has been indicted by a U.S. court in the Aug. 7
bombing of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224
people. Washington has offered dlrs 5 million for his arrest.
	   The Taliban say they won't turn bin Laden over to the United
States, but if the U.S. administration has evidence of his
involvement in terrorist activity he will be tried under the
religious militia's laws.
	   About two weeks ago the Taliban set up a judicial inquiry,
headed by Chief Justice Noor Mohammed Saqib, to investigate
allegations against bin Laden.
	   In the 90 percent of Afghanistan controlled by the Taliban, a
harsh form of Islamic law is enforced which imposes the death
penalty for terrorism.
	   So far the judicial inquiry doesn't have any evidence to back
Washington's claims that bin Laden heads a terrorist network of
Muslim militants devoted to attacking U.S. interests worldwide.
	   ``If anyone has any evidence of bin Laden's involvement in cases
of terrorism, subversion, sabotage or any other acts they should
present it to the court before Nov. 20,'' said Muttmayan, a Taliban
spokesman. ``If by then there is nothing, we will close the case
and in our eyes he will be acquitted.''
	   The Taliban army says bin Laden is their honored guest and in
Afghan society that guarantees him protection from his enemies, and
right now his biggest enemy appears to be the United States.
	   Washington fired Tomahawk cruise missiles at Afghanistan on Aug.
20, striking suspected terrorist camps believed to be operated by
bin Laden, the man whose loathing for the United States is linked
to the presence of U.S. troops in his native Saudi Arabia.
	   The Taliban say the United States is ``hostile'' to bin Laden,
whom they say has promised not to use Afghanistan as a staging
arena for terrorist attacks elsewhere.
	   But U.S. intelligence officials paint a picture of bin Laden's
network that links his militant fighters with attacks on U.S.
troops and citizens in Somalia, Saudi Arabia and East Africa.

Tribunal reopens trial of Bosnian Croat accused of allowing rape
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JENIFER CHAO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A U.N. tribunal on Monday reopened
the trial of a Bosnian Croat paramilitary commander charged with
war crimes for his alleged failure to prevent the rape of a Muslim
woman.
	   Judges at the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal restarted the trial
of Anto Furundzija after it was disclosed that prosecutors did not
provide information on the mental condition of their star witness _
the alleged rape victim.
	   Furundzija, 29, has pleaded innocent to two war crimes charges
for failing to intervene when a subordinate allegedly raped the
woman in May 1993. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of
life imprisonment.
	   His trial is the first war crimes case to deal specifically with
sexual assault during an interrogation.
	   The initial trial began in early June and took only five days.
But before judges could hand down a verdict, Furundzija's defense
claimed that prosecutors had intentionally withheld documents that
raised doubts about the memory of the alleged rape victim, who
testified in closed sessions during the trial as ``Witness A.''
	   During this new phase of the trial, which is expected to last
one week, the defense is re-questioning original witnesses
including the victim, who testified Monday in closed session.
	   Before her testimony, a doctor told the U.N. court that the
victim needed psychiatric treatment after the rape and was
suicidal.
	   ``She had become deformed,'' said Dr. Mohammed Mujezinovic,
describing her as a ``beautiful middle-aged woman'' before the
attack. ``It was a shock when I saw her. She appeared frightened
and exhausted.''
	   Prosecutors say Furundzija was the commander of a unit known as
``The Jokers,'' which joined Bosnian Croat forces that attacked
Muslim villages in the central Lasva River Valley in 1993.
	   The rape victim was taken to the Jokers' headquarters and
interrogated by Furundzija and another soldier. She was later raped
by this unidentified member of The Jokers in the presence of
Furundzija, who ``did nothing to stop or curtail that action,'' the
tribunal contends.
	   The U.N. court, which has indicted 58 people, was established in
1993 to try individuals charged with war crimes allegedly committed
in the former Yugoslavia since 1991. Twenty-six suspects are in
custody.

EU unemployment below 10 percent for first time in 6 years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Unemployment in the European Union fell
to 9.9 percent in September, the first time in 6 years that the
jobless rate has fallen below 10 percent, the EU's statistics
office said Monday.
	   In the previous three months, Eurostat reported unemployment
holding steady at 10 percent across the 15-nation bloc. In
September 1997, the rate stood at 10.6 percent.
	   Eurostat said unemployment had been falling steadily since the
beginning of 1997, but its monthly report still showed 16.6 million
citizens out of work.
	   The EU rate compares with 4.6 percent in the United States and
4.2 percent in Japan.
	   Eurostat showed varying degrees of success in reducing
unemployment over the past six years. From December 1992, Danish
unemployment fell by more than half from 10 percent to 4.3 percent.
Ireland's rate dropped from 15.6 percent to 8.8 percent and
Britain's from 10.8 percent to 6.3 percent.
	   Over the same period, the jobless rate rose in Germany from 7.1
percent to 9.5 percent and in Italy from 9.2 percent to 12.3
percent.
	   Eurostat gave the following seasonally-adjusted jobless rates
for September 1998 with September 1997 rates in brackets:
	   Denmark, 4.3 percent (5.2); Austria, 4.5 (4.4); Portugal, 4.6
(6.7); Sweden, 7.7 (9.6); Belgium, 8.8 (9.2); Ireland, 8.8 (9.9);
Germany, 9.5 (10.2); Finland, 11.2 (12.4); France, 11.9 (12.4);
Spain, 18.7 (20.5).
	   September 1998 figures were unavailable for Luxembourg,
Netherlands, Britain, Italy and Greece.
	   Latest figures from Eurostat showed Luxembourg with 2.2 percent
and Netherlands with 3.7 percent in August, Britain with 6.3 and
Italy with 12.3 percent percent in July.
	   Eurostat gave no data for Greece.

Convention tries to mend rift in Bulgaria's Orthodox Church
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Single name correct for patriarchs. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Officials of Bulgaria's Orthodox Church
gathered Monday in a last-ditch effort to overcome the year-long
rift that has plagued the church.
	   The Convention of Clergy and Laity was called by clergymen of
lower ranks. Angered by the disastrous split they have repeatedly
urged their feuding leaders to quit and help thus solve the
conflict that has disappointed many of the faithful in this
post-communist country.
	   Since 1991, Bulgaria's main church has been split between
supporters of Patriarch Maxim, who served as church leader under
communist rule, and Pymen, whose followers seceded in 1991 and
proclaimed him patriarch in 1996. Maxim then promptly declared him
expelled from the church.
	   Now a new statute of the church is scheduled to be approved at
the convention that will regulate the election of a patriarch. As
of now a new patriarch can be elected only if his predecessor dies.
	   But Patriarch Maxim and his supporters boycotted the convention,
and although there was no immediate comment from him it is hardly
expected that he will comply with its decisions.
	   The convention follows a meeting of spiritual leaders of the
Orthodox world who gathered last month in Sofia trying to bring
together the two wings, but the result was just a fragile
compromise.
	   The clergymen led by Pymen, who had seceded from the canonic
Synod of Patriarch Maxim, declared then that they are penitent,
expecting in return Maxim to step down.
	   But the embattled leader of Bulgaria's Orthodox church regarded
the decisions of the Pan-Orthodox convention as personal support
and rejected calls for his resignation by local clergymen.
	   The seven year-old power struggle has seriously damaged the
image of the Orthodox church and prevented it from being a moral
compass for the post-Communist age.
	   A number of small, non-traditional denominations such as the
Jehovah's Witnesses and followers of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's
Unification Church have sprung up to fill the vacuum.
	   Many Orthodox churches all over Eastern Europe perceive
Protestant missionary work as a threat to their flocks.
	   The vast majority of Bulgaria's 8.5 million people come from an
Orthodox background, even if they don't practice religion.

EU debates rearranging Central America debt to help crisis-hit

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union foreign ministers on
Monday considered granting debt relief to Central American nations
hit by Hurricane Mitch as part of an aid package to help them
overcome the devastation.
	   Several EU foreign ministers said the EU should release further
emergency aid for Honduras, Guatemala, Salvador and Nicaragua,
where torrential rains and mudslides killed an estimated 10,000
people and left tens of thousands of others without food and
shelter.
	   The EU already approved a total 6.8 million European currency
units (dlrs 8.2 million) in humanitarian aid for the four
countries, but over the past few days the extent of the devastation
has proved to be greater than it first appeared.
	   German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer told reporters urgent
measures are needed to provide victims with basic aid, including
medicine, water sanitation and shelter.
	   The ministers were debating the possibility of unblocking
emergency funds for Central America. The funds would be taken from
the EU's budget for its common foreign and security policy.
	   In the longer term, the ministers have asked the EU executive
Commission to come up with a series of proposals to help the
Central American countries with their reconstruction efforts. These
measures could include a scrapping or rearranging of the region's
debts.
	   ``It's an interesting proposal but it's not the only one,''
Spain's State Secretary Ramon De Miguel told reporters.
	   De Miguel said the ministers have asked the EU executive
Commission to come forward with a series of proposals by November
30, when development ministers are scheduled to meet in Brussels.
	   Hunger and disease threaten to raise Mitch's death toll from
Mitch.
	   Relief agencies are trying to feed tens of thousands isolated by
Hurricane Mitch, trying to deliver tons of food, despite ruptured
roads, backed-up airports and too few helicopters.
	   Both De Miguel and Fischer stressed that the EU and the United
States should coordinate their aid efforts for Central America.

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The Arab Potash Co. said Monday its profits
between January and June this year declined by 22 percent because
of reduced international demand and competition with other firms
worldwide.
	   APC's account sheet said profits this year amounted to 6.26
million Jordanian dinars (dlrs 8.8 million), compared with 7.99
million dinars (dlrs 11.2 million) during same period in 1997.
	   It said sales in the same period this year decreased by 12
percent to 579,000 tons.
	   ``The reduced sales are a result of diminishing world demand on
the product as well as tough competition with potash producers
worldwide,'' said APC's chairman Saleh Irsheidat.
	   The firm _ a joint venture between the governments of Jordan,
Kuwait, Libya and Iraq _ extracts potash from the Dead Sea, the
lowest point on earth.
	   Its exports make up 13 percent of Jordan's total exports.
 &UR; ___
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's 2 million nomads own about 25 million
heads of livestock and produce 2 trillion rials (dlrs 666 million)
worth of goods each year, the head of Iran's tribal affairs
organization said Monday.
	   Jehanshah Seddiq said that nomadic tribes help the economy by
creating 700,000 job opportunities through their livestock, the
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   It quoted him as saying that, with good planning, 7 million
heads of livestock raised by nomads could be exported.
	   Seddiq said that since 1995, 12,000 nomadic households had been
voluntarily resettled. But he said there was no future plan for
compulsory settlement of nomads.
	   The Iranian government embarked on a plan of compulsory
settlement for nomads after the 1979 Islamic Revolution, but the
plan ran out of steam when powerful nomadic tribes insisted on
maintaining their wandering lifestyles.

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Islamic scholars defended their religion's
human-rights record Monday before a special U.N. forum aimed at
improving respect for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
	   ``It is not strange for the Arabs and Muslims to support the
International Declaration of Human Rights because they can find in
it a collection of supreme humanitarian principles which are
compatible with their faith and traditions,'' said Kamel Al-Sharif
who leads an Islamic relief organization in Jordan.
	   Critics of the religion have been organizing anti-Islamic
campaigns which portrayed a false image of the religion, said
al-Sharif of the International Islamic Council for Daw'a (Religious
Calling) and Relief.
	   Al-Sharif was one of 20 authorities on Islamic law invited to
speak at the two-day event, which Mary Robinson, U.N. high
commissioner for human rights, organized at Iran's suggestion.
	   In her keynote speech, Mrs. Robinson said Islam, the religion of
one-fifth of world's population, has ``the dignity of the human
person, tolerance and equity at the core of its message.''
	   Apart from Mrs. Robinson, all the speakers were Muslims.
Human-rights organizations complained that they were barred from
asking questions or commenting at the seminar.
	   Ahmad Kamal Abdoumagd, professor of public law at the University
of Cairo, told the seminar that no country has entirely lived up to
what was stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, now
in its 50th anniversary year.
	   ``This is nothing particular to Islam. It is everywhere,'' said
Abdoumagd.
	   ``Else how can we understand that in a highly developed country
like the United States racial discrimination and other forms of
discrimination continue to survive?''
	   Human rights organizations have accused Iran and other Muslim
countries of systematic abuse that includes extrajudicial killings,
torture and harsh prison conditions.
	   Abdoumagd also attacked Muslims and non-Muslims who rejected the
Islamic Shariah legal code as the only way to ensure human rights,
saying the suggestion lacked ``cultural legitimacy.''
	   ``No Muslim would accept a solution that doesn't stem internally
from his culture,'' he said.
	   The event has been put together in conjunction with the
Organization of the Islamic Conference, which has 52 member
countries.
	   ``We are hoping it will be the start of a process,'' John Pace,
spokesman for the U.N. commissioner, said before the start of the
conference. ``The purpose is to remove or help to remove certain
levels of ignorance of values and customs.''

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ When a car thief couldn't get his stolen
vehicle to start, he called the Falken auto club to come help him.
He ended up catching a lift to jail.
	   The auto club's mechanics at first thought the driver, who had
keys to the car, was just another stranded motorist, Falken
employee Jan-Kaare Helgeland told the Stavanger Aftenbladet
newspaper about Saturday's incident.
	   ``Our people got suspicious ... because the vehicle did not have
any license plates. The supposed owner seemed a little tipsy, and
could not explain why his license plates were missing,'' Helgeland
was quoted as saying in the newspaper's Monday edition.
	   The mechanics quietly called the police, and then proceeded to
work on the car. The car, an Opel Astra, had been stolen from an
auto paint shop in Stavanger, on Norway's southwestern coast.
	   It just wasn't the thief's day. Even though he had keys with a
built-in remote control, the car wouldn't start because of a defect
in its antitheft mechanism. The thief, whose name was not reported,
was arrested by police and jailed.

the process. It is hoped to save about 600 million francs (dlrs 444
million) per year through rationalization, a statement said.
	   The merger will take the form of a share swap. Ciba shareholders
will receive 46 percent of the shares and Clariant shareholders 54
percent.
	   The new company will be called Clariant. Its logo will be the
butterfly which was Ciba's trademark.
	   Ciba Specialty Chemicals was a spin-off from Ciba Geigy.
Clariant used to be part of Sandoz until it was separated out in
1995. The two former parent companies merged in 1996 to form the
drug group Novartis.
	   The new company chairman will be Rolf Schweizer, current
Clariant president. Vice chairman and Chief Executive Officer will
be Rolf Meyer, the Ciba Speciality Chemicals chairman.
	   The decision to go ahead with the merger came just six weeks
after the two companies' chairmen held their first talks on the
subject, Schweizer told a news conference.
	   The two companies' product portfolios had become increasingly
complementary and both face ``the same difficulties and
challenges,'' he added.
	   The announcement said Germany's Hoechst would retain its 45
percent stake in Clariant until completion of the merger. This
would then be reduced proportionately.
	   Ciba and Clariant said the merger will probably be completed in
the second half of next year. The merger is subject to approval
from regulatory authorities.
	   Swiss approval is expected in January, said Patrick Ducrey, the
deputy head of Switzerland's competition commission.
	   ``The merger shouldn't really pose any problems,'' he added.

Premier says that flow of immigrants to Italy is no emergency
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Premier Massimo D'Alema on Monday played down fears
that Italy would be overwhelmed by the steady arrival of illegal
immigrants.
	   ``We are not facing any dramatic emergency,'' D'Alema told
journalists during a weekly briefing. ``Among European countries,
we are the least hard hit by the flow of immigrants.''
	   Waves of would-be immigrants have been arriving on Italy's long
coastline for much of this decade. Many pay smugglers to take them
across the Adriatic on rickety boats or motorized dinghies from
Albania or northern Africa.
	   There are an estimated 200,000-250,000 illegal immigrants in
Italy.
	   Under a limited amnesty, Italy last week began offering work
permits to those who can prove they have a job and have been here
since March, when Italy tightened its immigration laws.
	   Since the measure went into effect, tens of thousands of
immigrants have been lining up outside police stations to apply for
38,000 permits. After the huge turnout, Italy's interior ministry
indicated that a higher number of permits might be granted.
	   D'Alema said it was better to encourage immigrants to apply for
legal status than to let them fall into the hands of criminals who
often hire them for drug trafficking, prostitution and other
illegal activities.
	   Legalizing the immigrants who have legitimate work also means
more taxes in the country's coffers.
	   D'Alema plans to meet with Albanian Prime Minister Pandeli Majko
Tuesday to discuss a number of issues, including how to block the
flow of immigrants arriving from Albania. One proposal would allow
Italian police vessels to patrol the Albanian coast.

Big bad wolf fights with three little pigs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISTOL, England (AP) _ That was more than just huffing and
puffing when the wolf went after the three little pigs in a
half-time show at an English first division soccer match.
	   A full-scale fight broke out between team mascots at Bristol
City's Ashtown Gate stadium during the home club's 6-1 defeat
Saturday to Wolverhampton Wanderers.
	   A crowd of 15,000 watched as Wolfie, the Wolverhampton mascot,
brawled with City Cat, the Bristol mascot, and three pig mascots
representing a local double glazing company.
	   Stewards waded in to pull the mascots apart. Trouble flared
again in the tunnel to the locker rooms where one of the pigs,
30-year-old Patrick Kelly, suffered a split lip.
	   The five mascots were ejected from the stadium, and City Cat was
fired on the spot.
	   ``We all thought it was play-acting and the Wolves fans were
cheering, bit then it all went a bit wrong when one of the pigs
whacked Wolfie,'' 30-year-old Bristol City fan David Singleton
said.
	   ``There was another scuffle by the tunnel and I saw Wolfie catch
a pig with a left hook, and the City Cat steamed in. Then the
stewards marched them out.''
	   Ross Smith, director of the double glazing firm which sponsors
the pig mascots, said Wolfie was a ``big, burly bloke'' who was
taking his role too seriously.
	   ``Because the costume is a big bad wolf he thinks he has to be
big and bad too,'' Smith said. ``He was goading the pigs at
half-time and one went over and said, `Calm down, mate, we are
supposed to be entertaining thousands of people.''

French actor Jean Marais dead at 84
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARILYN AUGUST &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Jean Marais, the French actor who began his career
in art films as the protege of surrealist artist Jean Cocteau and
became a pillar of the French cinema, has died at 84, city
officials said Monday.
	   Marais had been in declining health for the past year and was
hospitalized in June with malnutrition. He died Sunday at the
Broussailles hospital in Cannes, southern France.
	   A would-be actor twice rejected from France's top drama schools,
Marais went on to become one of the nation's most beloved movie
stars _ thanks to Cocteau.
	   The two met in 1937. At the time, Marais was struggling to eke
out a living, while Cocteau was a dominant force on the French
cultural scene.
	   Marais' good looks and strong personality appealed to Cocteau
who would later tell him, ``There's a catastrophe. I've fallen in
love with you.''
	   The two became inseparable, and were one of France's most
prominent couples in the arts until Cocteau's death in 1963. The
relationship fired Cocteau's imagination, inspiring many plays,
films, poems and drawings.
	   Strikingly handsome, with thick blond hair which turned to pure
white as he aged, Marais was best known for his role as the hairy
beast in Rene Clement's 1945 classic,``The Beauty and the Beast.''
	   His early roles included ``Les Parents Terribles,'' first on the
stage later and on screen, ``Orphee'' in 1949, and ``Le Testament
d'Orphee'' in 1960.

Islamic Pakistan's Murree Beer to enter British market
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AMIR ZIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Armed with catchy slogans like,
``Eat, drink and be Murree,'' and ``Eat curry with Murree'' Islamic
Pakistan's oldest and only brewery begins flogging its brew in
Britain this month.
	   After two decades of prohibition, business at home in Pakistan
is barely a dribble for the 137-year-old Murree Brewery Co. Ltd.,
says owner M.P. Bhandara.
	   But he's hoping for a frothing business in Britain.
	   ``Murree Beer is a well-known beer,'' Bhandara said. ``Before
prohibition in 1979, it was exported to many markets, including the
United States.''
	   While Bhandara cannot export his beer from Pakistan, an Austrian
brewery has been given a license to brew Murree Beer in Austria for
export to Britain and other European countries.
	   Inspired by the success of subcontinental food in Britain,
Bhandara said the first outlets for Murree Beer will be in the
restaurants that serve cuisine common to the region, like spicy
curries, lentils and meat kabobs.
	   ``Subcontinental food has become the third favorite food in the
United Kingdom after hamburgers and pizzas,'' he said. ``Curry is
very popular in the UK, that is why one of our slogans will be `Eat
curry with Murree.'''
	   Indian beers _ Kingfisher and Cobra _ are likely to be Murree
Beer's main competitors.
	   While only the beer produced in Austria will be destined for
foreign markets, there is concern about a backlash at home in
Pakistan, where Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is seeking to pass a
law introducing a new Islamic order. Under strict Islamic law,
alcohol is forbidden.
	   In Pakistan, non-Muslims, who comprise barely 3 percent of its
140 million people, are allowed to drink alcohol. For Muslims, it
is an offense punishable by jail.
	   Bhandara's well-guarded brewery in Rawalpindi, some 20 (12.5
miles) kilometers from the capital, Islamabad, produces beer and
liquor only for the non-Muslims _ officially. But there is a big
black market in Pakistan, where anyone can buy Murree Beer.
	   Producing beer in Pakistan can be troublesome.
	   ``There have been pressures on us from time to time ... and we
are certainly very apprehensive,'' said Bhandara. ``I hope this
government is not carried away by populist slogans.''

	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ The Prince of Wales finished a weeklong
Eastern European tour of Monday with a visit to Macedonia's tiny
stock market and small businesses.
	   Early Monday, Prince Charles rang a bell to start the trading
day at the two-year-old stock exchange in the former communist
nation. The tiny exchange has eight licensed brokerages and two
listed companies.
	   He then chatted with directors of small companies partially
financed by British government loans, who showed him Macedonian
wares, including bathroom tissue, basketball hoops and
chemical-free cabbages.
	   The prince's visit Monday was meant to help raise the profile of
Macedonia's fledling small-business sector, which the Britishtute of Earthquake Engineering and Seismology, formed with
Japanese help after a 1963 earthquake killed 1,071 Skopje residents
and damaged 70 percent of the city's buildings.
	   The prince didn't speak to reporters during the tour.
	   ``The tour cemented relations with the British and the countries
visited,'' said Sandra Henney, the prince's press secretary. ``The
prince was particularly interested in architecture and organic
farming.''
	   The prince also visited centuries-old churches, monasteries and
other buildings in the four nations he visited _ Macedonia,
Bulgaria, Slovenia and Romania.

Thousands of Bucharest students on strike over underfunding
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Thousands of students in Bucharest cut
classes on Monday to protest poor school conditions and the
proposed opening of a Hungarian-German language university.
	   Students railed against outdated equipment, poor-quality
accommodation and too few grants. They want a law that says
education must receive 4 percent of the Gross Domestic Product.
	   ``In the past eight years, the students' status has dropped in
Romanian society,'' said Razvan Ilie, spokesman for the Students'
League. On Sunday, students dismissed the head of the Students'
League, accusing him of failing to promote students' rights.
	   The protest comes in the wake of similar protests in six other
Romanian cities which started last week. Teachers also protested
low salaries last month.
	   Students are also asking for more grants and free public
transportation.
	   In addition, they want the government to annul a decision which
gave the go-ahead for a Hungarian-German language multicultural
university.
	   Ilie said it offended Romanians because there is no Romanian
language program foreseen in the Hungarian-German university. The
government decided to set up such a university to mend a rift with
ethnic. Hungarians in the government.
	   Education Ministry State Secretary Mihai Korka said most of the
students' claims can be solved within their universities.
	   In October, more than 200,000 teachers and professors refused to
enter classrooms to protest low salaries and budget cuts for
education. The government later agreed to give teachers more money.

Incumbent mayor scores razor-thin victory in Bucharest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with final results, comment from mayor, turnout. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Mayor Viorel Lis has won a narrow
victory to keep his post as head of Romania's capital city for the
next two years, final results showed Monday.
	   Lis received 50.5 percent of the vote, according to the Central
Election Bureau. Sorin Oprescu, director of the city's Municipal
Hospital, trailed with 49.5 percent.
	   Lis said the mandate would give him new authority to resolve
Bucharest's problems. He said it was inevitable to see an erosion
of support for his party, the Democratic Convention, because it had
been in office for two years.
	   Turnout was low for the third straight Sunday, with only 37.8
percent of the 1.7 million eligible voters casting ballots.
	   Lis, 55, was the previous mayor's deputy and has been running
this city of 3 million since December 1996. He represents the
Democratic Convention, the main political force of the ruling
coalition which has run Bucharest since 1992.
	   Oprescu was supported by the leftist Party of Social Democracy
and nationalist parties. Some 22 candidates ran for elections. The
race was whittled down to Lis and Oprescu, who finished well ahead
of the other candidates, but failed to get over 50 percent for an
outright victory in the first two rounds.
	   Bucharest is overcrowded and plagued by problems with
substandard housing and a poor water supply, deteriorated roads and
pollution. Since 1989 when communism ended, problems have gotten
worse as the city's population has increased.
	   The election was necessary after previous mayor Victor Ciorbea
quit the post to become prime minister in 1996. He resigned from
that job in April, quitting as mayor at the same time.

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Islamic scholars Monday defended their religion's
human-rights record before a special United Nations forum aimed at
improving respect for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
	   ``There are still some circles in the West, acting out of their
own vested interests, who still persist on perpetuating fears and
arousing suspicion about Islam,'' said Kamel Al-Sharif of Jordan,
secretary-general of an Islamic relief organization.
	   Critics of the religion have been organizing anti-Islamic
campaigns which portrayed a false image of the religion, said
al-Sharif, of the International Islamic Council for Daw's
(religious calling) and Relief. .
	   ``It is not strange for the Arabs and Muslims to support the
International Declaration of Human Rights because they can find in
it a collection of supreme humanitarian principles which are
compatible with their faith and traditions,'' he said.
	   Al-Sharif was one of 20 authorities on Islamic law invited to
speak at the two-day event, organized by Mary Robinson, U.N. high
commissioner for human rights, at the suggestion of Iran.
	   In her keynote speech, Mrs. Robinson said Islam, which is the
religion of a fifth of the people on the planet, had ``the dignity
of the human person, tolerance and equity at the core of its
message.''
	   Apart from Mrs. Robinson, all the speakers were Muslims.
Human-rights organizations have complained that they are barred
from asking questions or commenting at the seminar.
	   Ahmad Kamal Abdoumagd, professor of public law at the University
of Cairo, told the seminar that no country entirely lived up to
what was stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, now
in its 50th anniversary year.
	   ``This is nothing particular to Islam. It is everywhere,'' said
Abdoumagd.
	   ``Else how can we understand that in a highly developed country
like the United States racial discrimination and other forms of
discrimination continue to survive?''
	   Abdoumagd also attacked Muslims and non-Muslims who called for
the rejection of the Islamic Shariah legal code as the only way to
ensure human rights, saying the suggestion lacked ``cultural
legitimacy.''
	   ``No Muslim would accept a solution that doesn't stem internally
from his culture,' he said.
	   The idea for the seminar was born when Mrs. Robinson visited
Iran in February. The Iranians suggested a scholarly event to try
to bring together Islamic culture and the rights declaration.
	   Human rights organizations have accused Iran and some other
countries in the Muslim world of systematic abuses that include
extrajudicial killings, torture and harsh prison conditions.
	   The event has been put together in conjunction with the
Organization of the Islamic Conference, which has 52 member
countries.
	   ``We are hoping it will be the start of a process,'' John Pace,
spokesman for the U.N. commissioner, said before the start of the
seminar.
	   ``The purpose is to remove or help to remove certain levels of
ignorance of values and customs.''

Premier says that flow of immigrants to Italy is no emergency
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Premier Massimo D'Alema on Monday played down fears
that Italy would be overwhelmed by the steady arrival of illegal
immigrants.
	   ``We are not facing any dramatic emergency,'' D'Alema told
journalists during a weekly briefing. ``Among European countries,
we are the least hard hit by the flow of immigrants.''
	   Waves of would-be immigrants have been arriving on Italy's long
coastline for much of this decade. Many pay smugglers to take them
across the Adriatic on rickety boats or motorized dinghies from
Albania or northern Africa.
	   There are an estimated 200,000-250,000 illegal immigrants in
Italy.
	   Under a limited amnesty, Italy last week began offering work
permits to those who can prove they have a job and have been here
since March, when Italy tightened its immigration laws.
	   Since the measure went into effect, tens of thousands of
immigrants have been lining up outside police stations to apply for
38,000 permits. After the huge turnout, Italy's interior ministry
indicated that a higher number of permits might be granted.
	   D'Alema said it was better to encourage immigrants to apply for
legal status than to let them fall into the hands of criminals who
often hire them for drug trafficking, prostitution and other
illegal activities.
	   Legalizing the immigrants who have legitimate work also means
more taxes in the country's coffers.
	   D'Alema plans to meet with Albanian Prime Minister Pandeli Majko
Tuesday to discuss a number of issues, including how to block the
flow of immigrants arriving from Albania. One proposal would allow
Italian police vessels to patrol the Albanian coast.

French actor Jean Marais dead at 84
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with background, details.
 &UR; By MARILYN AUGUST &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Jean Marais, the French actor who began his career
in art films as the protege of surrealist artist Jean Cocteau and
became a pillar of the French cinema, has died at 84, city
officials said Monday.
	   Marais had been in declining health for the past year and was
hospitalized in June with malnutrition. He died Sunday at the
Broussailles hospital in Cannes, southern France, city officials
there said.
	   A would-be actor twice rejected from France's top drama schools,
Marais went on to become one of the nation's most beloved movie
stars _ thanks to Cocteau.
	   The two met in 1937. At the time, Marais was struggling to eke
out a living, while Cocteau was a dominant force on the French
cultural scene.
	   Marais' good looks and strong personality appealed to Cocteau,
who would later tell him, ``There's a catastrophe. I've fallen in
love with you.''
	   The two became inseparable, and were one of France's most
prominent couples in the arts until Cocteau's death in 1963. The
relationship fired Cocteau's imagination, inspiring many plays,
films, poems and drawings.
	   Strikingly handsome, with thick blond hair which turned to pure
white as he aged, Marais was best known for his role as the hairy
beast in Rene Clement's 1945 classic,``The Beauty and the Beast.''
	   His early roles included ``Les Parents Terribles,'' first on the
stage later and on screen, ``Orphee'' in 1949, and ``Le Testament
d'Orphee'' in 1960.
	   He also starred in ``The Hunchback'' and was a swashbuckling
hero in films such as ``Le Capitan,'' ``Le Capitain Fracasse'' and
the ``Fantomas'' series with Louis de Funes.
	   Marais worked with top directors such as Jean Renoir, Luchino
Visconti and Abel Gance.
	   In the mid-1990s, he starred at the famed Paris cabaret Les
Folies Bergeres, and played Prospero in Shakespeare's ``the
Tempest.''
	   He published several books about his life, and had a show of his
art work in 1995.
	   ``Life is unfair,'' he told the Journal du Dimanche newspaper in
1996. ``I got nothing but the best.''
	   Marais was born on Dec. 11, 1913 in Cherbourg. Soon after, his
mother left his father and settled in a Parisian suburb with Jean
and his brother, Henri.
	   Jean was fascinated by the theater at a young age, and would
tell his friends his mother was an actress at the Comedie
Francaise.
	   He wasn't much of a student, going from school to school and
finally dropping out at the age of 16.
	   Several attempts to get into acting school failed, and he earned
a living as an apprentice photographer before meeting Cocteau.
	   Marais had one adopted son, Serge.

Incumbent mayor scores razor-thin victory in Bucharest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with final results, comment from mayor, turnout. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Mayor Viorel Lis has won a narrow
victory to keep his post as head of Romania's capital city for the
next two years, final results showed Monday.
	   Lis received 50.5 percent of the vote, according to the Central
Election Bureau. Sorin Oprescu, director of the city's Municipal
Hospital, trailed with 49.5 percent.
	   Lis said the mandate would give him new authority to resolve
Bucharest's problems. He said it was inevitable to see an erosion
of support for his party, the Democratic Convention, because it had
been in office for two years.
	   Turnout was low for the third straight Sunday, with only 37.8
percent of the 1.7 million eligible voters casting ballots.
	   Lis, 55, was the previous mayor's deputy and has been running
this city of 3 million since December 1996. He represents the
Democratic Convention, the main political force of the ruling
coalition which has run Bucharest since 1992.
	   Oprescu was supported by the leftist Party of Social Democracy
and nationalist parties. Some 22 candidates ran for elections. The
race was whittled down to Lis and Oprescu, who finished well ahead
of the other candidates, but failed to get over 50 percent for an
outright victory in the first two rounds.
	   Bucharest is overcrowded and plagued by problems with
substandard housing and a poor water supply, deteriorated roads and
pollution. Since 1989 when communism ended, problems have gotten
worse as the city's population has increased.
	   The election was necessary after previous mayor Victor Ciorbea
quit the post to become prime minister in 1996. He resigned from
that job in April, quitting as mayor at the same time.

France's Jospin calls for debt relief for hurricane-hit countries
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with 3 grafs of comments from French finance minister
and background in grafs 9,10 and 11 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin on
Monday called for a moratorium on debt payments owed by countries
hit by hurricane Mitch.
	   ``France wants to lighten the debt of the countries hit by
hurricane Mitch,'' Jospin said in a speech opening a trade and
development conference. ``Paris intends to ask for an acceleration
in debt-load lightening procedures and a debt moratorium on those
countries devastated by hurricane Mitch.''
	   Adding urgency to Jospin's plea, French Finance Minister
Dominique Strauss-Kahn Monday called on the Paris Club of creditor
nations to suspend debt service payments for the next two to three
years for the countries hit hardest by the hurricane.
	   In a statement, Strauss-Kahn also called on the Paris Club and
on other multilateral institutions _ the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund _ ``to accelerate their treatment of
these countries' debt.''
	   In particular, Strauss-Kahn called on the Paris Club to grant
debt relief terms under the highly indebted poor countries program
for Nicaragua, which would allow debt reduction of up to 80
percent. He also called for application of the so-called ``Naples
terms'' for Honduras, which would allow debt relief of up to 67
percent.
	   Also Monday, French President Jacques Chirac said he would add
three countries hardest hit by the hurricane to his visit to
Central America, a presidential spokeswoman said Monday.
	   Chirac, who is scheduled to leave for Mexico and Guatemala
Wednesday, will meet with leaders from Honduras, Nicaragua and El
Salvador next Monday and will ``evaluate with them urgent needs and
more long-term aid Paris could bring to these countries,'' Chirac
spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said.
	   France has already said it would send 250 rescue workers, along
with construction materials to the area. In addition, the country
has committed two military planes and seven helicopters, set to
arrive in the region in coming days.
	   Throughout Central America, the storm killed an estimated 11,000
people and left millions left homeless.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton last week requested a ``global
relief effort'' and issued orders boosting U.S. emergency aid to
dlrs 70 million.
	   Inter-American Development Bank officials said last week that
the hardest-hit nation, Honduras, will need six years to recover
from the hurricane, which destroyed its entire banana crop and
damaged as much as 90 percent of the nation's roads and other
infrastructure.

<TEXT>
	   SHARJAH, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Marvan Atapattu led a
remarkable fielding display Monday to help Sri Lanka dismiss India
for 179, and give the world champions a strong chance of winning
their first game in the three-nation Coca Cola Trophy.
	   After losing their first two matches, the Sri Lankans, pepped by
a day's rest, fired India by sending half their team back to the
pavilion for just 88 runs in the 30 over.
	   Atapattu was the star of the field, running out Sauruv Ganguly
in the second over with a direct throw at the stumps, with India's
score at 1.
	   He then took successive catches to send back Nayan Mongia (3)
and a big wicket of ace batsman Sachin Tendulkar (18), off paceman
Pramodaya Wickremasinghe, playing his first match in the
competition.
	   Atapattu, who ran several meters (yards) to take Tendulkar's
catch, was not finished yet. He later snapped up seasoned Captain
Mohammed Azharuddin (26 off 46 balls) off spinner Thilan
Samaraweera in the 30th over and ended the innings by running out
Anil Kumble (12), the last man.
	   Another brilliant fielding came from Roshan Mahanama, who leaped
in the air with his arms spread out to take a catch at mid-off,
which saw batsman Nikhil Chopra off the field and give Kumara
Dharmasena one of his three wickets.
	   Ajay Jadeja, one of the three run out victims, anchored the
Indian innings with a fine 64, including a six and a boundary, off
174 balls.
	   Dharmasena, who failed to click in the previous matches, was the
pick of the bowlers, taking 3 for 31 from nine overs.
	   However, paceman Chaminda Vaas kept a tight leash on the Indian
batsman, conceding 12 runs from six overs and finished 1 from 37
from his spell of 10 overs.
	   Sri Lanka needs an average 3.58 per over to record its first win
in the tournament. Zimbabwe is the third team playing in this dlrs
85,000 tournament, which ends on Nov. 13.

Germany will contribute to security force for Kosovo observers
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Germany will contribute to a military force that
will protect unarmed observers monitoring compliance with a peace
deal in Yugoslavia's Kosovo province, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
said Monday.
	   After his first meeting as chancellor with NATO Secretary
General Javier Solana, Schroeder said there was ``seamless
agreement'' that pressure must be kept on Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic so that he sticks to the Oct. 12 agreement that
averted potential NATO military strikes.
	   The deal calls for up to 2,000 international observers to go to
Kosovo to make sure Milosevic reduces security forces in Kosovo and
stops attacks on civilians.
	   A rapid intervention force _ about 1,800 soldiers with tanks and
helicopters _ is to be stationed in neighboring Macedonia in case
the observers face trouble.
	   France has offered to provide up to half the troops, and
Schroeder said Germany would also contribute, although numbers have
yet to be determined.
	   Schroeder said the two also discussed the Washington summit on
NATO expansion coming up in April and the recent debate on
improving Europe's own military capabilities to reduce reliance on
U.S.-led NATO.
	   Schroeder insisted, however, that any new muscle for the
European Union would not lessen Germany's commitment to NATO
itself.
	   ``Such concerns are utterly unnecessary,'' he said.

Duke of Kent says Queen Elizabeth II would like to see Israel

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Queen Elizabeth II would ``love to come'' to
Israel _ but has not made travel plans, the Duke of Kent said
Monday at the start of his official three-day visit.
	   The duke, who is a cousin of the queen, is the first member of
the British royal family to visit the region since the end of the
British Mandate and the founding of Israel in 1948.
	   Asked whether a visit by the queen would be next, the duke said:
``I'm sure her majesty would love to come if the opportunity
arose.''
	   The duke met with Israeli President Ezer Weizman and was to hold
talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. However, no meeting
was scheduled with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   The Israeli daily Haaretz said Netanyahu's office was ``amazed''
the duke did not request a meeting with the prime minister.
However, British Ambassador Frances Cornish told The Associated
Press that the duke had not intended to snub Netanyahu during what
was described as a trade visit.
	   The duke said his trip to Israel ``means a lot to me because I
think the achievements of this country have been so remarkable in
these 50 years.''
	   ``Also, this is a particularly interesting time, clearly.''
	   At least three members of the British royal family have made
private visits to Israel.
	   In 1995, Prince Charles attended Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's
funeral and Princess Margaret visited Israel's northern Galilee
region. In 1994, the queen's husband, the Duke of Edinburgh,
attended tree-planting ceremonies honoring his mother, Princess
Alice of Greece, at Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust memorial.
	   Earlier Monday, the duke toured Yad Vashem and paused at
Princess Alice's tree along the Avenue of the Righteous Among the
Nations, which honors people who helped save Jews during the
Holocaust. Princess Alice hid a Jewish woman and four children in
an Athens apartment building during World War II, preventing their
deportation to concentration camps.

	   ``We believe that with good will on both sides, that a
compromise could be worked out,'' Former Irish Prime Minister
Albert Reynolds told reporters.
	   He said he met with Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz,
for more than two hours on Sunday. He described Aziz as ``open''
and ``very flexible.''
	   Reynolds, a member of the Irish Parliament, was credited with
encouraging a 1994 cease-fire in Ireland. He planned to leave Iraq
later Monday and said he would travel to the United States on
Thursday to confer with U.S. politicians.
	   He appealed to the United States and Britain to abandon threats
of a military strike and to negotiate a settlement.
	   But Britain's Defense Secretary George Robertson on a visit to
Kuwait said the world's patience with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein
is ``draining away.''
	   A diplomatic solution to resolve the crisis is ``still
possible'' but the ``option of force is there, is real,'' Robertson
told reporters in Kuwait where Britain has stationed 12 Tornado
bombers.
	   Also Monday, five more inspectors from the U.N. Special
Commission _ which is responsible for elimination of Iraq's
chemical and biological weapons as well as long-range missiles _
left the country.
	   Caroline Cross, UNSCOM spokeswoman in Baghdad, said 10 more
inspectors are to depart Wednesday, which will raise the total to
30 since UNSCOM began the partial pull out Saturday.
	   She noted that more than 100 U.N. weapons staffers remain in the
country and could resume inspections immediately if Iraq changes it
positions.
	   Iraq announced on Oct. 31 that it was halting cooperation with
UNSCOM until the Security Council begins moving to lift the
sanctions imposed to punish Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The sanctions, which ban the sale of oil and other financial
dealings, have devastated Iraq's economy.
	   On Sunday, U.S. President Bill Clinton met with top security
advisers, but put off a decision on whether to use force against
Iraq to reopen military sites to U.N. inspectors.
	   Reynolds said: ``Today I would like to send a very clear message
and a clear call to the United Nations, to President Clinton and to
(British) Prime Minister Tony Blair that whatever (their feelings)
about the conflict, that everybody gets around the table to
dialogue and debate and talk to remove the sanctions.''
	   Reynolds suggested that the United Nations lift restrictions on
the import of medicine to allow a free flow of pharmaceutical
supplies into Iraq.
	   U.N. sanctions do not bar the import of medicines to Iraq, but a
U.N. committee carefully screens all imports to Iraq. Baghdad
repeatedly has claimed that the screening has led to serious
delays.

Duke of Kent says Queen Elizabeth II would like to see Israel

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Queen Elizabeth II would ``love to come'' to
Israel but has not made travel plans, the Duke of Kent said Monday
as he kicked off an official three-day visit to Israel, the first
by a member of the British royal family.
	   The duke met with Israeli President Ezer Weizman and was to hold
talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. However, no meeting
was scheduled with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   The Israeli daily Haaretz said Netanyahu's office was ``amazed''
the duke did not request a meeting with the prime minister.
	   However, British Ambassador Frances Cornish told The Associated
Press that the duke had not intended to snub Netanyahu.
	   ``The visit is a trade visit,'' the ambassador said. ``He has
paid a long courtesy call to President Weizman and will pay a
courtesy call to Chairman Arafat,''
	   The duke, who is a cousin of the queen, is the first member of
the British royal family to visit the region since the end of the
British Mandate and the founding of Israel in 1948.
	   Asked whether a visit by the queen would be next, the duke said:
``I'm sure her majesty would love to come if the opportunity
arose.''
	   The duke said his trip to Israel ``means a lot to me because I
think the achievements of this country have been so remarkable in
these 50 years.''
	   ``Also, this is a particularly interesting time, clearly.''
	   At least three members of the British royal family have made
private visits to Israel.
	   Prince Charles attended Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's funeral
in November 1995. Also in 1995, Princess Margaret visited Israel's
northern Galilee region. In 1994, the queen's husband, the Duke of
Edinburgh, attended tree-planting ceremonies honoring his mother,
Princess Alice of Greece, at Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust
memorial.

EU: food aid of dlrs 480 million, humanitarian aid of dlrs 8.4
</HEADLINE>
million for Russia &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union is cobbling together
plans to grant Russia dlrs 480 million in food aid though some EU
nations raised questions Monday about giving food to a country that
still exports wheat.
	   Separately, the EU executive Commission proposed a package of
humanitarian assistance for Russia of dlrs 8.4 million.
	   Officials at a meeting of EU foreign ministers said the European
Commission was studying proposals for cereals, meat and milk powder
to be sold in Russia at market prices with the proceeds going into
a fund to finance social projects.
	   The EU would pay its farmers for the food delivered to Russia.
The value of the aid would be 400 million European currency units
(dlrs 480 million).
	   The EU plan was put forward four days after the United States
announced it would provide Russia with food aid worth dlrs 600
million.
	   ``It is a clear signal of our political and material support for
Russia,'' EU Foreign affairs Commissioner Hans van den Broek told
reporters. He added, ``We need to ensure that this (EU) aid reaches
its destination and that it does not distort traditional trade
flows.''
	   Officials said Russia was expected to formally request the food
aid in a matter of days. EU officials will go to Moscow this week
to examine projects that could receive humanitarian assistance.
	   If the aid is granted, Russia will be held to strict conditions.
It must provide anti-fraud guarantees, it cannot re-export EU food
and must ensure the food reaches the needy.
	   The EU ``looks to the Russian government to take the
administrative measures necessary to facilitate'' distribution of
the aid, the foreign ministers said.
	   The EU foreign ministers did not debate the measure in detail
but the Netherlands and Britain suggested the EU tread carefully.
	   ``There is not a general food shortage in Russia,'' said Dutch
Foreign Minister Jozias van Aartsen.
	   ``We have to be careful. Russia is still selling grain on world
markets.''
	   It was expected the EU package will be finalized in the weeks
ahead to give the EU leaders the opportunity to make a formal
announcement when they meet Dec. 11-12 in Vienna, Austria.
	   The EU stock of surplus grain is currently about 10 million
tons. In addition it has some 500,000 tons of beef and 400,000 tons
of rice in surplus stocks.
	   Russia has been hit hard by economic problems coupled with the
worst grain harvest in 40 years. Food prices have risen 50 percent
due to the financial crisis, prompting worries that the poor won't
be able to afford food.
	   Russian officials have said their emergency reserve will last
only two to three weeks.

Slovenian premier admits legislation reforms proceed slowly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) _ Premier Janez Drnovsek acknowledged
Monday that the country's legislative reforms were too slow, as
assessed last week by the European Union.
	   ``We are very much aware of these problems,'' Drnovsek told a
news conference. ``The reforms indeed are too slow.''
	   Slovenia, a former Yugoslav republic which proclaimed
independence in 1991, is eager to join the European Union and other
western institutions.
	   As one of 10 Eastern European nations that may be included in
the EU's eastward enlargement, Slovenia started preliminary talks
with that pan-European institution in March.
	   But the setback came last week when the European Commission,
although commending Slovenia for its developed market economy,
warned of ``a worrying slowdown'' in writing EU legislation into
its national laws.
	   Drnovsek said that the government has been trying to find a way
to speed up the process.
	   He said that the reform of the tax system, including the
introduction of a value-added tax (VAT), which is one of the EU
requirements, ``is nearly completed.'' The pension system reform
has just started, Drnovsek added.
	   Some analysts and the opposition charge that the government
coalition, composed of Social Liberals led by Drnovsek and the
People's Party led by Marijan Podobnik, has been slow in
introducing reforms due to their attempts to find a balance between
EU requirements and popular support.
	   The Social Democrats, led by former Defense Minister Janez
Jansa, said earlier that the EU criticism should lead to early
elections.

U.S. House committee chairman: Clinton should be 'called to
</HEADLINE>
account' &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with start of hearing. &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURIE KELLMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The Republican House chairman Monday declared
President Bill Clinton should be ``called to account'' for his
conduct as members sought to define what constitutes an impeachable
offense.
	   Rep. Charles Canady, chairman of the House panel on the
Constitution, opened a hearing with a sharply worded attack on
Clinton. He rejected arguments that conduct in a private lawsuit
can't be grounds for impeachment.
	   ``If the president is guilty of the offenses charged against
him, he must be called to account under the Constitution for the
commission of high crimes and misdemeanors,'' Canady declared.
	   ``He must be called to account for putting his selfish personal
interest ahead of his oath of office and his constitutional duty.
He must be called to account for undermining the integrity of the
high office entrusted to him,'' he added.
	   The top Democrat on the Constitution subcommittee of the House
Judiciary committee, Rep. Bobby Scott, welcomed the opportunity to
questions scholars about the matter but noted that a panel of 19
witnesses was evenly divided on whether prosecutor Kenneth Starr's
allegations against Clinton constituted grounds for removing the
president.
	   But Scott said ``the American public should not be fooled by the
illusion'' and that ``the overwhelming majority of scholars have
said the offenses do not constitute grounds for impeachment.''
	   Monday's hearing was a prelude to formal impeachment hearings
set to begin next week in the full Judiciary Committee chaired by
Illinois Republican Henry Hyde. Hyde attended the hearing, but
passed up an initial chance to comment at its opening.
	   Days before the hearing, the scholars clashed on paper over the
standard for impeachment and whether Clinton's efforts to cover up
his affair with Monica Lewinsky make him unfit for office.
	   In prepared remarks, one professor declared that the evidence
set out against Clinton by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr meets
that standard.
	   ``They are not trivial matters having to do with the private
life of a president,'' Northwestern University law professor
Stephen Presser said in prepared remarks. ``They are fundamental
refusals to carry out constitutionally mandated duties and are thus
impeachable offenses.''
	   Democrats have countered that the standard for impeachment
should be whether the president's actions have undermined the
government. Some witnesses for the Democrats already have contended
that the president's behavior falls short of impeachable conduct
because it did not affect his official duties.
	   In addition, law professors Susan Low Bloch and Robert Drinan of
Georgetown and Laurence Tribe of Harvard were among more than 400
academicians who signed a letter to House and committee leaders
opposing Clinton's impeachment. Such action, they said in the
letter, would weaken the presidency by allowing Congress to impeach
anyone holding that office whose behavior they disapprove.

Belgrade court punishes independent daily
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with owner's quotes, other details. Adds byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A court fined the chiefs of an
independent daily the equivalent of dlrs 120,000 for breaching
Serbia's restrictive new information law, media reported Monday.
	   Following a trial held Sunday against formerly banned Dnevni
Telegraf, the Belgrade district court ruled that its publishing
company and chief editor would pay the steep amount for
``publishing information inciting destruction of the constitutional
order.''
	   The verdict and the trial against the newspaper, known for its
criticism of President Slobodan Milosevic's autocratic regime, came
only a day after it resumed publishing following weeks of
government bans, court trials and police raids.
	   In its first edition Saturday, Dnevni Telegraf ran an ad paid by
a Belgrade University student group that called for the abolishment
of the existing government.
	   Four students belonging to the group were arrested last week for
spraying graffiti of the group's symbol, a clenched fist, and
sentenced to ten days' imprisonment each.
	   Within hours of running the ad, a high-ranking Serbian
neo-communist official and a close Milosevic associate sued the
daily, saying it violated Serbia's recently enacted media law.
	   ``This is a staged trial, a farce ... what we are dealing with
is a judicial outrage,'' said Slavko Curuvija, the owner of Dnevni
Telegraf.
	   Curivija told Associated Press Television News that he had ``a
very tough conversation'' with Milosevic's neo-communist wife
Mirjana Markovic days before the crackdown against independent
media started last month.
	   ``I told her everything very openly. ... I told her I thought
her husband was guilty of everything that happened to Serbs in the
past ten years and that he spoiled everything the Serbian state did
in the past 150 years,'' he said.
	   ``I warned her that if they don't do anything to end the
dictatorship, all will deteriorate in bloodshed next year,''
Curuvija added, indicating the crackdown against his newspaper was
Markovic's personal vendetta against him and his newspaper.
	   The defendants and their lawyers stormed out of the court Sunday
after two hours of hearings, claiming the judge was biased.
	   The court gave the publisher 24 hours to pay the fine.
	   Dnevni Telegraf said in its Monday edition that its publisher
does not have the financial means to pay the hefty fine and
predicted Serbian authorities would start confiscating the next
day's edition Monday night.
	   Dnevni Telegraf was first banned last month when Serbia's
government passed a decree demanding strictly ``patriotic''
coverage of events, especially the ongoing crisis in Serbia's
Kosovo province. Two other papers also were banned.
	   The decree was then superseded by a restrictive media law that
levied huge fines on media for articles authorities deemed
anti-state.
	   Again, Dnevni Telegraf's publisher was among the first fined but
refused to pay. Shortly afterward, police raided the newspaper's
Belgrade office, hauling away equipment in partial compensation for
the money owed.
	   The paper found a loophole and resumed publishing in Montenegro,
the other republic which together with Serbia makes up the Yugoslav
federation and where the new media law does not apply.

Soccer greats help kick off new FIFA initiative
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Soccer legends Pele, Bobby Charlton,
Franz Beckenbauer and Michel Platini met Monday with FIFA President
Sepp Blatter for discussions on a new panel to address
``fundamental issues facing the game.''
	   The four will be members of the FIFA Football Committee, which
will be chaired by Spanish soccer federation president Angel Maria
Villar.
	   It should be formally set up in December and will also include
current players, referees, coaches, managers and doctors, the world
governing body said in a statement.
	   The new committee should meet four or five times a year. It will
not discuss the laws of soccer but will concentrate on ``the future
welfare of the game in more general terms,'' Blatter said.
	   The visit followed a personal initiative by the Brazilian Pele,
who had requested a meeting with Blatter to discuss future
cooperation, FIFA said.
	   ``It's vital that the professional sector of football uses its
resources and expertise to help the smaller federations,''
Germany's Beckenbauer said.
	   ``The good image of the game itself is the responsibility of all
of us.''

United, Arsenal still favorites, but Villa finally gets respect
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Premier League leader Aston Villa is finally
comanding some respect from British bookmakers as a legitimate
title contender, but Manchester United and Arsenal are still the
bookies' favorites.
	   Arsenal's 1-0 home win Sunday over Everton resulted in Ladbrokes
cutting the Gunners' Premier League odds from 9-4 to 2-1. The
defending league and FA Cup champions remain second favorite behind
Manchester United, listed at 5-4.
	   Chelsea is third favorite at 5-1.
	   Villa, which started the season at 40-1 and has not been taken
very seriously despite its unbeaten Premiership season so far, saw
its odds shortened into single figures for the first time.
	   Ladbrokes cut Villa's odds from 10-1 to 8-1 after Saturday's 3-2
win over Tottenham. Villa tops the league table with 25 points, two
ahead of Arsenal and three ahead of Manchester United.
	   Liverpool, meanwhile, fell from 7-1 to 12-1 after its 2-1 defeat
to Derby at Anfield.

Lawmakers call for lifting of right-winger's immunity over boycott
</HEADLINE>
call &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ A right-wing lawmaker who urged a
boycott of U.S. and Jewish goods earlier this year lost an initial
round Monday in his attempt to preserve his parliamentary immunity
under Switzerland's anti-racism law.
	   A committee of parliament's lower house voted 14-7 to recommend
the move against Rudolf Keller, leader of the splinter nationalist
Swiss Democrats, because of his reaction to pressure on Swiss banks
leading up to their settlement with Holocaust survivors.
	   Full parliamentary approval would be required before Keller
would be subject to prosecution.
	   Keller released a statement in early July calling on the Swiss
to boycott ``all American and Jewish goods, restaurants and
vacation offers'' until the end of ``these mean and totally
unjustified attacks and complaints against Switzerland, Swiss firms
and banks.''
	   His call was in response to a U.S. plan, supported by major
Jewish organizations, to impose increasing sanctions on Switzerland
until the banks agreed to a settlement of claims by heirs of
Holocaust victims, who said the Swiss banks had failed to return
the assets of their relatives who were killed by the Nazis in World
War II.
	   In August, Switzerland's two biggest banks agreed to pay dlrs
1.25 billion in an out-of-court settlement of the claims.
	   Keller's call was met with a criminal complaint for racism,
which led Zurich state authorities to ask that his immunity be
lifted.
	   ``We have to make it clear that we can't accept this,'' lawmaker
Judith Stamm, a panel member, told reporters.

Four militants killed in gunbattle with security forces in Kashmir

	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ Security forces battled for five hours
with separatist militants holed up in a residential area in the
capital of disputed Kashmir Monday and shot dead four of them,
police said.
	   In a separate incident late Sunday, Indian troops and
separatists fought near the town of Kupwara. Five militants and one
soldier were killed.
	   Police and witnesses said a unit of 10 militants ambushed an
Indian patrol in Srinagar Sunday night with hand grenades, then
disappeared into the Hyderpora enclave. Four of them hid in newly
constructed vacant houses, witnesses and police said.
	   Soldiers cordoned off the area and ordered the militants to
surrender, police said. They then opened fire at the militants, who
responded with gunfire. Four militants were killed and three
soldiers were injured. Senior police officials were at the scene
commanding the operation.
	   Police earlier said five militants were killed, but blamed it
wrong information.
	   Several houses were damaged in the exchange. One building in
which the militants were hiding was almost completely destroyed
when soldiers fired rockets into the house in an attempt to flush
them out, said Paramjit Singh Gill, the inspector-general of police
of Srinagar.
	   Gill denied allegations by residents of the area that the house
was dynamited after police recovered the bodies of the guerrillas.
	   Police were trying to establish the identity of the militants,
he said.
	   Dozens of separatist rebel groups have been fighting security
forces in India's intractable northern Kashmir state since 1989.
More than 15,000 people have been killed and thousands have been
displaced in the fighting.

 &UR; Leftist extremists gun down seven in eastern India &QL;

<TEXT>
	   RAMPUR, India (AP) _ Leftist extremists gunned down seven people
believed to be members of an outlawed upper caste militia, police
said Monday.
	   The killings on Sunday night appeared to be in revenge for the
deaths in July of rebels from the People's Unity group, police
said.
	   The People's Unity is one of several groups fighting for the
redistribution of land among landless peasants and for the
establishment of a Maoist-Leninist state in central and eastern
India.
	   The victims in the killings belonged to the Ranbir Sena, a
militia of upper caste Hindus who work for landlords in the
predominantly feudal state of Bihar. Members of the Sena are
believed responsible for massacres of lower caste Hindus, many of
whom are subsistence farmers or bonded laborers in huge farms run
by upper caste landlords.
	   The Sena was blamed for killing 62 villagers last year close to
the site of Sunday's killings.
	   Police said the extremists raided Rampur village late Sunday and
fired point blank at the victims. Four of them were members of one
family believed to be involved in the July killings.
	   Local residents said eight people were abducted by the attackers
but police had no confirmation.
	   The extremists also attacked another neighboring village,
Ahyara, but details were not immediate available.
	   The two attacks came just hours after India's prime minister,
Atal Bihari Vajpayee, finished a tour of the region. His ruling
Bharatiya Janata Party says the state, ruled by a regional party,
is India's most lawless and has been pressing for the dismissal of
the state government.
	   Angered by the killings, villagers refused to allow police to
take away the bodies for several hours and did not file a police
complaint to express their loss of confidence in the
administration.
	   ``This is a war of supremacy and we are tired of this kind of
mindless killing,'' said Raghubir Singh, a resident of Rampur.
	   Women sat in groups crying while men in groups stood stony faced
The area was tense and dozens of policemen were posted to prevent
violence.

IMF demands more talks with Ukraine before disbursing aid
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund will send
another mission to Ukraine before deciding whether to continue
disbursing a dlrs 2.2 billion loan to the former Soviet republic, a
fund official said Monday.
	   An IMF team finished negotiations with the Ukrainian government
in Kiev last week, but left the country without announcing whether
Ukraine qualified for the next tranche of the loan, which was
approved in September.
	   ``There will be another mission to Ukraine'' before the fund
considers further disbursement, Patrick Lenain, head of the IMF's
Kiev office, said by telephone.
	   Lenain said the date for the next visit has not been set.
	   After last week's talks, the IMF expressed concerns over the
government's failure to raise enough revenues, and said reforms in
the key sectors of Ukrainian economy _ energy and agriculture _ and
administrative reform were going too slowly.
	   The fund also criticized Ukraine's proposals for a limited money
emission to pay off some government debts, saying in a statement
Friday that ``would risk aggravating the financial situation.''
	   Ukraine has already received about dlrs 240 million of the IMF's
three-year loan since September, but each new tranche is
conditioned on the government's step-by-step implementation of a
reform program agreed with the fund.
	   ``Further resources from the IMF are likely to be disbursed as
soon as'' the government introduces all the required reforms, the
fund's statement said.
	   Ukraine's leaders have said recently they want the IMF to soften
its lending conditions, namely those concerning tax collection and
social welfare payments, because the cash-strapped government is
unlikely to implement them.
	   The government is owed more than 8 billion hryvna (dlrs 2.3
billion) in unpaid taxes, while wage and pension debts have been
steadily rising for years and have reached 6.5 billion hryvna (dlrs
1.9 billion).
	   Ukraine maintains it needs foreign aid to repay its mounting
foreign debt before it can improve tax collection and introduce
reforms needed to boost economic growth.
	   The continuing economic crisis in Ukraine has been aggravated by
the recent turmoil in neighboring Russia and has scared away
private foreign investors.

U.S. Supreme Court issues two rulings against Clinton in Lewinsky
</HEADLINE>
case &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: Combines previous, with additional detail throughout &QL; 
 &UR; By RICHARD CARELLI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday issued two
rulings unfavorable to President Bill Clinton in the Monica
Lewinsky investigation.
	   The court let stand a ruling that said presidential confidant
Bruce Lindsey and other White House lawyers cannot refuse to answer
a federal grand jury's questions about possible criminal conduct by
government officials.
	   In a separate case, the court refused to shield Secret Service
agents from having to testify before federal grand juries about
information they learn while protecting the president.
	   Both rulings were on a 7-2 vote of the high court.
	   Rejecting a White House appeal that stemmed from investigation
of the president's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, the court turned
away arguments that the attorney-client privilege of
confidentiality extends to a president's White House lawyers.
	   A federal appeals court panel ruled in July that Lindsey cannot
invoke the privilege ``to withhold information relating to a
federal criminal offense.'' The court let that ruling stand.
	   In the Secret Service case, the court turned away Clinton
administration arguments that such a ``protective-function
privilege'' for the Secret Service is needed to ward off
presidential assassins.
	   A federal judge and a three-judge appeals court previously ruled
against the administration's claim of privilege for the Secret
Service, and more than a dozen agents testified before the grand
jury investigating the Lewinsky matter.
	   In the lawyer-privilege case, the justices were told, ``We stand
now upon the brink of the most serious confrontation between
branches of government contemplated in our constitutional order.
	   ``The president's need for confidential consultations with White
House counsel in preparation for proceedings designed to remove him
from office can scarcely be questioned,'' the justices were told by
W. Neil Eggleston, a private lawyer for Clinton, and by White House
lawyer Charles Ruff.
	   The appeals court panel ruled that the privilege does not apply
to the official legal advice given by government lawyers.
	   Lindsey, who advised Clinton throughout the Lewinsky
investigation conducted by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, has
appeared before a federal grand jury four times, most recently in
August. He has refused to answer certain questions each time.
	   Two other White House lawyers also have balked at answering
Starr's questions.
	   Starr's office had argued in the appeals court that the need for
relevant evidence of encouraging perjury, obstruction of justice or
witness tampering overrode the White House's claim of lawyer-client
confidentiality.
	   After the other appeals court's ruling allowed Starr and his
staff to interrogate Secret Service members, at least one uniformed
officer was asked about an incident in which he and a White House
aide supposedly found Ms. Lewinsky and the president alone in the
Oval Office suite.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico's ruling party on Monday appeared
headed for strong weekend victories in two gubernatorial elections
but it was narrowly trailing in a state once considered a
stronghold.
	   The Institutional Revolutionary Party, the longest-governing
party in the Western hemisphere, was winning with 54 percent of the
vote in Puebla state to 33 percent for the conservative National
Action Party, according to exit polls by two television networks on
Sunday. Actual vote counting was plagued by delays.
	   In northwestern state of Sinaloa, with 51 percent of the vote
counted, the ruling party led with 47 percent of the vote to 31
percent for National Action.
	   But National Action state chairman Rafael Morgan Rios said he
would seek to annul the election in Sinaloa because of alleged
irregularities. ``We do not accept defeat,'' he said late Sunday.
	   A coalition led by the left-center Democratic Revolution Party,
or PRD, held a narrow lead in the small central state of Tlaxcala
on Monday with 73 percent of votes counted.
	   Its candidate, Alfonso Sanchez Anaya, had 114,776 votes to
103,679 for Joaquin Cisneros of the PRI, which suffered divisions
over the nomination of its candidate in the state where opposition
parties have rarely done well.
	   The PRI has won five of seven gubernatorial elections this year
and Sunday's elections may help it gather momentum toward
presidential elections in 2000.
	   ``The triumphs obtained today by the PRI are a source of
encouragement,'' party chairman Mariano Palacios Alcocer said.
	   Voting was mostly calm in the four states, although attempted
vote-buying was reported in Sinaloa. Witnesses said PRI and
National Action activists offered money to those who would vote for
their candidates.

Israeli air attack after guerrilla ambush in South Lebanon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Israeli confirmation of raid

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes fired at least one
missile at suspected guerrilla bases in southern Lebanon Monday,
Lebanese security officials said.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the afternoon
raid on a valley between the Shiite Muslim villages of Yater and
Jebal al-Boutom.
	   The area, around 15 kilometers (nine miles) south of the port
city of Tyre, is often used by Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas
to launch attacks on Israeli troops occupying a border enclave in
South Lebanon.
	   In Israel, the military confirmed the raid, saying the jets
struck ``terrorist positions'' in southern Lebanon.
	   The air attack came after Hezbollah guerrillas ambushed an
Israeli outpost at Blatt, some three kilometers (2 miles) north of
the Israeli border, the Lebanese officials said. They spoke on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   A Hezbollah statement said the mortar attack caused ``definite
casualties.'' There was no immediate word from Israel on the
guerrilla attack.
	   On Sunday, Israeli helicopters and artillery fired on suspected
guerrilla hideouts after Lebanese guerrillas attacked
Israeli-backed militiamen in the south.
	   Hezbollah leads a guerrilla war to oust some 1,500 Israeli
soldiers and 2,500 allied Lebanese militiamen from the enclave,
which Israel established in 1985 to guard against cross-border
guerrilla attacks.

Travelers face hectic week of strikes in Italy

 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with Rome bus and tram strikes called off but new

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A nationwide strike by airport ground workers forced
cancellation or rescheduling of scores of flights at Italian
airports Monday, one of a series of walkouts this week that
promised to make travel in Italy tough going.
	   In Rome, taxi drivers began a four-day strike.
	   The airport walkout, from 12:30 p.m to 4:30 p.m. (1130-1530
gmt), forced the cancellation of about 100 flights at Rome's
Leonardo da Vinci airport and another 50 at Milan's Malpensa hub,
Italy's two biggest international airports.
	   Airport ground personnel are protesting failed contract talks
and difficult working conditions at revamped Malpensa, plagued by
days of chaos after the new hub opened Oct. 25.
	   Premier Massimo D'Alema said Monday that Malpensa's troubles
were ``just about resolved.''
	   But unions were quick to announce two more strikes by airport
workers, a four-hour walkout at Milan's, smaller Linate airport
Friday and a 24-hour nationwide strike Nov. 20.
	   The association of foreign airlines reportedly complained to
Italy's transport minister to complain that the strikes are hurting
their business.
	   Authorities in Rome banned a strike by the city's bus, tram and
subway drivers which had been scheduled for Thursday and Friday,
saying the strike should be held at a later date because of the
overlap with the taxi walkout.
	   Taxi drivers who are angry at the mayor's plans to make their
hours more flexible and liberalize tariffs have struck for several
days off and on starting in October. This week they plan to leave
their cabs parked from Monday through Thursday.
	   Train workers plan a nationwide, 24-hour strike starting 9 p.m.
(2000 gmt) Nov. 16.

New German government unveils promised tax cut plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's new center-left government
presented a 15 billion mark (dlrs 8.9 billion) tax cut Monday, the
first step toward tackling its biggest challenge: bringing down
unemployment.
	   A day before Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's inaugural speech to
parliament, the bill overhauled a widely criticized initial plan,
adding another 5 billion marks in tax relief by and allowing
business to keep important exemptions for now.
	   Economists, business leaders and the opposition had given the
original proposal poor marks, saying it only redistributed the high
taxes that hurt German competitiveness and actually increased the
load on small and medium-size firms.
	   Schroeder, who won September elections on a pledge to get
Germans back to work, pressed for the changes to keep the momentum
behind a promised reform that will help determine his government's
success.
	   Still, the administration's messy debut has raised questions
about who has the upper hand _ Schroeder, who campaigned as a
pro-market centrist, or Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine, an
old-style leftist who stresses a strong social welfare state.
	   The government says the proposal going to parliament Tuesday is
designed to spur growth and create jobs, provide tax relief for
workers and families, and simplify Germany's complex tax code.
	   Analysts say it benefits people with low income more than the
middle class. Corporate taxes would be lowered, but the government
would reap much of the gain by curbing or ending more than 70
loopholes and tax breaks.
	   Responding to business criticism, the final plan delays the
dropping of certain tax breaks for firms for loss-making years.
	   That revision ``is an important signal that we don't intend to
bring small and medium-sized companies into difficulty,'' said
Barbara Hendricks, a senior finance ministry official.
	   Key exemptions will end in 2002, though, to be balanced by a cut
in corporate taxes to 35 percent from the current 47 percent.
	   The top individual income tax rate, currently 53 percent, will
fall in stages to 48.5 percent in 2002. Low earners will pay 19.9
percent that year, compared to 25.6 percent now.
	   Under the plan released Monday by the Finance Ministry, nearly
all of the tax relief will come in 2002, the last year of the
administration's four-year term.
	   Schroeder's Social Democrats and his junior coalition partner,
the ecology-minded Greens, also cleared the way Monday for another
new source of government money _ a Jan. 1 rise in energy prices.
	   Lafontaine said the parties will waive the tax hike for
energy-guzzling industries such as steel and automakers and lighten
it for other industries.
	   Tax cuts were blocked under the previous government of Helmut
Kohl because the Social Democrats, then in the opposition, held
them up in the upper house of parliament. Lawmakers are to take up
the new government's bill Friday.

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Soccer legends Pele, Bobby Charlton,
Franz Beckenbauer and Michel Platini met Monday with FIFA President
Sepp Blatter for discussions on a new panel to address
``fundamental issues facing the game.''
	   The four will be members of the FIFA Football Committee, which
will be chaired by Spanish soccer federation president Angel Maria
Villar.
	   It should be formally set up in December and will also include
current players, referees, coaches, managers and doctors, the world
governing body said in a statement.
	   The new committee should meet four or five times a year. It will
not discuss the laws of soccer but will concentrate on ``the future
welfare of the game in more general terms,'' Blatter said.
	   The visit followed a personal initiative by the Brazilian Pele,
who had requested a meeting with Blatter to discuss future
cooperation, FIFA said.
	   ``It is essential that football remains in the hands of football
people to ensure the game's long-term viability,'' Platini said.
	   Faced with the threat of a breakaway independent Super League,
European governing body UEFA has moved to revamp its club
competitions.
	   BSkyB's planned takeover of English club Manchester United,
which has been referred to Britain's Monopolies and Mergers
Commission, has sparked speculation about the possibility of a
series of takeovers of soccer teams by media companies.
	   ``It's vital that the professional sector of football uses its
resources and expertise to help the smaller federations,''
Germany's Beckenbauer said.
	   ``The good image of the game itself is the responsibility of all
of us.''

East German activists demand return of spy files from CIA
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Former leaders of the anti-communist opposition in
East Germany demanded on Monday that Washington return files
allegedly taken from the East German spy agency shortly after the
Berlin Wall fell.
	   On the ninth anniversary of the Wall's opening, the activists
delivered a letter to the U.S. Embassy in Berlin, addressed to
President Bill Clinton, charging that so-called Stasi files
``through various means'' ended up at the CIA.
	   German officials are not allowed access to the files, they
claimed, adding that the documents may contain the names of not yet
unmasked Stasi spies and informers.
	   ``It's possible that the political origins of many people now in
responsible positions in politics and business would become more
transparent through the opening of these files,'' said director
Freya Klier, one of 20 activists who signed the letter.
	   Asked Friday about the pending letter, CIA spokesman Mike
Mansfeld refused to comment or to say whether the CIA even had
Stasi files in its possession.
	   As East Germany's secret police, the Stasi was feared for
enforcing communist rule. After the Berlin Wall fell, East Germany
merged with the west in 1990.

FIFA head again criticizes organization of next World Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The head of soccer's governing body has again
called it a mistake to give the 2002 World Cup jointly to Japan and
South Korea.
	   ``It is not something that should be repeated,'' Sepp Blatter,
the head of FIFA, told the daily Le Figaro in an interview
published Monday.
	   ``Ask the Belgians and the Dutch if they are happy to organize
jointly the coming Euro (European championships). If they are
honest, they will say no. Not together.''
	   ``After the opening match, who gets the final? And also, there
is a real tradition of antipathy between Korea and Japan,'' Blatter
was quoted as saying.
	   Blatter, who took over this year from Joao Havelange, also
repeated his backing for holding the 2006 World Cup in Africa.
	   Last month, Blatter dealt a blow to England's hopes of hosting
the 2006 tournament when he told Prime Minister Tony Blair that
Africa was the logical choice for soccer's showcase.
	   ``That continent has the right to organize the World Cup because
of all it has offered soccer,'' he told Le Figaro.
	   Bidding opens this month and England, South Africa and Germany
are regarded as the main contenders.
	   The winner will be announced in March 2000 after a vote by a
24-member FIFA committee.

Ethiopia accepts 11-point OAU proposal; Eritrea says no progress at
</HEADLINE>
summit &QL; 
 &UR; By ABEBE ANDUALEM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Ethiopia said Monday it has
accepted an 11-point OAU proposal to break the impasse in the
Ethiopia-Eritrea border conflict, but Eritrea said no real progress
had been made at a weekend summit in Burkina Faso.
	   Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin said Ethiopia had accepted the
proposal that calls on Eritrea to deploy its troops outside two
contested border areas.
	   Both Ethiopian Premier Meles Zenawi and Eritrean President
Isaias Afwerki _ former comrades in arms in the fight to oust the
dictatorship of Ethiopian leader Mengistu Haile Mariam _ attended
the summit convened in Ouagadougou by the current chairman of the
Organization of African Unity, Burkina President Blaise Campaore.
	   The presidents of Zimbabwe and Djibouti, Robert Mugabe and
Hassan Gouled Aptidon, served as mediators with Campaore.
	   ``We were hoping the OAU would come out with something
realistic, but unfortunately it was a non-starter,'' Eritrean
presidential adviser Yemane Gebremeskel told reporters in the
Eritrean capital, Asmara.
	   Seyoum said Ethiopia had accepted the key proposal on troop
redeployment after clarification from the OAU triumvirate that it
was calling on Eritrea to withdraw to positions it held before May
12 when Ethiopian militia shot Eritrean soldiers they claimed had
occupied Ethiopian territory.
	   Yemane said Ethiopia's demand _ now apparently the OAU's as well
_ that Eritrea unilaterally withdraw from the contested Badme and
Shiraro areas remains the main stumbling block to a peaceful
solution.
	   Eritrea wants an international monitoring force in place before
any troop withdrawal takes place.
	   Eritrea had earlier called for direct talks between Isaias and
Meles but has recently backed away from that position.
	   ``We are interested in substantive results, whether direct or
indirect,'' Yemane said.
	   The OAU gave Eritrea until the end of December to respond
officially to the proposals.
	   Yemane said Eritrea had hoped that the summit would at least
come up with an explicit agreement on the cessation of hostilities.
	   Serious fighting broke out in early June with hundreds of deaths
on both sides. Since then a de facto cease-fire has been in effect,
although there have been sporadic artillery exchanges at the front
lines.
	   Anthony Lake, U.S. President Bill Clinton's envoy to the Horn of
Africa, was expected back Addis Ababa Wednesday and was to travel
to Asmara Thursday.
	   It was not clear whether Lake, who was in the region last month,
had anything new to propose.
	   The United States and Rwanda issued a peace initiative shortly
after the June fighting that closely reassembles the OAU's 11-point
proposal.

For Canada's abortion-rights movement, a season of fear
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ While veterans and civic leaders devote
Wednesday's national holiday to honoring fallen soldiers,
Remembrance Day has become a chilling vigil for Canadians in the
front lines of the abortion-rights movement.
	   There is immediate fear, because an anti-abortion gunman is
believed to be at large. And there is long-term anxiety, because
even in this country where abortions are legal and publicly funded,
women may find access diminishing.
	   There is speculation the sniper's timing is linked to
Remembrance Day because some anti-abortion activists use the day to
commemorate aborted fetuses.
	   Three times since 1994, a sniper has used this time of year to
fire into the home of a Canadian doctor who performs abortion, each
time wounding the target. The attacks were spread across Canada _
Ontario, Manitoba and British Columbia.
	   U.S. and Canadian investigators now believe those attacks were
linked to two shootings of abortion-providing doctors in upstate
New York, including the Oct. 23 slaying of Dr. Barnett Slepian at
his home near Buffalo.
	   An American anti-abortion activist, James Kopp, is wanted for
questioning about the shootings. Police say they don't know which
side of the border he is on, fueling uneasiness at clinics and
hospitals throughout Canada.
	   ``You must realize Canada has the largest undefended border in
the world,'' said Keith McCaskill, a police inspector in Winnipeg,
Manitoba, and spokesman for the investigation.
	   Many women's clinics have tightened security, and doctors who
provide abortions have been urged to take precautions.
	   ``I would suggest they be extremely aware of their day-to-day
goings on, whether during their business day or after hours,'' said
Toronto Detective Rick Stubbings.
	   Across Canada, there have been reports of
obstetrician-gynecologists modifying their practices or deciding to
stop performing abortions. Some wear bulletproof vests and hang
sheets over windows of their homes.
	   Abortion-rights groups say most doctors are not backing down.
	   ``There's a great deal of sadness,'' said Susan Fox, director of
a clinic in Edmonton, Alberta, that provides abortions. ``But
there's also a feeling of determination that we won't be deterred
or scared by these actions.''
	   Marilyn Wilson, executive director of the Canadian Abortion
Rights Action League, sees a long-term threat because fear of
violence may intimidate young doctors from entering the field.
	   ``There are almost no doctors who have stopped performing these
procedures, even under the current reign of terror,'' she said.
``But young doctors with families wouldn't necessarily want to do
this. They may not be willing to put their lives at risk.''
	   The abortion debate is only one of several factors contributing
to a shortage of obstetrician-gynecologists in Canada.
	   The national society that oversees the speciality says there are
about 1,400 doctors in the field, a shortfall of 600, and most are
in their 50s or 60s. The society says long hours and limits on fees
paid by the public health-care system are causing burnout and
deterring medical school graduates as they choose a specialty.
	   Another problem is that few Canadian medical schools offer
training in abortion.
	   Women in Canada's big cities generally have adequate access to
abortions. Those in rural areas often face long journeys, and the
province of Prince Edward Island prohibits abortions at its six
hospitals, forcing women there to travel to New Brunswick or Nova
Scotia.
	   Abortion-rights groups say the situation would improve if the
RU-486 abortion pill were available in Canada. No drug company has
applied for permission to market the pill, either fearing boycotts
or doubting its profitability.
	   The government has been urged to make a public appeal to drug
companies, but the health department says this can't be done.
	   ``It would be a conflict of interest,'' said Bonnie
Fox-McIntyre, a department spokeswoman. ``As a regulator we have to
stay at arm's length, so we can judge an application impartially.''
	   Abortion was illegal in Canada until 1988. Now there is no
abortion law of any sort, about 100,000 abortions are performed
annually, and polls indicate roughly three-quarters of Canadians
favor pro-choice policies.
	   Yet public support doesn't spare doctors from fear.
	   Dr. Henry Morgentaler, who led efforts to overturn the old
abortion law and whose Toronto clinic was bombed in 1993, says he
and his colleagues are sacrificing personal freedom as they
reluctantly increase security measures.
	   ``Unfortunately, doctors who are committed to providing these
services will have to accept a certain diminishment of their
enjoyment of life,'' he said.

Court frees defendant on bail in Polish bank scandal case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A musician-turned-businessman who fled
Poland in 1991 as a suspect in defrauding its central bank of 121
million dollars was released from jail Monday on half a million
dollars bail.
	   Boguslaw Bagsik, the former head of the Art-B corporation, was
accused of duping the banking system by creating phantom accounts
to rack up interest. A 1991 investigation into Art-B led to the
dismissal of the chairman of the country's central bank.
	   Bagsik fled Poland for Israel in July 1991 together with his
deputy, Andrzej Gasiorowski. Bagsik was arrested in 1994 in
Switzerland and extradited to Poland, where he has since been in
jail.
	   Along with five others, Bagsik has been on trial since February.
	   Prosecutors say Bagsik defrauded the central bank of some 424
million zlotys (dlrs 121 million) in Poland's biggest embezzlement
fraud since its 1991 transition to a market economy. He is also
charged with bribing a banking official.
	   Bagsik, as well as Gasiorowski, who remains in Israel, has
denied any wrongdoing. The Warsaw Provincial Court decided to free
Bagsik after January Goscimski, representing a group of Polish
businessmen, paid the bail Monday.
	   In 1991, Art-B, a private company dealing in tractors,
televisions and other products, shot to public attention with its
meteoric success.
	   According to Bagsik, the company grew from a dlrs 100 investment
in 1989 to a corporation worth dlrs 500 million with 15,000
employees. It expanded rapidly in the early days of post-communist
Poland's new market economy.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A visiting Irish politician said Monday he
believes Iraq is willing to compromise to head off threatened
military action over suspended U.N. weapons inspections, but
Britain's defense secretary said time was running out.
	   Iraq announced on Oct. 31 that it was halting cooperation with
international inspectors until the Security Council begins moving
to lift the sanctions imposed to punish Iraq for its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait. The devastating sanctions, which ban the sale of oil and
other financial dealings, can only be lifted once inspectors
certify that Iraq has destroyed its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Former Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds appealed to the
United States and Britain to abandon threats of a military strike
and to negotiate a settlement.
	   ``We believe that with good will on both sides, that a
compromise could be worked out,'' he said.
	   Reynolds, a member of the Irish Parliament, was credited with
encouraging the Irish Republic Army's 1994 cease-fire. He planned
to leave Iraq later Monday and said he would travel to the United
States on Thursday to confer with American politicians.
	   But Britain's Defense Secretary George Robertson on a visit to
Kuwait said the world's patience with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein
is ``draining away.''
	   A diplomatic solution to resolve the crisis is ``still
possible'' but the ``option of force is there, is real,'' Robertson
told reporters in Kuwait where Britain has stationed 12 Tornado
bombers.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton met Sunday with top security
advisers, but put off a decision on whether to use force against
Iraq to reopen military sites to U.N. inspectors.
	   Reynolds said he met with Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq
Aziz, for more than two hours on Sunday. He described Aziz as
``open'' and ``very flexible.''
	   Reynolds said: ``Today I would like to send a very clear message
and a clear call to the United Nations, to President Clinton and to
(British) Prime Minister Tony Blair that whatever (their feelings)
about the conflict, that everybody gets around the table to
dialogue and debate and talk to remove the sanctions.''
	   He suggested that the United Nations lift sanctions on medicine
to let supplies into Iraq.
	   Reynolds suggested that the United Nations lift restrictions on
the import of medicine to allow a free flow of pharmaceutical
supplies into Iraq.
	   U.N. sanctions do not bar the import of medicines to Iraq, but a
U.N. committee carefully screens all imports to Iraq. Baghdad
repeatedly has claimed that the screening has led to serious
delays.

Portuguese privatization raises dlrs 797 million
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ The government Monday raised 136 billion
escudos (dlrs 797 million) through the privatization of a 31
percent stake in the national highway operator Brisa _
Auto-Estradas de Portugal.
	   The share issue, which was the last major sell-off of the year,
brought total revenue for privatizations in 1998 to some 785
billion escudos (dlrs 4.5 billion).
	   ``Once again the strength of the Portuguese capital market has
been demonstrated by a highly successful share offer, this time in
particularly difficult international market conditions,'' the
Secretary of State for Finances, Fernando Teixeira dos Santos,
said.
	   The revenue goes mostly to paying off the public debt which the
government estimates will fall to 58 percent of gross domestic
product this year, down from 61.5 percent last year.

Five reported killed in attack on Canadian-owned mine in Angola

	   TORONTO (AP) _ Armed men staged a hit-and-run attack on a
Canadian-owned diamond mine in Angola, killing at least five
employees and taking four others hostage, the company reported
Monday.
	   DiamondWorks Ltd. said the attack occurred early Sunday at its
Yetwene mine in northeastern Angola.
	   ``Preliminary reports indicate that, despite resistance by the
company's security contractors, five of the company's operating
personnel were killed by the assailants,'' the Vancouver-based
company said.
	   ``Four expatriate company personnel are reportedly being held
captive by the attackers and a further two remain unaccounted
for.''
	   It said 18 Angolan workers were wounded in the attack. The
remaining 13 foreign workers were unharmed and have been flown to
Angola's capital, Luanda, DiamondWorks said.
	   The identities of the slain and missing workers, including their
nationality, were not disclosed.
	   The identities of the attackers have not been confirmed.
	   Initial reports from the mine indicate that there was some theft
and minor damage to vehicles and communication systems. However,
the company said mining equipment and the diamond processing plant
were not damaged and the diamond inventory was safe.
	   Officials said it was not possible to say when production will
resume. The Yetwene mine has been producing between 5,000 and 6,000
carats a month, about 50 percent the company's total diamond
production.

Arrest of suspected Israeli spies prompts Israeli assurances

	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Israel on Monday tried to repair any
damage done to relations with Cyprus after the weekend arrest of
two Israelis on suspicion of spying for the Greek Cypriot
government's enemy, Turkey.
	   Israeli President Ezer Weizman, who visited Cyprus three days
before the Israelis' arrest Saturday, sent his Cypriot counterpart
a ``message of friendship,'' Israeli Ambassador Shemi Tzur told
reporters.
	   ``We do hope that this cloud which appeared this last weekend
will leave us and we will continue our good relations,'' Tzur said
	   The Justice Ministry said Sunday evening that the men have not
been linked to Israel's government, but an investigation continues.
	   Police officials have said privately that the Israelis probably
were gathering information for Turkey, which maintains 35,000
troops in the Turkish-occupied northern third of the Mediterranean
island.
	   Israel has not denied the men worked for its Mossad intelligence
agency. Asked Sunday if they were Israeli agents, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said, ``Every Israeli citizen is important to
us. We'll clarify this, and of course we'll bring them home.''
	   The two Israelis were seized in an apartment in the fishing
village of Ziyi, halfway between the coastal cities of Larnaca and
Limassol. They appeared in court and were ordered held for eight
days for a police investigation.
	   A police statement said that the two were suspected of spying on
the Cypriot National Guard and that cameras, recordings of police
radio messages, radio scanners and maps were found in the
apartment.
	   Cyprus has been split into a Greek Cypriot-controlled south and
a Turkish-occupied north since Turkey invaded the island in 1974,
following an abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece.

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ A left-wing coalition led by a former
coup leader has become the top force in Venezuela's new Congress,
initial results showed Monday, in a major setback for the two
political parties that have governed for 40 years since the
restoration of democracy.
	   With 67 percent of Sunday's vote counted, Hugo Chavez's
Patriotic Pole coalition won 34 percent of the congressional seats.
The center-left Democratic Action Party won about 22 percent, and
the conservative Copei Party won 11 percent.
	   The pro-business Project Venezuela emerged with about 12 percent
of the vote.
	   The 44-year-old Chavez, an independent supported by millions of
peasants and shantytown dwellers, is the favorite to win the Dec. 6
presidential election.
	   In 1992, he staged an unsuccessful military revolt against the
government and became a hero to many for denouncing corruption and
speaking out on behalf of the poor. He spent two years in prison
and was released in 1994 by President Rafael Caldera.
	   Investors reacted negatively to the strong electoral showing by
his coalition, with the Caracas stock exchange dropping 3.2 percent
Monday morning.
	   Many investors and businessmen fear Chavez will reverse
free-market policies implemented during the last two years by
President Rafael Caldera.

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Criminal prosecutions for
atrocities committed during the war against white rule could drag
on for at least six years, a top prosecutor said Monday.
	   Key figures implicated in human rights abuses by the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission already are under investigation, the
official, Jan d'Oliveira, told reporters.
	   They include two unnamed generals in the apartheid state's
security apparatus, President Nelson Mandela's ex-wife Winnie
Madikizela-Mandela and officials of the African National Congress,
he said.
	   The remarks by d'Oliveira, who recently was appointed a deputy
national director of prosecutions, were the clearest signal yet
that criminal cases would be brought against figures accused by the
commission of gross human rights violations.
	   The commission released its report Oct. 30. It chronicles the
human rights abuses committed by apartheid governments and their
operatives as well as by the African National Congress and others
fighting the racist system.
	   The issue of continuing prosecutions is significant. Many feel
that dragging on criminal reckonings of the horrors of the
apartheid era will only prolong bitterness and delay
reconciliation. But supporters of prosecution feel that denying
justice to the victims is a worse evil.
	   On a practical level, highly public prosecutions of ANC figures
could have an impact on national elections next year, when the
party will seek to consolidate its hold on power.
	   The panel's chairman, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, has called for a
two-year time limit on prosecutions; d'Oliveira called the period
``wholly impractical.''
	   The prosecutor did not name the other targets. ``We have always
worked on the principle of that we will prosecute the highest
rank,'' he said.
	   The commission has the ability to grant amnesty to those who
admit their misdeeds and are found to have acted with political
motives. The report said individuals who have not sought amnesty
should be prosecuted.
	   Madikizela-Mandela has not sought amnesty. The commission found
her accountable for human rights violations committed by her
bodyguards, who the report said killed and tortured suspected
opponents.
	   Madikizela-Mandela was convicted in 1991 of kidnapping and being
an accessory to an assault on four young men. She was sentenced to
six years in jail, but paid a dlrs 3,200 fine on appeal. The ANC
official was among the most prominent anti-apartheid activists.
	   The two generals were implicated during Truth Commission
testimony. Prosecutors are ready to move forward pending the
amnesty application of one.

EU: food aid of $480 million, humanitarian aid of $8.4 million for
</HEADLINE>
Russia
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments throughout; TRIMS pvs &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union is cobbling together
plans to grant Russia dlrs 480 million in food aid though some EU
nations raised questions Monday about giving food to a country that
still exports wheat and where evidence of food shortages is spotty.
	   The EU executive Commission also proposed a package of
humanitarian assistance for Russia of dlrs 8.4 million.
	   On food aid, it proposed a package of cereals, meat and milk
powder to be sold in Russia at market prices with the proceeds
going into a fund to finance social projects.
	   The EU would pay its farmers for the food delivered to Russia.
The value of the aid would be 400 million European currency units
(dlrs 480 million).
	   The EU plan _ broadly endorsed at a meeting here of the EU
foreign ministers _ was put forward four days after the United
States announced it would provide Russia with food aid worth dlrs
600 million.
	   ``It is a clear signal of our political and material support for
Russia,'' EU Foreign affairs Commissioner Hans van den Broek told
reporters. He added, ``We need to ensure that this (EU) aid reaches
its destination and that it does not distort traditional trade
flows.''
	   Russia was expected to formally request food aid in a matter of
days. EU officials will go to Moscow this week to examine projects
that could receive humanitarian assistance.
	   Russia will be held to strict conditions, officials said. It
must provide anti-fraud guarantees, it cannot re-export EU food and
must ensure the food reaches the needy.
	   The EU ``looks to the Russian government to take the
administrative measures necessary to facilitate'' distribution of
the aid, the foreign ministers said.
	   The EU foreign ministers did not debate the measure in detail
but the Netherlands and Britain suggested the EU tread carefully.
	   ``There is not a general food shortage in Russia,'' said Dutch
Foreign Minister Jozias van Aartsen. ``We have to be careful.
Russia is still selling grain on world markets.''
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said ``evidence is
conflicting'' as to size of food shortages across Russia.
	   He said ``generalized food shortages'' may come only after the
New Year adding it was right for the EU to plan now since it will
take two months before the first shipments will reach Russia.
	   It was expected the EU package will be finalized in the weeks
ahead to give the EU leaders the opportunity to make a formal
announcement when they meet Dec. 11-12 in Vienna, Austria.
	   The EU stock of surplus grain is currently about 10 million
tons. In addition it has some 500,000 tons of beef and 400,000 tons
of rice in surplus stocks.
	   Russia has been hit hard by economic problems coupled with the
worst grain harvest in 40 years. Food prices have risen 50 percent
due to the financial crisis, prompting worries that the poor won't
be able to afford food.
	   Russian officials have said their emergency reserve will last
only two to three weeks.

FIFA: postponement could bring France back into Confederations Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Postponement of the Confederations
Cup, scheduled for January, is being considered and could persuade
world champion France to take part, a FIFA spokesman said Monday.
	   France last month pulled out of the event after many European
clubs and domestic leagues made it clear they didn't want to
release their French players for the event, which comes in the
middle of league seasons.
	   ``There is a consensus among the participants that postponement
would be possible'' and that consequently ``French participation
would be possible,'' FIFA spokesman Andreas Herren said.
	   A final decision on dates for the tournament will be made Nov.
17, Herren said. If the tournament is postponed, it will likely
take place in late July or early August, he added.
	   Some regard the event as an unneeded one that exhausts already
burned out players.
	   ``Les Bleus'' were scheduled to represent Europe in the
competition, along with teams from Brazil, Mexico, Bolivia, the
United States, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Australia.
	   Roger Lemerre, the new coach of the French team, had been in
favor of the French team's participation, which would have allowed
him to test out new players.

EU debates rearranging Central America debt to help crisis-hit

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - European Union foreign ministers on
Monday considered granting debt relief to Central American nations
hit by Hurricane Mitch as part of an aid package to help them
overcome the devastation.
	   EU foreign ministers said the EU should unblock further
emergency aid for
	   Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua, where torrential
rains and mudslides have killed an estimated 10,000 people and left
tens of thousands of others without food and shelter.
	   Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel, whose country
currently holds the EU presidency, said the Union and its the 15
member nations have pledged over dlrs 70 million so far in
humanitarian aid for Central America.
	   But over the past few days the extent of the devastation has
proved to be
	   greater than expected. German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer
told reporters urgent measures are needed to provide victims with
basic aid, including medicine, water sanitation and shelter.
	   The ministers were debating the possibility of unblocking
emergency funds from the EU's common foreign and security policy
budget.
	   In the longer term, the ministers have asked the EU executive
Commission to come up with a series of proposals to help
reconstruction. These measures could include forgiving the
country's foreign debts or delaying their reimbursement.
	   ``It's an interesting proposal but it's not the only one,''
Ramon de Miguel, Spain's state secretary for foreign affairs.
	   The four Central American countries have foreign debts totaling
around dlrs 20 billion, mainly to international lending agencies.
Honduras owes dlrs 4.2 billion and Nicaragua owes dlrs 6 billion.
	   De Miguel said the ministers have asked the EU executive
Commission to come forward with a series of proposals by November
30, when development ministers are scheduled to meet in Brussels.
	   Both De Miguel and Fischer stressed that the EU and the United
States should coordinate aid efforts for the stricken region.

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ As disease and starvation
threatened to raise the death toll from Hurricane Mitch, Central
American leaders were flying Monday to El Salvador to coordinate
strategies for feeding tens of thousands of survivors and plan a
regional recovery.
	   The leaders of Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador and
Costa Rica were expected to appeal to financial organizations to
forgive their foreign debts so they can focus on recovery.
	   With French President Jacques Chirac due to visit Central
America next week, French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin on Monday
called for a moratorium on debt payments owed by countries hit by
Hurricane Mitch.
	   French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn said the Paris
Club of creditor nations should suspend debt service payments for
the next two to three years for the countries hit hardest by the
hurricane.
	   European foreign ministers meeting Monday in Brussels also were
discussing increases in the dlrs 8.2 million they have already
approved for Mitch's victims.
	   Relief agencies desperate to feed tens of thousands isolated by
Hurricane Mitch struggled to deliver tons of food, despite ruptured
roads, backed-up airports and too few helicopters.
	   Hunger and disease threaten to raise the death toll from Mitch,
which Central American officials estimate has killed more than
10,000 in the region. If confirmed, that would make Mitch among the
five worst hurricanes ever recorded in the Caribbean.
	   ``The Honduran Red Cross is giving out all they have. Everything
incoming is absolutely necessary,'' American Red Cross spokeswoman
Ann Stingle said Sunday.
	   On Sunday, the first shipments of aid reached many hamlets and
cities cut off by flooding, such as Choluteca in southern Honduras
and Posoltega, Nicaragua, where an estimated 2,000 people were
killed in a mudslide.
	   But some were kept waiting.
	   ``We heard on the radio that aid is coming, but we're still
eating rice,'' said Ann Soto, 19, at a refugee shelter in
Posoltega.
	   Former President George Bush was in Tegucigalpa, the Honduran
capital, when more than 60,000 pounds (27,000 kilos) of aid from
the U.S. relief group Americares arrived Sunday. He said much more
would be needed for months _ maybe years _ to come.
	   ``I can tell the American people and the people of the world
that the devastation is appalling,'' Bush said after viewing damage
with Honduran President Carlos Flores.
	   The Central American leaders also planned to urge the United
States to keep postponing deportations of illegal immigrants,
Salvadoran Foreign Minister Ramon Gonzalez said Sunday.
	   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service temporarily
suspended deportations of immigrants to Honduras and Guatemala as a
``humanitarian gesture'' until Tuesday.
	   In Tegucigalpa, Bush and Flores said without sustained aid,
Central Americans struggling to survive could migrate north to the
United States. ``If people feel there is no hope for their families
they will go elsewhere. They will go north, if necessary,'' Flores
said.
	   In Honduras alone, 700,000 people will need food for the next
month, U.N. World Food Program representative Giuseppi Lubatti
estimated.
	   Honduran, U.S., Mexican and other authorities struggled to
overcome logistical problems in getting aid to remote areas. On
Sunday, a Mexican C-130 cargo plane blew a tire while landing in
Tegucigalpa, disrupting flights for several hours.
	   ``It's taken us a little time to get synchronized. Hopefully,
this will get a little better,'' said U.S. Army Lt. Col. Mike
Morales.
	   The first members of a Canadian military team specializing in
disaster relief were scheduled to leave on Monday for northern
Honduras, where they will establish an air traffic control system.
	   U.S. military engineers were sent to help repair roads and
bridges. U.S. forces also will help transport pipes into
Tegucigalpa to repair the water network, now running at 25 percent
capacity.
	   In Nicaragua, aid distribution has become highly politicized.
	   Victims have accused President Arnoldo Aleman of being slow to
help some of the worst-hit regions because inhabitants
overwhelmingly support leftist Sandinistas, the former rebels who
governed through the 1980s.
	   ``The government has shown a lack of competence and a lack of
responsibility,'' said former President Daniel Ortega, whose
Sandinista supporters drove dozens of truckloads of aid into
Posoltega on Sunday.
	   The military continued to dispose of hundreds of bodies of
people killed in the massive mudslides in northwestern Nicaragua.
Lt. Col. Juan Molinares, the army commander in charge of the
Posoltega region, said soldiers had burned or buried 538 corpses.
	   Mexican search teams continued to look for victims in river
banks and debris piles in Tegucigalpa.
	   Assisting a beleaguered Honduran Red Cross, the American Red
Cross was sending 40 tons of water purification chemicals and
antibiotics to stem the spread of disease.
	   ``We have nothing to drink,'' Argentina Giron, 30, said at a
Tegucigalpa shelter.

	   MALISEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A visiting U.S. war crimes envoy saw
first-hand evidence Monday of the ongoing violence in Kosovo _ the
apparently executed bodies of two Serb policemen.
	   David Scheffer, the roving U.S. ambassador on war crimes issues,
viewed the bodies in this devastated central village as he toured
Kosovo with the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission (KDOM).
	   The policemen _ Ilija Vujosevic and Dejan Djatlov _ disappeared
Friday, the same day that Serb police shot to death five ethnic
Albanian guerrillas, including a commander of two divisions.
	   Both of the slain policemen had gunshot wounds to the head,
indicating they had been killed execution-style.
	   It was unclear if their deaths were intended as retribution for
the killing of the five Kosovo Liberation Army members. The rebels
say police ambushed the five as they drove in two vehicles from
Opterusa village, while police claim the guerrillas opened fire
first on a police patrol.
	   Qamil Hajrizi, the father of one of the slain guerrillas, said
Monday that his son's body was riddled with bullets.
	   ``From what I saw, they were certainly ambushed,'' he said after
waiting about four hours to collect the body from a hospital morgue
in the southern city of Prizren. ``He was destroyed by many, many
bullets.''
	   Two teams of international observers helped Hajrizi, 50,
overcome intransigence by Serb police, who initially said the
father lacked the necessary paperwork to recover the remains. The
KDOM observers refused to speak to journalists.
	   A KLA figure called the killing of the five guerrillas an ambush
that violated a de facto cease-fire in Kosovo. Under a
four-week-old agreement between Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, Milosevic's forces were
supposed to cease hostilities.
	   The KLA was not a party to the Oct. 12 agreement, but has
declared its own unilateral cease-fire except in the case of
attacks by Serb and Yugoslav forces.
	   Violence by both sides has increased in the past week, including
at least three incidents in which police reported killing KLA
fighters who shot at them first. No police were killed or injured
in any of those incidents.
	   Scheffer and KDOM observers went to Malisevo to investigate the
report of the missing policemen as well as a gunbattle Sunday
night. Serb and Albanian accounts of who initiated that clash
differed, but neither side reported injuries.
	   Dozens of Serb police are believed to have been killed since the
start of a Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists last
February in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians make up about 90 percent
of the population. Several hundred other people, mostly ethnic
Albanians, have been killed, and as many as 300,000 driven from
their homes.
	   Scheffer came to Kosovo on a one-day fact-finding tour after
attending a panel discussion on war crimes in Belgrade.
	   His visit comes amid a continuing controversy over Yugoslav
authorities' failure to cooperate with the United Nations war
crimes panel trying to investigate allegations of atrocities in
Kosovo.
	   Louise Arbour, chief prosecutor for the International War Crimes
Tribunal, and a team of investigators planned a weeklong mission in
Kosovo to begin last Wednesday but were refused access to the
province.
	   Arbour and Scheffer have threatened Yugoslavia with U.N.
sanctions if the authorities continue to defy demands for unlimited
access.
	   ``The person who should be here is Louise Arbour, and she's been
prevented,'' Scheffer told reporters in Pristina, Kosovo's capital.
``It was critical that she be here'' along with the other
investigators, he said.
	   The American envoy, who will report back to Arbour and to U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, said he wanted to visit
destroyed villages and other flash points from the war during his
brief tour.
	   He also planned to meet later in Pristina with ethnic Albanian
leader Ibrahim Rugova and with a top Serb official.

East German Stasi documentation center opens in Berlin

	   BERLIN (AP) _ A new museum documenting the building of the
Berlin Wall opened Monday on the ninth anniversary of the day the
Wall fell.
	   The Information and Documentation Center on the former East
German state security apparatus, known as the Stasi, opened in a
building formerly used as East Germany's Interior Ministry.
	   It encapsulates how the Stasi worked, using excerpts from files,
film and tape recordings as well as tools and cameras once employed
by the secret police.
	   Along with the building of the Wall, which began in 1961, other
main topics addressed in exhibits range from travel restrictions on
East Germans to foreign spying.
	   Although similar documentation centers exist in other eastern
German cities, Berlin has had only a memorial in the former Stasi
headquarters, where visitors can see former Stasi chief Erich
Mielke's office, among other exhibits.
	   The Stasi employed about 91,000 people shortly before it was
shut down and had a network of 173,000 informers.

Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   Satellite photos early this morning showed a cold front
extending from the north coast of the Dominican Republic eastward
across our local Atlantic coastal waters about 20 miles north of
Puerto Rico.
	   The front continues east-northeast across the Atlantic and
offshore of St. Thomas and St. John. This front will continue a
slow and gradual southward motion throughout the day to bring
increasing cloudiness with scattered to numerous showers.
	   North and northwest sections of Puerto Rico and the Virgin
Islands will see intermittent showers during the morning hours.
There could be heavy rainfall leading to urban and stream flooding
as the front moves south across Puerto Rico this afternoon.
	   Cloudiness will increase across the interior south and southwest
of the island to produce numerous showers and isolated
thunderstorms. Isolated areas of heavy rainfall are expected, and
flash flooding will be possible. A decrease in late afternoon
showers will be seen across the Virgin Islands, with showers
increasing again tonight.
	   Northeast winds will increase throughout the day across the
region as the cold front moves over our islands. This will cause a
further increase in coastal seas, which are already at 6 to 7 feet
across the Atlantic due to moderate northwest swells.
	   High pressure over the western Atlantic behind the cold front
will build across the region through the middle of the week to
maintain strong northeast trade winds. Seas will gradually build to
8 to 10 feet.
	   A small craft advisory is in effect for all local waters except
the west coast of Puerto Rico and will likely remain in effect
through Friday.

	   OUDENAARDE, Belgium (AP) _ Among the endless rows of crosses in
cemeteries along the front lines of the Great War, few are more
poignant than those bearing the inscription ``Nov. 11, 1918'' _
Armistice Day.
	   After four years of unprecedented carnage, men kept falling
until the final hours of battle, long after the German enemy had
given up hope of winning the war.
	   The French army and the U.S. 37th and 91st Divisions launched
one of the final offensives of the 1914-1918 war around the town of
Oudenaarde on Nov. 10, trying to capture one more hill before the
arms were finally put down.
	   During the last 24 hours of fighting, the 37th Division alone
lost 22 men before the long-anticipated telegram came in _ ``By
direction of Marshal Foch, hostilities will cease at 11 h.'' The
Allies had won.
	   Just before 11 a.m., the German machine guns wailed one last
time before a blessed silence fell over the medieval town.
	   La Pomme D'Or restaurant got its remaining supplies out of the
cellar and served some of the troops Potage Victoire, or Victory
Soup, hare ragout and fine wines that had awaited the liberators
for four long years.
	   Sgt. Walter Lang of Ohio, 147th infantry, 37th Division, did not
make it. Nor did Cpl. Andrew B. Horrell of Illinois of the same
unit. Or Sgt. Edgar G. VanKirk of the 112th Engineers, another
Ohioan. They all died on the day of victory.
	   On Wednesday, these men and other 4,500 other Americans who died
in the last of weeks of fighting around here will be honored during
a ceremony at the city's war memorial.
	   In nearby Ypres, Belgian King Albert II and British Queen
Elizabeth II will honor the slain troops, over 10 million from a
host of nations.
	   The Belgian monarch's grandfather, Albert I, was supreme
commander of the Belgian troops during the Great War and witnessed
the American sacrifices firsthand.
	   ``Belgium will never forget your countrymen, who having neither
their fatherland nor their home to defend ran up to secure the
rights of humanity,'' Albert I wrote.
	   Their memory is now kept at the Flanders Field American Cemetery
outside Oudenaarde, where 368 of them lie buried.
	   Eighty years after that desperately miserable autumn, nature is
reenacting the bleak setting. On a November morning, leaden clouds
whipped overhead. The cemetery was waterlogged. A gale rippled huge
pools of mud in surrounding fields. Thick, black clay spilled onto
the narrow roads.
	   In 1918, the air was heavy with rumors of impending peace but
Allied generals wanted to pressure the Germans as much as possible
before a cease-fire was signed, so they continued to push their
battle-weary troops forward.
	   The U.S. troops joined a French division west of Oudenaarde and
launched an offensive on the Scheldt River on Oct. 31.
	   The infantry, dragging heavy equipment, got stuck in the mud and
German machine-gun posts fired with ruthless abandon. The advance
was costly and slow _ farm by farm, hedge by hedge, said retired
Belgian army Lt. Col. Dr. Jean-Pierre Deweer, who wrote a study on
the battle.
	   The American troops were easy targets for the Germans shooting
from the opposing hills. They also had to brave poison gas.
	   Soldiers had to duck fire as they swam the river before digging
foxholes that immediately filled with water. Men died from
pneumonia and infections.
	   Their suffering still hits home.
	   ``Lest we forget, God bless them,'' Mario Runco of the NASA
Johnson Space Center in Houston wrote in the Flanders Field visitor
books.

OSCE delegation arrives for Nagorno-Karabakh talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ U.S., French and Russian mediators
presented new proposals Monday to Azerbaijan's president for
settling the dispute over the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, a news
report said.
	   The three co-chairmen of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe's negotiating team arrived in Baku, the
Azerbaijani capital, on Monday for a new round of talks.
	   They met with Azerbaijani President Geidar Aliyev and presented
a plan giving broad autonomy to Nagorno-Karabakh, a mostly Armenian
enclave inside Azerbaijan, but maintaining Azerbaijan's territorial
integrity, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   A 1994 truce ended fighting that began in the late 1980s over
Nagorno-Karabakh, but OSCE-mediated efforts for a political
settlement have dragged and occasional skirmishes are still
reported.
	   The OSCE's latest proposals also pay special attention to
refugees displaced by the war between the neighboring former Soviet
republics, ITAR-Tass quoted the French chairman, Georges Vaugier,
as saying.
	   Vaugier and his co-chairmen, Donald Kaiser of the United States
and Yuri Yukalov of Russia, also are to visit the Armenian capital
Yerevan and Nagorno-Karabakh itself, ITAR-Tass said.

EU planning food, humanitarian aid package for Russia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union is cobbling together
plans to grant Russia dlrs 480 million (400 million European
currency units) in food aid though some EU nations raised questions
Monday about giving food to a country that still exports wheat.
	   The EU executive Commission also proposed a package of
humanitarian assistance for Russia of dlrs 8.4 million.
	   ``It is a clear signal of our political and material support for
Russia,'' EU Foreign affairs Commissioner Hans van den Broek told
reporters. He added, ``We need to ensure that this (EU) aid reaches
its destination and that it does not distort traditional trade
flows.''
	   Russia was expected to formally request food aid in a matter of
days. EU officials will go to Moscow this week to examine projects
that could receive humanitarian assistance.
	   On food aid, the EU proposed a package of cereals, meat and milk
powder to be sold in Russia at market prices with the proceeds
going to finance social projects.
	   The EU would pay its farmers for the food delivered to Russia.
The value of the aid would be 400 million European currency units
(dlrs 480 million).
	   The EU plan _ broadly endorsed at a meeting here of the EU
foreign ministers _ was put forward four days after the United
States announced it would provide Russia with food aid worth dlrs
600 million.
	   Russia will be held to strict conditions, officials said. It
must provide antifraud guarantees, it cannot re-export EU food and
must ensure the food reaches the needy.
	   The EU foreign ministers did not debate the measure in detail
but the Netherlands and Britain urged caution.
	   ``There is not a general food shortage in Russia,'' said Dutch
Foreign Minister Jozias van Aartsen. ``We have to be careful.
Russia is still selling grain on world markets.''
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said ``generalized food
shortages'' may come only after the New Year, but said the EU
should plan now since it would take two months for the first
shipments to reach Russia.
	   The Eu was expected to finalized the package in the weeks ahead
to give the EU leaders the opportunity to make a formal
announcement when they meet Dec. 11-12 in Vienna, Austria.
	   The EU stock of surplus grain is currently about 10 million
tons. In addition it has some 500,000 tons of beef and 400,000 tons
of rice in surplus stocks.
	   Russia has been hit hard by economic problems coupled with the
worst grain harvest in 40 years. Food prices have risen 50 percent
due to the financial crisis, prompting worries that the poor won't
be able to afford food.
	   Russian officials have said their emergency reserve will last
only two to three weeks.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Kenneth Carlsen of Denmark defeated
Fredrik Jonsson of Sweden 6-4, 7-6 (7-5) in the first round of the
dlrs 825,000 Stockholm Open tennis tournament Monday.
	   Also making it through to the second round, one of the world's
oldest indoors tournaments, is Swede Magnus Gustafsson who beat
Rainer Schuttler of Germany, 3-6, 6-4, 6-4.
	   Later matches for the day included defending champion Jonas
Bjorkman of Sweden aginst German Marc-Kevin Goellner and
third-seeded Briton Tim Henman, who is hoping to qualify for the
ATP World Championships in Hanover, taking on Mikael Tillstrom.
	   The big guns don's see action until Tuesday. American Pete
Sampras, trying to end the season as No. 1 for a record sixth
consecutive year, has accepted a wild card. Greg Rusedski of
Britain, who beat Sampras in the Paris Open final Sunday, also
plays Tuesday.
	   Sampras has never won the tournament. He reached the semifinal
in 1994, when the tournament was held in the 14,000-seat Globe
Arena. In 1995, the tournament returned across town to its original
site, the Royal Tennis Hall.

Heavy fighting resumes around southern port of Kismayo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ Heavy fighting between Majerten and
Marehan clan militiamen has resumed in the southern port town of
Kismayo after four days of relative calm, reports said Monday.
	   Ibrahim Jama Egal Howle, spokesman for Marehan fighters who are
backed by South Mogadishu warlord Hussein Mohamed Aidid, said his
men had pushed the Majerten fighters loyal to Gen. Mohamed Said
Hirsi, better known as Morgan, back towards Kismayo, causing him
heavy losses.
	   There were no precise figures available on casualties, but field
radios from both sides put the number of militiamen killed on both
sides at 10 and said many more civilians had been killed and
wounded.
	   In April and May, Morgan attempted to push out of Kismayo to
regain control of the fertile Juba Valley from the rival Somali
National Front, after SNF militia attempted to dislodge the
Majerten from the port in March.
	   Aidid's late father, Gen. Mohamed Farah Aidid, took Kismayo at
the beginning of 1992, a year after he and warlord Ali Mahdi
Mohamed ousted dictator Mohamed Siad Barre, who was Morgan's
father-in-law.
	   Morgan's Somali Patriotic Movement retook the major port 400
kilometers (248 miles) southwest of Mogadishu in 1993 but has been
unable to gain control of the hinterland.
	   The Somali National Front on Monday warned local and
international aid organizations operating in Kismayo not to attempt
to use the town's airport or seaport and declared the whole area a
war zone.
	   There was no official reaction from Morgan on the resumption of
fighting.
	   Somalia has been without a central government since Siad Barre's
ouster after which rival clan-based militia turned the country into
armed fiefdoms.

U.N. envoy sounds out African countries on Angola peace process
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ A U.N. envoy embarked Monday on a tour of
African countries to consult with regional leaders on rescuing
Angola's ailing peace process.
	   Issa Diallo's seven-day trip was to include stopovers in South
Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso and Gabon.
	   Diallo, the U.N. envoy to Angola, said he would ask officials in
those countries to persuade the Angolan government and former rebel
group UNITA to continue with the implementation of Angola's 1994
peace deal.
	   Diallo said he would visit more southern African countries next
week, though he declined to say which ones.
	   He said he would then report to United Nations Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on the progress of the peace deal which ended a
two-decade civil war between the government and UNITA.
	   The deal has looked likely to unravel in recent months amid
deepening hostility between the former foes.
	   The former rebels still have not complied with some of the peace
demands, and the international community's patience is running
thin. The U.N. peacekeeping force has been scaled down to a few
hundred staff.
	   Annan is to present a report to the Security Council by Nov. 23
so that it can decide on its future role in Angola.

Report: Turkish troops encircle Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish troops have encircled up to 500
Turkish Kurd rebels in northern Iraq to block them from escaping
into Iraqi-controlled territory, Turkey's semiofficial Anatolia
news agency reported Monday.
	   Allegations that Saddam Hussein is supporting Turkey's rebel
Kurdistan Worker's Party have been on the increase in recent
months. The group, known by its Turkish initials PKK, has been
fighting for Kurdish autonomy in southeast Turkey for more than a
decade.
	   The PKK has reportedly lost much of its support recently, since
Turkey pressured Syria to stop its alleged aid to the rebels and
the Iraqi Kurdish factions controlling northern Iraq pledged to
fight the PKK.
	   The PKK denies having the backing of Iraq, according to a
Kurdish group linked to the rebels. But Turkish newspapers have
claimed that the group opened two training camps in Iraq and an
office in Baghdad.
	   Turkey confirmed Sunday that it had launched an offensive in
northern Iraq to eradicate about 500 rebels who had left Syria and
entered northern Iraq. The military refused to give any details.
	   Baghdad lost control over the region after the 1991 Gulf War,
when the United States and its allies set up a de facto autonomous
Kurdish zone.
	   Mizgin Sen, spokeswoman for a Kurdish organization that includes
PKK members, said she believed Turkey's cross-border offensive was
timed to talks between two Iraqi Kurdish leaders this weekend in
the Turkish capital of Ankara.
	   Massoud Barzani of the Kurdistan Democratic Party and Jalal
Talabani of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan signed a peace accord
in Washington in September agreeing to share power and hold
elections next year.
	   The agreement angered Turkey, which opposes any move towards the
creation of an independent Kurdish state that could inspire
Turkey's Kurds in their battle for autonomy.
	   ``It seems like a message was being sent to the leaders, saying:
`You can't do things without Turkey,''' Sen said by telephone from
Brussels.

	   MALISEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A visiting U.S. war crimes envoy saw
first-hand evidence Monday of the ongoing violence in Kosovo _ the
bodies of two Serb policemen who were apparently executed.
	   David Scheffer, the roving U.S. ambassador on war crimes, viewed
the bodies in this devastated central village as he toured Kosovo
with the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission (KDOM).
	   The policemen _ Ilija Vujosevic and Dejan Djatlov _ disappeared
Friday, the same day that Serb police shot to death five ethnic
Albanian guerrillas, including a commander of two divisions.
	   Violence by both sides has increased in the past week in the
secessionist province, including at least three incidents in which
police reported killing Kosovo Liberation Army fighters who shot at
them first. No police were killed or injured in any of those
incidents.
	   Dozens of Serb police are believed to have been killed since
Serbs began cracking down on ethnic Albanian separatists last
February in Kosovo. Several hundred other people have been killed,
and as many as 300,000 have been driven from their homes in the
majority ethnic Albanian province.
	   Scheffer and KDOM observers went to Malisevo to investigate the
report of the missing policemen as well as a gunbattle Sunday
night. Serb and Albanian accounts of who initiated that clash
differed, but neither side reported injuries.
	   Both of the slain policemen had gunshot wounds to the head,
indicating they had been killed execution-style.
	   It was unclear if their deaths were intended as retribution for
the killing of the five KLA members. Rebels say police ambushed the
five as they drove in two vehicles from Opterusa village, while
police claim the guerrillas opened fire first on a police patrol.
	   Qamil Hajrizi, the father of one of the slain guerrillas, said
Monday that his son's body was riddled with bullets.
	   ``From what I saw, they were certainly ambushed,'' he said after
waiting about four hours to collect the body from a hospital morgue
in the southern city of Prizren. ``He was destroyed by many, many
bullets.''
	   Two teams of international observers helped Hajrizi, 50,
overcome intransigence by Serb police, who initially said the
father lacked the necessary paperwork to recover the remains. The
KDOM observers refused to speak to journalists.
	   A KLA figure called the killing of the five guerrillas an ambush
that violated a de facto cease-fire in Kosovo. Under a
four-week-old agreement between Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, Milosevic's forces were
supposed to cease hostilities.
	   The KLA was not a party to the Oct. 12 agreement, but has
declared its own unilateral cease-fire except in the case of
attacks by Serb and Yugoslav forces.

Swiss ask Egypt to state whether Luxor compensation forthcoming
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland has called on Egypt to
clarify whether it will provide compensation in connection with
last year's massacre of tourists in Luxor, a foreign ministry
spokeswoman said Monday.
	   Swiss Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti made the appeal in a letter
addressed to his Egyptian counterpart, Amr Moussa, spokeswoman
Yasmine Chatila said.
	   Some 35 Swiss tourists were killed in the attack by Islamic
militants last November on the Temple of Hatshepsut in Luxor. In
total, 68 people, including four Egyptians and the gunmen, died.
	   Twenty-four people, including 10 Swiss, were injured.
	   Shortly after the attack, Moussa announced Egypt was considering
a ``gesture of reparation.'' But Switzerland has heard nothing of
the results, Chatila said.
	   Switzerland's main travel companies have declined responsibility
for the attack.

All Black Howard selected by Wales
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CARDIFF, Wales (AP) _ All Black Shane Howarth will make his Test
debut for Wales in Saturday's Wembley clash against world champion
South Africa.
	   The 30-year-old full-back, capped four times by New Zealand in
1994, was selected Monday by new Wales coach Graham Henry.
	   Howarth, who plays for English side Sale, is eligible to play
for Wales because his grandfather was born in Cardiff.
	   Howarth joins two other English Premiership players, Craig and
Scott Quinnell, on the Wales team. Another eight players come from
Welsh sides Cardiff and Swansea.
	   Back-row giant Scott Quinnell was selected, even though the
Rugby Football Union could intervene later this week by rejecting
his appeal against a 14-day suspension. Quinnell was sent off for a
late tackle on England captain Lawrence Dallaglio during Richmond's
victory over Wasps last month.
	   If Quinnell is ruled out, Henry could turn to blindside flanker
Colin Charvis.
	   Swansea's Chris Anthony, who has started just two matches since
suffering a broken leg last April, replaces injured British Lions
tighthead prop David Young.
	   Henry bypassed Britain and St. Helens rugby league wing Anthony
Sullivan.
	   Gareth Thomas and Dafydd James land the wing berths, Mark Taylor
and Scott Gibbs forge an all-Swansea center partnership and Craig
Quinnell and Chris Wyatt form a new second-row combination.

Goldenberg figure charged in alleged forgery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A prominent businessman with close ties to
President Daniel arap Moi's ruling party was arraigned in court
Monday on charges of forgery and conspiracy involving 3.3 billion
Kenya shillings (dlrs 55 million).
	   Kamlesh Pattni, who was out on bail and standing trial in
connection with the alleged bilking of government export subsidies
by his Goldenberg company, was arrested Friday by officers from the
Banking Fraud Investigations Department.
	   Prosecutor Johnson Githitu said Pattni and his attorney Bernard
Kalove forged the signature of businessman Nassir Ehrahim Alif,
chairman of the World Duty-Free shops, and claimed it was genuine
for the purchase and sale of World Duty-Free.
	   Alif alleges Pattni forged letters, signatures and company seals
first acquire and then fraudulently sell the duty-free shops at
Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi and Moi
International Airport in Mombasa.
	   The prosecution alleges the offense occurred March 27, 1992 in
Nairobi.
	   Magistrate Jane Odieki denied both men bail and ordered the
hearing to resume Tuesday.
	   Pattni is currently standing trial on charges of fraudulently
obtaining 5.8 billion Kenya shillings (dlrs 83 million at 1992-93
rates) from the Central Bank of Kenya as compensation for gold,
diamonds and other jewels allegedly exported from Kenya by his
firm, Goldenberg International.
	   Kenya has no no diamonds and little gold.
	   Impatient with the government's failure to prosecute the case,
which has been on the books since late 1993, and its reluctance to
tackle graft in the top echelons of the government, the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank last year stopped
multimillion dollar loans to Kenya.
	   Analysts claim the latest charge against Pattni represent an
attempt by members of the government and the ruling Kenya African
National Union to draw attention away from the Goldenberg trial
which was reaching a crucial point in revelations of high-level
fraud.

German police say body in field may have fallen from aircraft
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WALDSHUT-TIENGEN, Germany (AP) _ A young African whose shattered
body was found in a field in southwest Germany may have fallen from
an aircraft, police said Monday.
	   Police said the approximately 15-year-old boy may have stowed
away in the undercarriage of an aircraft from Africa and fallen out
when the plane opened its landing gear on approach to Zurich
airport in Switzerland.
	   The body was found Sunday in a field near Lauchringen, in the
state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, which borders Switzerland. The town
lies under the approach to Zurich's Kloten airport.
	   The youth, who apparently was blind, appeared to have fallen
from a great height and was likely dead before falling, police
said.
	   Police said an autopsy would be conducted.

Far-right leader unhurt in drive-by can throwing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ An assailant threw a can at the car of far-right
leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, shattering the window but not injuring
the National Front leader or his wife, the party said Monday.
	   Le Pen, who himself was convicted earlier this year of
assaulting a Socialist politician during a rally, was attacked
Friday evening in central Paris when the occupant of another car
recognized him, said party spokesman Alain Vizier.
	   Le Pen's car, which was being driven by his wife, was stopped at
a red light near the Champs-Elysees when the can hit the rear,
passenger-side window, the spokesman said. Le Pen wrote down the
license plate number and immediately filed a complaint with police.
	   The alleged assailant, who later turned himself in, was placed
under investigation Saturday and was to appear before a judge, Le
Parisien newspaper reported.
	   Police would not return calls for comment, and the National
Front wouldn't give details.
	   ``Mr. Le Pen has no comment on the matter,'' Vizier said. ``He
doesn't want this to serve as a bad example to others.''
	   Last month, the European Parliament voted to lift Le Pen's
parliamentary immunity so German prosecutors can investigate
whether he broke laws that make trivializing the Holocaust a crime.
	   Le Pen, whose anti-immigrant National Front has the support of
about 15 percent of the French electorate, called the Holocaust a
``detail in the history of World War II'' at a German news
conference last year. He could face a maximum of five years in jail
if convicted.

Former baseball star Jim `Catfish' Hunter suffers from Lou Gehrig's

disease &QL;

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Hall of Fame pitcher Jim ``Catfish'' Hunter, who
ushered in the era of escalating salaries in North American Major
League Baseball when he signed the sport's first lucrative free
agent deal in the 1970s, has been diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's
disease.
	   Hunter's wife, Helen, said Monday her husband went to Johns
Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore last week after experiencing trouble
with his motor skills. Doctors there confirmed he had the fatal
disease, which attacks nerves in the spinal cord and brain and
causes progressive paralysis.
	   ``He'll start sometime this week taking the only medication for
(the disease),'' his wife said from the family's farm in Hertford,
North Carolina. ``It helps prolong. It slows it down.''
	   Hunter, 52, began noticing weakness in his arms in March and
last week said he had lost strength in both his arms and hands.
	   But he is following some of his usual routines, and was out
Monday hunting with one of his sons, she said.
	   Hunter, baseball's first big-money free agent, signed a dlrs
3.75 million contract with the New York Yankees in 1974. He won 224
games in a 15-year career with the Yankees and the Oakland and
Kansas City Athletics.
	   The illness, also known as amytrophic lateral sclerosis, became
commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease after the Yankees' Hall of
Famer, who died from the condition in 1941 at age 37.
	   An estimated 30,000 Americans have ALS. It usually strikes
between ages 40 and 60. A small proportion of cases are due to
defective genes, but the cause for about 95 percent of cases is not
known.
	   Among its victims have been actors David Niven and Dennis Day,
and composer Dmitri Shostakovich.

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ Government troops chased the last
large group of rebel fighters into the mountains on Monday after
five days of fighting in the Central Asian nation.
	   The 200 rebels concentrated around the town of Aini, about 160
kilometers (100 miles) north of the capital Dushanbe, tried to flee
in small groups toward the border of Uzbekistan after suffering
heavy losses in weekend firefights with government soldiers.
	   ``Practically all the Aini district is now under control of
government troops,'' said Tajikistan Security Minister Saidamir
Zakhurov.
	   Government officials said the rebels could not escape because
the area is surrounded, the border with Uzbekistan has been closed,
and all roads have been cut off.
	   As fighting in Aini subsided, the International Red Cross in
Tajikistan sent a delegation to northern Tajikistan to survey the
damage and distribute medical supplies.
	   Red Cross officials said 40 homes had been completely destroyed
in fighting over the weekend in the city of Khudzhand, and more
than 2,000 homes needed repairs. They also said more than 500
people had been wounded in Khudzhand.
	   The government has said more than 200 people have been killed
since the fighting broke out last Wednesday. A nationwide day of
mourning was declared for Tuesday.
	   Meanwhile, the whereabouts of rebel leader, former army Col.
Makhmud Khudoberdyev, were unknown, said presidential spokesman
Zafar Saidov.
	   There were unconfirmed reports suggesting that Khudoberdyev and
former Prime Minister Abdumalik Abdulladzhanov had already escaped
into Uzbekistan, Saidov said. Uzbekistan's government denied
harboring them or other rebels.
	   The Tajikistan government appealed to Uzbekistan, Russia and
other countries of the former Soviet Union for assistance in
detaining organizers of the revolt.
	   The rebels, meanwhile, issued an appeal Monday to the U.N.
Security Council to help stop the government's ``genocide'' of
opposition Tajiks.
	   Deputy Security Minister Khudoikul Khamrakulov said on national
television Monday that several of the rebels had been training in
recent weeks at a base in neighboring Afghanistan to prepare for
the attack.
	   Khudoberdyev launched the uprising with demands that President
Emomali Rakhmonov free all political prisoners and bring his
supporters into the government. The president refused to negotiate
with the rebels.
	   The fighting follows a peace treaty last year that ended five
years of civil war between the Muslim opposition and Rakhmonov's
hard-line government. Main opposition groups are now participating
in the government and the armed forces.
	   Still, there are many rebel leaders and warlords who ignore the
accords and wage small-scale attacks across the poor, mountainous
former Soviet republic.
	   Rakhmonov released a statement denouncing the rebels, and saying
their uprising had not derailed Tajikistan's attempts to adhere to
the peace treaty, the ITAR-Tass news agency said Monday.
	   ``The peace process in the republic is continuing and there are
no forces able to stop it,'' he said.

Kucera qualifies for season-ending event

<TEXT>
	   MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) _ Slovakia's Karol Kucera is the latest
player to qualify for the season-ending ATP World Championship in
Hannover, Germany, the ATP said Monday.
	   Kucera, who clinched a spot in the tournament for the first time
in his career, won tour titles this year in Sydney and New Haven
and was a semifinalist in Vienna three weeks ago.
	   His second-round win over Fabrice Santoro in last week's Paris
Open and the injury withdrawals of Patrick Rafter and Richard
Krajicek guaranteed Kucera's spot in the eight-man Hannover field.
	   The final two places in the dlrs 3.5 million event, which runs
from Nov. 24-29, will be decided this week at ATP Tour events in
Stockholm and Moscow.
	   Three players are in the running: the British duo of Tim Henman
and Greg Rusedski and Russia's Yevgeny Kafelnikov.
	   Rusedski, who beat No. 1 Pete Sampras in the Paris Open final
Sunday, and Henman are playing in Stockholm. Kafelnikov needs to
reach the final in Moscow to keep his hopes alive.
	   Those already qualified are Sampras, Marcelo Rios, Andre Agassi,
Carlos Moya, Alex Corretja and Kucera.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Islamic scholars Monday defended their religion's
human-rights record before a special United Nations forum aimed at
improving respect for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
	   ``There are still some circles in the West, acting out of their
own vested interests, who still persist on perpetuating fears and
arousing suspicion about Islam,'' said Kamel Al-Sharif of Jordan,
secretary-general of an Islamic relief organization.
	   Critics of the religion have been organizing anti-Islamic
campaigns which portrayed a false image of the religion, said
al-Sharif, of the International Islamic Council for Daw'a
(religious calling) and Relief. .
	   ``It is not strange for the Arabs and Muslims to support the
International Declaration of Human Rights because they can find in
it a collection of supreme humanitarian principles which are
compatible with their faith and traditions,'' he said.
	   Al-Sharif was one of 20 authorities on Islamic law invited to
speak at the two-day event, organized by Mary Robinson, U.N. high
commissioner for human rights, at the suggestion of Iran.
	   In her keynote speech, Mrs. Robinson said Islam, which is the
religion of a fifth of the people on the planet, had ``the dignity
of the human person, tolerance and equity at the core of its
message.''
	   Apart from Mrs. Robinson, all the speakers were Muslims.
Human-rights organizations have complained that they are barred
from asking questions or commenting at the seminar.
	   Ahmad Kamal Abdoumagd, professor of public law at the University
of Cairo, told the seminar that no country entirely lived up to
what was stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, now
in its 50th anniversary year.
	   ``This is nothing particular to Islam. It is everywhere,'' said
Abdoumagd.
	   ``Else how can we understand that in a highly developed country
like the United States racial discrimination and other forms of
discrimination continue to survive?''
	   Abdoumagd also attacked Muslims and non-Muslims who called for
the rejection of the Islamic Shariah legal code as the only way to
ensure human rights, saying the suggestion lacked ``cultural
legitimacy.''
	   ``No Muslim would accept a solution that doesn't stem internally
from his culture,' he said.
	   The idea for the seminar was born when Mrs. Robinson visited
Iran in February. The Iranians suggested a scholarly event to try
to bring together Islamic culture and the rights declaration.
	   Human rights organizations have accused Iran and some other
countries in the Muslim world of systematic abuses that include
extrajudicial killings, torture and harsh prison conditions.
	   The event has been put together in conjunction with the
Organization of the Islamic Conference, which has 52 member
countries.
	   ``We are hoping it will be the start of a process,'' John Pace,
spokesman for the U.N. commissioner, said before the start of the
seminar.
	   ``The purpose is to remove or help to remove certain levels of
ignorance of values and customs.''

New gold reserve announced in northern Greece
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A gold deposit in northeast Greece is
estimated to have a total production capacity of 1.25 million troy
ounces _ worth about dlrs 365 million at current prices _ a mining
company said Monday.
	   The Silver &AMP; Baryte Ores Mining Co. said a feasibility study is
expected to be completed in 1999 at the site, about 220 kilometers
(135 miles) east of Salonica.
	   Preliminary tests indicated that gold recovery of about 90
percent is possible, the company said.
	   The gold mining potential is vast in northern Greece, where
precious metals have been mined since the ancient Greeks.
	   A Toronto-based company, TVX Gold Inc., is seeking to set up a
gold processing site about 65 kilometers (40 miles) east of
Salonica. TVX estimates the gold reserves at 3.4 million troy
ounces, or about dlrs 992 million.
	   But environmental protests and legal troubles have slowed the
project.

	   PARIS (AP) _ An assailant threw a beer bottle at the car of
far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, shattering the window but not
injuring the National Front leader or his wife, the party said
Monday.
	   Le Pen, who himself was convicted earlier this year of
assaulting a Socialist politician during a rally, was attacked
Friday evening in central Paris when the occupant of another car
recognized him, said party spokesman Alain Vizier.
	   Le Pen's car, which was being driven by his wife, was stopped at
a red light near the Champs-Elysees when the bottle hit the rear,
passenger-side window, the spokesman said. Le Pen wrote down the
license plate number and immediately filed a complaint with police.

Irish politician says Iraq flexible on weapons crisis

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ An Irish politician who helped lay the
groundwork for the recent Northern Ireland peace accord said Monday
that Iraq is ``very flexible'' in seeking a solution over weapons
inspections and urged dialogue and not military action.
	   Former Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds, who was credited
with encouraging the Irish Republican Army's 1994 cease-fire, said
he believed Iraq had met 80 percent of U.N. demands on eliminating
its weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``That remaining 20 percent, in my view, does not justify a
strike or a return to conflict,'' Reynolds said, speaking at the
end of a three-day visit.
	   He told reporters that he found Iraq's deputy prime minister,
Tariq Aziz, ``open'' and ``very flexible'' in seeking a solution.
	   Iraq late last month halted cooperation with U.N. weapons
inspectors, saying they would not be allowed to work until the U.N.
Security Council moves to lift punishing sanctions imposed after
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The United States and Britain have threatened a military strike
to force Iraq to reverse the decision.
	   British Defense Secretary George Robertson warned during a visit
to Kuwait on Monday that the patience of the international
community was ``draining away'' and that ``the option of force is
there, is real.''
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton met Sunday with his top security
advisers but put off a decision on whether to use force against
Iraq.
	   Reynolds said that he would travel to the United States on
Thursday to discuss the issue with U.S. politicians. Tam Dalyell, a
British parliament member from Scotland who accompanied Reynolds,
said he would speak with British leaders.
	   ``Today I would like to send a very clear message and a clear
call to the United Nations, to President Clinton and to (British)
Prime Minister Tony Blair that whatever (their feelings) about the
conflict, that everybody gets around the table to ... debate and
talk to remove the sanctions,'' Reynolds said.
	   He added: ``We believe that with good will on both sides, that a
compromise could be worked out.''
	   The visit by the Irish and British politicians was an echo of
the last crisis with Iraq in February when politicians from Russia,
Turkey and several Arab states showed up in Baghdad to try to press
for a diplomatic solution.
	   During that confrontation _ over Iraq's refusal to allow arms
inspectors into presidential palaces _ Washington and London also
threatened to use force. But Secretary-General Kofi Annan defused
the crisis by pledging to work toward lifting the sanctions.
	   Also on Monday, Hans von Sponeck, a German national, arrived in
Baghdad to take over as head of U.N. humanitarian operations in
Iraq. He replaces Irishman Denis Halliday, who left in September
after bitterly criticizing the sanctions for devastating the Iraqi
economy.
	   The humanitarian office oversees the U.N. oil-for-food program,
an exemption from the sanctions that allows Iraq to sell limited
quantities of oil to buy needed food and medicine for its 22
million people.
	   Meanwhile, five more inspectors from the U.N. Special Commission
_ which is responsible for elimination of Iraq's chemical and
biological weapons as well as long-range missiles _ left the
country.
	   Iraq must cooperate with the weapons inspectors for the
sanctions to be lifted. Iraq says it has met the U.N. conditions,
but the arms monitors repeatedly have accused Iraq of withholding
information and misleading weapons teams.
	   UNSCOM began reducing its staff on Saturday, saying it was
useless to leave inspectors in Baghdad when they couldn't work. Ten
more are to depart Wednesday, bringing the total to 30, said
Caroline Cross, UNSCOM spokeswoman in Baghdad.
	   She noted that more than 100 U.N. weapons staffers remain in the
country and could resume inspections immediately if Iraq changes it
position.

U.S. envoy sees bodies of two slain Serb policemen

<TEXT>
	   MALISEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A visiting U.S. war crimes envoy saw
first-hand evidence Monday of the ongoing violence in Kosovo _ the
apparently executed bodies of two Serb policemen.
	   Angry Serb police threatened to beef up their patrols in
response to the killings.
	   David Scheffer, the roving U.S. ambassador on war crimes issues,
viewed the bodies in this devastated central village as he toured
Kosovo with the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission (KDOM).
	   The policemen _ Ilija Vujosevic and Dejan Djatlov _ disappeared
Friday, the same day Serb police shot to death five ethnic Albanian
guerrillas, including a commander of two divisions.
	   Both of the slain policemen had gunshot wounds to the head,
indicating they had been killed execution-style. The bodies were
found earlier Monday by U.S. observers, who informed the police,
Serb media said.
	   Serb police spokesman Bozidar Filic said the executions showed
the Kosovo Liberation Army's utter disregard for the U.S.-sponsored
cease-fire.
	   He warned that unless ``international representatives'' secure
two main roads running through Malisevo by Wednesday, police will
increase their patrols and ``allow safe passage'' _ indicating a
possible new Serb action.
	   Serb authorities suspect the killed policemen were kidnapped by
the KLA in retaliation for the shootings of the five guerrillas.
	   The rebels say police shot at the five as they drove in two
vehicles from Opterusa village, while police claim the guerrillas
opened fire first.
	   Qamil Hajrizi, the father of one of the slain guerrillas, said
Monday that his son's body was riddled with bullets.
	   ``From what I saw, they were certainly ambushed,'' he said after
waiting about four hours to collect the body from a hospital morgue
in the southern city of Prizren. ``He was destroyed by many, many
bullets.''
	   Two teams of international observers helped Hajrizi, 50,
overcome intransigence by Serb police, who initially said the
father lacked the necessary paperwork to recover the remains. The
KDOM observers refused to speak to journalists.
	   A KLA figure called the killing of the five guerrillas an ambush
that violated a de facto cease-fire in Kosovo. Under a
four-week-old agreement between Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, Milosevic's forces were
supposed to cease hostilities.
	   Violence by both sides has increased in the past week, including
at least three incidents in which police reported killing KLA
fighters who shot at them first.

Former victims of Pinochet's rule now in front line of his defense
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By EDUARDO GALLARDO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Several Chilean officials who suffered
exile, arrest and even torture under the long reign of Augusto
Pinochet are now in the front line of efforts to free the former
dictator from arrest in London and bring him home.
	   Leading the campaign is Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza,
who spent 14 years in exile, saw close friends killed under
military rule and was given just a few days to return to see his
dying father.
	   Insulza is not alone among Chileans who strongly opposed
Pinochet and suffered for it. Now they are working for their
government on behalf of the 82-year-old general.
	   Traveling in Europe in the 1980s, Senate President Andres
Zaldivar granted an interview to an Italian newspaper. Pinochet's
government didn't like what he said and barred Zaldivar from
returning for nearly four years.
	   Still, Zaldivar has been openly urging Pinochet's release,
saying, ``I firmly opposed him, but one has to act (on behalf of )
a person who has responsibilities of state, even when it is
difficult to do so.''
	   It is not easy for Insulza, either.
	   ``Do not think this makes me happy,'' he told foreign
correspondents recently. ``But I do believe in what I am doing.''
	   The government, he explained ``is not defending a specific
person. It is defending principles, because Pinochet is a member of
the Chilean senate, and as such, has immunity.''
	   British police arrested Pinochet on Oct. 16 at the request of a
Spanish magistrate seeking him for trial. The Spanish warrant
accuses Pinochet of presiding over human rights abuses committed by
his secret police after he seized power in 1973.
	   The government has said some 3,000 people died or disappeared
during Pinochet's 17-year rule.
	   Pinochet was sworn in as a senator-for-life in March, a post
created for himself in the constitution drafted by his 1973-90
regime.
	   Insulza and others avoid discussing their personal feelings at
having to aid the man they opposed for so many years, insisting
that they are merely fulfilling a legal and political obligation.
	   The chief government spokesman, Jorge Arrate, admitted, however,
that it has been a sour time. He has often had to go public backing
the government's defense of Pinochet.
	   ``It's the second most difficult situation I have faced in my
life,'' he told the Santiago daily El Mercurio. ``The worse was my
forced exile of 14 years.''
	   Addressing the nation soon after Pinochet's arrest, President
Eduardo Frei admitted that the case is difficult for several aides.
	   But he noted that at a recent cabinet session, a socialist
minister who was arrested, mistreated and exiled under Pinochet had
backed a proposal seeking his release. ``That is how national
reconciliation is built,'' Frei said.
	   The president did not identify the official, but he appeared to
refer to Public Works Minister Jaime Toha.
	   Toha was agriculture minister in the leftist government toppled
by the 1973 coup. Arrested and confined to windswept Dawson island,
Toha later spent more than a decade in exile.
	   Toha has refused to discuss the situation, but did not deny that
he was the official referred to by Frei.
	   Criticized even by members of his own Socialist Party, Insulza
admitted it may seem odd to seek Pinochet's release on humanitarian
grounds, given the poor human rights record of the general's
regime.
	   ``He did what he did, and I do what I do. I am not him,''
Insulza said. ``He has rights. I do not want any one in Chile be
treated in an unjust manner.''
	   Asked by El Mercurio whether he has forgiven Pinochet, he
replied: ``Pardon is something very intimate, but he has the same
rights as any other citizen. He is entitled to justice.''
	   But in meeting with the correspondents, Insulza left little
doubt about the strength of his feelings.
	   Angered by what he saw as an ironic remark by a European
journalist about his protecting Pinochet, Insulza made a rare
reference to his long exile and dramatic visit to see his father
die. Then he walked out of the room.

Jospin `surprised' by controversy over plea for mutineers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ A political battle between the French right
and left over an 80-year-old military mutiny is refusing to die.
	   Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said Monday he was surprised by the
controversy that followed his call last week to rehabilitate a
group of World War I mutineers who revolted during a catastrophic
1917 offensive against the Germans at Chemins des Dames.
	   ``There was no reason for this controversy,'' Jospin said in
Lyon, where he was attending a trade and development conference.
	   ``All of the documents published, the historians' testimony and
the way in which survivors of the Chemin des Dames have spoken show
that what I said was humane, just and necessary.''
	   ``I was surprised by this polemic.''
	   Jospin, in a visit Thursday near the site of the bloody battle,
asked that the 49 mutineers executed ``as an example'' be ``fully
reintegrated today into our national collective memory.''
	   President Jacques Chirac, who is in charge of the armed forces,
called Jospin's remarks ``inopportune.'' Philippe Seguin, president
of Chirac's Rally for the Republic (RPR) party said: ``It's not the
first time that (Lionel Jospin) has tried to rewrite history.''
	   On Monday, former prime minister Edouard Balladur, a
conservative, criticized Jospin for making the comments at the
wrong time.
	   ``The moment was poorly chosen to bring up this topic,''
Balladur told France-Inter radio.
	   Jospin's visit last week to the northern town of Craonne, 70
miles northeast of Paris, came a week before France celebrates the
80th anniversary of the war's end.
	   Thousands of soldiers revolted during the bloody 1917 offensive,
refusing to fight on the front line in the month-long battle that
killed 180,000 French men.
	   France has actively worked to forget the rebellion, even
censoring for years Stanley Kubrick's 1957 movie ``Paths of
Glory,'' which depicted the mutiny.

	   TORONTO (AP) _ Armed men staged a hit-and-run attack on a
Canadian-owned diamond mine in Angola, killing at least five people
and taking four others hostage, the company reported Monday.
	   DiamondWorks Ltd. said the attack occurred early Sunday at its
Yetwene mine in northeastern Angola.
	   ``Preliminary reports indicate that, despite resistance by the
company's security contractors, five of the company's operating
personnel were killed by the assailants,'' the Vancouver-based
company said.
	   ``Four expatriate company personnel are reportedly being held
captive by the attackers and a further two remain unaccounted
for.''
	   It said 18 Angolan workers were wounded in the attack. The
remaining 13 foreign workers were unharmed and were flown to
Angola's capital, Luanda, DiamondWorks said.
	   A company spokesman, Michael Grunberg, said the dead employees
included two Britons, the mine manager and a mining engineer.
	   Also killed was a Portuguese national and two Angolans,
including a representative of the state diamond company, he said.
	   Those taken hostage included a British geologist, two Filipino
mechanics and an Angolan metallurgist who lives in South Africa,
Grunberg said.
	   The identities of the attackers have not been confirmed.
	   Initial reports from the mine indicate that there was some theft
and minor damage to vehicles and communication systems. However,
the company said mining equipment and the diamond processing plant
were not damaged and the diamond inventory was safe.
	   Officials said it was not possible to say when production will
resume. The Yetwene mine has been producing between 5,000 and 6,000
carats a month, about 50 percent the company's total diamond
production.

Egyptian bus plunges into canal, killing eight
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A minibus plunged into a roadside canal at
dawn Monday, killing eight people and critically injuring seven
others.
	   The accident in Kafr Hegazy village, some 80 kilometers (50
miles) north of Cairo, happened when the driver turned sharply
after being blinded by the bright lights of an oncoming car, police
officials said.
	   Villagers, who usually set out at dawn to begin farming in the
Nile Delta, dove into the canal and saved seven people, including
the driver, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Frogmen, who later arrived at the scene, pulled out the bodies
of the other eight.
	   Such accidents are not uncommon in rural Egypt, where roads are
narrow, poorly lit and crowded with trucks, villagers and farm
animals.

Baltics complain of slow response by EU; Nordics say no special
</HEADLINE>
treatment &QL; 
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The prime ministers of Latvia, Lithuania and
Estonia on Monday complained that European Union expansion was
moving so slowly that it could cause instability within the region.
	   The Baltic prime ministers were meeting with their counterparts
from Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Iceland during the 50th
anniversary session of the Nordic Council.
	   All three of the Baltic states are eager to join to European
Union, seeing it as a way to rejoin Western Europe after a
half-century of Soviet rule.
	   Lithuanian Prime Minister Gediminas Vagnorious urged the EU to
speed up membership talks because too long a period of uncertainty
''could provoke unnecessary tensions in the country'' and
complicate relations with Russia and other neighbors.
	   While Nordic EU members Sweden, Denmark and Finland all repeated
their support for their Baltic neighbors joining the EU, they
warned the trio not to expect special treatment when it comes to
fulfilling the tough conditions of membership.
	   ``We cannot reduce the standards,'' said Finnish Prime Minister
Paavo Lipponen said during a news conference by the eight leaders.
``When the real negotiations begin, we need to look truth in the
eyes and discuss the real problems.''
	   Last week, the European Commission said preliminary membership
talks with Cyprus and 10 Eastern European nations were on track,
but that only Estonia among the Baltic states had made enough
progress in economic reforms to be on the fast track to membership.
	   It said Lithuania and Latvia were among the countries that had
much more work to due, but that recent progress by Latvia opened
the hope of it starting serious membership talks next year.
	   At the news conference, Latvian Prime Minister premier Guntars
Krasts said he hoped for a clear message from the EU about when
membership talks will start during its December summit in Vienna.
	   ``We hope for a more structured timetable on when Latvia will be
invited to join the first group in negotiations,'' he said. Krasts
also said he was dissatisfied with the commission criticizing his
country's economic reforms as ``unsustainable.''
	   ``From out point of view, they are sustainable enough because we
base our reforms on policies used by EU counties,'' he said.
	   Estonian's Prime Minister Mart Siimann said his country had
already made great progress, for example cutting its annual
inflation rate to under six percent from nearly 50 percent four
years ago.
	   During the four-day meeting in Oslo, the prime ministers of the
eight contras were to discuss a broad range of topics, in
cooperation in northern Europe, adapting to a European Monetary
Union, protecting the quality of life in the prosperous Nordic
countries.

Norway asks Turkey to allow human activist to travel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Norway on Monday asked Turkey to reverse a
travel ban for leading human rights activist Akin Birdal and allow
him to come to this northern country for medical treatment and
meetings.
	   Birdal, who recently survived an assassination attempt, last
month was sentenced in Turkey to one year in prison for inciting
racial hatred in a speech two years ago. He had called for a
peaceful solution to end a war between autonomy-seeking Kurds and
government troops in southeastern Turkey.
	   It was not clear when Birdal was to begin serving his sentence,
and Norway had invited him to Oslo for physical therapy for the
gunshot wounds he suffered in the assassination attempt. He was
also to have met Norwegian leaders, and hold a lecture at the
Norwegian Nobel Institute, the headquarters of the Nobel Peace
Prize.
	   Norwegian Foreign Ministry spokesman Ingvard Havnen said Birdal
had been denied permission to leave Turkey on Monday.
	   ``We have expressed strong concern and have encouraged the
Turkish authorities to reverse that decision,'' Havnen said by
telephone.
	   Birdal is a prominent campaigner against torture and the army's
forced evacuation of Kurdish villages in southeastern Turkey. He is
head of the country's Human Rights Association.

EU says enlargement drive on target, but 3 nations warn Cyprus
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The EU nations declared their bid to
enlarge the EU on target Monday yet the Netherlands, Germany and
France warned that the inability of Greek and Turkish Cypriots to
reconcile their differences weigh heavily on their island's
membership chances.
	   The EU foreign ministers endorsed a European Commission report
that said efforts to bring Cyprus and 10 East European countries
into the EU in the next decade were progressing satisfactorily.
	   But in a rare joint declaration the Netherlands, Germany and
France warned the division of Cyprus raised the unacceptable
prospect of the EU importing Greek-Turkish rivalry into its ranks.
	   ``It has so far not been possible to find a political solution
for the continued division of Cyprus,'' the three countries said.
	   They said this posed ``fundamental problems'' in the negotiating
process, adding they ``believe a political solution is urgently
required because these problems can only be overcome in that
manner.''
	   On Tuesday, the EU will open membership talks with Cyprus,
Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and Estonia.
	   The EU goal is to admit a unified Cyprus. It always hoped
membership talks with the Greek Cypriot government in Nicosia _ the
only Cypriot government the international community recognizes _
would encourage the island's rival communities to reconcile their
differences.
	   But the two camps have been unable even to put together a joint
negotiating team.
	   Sources said the Netherlands, France and Germany fear once Greek
Cypriots have joined the EU, the pressure will be off them _ and
Greece _ to seek a reunification of Cyprus and may pursue a policy
to keep Turkish Cypriots out of the EU.
	   Turkey invaded the northern one-third of Cyprus in 1974,
installed a government it only recognizes and still maintains
30,000 troops there.
	   The EU has said Turkey is unready for EU membership _ a decision
that has soured relations with Ankara. For its part, Greece has
vetoed EU decisions to provide hundreds of million of dollars in
financing for Turkey.
	   On Monday, the EU foreign ministers delayed a vote on a proposal
to provide Turkey dlrs 180 million for industrial development
projects and enable Ankara to make full use of a 1996 customs union
with the European Union.
	   An Austrian official said ``there were too many apprehensions''
even though the proposal was constructed so that Greece could not
veto the aid as it has done in the past.
	   The foreign ministers delayed a vote and asked the European
Parliament _ the EU assembly _ to debate the issue first.

U.N. envoy sounds out African countries on Angola peace process
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ A U.N. envoy embarked Monday on a tour of
African countries to consult with regional leaders on rescuing
Angola's ailing peace process.
	   Issa Diallo's seven-day trip was to include stopovers in South
Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso and Gabon.
	   Diallo, the U.N. envoy to Angola, said he would ask officials in
those countries to persuade the Angolan government and former rebel
group UNITA to continue with the implementation of Angola's 1994
peace deal.
	   Diallo said he would visit more southern African countries next
week, though he declined to say which ones.
	   He said he would then report to United Nations Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on the progress of the peace deal which ended a
two-decade civil war between the government and UNITA.
	   The deal has looked likely to unravel in recent months amid
deepening hostility between the former foes.
	   The former rebels still have not complied with some of the peace
demands, and the international community's patience is running
thin. The U.N. peacekeeping force has been scaled down to a few
hundred staff.
	   Annan is to present a report to the Security Council by Nov. 23
so that it can decide on its future role in Angola.

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ An existing gold deposit in northeast
Greece is estimated to have a total production capacity of 1.25
million troy ounces _ worth about dlrs 365 million at current
prices _ a mining company said Monday.
	   The Silver &AMP; Baryte Ores Mining Co. said a feasibility study is
expected to be completed in 1999 at the site, about 220 kilometers
(135 miles) east of Salonica.
	   Preliminary tests indicated that gold recovery of about 90
percent is possible, the company said.
	   The gold mining potential is vast in northern Greece, where
precious metals have been mined since the ancient Greeks.
	   A Toronto-based company, TVX Gold Inc., is seeking to set up a
gold processing site about 65 kilometers (40 miles) east of
Salonica. TVX estimates the gold reserves at 3.4 million troy
ounces, or about dlrs 992 million.
	   But environmental protests and legal troubles have slowed the
project.

New Iraq U.N. humanitarian coordinator vows to avoid politics
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos BAG106-107
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The new coordinator for U.N. humanitarian
programs in Iraq arrived Monday and pledged not to politicize his
mandate.
	   Hans von Sponeck, a German, said he planned to work closely with
Iraqi authorities and hopes ``he will never be seen as a manger of
sanctions.''
	   Von Sponeck replaces the outspoken Denis Halliday of Ireland,
who left his post in September after sharply criticizing the U.N.
trade sanctions that have devastated Iraq's economy.
	   A 30-year U.N. veteran, von Sponeck previously worked with the
U.N. Development Program in Geneva, Switzerland. His hometown was
not immediately available.
	   The sanctions were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
They limit the sale of oil and ban most other trade dealings.
	   The humanitarian coordinator oversees the U.N.-approved
oil-for-food program, launched in December 1996. It allows Iraq to
sell limited quantities of oil to buy needed food and medicine for
its 22 million people.
	   Von Sponeck told reporters on arrival at U.N. headquarters on
the outskirts of Baghdad that ``I do not want at this stage at all
to make any kind of statement concerning the relevance or
justification of sanctions.''
	   He arrived amid heightened tension between Iraq and the United
Nations over weapons inspections. Iraq has severed ties with the
U.N. Special Commission, which is responsible for overseeing the
destruction of Iraq's chemical and biological weapons as well as
long-range missiles.
	   Asked about the crisis, von Sponeck said: ``Our mandate has
nothing whatsoever to do with UNSCOM.''
	   He also was asked if there was a contingency plan to evacuate
the nearly 400 U.N. relief workers in Iraq if the impasse over
weapons inspectors prompts the United States or Britain to military
action.
	   ``By the very nature of our work we have to be ready with a
plan,'' he said.
	   Under the current, fourth phase of the oil-for-food program,
Iraq is allowed to export up to dlrs 5.2 billion of oil during a
six-month period. The earlier limit was dlrs 2 billion each six
months.
	   Food purchased under the program is distributed in monthly
rations to all Iraqis. About 150 U.N. food observers travel the
country to ensure that food and medical supplies are equitably
distributed to Iraqis.

Transformer explosion at nuclear plant under investigation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Operators at Bulgaria's controversial
nuclear power plant belatedly reported a transformer explosion, and
police are investigation whether sabotage was involved, the state
news agency BTA said Monday.
	   The incident at the Kozlodui nuclear power plant occurred
Thursday but was reported publicly Monday.
	   After the explosion, the output at one of the 440-megawatt
reactors had to be halved until the transformer was repaired later
Thursday, BTA reported.
	   The special services, a unit of the district police that deals
with serious crimes, has launched an inquiry into the explosion.
They want to determine whether plant employees may have been
involved in sabotage, the agency said.
	   In a statement to BTA, Vice Premier Evgenii Bakardzhiev said the
incident might be ``a sabotage act of a plant worker'' and called
it ``an attempt to create political tensions.''
	   The Kozlodui plant, located 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of
Sofia, has been a continued source of controversy.
	   Its four 440-megawatt pressurized water units were brought
online between 1974 and 1982 and do not have a safety encasements.
	   Two newer 1,000-megawatt units, which have safety encasements,
were installed in 1987 and 1989.
	   The Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency has long
described the four older units as a safety risk.
	   Bulgaria has invested more than dlrs 100 million to upgrade the
reactors' safety systems and repeatedly has balked at calls from
the West to close them down.
	   The plant provides some 40 percent of the country's electricity.

Adams urges Blair to put pressure on Nobel laureate Trimble
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Ireland-Arrests &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Sinn Fein party leader Gerry Adams on Monday
implored British Prime Minister Tony Blair to break the impasse in
Northern Ireland peacemaking by putting pressure on the north's
Protestant leaders, not him.
	   Protestant leader David Trimble is refusing to form a new
administration for Northern Ireland that includes Adams' Irish
Republican Army-allied party unless the IRA starts disarming.
	   April's historic accord _ supported by both Trimble's Ulster
Unionist Party and Sinn Fein _ envisaged forming a new coalition
government by last month, and securing IRA disarmament by mid-2000.
	   ``The refusal to keep to the deadlines in establishing the
(government) institutions is eroding and corroding confidence in
this agreement and its ability to be delivered,'' Adams said
outside 10 Downing St., the prime minister's official London
residence.
	   Trimble, who shared this year's Nobel Peace Prize with Catholic
politician John Hume, insists the IRA needs to show its July 1997
truce is sincere by starting to disarm, or Sinn Fein won't be
eligible to help govern the divided province.
	   But Adams asserted that April's accord doesn't require the IRA
to disarm, and that the truce should be sufficient ``proof of the
goodwill of the IRA.'' He accused Trimble's Ulster Unionists of
``willfully and deliberately'' blocking political progress, and
said Trimble wouldn't budge unless Blair made him.
	   ``If anyone expects unionism to do a decent deal with
nationalism,'' Adams said in reference to those Catholic
politicians seeking Ireland's eventual unification, ``they will
wait for a very, very, very long time indeed.''
	   Blair made no comment after their meeting.
	   Such meetings between Adams and Blair have grown commong,
providing a potent measure of how much the political landscape has
changed within a few years of peacemaking.
	   Adams was barred from traveling to anywhere in Britain until
1994, and wasn't invited to Downing Street _ which the IRA attacked
with mortar shells in 1991 _ until last December, six months after
Blair took power.

Stradivarius reported stolen from Italian violinist's family home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ An Italian concert violionist reported a
Stradivarius that was insured for dlrs 2.9 million stolen from
behind the locked, armored doors of a family home in Rome,
authorities said Monday.
	   Luigi Alberto Bianchi's 1716 violin _ named ``Colussus' for its
bigger-than-the-average-violin size _ was the only item taken in
last week's theft.
	   ``There are no signs of break-in on the door and no one in the
house saw any strange movement,'' said the musician's mother, Ilde
Baravelli Bianchi, according to Italy's AGI news service. ``It's
like it was ... the work of witchcraft that made the violin
disappear.'
	   Luigi Bianchi bought the violin in 1987 at Christie's auction
house for $900,000 and insured it with Lloyd's of London.
	   Italian police said the theft appeared to be specially
commissioned. They alerted police forces worldwide.

Germany suggests debt-relief for disaster-hit Central America
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer is
pushing a plan to forgive some debts owed by Central American
states devastated by Hurricane Mitch in order to free up money for
reconstruction, a spokesman said Monday.
	   But the entire government has yet to sign on to Fischer's
initiative, spokesman Martin Erdmann said.
	   And Germany could not act alone in any case, he said, since
international agreements make the so-called Paris Club of lender
nations responsible for any debt relief.
	   Erdmann said Nicaragua alone, one of the worst-hit nations, owes
Germany 1.2 billion marks (dlrs 730 million) and Honduras about 300
million marks (dlrs 182 million).
	   Germany has already donated 10.2 million marks (dlrs 6.2
million) in disaster relief to areas affected by the catastrophe,
and more was to be announced Tuesday, Erdmann said.

Brazil's human rights activists seeking arrest of Pinochet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Chile's former dictator Augusto
Pinochet would find trouble if the plane that carries him home from
Britain has to land in Brazil, human rights activists warned
Monday.
	   Nilmario Miranda, member of Brazil's Lower House Human Rights
Committee, said it was asking the country's General Attorney to
order the arrest of the former strongman ``as soon as his plane
lands in Brazilian territory.''
	   Miranda said Pinochet should be interrogated about six
Brazilians who lived in the Chilean capital and disappeared shortly
after the 1973 military coup. ``He must tell us about them,'' the
legislator said.
	   The committee was studying ``every possible legal step'' to
allow the arrest of the ex-dictator, even if he does not leave the
plane, which would be considered Chilean territory, he said.
	   The Lords of Appeal, Britain's highest court, is to rule on a
lower court decision that Pinochet was immune to arrest and
prosecution because he was Chile's head of state when the alleged
crimes happened.
	   If the decision is upheld, the plane that would take the
82-year-old retired general back to Chile would have to refuel in
the British island of Ascension and likely in Recife, 3.000
kilometers (1,800 kilometers) northeast of Rio de Janeiro.
	   Human rights and unions in that city said they were planning
public demonstrations against the former dictator.
	   ``Representatives of almost one hundred organizations plan to
approach the plane within a few yards (meters) and show banners
expressing our disgust,'' said on the telephone Amparo Araujo, of
the Tortura Nunca Mais (Torture Never Again) group.

Cornerstone laid on new Dresden synagogue

<TEXT>
	   DRESDEN, Germany (AP) _ Sixty years after Dresden's main
synagogue burned to the ground in the Nazi pogrom Kristallnacht,
officials on Monday laid the cornerstone for a new synagogue on the
same site.
	   The new building will be smaller to reflect the city's
diminished Jewish community, but the leader of Dresden's Jews,
Roman Koenig, expressed hope that it would stand as a sign of
tolerance and vigilance.
	   It is the first new synagogue to be built in the former East
Germany since reunification in 1990.
	   The Semper synagogue, built in 1838 by the same architect who
designed Dresden's famed opera house, was one of more than 1,300
destroyed by Nazi storm troopers on Kristallnacht, known as the
Night of Broken Glass, on Nov. 9, 1938.
	   But Dresden firefighter Alfred Neugebauer, responding to the
blaze, saved a Star of David from the building and hid it in his
attic until the war ended. He then returned it to the Jewish
community.
	   The star will be placed on top of the new synagogue, which will
being holding services in exactly one year.
	   The city of Dresden and Saxony state together have contributed
10 million marks (dlrs 6 million) to build the synagogue. Another 4
million marks (dlrs 2.4 million) has been donated, including
162,631 marks (about dlrs 110,000) collected in Columbus, Ohio,
Dresden's American sister city.
	   A Dresden native, Huntington Bankshares CEO Frank Wobst, helped
forge the sister-city relationship, and returned Monday to present
the check and underline Columbus' commitment to Dresden.
	   ``We wanted to be part of rebuilding the synagogue so Dresden's
Jewish community would have a synagogue and be more complete,''
said Wobst, who was only 4 years old when the old synagogue was
destroyed.
	   He left his native city for West Germany in 1952, as the
communists secured their hold on East Germany, and moved to the
United States several years later.
	   Wobst also brought with him a 50,000 mark (dlrs 30,000) check to
help the rebuilding of the city's central church, the Frauenkirche,
which was destroyed by Allied bombs.

Pinochet not immune from prosecution, ICJ says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Britain-Pinochet &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet is not
immune from prosecution on charges of crimes against humanity, an
influential group of jurists said Monday.
	   The High Court in London ``was profoundly mistaken and
disregarded the very meaning of international law'' when it ruled
Pinochet has diplomatic immunity as a former foreign head of state,
the International Commission of Jurists said in a statement.
	   British police arrested Pinochet, 82, on Oct. 16 in his hospital
bed at the request of a Spanish magistrate seeking to extradite the
former leader for trial.
	   Britain's highest court, the House of Lords, is considering an
appeal against the Oct. 28 High Court ruling.
	   Prosecutors are arguing that the charges of genocide, murder and
torture against the former dictator should overrule any immunity.
	   Immunity on the grounds of Pinochet's function as former head of
state couldn't prevent Pinochet's detention or extradition on such
charges, the ICJ maintained.
	   It rejected Chilean assertions that Pinochet had diplomatic
immunity because he arrived in Britain on a diplomatic passport and
is a Chilean senator. The granting of the passport for personal
travels was an ``abusive'' measure imposed by the military, it
said.
	   The jurists also contended that Pinochet was not the head of
state during the initial period of the 1973 coup which brought him
to power, ``only the leading member of the military junta which had
usurped the government.''
	   The general ``merely assumed office within the framework of a
`new order' illegitimately imposed by the armed forces and by
himself,'' they continued.
	   His protection from prosecution in Chile ``cannot be imposed on
the international community or on other individual states,'' the
ICJ said.
	   The ICJ groups a maximum of 45 prominent jurists from around the
world.

Report: Turkish troops encircle Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Iraqi condemnation of Turkish incursion, Pick up
7th graf pvs

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish troops have surrounded up to 500
Turkish Kurd rebels in northern Iraq to block them from escaping
into Iraqi-controlled territory, Turkey's semiofficial Anatolia
news agency reported Monday.
	   Allegations that Saddam Hussein is supporting Turkey's rebel
Kurdistan Worker's Party have been on the increase in recent
months. The group, known by its Turkish initials PKK, has been
fighting for Kurdish autonomy in southeast Turkey for more than a
decade.
	   The PKK has reportedly lost much of its support recently, since
Turkey pressured Syria to stop its alleged aid to the rebels and
the Iraqi Kurdish factions controlling northern Iraq pledged to
fight the PKK.
	   The PKK denies having the backing of Iraq, according to a
Kurdish group linked to the rebels. But Turkish newspapers have
claimed that the group opened two training camps in Iraq and an
office in Baghdad.
	   Turkey confirmed Sunday that it had launched an offensive in
northern Iraq to eradicate about 500 rebels who had left Syria and
entered northern Iraq. The military refused to give any details.
	   Iraq denounced the latest Turkish incursion Monday and demanded
that Turkey pull out its troops immediately.
	   A Foreign Ministry spokesman, cited by the official Iraqi News
Agency, particularly objected to Turkey sending troops into
northern Iraq at a time when Baghdad was preoccupied by a new
crisis with the United Nations over weapons inspections.
	   ``It is surprising to see the new Turkish invasion coinciding
with the feverish activities and threats by the American
administration and the Zionist entity,'' INA quoted the spokesman
as saying, referring to Israel.

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ As disease and starvation
threatened to raise the death toll from Hurricane Mitch, Central
American leaders met Monday in El Salvador to coordinate strategies
for feeding tens of thousands of survivors and to plan a regional
recovery.
	   The leaders of Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Costa Rica
were expected to appeal to financial organizations to forgive their
foreign debts so they can focus on recovery.
	   ``This meeting is very important because we have to coordinate
action and call on international organizations,'' said Salvadoran
President Armando Calderon Sol as the meeting began at San
Salvador's airport.
	   Also attending were Presidents Carlos Flores Facusse of
Honduras, Arnoldo Aleman of Nicaragua and Miguel Angel Rodriguez of
Costa Rica, as well as Guatemalan Foreign Minister Eduardo Stein
who was standing in for President Alvaro Arzu.

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday issued two
rulings unfavorable to President Bill Clinton in the Monica
Lewinsky investigation.
	   One of the decisions opens the way for Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr to gain new evidence, even as impeachment proceedings
begin in the U.S. House. Starr's investigation is still underway.
	   The court let stand a ruling that said presidential confidant
Bruce Lindsey and other White House lawyers cannot refuse to answer
a federal grand jury's questions about possible criminal conduct by
government officials.
	   The decision puts Lindsey one step closer to revealing
confidential discussions with the president about his sexual
relationship with Lewinsky when she was a White House intern.
	   A key question is what Clinton told Lindsay when Lewinsky's name
arose in the Paul Jones sexual harassment case, where Clinton is
accused of an improper sexual advance when he was governor of
Arkansas. Until Monday, Clinton had been able to protect the
secrecy of the conversations.

Opposition says new draft constitution destroys the nation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ The opposition led by former President
Sali Berisha charged Monday that the new constitution due to be
voted on later this month destroys the Albanian nation by allowing
people to change their nationality and religion.
	   Those two envisaged freedoms likely are the most controversial
issues that recently have sharpened the dispute between the
Socialist-led governing coalition and the opposition.
	   A statement issued by the opposition Democratic Party Monday
said these articles allow ``the legalization of the process of
massive changes in Albanian nationality... a quiet and soft ethnic
cleansing , not through massacres, hunger or diseases but through
visas, baptisms, money and jobs...''
	   It expressed fear that many Albanians might decide to declare
themselves being of a non-Albanian _ mostly of Greek _ nationality
for economic reasons.
	   Most Muslim Albanians working in Greece have changed their names
into Orthodox ones, hoping for better treatement and jobs.
	   During Berisha's rule, municipalities imposed restrictions on
those who were allowed to change their names.
	   Despite the international community's support for the
constitution, the Democrats and their allies have declared they
will boycott the Nov. 22 referendum.
	   ``The Democratic Party calls on Albanians not to not show up for
the referendum ... as it destroys the Albanian nationality,'' said
the statement.
	   They have also boycotted parliament and refused to participate
in the process of drafting of the constitution.
	   European institutions such as the Council of Europe and the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe have criticized
the boycott and have suggested that it leads to the opposition's
self-isolation.

Casiraghi faces surgery on right knee
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Chelsea's Italian striker Pierluigi Casiraghi will
undergo exploratory surgery on his injured right knee Tuesday to
detemine whether he can play again this season.
	   Casiraghi, who joined the London club this season in a
5.4-million-pound (dlrs 9 million) transfer from Lazio, damaged
ligaments in a collision with West Ham defender Rio Ferdinand and
goalkeeper Shaka Hislop during Sunday's 1-1 draw at West Ham.
	   Casiraghi recieved treatment on the pitch for almost five
minutes before being carred off on a stretcher.
	   Initial reports indicated Casiraghi could be out of action for
six months.
	   Casiraghi's injury came three days after fellow Chelsea striker
Brian Laudrup left to join FC Copenhagen.
	   That leaves Chelsea with three top strikers: Italians Gianfranco
Zola and player-manager Gianluca Vialli and Norway's Tor Andre Flo.
	   Vialli moved to replenish his squad by signing Danish midfielder
Bjarne Goldbaek from FC Copenhagen and moving for Finnish under-21
striker Mikkel Forsell.

France publishes catalog to help in search for Nazi-looted works
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ In an effort to recover art works stolen from a
Jewish family during the Holocaust, the French government has
published a catalog of an important collection of Dutch and Flemish
paintings looted by Nazis.
	   The collection of 333 paintings, which originally belonged to a
well-known art connoisseur named Adolphe Schloss, includes works by
Rembrandt and Ruysdael. But at the moment, 171 of the works are
still unaccounted for, the French Foreign Ministry said Monday.
	   ``We have published the collection with two goals in mind: to
help the family's heirs in their search for the works, but also to
warn future buyers from unknowingly receiving stolen goods,'' the
ministry said in a statement.
	   The French government came under scrutiny in late 1996 when a
Paris-based American author, Hector Feliciano, accused state museum
officials of doing little or nothing to trace the owners of 2,000
Nazi-looted works still in the state's collections.
	   Officials insisted that while they might have been forgetful,
they never acted in bad faith. But the controversy came at a
sensitive time for France, which has tried in recent years to make
up for a longtime reluctance to confront its wartime collaboration
with Nazi Germany.
	   According to the Foreign Ministry, Schloss and his wife died
before the war, and the collection was originally willed to their
children, who moved the paintings to a chateau outside of Paris in
1939.
	   On orders from Hitler _ an avid art collector _ German forces
began a search for the paintings soon after they occupied France,
but were unsuccessful until 1943.
	   Meanwhile, the Louvre succeeded in saving 49 of the paintings,
which were returned to the owners in 1945. Most of the collection,
however, was warehoused by the Germans in the Jeu de Paume museum
before being sent to Munich in late 1943.
	   The Foreign Ministry has published 5,000 copies of the catalog,
which will be distributed without charge to museums and art
galleries around the world.

Soccer greats help kick off new FIFA initiative

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Soccer legends Pele, Bobby Charlton,
Franz Beckenbauer and Michel Platini met Monday with FIFA President
Sepp Blatter for discussions on a new panel to address
``fundamental issues facing the game.''
	   The four will be members of the FIFA Football Committee, which
will be chaired by Spanish soccer federation president Angel Maria
Villar.
	   It should be formally set up in December and will also include
current players, referees, coaches, managers and doctors, the world
governing body said in a statement.
	   The new committee should meet four or five times a year. It will
not discuss the laws of soccer but will concentrate on ``the future
welfare of the game in more general terms,'' Blatter said.
	   The visit followed a personal initiative by the Brazilian Pele,
who had requested a meeting with Blatter to discuss future
cooperation, FIFA said.
	   ``It's vital that the professional sector of football uses its
resources and expertise to help the smaller federations,''
Germany's Beckenbauer said.
	   ``The good image of the game itself is the responsibility of all
of us.''

Israeli air attack after guerrilla ambush in South Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes fired at least one
missile Monday at suspected guerrilla bases in southern Lebanon,
Lebanese security officials said.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the afternoon
raid on a valley between the Shiite Muslim villages of Yater and
Jebal al-Boutom.
	   The area, 15 kilometers (10 miles) south of the port city of
Tyre, is often used by Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas to
launch attacks on Israeli troops occupying a border enclave in
South Lebanon.
	   In Israel, the military confirmed the raid, saying the jets
struck ``terrorist positions'' in southern Lebanon.
	   The air attack came after Hezbollah guerrillas ambushed an
Israeli outpost at Blatt, three kilometers (two miles) north of the
Israeli border, the Lebanese officials said. They spoke on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   A Hezbollah statement said the mortar attack caused ``definite
casualties.'' There was no immediate word from Israel on the
guerrilla attack.
	   On Sunday, Israeli helicopters and artillery fired on suspected
guerrilla hideouts after Lebanese guerrillas attacked
Israeli-backed militiamen in the south.
	   Hezbollah leads a guerrilla war to oust some 1,500 Israeli
soldiers and 2,500 allied Lebanese militiamen from the enclave,
which Israel established in 1985 to guard against cross-border
guerrilla attacks.

French actor Jean Marais dead at 84
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to some points &QL; 
 &UR; By MARILYN AUGUST &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Jean Marais, the French actor who began his career
in art films as the protege of surrealist artist Jean Cocteau and
became a pillar of the French cinema, has died at 84, city
officials said Monday.
	   Marais had been in declining health for the past year and was
hospitalized in June with malnutrition. He died Sunday at the
Broussailles hospital in Cannes, southern France, according to city
officials in the nearby town of Valluris.
	   A would-be actor twice rejected from France's top drama schools,
Marais went on to become one of the nation's most beloved movie
stars _ thanks to Cocteau.
	   The two met in 1937. At the time, Marais was struggling to eke
out a living, while Cocteau was a dominant force on the French
cultural scene.
	   Marais' good looks and strong personality appealed to Cocteau,
who would later tell him, ``There's a catastrophe. I've fallen in
love with you.''
	   The two became inseparable, and were one of France's most
prominent couples in the arts until Cocteau's death in 1963. The
relationship fired Cocteau's imagination, inspiring many plays,
films, poems and drawings.
	   Strikingly handsome, with thick blond hair which turned to pure
white as he aged, Marais was best known for his role as the hairy
beast in Rene Clement's 1945 classic,``The Beauty and the Beast.''
	   His early roles included ``Les Parents Terribles,'' first on the
stage later and on screen, ``Orphee'' in 1949, and ``Le Testament
d'Orphee'' in 1960.
	   He also starred in ``The Hunchback'' and was a swashbuckling
hero in films such as ``Le Capitan,'' ``Le Capitain Fracasse'' and
the ``Fantomas'' series with Louis de Funes.
	   Marais worked with top directors such as Jean Renoir, Luchino
Visconti and Abel Gance.
	   In the mid-1990s, he starred at the famed Paris cabaret Les
Folies Bergeres, and played Prospero in Shakespeare's ``the
Tempest.''
	   He published several books about his life, and had a show of his
art work in 1995.
	   ``Life is unfair,'' he told the Journal du Dimanche newspaper in
1996. ``I got nothing but the best.''
	   Marais was born on Dec. 11, 1913 in Cherbourg. Soon after, his
mother left his father and settled in a Parisian suburb with Jean
and his brother, Henri.
	   Jean was fascinated by the theater at a young age, and would
tell his friends his mother was an actress at the Comedie
Francaise.
	   He wasn't much of a student, going from school to school and
finally dropping out at the age of 16.
	   Several attempts to get into acting school failed, and he earned
a living as an apprentice photographer before meeting Cocteau.
	   Marais had one adopted son, Serge.

Pinochet lawyers say free him and let Chilean court decide on
</HEADLINE>
trial &QL;

ex-minister &QL; 
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC;

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Gen. Augusto Pinochet should be freed to return to
Chile whose courts could then decide whether he has immunity from
allegations of genocide, murder and torture during his 17-year
rule, his lawyers urged in Britain's highest court Monday.
	   Outside the House of Lords where five judges are hearing a bid
to uphold Pinochet's arrest on a Spanish extradition warrant,
Chilean opponents reacted angrily to a statement by the former
dictator defending his 1973 overthrow of a Marxist President
Salvador Allende and saying, ``I am at peace with myself, and with
the Chilean people.''
	   ``The ex-dictator ... (has made) not even the most minor gesture
of repentance for the brutal acts he committed during his
government,'' the son of Orlando Letelier, Allende's foreign
minister killed in a 1976 car-bombing in Washington, told
reporters.
	   ``He simply ignores them,'' added Juan Pablo Letelier, a
congressman who is among prominent Chileans _ both opponents and
supporters of Pinochet _ who have come to London to lobby.
	   In court, Clare Montgomery, one of several top lawyers appearing
for Pinochet, also argued that if the British judges upheld the
arrest of the 82-year-old general it would imperil Chile's fragile
democracy.
	   She noted there are 11 proceedings against Pinochet in Chile,
adding, ``it will be for the court there to decide whether he is to
be accorded immunity.''
	   So far, Pinochet has enjoyed immunity in his native land as a
senator for life since he stepped down in 1990, and under laws he
instigated while in office.
	   The London hearing, in its third day, was adjourned until
Tuesday afternoon and may now last through Wednesday. It is not
know when the judges will announce a decision.
	   Pinochet, arrested Oct. 16 while recuperating from back surgery,
remains in a London hospital under police guard. A Chilean jet is
waiting at an air base outside London to fly him home if the House
of Lords frees him.
	   Britain's High Court quashed the arrest Oct. 28 on grounds he
has immunity from prosecution in Britain a former foreign head of
state.
	   Lawyers for Spanish and British prosecutors, appealing against
the ruling, have argued that genocide and torture are crimes so
grave that they supersede Britain's 1978 State Immunity Act. A
Chilean government report says some 3,000 people were killed or
disappeared at the hands of secret police during Pinochet's rule.
	   Earlier, Ms. Montgomery said Pinochet had been a regular visitor
to Britain since he left office in 1990, including at the
invitation of the Royal Ordnance, a British arms supplier once
owned by the government but now in private hands.
	   The Foreign Office says Pinochet does not have diplomatic
immunity from arrest _ granted only to members of foreign
governments on official visits and diplomats. It has acknowledged,
however, that when Pinochet arrived in September on his latest
visit he was given use of a VIP lounge at London's Heathrow
Airport.

FIFA: postponement could bring France back into Confederations Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Postponement of soccer's
Confederations Cup, scheduled for January, is being considered and
could persuade world champion France to take part, a FIFA spokesman
said Monday.
	   France last month pulled out of the event after many European
clubs and domestic leagues made it clear they didn't want to
release their French players for the event, which comes in the
middle of league seasons.
	   ``There is a consensus among the participants that postponement
would be possible'' and that consequently ``French participation
would be possible,'' FIFA spokesman Andreas Herren said.
	   A final decision on dates for the tournament will be made Nov.
17, Herren said. If the tournament is postponed, it will likely
take place in late July or early August, he added.
	   Some regard the event as an unneeded one that exhausts already
burned out players.
	   ``Les Bleus'' were scheduled to represent Europe in the
competition, along with teams from Brazil, Mexico, Bolivia, the
United States, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Australia.
	   Roger Lemerre, the new coach of the French team, had been in
favor of the French team's participation, which would have allowed
him to test out new players.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Kenneth Carlsen of Denmark defeated
Fredrik Jonsson of Sweden 6-4, 7-6 (7-5) in the first round of the
dlrs 825,000 Stockholm Open tennis tournament Monday.
	   Also making it through to the second round, one of the world's
oldest indoors tournaments, is Swede Magnus Gustafsson who beat
Rainer Schuttler of Germany, 3-6, 6-4, 6-4.
	   Later matches for the day included defending champion Jonas
Bjorkman of Sweden aginst German Marc-Kevin Goellner and
third-seeded Briton Tim Henman, who is hoping to qualify for the
ATP World Championships in Hanover, taking on Mikael Tillstrom.
	   The big guns don't see action until Tuesday. American Pete
Sampras, trying to end the season as No. 1 for a record sixth
consecutive year, has accepted a wild card. Greg Rusedski of
Britain, who beat Sampras in the Paris Open final Sunday, also
plays Tuesday.
	   Sampras has never won the tournament. He reached the semifinal
in 1994, when the tournament was held in the 14,000-seat Globe
Arena. In 1995, the tournament returned across town to its original
site, the Royal Tennis Hall.

	   BERLIN (AP) _ With a ``march of silence'' and plans for new
synagogues, Germany's Jewish community marked the 60th anniversary
Monday of Kristallnacht _ the ``Night of Broken Glass'' _ when Nazi
storm troopers burned and ransacked Jewish businesses and temples.
	   Germany's Jewish community is at least 70,000 strong and growing
with Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Neo-Nazi
incidents also are on the rise, and Jewish leaders are more
determined than ever that the Holocaust be remembered, fighting
what they see as a trend toward emphasizing Germany's future at the
expense of remembering its past.
	   Politicians, including Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, religious
leaders and members of the Jewish community gathered for
anniversary speeches in a cavernous, mosaic-covered Berlin
synagogue where windows were shattered during the Kristallnacht
violence.
	   Topic No. 1: How to remember the past while moving Germany into
the 21st century and its seat of government back to Berlin, Adolf
Hitler's capital. Underscoring all the speeches was the theme that
Germans still struggle for the right way to preserve the horrors of
the Holocaust as a lesson for future generations.
	   Ignatz Bubis, the leader of Germany's Jews, lambasted what he
calls an ``intellectual nationalism'' represented in comments from
a German author who says that repeated media references to Nazi
atrocities are designed to perpetuate German guilt.
	   Prize-winning novelist Martin Walser, whose work confronts how
Germans deal with the Nazi past, said he has learned to turn away
from scenes of the Holocaust when he comes across them.
	   To Bubis, Walser's comments give neo-Nazis mainstream arguments
for anti-Semitic assaults, such as the tiny swastikas found Monday
etched into a metal monument commemorating the mass deportation of
Berlin's Jews to concentration camps.
	   ``Whenever someone who is counted among the spiritual elite of
the nation makes such statements, they carry a weight of their
own,'' Bubis told the audience of 2,000. ``... It is certain that
right-wing extremists will refer to Walser.''
	   The Kristallnacht anniversary has particular significance this
year, which saw the election of politicians too young to have
memories of World War II. Led by the 54-year-old Schroeder, the new
government emphasizes a forward-looking Germany, sparking concerns
that the government's move _ coupled with the generational change
in leadership _ reflects a desire to return to a ``normal'' Germany
unburdened by guilt for the Holocaust.
	   ``For me, normality is to be a Jew and to be able to live in
Germany again,'' Bubis said. ``... `Normality' cannot mean that we
supplant memory and live with a new anti-Semitism and new racism.''
	   Guarding against any tendency to forget, Berlin's Jewish
community held its first ``march of silence'' in remembrance of
Kristallnacht. Between 2,000 and 3,000 people formed a sea of
umbrellas on a dark, drizzling afternoon. A march also was held in
Duesseldorf, and ceremonies in Buchenwald, Frankfurt, Hamburg and
Munich.
	   The synagogue ceremony started with a description of
Kristallnacht from historian Andreas Nachama, the leader of
Berlin's Jewish community.
	   On the night of Nov. 9, 1938, Nazi leaders heard a Jew had shot
a German diplomat in Paris. In reprisal, they ordered storm
troopers into the streets in Germany and Austria, which Hitler had
annexed in eight months earlier.
	   They rounded up Jews and burned and broke windows in synagogues
and Jewish businesses _ calling it the ``Night of Broken Glass.''
When the rampage ended on Nov. 10, more than 1,300 synagogues were
destroyed and more than 30,000 Jews had been sent to concentration
camps. Several hundred people were killed or committed suicide.
	   Today, some say Kristallnacht risks being eclipsed by another
watershed in German history _ the Nov. 9, 1989 fall of the Berlin
Wall, which led to German reunification the next year and set the
stage for the capital's return to Berlin.
	   Nachama called it a ``coincidence'' that the two events fall on
the same date but saw commonality in both resulting from
totalitarianism, Kristallnacht from the Nazis and the Berlin Wall
from the communists.
	   Despite cautionary words about the resurgence of neo-Nazism,
there was hope, too, in Monday's events.
	   The eastern city of Dresden broke ground for a synagogue on the
site of a Jewish temple destroyed in the war. And Berlin unveiled
blueprints for rebuilding its temple in the Mitte neighborhood, a
center of Jewish life before the war.
	   While both prewar synagogues sat about 2,000 people, the new
ones will have seats only for a few hundred, a sign of how far
Germany must go even to approach its number of Jews before the
Third Reich. Of the 11 million people who perished under the Nazis,
about 6 million were Jews.

U.S. envoy sees bodies of two slain Serb policemen

<TEXT>
	   MALISEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A visiting U.S. war crimes envoy saw
first-hand evidence Monday of the ongoing violence in Kosovo _ the
apparently executed bodies of two Serb policemen.
	   Angry Serb police threatened to beef up their patrols in
response to the killings.
	   David Scheffer, the roving U.S. ambassador on war crimes issues,
viewed the bodies in this devastated central village as he toured
Kosovo with the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission (KDOM).
	   ``This represents one of the problems that is being experienced
here with the cease-fire, and that is that there are violations of
the cease-fire by both sides,'' Scheffer said.
	   The policemen _ Ilija Vujosevic and Dejan Djatlov _ disappeared
Friday, the same day Serb police shot to death five ethnic Albanian
guerrillas, including a commander of two divisions.
	   Both of the slain policemen had gunshot wounds to the head,
indicating they had been killed execution-style. The bodies were
found earlier Monday by U.S. observers, who informed the police,
Serb media said.
	   Heavily armed Serb police formed a wide perimeter around the
area where the bodies were found, by the main road running through
Malisevo, while Scheffer inspected the site and was briefed by KDOM
observers.
	   Serb police spokesman Bozidar Filic said the executions showed
the Kosovo Liberation Army's utter disregard for the U.S.-sponsored
cease-fire.
	   He warned that unless ``international representatives'' secure
two main roads running through Malisevo by Wednesday, police will
increase their patrols and ``allow safe passage'' _ indicating a
possible new Serb action.
	   Serb authorities suspect the killed policemen were kidnapped by
the KLA in retaliation for the shootings of the five guerrillas.
	   The rebels say police shot at the five as they drove in two
vehicles from Opterusa village, while police claim the guerrillas
opened fire first.
	   Qamil Hajrizi, the father of one of the slain guerrillas, said
Monday that his son's body was riddled with bullets.
	   ``From what I saw, they were certainly ambushed,'' he said after
waiting about four hours to collect the body from a hospital morgue
in the southern city of Prizren. ``He was destroyed by many, many
bullets.''
	   Two teams of international observers helped Hajrizi, 50,
overcome intransigence by Serb police, who initially said the
father lacked the necessary paperwork to recover the remains. The
KDOM observers refused to speak to journalists.
	   A KLA figure called the killing of the five guerrillas an ambush
that violated a de facto cease-fire in Kosovo. Under a
four-week-old agreement between Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, Milosevic's forces were
supposed to cease hostilities.
	   Violence by both sides has increased in the past week, including
at least three incidents in which police reported killing KLA
fighters who shot at them first.
	   Scheffer and KDOM observers went to Malisevo to investigate the
report of the missing policemen as well as a gun battle Sunday
night reported by Serb police.
	   According to the Serb Media Center, guerrillas attacked
policemen staying in a Malisevo building with mortars and automatic
weapons and police fired back.
	   KDOM officials said the KLA reported three of its men were
wounded in the gunfight.

Iran seizes 1 ton of drugs, breaks up nine trafficking groups
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranian police have broken up nine drug
trafficking rings and seized 1 ton of drugs, the Islamic Republic
News Agency reported Monday.
	   The drugs and the gang members were seized in southern Fars
province last month, the agency reported. It did not say how many
people were detained or what type of drugs were seized.
	   Police also confiscated 41 vehicles, 6 motorcycles, cigarettes,
video sets, satellite dishes and computer equipment, the agency
said.
	   Large drug hauls, especially of heroin and opium, are common in
Iran, which lies on a route used by smugglers to get drugs from
Pakistan and Afghanistan to the oil-rich Gulf and Europe.
	   Iran has been cracking down on drug smugglers since 1988.
Hundreds of traffickers have been hanged under a law that mandates
the death penalty for anyone caught with more than a small quantity
of narcotics.

Irish politician says Iraq flexible on weapons crisis

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ An Irish politician who helped lay the
groundwork for the recent Northern Ireland peace accord said Monday
that Iraq is ``very flexible'' in seeking a solution over weapons
inspections and urged dialogue and not military action.
	   Former Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds, who was credited
with encouraging the Irish Republican Army's 1994 cease-fire, said
he believed Iraq had met 80 percent of U.N. demands on eliminating
its weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``That remaining 20 percent, in my view, does not justify a
strike or a return to conflict,'' Reynolds said, speaking at the
end of a three-day visit.
	   He told reporters that he found Iraq's deputy prime minister,
Tariq Aziz, ``open'' and ``very flexible'' in seeking a solution.
	   Iraq late last month halted cooperation with U.N. weapons
inspectors, saying they would not be allowed to work until the U.N.
Security Council moves to lift punishing sanctions imposed after
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The United States and Britain have threatened a military strike
to force Iraq to reverse the decision.
	   British Defense Secretary George Robertson warned Monday during
a visit to Kuwait that the patience of the international community
was ``draining away'' and that ``the option of force is there, is
real.''
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton met Sunday with his top security
advisers but put off a decision on whether to use force against
Iraq.
	   Reynolds said that he would travel to the United States on
Thursday to discuss the issue with U.S. politicians. Tam Dalyell, a
British parliament member from Scotland who accompanied Reynolds,
said he would speak with British leaders.
	   ``Today I would like to send a very clear message and a clear
call to the United Nations, to President Clinton and to (British)
Prime Minister Tony Blair that whatever (their feelings) about the
conflict, that everybody gets around the table to ... debate and
talk to remove the sanctions,'' Reynolds said.
	   He added: ``We believe that with good will on both sides, that a
compromise could be worked out.''
	   The visit by the Irish and British politicians was an echo of
the last crisis with Iraq in February when politicians from Russia,
Turkey and several Arab states showed up in Baghdad to try to press
for a diplomatic solution.
	   During that confrontation _ over Iraq's refusal to allow arms
inspectors into presidential palaces _ Washington and London also
threatened to use force. But Secretary-General Kofi Annan defused
the crisis by pledging to work toward lifting the sanctions.
	   Also on Monday, Hans von Sponeck, a German national, arrived in
Baghdad to take over as head of U.N. humanitarian operations in
Iraq. He replaces Irishman Denis Halliday, who left in September
after bitterly criticizing the sanctions for devastating the Iraqi
economy.
	   The humanitarian office oversees the U.N. oil-for-food program,
an exemption from the sanctions that lets Iraq sell limited
quantities of oil to buy needed food and medicine for its 22
million people.
	   Meanwhile, five more inspectors from the U.N. Special Commission
_ which is responsible for elimination of Iraq's chemical and
biological weapons as well as long-range missiles _ left the
country.
	   Iraq must cooperate with the weapons inspectors for the
sanctions to be lifted. Iraq says it has met the U.N. conditions,
but the arms monitors repeatedly have accused Iraq of withholding
information and misleading weapons teams.
	   UNSCOM began reducing its staff on Saturday, saying it was
useless to leave inspectors in Baghdad when they couldn't work. Ten
more are to depart Wednesday, bringing the total to 30, said
Caroline Cross, UNSCOM spokeswoman in Baghdad.
	   She noted that more than 100 U.N. weapons staffers remain in the
country and could resume inspections immediately if Iraq changes it
position.

Nazi war crimes trial put off again because of defendant's illness

	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ A judge suspended indefinitely the
trial of an alleged Nazi war criminal Monday, saying the accused is
too sick to appear in court.
	   The judge on Monday said a doctors' report showed Aleksandras
Lileikis, 91, is suffering from serious coronary disease and would
be unable to leave the hospital for several weeks.
	   Lileikis appeared briefly in court Thursday in a wheelchair, but
was rushed away in an ambulance after complaining of shortness of
breath.
	   Lileikis, who lived in the United States for 40 years after
World War II, is charged with genocide for allegedly turning over
scores of Jews to a Nazi execution squad when he was chief of the
Vilnius security police during the 1941-44 Nazi occupation.
	   The trial was to have begun in September, but was postponed
after doctors said Lileikis was too ill to come to court.
Lithuanian law does not allow trial in absentia for medical
reasons.
	   A medical panel appointed by the court to examine Lileikis at
that time confirmed that he is in poor health, but said he was
capable of appearing in court.
	   The repeated delays in getting the trial under way have angered
critics who claim that Lithuanian authorities have not pushed for a
speedy trial, perhaps hoping Lileikis would die.
	   A trial would draw attention to a painful period of Lithuania's
history. About 90 percent of the nation's pre-war Jewish population
of 240,000 died during the war years.
	   Lileikis emigrated to the United States and lived in Norwood,
Massachusetts, where he worked for a Lithuanian publishing house.
He returned to Lithuania in 1996 as the United States was moving to
revoke his citizenship on the grounds that he lied about his
background when he emigrated.
	   Lileikis' lawyer, Algirdas Matuiza, applauded the court's Monday
ruling.
	   ``This is obviously a question of a man's health,'' he said.
``They can't try him in absentia, so they have to wait until he's
in good shape. But this will definitely take time, at least until
next year.''

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - European Union foreign ministers on
Monday considered granting debt relief to Central American nations
hit by Hurricane Mitch as part of an aid package to help them
overcome the devastation.
	   The 15 EU member states and the Commission have pledged over
dlrs 100 million so far in humanitarian aid for Central America.
The EU Commission approved an additional dlrs 30 million in aid
late Monday, German officials said.
	   EU foreign ministers called for more assistance for Honduras,
Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua, where torrential rains and
mudslides have killed an estimated 10,000 people and left tens of
thousands of others without food and shelter.
	   But over the past few days the extent of the devastation has
proved to be greater than expected. German Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer told reporters urgent measures were needed to provide
victims with basic aid, including medicine, water sanitation and
shelter.
	   In the longer term, the ministers have asked the EU executive
Commission to come up with a series of proposals to help
reconstruction. These measures could include forgiving the
country's foreign debts or delaying their reimbursement.
	   ``It's an interesting proposal but it's not the only one,''
Ramon de Miguel, Spain's state secretary for foreign affairs, said.
	   The four Central American countries have foreign debts totaling
around dlrs 20 billion, mainly to international lending agencies.
Honduras owes dlrs 4.2 billion and Nicaragua owes dlrs 6 billion.
	   De Miguel said the ministers have asked the EU executive
Commission to come forward with a series of proposals by November
30, when development ministers are scheduled to meet in Brussels.
	   Both De Miguel and Fischer stressed that the EU and the United
States should coordinate aid efforts for the stricken region.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The new coordinator for U.N. humanitarian
programs in Iraq arrived Monday and pledged not to politicize his
mandate.
	   Hans von Sponeck, a German, said he planned to work closely with
Iraqi authorities and hopes ``he will never be seen as a manger of
sanctions.''
	   Von Sponeck replaces the outspoken Denis Halliday of Ireland,
who left his post in September after sharply criticizing the U.N.
trade sanctions that have devastated Iraq's economy.
	   A 30-year U.N. veteran, von Sponeck previously worked with the
U.N. Development Program in Geneva, Switzerland. His hometown was
not immediately available.
	   The sanctions were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
They limit the sale of oil and ban most other trade dealings.
	   The humanitarian coordinator oversees the U.N.-approved
oil-for-food program, launched in December 1996. It allows Iraq to
sell limited quantities of oil to buy needed food and medicine for
its 22 million people.
	   Von Sponeck told reporters on arrival at U.N. headquarters on
the outskirts of Baghdad that ``I do not want at this stage at all
to make any kind of statement concerning the relevance or
justification of sanctions.''
	   He arrived amid heightened tension between Iraq and the United
Nations over weapons inspections. Iraq has severed ties with the
U.N. Special Commission, which is responsible for overseeing the
destruction of Iraq's chemical and biological weapons as well as
long-range missiles.
	   U.N. Security Council diplomats have said they will only lift
the sanctions after Iraq fully cooperates with the commission.

Reformers criticize Russia's economic plan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A leading Russian reformer warned Monday that the
government's economic bailout plan will only deepen its troubles,
while another reformer blamed the International Monetary Fund for
aggravating the crisis.
	   Yegor Gaidar, a former prime minister who launched Russia's
first post-Soviet economic reforms, said that under the
government's plan, ``Russia's economic policies will be weak and
their results will be unfavorable. The crisis will be deepening.''
	   Gaidar, speaking at a conference in Kiev called by a top
Ukrainian reformer, Viktor Pynzenyk, blamed Russia's recent
foot-dragging on reforms for the current crisis.
	   Boris Nemtsov, a former Russian deputy prime minister also at
Monday's conference, said the IMF was partly to blame because it
``was trying to impose a program that the (Russian) government did
not want to implement.''
	   Nemtsov was fired along with the rest of the Russian government
in August after it stopped propping up the ruble and froze dlrs 40
billion in treasury bill debts, sending the economy into turmoil.
	   ``I think it is absolutely incorrect when IMF experts start
imposing their liberal requirements on governments, because these
requirements are impossible to implement from the very start,''
Nemtsov said.
	   Also Monday, Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov was quoted by The
Wall Street Journal as saying Russia would pay off the frozen
treasury bills with new ruble-denominated bonds and a small amount
of ruble cash.
	   Foreign creditors reached an agreement in London on Friday with
Russian officials on restructuring the debt. Zadornov said Russia
offered to pay 10 percent of the debt in cash and the rest in
bonds.
	   Foreign investors, who hold nearly one-third of the frozen debt,
have said they agreed to accept some ruble-denominated bonds.
	   Zadornov did not say, however, what exchange rate would be
applied to the new bonds, which is crucial because of the ruble's
volatility.
	   The ruble was hovering around 6 to the dollar until the August
devaluation, then plunged as low as 20 to the dollar. It has
recently stabilized at about 15 to the dollar.

Simitis: Cyprus will not be an obstacle in Poland's integration
</HEADLINE>
with EU &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Prime Minister Kostas Simitis, on a
two-day visit to Poland, said Monday that Poland's integration into
the European Union will not be threatened by Cyprus' aspirations to
join the union at the same time.
	   Simitis's visit came just a day before Poland opens membership
negotiations with the EU. The EU will also hold meetings on Tuesday
with five other aspiring nations: Cyprus, the Czech Republic,
Estonia, Hungary and Slovenia.
	   Greece wants Cyprus to join at the same time as the central
European countries. Poland supports the idea, but says it should
not be a condition for its own access.
	   Following a meeting with Poland's Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek,
Simitis said that Cyprus' complex political situation had been
known long before the 1994 decision to open negotiations with it
and there is no reason for it to become a problem at this point.
	   Cyprus has been split into a Greek Cypriot-controlled south and
a Turkish-occupied north since Turkey invaded the island in 1974,
following an abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   Simitis also pointed to the situation in the Balkans as a strong
argument for speeding up the process of European integration and of
NATO enlargement to guarantee peace and stability in Europe.
	   But he said that integration should be based on clear
principles, equal to all aspiring nations.
	   Simitis and Buzek agreed that the two nations should increase
economic, scientific and cultural ties. Shortly after their
meeting, government officials signed an agreement on scientific and
technical cooperation.
	   Poland offers political and economic stability and is a good
partner for investment and for developing cooperation, Buzek said.
	   Greece is the only partner where Poland's exports much more than
it imports. In 1997, turnover reached dlrs 183 million, in the
first seven moths of this year, it was dlrs 132 million.
	   Poland exports cars, raw materials, timber and cork. It imports
food, agricultural products and textiles.

six-month period. The earlier limit was dlrs 2 billion every six
months.
	   Food purchased under the program is distributed in monthly
rations to all Iraqis. About 150 U.N. food observers travel the
country to ensure that food and medical supplies are equitably
distributed to Iraqis.

Gary Hall Jr. gets three-month suspension; time served deducted
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Olympic gold medalist Gary Hall Jr.
and two other U.S. swimmers were cited by the sport's world
governing body Monday for drug offenses.
	   Hall was handed a three-month suspension by the doping panel of
the international federation (FINA) for testing positive for
marijuana.
	   However, FINA deducted the three months already served by Hall
under a temporary suspension, meaning he faces no further penalty.
	   Hall won gold medals as part of the U.S. 400-meter freestyle and
400 medley relay teams at the 1996 Atlanta Games. He also won
silver medals in the 50 and 100 freestyle.
	   Hall was suspended in July by FINA, which said he tested
positive for marijuana during a May 15 competition in his home city
of Phoenix. That prevented Hall from swimming in the Goodwill Games
in New York.
	   FINA said Hall had also tested positive for marijuana during the
1996 Olympics. He received only a warning then, however, because
FINA's ban on marijuana was not in effect at the time.
	   FINA secretary Gunnar Werner said Monday that the federation's
executive bureau had considered Hall guilty of a second offense,
which is punishable by a suspension of up to two years.
	   But he said that view was not upheld by the FINA doping panel,
which ruled it as a first offense.
	   In another case, Suzanne Black _ who won a gold medal in the 800
freestyle at last year's University Games in Sicily _ was suspended
for three months after testing positive for marijuana in an
unannounced doping control. FIFA did not specify the date and place
of the positive test.
	   Another American, Austin Ramirez, received a ``strong warning''
after testing positive for the stimulant Pemoline.
	   Ramirez could have faced a three-month suspension but FINA only
reprimanded him for failing to declare the product.
	   ``There were some special circumstances in that case,'' Werner
said. ``I think it was just a mistake.''

Swiss army joins in operation to cope with asylum seekers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RUETI, Switzerland (AP) _ Some 48 Swiss soldiers on Monday
joined efforts to house and feed an influx of refugees from
fighting in Serbia's Kosovo province.
	   The troops took over the care of 50 refugees, around half ethnic
Albanians fleeing from Kosovo, at the Gurnigelbad military
barracks, an emergency reception center.
	   The army is being used to take care of refugees for the first
time since 1956, when it was pressed into service to look after
people fleeing from the Soviet crackdown in Hungary.
	   In a personal letter to each of the soldiers, the chief of
staff, Corps Commander Hans-Ulrich Scherrer, said he hoped their
service would be ``calm, considered and carried out with
humanity''.
	   The government last month authorized the use of the army to help
house and feed the refugees for a provisional six-month period.
	   Refugees are expected to stay at the center for an average of
two weeks.
	   Last month, a small device went off at another barracks set
aside as an emergency reception center. There was no claim of
responsibility.
	   Switzerland had a record number of asylum applications _ almost
6,000 _ in October. Sixty-nine percent of them were from Yugoslav
citizens.
	   The influx is expected to push the number of asylum seekers to
an all-time high by the end of the year.
	   Also Monday, police found 14 refugees from Kosovo, one of them a
two-week-old baby, in a mountainous region of southeastern
Switzerland.
	   They had crossed into the country over the mountains from
neighboring Italy. Some were taken to a local clinic and the rest
to a reception center in the border town of Chiasso.

General tells army choir to stop singing about peace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli military general said army choirs
have no business singing peace songs because they promise a
situation the army cannot deliver, Israel TV reported Monday.
	   Gen. Yaakov Amidror, commander of the army's National Security
College, told a recent convention of senior army officers that two
popular peace songs, ``The Last War,'' and ``The Children of the
Winter of '73,'' should be banned from the army choir's repertoire.
	   ``We didn't promise peace, we didn't promise a dove with an
olive branch, and it's inappropriate for an army choir to sing
it,'' Israel TV quoted Amidror as telling the convention.
	   Left wing politicians decried Amidror's criticism and called for
his resignation.
	   Amidror apparently cited lyrics including, ``I promise you, my
little girl, that this will be the last war,'' from the song
written in the wake of the 1973 Mideast war, as objectionable.
	   In a statement released to the press, Amidror neither confirmed
nor denied he made the remarks. He said only that his comments were
made in a private forum and that it was inappropriate to discuss
them with the media. The Israeli army said only that Amidror was
expressing his personal opinion.

Norway asks Turkey to allow human activist to travel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Norway on Monday asked Turkey to reverse a
travel ban for leading human rights activist Akin Birdal and allow
him to come to this northern country for medical treatment and
meetings.
	   Birdal, who recently survived an assassination attempt, last
month was sentenced in Turkey to one year in prison for inciting
racial hatred in a speech two years ago. He had called for a
peaceful solution to end a war between autonomy-seeking Kurds and
government troops in southeastern Turkey.
	   It was not clear when Birdal was to begin serving his sentence,
and Norway had invited him to Oslo for physical therapy for the
gunshot wounds he suffered in the assassination attempt. He was
also to have met Norwegian leaders, and hold a lecture at the
Norwegian Nobel Institute, the headquarters of the Nobel Peace
Prize.
	   Norwegian Foreign Ministry spokesman Ingvard Havnen said Birdal
had been denied permission to leave Turkey on Monday.
	   ``We have expressed strong concern and have encouraged the
Turkish authorities to reverse that decision,'' Havnen said by
telephone.
	   Birdal is a prominent campaigner against torture and the army's
forced evacuation of Kurdish villages in southeastern Turkey. He is
head of the country's Human Rights Association.

Club Med to remain closed after hostage standoff
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FORT-DE-FRANCE, Martinique (AP) _ A Club Mediterrannee where
strikers held 373 tourists hostage over the weekend will remain
closed until managers reach a deal with trade unions, the
Paris-based resort chain said Monday.
	   Police in riot gear raided the resort on the Caribbean island of
Martinique on Sunday night to free the guests.
	   Unions claimed four employees were injured during the raid, and
some were treated for inhalation of tear gas used by the police.
None of guests _ most of them French, German and Italian _ were
hurt.
	   About 200 employees at the Club Med in south coast Ste-Anne
struck Wednesday to demand 8 percent raises. When negotiations with
managers collapsed Saturday, the workers blocked the hotel's
entrances and refused to let guests leave.
	   Tourists said they were not mistreated by the hostage-takers.
The resorts pools and other facilities remained open, and managers
took over cooking for the guests.
	   After the raid, police buses took guests to other hotels.
	   The resort will remain closed until there is a labor agreement,
said Club Med spokesman Christian Mure.

Bosnian flag burned in protest of international policy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ A Bosnian Serb who was
imprisoned for advocating a unified Bosnia burned the country's
flag in downtown Sarajevo, protesting the role of the international
community in Bosnia.
	   Vladimir Srebrov, a writer before and a political activist
during and after the 1992-1995 war in Bosnia, was one of the
founders of the Serb Democratic Party, later run by war-crimes
suspect No. 1, Radovan Karadzic.
	   Srebrov distanced himself from the party before the fighting
started and continued to work against it till he was jailed by the
Bosnian Serbs as a ``traitor of the Serb cause''.
	   According to the Bosnian news agency BH Press, Srebrov said his
intention was to symbolically ``burn'' the influence of the office
of Carlos Westendorp, the chief international envoy to Bosnia, and
other international organizations.

	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ Overwhelmed by disaster,
grim-faced Central American leaders met Monday in El Salvador to
appeal for more international aid in recovering from Hurricane
Mitch even as a growing army of rescue workers struggled to help
hundreds of thousands of victims.
	   With at least 10,000 reported dead and their economies shattered
by flooding, the leaders were expected to ask help with foreign
debts and to coordinate long-term relief efforts after one of the
worst natural disasters of this century in the Americas.
	   Some European leaders already were proposing such help, echoing
a proposal made last week by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter.
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin on Monday urged a moratorium on
debt payments owed by countries hit by Hurricane Mitch.
	   French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn said the Paris
Club of creditor nations should suspend their debt service payments
for the next two to three years.
	   German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer was also urging that
some debts be forgiven.
	   Honduras owes dlrs 4.2 billion and Nicaragua owes dlrs 6
billion, mainly to international lending agencies.
	   Government and independent relief organizations from around the
world were trying to rush aid to tens of thousands in Honduras and
Nicaragua isolated by ruptured roads, backed-up airports and too
few helicopters.
	   Many areas were still receiving their first aid, more than a
week after the storm disappeared.
	   ``We heard on the radio that aid is coming, but we're still
eating rice,'' said Ann Soto, 19, at a refugee shelter in Posoltega
in Nicaragua.
	   Former U.S. President George Bush, visiting the Honduran capital
of Tegucigalpa, said Sunday that aid might be needed for years to
come. ``The devastation is appalling,'' he said.
	   In Honduras alone, 700,000 people will need food for the next
month, U.N. World Food Program representative Giuseppi Lubatti
estimated.
	   Presidents Carlos Flores Facusse of Honduras, Arnoldo Aleman of
Nicaragua, Armando Calderon Sol of El Salvador and Miguel Angel
Rodriguez of Costa Rica met at San Salvador's international airport
for a quick summit.
	   Guatemalan Foreign Minister Eduardo Stein also attended the
meeting, representing President Alvaro Arzu. There was none of the
jovial backslapping customary at regional summits as most of the
leaders walked grimly past reporters into their session.
	   Officials said the presidents were likely to try to find ways to
coordinate often-chaotic relief efforts and to plan long-term
priorities _ such as restoring destroyed roads.
	   They also were planning to urge the United States to keep
postponing deportations of illegal immigrants, Salvadoran Foreign
Minister Ramon Gonzalez said Sunday.
	   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service temporarily
suspended deportations of immigrants to Honduras and Guatemala as a
``humanitarian gesture'' until Tuesday.
	   Britain said some 1,400 Royal Navy and Royal Marines personnel
were helping with relief efforts in the region, sending medical
teams to some of the worst-hit areas.
	   U.S. military engineers were helping repair roads, bridges and
water systems while moving relief supplies into the country.
	   Private charities were sending doctors into remote parts of
Honduras and Nicaragua.
	   In Nicaragua, where critics have accused the government of being
slow with relief help, the Interior Ministry confirmed Monday it
had expelled a U.S. woman under contract with the U.S. Agency for
International Development, Julie Gare Noble, for a ``slanderous,
tendentious and baseless report.''
	   Presidential spokesman Gilberto Wong said Noble, who works with
non-governmental organizations in Wisconsin, had suggested that aid
for Nicaragua go through non-governmental groups, ``making it
understood that the government was not reliable.''

 &UR; Israel to delay West Bank withdrawal despite U.S. pressure
 &UR; Eds: AMs. LEADS with fresh comment and details; Changes byline &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ As the first deadline in the Mideast
peace accord came and went Monday, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu ignored U.S. pressure to stick to the timetable and said
he would not go forward until the Palestinians combat militants.
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, said Israel will
also likely miss the land-for-security agreement's Nov. 16
withdrawal date, when Israeli troops are to begin a phased pullout
from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   ``There will be a few days' delay, I presume,'' Bar-Illan said.
	   Already, the accord has fallen one week behind schedule. The
deal, which is to be implemented over 12-weeks, was to have taken
effect one week ago but has been held up by Israel over requests
for clarifications on Palestinian obligations under the deal. After
a suicide bombing in a Jerusalem market on Friday, Israel's Cabinet
suspended indefinitely debate over the agreement until the
Palestinians do more to fight Islamic militant groups.
	   ``We would like to proceed with the agreement as soon as we have
assurances that the spate of terrorist bombings have been taken
care of by systematic comprehensive action by the Palestinians,''
Netanyahu said.
	   But the Palestinians said they are carrying out their
commitments and said Israel is using the security issue as a stall
tactic.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said the agreement is ``as
good as dead'' if Israel refuses to carry out the withdrawals on
time. ``He (Netanyahu) cannot expect to have implementation of one
part of the agreement, our commitments, and postpone the other
part,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, Israel and the United States appeared to be at odds
over three key issues is the accord _ the time table, continued
Jewish settlement expansion and the procedure for revoking
provisions in the PLO founding charter calling for Israel's
destruction.
	   U.S. embassy spokesman Larry Schwartz said that in a phone call
last week, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told
Netanyahu that she expected Israel to implement the agreement on
time.
	   ``Our understanding is that the Wye timetable will not slip,''
Schwartz told The Associated Press. ``The timetable is meant to
continue as it was signed.''

Wiranto says Indonesia armed forces might discuss limit on
</HEADLINE>
political role &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA (AP) _ Indonesian military chief Gen. Wiranto said
Monday that the armed forces was willing to discuss demands to
limit its prominent role in politics, the official Antara news
agency reported.
	   He said any decisions should be left to the 1,000-member
People's Consultative Assembly, which includes a sizable military
faction.
	   The Southeast Asian nation's highest legislative body meets
Tuesday to debate how to reform the tightly controlled political
system that kept Suharto in office for so long. The Asian financial
crisis led to riots that toppled Suharto five months ago.
	   ``The problem is not in agreeing or disagreeing, but we cannot
preempt the final result of the session,'' Antara quoted Wiranto as
saying.
	   One proposal to be considered by the assembly would reduce the
number of seats allotted to the military in the 500-seat Parliament
from 75 to 55. The military began scaling back its role in politics
in the final years of the authoritarian rule of Suharto, a former
army general.
	   Student protesters, however, say all members of Parliament
should be elected and appointed seats should be abolished.
	   In line with reforms, Wiranto said the military planned to
reduce the number of active military officers holding civilian
positions in the government.
	   He also announced that the name of a top military post, the
chief of staff for socio-political affairs, would be changed to
chief of staff for territorial affairs.
	   It was not immediately clear if the duties of the officer
holding the post would change.

Terrorist charged in Romania; open bank account found

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The international terrorist known as
``Carlos the Jackal'' was charged with crimes against humanity in
Romania, and an open bank account was found in his name, a military
prosecutor said Monday.
	   ``Carlos' collaborators' network may still be active in
Romania,'' national television quoted Gen. Dan Voinea as saying.
	   Voinea announced that Romania charged Carlos, whose real name is
Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, of undermining the peace and committing
crimes against humanity. He did not say when the charges were
filed.
	   Prosecutors accused Ramirez of committing several terrorist acts
in France and Germany between 1977 and 1981, following orders of
Romania's Communist dictator, Nicolae Ceausescu.
	   ``The German secret service told us Carlos rented a car in
Germany using false documents provided by Romania,'' Voinea said.
	   He added that Romania's communist-era secret services, the
Securitate and the Foreign Information Service, had files on
Ramirez which might be useful to the investigation.
	   ``But these files are still secret,'' said the military
prosecutor. He did not explain why the files cannot be accessed
now, nine years after the end of communism.
	   Ramirez is imprisoned in France, serving a life term for
shooting two French police investigators and a Lebanese man.
	   Romanian media reported early this year that Ramirez had been
employed by Ceausescu to blow up the Romanian Service of Radio Free
Europe in February 1981.
	   Nine people were injured in the attack on the Munich-based radio
program, which broadcast into communist Eastern Europe.
	   The dictator allegedly was infuriated by Radio Free Europe's
anti-communist broadcasts and by the defection of his intelligence
service chief, Gen. Ion Pacepa, to the United States in 1978.
	   Ramirez found temporary shelter in Romania between 1980 and
1989.
	   Ceausescu was killed during the anti-communist revolt in 1989.
	   Ramirez was captured in Sudan in August 1994.
	   The 48-year-old Venezuelan-born terrorist is believed
responsible for the deaths of at least 83 people during his
terrorist career in Europe and the Middle East.

 &UR; Israel to delay West Bank withdrawal despite U.S. pressure
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with fresh comment and details; Changes

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ As the first deadline in the Mideast
peace accord came and went Monday, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu ignored U.S. pressure to stick to the timetable and said
he would not go forward until the Palestinians combat militants.
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, said Israel will
also likely miss the land-for-security agreement's Nov. 16
withdrawal date, when Israeli troops are to begin a phased pullout
from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   ``There will be a few days' delay, I presume,'' Bar-Illan said.
	   Already, the accord has fallen one week behind schedule. The
start of the deal, which is to be implemented over 12 weeks, has
been held up for one week by Israel over requests for
clarifications on Palestinian obligations under the deal. After a
Friday suicide bombing in a Jerusalem market, Israel's Cabinet
suspended indefinitely debate over the agreement until the
Palestinians do more to fight Islamic militant groups.
	   ``We would like to proceed with the agreement as soon as we have
assurances that the spate of terrorist bombings have been taken
care of by systematic comprehensive action by the Palestinians,''
Netanyahu said.
	   But the Palestinians said they are carrying out their
commitments and said Israel is using the security issue as a stall
tactic.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said the agreement is ``as
good as dead'' if Israel refuses to carry out the withdrawals on
time. ``He (Netanyahu) cannot expect to have implementation of one
part of the agreement, our commitments, and postpone the other
part,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, Israel and the United States appeared to be at odds
over three key issues is the accord _ the timetable, continued
Jewish settlement expansion and the procedure for revoking
provisions in the PLO founding charter calling for Israel's
destruction.
	   U.S. embassy spokesman Larry Schwartz said that in a phone call
last week, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told
Netanyahu that she expected Israel to implement the agreement on
time.
	   ``Our understanding is that the Wye timetable will not slip,''
Schwartz told The Associated Press. ``The timetable is meant to
continue as it was signed.''

 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Gen. Augusto Pinochet should be freed to return to
Chile whose courts could then decide whether he has immunity from
allegations of genocide, murder and torture during his 17-year
rule, his lawyers urged in Britain's highest court Monday.
	   Outside the House of Lords where five judges are hearing a bid
to uphold Pinochet's arrest on a Spanish extradition warrant,
Chilean opponents reacted angrily to a statement by the former
dictator defending his 1973 overthrow of a Marxist President
Salvador Allende and saying, ``I am at peace with myself, and with
the Chilean people.''
	   ``The ex-dictator ... (has made) not even the most minor gesture
of repentance for the brutal acts he committed during his
government,'' the son of Orlando Letelier, Allende's foreign
minister killed in a 1976 car-bombing in Washington, told
reporters.
	   ``He simply ignores them,'' added Juan Pablo Letelier, a
congressman who is among prominent Chileans _ both opponents and
supporters of Pinochet _ who have come to London to lobby.
	   In court, Clare Montgomery, one of several top lawyers appearing
for Pinochet, also argued that if the British judges upheld the
arrest of the 82-year-old general it would imperil Chile's fragile
democracy.
	   She noted there are 11 proceedings against Pinochet in Chile,
adding, ``it will be for the court there to decide whether he is to
be accorded immunity.''
	   So far, Pinochet has enjoyed immunity in his native land as a
senator for life and under laws he instigated while in office. He
stepped down in 1990.

U.S. Army identifies pilots killed in crash of RC-12 aircraft on
</HEADLINE>
Friday &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HEIDELBERG, Germany (AP) - The U.S. Army on Monday identified
two pilots who were killed while on a routine training mission when
their RC-12 reconnaissance plane crashed near the town of Erlach,
southeast of Wuerzburg on Friday.
	   A statement from the 5th U.S. Army Corps in Heidelberg
identified the men as Chief Warrant Officer Daniel W. Hunger, 36,
and 2nd Lt. Kelly Hall. Both soldiers were assigned to the 1st
Military Intelligence Battalion, 205th Military Brigade in
Wiesbaden, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of Frankfurt.
	   Hall is survived by his wife Shelly R. Hall and their five
children and CWO Hunter is survived by his wife Capt. Lori K.
Hunter, the statement said.
	   The twin-engine RC-12 was on a training flight when it crashed
and burst into flames in an unpopulated area between Sommerhausen
and Erlach, the military said.
	   The Beechcraft turboprop was believed to have taken off from
Wiesbaden, where part of the 5th Corps is based. The plane, one of
the Army's older models, carries out reconnaissance missions as
well as other types of flights.
	   An investigation into the cause of the accident continues.

U.S. envoy views bodies of two Serb policemen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MALISEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A visiting U.S. war crimes envoy saw
first-hand evidence Monday of the ongoing violence in Kosovo _ the
bodies of two Serb policemen who were apparently executed.
	   David Scheffer, the roving U.S. ambassador on war crimes issues,
viewed the corpses in the devastated central village of Malisevo as
he toured Kosovo with the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission
(KDOM).
	   ``This represents one of the problems that is being experienced
here with the cease-fire, and that is that there are violations of
the cease-fire by both sides,'' Scheffer said.
	   Dozens of Serb police are believed to have been killed since the
start of a crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists last February
in Kosovo. Ethnic Albanians make up about 90 percent of the
population in the province in southern Serbia, the main Yugoslav
republic.
	   Several hundred other people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have been
killed in the fighting, and as many as 300,000 driven from their
homes.
	   The policemen disappeared Friday, the same day that Serb police
shot to death five ethnic Albanian guerrillas, including a
commander of two divisions.
	   Both of the slain policemen had gunshot wounds to the head,
indicating they had been killed execution-style. U.S. observers
found the bodies Monday, Serb media said.
	   It was unclear if their deaths were intended as retribution for
the killing of the five Kosovo Liberation Army members. The rebels
say police ambushed the five as they drove in two vehicles from
Opterusa village, while police claim the guerrillas fired first on
a police patrol.
	   The KLA and Serb police traded accusations Monday that the
recent killing proved that the other side violated a cease-fire.
	   Under a four-week-old agreement between Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, Milosevic's
forces were supposed to cease hostilities.
	   The KLA was not a party to the Oct. 12 agreement, but has
declared its own unilateral cease-fire except in the case of
attacks by Serb and Yugoslav forces.
	   Violence by both sides has increased in the past week, including
at least three incidents in which police reported killing KLA
fighters who shot at them first. No police were killed or injured
in any of those incidents.
	   Qamil Hajrizi, the father of one of the slain guerrillas, said
Monday that his son's body was riddled with bullets.
	   ``From what I saw, they were certainly ambushed,'' he said after
waiting about four hours to collect the body from a hospital morgue
in the southern city of Prizren. ``He was destroyed by many, many
bullets.''

(KDOM).
	   ``This represents one of the problems that is being experienced
here with the cease-fire, and that is that there are violations of
the cease-fire by both sides,'' Scheffer said.
	   Dozens of Serb police are believed to have been killed since the
start of a crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists last February
in Kosovo. Ethnic Albanians make up about 90 percent of the
population in the province in southern Serbia, the main Yugoslav
republic.
	   Several hundred other people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have been
killed in the fighting, and as many as 300,000 driven from their
homes.
	   The policemen disappeared Friday, the same day that Serb police
shot to death five ethnic Albanian guerrillas, including a
commander of two divisions.
	   Both of the slain policemen had gunshot wounds to the head,
indicating they had been killed execution-style. U.S. observers
found the bodies Monday, Serb media said.
	   It was unclear if their deaths were intended as retribution for
the killing of the five Kosovo Liberation Army members. The rebels
say police ambushed the five as they drove in two vehicles from
Opterusa village, while police claim the guerrillas fired first on
a police patrol.
	   The KLA and Serb police traded accusations Monday that the
recent killing proved that the other side violated a cease-fire.
	   Under a four-week-old agreement between Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, Milosevic's
forces were supposed to cease hostilities.
	   The KLA was not a party to the Oct. 12 agreement, but has
declared its own unilateral cease-fire except in the case of
attacks by Serb and Yugoslav forces.
	   Violence by both sides has increased in the past week, including
at least three incidents in which police reported killing KLA
fighters who shot at them first. No police were killed or injured
in any of those incidents.
	   Qamil Hajrizi, the father of one of the slain guerrillas, said
Monday that his son's body was riddled with bullets.
	   ``From what I saw, they were certainly ambushed,'' he said after
waiting about four hours to collect the body from a hospital morgue
in the southern city of Prizren. ``He was destroyed by many, many
bullets.''

Wood wins American baseball's National League Rookie award
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Kerry Wood was narrowly voted Rookie of the Year
for North American baseball's National League on Monday, capping a
season in which he struck out 20 batters in a game and helped the
Chicago Cubs make the playoffs for the first time since 1989.
	   The 21-year-old right-hander received 16 first-place votes and
16 seconds to finish with 128 points in balloting by the Baseball
Writers' Association of America for the award, which honors the
best first-year player.
	   Colorado Rockies first baseman Todd Helton got 15 firsts, 14
seconds and two thirds for 119 points.
	   Arizona first baseman Travis Lee was next with 21 points and
Atlanta closer Kerry Ligtenberg, who received the other first-place
vote, was fourth with 18 points.
	   Wood was 13-6 with a 3.40 earned run average in 26 starts,
striking out 233 in 166 2-3 innings. He was even more impressive at
Wrigley Field, going 9-1 with a 2.97 ERA in 13 starts during the
regular season.
	   Baseball took notice of Wood on May 6 when he struck out 20 _
only Roger Clemens had done it in a nine-inning game _ while
pitching a one-hitter against Houston.
	   He was the odds-on favorite to win the rookie award heading into
the final month of the season. But because of a dead arm, his start
against Cincinnati on Aug. 31 was his last of the regular season.
	   Wood returned in Game 3 of the NL playoffs, allowing one run _
not earned _ against Atlanta as the Cubs were eliminated.
	   Helton batted .315 with 25 homers and 97 runs batted in, taking
over at first base for the Rockies after Andres Galarraga left to
sign with Atlanta following the 1997 season. Ligtenberg replaced
Mark Wohlers as the Braves' closer and finished with 30 saves.
	   The Rookie of the Year award for the American League, the other
of two leagues in North American Major League Baseball, will be
announced Tuesday. Oakland outfielder Ben Grieve and New York
Yankees pitcher Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez are the favorites.

General tells army choir to stop singing about peace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli military general said army choirs
have no business singing peace songs because they promise a
situation the army cannot deliver, Israel TV reported Monday.
	   Gen. Yaakov Amidror, commander of the army's National Security
College, told a recent convention of senior army officers that two
popular peace songs, ``The Last War,'' and ``The Children of the
Winter of '73,'' should be banned from the army choir's repertoire.
	   ``We didn't promise peace, we didn't promise a dove with an
olive branch, and it's inappropriate for an army choir to sing
it,'' Israel TV quoted Amidror as telling the convention.
	   Leftist politicians decried Amidror's criticism and called for
his resignation.
	   Amidror apparently cited lyrics including, ``I promise you, my
little girl, that this will be the last war,'' from the song
written in the wake of the 1973 Mideast war, as objectionable.
	   In a statement released to the press, Amidror neither confirmed
nor denied he made the remarks. He said only that his comments were
made in a private forum and that it was inappropriate to discuss
them with the media. The Israeli army said only that Amidror was
expressing his personal opinion.

Jewish settlers grab West Bank land before Israeli pullback
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo JRL108 &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GIVAT HAREL, West Bank (AP) _ Three prefab homes perched on a
rocky slope of the West Bank are the Jewish settlers' answer to the
Wye peace accord.
	   In the face of Israel's agreement to turn over 13 percent of the
West Bank to the Palestinians, the settlers have seized at least
five strategic hilltops to keep land out of Palestinian hands.
	   Settler leaders acknowledged for the first time Thursday that
those taking land were not acting on their own, but as part of an
organized campaign.
	   ``These are lands that belong to us, by contract. If we don't
grab them, someone else will, so we're grabbing them,'' said Aharon
Domb, leader of the Jewish settlement movement.
	   Evidence of the settlers' last-minute push is evident on
hilltops down the middle ridge of the West Bank. Every few miles
(kilometers), water towers stick up from the landscape on spidery
legs, with a few blocklike houses surrounding them like flies
caught in a web. Those are instant settlements like Givat Harel.
	   This is the West Bank heartland, far from Israeli cities, and
the focus of the settlers' land claim.
	   The hill-hopping has prompted new friction between the
government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the United
States.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told Netanyahu in a
phone call last week that expansion of settlements now is a
``provocation,'' the newspaper Maariv said Monday. Israel denied
it.
	   U.S. Embassy spokesman Larry Schwartz said he could not comment
on the Netanyahu-Albright conversation, but that Israelis and
Palestinian undertook during last month's Mideast summit to refrain
from unilateral actions that might prejudice the outcome of a
permanent peace agreement.
	   He said he hoped Israel's government would realize that new
settler outposts are ``not appropriate,'' and would dismantle them.
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, said that the
settlement activity ``may be an irritant, but certainly is not
against the agreement.''
	   He said the trailers were set up on state land within the
municipal boundaries of existing settlements. ``We are not doing
anything for the time being because it's not illegal.''
	   One of the new outposts is Givat Harel, set up three weeks ago.
It consists of three prefab homes on a hill south of the
Palestinian town of Nablus, the largest in the West Bank.
	   An army patrol stops by from time to time to make sure the three
settler families are safe, but soldiers have not asked the
squatters to leave.
	   On Thursday, Elyashiv Drori and David Angel guarded the site
while the others were away at work.
	   Sitting at a small table in his new home, Drori said the site
was picked because it's at the center of an empty area surrounded
by three other Jewish settlements _ Eli, Shilo and Maale Levona.
	   ``If there is a group of settlements, instead of individual
ones, the Israeli government will have to take them more seriously
and it will be less likely to leave them isolated'' in areas that
will come under Palestinian control, he said.
	   Drori said even a relatively small number of people could be
effective in claiming land.
	   ``Three families can farm as much land as a thousand families
can live on,'' said Drori, 25, a slim, quiet man with a boyish face
and open smile. He wore jeans, a T-shirt and a small knitted
skullcap held with a clip to his close-cropped hair.
	   Associated Press reporters have visited three new outposts over
the past week, and the Haaretz daily said a total of five have been
established since last month.

Kuwait thrashes Oman 5-0 in Gulf Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Defending champion Kuwait beat Oman 5-0
Monday and moved back into the race for the title of the six-nation
Gulf Cup.
	   Kuwaiti players dominated the game, with the first goal coming
in the 36th minute by forward Jassim al-Huwaidy, who scored five
goals in an earlier match against Qatar.
	   The second goal came in the 52nd minute from Badr Haji and the
last three goals in the 81, 82nd and 85th minutes. Al-Huwaidy
scored the fifth goal for Kuwait.
	   The Omani team could not penetrate the strong Kuwaiti defense,
which kept the Omanis at a safe distance from the goal post.
	   Monday's win gives eight-time champion Kuwait nine points in the
cup standing, just one below Saudi Arabia's total.
	   Saudi Arabia, which is the favorite to win the cup, next faces
Qatar, which is at the bottom rung with only 2 points. A win would
give the Saudis the title.
	   Kuwait faces third-place United Arab Emirates on Thursday, the
last day of the tournament.

U.S. envoy sees bodies of two slain Serb policemen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; UPDATES with Scheffer quote in 25th graf

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MALISEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A visiting U.S. war crimes envoy saw
first-hand evidence Monday of the ongoing violence in Kosovo _ the
apparently executed bodies of two Serb policemen.
	   Angry Serb police threatened to beef up their patrols in
response to the killings.
	   David Scheffer, the roving U.S. ambassador on war crimes issues,
viewed the bodies in this devastated central village as he toured
the area with the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission (KDOM).
	   ``This represents one of the problems that is being experienced
here with the cease-fire, and that is that there are violations of
the cease fire by both sides,'' Scheffer said.
	   The policemen _ Ilija Vujosevic and Dejan Djatlov _ disappeared
Friday, the same day Serb police shot to death five ethnic Albanian
guerrillas, including a commander of two divisions.
	   Both of the slain policemen had gunshot wounds to the head,
indicating they had been killed execution-style. The bodies were
found earlier Monday by foreign observers, who informed the police,
Serb media said.
	   Serb police spokesman Bozidar Filic said the executions showed
the Kosovo Liberation Army's utter disregard for the U.S.-sponsored
cease-fire.
	   He warned that unless ```international representatives'' secure
two main roads running through Malisevo by Wednesday, police will
increase their patrols and ``allow safe passage'' _ indicating a
possible new Serb action.
	   Serb authorities suspect the killed policemen were kidnapped by
the KLA in retaliation for the shootings of the five guerrillas.
	   The rebels say police shot at the five as they drove in two
vehicles from Opterusa village, while police claim the guerrillas
opened fire first.
	   Qamil Hajrizi, the father of one of the slain guerrillas, said
Monday that his son's body was riddled with bullets.
	   ``From what I saw, they were certainly ambushed,'' he said after
waiting about four hours to collect the body from a hospital morgue
in the southern city of Prizren. ``He was destroyed by many, many
bullets.''
	   Two teams of KDOM observers helped Hajrizi, 50, overcome
intransigence by Serb police, who initially said the father lacked
the necessary paperwork to recover the remains. The KDOM observers
refused to speak to journalists.
	   A KLA figure called the killing of the five guerrillas an ambush
that violated a de facto cease-fire in Kosovo. Under a
four-week-old agreement between Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, Milosevic's forces were
supposed to cease hostilities.
	   Violence by both sides has increased in the past week, including
at least three incidents in which police reported killing KLA
fighters who shot at them first.
	   Scheffer and KDOM observers went to Malisevo to investigate the
deaths of the two policemen as well as a gunbattle Sunday night
reported by Serb police.
	   According to the Serb Media Center, guerrillas attacked
policemen staying in a Malisevo building with mortars and automatic
weapons and police fired back.
	   KDOM officials said the KLA reported three of its men were
wounded in the gunfight.
	   Dozens of Serb police have been killed before and after the
start of a Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists last
February in Kosovo, a majority Albanian province. Several hundred
other people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have been killed, and as
many as 300,000 driven from their homes.
	   More than 50,000 refugees who had been living in the open have
come down from the hills into villages, though many cannot return
home due to the damage to their houses or fear of a continued Serb
police presence. With the first coating of snow arriving this week
in southern mountains, relief officials remain worried that some
refugees could still face exposure to harsher winter weather
expected soon.
	   Scheffer came to Kosovo on a one-day fact-finding tour after
attending a panel discussion on war crimes in Belgrade.
	   His visit comes amid a continuing controversy over the failure
of Yugoslav authorities to cooperate with the United Nations war
crimes panel trying to investigate allegations of atrocities in
Kosovo.
	   Louise Arbour, chief prosecutor for the International War Crimes
Tribunal, and a team of investigators planned a weeklong mission in
Kosovo but were refused access to the province.
	   Arbour and Scheffer have threatened Yugoslavia with U.N.
sanctions if they don't get unlimited access.
	   ``There's no question that any visual observation of this area
of Kosovo reveals what appear to be war crimes,'' Scheffer said
Monday.

Archbishop accuses Turkey of harassing Orthodox spiritual leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The head of Greece's church on Monday
accused Turkey of harassing the spiritual leader of the world's 300
million Orthodox Christians.
	   Archbishop Christodoulos, leader of the Orthodox Church of
Greece, said a decision last week by the Turkish government to
dismiss the board members of the Halki school of theology in
Istanbul, Turkey, was ``undemocratic.''
	   ``It is an undemocratic measure against freedom that goes not
just against the Ecumenical Patriarchate and its foundations,''
said Christodoulos. ``It is directed against democracy, freedom and
humanity.''
	   Although Istanbul-based Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew does
not hold the same position as a Roman Catholic pope, he is
considered ``first among equals'' among the patriarchs that lead
Orthodox churches around the world.
	   According to the church, the Halki board of directors was
dismissed last week because it refused to seek government
permission to visit a monastery where the school is located on a
small island near Istanbul.
	   A seminary college on Halki has been closed since 1971, when the
Turkish government shut it down under a law requiring that higher
education in religious and military training be controlled by the
state. A high school remained open until 1985.
	   Halki was the training ground for many Greek Orthodox leaders,
especially the ecumenical patriarchs, to whom the majority of the
world's Orthodox look for leadership.
	   Although closed, the school retained a board, and Bartholomew
has unsuccessfully lobbied the Turkish government to reopen it.
	   According to local media, Bartholomew was deeply angered by the
Turkish government decision.
	   ``I have the duty and responsibility to state that our rights
are not being respected,'' Bartholomew was quoted as saying.

Juventus saying it might buy another striker. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TURIN (AP) _ A torn knee ligament will sideline Alessandro Del
Piero for at least five months, the star striker for Italy and
Juventus of Turin told reporters Monday.
	   Del Piero was injured in a collision with Udinese defender
Valerio Bertotto during Juve's 2-2 Siere A game at Udine on Sunday.
	   Del Piero, who turned 24 on Monday, has been mired in a slump
since the spring, including a disappointing World Cup for Italy.
His birthday couldn't have been worse, Del Piero said.
	   ``Yesterday, I was very depressed, also because my knee hurt so
much,'' he said. ``But today I feel more relieved - because waiting
was worse.''
	   Doctors planned to wait before deciding whether to operate.
	   Juventus manager Luciano Moggi said Juventus might move to buy
another striker.
	   ``If we do, it'll be someone important, although there isn't
another Del Piero,'' Moggi was quoted as saying by the ANSA news
agency. Moggi gave no indications as to who the new player might
be.

Kuwait thrashes Oman 5-0 in Gulf Cup soccer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Defending champion Kuwait beat Oman 5-0
Monday and moved back into the race for the title of the six-nation
Gulf Cup.
	   Kuwaiti players dominated the game, with the first goal coming
in the 36th minute by forward Jassim al-Huwaidy, who scored five
goals in an earlier match against Qatar.
	   The second goal came in the 52nd minute from Badr Haji and the
last three goals in the 81, 82nd and 85th minutes. Al-Huwaidy
scored the fifth goal for Kuwait.
	   The Omani team could not penetrate the strong Kuwaiti defense,
which kept the Omanis at a safe distance from the goal post.
	   Monday's win gives eight-time champion Kuwait nine points in the
cup standing, just one below Saudi Arabia's total.
	   Saudi Arabia, which is the favorite to win the cup, next faces
Qatar, which is at the bottom rung with only 2 points. A win would
give the Saudis the title.
	   Kuwait faces third-place United Arab Emirates on Thursday, the
last day of the tournament.

Russian Muslims condemn lawmakers' anti-Semitism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Muslim leaders on Monday joined a growing
chorus of critics angry at the Communist Party for defending
anti-Semitic remarks by a fellow party member.
	   The comments by lawmaker Albert Makashov and the Communists'
failure to denounce them ``evoke serious concern about the fate of
civil peace and interethnic accord in Russia,'' Russia's Muslim
Board said in a statement quoted by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Makashov's remarks _ he blamed Russia's troubles on ``zhidy,''
or ``yids'' _ were the latest example of anti-Semitism in a country
where discrimination against Jews runs deep and has been
increasingly given expression by Communist and nationalist
politicians.
	   Muslims, who make up the second-largest religious group in
Russia after Orthodox Christians, are also often targeted for
discrimination.
	   The Muslim statement Monday said, ``Especially disturbing is the
unanimity with which the Communist Party faction not only virtually
supported its member, but also started a discussion in support of
his extremist views.''
	   ``Russia can survive as a great country only through respect for
all'' peoples, the statement said.
	   The Communist-dominated Duma, the lower house of parliament,
refused to censure Makashov last week, and many members openly
offered support.
	   President Boris Yeltsin condemned the Communist Party on Friday
for its stance, and several prominent Russian liberals said the
government should consider banning the Communists.

	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ The Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC, wants to open an office in Brazil, like the ones
it already has in several other countries, a leader told a
Brazilian newspaper.
	   ``We want Brazil to get to know us better,'' FARC leader Hernan
Ramirez told the Jornal do Brasil newspaper. ``We want Brazil to
know that we are not linked to drug traffickers and that we're not
a band of kidnappers.''
	   He said his group already has offices in Venezuela, Mexico,
Argentina, Ecuador and Spain.
	   ``Over the past years we have been able establish a dialogue
with the Colombian government, thanks to the diplomatic initiatives
undertaken by countries with close tie to Colombia, Ramirez said.
``We want Brazil to take part in this process.''

Lawyers fear `the Jackal' may bring on his own end with fast
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ELAINE GANLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The man known as Carlos the Jackal refused food and
water for a sixth full day Monday to protest his treatment in
prison, and his lawyers claim he is rapidly weakening and mentally
preparing for death.
	   Having co-signed his will, the lawyers are alerting authorities
to a situation they fear could spell the end of Ilich Ramirez
Sanchez, once considered the world's most wanted terrorist.
	   The Venezuelan-born Ramirez has been held in solitary
confinement since being snared by French agents in Khartoum, Sudan,
on Aug. 15, 1994, then hauled to Paris in a sack.
	   He is serving a life term in La Sante prison for the 1975
murders of two French investigators and a Lebanese national, and is
under investigation for up to four terrorist attacks in France.
	   Neither the Justice Ministry, the Interior Ministry nor the
prison would comment Monday on the lawyers' claims.
	   The lawyers say Ramirez, 49, began fasting last Tuesday evening,
to protest being kept in solitary confinement and other conditions.
	   Nearly a week without food and water is taking its toll, they
say, on the man long portrayed as a fearless, swaggering terrorist,
linked to the 1975 seizure of OPEC ministers in Vienna and the 1976
hijacking of an Air France jet to Uganda.
	   ``He doesn't stand up very well. He has noise in his ears. His
face is gray,'' said Isabelle Coutant Peyre, one of Ramirez' four
defense lawyers.
	   She spoke after spending an hour with her client Monday. She
said his mouth was so dry he had difficulty speaking. She also said
he'd asked for cartons to pack up his belongings.
	   A prison medical exam found the 49-year-old portly prisoner has
lost 8 kilos (17.5 pounds), now weighing 82 kilos (181 pounds), the
lawyers said.
	   However, Ramirez was apparently well enough to write a letter _
dated Monday, written neatly in English _ to Iran's spiritual
leader, complaining about Yasser Arafat's performance in Mideast
peace talks. A copy of the letter was made available to The
Associated Press.
	   In a letter to President Jacques Chirac, attorney Francis
Vuillemin asked the president to intervene, removing Ramirez from
solitary confinement.
	   Ramirez ``is not a guinea pig on which one can experiment
endlessly on the capacity of resistance to the inhuman,'' the
letter said.
	   Yet another handwritten complaint, dated Friday and signed
``Carlos,'' demands an end to ``harassment'' of him and his
lawyers; notification when correspondence is seized; French lessons
and visitation rights.
	   The Venezuelan Embassy sent a letter to the French Foreign
Ministry asking that Ramirez's human rights be respected, according
to a ranking embassy official who asked not to be identified by
name.
	   Fasting has not stopped Ramirez from trying to make his voice
heard beyond his cell.
	   An ``open letter'' to Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Arafat
put in a ``pitiful performance'' in recent Mideast peace talks at
Wye Plantation.
	   ``I remain yours in Revolution,'' concluded the letter, signed
``Carlos.''

India beats Sri Lanka by 81 runs in Coca Cola Trophy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with India win, after Sri Lanka innings &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SHARJAH, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Paceman Ajit Agarkar and
left arm spinner Sunil Joshi picked up three wickets each to see
India thrash world champs Sri Lanka by 81 runs and comfortably
reach the final of the Coca Cola Trophy.
	   India, which recorded its third win in this three-nation
tournament, made a poor start becoming 179 all out. But their
agressive bowling dismissed Sri Lanka for an even poorer score of
98 in 39 overs, including a wicket of key batsman Sanath Jayasuriya
for duck.
	   The pace attack of Agarkar (3 for 35) and Joshi (3 for 17) and
Javagal Srinath (2 for 20) sliced through much of the tough Sri
Lankan top order.
	   Agarkar removed Avishka Gunawardena, Marvan Atapattu, and Roshan
Mahanama, to reduce Sri Lanka to 21 for 4 by the eight over.
	   Aravinda de Silva, lucky to survive an appeal caught behind by
Agarkar, tried his best to lift the Sri Lankan innings, but he too
perished after scoring only 26 off 67 balls.
	   De Silva was caught behind by an alert keeper, Nayan Mongia, in
the 21st over bowled by left arm spinner Joshi, putting Sri Lanka
at 7 for 66. Joshi had impressive figures of three for 17 in his 10
over spell.
	   De Silva's dismissal, after the successive outs of skipper
Arjuna Ranatunga (9) and Romesh Kaluwitharna (0), left Sri Lanka
sliding swiftly toward a defeat.
	   India has clearly made it to the final, while Sri Lanka will
play against Zimbabwe on Tuesday to decide the other finalist in
the dlrs 85,000 tournament, which ends on Nov. 13.
	   Earlier when India batted, Atapattu led a remarkable fielding
display to help Sri Lanka dismiss India for 179.
	   After losing their first two matches, the Sri Lankans, pepped by
a day's rest, fired India by sending half their team back to the
pavilion for just 88 runs in the 30 over.
	   Atapattu was the star of the field, running out Sauruv Ganguly
in the second over with a direct throw at the stumps, with India's
score at 1.
	   He then took successive catches to send back Nayan Mongia (3)
and a big wicket of ace batsman Sachin Tendulkar (18), off paceman
Pramodaya Wickremasinghe, playing his first match in the
competition.
	   Atapattu, who ran several meters (yards) to take Tendulkar's
catch, was not finished yet. He later snapped up seasoned Captain
Mohammed Azharuddin (26 off 46 balls) off spinner Thilan
Samaraweera in the 30th over and ended the innings by running out
Anil Kumble (12), the last man.
	   Another brilliant fielding came from Mahanama, who leaped in the
air with his arms spread out to take a catch at mid-off, which saw
batsman Nikhil Chopra off the field and give Kumara Dharmasena one
of his three wickets.
	   Ajay Jadeja, one of the three run out victims, anchored the
Indian innings with a fine 64, including a six and a boundary, off
174 balls.
	   Dharmasena, who failed to click in the previous matches, was the
pick of the bowlers, taking 3 for 31 from nine overs.
	   However, paceman Chaminda Vaas kept a tight leash on the Indian
batsman, conceding 12 runs from six overs and finished 1 from 37
from his spell of 10 overs.

Terrorist charged in Romania; open bank account found

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The international terrorist known as
``Carlos the Jackal'' was charged with crimes against humanity in
Romania, and an open bank account was found in his name, a military
prosecutor said Monday.
	   ``The network of Carlos' collaborators may still be active in
Romania,'' national television quoted Gen. Dan Voinea as saying.
	   The official did not specify how much money, if any, was in the
account.
	   Voinea announced that Romania charged Carlos, whose real name is
Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, of undermining the peace and committing
crimes against humanity. He did not say when the charges were
filed.
	   Prosecutors accused Ramirez of committing several terrorist acts
in France and Germany between 1977 and 1981, following orders of
Romania's Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
	   ``The German secret service told us Carlos rented a car in
Germany using false documents provided by Romania,'' Voinea said.
	   He added that Romania's communist-era secret services, the
Securitate and the Foreign Information Service, had files on
Ramirez which might be useful to the investigation.
	   ``But these files are still secret,'' said the military
prosecutor. He did not explain why the files cannot be accessed
now, nine years after the end of communism.
	   Ramirez is currently imprisoned in France, serving a life term
for shooting two French police investigators and a Lebanese man.
	   Romanian media reported early this year that Ramirez had been
employed by Ceausescu to blow up the Romanian Service of Radio Free
Europe in February 1981.
	   Nine people were injured in the attack on the Munich-based radio
program, which broadcast into communist Eastern Europe.
	   Ceausescu was apparently infuriated by Radio Free Europe's
anti-communist broadcasts and by the defection of his intelligence
service chief, Gen. Ion Pacepa, to the United States in 1978.
	   Ramirez found temporary shelter in Romania between 1980 and
1989.
	   Ceausescu was killed during the anti-communist revolt in 1989.
	   Ramirez, who was captured in Sudan in August 1994, is believed
responsible for the deaths of at least 83 people during his
terrorist career in Europe and the Middle East. He has been linked
to the 1975 seizure of OPEC oil ministers in Vienna and the 1976
hijacking of an Air France jet to Uganda.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _Italy's new premier assured the Turin Olympic
Committee on Monday that the government still supports the northern
city's bid for the 2006 games.
	   The financial, political and diplomatic support for Turin's
candidacy was in the best interests of the entire nation, Premier
Massimo D'Alema said.
	   D'Alema, who took office last month, is continuing the support
offered by the old premier, Romano Prodi.
	   Besides Turin, other contenders include Sion, Switzerland;
Zakopane, Poland; Helsinki, Finland; Klagenfurt, Austria; and
Slovakia's High Tatras Mountains. The 2006 host city will be

Shares rise on news of Ciba-Clariant merger
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS with developments, new details for AMs. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Two Swiss firms disclosed Monday that
they would merge to form the world's largest maker of specialty
chemicals and dyes in an effort to counter the global downturn that
has undermined their sales growth.
	   The announcement, about two years after their former parent
corporations joined to form chemicals giant Novartis, sent the
shares of the prospective partners, Ciba Specialty Chemicals and
Clariant, sharply higher.
	   About 3,000 of the companies' combined 55,000 jobs worldwide
will be lost. The fusion will cost 800 million Swiss francs (dlrs
572 million), but a saving of 600 million francs (dlrs 444 million)
per year is anticipated, a joint statement said.
	   The new company is to retain the name Clariant, which was given
to the spin off from the Swiss drug group Sandoz AG in the Novartis
creation. Rolf A. Meyer, Ciba Specialty chairman, said the merger
would cause the demise of the Ciba name, left over from the former
parent, Ciba-Geigy AG.
	   Meyer said it would have cost 200 million francs (dlrs 150
million) to retain rights to the name and that combined firm could
find better uses for the money.
	   Clariant merged with the special chemicals divison of the German
group Hoechst AG in 1996. Hoechst still owns 45 percent of
Clariant, but Clariant's chairman, Rolf W. Schweizer, said that
share would decline.
	   Schweizer will be chairman of the new company. Meyer will be
will be vice chairman and chief executive officer.
	   A joint statement said the merger will probably be completed in
the second half of next year after approval from authorities.
	   Specialty chemicals are used to enhance the durability,
performance, color and feel of materials used to produce clothes,
packaging, household appliances, automobiles and other industrial
and consumer goods.
	   The decision to go ahead with the merger comes just six weeks
after Meyer and Schweizer held their first talks on the subject,
Schweizer told a news conference.
	   The two companies' product portfolios had become increasingly
complementary and both face ``the same difficulties and
challenges,'' he added.
	   ``This makes excellent strategic sense with our complementary
portfolio of products and businesses and shared focus on sustained
operating performance,'' said Meyer.
	   Products will include additives and water treatments; cellulose
ethers; process chemicals; and fine chemicals and colors.
	   The merger, through a share swap, will leave Ciba shareholders
with 46 percent of the new company and Clariant shareholders with
54 percent.
	   Ciba and Clariant's former parent companies, Ciba-Geigy and
Sandoz, merged in 1996 to form Novartis, one of the world's largest
life sciences groups.
	   Shares in Ciba opened up 22.4 per cent on the previous Friday.
Shortly before Monday's close, the figure had settled at a six per
cent rise.

Soros says United States opposes international cooperation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ U.S. billionaire financier George Soros
chided Monday his government for obstructing international
cooperation by refusing to support setting up an international
criminal court.
	   ``The United States is the greatest opponent of international
cooperation,'' said Soros, who is Hungarian-born, during a lecture
in the Bulgarian capital.
	   ``The U.S., China, Israel, Yemen and Iraq voted against the
international criminal court. It's a very good company,'' he added.
``The United States has to reconsider its policy to international
cooperation.''
	   Soros runs a pro-democracy fund named ``Open Society,'' which
advocates acceptance of universal values of free market and
democracy across the world. The fund supports developmet of
western-style civil societies in the emerging democracies of the
former Soviet bloc.
	   ``Open society can be endangered by an excessive reliance on
market ... by the belief that markets can take care of everything.
I think that it is a false idea,'' he said.
	   Soros said unpredictability of global fiancial markets was at
the core of the Asian economic meltdown. ``Financial markets are
inherently unstable and instability can cause a tremendous
damage,'' he said.
	   Soros added there was ``a moral hazard'' in tackling the world
financial crisis by lowering interest rates in the United States
and raising them in Asian economies.
	   ``There is an asymmetry in the treatment of debtors and
creditors which is described as a moral hazard...This will have to
be corrected,'' he said.
	   He also dismissed calls to abolish the International Monetary
Fund, but said it needed to be reformed.
	   ``The IMF has been more interested in saving the global banking
system than the countries which have been in trouble,'' Soros said.

	   LONDON (AP) _ A settlement appeared to have been reached Monday
to allow the West Indies cricket tour of South Africa to go ahead.
	   Courtney Walsh, head of the West Indies players association,
said the players were packed and ready to board a flight Monday
night to South Africa.
	   Walsh said he was expecting an official announcement shortly.
	   A switchboard operator at the hotel near Heathrow Airport where
the West Indies players have been staying said most of the team had
already checked out.
	   The first West Indies tour of South Africa since the end of
apartheid has been in danger of being canceled in a dispute over
pay and conditions.
	   Earlier Monday, South Africa's cricket board was forced to call
off the first match of the tour _ Tuesday's warmup between the West
Indies and an amateur 11 in Randjiesfontein, near Johannesburg.
	   The opening match now would now be in Soweto on Wednesday
against a Gauteng provincial 11.
	   The opening first-class match of the tour is due to start
Saturday against Griqualand and West. The first Test is set for
Nov. 26.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian aircraft officials flew to Iran on Monday
to finalize a deal for building a new Tupolev passenger plane in
Iran, a news agency reported.
	   Russia's Tupolev design bureau will roll out the first 100-seat
Tu-334 in late November or early December.
	   The chairman of Iran's parliament, Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, signed
an agreement in Russia last year on building the airliners in Iran.
	   The Russian delegation went to Iran on Monday to work out
licensing arrangements, the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted Tupolev
officials as saying.
	   The plane is expected to cost dlrs 14 million to dlrs 15
million, ITAR-Tass said. It was designed to replace the aging fleet
of Tu-134 planes, and will be able to fly up to 2,000 kilometers
(1,200 miles).

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico's ruling party appeared Monday to have
scored strong weekend victories in two state gubernatorial
elections. But for the second time this year, party infighting
appears to have cost it a governorship.
	   The Institutional Revolutionary Party, the longest-ruling party
in the Western hemisphere, had 51 percent of the vote in the
central state of Puebla and the conservative National Action Party
had 39 percent with 40 percent of the vote counted.
	   In northwestern state of Sinaloa, with 51 percent of the vote
counted, the ruling party led National Action 47 to 31 percent.
National Action state chairman Rafael Morgan Rios said he would
seek to annul the election because of alleged irregularities. ``We
do not accept defeat,'' he said late Sunday.
	   But the ruling party, known as the PRI, appeared to have lost
the small central state of Tlaxcala to a man who had been one of
its own stalwarts until he was asked to lead a coalition dominated
by the leftist Democratic Revolution Party.
	   With 80 percent of votes counted, coalition candidate Alfonso
Sanchez Anaya had 46.5 percent of the vote to 42 percent for
Joaquin Cisneros of the PRI.
	   It was the second time this year that the PRI has lost a state
to a candidate who had bolted the party after being passed over for
its gubernatorial nomination.
	   Sanchez, a 38-year veteran of the party and nephew of former
Gov. Emilio Sanchez Piedras, quit the PRI in April, charging that
party leaders were trying to prevent him from gaining the
nomination.
	   In July, the PRI lost the governorship of Zacatecas state to
Democratic Revolution's Ricardo Monreal, a PRI senator who quit the
party in anger at being passed over for his own party's nomination.
	   Both states were traditional PRI strongholds.
	   The PRI now appears to have won seven of 10 gubernatorial
elections this year _ giving it momentum toward presidential
elections in 2000.
	   ``How could the party of Raul Salinas obtain such positive
results?'' said political scientist Sergio Aguayo at the elite
Colegio de Mexico, referring to scandals involving the brother of a
former PRI president, Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
	   ``The elections suggests voters are very irritated at the
opposition's inability to help solve the nation's problems,''
	   Sunday's results may also help three men widely seen as possible
presidential candidates.
	   Strong PRI showings in Puebla and Sinaloa could boost the
presidential prospects of outgoing Puebla Gov. Manuel Bartlett and
Interior Minister Francisco Labastida, a former Sinaloa governor.
	   A possible PRD victory in Tlaxcala would help bolster Mexico
City Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas' bid for a third presidential
nomination. Cardenas himself quit the PRI in 1988.
	   The PRI's future had been in doubt following several
gubernatorial losses and its failure to win a majority of Congress
for the first time in the 1997 mid-term elections.
	   ``There were doubts early in the year about the PRI's ability to
win elections. Now it is adapting to a more competitive elections
system in Mexico,'' said Armand Peschard, an analyst with the
Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.

leading rabbi &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ For the first time in two millennia, Jews around
the world are free from official persecution, Britain's former
chief rabbi said Monday.
	   Marking the 60th anniversary of Kristallnacht _ when Nazis
rampaged through Germany, arresting or killing Jews and destroying
their property _ Lord Jakobovitz said Jewish fortunes ''have
altogether been reversed'' in the years since the Holocaust.
	   ``For the first time in over 2,000 years of the Jewish
experience, there is not a single Jewish community anywhere in the
world where Jews are officially persecuted because they are Jews,''
he told a gathering of Jews at Westminster Central Hall.
	   ``On the contrary, we have gained recognition and esteem to the
extent to which we cultivate our heritage and pursue our historical
assignment,'' he said.
	   ``Maybe we are not sufficiently aware of this unmatched change
in the Jewish experience,'' Jakobovitz told the meeting, organized
by the Board of Deputies of British Jews.

British doping expert recommends blood tests for Sydney Olympics
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ A top British expert on
performance-enhancing drugs is recommending that athletes' blood,
as well as urine, be tested at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney.
	   ``By 2000, unless we are testing with blood, we haven't got a
chance,'' Dr. David Cowan, director of the Drug Control Center at
Kings College London, was quoted as saying in Monday's Irish
Independent newspaper.
	   Speaking at a weekend Dublin conference on doping in
international sports, Cowan emphasized that urine testing failed to
detect abuse of the endurance-building drug EPO and human growth
hormone, or HGH.
	   But Dr. Wade Exum, director of the U.S. Olympic Committee's Drug
Control Administration, told the same symposium of international
experts that blood testing would be unnecessarily ``invasive'' and
no more effective.
	   ``Why spend millions of dollars opening up a whole new area of
research when, in fact, that money could be used to perfect
urinalysis?'' Exum was quoted as saying.
	   ``Of course HGH and EPO can be detected in urine,'' he said.
``It is a physiological fact that anything which is in the body
system passes through the kidneys and appears in urine.''
	   The International Olympic Committee says it will introduce blood
tests only if they are 100 percent foolproof.

Israel to delay West Bank withdrawal despite U.S. pressure

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS Top &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ One week after the Mideast peace accord
was to take effect, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ignored U.S.
pressure to stick to the timetable Monday and said he would not go
forward until the Palestinians combat militants.
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, said Israel will
also likely miss the land-for-security agreement's Nov. 16
withdrawal date, when Israeli troops are to begin a phased pullout
from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   ``There will be a few days' delay, I presume,'' Bar-Illan said.
	   Already, the accord has fallen one week behind schedule. The
deal, which is to be implemented over 12-weeks, was to have taken
effect Monday, Nov. 2, but has been held up by Israel over
clarification on Palestinian obligations under the accord. After a
suicide bombing in a Jerusalem market on Friday, Israel's Cabinet
suspended indefinitely debate over the agreement until the
Palestinians do more to fight Islamic militant groups.

Shares rise on news of Ciba-Clariant merger
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS with new details thruout. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Two Swiss firms disclosed Monday that
they would merge to form the world's largest maker of specialty
chemicals and dyes in an effort to counter the global downturn that
has undermined their sales growth.
	   The announcement, about two years after their former parent
corporations joined to form chemicals giant Novartis, sent the
shares of the prospective partners, Ciba Specialty Chemicals and
Clariant, sharply higher.
	   About 3,000 of the companies' combined 55,000 jobs worldwide
will be lost. The fusion will cost 800 million Swiss francs (dlrs
572 million), but a saving of 600 million francs (dlrs 444 million)
a year is anticipated, a joint statement said.
	   The new company is to retain the name Clariant, which was given
to the spinoff from the Swiss drug group Sandoz AG in the Novartis
creation. Rolf A. Meyer, Ciba Specialty chairman, said the merger
would cause the demise of the Ciba name, left over from the former
parent, Ciba-Geigy AG.
	   Meyer said it would have cost 200 million francs (dlrs 150
million) to retain rights to the name and that combined firm could
find better uses for the money.
	   Clariant merged with the special chemicals division of the
German group Hoechst AG in 1996. Hoechst still owns 45 percent of
Clariant, but Clariant's chairman, Rolf W. Schweizer, said that
share would decline.
	   Schweizer will be chairman of the new company. Meyer will be
vice chairman and chief executive officer.
	   A joint statement said the merger will probably be completed in
the second half of next year after approval from authorities.
	   Specialty chemicals are used to enhance the durability,
performance, color and feel of materials used to produce clothes,
packaging, household appliances, automobiles and other industrial
and consumer goods.
	   The decision to go ahead with the merger comes just six weeks
after Meyer and Schweizer held their first talks on the subject,
Schweizer told a news conference.
	   The two companies' product portfolios had become increasingly
complementary and both face ``the same difficulties and
challenges,'' he added.
	   ``This makes excellent strategic sense with our complementary
portfolio of products and businesses and shared focus on sustained
operating performance,'' said Meyer.
	   Products will include additives and water treatments; cellulose
ethers; process chemicals; and fine chemicals and colors.
	   The merger, through a share swap, will leave Ciba shareholders
with 46 percent of the new company and Clariant shareholders with
54 percent.
	   Ciba and Clariant's former parent companies, Ciba-Geigy and
Sandoz, merged in 1996 to form Novartis, one of the world's largest
life sciences groups.

Reformers criticize Russia's economic plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in new grafs 7-8 with EU offer of food aid. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A leading Russian reformer warned Monday that the
government's economic bailout plan will only deepen its troubles,
while another reformer blamed the International Monetary Fund for
aggravating the crisis.
	   Yegor Gaidar, a former prime minister who launched Russia's
first post-Soviet economic reforms, said that under the
government's plan, ``Russia's economic policies will be weak and
their results will be unfavorable. The crisis will be deepening.''
	   Gaidar, speaking at a conference in Kiev called by a top
Ukrainian reformer, Viktor Pynzenyk, blamed Russia's recent
foot-dragging on reforms for the current crisis.
	   Boris Nemtsov, a former Russian deputy prime minister also at
Monday's conference, said the IMF was partly to blame because it
``was trying to impose a program that the (Russian) government did
not want to implement.''
	   Nemtsov was fired along with the rest of the Russian government
in August after it stopped propping up the ruble and froze dlrs 40
billion in treasury bill debts, sending the economy into turmoil.
	   ``I think it is absolutely incorrect when IMF experts start
imposing their liberal requirements on governments, because these
requirements are impossible to implement from the very start,''
Nemtsov said.
	   Russia's economic problems have prompted fears of food shortages
_ or at least serious problems in distributing food to the
far-flung reaches of the world's largest country.
	   In Brussels, Belgium, European Union foreign ministers were
cobbling together plans Monday to grant Russia dlrs 480 million in
food aid. The United States offered Russia food aid worth dlrs 625
million on Friday.
	   Also Monday, Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov was quoted by The
Wall Street Journal as saying Russia would pay off the frozen
treasury bills with new ruble-denominated bonds and a small amount
of ruble cash.
	   Foreign creditors reached an agreement in London on Friday with
Russian officials on restructuring the debt. Zadornov said Russia
offered to pay 10 percent of the debt in cash and the rest in
bonds.
	   Foreign investors, who hold nearly one-third of the frozen debt,
have said they agreed to accept some ruble-denominated bonds.
	   Zadornov did not say, however, what exchange rate would be
applied to the new bonds, which is crucial because of the ruble's
volatility.
	   The ruble was hovering around 6 to the dollar until the August
devaluation, then plunged as low as 20 to the dollar. It has
recently stabilized at about 15 to the dollar.

Catholic soccer club votes to play against police team
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Taking another step towards
reconciliation in Northern Ireland, a Catholic-supported soccer
club has voted to play the team organized by the Royal Ulster
Constabulary, the province's Protestant-dominated police force.
	   The decision by organizers of the Donegal Celtic club _ taken in
secret Sunday on a 61 percent ``yes'' vote _ flew in the face of
decades of Catholic opposition to the police force. Soccer teams
based in Catholic areas have previously withdrawn from any
scheduled contests with the RUC team.
	   Donegal Celtic, an ambitious amateur club based in the heart of
Catholic west Belfast, had come under intense pressure from Sinn
Fein, the dominant political party in the area, not to play the RUC
club Saturday in a semifinal for a Northern Ireland-wide tournment.
	   Sinn Fein has urged Catholics to have no contact with police as
part of the party's campaign to have the force disbanded.
Reflecting those hostile realities, police today patrol Catholic
west Belfast in armored cars and flak jackets despite April's peace
accord.
	   Sinn Fein activists had successfully pressed Donegal Celtic to
forfeit a 1996 contest with the RUC team, and got the club's
organizers to postpone their decision this time by rallying
protesters at their regular meeting last month.
	   ``Donegal Celtic are lending credibility to RUC murderers,''
said local Sinn Fein councilman Gerard O'Neill, who hoped that
Sunday's decision might yet be overturned with protests.
	   But Alex McGreevy, a former Donegal Celtic player, said the
club's organizers weren't willing to forfeit its competitive edge
in favor of scoring a negative political point that he said
``should have nothing to do with soccer.''
	   A Donegal Celtic committee member, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said members and players had been phoned over the over
weekend at their homes by Sinn Fein activists warning them not to
sanction the game.
	   Donegal Celtic also announced it plans to donate its share of
profits from Saturday's game to a Catholic couple who had their
three young boys burned to death in a July arson attack committed
by Protestant extremists.

Opposition says new draft constitution destroys the nation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with European Union urging opposition not to boycott
referendum; ADDS byline. &QL; 
 &UR; BY MERITA DHIMGJOKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ The opposition led by former President
Sali Berisha charged Monday that the new constitution due to be
voted on later this month destroys the Albanian nation by allowing
people to change their nationality and religion.
	   Those two envisaged freedoms likely are the most controversial
issues that recently have sharpened the dispute between the
Socialist-led governing coalition and the opposition.
	   A statement issued by the opposition Democratic Party Monday
said these articles allow ``the legalization of the process of
massive changes in Albanian nationality... a quiet and soft ethnic
cleansing , not through massacres, hunger or diseases but through
visas, baptisms, money and jobs...''
	   Despite the international community's support for the
constitution, the Democrats and their allies have declared they
will boycott the Nov. 22 referendum.
	   In a communique released in Vienna, Austria, the European Union
urged the Albanian opposition again on Monday not to boycott the
referendum. A boycott is no constructive instrument of democracy,
said EU Council Chairman Wolfgang Schuessel, the Austrian foreign
minister.
	   However. the opposition statement released in Tirana said, ``The
Democratic Party calls on Albanians not to not show up for the
referendum ... as it destroys the Albanian nationality.''
	   The opposition also has boycotted parliament and refused to
participate in the process of drafting of the constitution.
	   Several other European institutions, such as the Council of
Europe and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,
already have criticized the envisaged boycott and have suggested
that it leads to the opposition's self-isolation.
	   The opposition expressed fear that under the new constitution
many Albanians might decide to declare themselves being of a
non-Albanian _ mostly of Greek _ nationality for economic reasons.
	   Most Muslim Albanians working in Greece have changed their names
into Orthodox ones, hoping for better treatement and jobs.
	   During Berisha's rule, municipalities imposed restrictions on
those who were allowed to change their names.
	   In the name of the European Union, Schuessel welcomed the work
done so far by the Albanian parliamentary constitution, saying that
``serious efforts have been made in order to ensure the broadest
possible participation of all political parties.''
	   He said the EU consider the constitution a ``substantial
obligation to forge ahead and consolidate democracy and stability
in Albania.''

Lufthansa flight to Israel diverted after Israeli officials deny
</HEADLINE>
some passengers entry &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Lufthansa airline on Monday confirmed
a flight to Israel had been diverted to Istanbul, Turkey after
Israeli officials informed the airline they would not permit entry
to some passengers on board.
	   Lufthansa spokesman Markus Ruediger, declined to identify the
passengers, but said ``we had to divert the flight to Istanbul.''
	   ``This action became necessary after we at Lufthansa received
information that there were passengers on board that would not be
allowed to enter the state of Israel.''
	   Consequently, Lufthansa management decided to ``divert the
aircraft to the nearest possible location, which at that time was
Istanbul,'' Ruediger said.
	   ``The passengers in question are now in a hotel in Istanbul and
will return to Frankfurt tomorrow morning,'' Ruediger said. He said
the remaining passengers were now back on the plane and are
expected to arrive in Tel Aviv tonight.
	   Earlier Monday, Israeli radio reported that a group of right
wing extremists Germans on a Lufthansa flight bound for Israel,
were forced to land in Istanbul because the Israeli's wouldn't give
them entry visas.
	   In Israel, foreign ministry spokesman Aviv Shiron said the man
denied entry was Werner-Joachim Siegerist.
	   Siegerist, 51, heads the Hamburg-based extreme right ``Die
Deutschen Konservativen.''
	   He was sentenced to 18 months in prison in 1995 for incitement
to racial hatred because of a mass mailing describing gypsies as a
``criminal bunch.'' The sentenced was reduced to probation after he
appealed.
	   He once appealed for funds for his organization in an ad
commemorating Hitler's deputy Rudolf Hess.
	   Siegerist has dual German-Latvian citizenship and has also been
active in Latvian politics.

U.S. envoy sees bodies of two slain Serb policemen

<TEXT>
	   MALISEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A visiting U.S. war crimes envoy saw
first-hand evidence Monday of the ongoing violence in Kosovo _ the
apparently executed bodies of two Serb policemen.
	   Angry Serb police threatened to beef up their patrols in
response to the killings.
	   David Scheffer, the roving U.S. ambassador on war crimes issues,
viewed the bodies in this devastated central village as he toured
the area with the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission, or KDOM.
	   ``This represents one of the problems that is being experienced
here with the cease-fire, and that is that there are violations of
the cease fire by both sides,'' Scheffer said.
	   The policemen _ Ilija Vujosevic and Dejan Djatlov _ disappeared
Friday, the same day Serb police shot to death five ethnic Albanian
guerrillas, including a commander of two divisions.
	   Both of the slain policemen had gunshot wounds to the head,
indicating they had been killed execution-style. Serb police
spokesman Bozidar Filic said the executions showed the Kosovo
Liberation Army's utter disregard for the U.S.-sponsored
cease-fire.
	   He warned that unless ```international representatives'' secure
two main roads running through Malisevo by Wednesday, police will
increase their patrols and ``allow safe passage'' _ indicating a
possible new Serb action.
	   Serb authorities suspect the killed policemen were kidnapped by
the KLA in retaliation for the shootings of the five guerrillas.
	   The rebels say police shot at the five as they drove in two
vehicles from Opterusa village, while police claim the guerrillas
opened fire first.
	   Qamil Hajrizi, the father of one of the slain guerrillas, said
Monday that his son's body was riddled with bullets.
	   ``From what I saw, they were certainly ambushed,'' he said after
waiting about four hours to collect the body from a hospital morgue
in the southern city of Prizren. ``He was destroyed by many, many
bullets.''
	   A KLA official called the killing of the five guerrillas an
ambush that violated a de facto cease-fire in Kosovo. Under a
four-week-old agreement between Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, Milosevic's forces were
supposed to cease hostilities.
	   Violence by both sides has increased in the past week, including
at least three incidents in which police reported killing KLA
fighters who shot at them first.
	   Dozens of Serb police were killed before and after the start of
a Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists last February in
Kosovo, a majority Albanian province. Several hundred other people,
mostly ethnic Albanians, have been killed, and as many as 300,000
driven from their homes.
	   More than 50,000 refugees who had been living in the open have
come down from the hills into villages, though many cannot return
home due to the damage to their houses or fear of a continued Serb
police presence. With the first coating of snow arriving this week
in southern mountains, relief officials remain worried that some
refugees could still face exposure to harsher winter weather
expected soon.
	   Scheffer's one-day visit comes amid a continuing controversy
over the failure of Yugoslav authorities to cooperate with the
United Nations war crimes panel trying to investigate allegations
of atrocities in Kosovo.
	   Louise Arbour, chief prosecutor for the International War Crimes
Tribunal, and a team of investigators planned a weeklong mission in
Kosovo but were refused access to the province.
	   Arbour and Scheffer have threatened Yugoslavia with U.N.
sanctions if they don't get unlimited access.
	   ``There's no question that any visual observation of this area
of Kosovo reveals what appear to be war crimes,'' Scheffer said
Monday.

India beats Sri Lanka by 81 runs in Coca Cola Trophy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING for all needing &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with India win, after Sri Lanka innings &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SHARJAH, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Paceman Ajit Agarkar and
left arm spinner Sunil Joshi picked up three wickets each to see
India thrash world champs Sri Lanka by 81 runs and comfortably
reach the final of the Coca Cola Trophy.
	   India, which recorded its third win in this three-nation
tournament, made a poor start becoming 179 all out. But their
agressive bowling dismissed Sri Lanka for an even poorer score of
98 in 39 overs, including a wicket of key batsman Sanath Jayasuriya
for duck.
	   The pace attack of Agarkar (3 for 35) and Joshi (3 for 17) and
Javagal Srinath (2 for 20) sliced through much of the tough Sri
Lankan top order.
	   Agarkar removed Avishka Gunawardena, Marvan Atapattu, and Roshan
Mahanama, to reduce Sri Lanka to 21 for 4 by the eight over.
	   Aravinda de Silva, lucky to survive an appeal caught behind by
Agarkar, tried his best to lift the Sri Lankan innings, but he too
perished after scoring only 26 off 67 balls.
	   De Silva was caught behind by an alert keeper, Nayan Mongia, in
the 21st over bowled by left arm spinner Joshi, putting Sri Lanka
at 7 for 66. Joshi had impressive figures of three for 17 in his 10
over spell.
	   De Silva's dismissal, after the successive outs of skipper
Arjuna Ranatunga (9) and Romesh Kaluwitharna (0), left Sri Lanka
sliding swiftly toward a defeat.
	   India has clearly made it to the final, while Sri Lanka will
play against Zimbabwe on Tuesday to decide the other finalist in
the dlrs 85,000 tournament, which ends on Nov. 13.
	   Earlier when India batted, Atapattu led a remarkable fielding
display to help Sri Lanka dismiss India for 179.
	   After losing their first two matches, the Sri Lankans, pepped by
a day's rest, fired India by sending half their team back to the
pavilion for just 88 runs in the 30 over.
	   Atapattu was the star of the field, running out Sauruv Ganguly
in the second over with a direct throw at the stumps, with India's
score at 1.
	   He then took successive catches to send back Nayan Mongia (3)
and a big wicket of ace batsman Sachin Tendulkar (18), off paceman
Pramodaya Wickremasinghe, playing his first match in the
competition.
	   Atapattu, who ran several meters (yards) to take Tendulkar's
catch, was not finished yet. He later snapped up seasoned Captain
Mohammed Azharuddin (26 off 46 balls) off spinner Thilan
Samaraweera in the 30th over and ended the innings by running out
Anil Kumble (12), the last man.
	   Another brilliant fielding came from Mahanama, who leaped in the
air with his arms spread out to take a catch at mid-off, which saw
batsman Nikhil Chopra off the field and give Kumara Dharmasena one
of his three wickets.
	   Ajay Jadeja, one of the three run out victims, anchored the
Indian innings with a fine 64, including a six and a boundary, off
174 balls.
	   Dharmasena, who failed to click in the previous matches, was the
pick of the bowlers, taking 3 for 31 from nine overs.
	   However, paceman Chaminda Vaas kept a tight leash on the Indian
batsman, conceding 12 runs from six overs and finished 1 from 37
from his spell of 10 overs.

U.S. House committee chairman: Clinton should be 'called to

 &UR; By LAURIE KELLMAN &QC;

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Judiciary Committee Republicans renewed their
commitment to forge ahead with their inquiry of President Bill
Clinton as they bandied with scholars about what constitutes an
impeachable offense.
	   ``I really believe that notion that no man is above the law,''
committee Chairman Henry Hyde said Monday.
	   Rep. Charles Canady, chairman of subcommittee on the
Constitution, opened the hearing, a warm-up for next week's
impeachment proceedings, with a sharply worded attack on Clinton.
He rejected arguments that conduct in a private lawsuit can't be
grounds for impeachment.
	   The impeachment inquiry focuses on Clinton's admitted sexual
liaisons with White House intern Monica Lewinsky and allegations
that he lied about the relationship in the sexual harassment case
brought by Paula Jones.
	   ``If it remains unrebutted ... the evidence before us clearly
supports the conclusion that the president is guilty of multiple
acts of lying under oath, obstruction of justice and other
offenses,'' Canady charged.
	   ``He must be called to account for putting his selfish personal
interest ahead of his oath of office and his constitutional duty,''
he added.
	   Elsewhere, the Supreme Court issued two rulings unfavorable to
Clinton. One accepted a lower court decision that his lawyers must
answer questions from an investigative jury about possible criminal
conduct. The other says Secret Service agents can be questioned
about government officials they protect.
	   Hyde said the president has ``a peculiar and unique
responsibility'' to uphold the rule of law, and he expressed
frustration with those who would excuse lying under oath if it was
only about the president's personal life.
	   ``All of the sophistries that I hear, rationales,
justifications, 'everybody does it,' 'it was just about sex,' _
it's perjury,'' Hyde said.
	   The White House, meanwhile, said the Republican leadership
struggle in the House could have an impact on the impeachment
inquiry. Polls have shown a majority of voters want Clinton to
remain in office.
	   ``It could create a better environment for finishing up
something that the country so much wants to get behind it,''
presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart said. However, he said,
``What's worrying is that somehow in the battle for votes, that
commitments may be made that wouldn't be in the best interests of
putting this behind us.''
	   But at the subcommittee hearing, Hyde said, ``We paid attention
to the polls and the elections, but I'm not letting that influence
my intention or desire to proceed with what I think is our
constitutional duty.''
	   House Democrats continued their attacks on Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr, whose allegations prompted the impeachment inquiry.
Rep. John Conyers, the senior Democrat on the full Judiciary
Committee, said Starr's inquiry was based an ``authoritarian,
privacy-invading questions about sex.''
	   ``There is no crime of perjury arising out of questions the
government doesn't have the legal authority to ask,'' Conyers said.
	   The scholarly debate featured testimony from 19 academicians.
	   At issue is whether Clinton's efforts to conceal his affair with
Monica Lewinsky from the Jones lawsuit and the public warrant his
removal from office. The founders said Congress has the authority
to impeach a president for treason, bribery or ``other high crimes
and misdemeanors,'' a definition they deliberately left vague.
	   ``The word 'other' suggests we need acts of the same magnitude
and the same nature as treason or bribery,'' said University of
Chicago law professor Cass Sunstein. ``This case is not close to
the line.''
	   University of London professor Gary McDowell countered that
crimes such as obstructing the legal process and perjury would
``would have been understood by the founders as constituting high
crimes and misdemeanors.''
	   ``Censure would be the coward's way out,'' he added.

Israel to delay West Bank withdrawal despite U.S. pressure
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to RAISE Israel to miss deadline for withdrawal. &QL; 
 &UR; With Israel-Settlers &QL; 
 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Israel likely will miss the new Mideast
peace accord's Nov. 16 date for beginning a phased withdrawal of
its soldiers from 13 percent of the West Bank, a key adviser to the
prime minister said Monday.
	   The peace accord was to have taken effect Nov. 2 and be
implemented over 12 weeks. It has been held up by Israel, which
seeks to clarify the Palestinians' obligations. After a suicide
bombing in Jerusalem on Friday, Israel's Cabinet suspended debate
on the deal until the Palestinians do more to fight Islamic
militants.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's senior adviser, David
Bar-Illan, said Monday that Israel likely will not begin
withdrawing from the West Bank on schedule.
	   ``There will be a few days' delay, I presume,'' he said.
	   ``We would like to proceed with the agreement as soon as we have
assurances that the spate of terrorist bombings have been taken
care of by systematic comprehensive action by the Palestinians,''
Netanyahu said.
	   The Palestinians said they are carrying out their commitments
and said Israel is using the security issue as a stall tactic.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said the agreement is ``as
good as dead'' if Israel refuses to carry out the withdrawals on
time. ``He (Netanyahu) cannot expect to have implementation of one
part of the agreement, our commitments, and postpone the other
part,'' he said.
	   Israel and the United States appeared to be at odds over three
key issues is the accord _ the timetable, continued Jewish
settlement expansion and the procedure for revoking provisions in
the PLO founding charter calling for Israel's destruction.
	   U.S. Embassy spokesman Larry Schwartz said that in a telephone
call last week, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told
Netanyahu that she expected Israel to implement the agreement on
time.
	   ``Our understanding is that the Wye timetable will not slip,''
Schwartz told The Associated Press. ``The timetable is meant to
continue as it was signed.''

Poland expects smooth start of EU membership negotiations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Polish officials said Monday they expect a
smooth start to negotiations on joining the European Union, which
open in the EU headquarters in Brussels on Tuesday.
	   Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek, and Poland's chief negotiator Jan
Kulakowski said Poland has chosen for the start seven subjects,
ranging from education to security policy, that aren't likely to
arouse much controversy.
	   ``These are the easiest areas. We realize that,'' Buzek said at
a news conference on Poland's negotiating platform.
	   On Tuesday, Poland and five other countries begin membership
talks with the 15 foreign ministers of the European Union, with the
EU's executive body, the European Commission, and with the
government of Austria, which presently holds the rotating EU
presidency. The other countries are Estonia, the Czech Republic,
Slovenia, Hungary and Cyprus.
	   Kulakowski, who reports directly to Buzek, said that
non-controversial subjects were chosen deliberately to create
momentum for Poland's drive to be ready for EU membership by Dec.
31, 2002.
	   Other easy areas cover foreign policy, scientific research,
industrial policy, culture and media and small business, he said.
	   Poland will ask for a transitory period of unspecified duration
in telecommunications to gain time for the armed forces to turn
over certain frequencies to private cellular telephone operators.
	   One of areas expected to cause the most trouble, Poland's huge
and backward agricultural sector, won't be among the first to be
taken up at the negotiating table.
	   The reason for that, though, is that the EU itself must first
adopt Agenda 2000, its plan for the reform of its cumbersome and
costly system of farm subsidies, Kulakowski noted.
	   He said that talks on the first seven areas should be concluded
in the first half of next year.
	   Meanwhile, Poland will prepare and present in December its
negotiating positions on several further areas, including the
single market, statistics and consumer protection.

Israel to delay West Bank withdrawal despite U.S. pressure
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with State Department comment, ADDS detail from accord
grafs 8-9 &QL; 
 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ One week after the Mideast peace accord
was to take effect, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ignored U.S.
pressure to stick to the timetable Monday and said he would not go
forward until the Palestinians combat militants.
	   Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, said Israel will
also likely miss the land-for-security agreement's Nov. 16
withdrawal date, when Israeli troops are to begin a phased pullout
from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   ``There will be a few days' delay, I presume,'' Bar-Illan said.
	   Already, the accord has fallen one week behind schedule. The
deal, which is to be implemented over 12-weeks, was to have taken
effect Monday, Nov. 2, but has been held up by Israel over
clarification on Palestinian obligations under the accord. After a
suicide bombing in a Jerusalem market on Friday, Israel's Cabinet
suspended indefinitely debate over the agreement until the
Palestinians do more to fight Islamic militant groups.
	   ``We would like to proceed with the agreement as soon as we have
assurances that the spate of terrorist bombings have been taken
care of by systematic comprehensive action by the Palestinians,''
Netanyahu said.
	   But the Palestinians said they are carrying out their
commitments and said Israel is using the security issue as a stall
tactic.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said the agreement is ``as
good as dead'' if Israel refuses to carry out the withdrawals on
time. ``He (Netanyahu) cannot expect to have implementation of one
part of the agreement, our commitments, and postpone the other
part,'' he said.
	   The Palestinians have kept to the timetable by submitting an
action plan to fight Islamic militants and have resumed security
cooperation with Israel. However, because Israel's Cabinet has not
ratified the accord, the sides missed the Monday date set to reach
agreement on a land route for Palestinians linking the southern
West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James Rubin said ``We
believe it is important that the Israeli government resume the
political-legal process soon and carry out its responsibilities
under the terms of the Wye memorandum.''
	   Israel and the United States appeared to be at odds over three
key issues is the accord _ the time table, continued Jewish
settlement expansion and the procedure for revoking provisions in
the PLO founding charter calling for Israel's destruction.
	   U.S. embassy spokesman Larry Schwartz said that in a phone call
last week, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told
Netanyahu that she expected Israel to implement the agreement on
time.
	   ``Our understanding is that the Wye timetable will not slip,''
Schwartz told The Associated Press. ``The timetable is meant to
continue as it was signed.''

Polish postal workers to get free shares in privatized
</HEADLINE>
telecommunication &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The Polish parliament on Monday
overwhelmingly decided that postal workers should get free shares
in the country's biggest privatization so-far, of the state-owned
telecommunication monopoly.
	   The 460-member lower house, or Sejm, voted 362-5 with five
abstentions to approve a government project and make Poczta Polska
employees eligible for free shares of Telekomunikacja Polska SA.
The two companies were separated in 1991 as part of restructuring.
	   The bill still needs to be approved by the upper house and by
President Aleksander Kwasniewski.
	   In September, TPSA employees threatened a strike if postal
workers were to get free shares. It will increase the number of
eligible employees from 75,000 to 180,000 and cut down by more than
a half the original estimates of getting 60,000 zloty (dlrs 16,200)
worth of free shares per person.
	   Average monthly salary in Poland is about dlrs 300.
	   TPSA, which has 8 million subscribers, is practically a monopoly
in this nation of 39 million.
	   Proceeds from the sale of Telekomunikacja Polska SA, valued by
analysts at more than dlrs 8 billion, will be used to cover budget
deficits, reform of the social security system and further
privatization.
	   Starting Oct. 19, the government is selling 15 to 25 percent of
the telephone company's shares beginning with a volume that could
double shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange and make it the largest
exchange in central Europe.
	   Fifteen percent will be distributed to employees free of charge.
	   TPSA earned a net profit of 970 million zloty (dlrs 262 million)
last year.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Caribbean news agency report in grafs 6-7; edits
 &UR; West Indies tour of South Africa apparently on
 &UR; By JOHN PYE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A settlement appeared to have been reached Monday
to allow the West Indies cricket tour of South Africa to go ahead.
	   Courtney Walsh, head of the West Indies players association,
said the players were packed and ready to board a flight Monday
night to South Africa.
	   Walsh, the former team captain, said he was expecting an
official announcement shortly.
	   A switchboard operator at the hotel near Heathrow Airport where
the West Indies players have been staying said most of the team had
already checked out.
	   There was speculation the players would make the day's last
flight from Heathrow to South Africa, scheduled for 9:45 p.m. (2145
GMT).
	   The Caribbean News Agency quoted Walsh as saying that Brian Lara
and Carl Hooper have been reinstated as captain and vice captain of
the team _ a key demand of the striking players.
	   The agency quoted Walsh as saying the original team was going to
South Africa and was packing as he spoke.
	   The first West Indies tour of South Africa since the end of
apartheid has been in danger of being canceled in a dispute over
pay and conditions.
	   Earlier Monday, South Africa's cricket board was forced to call
off the first match of the tour _ Tuesday's warmup between the West
Indies and an amateur 11 in Randjiesfontein, near Johannesburg.
	   The opening match now would now be in Soweto on Wednesday
against a Gauteng provincial 11.
	   The opening first-class match of the tour is due to start
Saturday against Griqualand and West. The first Test is set for
Nov. 26.
	   The apparent settlement came after four days of talks involving
the West Indies players and officials of the West Indies and South
Africa cricket boards.
	   The crisis came to a head last Wednesday when the West Indies
Cricket Board fired superstar batsman Lara as captain and Hooper as
vice-captain. The two had refused to travel to South Africa,
demanding better pay and conditions for the tour.
	   Team members have insisted that Lara and Hooper be reinstated as
part of any settlement.
	   Jimmy Adams, treasurer of the players' assocation, negotiated on
behalf of the players Monday with Pat Rousseau, president of the
West Indies Cricket Board.
	   Ali Bacher, head of South African cricket, also was directly
involved in Monday's talks after sitting on the sidelines Sunday.
	   West Indies tour manager Clive Lloyd and WICB member Joel Garner
have also been involved in the talks which began Friday.
	   Progress was reported over the weekend with the announcement of
a sponsorship deal offered by former South African wicketkeeper
David Richardson, who runs a sports marketing firm in Johannesburg.
	   Earnings from the sponsorship proposal would apparently help
meet the players' demands for better pay, which is reported to
range from dlrs 15,000 to 60,000 for the South African tour.

British Defense Minister: Iraq's time is running out
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Incorporates Kuwait-Britain-Iraq

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ British Defense Secretary George
Robertson warned that ``time is running out'' for Iraq and Baghdad
must allow weapons inspectors to resume their work.
	   ``Our patience is running out, his (Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein's) time is running out,'' Robertson said.
	   Robertson was speaking in the Gulf state of Bahrain, which hosts
the headquarters of the U.S. 5th Fleet.
	   He said the emirate recognizes ``that there may be no other
option left than the one Saddam respects most,'' military force.
	   Robertson said Crown Prince Sheik Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa ``was
able to confirm that Bahrain would support the calls being made on
Saddam to comply and that the option of force must remain there,
must be one of the options.''
	   British and U.S. officials have been lobbying Arab countries to
back a possible strike against Iraq. There is, however, little
support for military action against Iraq in the Arab world, where
most people sympathize with Iraqi civilians suffering under U.N.
sanctions.
	   Robertson said that while Britain was seeking a diplomatic
solution it was prepared to use force.
	   Britain and the United States have not ruled out military
strikes on Iraq to force Baghdad to rescind its Oct. 31 decision to
halt all work by the United Nations Special Commission, which
oversees the dismantling of Iraq's chemical and biological weapons
program and long-range missiles.
	   Baghdad says the disarmament work cannot resume until the U.N.
Security Council gives a timetable for lifting the economic
sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which
sparked the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Some 1,000 U.S. Navy support personnel are based on Bahrain.
	   British VC-10 tanker aircraft are also based on the island.
	   Robertson visited Kuwait before stopping in Bahrain.
	   Robertson said his Kuwait visit should ``give a message that
should go directly to Baghdad: Do not underestimate the resolution
of the international community.''
	   He spoke at Kuwait's Ali al-Salem air base, standing beneath the
wing of a Tornado strike aircraft.
	   The warplane is among the 12 GR1 Tornadoes based in Kuwait and
serviced by 400 Royal Air Force personnel. Britain also has two
frigates, HMS Grafton and HMS Cumberland, in Gulf waters.
	   Robertson was later expected to return to Britain.

Government presents budget cuts of dlrs 7.3 billion
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details on the budget cuts. New to some points. &QL; 
 &UR; By STAN LEHMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ The government on Monday presented a
revised version of its 1999 budget to include one of the most
important items of its fiscal austerity package: a hefty cut of 8.7
billion reals (dlrs 7.3 billion), which some observers say will
mostly affect the poor.
	   The new budget, which must be approved by Congress by Dec. 15,
puts total federal spending next year at 41.4 billion reals (dlrs
34.8 billion), or 17 percent lower than the budget proposal
submitted to Congress in late August.
	   At a news conference, Paiva said the cuts were needed to
``adjust the budget to Brazil's new economic scenario and to the
fiscal austerity program.''
	   He said the new budget assumes a drop in gross domestic product
of 1 percent in 1999.
	   Paiva said that investments in land reform and transportation
projects would suffer the largest cuts _ 47.1 percent and 42.8
percent, respectively.
	   Smaller cuts were announced in social areas like health, 6.6
percent; education, 12.3 percent; and social security, 12.7
percent.
	   Paiva said the tax hikes called for in the fiscal stabilization
program would increase federal revenue by 16.19 billion reals (dlrs
13.6 billion). He added that inflation in 1999 would be about 2
percent.
	   President Fernando Henrique Cardoso announced the budget cut two
weeks ago when he outlined the belt-tightening measures aimed at
shoring up Brazil's ailing economy.
	   At the time, Cardoso said the ``unprecedented'' cut ``clearly
demonstrates the government's determination to achieve a fiscal
balance as soon as possible.''
	   He said the budget could not be slashed any further ``without
paralyzing essential government services,'' and that the spending
cuts were designed so as not to burden the poor.
	   However, several observers have said they would affect the poor
since money will become scarcer for already precarious public
schools and hospitals.
	   ``The country's social apartheid will grow,'' said Oded Grajew,
a leading Sao Paulo businessman, who heads a children's rights
foundation.
	   ``The rich send their children to private schools and
hospitals,'' Grajew said. ``The poor have to relay on public school
and health systems, which will go from bad to worse with the budget
cuts.''
	   The budget cuts, together with the tax hikes that make up the
fiscal austerity package, are part of the government's efforts to
save 28 billion reals (nearly dlrs 24 billion) next year.
	   The government hopes the measures will qualify Brazil for an
International Monetary Fund-led rescue package, expected to be
unveiled sometime this week.
	   The IMF had insisted on a tough and realistic plan to slash
Brazil's budget deficit before going ahead with an estimated dlrs
30 billion-to dlrs 40 billion rescue plan, which many see as the
only way to contain the spreading global financial crisis that has
already hit Asia and Russia.
	   In Washington, Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said
on Monday that Brazil's fiscal adjustment program could help
stabilize the region.
	   ``Brazil has faced serious pressures in recent months, pressures
that have underlined the need for the country's longstanding fiscal
vulnerabilities to be addressed,'' Summers said.
	   ``President Cardoso has committed the government to a fiscal
adjustment program that _ decisively implemented _ can provide a
foundation for future growth and stability,'' he said.
	   He said the United States and the international community
``expressed their desire to support these efforts, in whose success
we all have such an important stake.''

FIFA: postponement could bring France back into Confederations Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 6th graf with comment from Mexican organizers. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Postponement of the Confederations
Cup, scheduled for January, is being considered and could persuade
world champion France to take part, a FIFA spokesman said Monday.
	   France last month pulled out of the event after many European
clubs and domestic leagues made it clear they didn't want to
release their French players for the event, which comes in the
middle of league seasons.
	   ``There is a consensus among the participants that postponement
would be possible'' and that consequently ``French participation
would be possible,'' FIFA spokesman Andreas Herren said.
	   A final decision on dates for the tournament will be made Nov.
17, Herren said. If the tournament is postponed, it will likely
take place in late July or early August, he added.
	   Some regard the event as an unneeded one that exhausts already
burned out players.
	   In Mexico, Justino Compean, president of the cup's local
organizing committee, said the event is being pushed back to
August, but France's participation is still unclear.
	   ``Les Bleus'' were scheduled to represent Europe in the
competition, along with teams from Brazil, Mexico, Bolivia, the
United States, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Australia.
	   Roger Lemerre, the new coach of the French team, had been in
favor of the French team's participation, which would have allowed
him to test out new players.

	   The first West Indies tour of South Africa since the end of
apartheid had been in danger of being canceled in a players' revolt
over pay and conditions.
	   But, after four days of closed-door talks at a London hotel,
Rousseau said the dispute had grown out of a ``misunderstanding''
and the tour would go ahead.
	   Rousseau said the West Indies will play their opening match in
Soweto on Wednesday against a Gauteng provincial 11.
	   Earlier Monday, South Africa's cricket board was forced to call
off the first match of the tour _ Tuesday's warmup between the West
Indies and an amateur 11 in Randjiesfontein, near Johannesburg.
	   The opening first-class match of the tour is due to start
Saturday against Griqualand and West. The first Test is set for
Nov. 26.

Mexico, Europe begin negotiations on free trade plans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ELLIOT SPAGAT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ With the opening ceremonies behind them and
negotiating teams in place, Mexico and the European Union on Monday
began the nitty-gritty work of creating a free-trade zone.
	   No breakthroughs were expected in the first five days of talks
at Mexico's Commerce Secretariat. But many observers hoped for a
glimpse of how far apart the two sides really are.
	   Negotiators are scheduled to meet every six weeks until June,
with the second and third rounds in Brussels and subsequent rounds
alternating between Mexico City and Brussels.
	   For the European Union, the free-trade zone would be its first
in the Americas and might offer a better launching pad to the U.S.
and Canada, Mexico's partners in the North American Free Trade
Agreement.
	   It would also further open Mexico, the world's 15th-largest
economy with about 100 million consumers.
	   For Mexico, the talks offer hope of narrowing its trade deficit
with Europe and weaning itself from the United States, the
destination of about 85 percent of its exports.
	   ``We haven't been able to conquer Europe and the potential is
very significant,'' said Eduardo Medina Mora, director of strategic
planning at Mexican conglomerate Desc SA who advises the government
on trade.
	   His export-oriented company is a case in point: 80 percent of
Desc's exports go to the United States, only 5 percent to Europe.
	   The 15-nation European Union as a bloc is Mexico's
second-biggest trading partner, but two-way commerce accounted for
only 6.4 percent of Mexican trade during the first six months of
the year, down from 14.5 percent 10 years ago.
	   Mexican exports to the Union totaled about dlrs 4 billion last
year, while EU exports to Mexico were about dlrs 10 billion.
	   The EU official in charge of relations with Latin America,
Manuel Marin, said last month that an agreement was likely sometime
next year.
	   Negotiators hope to finish before Mexican presidential elections
in 2000, but Marin said he wouldn't be concerned if they didn't,
because he expects Mexican opposition politicians to be supportive.
	   The free-trade zone must be approved by the Mexican Senate.
	   Mexican farmers worry they will be overwhelmed by their European
counterparts and are likely to press Europe to lower subsidies to
its own farmers.
	   Tropical fruits and sugar, which enter Europe under agreements
with African and Caribbean nations, and dairy products are
especially touchy.
	   ``We can compete with anyone on an even playing field,'' said
Amadeo Ibarra, director of Mexico's National Association of Cooking
Oil Industries. ``We're definitely ready to accept European
products, as long as they're not subsidized.''
	   A top Mexican negotiator, Fernando de Mateo Venturini,
acknowledged that freeing agricultural trade ``won't be easy,'' but
said different harvest times in Europe and Mexico could help foster
agreement.
	   De Mateo said ``everything was on the table'' in the
negotiations _ or almost everything. The Mexican Constitution
prohibits private investment in oil production and refining,
natural gas production and the transmission and distribution of
electricity.
	   One Mexican concern is that Europeans may seek to impose their
rules on everything from food inspection to auto safety as a way to
block competition.
	   Mexican textile manufacturers also worry that Europeans may
repackage Asian products as European goods, said Tito Kuri,
president of Mexico's National Textile Association.

	   Word of the agreement leaked out when former captain Courtney
Walsh, head of the West Indies players association, told the
Caribbean News Agency that Lara and Hooper had been reinstated and
the tour was going ahead.
	   The crisis came to a head last Wednesday when the West Indies
Cricket Board fired superstar batsman Lara as captain and Hooper as
vice-captain. The two had refused to travel to South Africa,
demanding better pay and conditions for the tour.
	   Team members had insisted that Lara and Hooper be reinstated as
part of any settlement.

behalf of the players Monday with Rousseau.
	   Ali Bacher, head of South African cricket, also was directly
involved in Monday's talks after sitting on the sidelines Sunday.
	   West Indies tour manager Clive Lloyd and WICB member Joel Garner
were also involved in the talks which began Friday.
	   Progress was reported over the weekend with the announcement of
a sponsorship deal offered by former South African wicketkeeper
David Richardson, who runs a sports marketing firm in Johannesburg.
	   Earnings from the sponsorship proposal would apparently help
meet the players' demands for better pay, which is reported to
range from dlrs 15,000 to 60,000 for the South African tour.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Judiciary Committee Republicans renewed their
commitment Monday to forge ahead with their inquiry of President
Bill Clinton as they bandied with scholars about what constitutes
an impeachable offense.
	   The euphoria for Democrats of electon victories and the
departure of Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich faded fast,
with the Supreme Court issuing two rulings unfavorable to Clinton
and Justice Department lawyers interviewing him on possible
illegalities with financing of past campaigns.
	   ``I really believe that notion that no man is above the law,''
Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde said Monday.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A settlement was reached Monday to allow the West
Indies cricket tour of South Africa to go ahead.
	   Pat Rousseau, president of the West Indies Cricket Board,
announced Monday night that Brian Lara had been reinstated as team
captain and Carl Hooper as vice captain.
	   Rousseau said no disciplinary action would be taken against Lara
and Hooper and the two would join the rest of the team for a flight
to South Africa Monday night.
	   The first West Indies tour of South Africa since the end of
apartheid had been in danger of being canceled in a players' revolt

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Japanese qualifyer Takao Suzuki upset
eight-seeded Thomas Enqvist 6-4, 2-6, 6-4 to move into the second
round of the dlrs 825,000 Stockholm Open tennis tournament Monday.
	   Suzuki, who swept past three more experienced players in the
qualification round, broke Enqvist, a twofold Stockholm Open
winner, for 5-4 in the deciding set and then served home the match.
	   The win was his second in an ATP-tournament, the first coming in
Japan Open when de defeated Swedish Davis Cupper Nicklas Kulti, one
of his victims in the qualifications.
	   The 22-year-old from Sapporo, who is coached by Italian Claudio
Pistolesi, said fast indoor floors is his favorite surface.
	   ``We have got plenty of such indoors courts in Sapporo,'' said
Suzuki, who is 122nd on the latest ATP-ranking.
	   ``It was certainly my biggest win so far, said the Japanese, who
earlier this year won three Challenge tournaments.
	   In the second round Suzuki plays Kenneth Carlsen of Denmark, who
overcame also unseeded Fredrik Jonsson of Sweden, 6-4, 7-6 (7-5).
	   Two Swedish players, who are fighting for the singles spots on
the Swedish Davis Cup team in the DC final versus Italy in early
December, saw action. Magnus Gustafsson, a traditional clay court
player beat Rainer Schuttler of Germany 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 while
Stockholm Open defending champion Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden
outgunned German Marc-Kevin Goellner 6-4, 6-2.
	   ``I had less problems with his serve this year. I also made him
move more and he is not so fast,'' said Bjorkman after his victory.
	   Other winners in singles action were Geoff Grant, an American
qualifyer, who beat Michael Kohlmann of Germany 6-3, 6-3 and Wayne
Ferreira of South Africa who beat Jens Knippschild of Germany 6-4,
6-2.
	   Third-seeded Briton Tim Henman, who is hoping to qualify for the
ATP World Championships in Hanover, easily overcame Mikael
Tillstrom of Sweden 6-3,6-1.
	   The big guns don*t see action until Wednesday. American Pete
Sampras, trying to end the season as No. 1 for a record sixth
consecutive year, has accepted a wild card. Greg Rusedski of
Britain, who beat Sampras in the Paris Open final Sunday, also
plays his first round match Wednesday.
	   Sampras has never won the Stockholm Open, one of the world*s
oldest indoor tournaments. He reached the semifinal in 1994, when
it was held in the 14,000-seat Globe Arena. In 1995, the tournament
returned across town to its original site, the Royal Tennis Hall.

Tillstrom of Sweden 6-3,6-1.
	   The big guns don't see action until Wednesday. American Pete
Sampras, trying to end the season as No. 1 for a record sixth
consecutive year, has accepted a wild card. Greg Rusedski of
Britain, who beat Sampras in the Paris Open final Sunday, also
plays his first round match Wednesday.
	   Sampras has never won the Stockholm Open, one of the world's
oldest indoor tournaments. He reached the semifinal in 1994, when
it was held in the 14,000-seat Globe Arena. In 1995, the tournament
returned across town to its original site, the Royal Tennis Hall.

Bermuda chooses between conservatives and black party

	   HAMILTON, Bermuda (AP) _ In the closest election race in
Bermuda's history, islanders choose Monday between conservatives
who have governed for 30 years and the party supported by most
working-class blacks.
	   The biggest issue in Bermuda, Britain's most populous remaining
colony of about 60,000, is an economy dependent on the booming but
threatened off-shore banking industry and declining tourism.
	   Off-shore banks have been attacked by countries fighting drug
traffickers, who say they provide a haven for the illegal profits
of drug lords. Britain has called for greater regulation of the
industry, as has the the European Union.
	   But the industry allows Bermudians to enjoy one of the highest
standards of living in the world, with a per capita income of dlrs
36,000.
	   Some 36,000 voters are registered to elect 40 legislators. Polls
opened at 10 a.m. (14:00 GMT) and were to close at 10 p.m. (0200
GMT). Results were expected after midnight; with many tight races,
officials expected to have to recount some votes.
	   The leader of the party with the most votes is elected prime
minister.
	   Premier Pamela Gordon's United Bermuda Party was founded by the
white merchant class descended from Britons who settled in Bermuda
in the 1600s and make up 35 percent of the population.
	   Gordon is the daughter of a famous labor leader and is black, as
is most of her Cabinet, but the party still is seen as one of the
white establishment and conservative. Both the island's parties
have moved more to the political center in recent years.
	   Most Bermudians are blacks of African descent who tend to
support the Progressive Labour Party, led by Jennifer Smith, which
currently has 18 seats in the Parliament.
	   Racial tensions dominated politics here in the 1970s and race
riots erupted in 1972-1973 and in 1977.
	   Many voters say they want politics to stop focusing on race and
start talking about other problems facing Bermudians: declining
education standards and the lack of affordable housing on their
22-square-mile (57-square-kilometer) island.
	   Also a worry are drugs and crime, which are causing increasing
problems on the island, 670 miles (1,000 kilometers) off the
Atlantic coast of North Carolina, though it prides itself as one of
the safest holiday destinations.
	   Grant Gibbons, candidate for the governing party, said Monday
that he and fellow candidate had got ``very warm support'' from a
``quite steady'' stream of voters.

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Venezuela's army and wealthy elite
reacted nervously Monday to a big electoral victory by a leftist
coalition led by a former army officer who tried to overthrow the
government six years ago.
	   Hugo Chavez's Patriotic Pole movement won the largest share of
Venezuela's parliament in nationwide balloting for governors and
congressmen, sending the stock market sharply lower and stirring
worries that the army might start flexing its muscle.
	   But millions of Venezuelans, angered over declining living
standards in the country with the most oil outside the Middle East,
were elated by Sunday's election results, which gave Chavez a major
boost in his bid to win the presidency in Dec. 6 elections.
	   ``The Venezuelan people have awakened,'' said the 44-year-old
former army paratrooper who is leading all presidential polls. ``We
are going to build a new democracy.''
	   Sunday's vote was a devastating setback to Democratic Action and
Copei, the traditional parties that have ruled Venezuela for
decades.
	   Though final results were not available Monday afternoon, the
early tally showed Patriotic Pole winning 34 percent of the
congressional seats. Democratic Action won about 22 percent, and
Copei won 11 percent.
	   Project Venezuela, a new party led by Chavez's main challenger,
Yale-educated businessman Henrique Salas, had about 12 percent.
	   Venezuelans swamped polling stations to elect 189 lower house
members, 48 senators, 23 governors and 391 state assembly members.
	   Aware that his candidacy has polarized the country, Chavez has
toned down his populist rhetoric in recent months, calling for a
version of British Prime Minister Tony Blair's Third Way _ a
compromise between unfettered capitalism and socialism.
	   It's not clear if the business community is buying it, however.
The election results were received joyously in the hillside slums
ringing Caracas, but ominously in the plush tree-lined
neighborhoods where the rich live.
	   ``If he is the Chavez who most people think he is _ the
populist, the Peronist, the guy who's going to set the clock back _
then this is not only bad news, it's disastrous news,'' said
economist Roberto Bottome.
	   ``If on the other hand, he's the Tony Blair who some people
think he is, it's not bad news. ... In the meantime, if I were an
investor, I'd stay away,'' Bottome added.
	   Within the first 15 minutes of trading Monday, the Caracas stock
exchange fell 2.5 percent on news of Chavez's success, and ended
even lower, down 3.4 percent for the day.
	   While strengthening Chavez's presidential prospects, Sunday's
vote could also cause anti-Chavez factions to regroup in a unified
alliance, possibly led by Project Venezuela's Salas.
	   Among those most vehemently opposed to Chavez is army chief Gen.
Ruben Rojas Perez, who recently implied the armed forces would seek
to block the former coup leader's rise to power.
	   Sunday's election could galvanize opposition within the military
and feed persistent rumors of an impending coup to prevent him from
coming to power.
	   ``There will surely be problems because of Chavez's
conspiratorial past and his lack of moral authority to be the
commander in chief of the armed forces,'' said Gen. Fernando Ochoa
Antich, who was defense minister during Chavez's attempted coup.
	   President Rafael Caldera has been trying to calm the waters by
promising to respect the voters' will. His Convergence Party, which
broke away from Copei five years ago, was not a major player in
Sunday's balloting.
	   As expected, Democratic Action and Copei captured most of
Venezuela's 23 governorships on Sunday. But Chavez's coalition won
seven races for governor in states that comprise more than a third
of the country's population. And in a surprise showing, Chavez's
father, Hugo de los Reyes Chavez, was elected governor of the
western state of Barinas.
	   Although the roots of Venezuela's deep economic woes are
complex, most people blame the traditional parties for squandering
the country's vast oil wealth.
	   ``If you have gold and diamonds in your garden, there is no
reason to live in misery,'' said Luis Castillo, a 58-year-old house
painter who supports Chavez.
	   Carlos Andres Perez, the former president whom Chavez tried to
overthrow six years ago, won a senate seat in his home state of
Tachira. Promising to oppose a possible Chavez administration, he
said Sunday's results ``did not help but instead aggravated the
circumstances in which Venezuela's social and political life is
played out.''
	   While running for senate, Perez had been under house arrest
pending charges of illegal enrichment. His victory gives him
parliamentary immunity and his freedom.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Text of joint statement by the West Indies Cricket
Board and the West Indies Players' Association:
	   ``The West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) and members of the West
Indies Players' Association (WIPA) have reached agreement on terms
that will allow the team's tour of South Africa to proceed.
	   After lengthy talks between players and officials at a Heathrow
hotel over the past two days, both sides acknowledged that the
dispute originally stemmed from a misunderstanding between the two
parties.
	   All issues related to fees and conditions for the South African
tour have been resolved between the two parties.
	   Mr. Lara and Mr. Hooper have been reinstated as captain and
vice-captain respectively and will fly out to South Africa with the
rest of the team tonight. No disciplinary action will be taken
against any of the players.
	   The first match will now take place in Soweto on Wednesday; the
original match against Nicky Oppenheimer's XI in Midrand (scheduled
for Tuesday) has been postponed.
	   The agreement between the WICB and WIPA covers a number of
issues:
	   _ Reaffirmation of WICB's recognition of WIPA's representative
role;
	   _ WICB and WIPA will work closely in a joint marketing program
from which all funding raised will be shared between the players
and the WICB;
	   _ The WICB retainer initiative will be reintroduced as soon as
practicable;
	   _ WICB will take all practical steps to improve remuneration of
players on future tours;
	   _ WICB will review current insurance cover to ensure adequacy;
	   _ WICB will consider and review the grievance and disciplinary
code and all procedures, including appeals.
	   The WICB and WIPA are satisfied with their agreement, which was
reached in a spirit of compromise against a background of
international concern. Both parties recognize the historical and
social significance of the South Africa tour and appreciate the
high expectations of everyone in the Caribbean, South Africa and
around the world.
	   The WICB and WIPA would like to acknowledge the constructive
support received from President Mandela and the Caribbean
governments towards achieving an amicable and mutually satisfactory
resolution to this dispute.''

Minnesota's not so fat at QB anymore
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVE GOLDBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Football Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   For the last month, Dennis Green's Vikings has had two
first-rate starting quarterbacks, Randall Cunningham and Brad
Johnson.
	   Now Green has the same problem of many of his colleagues _ no
legitimate starting QBs. At least none that is healthy.
	   Cunningham injured a knee Sunday, then Johnson broke the thumb
on his throwing hand, although he played with it through the entire
second half of the 31-24 win over New Orleans.
	   Johnson is out for four weeks. And while Cunningham, who had
chips removed from his right knee Monday, could play against
Cincinnati at the Metrodome next Sunday, the starting quarterback
is almost sure to be Jay Fiedler.
	   Fiedler is smart. He went to Dartmouth.
	   And he has good genes. His father has been a successful high
school basketball coach in New York City. The quarterback is also a
distant relative of the late Boston Pops conductor Arthur Fiedler.
	   But in three NFL seasons _ he was unemployed last year _ he has
thrown exactly four passes, all on Oct. 18, mopping up against
Washington. He completed two for 29 yards.
	   The injuries to Johnson and Cunningham were part of a bad day
for quarterbacks. Steve Young and Erik Kramer sat out; John Elway
threw three passes: Troy Aikman injured a finger, although he
returned to complete 10 of 11 in the second half against the
Giants; Jeff George reinjured his groin; and Mark Brunell sat out
the second half of Jacksonville's win over the Bengals to rest his
groin pull.
	   In other words, the second half of the season started like the
first half began.
	   In the first two weeks of the season, 11 quarterbacks were
knocked out of games with injuries. Then people stayed healthy _
until Sunday.
	   Now Minnesota, which at 8-1 has the best record in the NFC, has
problems again. But at least they have those two quarterbacks.
	   ``I'd like to come back and play next week if I could,'' said
Johnson, who had a cast on his hand Monday. ``You deal with the
cards you were dealt.''
	   Cincinnati might not be a problem, although the Bengals tend to
win games in the second half of the year, when they no longer have
much to play for. The Vikings, particularly at home, can beat them
by handing off to Robert Smith and letting Fiedler throw jump balls
to Cris Carter, Jake Reed and Randy Moss.
	   Cunningham should be ready when Green Bay comes to Minnesota,
although who knows how mobile he'll be against a rejuvenated pass
rush featuring Reggie White, Santana Dotson, Vonnie Holliday and
the blitzing LeRoy Butler. Then the Vikes get three days rest
before going to Dallas for a Thanksgiving game.
	   Entering this weekend, the Vikings had a good shot at home field
throughout the playoffs. They still do, but put a big question mark
after it.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The scars that run up and down Picabo Street's
legs are painful remainders of her fightening crash eight months
ago in Switzerland.
	   But the real pain from the accident that shattered her left leg
and tore up her right knee rests with the psyche of the top U.S.
skier, the 1998 Olympic gold medalist in the super G.
	   ``I have a real strong feeling that I am going to be too afraid
to run downhill again,'' said Street, the lone American to win the
World Cup downhill crown.
	   ``And if I am afraid to run downhill, I would be afraid to run
super G,'' said Street, her crutches nearby during a series of
promotional appearances Monday for the New York Ski and Snowboard
Ball.
	   Instead Street, who won the world downhill title in 1995-96 and
an Olympic silver medal in the downhill in 1994, will probably turn
to the slalom and giant slalom events. Her goal is to compete in
2000 and to be racing in the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City.
	   ``That's America, baby, and I can't imagine passing it up,''
said the 27-year-old Street, who had full reconstructive surgery on
her right knee four weeks ago.
	   In focusing on racing in the slower slalom and giant slalom
events, Street will be listening to her own fears of going too fast
again.
	   ``You play hard, you pay hard,'' she said. ``I'm not so sure
that I am ready to play that hard or pay that hard anymore.''

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Japanese qualifyer Takao Suzuki upset
eight-seeded Thomas Enqvist 6-4, 2-6, 6-4 to move into the second
round of the dlrs 825,000 Stockholm Open tennis tournament Monday.
	   Suzuki, who swept past three more experienced players in the
qualification round, broke Enqvist, a twofold Stockholm Open
winner, for 5-4 in the deciding set and then served home the match.
	   The win was his second in an ATP-tournament, the first coming in
Japan Open when de defeated Swedish Davis Cupper Nicklas Kulti, one
of his victims in the qualifications.
	   The 22-year-old from Sapporo, who is coached by Italian Claudio
Pistolesi, admitted fast indoor surface is his favorite surface.
	   ``We have got plenty of such indoors in Sapporo,'' said Suzuki,
who is 122nd on the latest ATP-ranking.
	   ``It was certainly my biggest win in my career,'' said the
Japanese, who earlier this year have won three Challenge
tournaments.
	   In the second round Suzuki plays Dane Kenneth Carlsen, who
overcame Fredrik Jonsson of Sweden, 6-4, 7-6 (7-5).
	   Also making it through to the second round, one of the world's
oldest indoors tournaments, is Swede Magnus Gustafsson who beat
Rainer Schuttler of Germany, 3-6, 6-4, 6-4.
	   Two Swedish players, who are fighting for the singles matches on
the Swedish Davis Cup team in the final against Italy early
December, saw action. Magnus Gustafsson, a traditional clay court
player beat Rainer Schuttler of Germany 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 while the
Stockholm Open defending champion Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden
outgunned German Marc-Kevin Goellner 6-4, 6-2.
	   Other winners in singles action were Geoff Grant, an American
qualifyer, who beat Michael Kohlmann of Germany 6-3, 6-3 and Wayne
Ferreira of South Africa who beat Jens Knippschild of Germany 6-4,
6-2.
	   Third-seeded Briton Tim Henman, who is close to qualifying for
the ATP World Championships in Hanover, whipped Mikael Tillstrom of
Sweden 6-3, 6-1 in 54 minutes.
	   ``I am very pleased with my game. My percentage in points won on
my serve was pretty high. I was also satisfied with my ground
strokes,'' said Henman who faces Ferreira in the next round.
	   ``It will be a tough match. He will obviously try to keep me
away from the net so I must play aggressively'' said the Briton who
has lost two out of three encounters with the South African.
	   The big guns don*t see action until Wednesday. American Pete
Sampras, trying to end the season as No. 1 for a record sixth
consecutive year, as well as Briton Greg Rusedski, who beat Sampras
in the Paris Open final Sunday, will have another day off.
	   Sampras has never won the tournament. He reached the semifinal
in 1994, when the tournament was held in the 14,000-seat Globe
Arena. In 1995, the tournament returned across town to its original
site, the Royal Tennis Hall.

 &UR; FIFA: postponement could bring France back into Confederations Cup &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with FIFA organizer saying games have been
postponed. No pickup. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Soccer's Confederations Cup, scheduled for
January, is being pushed back to August, but it's not clear if
that's enough to get world champion France's to participate, a FIFA
organizer said Monday.
	   Justino Compean, president of the local organizing committee of
FIFA's 1999 Confederations Cup, told the Associated Press in Mexico
that the event is being pushed back to August.
	   The schedule will remain mostly unchanged, but world champion
France's participation is still unclear, he said.
	   France last month pulled out of the event after many European
clubs and domestic leagues made it clear they didn't want to
release their French players for the event, which comes in the
middle of league seasons.
	   ``There is a consensus among the participants that postponement
would be possible'' and that consequently ``French participation
would be possible,'' FIFA spokesman Andreas Herren said.
	   A final decision on dates for the tournament will be made Nov.
17, Herren said. If the tournament is postponed, it will likely
take place in late July or early August, he added.
	   Some regard the event as an unneeded one that exhausts already
burned out players.
	   ``Les Bleus'' were scheduled to represent Europe in the
competition, along with teams from Brazil, Mexico, Bolivia, the
United States, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Australia.
	   Roger Lemerre, the new coach of the French team, had been in
favor of the French team's participation, which would have let him
test new players.

Kirov back in United States for another rarity
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; An AP Entertainment Review &QL; 
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Kirov Opera seems to be in the West more
than in Russia these days.
	   After presenting four productions at the Metropolitan Opera last
spring, the Kirov returned to New York last weekend for a three-day
run at Carnegie Hall that ended Sunday with a concert performance
of Tchaikovsky's ``Iolanta.''
	   Valery Gergiev, the director of the Kirov's Mariinsky Theater in
St. Petersburg, Russia, has become the world's leading evangelist
for Russian opera, bringing attention to works that have been
mostly neglected and ignored in the major houses of the West.
	   This time, the scenery and props were left back in Russia, and
the orchestra was thrust into the spotlight. (The weekend opened
with a symphonic Tchaikovsky evening followed by a complete version
of ``The Nutcracker,'' the Kirov's latest CD release.)
	   ``Iolanta'' and ``The Nutcracker'' were composed by Tchaikovsky
following ``Queen of Spades'' and intended as a double bill. The
problem with ``Iolanta'' is not so much musical as dramatic. Just
as in some later Strauss operas, not much happens on stage. And
even for opera, the plot is silly.
	   But some of the music is glorious, and soprano Olga Guryakova
and tenor Gegam Grigorian stood out. Miss Guryakova, who joined the
company last year, had heft and shine in the title role, and
appears capable of moving into some of the Verdi roles that have
been hard to cast in recent years. Grigorian, who already has
appeared with many Western companies, has a major voice but seems
slightly stiff in his stage presence.
	   ``Iolanta,'' a 90-minute opera in nine scenes adapted by
Tchaikovsky from Henrik Hertz's ``King Rene's Daughter,'' is the
story of a princess who is blind and doesn't even realize it. A
Moorish doctor, Ibn-Hakia, tells King Rene (Mikhail Kit) she will
be able to see only if she desperately desires it. After she falls
in love with Vaudemont (Grigorian), a friend of Duke Robert of
Burgundy (Vassili Gerello), Ibn-Hakia (Nikolai Putilin) cures her.
	   While it was a satisfying performance, the lack of action made
it clear why ``Iolanta'' isn't more popular. But the Kirov, needing
to tour almost constantly in order to get Western currency, has
filed a void in the repertoire by presenting works such as this and
``Mazeppa,'' an intense Tchaikovsky opera that proved a revelation
at the Met last spring.
	   With the Kirov, you learn to accept imperfections. This time, it
was the transposition of two pages of the libretto that accompanied
the program. Nevertheless, the Kirov is proving to be one of the
more educational ensembles in the music world.

Brazil's Palmeiras look formidable; Paraguay's Olimpia eye bonuses
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil's Palmeiras aren't letting
anyone intimidate them at the moment.
	   That could spells bad news for Paraguay's Olimpia in the
Mercosur Cup semifinals on Tuesday in Brazil's Sao Paolo.
	   Brazil's league leaders have come through two tough matches in
the last week with gritty shows.
	   On Saturday, they shrugged off Vasco da Gama in a grudge match
because of bad blood between both clubs, winning 2-1.
	   And last week, they held Boca Juniors, backed by ex-player
Maradona and a partisan Argentinian crowd, to reach the semifinals.
	   Palmeiras coach Luiz Felipe Scolari puts his team's fight down
to playing with ten men against 11 reserves in training. ``When
we're a man short in a match, it doesn't scare us,'' he said.
	   Scolari was Monday slowing down training before tomorrow's
match, which defender Cleber may miss due to injury.
	   Full-back Arce, a Paraguaian international, is expected to play,
as is midfield talent, Alex, newly picked for Brazil, and strong
frontman, Oseas.
	   Olimpia, like Palmeiras, beat an Argentinian team (Vlez
Sarsfield) in the quarterfinals.
	   Now, their Urugayan coach Luis Cubilla is hoping money talks.
	   His players are eyeing the dlrs 10,000 bonus each player has
been promised if they beat the Brazilians. They got dlrs 6,000 each
for beating Vlez.
	   ``The tournament is turning into a goldmine. We want to get to
the final as there is a dlrs 3 million prize money,'' said team
captain Carlos Humberto Paredes.
	   Possible line-ups:
	   Palmeiras: Velloso, Arce, Junior Baiano, Agnaldo, Junior,
Galeano, Rogerio, Tiago, Alex, Paulo Nunes, Oseas.
	   Olimpia: Tavarelli, Ceres, Caniza, Zelaya, Franco, Jara,
Paredes, Prez, Avalos, Gonzalez, Caballero.

Puerto Rican statehood opponents suffer setback in lawsuit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Federal appeals judges ruled Monday
that a challenge to a Dec. 13 vote on possible statehood for Puerto
Rico should be heard by a U.S. court instead of a local one.
	   The Popular Democratic Party is challenging Gov. Pedro
Rossello's plans for a vote on statehood, independence or continued
U.S. commonwealth for the island. It claims the ballot for the vote
is rigged to favor statehood.
	   Judges in the U.S. First Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston
ruled Monday their lawsuit is a federal matter because it deals
with whether Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, is a colony under the
control of the U.S. Congress.
	   The Popular Democratic Party claims Puerto Rico's 1952
constitution gave the island limited autonomy from the United
States, so a local judge should be able to rule on the case.
	   The appeals court issued its decision in a three-line ruling and
promised a more detailed opinion ``in due course.'' It sent the
case back to a trial court in San Juan.
	   Popular Democratic Party officials have not said whether they
will appeal the case to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Lufthansa flight to Israel diverted after Israeli officials deny
</HEADLINE>
some passengers entry &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with plane landing in Tel Aviv without passengers in
question, comments from Lufthansa spokesman in Israel. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Lufthansa airline on Monday confirmed
a flight to Israel had been diverted to Istanbul, Turkey after
Israeli officials informed the airline they would not permit entry
to some passengers on board.
	   Lufthansa spokesman Markus Ruediger, declined to identify the
passengers, but said ``we had to divert the flight to Istanbul.''
	   ``This action became necessary after we at Lufthansa received
information that there were passengers on board that would not be
allowed to enter the state of Israel.''
	   Earlier Monday, Israeli radio reported that a group of right
wing extremists Germans on a Lufthansa flight bound for Israel,
were forced to land in Istanbul because the Israeli's wouldn't give
them entry visas.
	   In Israel, foreign ministry spokesman Aviv Shiron said the man
denied entry was Werner-Joachim Siegerist.
	   Siegerist, 51, heads the Hamburg-based extreme right ``Die
Deutschen Konservativen.''
	   He was sentenced to 18 months in prison in 1995 for incitement
to racial hatred because of a mass mailing describing gypsies as a
``criminal bunch.'' The sentenced was reduced to probation after he
appealed.
	   He once appealed for funds for his organization in an ad
commemorating Hitler's deputy Rudolf Hess.
	   Siegerist has dual German-Latvian citizenship and has also been
active in Latvian politics.
	   Yitzhak Vironi, Lufthansa spokesman in Israel told Israel radio
that the plane couldn't land because Israel was ``in the middle of
a serious problem.''
	   ``They made a decision to land the plane in Istanbul and to have
the people disembark,'' Vironi said.
	   Ruediger said the passengers in question were in a hotel in
Istanbul and would return to Frankfurt Tuesday morning. The
remaining passengers were put on the plane that landed four hours
late at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport Monday night.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Duke of Kent has become the first British
royal to make an official visit to Israel since the end of the
British Mandate in 1948.
	   The duke met with President Ezer Weizman and was to hold talks
with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, but no meeting was scheduled
with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   The Haaretz newspaper said Netanyahu's office was ``amazed'' the
duke didn't request a meeting with the prime minister.

duke hadn't intended to snub Netanyahu. ``The visit is a trade
visit,'' the ambassador said.
	   The duke, who is Queen Elizabeth II's cousin, said the trip
``means a lot to me because I think the achievements of this
country have been so remarkable in these 50 years.''
	   At least three members of the British royal family have made
private visits to Israel _ Princess Margaret, Prince Charles and
the queen's husband, the Duke of Edinburgh.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai film authorities have all but
killed the chance of remaking ``Anna and the King of Siam'' on
location, saying script revisions by 20th Century Fox don't go far
enough in changing historical inaccuracies deemed insulting to the
Thai monarchy.
	   Thailand's Film Board on Monday stood by a three-week-old
judgment that the movie, starring Oscar winner Jodie Foster and
Hong Kong star Chow Yun Fat, would offend Thai sensibilities.
	   ``Anna and the King'' is a remake of the 1946 ``Anna and the
King of Siam,'' starring Rex Harrison and Irene Dunne. It later
became a Broadway musical and 1956 film, ``The King and I,'' which
made Yul Brynner a major star.
	   The works were based on memoirs of Anna Leonowens, an
Englishwoman invited to Siam, as Thailand was then known, to teach
English to King Mongkut's children in the mid-19th century.
	   Thais consider Hollywood's portrayals of Mongkut _ a noted
Buddhist scholar and linguist who helped bring his country into the
modern era _ as an insulting caricature painting him as a brutal
buffoon.
	   ----- &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ Pop star Michael Jackson has settled a lawsuit
over tabloid stories that said his face was disfigured by cosmetic
surgery.
	   The terms of the settlement Monday with The Mirror were not
disclosed.
	   But the tabloid apologized for four 1992 articles, with
photographs, that suggested numerous operations had left the pop
star badly scarred.
	   ``The photographs were taken honestly and were not tampered
with, but The Mirror has since met with the plaintiff in person and
acknowledges that the photographs do not accurately represent the
plaintiff's true appearance,'' said Kevin Bays, a lawyer for the
publishers.

	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ When a car thief in southwestern Norway
couldn't get his stolen vehicle to start, he called the Falken auto
club to come help him. He ended up catching a lift to jail.
	   The auto club's mechanics at first thought the driver, who had
keys to the car, was just another stranded motorist, Falken
employee Jan-Kaare Helgeland told the Stavanger Aftenbladet
newspaper about Saturday's incident.
	   ``Our people got suspicious ... because the vehicle did not have
any license plates. The supposed owner seemed a little tipsy, and
could not explain why his license plates were missing,'' Helgeland
was quoted as saying in the newspaper's Monday edition.
	   The mechanics quietly called the police, and then proceeded to
work on the car. The car, an Opel Astra, had been stolen from an
auto paint shop in Stavanger, on Norway's southwestern coast.
	   It just wasn't the thief's day. Even though he had keys with a
built-in remote control, the car wouldn't start because of a defect
in its antitheft mechanism. The thief was arrested by police and
jailed.
	   ----- &QC; 
	   FAIRMOUNT, Delaware (AP) _ A huge air cannon inspired by the
Martian character in the popular Bugs Bunny cartoons was the
winning entry in an annual pumpkin-flinging contest in a Delaware
town.
	   The device, called ``Aludium Q36 Pumpkin Modulator,'' fired a
pumpkin a 4,026 feet (1,227 meters) _ a record for the Pumpkin'
Chunkin' competition in Fairmont.
	   The event was founded in response to a barroom bet in 1985 by
Trey Melson, also a contestant. His camouflage-painted, compressed
air cannon, ``Universal Soldier'' won one of last year's events
with a toss of 3,718 feet (1,133 meters). It placed third this
year.
	   The field of contestants also included an all-women team called
``Bad Hair Day,'' with a machine powered by two septic tank
compressor trucks. Another entry, built by a University of
Massachusetts engineering student, used liquid nitrogen and boiling
water.
	   ``I retrofitted it to come down here,'' said Randy Kezar, 23,
who had built the cannon to shoot honeydew melons.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ Prince Charles rang the bell to start
trading on Macedonia's tiny stock market as he wound up a weeklong
tour of Eastern Europe.
	   The 2-year-old exchange in this former communist nation has only
eight licensed brokerages and two listed companies.
	   Charles also chatted Monday with directors of small companies
partially financed by British loans. They showed him their wares,
including bathroom tissue, basketball hoops and chemical-free
cabbages.
	   Most of the country's business and industrial sectors are still
in state hands six years after Macedonia split peacefully from
Yugoslavia.

nothing to do but to tell that the battle is expected, and
afterwards that a battle has been fought, in which we and our
friends, whether conquering or conquered, did all, and our enemies
did nothing _ Samuel Johnson, English critic (1709-1784).

Have Asian economies bottomed out? Many see a glass still
</HEADLINE>
half-empty &QL; 
 &UR; By PAULINE JELINEK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The first victims of the financial
turmoil lashing many world economies are finally beginning to show
signs of revival.
	   After 16 months of bad news and suffering, some say Asian
economies have hit bottom and recovery is just around the corner.
	   ``It's just a matter of time,'' said Arporn Chewakreng, senior
adviser to Thailand's prime minister.
	   Others aren't so optimistic.
	   ``The outlook is rather precarious,'' said Siew Hean, an
economist in Malaysia.
	   Assessing Asia's fortunes these days is like declaring the glass
half-full or half-empty _ and more economists seem to think it's
the latter.
	   The region's plight will be a key topic at next week's meeting
of world leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. President Clinton will be among those
attending.
	   The financial crisis, which began in July 1997 in Southeast
Asia, has engulfed Russia and buffeted some Latin American
countries, particularly Brazil, the largest.
	   In assessing Asia's economic health, analysts say currency
problems that strangled nations' financial systems and helped
plunge the region into recession are largely stabilized. Many
countries have begun reforms to fix heavily indebted banking
systems and bankrupt industries and strengthen their economies.
	   ``They have gotten one nostril above water,'' said Stephen
Marvin of Jardine Flemming and Co. in Seoul.
	   But once-roaring economies have fallen hard this year.
Indonesia's economy, expected to contract 15 percent this year, has
been thrown into depression.
	   Thailand's economy is forecast to shrink 8 percent this year,
South Korea's about 7 percent and Malaysia's some 6 percent. The
Japanese economy, the world's second-largest, is likely to contract
2.5 percent, its deepest recession since World War II.
	   With economies in the United States and Europe slowing, Asian
nations could have more difficulty clawing their way back to
recovery.
	   So why the talk about revival?
	   Foreign investors, who fled Asia in a panic last year, have been
pouring money into stock markets across the region over the last
month, pushing indexes up dramatically _ nearly 20 percent in
Japan, and 30 percent in both Hong Kong and South Korea.
	   Also, currencies are strengthening and interest rates falling,
which could help ease debt repayment problems that fueled the
crisis in the first place.
	   ``We're having a bout of confidence,'' said Harvey Goldstein, an
American business consultant in Indonesia.
	   Part of the confidence comes from a string of favorable
developments since late September.
	   Japan finally approved a long-delayed plan to deal with its
insolvent banks. And the United States, Canada and several European
countries cut interest rates in a bid to boost their economies and
protect them from the financial chaos.
	   But recession has long since hit Asia. And analysts say there
are likely more dark days ahead for the region's devastated
economies _ stock market rallies notwithstanding.
	   ``I don't see any fundamental improvement on the ground,'' said
Hotasi Nababan of the civic Indonesian Professional Society for
Reform.
	   Exports and industrial production are still falling.
Unemployment is rising and should continue to do so as more
companies are pushed into restructuring or bankruptcy, analysts
say.
	   ``When you talk about the economy, you should see beyond the
surface,'' said Lee Han-gu of the private think-tank Daewoo
Economic Research Center in South Korea.
	   Huge trade deficits in most countries, for instance, have turned
into soaring surpluses this year. But it's the result not of
improved exports, but collapsing imports. Consumers and
manufacturers pared buying this year to the tune of 34 percent in
both Indonesia and Malaysia, and 40 percent in Thailand and Korea.
	   Most predictions are that Thailand and South Korea won't bottom
out for another six months, and Indonesia possibly after that.
	   And those aren't guarantees. Some economists won't even rule out
the possibility of slipping back into another crisis.
	   Some analysts fear an overly rosy interpretation of how things
stand now could become an excuse for letting further reforms fall
by the wayside.
	   Many of the region's gun-shy banks are still not lending. And
many conglomerates are still not paring their bloated empires in an
effort to improve efficiency.

Economic doldrums reach Guyana

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Every morning, businessmen, travelers
heading abroad and even an occasional diplomat wait outside
Georgetown's banks to buy U.S. dollars. Many are turned away.
	   The acute dollar shortage is just one symptom of the recession
now facing Guyana, just recently hailed by the World Bank for its
successful tightfisted fiscal policy.
	   Race riots, falling gold prices and a cumbersome bureaucracy
have frustrated President Janet Jagan's goals of marketing Guyana's
vast mineral and timber resources and rain forest tourist
attractions.
	   Guyana's economy shrank 2.4 percent between January and July
after growing by an average 7 percent annually through the 1990s,
causing nervous investors to send their earnings abroad.
	   ``We are not sure how much. ... No one is sure,'' said Allan
Parris, managing director of Citizens Bank Guyana Ltd.
	   But everyone blames the capital flight for causing an acute
dollar shortage.
	   ``It is going to drive people crazy unless something is done,''
said Hardat Singh, who needs dollars to buy foreign-made articles
for his import business, which sells everything from electrical
wire to balloons.
	   Diplomats with the Guyana-based Caribbean Community often have
to place orders three weeks in advance to get foreign currencies
from local banks. The alternative is the black market, where
foreign cash is more expensive.
	   All this is vastly different from where Guyana seemed to be
heading two years ago.
	   In 1996, World Bank President James Wolfenson visited Guyana and
praised the government for abandoning decades-old dabbling in
socialism, reducing foreign debt and privatizing state-run
businesses.
	   Last year, Jagan's People's Progressive Party government claimed
to have created more than 30,000 jobs, cut unemployment to below 12
percent and reduced the foreign debt from dlrs 2.1 billion to dlrs
1.5 billion.
	   The slide began in January, when Guyanese of African descent
rioted to support opposition leader Desmond Hoyte's charges of
fraud in December presidential elections. Jagan is supported by
Indo-Guyanese, a majority in the country of 750,000.
	   Weeks of race riots prompted Canada's Saskatchewan Power to back
out of a dlrs 22.5 million deal to buy 50 percent of the state
Guyana Electricity Corp. It also hurt efforts to promote tourism,
which earned a paltry dlrs 100,000 last year.
	   Guyana's economy has taken other hits. World prices for gold _
Guyana's second-biggest foreign exchange earner after sugar at an
estimated dlrs 200 million a year _ have declined from dlrs 400 to
dlrs 290 per ounce.
	   Omai Gold Mines, the country's biggest, says most of its income
is coming from futures contracts negotiated before the latest
decline.
	   ``We can't do that all the time,'' said Omai spokeswoman Seeta
Mohamed. ``It will eventually catch up with us in the long run.''
	   Southeast Asia's financial crisis, meanwhile, cut demand for
Guyanese rain forest timber, much of it harvested by Asian firms.
With industry sales expected to drop 35 percent this year, local
producer A. Mazaharally and Sons says it doesn't have an overseas
order for the first time in memory.
	   As nervous investors sent earnings abroad, the Guyanese dollar
fell from 140 per U.S. dollar in December to 164. The Central Bank
intervened last month, spending dlrs 15 million from its dlrs 300
million in reserves to support the local dollar, which has
stabilized at about 150 but is selling at 159 on the black market.
	   Jagan recently blamed the downturn on continuing obstacles to
foreign investment, including customs delays and the bureaucratic
obstacles faced by foreigners wanting to lease land. Go Invest, a
quasi-governmental agency, will analyze those issues, said Finance
Minister Bharrat Jagdeo.
	   More is needed, warned Aubrey Norton, general secretary of
Hoyte's opposition People's National Congress.
	   ``If we don't have new investment, it means that we don't have
new money in the system. The absence of a proper investment policy
has affected the country,'' Norton said.

	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Hammacher chief executive Richard Tinberg watches
an employee race toward his office, yelling and arms waving in the
air.
	   Time to call security?
	   Nope. Time to start planning a new Hammacher Schlemmer catalog.
For 150 years, the Chicago-based company has specialized in finding
and selling those hard-to-find, must-have gizmos and gadgets.
	   Need a two-person submarine, a Hovercraft or a blimp? Look no
further. Credit Hammacher for selling the first pop-up toaster;
food processor; electric blender; Mr. Coffee, the first home-drip
coffee maker; portable radio and much more.
	   ``It's a really product-driven business and you have to
continually search every avenue to find the best and the most
innovative products,'' says Bill Booth, president of the
Chicago-based company. ``We're good at introducing items, finding
the first consumer version of an item, but then when it becomes
very common, we kind of move on.''
	   Booth and Tinberg probably are responsible for many an employee
headache, dreaming up ideas for new catalog items and challenging
product managers to find them by traveling the world trade shows,
searching the Internet, calling vendors, scouring magazines,
sponsoring inventor competitions.
	   ``Oh, initially, there is a lot of grumbling because they know
they'll spend weeks doing research,'' Booth says. ``Then at the
end, they come running through the door and say 'Eureka! I've found
them: a set of lights that never burn out!' ''
	   The company celebrated its long history last month (October) in
New York, where it opened its doors in 1848 as a hardware store in
the Bowery neighborhood. It expanded to Chicago and Beverly Hills,
California, and had sales through the Internet and one of the
oldest nationwide catalogs, introduced in 1881 _ six years before
Sears, Roebuck's ``Big Book.''
	   An exhibit featuring some of the original items Hammacher has
helped introduce will include the steam iron, electric dry shaver,
electric toothbrush and cordless phone and what those products
might look like in the future. The exhibit will later head to
Chicago and Beverly Hills.
	   To be sure, customers of the day weren't getting any of those
items cheap. A two-slice Toastmaster pop-up toaster would set you
back dlrs 17.50 in 1930; a pocket calculator, dlrs 149.50. And if
you had dlrs 21,000 or so to spare (plus change for shipping and
handling), a Hovercraft could have been yours a few years back. For
27 customers, it was.
	   Peter Alschuler, visiting from Frankfurt, Germany, browsed
Hammacher's Chicago store recently, chuckling as he walked along
with his girlfriend.
	   ``It's funny; I see I can get some things here that no one else
has,'' he said, pointing at a Norwegian sweater made for the 2002
Olympics. ``This seems like the store for buying for someone who
has everything.''
	   But even people who have everything have turned their nose up at
certain items, at least initially.
	   A commercial videotaping machine introduced before Sony's
now-defunct Betamax had few takers. A personal computer introduced
before Apple's Macintosh made home computers hot also received a
cool reception.
	   ``But the thing to note,'' Tinberg says, ``is that these were
introduced at very high price points and not widely available,
making us slightly ahead of our time. Many homes nowadays would be
lost without those devices.''

Some U.S. businesses warming to global treaty cutting emissions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By H. JOSEF HEBERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The debate over global warming cuts both ways
for United Technologies, one of America's largest corporations.
	   Reducing heat-trapping greenhouse gases may be a boon to its air
conditioning and hydrogen fuel cell business, but its jet engine
subsidiary could face new regulations and possibly suffer.
	   Even so, the company with nearly dlrs 25 billion in sales has
become one of the growing number of large U.S. corporations
convinced it is better to address the thorny climate change issue,
rather than scorn it.
	   ``We hope that we can position ourselves to benefit, but we want
to be ready either way so we aren't harmed,'' explains Leslie
Carothers, United Technologies' vice president for environment.
	   As representatives from more than 160 nations meet in Buenos
Aires, Argentina, to map further global strategies on climate
change, one thing is clear: U.S. business no longer is in lockstep
opposition to action.
	   It represents a dramatic shift within the business community
that many environmentalists and senior White House officials view
as critical in getting the controversial climate agreement reached
in Kyoto, Japan, a year ago, eventually accepted by the U.S.
Congress.
	   ``While many in Congress still want to ignore the mounting
evidence of global warming, many in the business community are
paying heed,'' Vice President Al Gore said at a recent White House
meeting with business leaders.
	   Fossil-fuel industries and utilities have not eased their attack
on the Kyoto proposal, which would require the United States to cut
greenhouse emissions _ mostly carbon dioxide from burning fossil
fuels _ by more than one-third beginning in 2008.
	   But a growing number of companies, including some automakers,
utilities and oil and chemical producers, abandoned the strictly
negative stand they've had for years.
	   ``There clearly is a splintering of the business community,''
says Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists, who has
followed the climate debate for environmentalists for more than a
decade.
	   That isn't to say these companies necessarily embrace the
mandatory timetable for cutting heat-trapping emissions under the
Kyoto pact.
	   ``They consider it a work in progress,'' says Eileen Claussen,
executive director of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change.
``But they recognize the reality that more has to be done.''
	   Twenty major U.S. corporations, including powers in the
chemical, oil, utility and manufacturing industries, have joined
with the Pew Center to promote actions to address climate change.
	   They include DuPont, Boeing, Weyerhaeuser, Lockheed-Martin,
American Electric Power, United Technologies, Enron and Sun Oil.
Many, including British Petroleum, have committed to specific
carbon emission reductions.
	   While not part of the group, General Motors Corp. said recently
it also accepts the need for some action to cut greenhouse gases,
although the automaker still strongly opposes the Kyoto agreement.
	   The globalization of U.S. companies also has forced many to take
a fresh look. The U.S. Big Three automakers, for example, are
seeing Europeans and Japanese manufacturers embracing the shift to
more environmentally friendly vehicles.

Prince Charles launches his own website
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ There's further proof that Britain's monarchy is
modernizing: Prince Charles has launched his own Internet website.
	   Spread across 354 pages, it contains biographical information
about the heir to the throne, who turns 50 on Saturday, and will be
updated regularly with news and pictures, his office announced
Tuesday.
	   The site is divided into sections covering Charles' life, his
work and an Online Forum page which will highlight issues of
particular interest to Queen Elizabeth II's eldest son. His
speeches and a schedule of upcoming appearances will also be
included.
	   ''This site provides us with a powerful way of getting across _
in an unfiltered way _ information about the prince,'' said Stephen
Lamport, Charles' private secretary.
	   ''We hope it will help people to understand the Prince of
Wales's work.''
	   The site is linked to the official Buckingham Palace website,
which was set up in March 1997. It has become one of the most
popular Internet sites with more than 100 million ``hits'' in its
first year.
	   Charles' site has been produced by PA New Media, a division of
the British news agency Press Association.
	   ``The prince recognizes the value of the Internet as a new way
of communicating with people and raising issues close to his
heart,'' said Mark Hird, Press Association's new media director.
	   The new site is at www.princeofwales.gov.uk.

Tyson expected to announce comeback fight next week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Mike Tyson is expected to make his return to
the ring official next week.
	   A news conference has been tentatively set in New York for Tyson
to announce he will fight on Jan. 16 at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las
Vegas.
	   The opponent still hasn't been signed, but South Africa's
Francois Botha remains the front-runner. If Tyson's handlers can't
come to terms with Botha in the next few days, they will turn to
either Vaughn Bean or Denmark's Brian Nielsen.
	   ``It will probably be Botha, but that's not certain yet,'' Tyson
adviser Shelly Finkel said Monday.
	   Finkel said he expects to hold a news conference next Tuesday in
New York to formally announce the latest comeback by the former
heavyweight champion.
	   Tyson, who won his boxing license back last month from Nevada
boxing authorities, will make millions once again in what will be
his first fight in 20 months. He had his license taken away for
biting Evander Holyfield's ears in his last bout.
	   Tyson needs the money, despite having made more than dlrs 100
million in the ring since getting out of prison in 1995. He is in
financial trouble and the IRS has a dlrs 13 million lien on his
property for failing to pay taxes.
	   Just how much Tyson will make for his first fight back since
biting Holyfield is still a matter of speculation, but it is
expected to easily exceed the amount he owes the IRS. Tyson's
official purse for his prior comeback in August 1995 against Peter
McNeeley was dlrs 25 million, although the boxer ended up with only
half of that.
	   The Jan. 16 fight will be shown on U.S. pay-per-view television,
and executive producer Jay Larkin expects it to do extremely well.
	   ``He has lost his last two fights, yet he probably commands more
focus and attention than any fighter in history,'' Larkin said.
``This is an individual who, for better or ill, has surpassed his
sport.''
	   The fight is expected to be promoted by Dan Goosen, head of
America Presents, who said last week he had signed to promote
Tyson's comeback.

<TEXT>
	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ Overwhelmed by disaster,
Central American leaders urged relief of their debts and a halt to
U.S. deportation of their people as a growing army of rescue
workers struggled to help hundreds of thousands of victims of
Hurricane Mitch.
	   At least 10,000 are reported dead _ 6,000 in Honduras alone.
	   Honduran President Carlos Flores Facusse called his country's
dlrs 4.2 billion debt ``unpayable'' following one of the worst
natural disasters of this century in the Americas.
	   ``In 72 hours, we lost what we had built, little by little, in
50 years,'' he told a news conference following a summit with other
Central American leaders in Comalapa, 25 miles (40 kms) south of
here.
	   The presidents asked for ``a plan of rehabilitation and
reconstruction'' for the region to be drawn up by the World Bank,
the International Monetary Fund, the Inter-American Development
Bank and the Central American Economic Integration Bank.
	   In a joint statement, they also asked the U.S. government to
negotiate a free trade agreement with the nations affected by Mitch
and appealed to the European Union to eliminate tariffs and duties
on their exports.
	   Some European leaders already were proposing debt relief,
echoing a call last week by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter.
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin on Monday urged a moratorium on
debt payments owed by countries hit.
	   German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer was also urging that
some debts be forgiven for Honduras and Nicaragua, which owes dlrs
6 billion.
	   Honduras' ambassador to the United states, Edgardo Dumas
Rodriguez, said in a radio interview Monday that the region
``urgently needs a massive aid program'' similar to the Marshall
Plan that helped Europe recover from World War II.
	   Government and independent relief organizations from around the
world were trying to rush aid to tens of thousands in Honduras and
Nicaragua isolated by ruptured roads, backed-up airports and too
few helicopters more than a week after the storm disappeared.
	   Hundreds of Hondurans swarmed around three U.S. Army Chinook
helicopters that delivered 32,000 pounds (14,500 kilograms) of food
and medicines Monday to a soccer field in Yoro, about 125
kilometers (80 miles) north of Tegucigalpa.
	   The town and surrounding area of 100,000 people lost
electricity, water and sewer systems to flooding of the Rio
Jalegua, and landslides cut access to the rest of the country by
land.
	   ``We are suffering in this town. We are incommunicado,'' said
farmer Raymundo Reyes, 50, as dozens of cheering children mobbed a
chopper pilot giving out gum and candy bars.
	   Chiquita Brands International, which owns or controls half of
Honduras' 50,000 acres (20,000 hectares) of banana farms, said most
of the farm sector has been destroyed and the banana industry has
come to a stop.
	   The company is contributing tens of millions of dollars in aid
and to rebuild infrastructure, said Steve Warshaw, Chiquita's
President and Chief Operating Officer.
	   The school year was canceled in the seven Honduran provinces hit
hardest by Mitch, which wiped out at least 315 schools, the
Education Ministry said.
	   Presidents Arnoldo Aleman of Nicaragua, Armando Calderon Sol of
El Salvador and Miguel Angel Rodriguez of Costa Rica met with
Flores Facusse at El Salvador's international airport for a quick
summit.
	   Guatemalan Foreign Minister Eduardo Stein also attended the
meeting, representing President Alvaro Arzu.
	   The presidents were trying to coordinate often-chaotic relief
efforts and to plan long-term priorities _ such as restoring
destroyed roads.
	   Flores Facusse also repeated a call for the United States to
postpone deportations of illegal immigrants to his country _
warning that without economic help, his people would have no choice
but to emigrate.
	   ``It is in the interests of the nations of the north that our
countries can be rehabilitated as soon as possible, because if they
cannot, people will seek new horizons,'' he said.
	   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service temporarily
suspended deportations of immigrants to Honduras and Guatemala as a
``humanitarian gesture'' until Tuesday.
	   In Honduras alone, 700,000 people will need food for the next
month, U.N. World Food Program representative Giuseppi Lubatti
estimated.
	   Canada began sending troops to the area on Monday. Britain said
it had some 1,40 Royal Navy and Royal Marines helping with relief
efforts in the region.
	   U.S. military engineers were helping repair roads, bridges and
water systems while moving relief supplies into the country.
	   Private charities were sending doctors into remote parts of
Honduras and Nicaragua.

New German leader to make inaugural speech
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Speech to start at 0800 GMT. &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Armed with a tax cut plan he says will
lower Germany's double-digit unemployment, Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder is giving the first major policy speech of his new
center-left government.
	   Like the Social Democrats' election campaign that unseated
longtime leader Helmut Kohl in September, Schroeder was expected to
focus Tuesday on his promise to put some 4 million jobless Germans
back to work.
	   His inaugural speech to the newly elected parliament marks the
start of Schroeder's effort to bring about change in Germany after
16 years of conservative rule under Kohl. Lawmakers are to start
considering the tax cut on Friday.
	   Schroeder is also expected to outline his most radical idea so
far: offering employees retirement at 60 with full benefits as a
way to open up jobs.
	   He warmed up to his overall theme at a convention of food
industry and restaurant workers Monday.
	   ``We must modernize our industrial society, otherwise it will
fall further and further behind _ but without economic and social
upheaval,'' he said.
	   He called on industry and labor to agree on ways to create jobs,
especially for young people, reviving a consensus model that helped
turn Germany into an economic powerhouse after World War II.
	   On Monday, the government presented a 15 billion mark (dlrs 8.9
billion) tax cut Monday, its first step toward tackling
unemployment.
	   An earlier version of the bill was overhauled after economists,
business leaders and the opposition criticized it as offering too
little tax relief and burdening small and medium-size companies.
	   The government says the proposal going to parliament Tuesday
will spur growth, create jobs and simplify Germany's complex tax
code.
	   Another project the government plans to introduce early in
parliament's four-year term is a law easing citizenship rules, seen
as a way to integrate foreigners.
	   Schroeder's Social Democrats and his junior coalition partner,
the ecology-minded Greens, have a 21-seat majority in parliament.

Temptation of millennium dollars raises Pacific rivalries
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT KEITH-REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SUVA, Fiji (AP) _ Plans to exploit turn-of-the-millennium
celebrations as a free global promotion for Pacific Island nations
have flopped, following the collapse1996 to coordinate millennium events
so as to avoid clashes and rivalries likely to undermine
promotional hopes.
	   Instead, rivalry for an anticipated flood of visitors to
countries located near the International Date Line at the 180th
meridian has completely undermined the South Pacific Millennium
Consortium, according to a report by the council.
	   Fiji, Tonga, Kiribati and Samoa are among Pacific nations which
are trying to capitalize on their location to claim they are among
the first places in the world to greet the year 2000 _ and, in the
case of countries east of the line, the last to bid farewell to
1999.
	   Turn-of-the-millennium planning in the Pacific includes
expectation of a massive influx of tourists and of global live
television coverage.
	   The council's report said the consortium had been ``throttled by
a number of influences.''
	   It said that in 1997 only 11 of 18 consortium members paid their
contributions to its budget. By August this year none had paid, and
work is being funded by unspent money from previous years and
T-shirt sales. The consortium had a Fiji dollars 788 (U.S. dlrs
394) bank overdraft.
	   Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, and the Cook Islands, all able to market
their Date Line locations as places offering opportunities to enter
2000 up to 12 hours ahead of the rest of the world and then skip
eastwards across the line, back a calendar day to enjoy a second
millennium eve, were ruthlessly selling themselves and treating
each other as rivals, the report says.
	   They were using their own Millennium logos instead of one that
the council had designed at a cost of Fiji dollars 20,000 (U.S.
dlrs 10,000).
	   Island countries further from the date line, including Vanuatu,
Tahiti and the Solomon Islands, saw no benefits from the consortium
and had distanced themselves from it, the report said.
	   Steven Yaqona, chief executive of the Fiji Visitors Bureau and
chairman of the Fiji Millennium Committee, admitted Tuesday: ``We
are all really competitors.''
	   Fiji is the only Pacific Island country to have the
International Date Line crossing its land. The line crosses the
territorial waters of other nations.
	   Fiji is organizing elaborate events it hopes will draw more
international attention to itself as the region's most popular
tourist destination, with about 380,000 visitors expected this
year.
	   Tonga's government has awarded a Millennium night event monopoly
to Saudi Arabian businessman Hussein Khashoggi, son of billionaire
arms dealer, Adnan Khashoggi.
	   He has released few details of his event but claims it will be
``something so big, so large and so special that it cannot be
ignored by the rest of the world.''

Rightist militia brutally massacres 11 peasants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Rightist militiamen using chainsaws on
their victims killed 11 peasants and kidnapped 13 others, accusing
them of collaborating with leftist guerrillas, police said.
	   The group calling itself R-20 carried out the killings Monday in
two rural hamlets in Vegachi, a town in central Antioquia state
about 155 miles (250 kilometers) northeast of Bogota, a state
police spokesman told The Associated Press.
	   A female guerrilla desertor led the killers to their victims,
said the spokesman, who requested anonymity.
	   He said the paramilitary group killed 6 people in the first of
the villages, known as La Mona, then killed 5 people several hours
later in the other hamlet, Santa Isabel.
	   The chainsaws were used to torture and behead several of the
victims, whereas others were shot dead.
	   Conflictive Antioquia state is home to paramilitary groups and
rival leftist guerrillas vying for control. The two rarely clash
directly, but frequently threaten or kill civilians they suspect of
supporting the other side.
	   The rightist militias are accused by human rights of the
majority of rights abuses committed currently in Colombia's civil
war.

Dollar sharply higher against yen, Japanese stocks lower
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was sharply higher against the yen
Tuesday morning, while Japanese stocks slipped on disappointment
over reported contents of the government's new economic package.
	   The dollar bought 121.62 yen, up 2.26 yen from late Monday in
Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 121.57 yen
overnight.
	   The U.S. currency was stable following its overnight climb in
New York, where it soared to its highest level in more than a month
against both the Deutsche mark and yen on increasing global
financial optimism.
	   In Tokyo, exporters were waiting to sell the greenback to take
profits earned overseas, while institutional investors were selling
it to hedge against a potential fall, traders said.
	   Stock prices fell after details of the government's upcoming
economic package, to be officially announced Monday, were reported
in the Nihon Keizai newspaper Tuesday morning.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average slipped 27.51
points, or 0.19 percent, to 14,167.03 points in the first 30
minutes of morning trading. On Monday, the index had gained 72.57
points, or 0.51 percent.
	   The Nihon Keizai reported in a front-page story that the
emergency economic stimulus package will aim for economic growth in
fiscal year 1999, which begins April 1, and a full-fledged recovery
in fiscal 2000.
	   Investors, however, interpreted the report as suggesting that
the government package is unlikely to come up with a clear policy
to improve market sentiment, traders said.
	   ``Investors now feel they can't expect a lot from the
measures,'' said Masaru Arai, general manager of the stock division
at Ryoko Securities.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 2.52 points, or 0.23 percent, to 1,081.64.
The TOPIX fell 5.31 points, or 0.49 percent, the previous day.
	   Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average
dropped 77.50 points _ or 0.8 percent _ to 8,897.96 on Monday.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 0.840 percent from Monday's finish of 0.825 percent,
driving its price down to 108.52 yen from 108.67 yen.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ U.S.-donated airplanes that fumigate
illegal drug crops will steer clear of a Switzerland-sized area
where peace talks are planned between the government and leftist
rebels, officials said Monday.
	   Ceding to a guerrilla security request, President Andres
Pastrana last week withdrew all troops and police from a
16,200-square-mile (42,000 square kilometer) region where
negotiations are expected soon with the rebel Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia.
	   The 90-day pullout applies to five guerrilla-contested towns
where police estimate as much as 30 percent of Colombia's coca _
the plant used to make cocaine _ is grown.
	   U.S. Republican lawmakers have questioned the move, threatening
a cutoff in anti-narcotics aid if the military pullout forces
cutbacks in anti-drug operations.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ A foreign human rights mission began a
five-day visit to Peru on Monday to study alleged human rights
abuses despite receiving death threats apparently designed to block
the visit.
	   The six-member delegation from the Washington-based
Inter-American Human Rights Commission met with President Alberto
Fujimori and Justice Minister Alfredo Quispe Monday. The group
didn't comment on the meetings.
	   Three mission members then went to the city of Ayacucho, 230
miles (370 kilometers) southeast of Lima, to visit prisons used to
hold leftist rebels and common prisoners.
	   The remaining members met with Peruvian human rights groups in
the capital Lima. The mission has set up an office in a Lima hotel
to receive complaints of human rights abuses.
	   Prior to the visit, commission President Carlos Alaya said
members of the mission had received death threats from a group
calling itself the April 5th Commandos.
	   April 5, 1992 was the date Fujimori shut down Peru's Congress
and judicial system with military backing in what became known as
his ``self-coup.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ The Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia wants to open an office in Brazil, similar to ones it has
in several other countries, one of its leaders told a local
newspaper.
	   ``We want Brazil to get to know us better,'' rebel leader Hernan
Ramirez told the Jornal do Brasil newspaper in a Monday story. ``We
want Brazil to know that we are not linked to drug traffickers and
that we're not a band of kidnappers.''
	   FARC, Colombia's largest and oldest rebel group, already has
offices in Venezuela, Mexico, Argentina, Ecuador and Spain, he
said.
	   Ramirez said he had already met with Congressman Neiva Moreira,
president of the Chamber of Deputies' Foreign Relations Committee,
and with congressman Tuga Angerami.

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Former international fugitive Phillip
Harold Bell was found not guilty Tuesday on one of 38 child sex
offenses for which he is being tried.
	   District Court Judge Thomas Davidson directed a jury foreman on
to hand down the verdict after prosecutors closed their case on all
of the charges.
	   The judge said no evidence had been given relating to a charge
that Bell had oral sex with a boy aged between 10 and 18 between
July 1985 and 1987 on a boat off a Sydney beach.
	   ``Accordingly there can only be one verdict ... not guilty,''
Davidson said.
	   Bell, 62, has pleaded innocent to 38 sexual offenses involving
five boys in their early teens during the mid 1980s. The trial is
continuing on the remaining 37 charges.
	   Bell was arrested last December in South Africa after fleeing
Australia. An international search lasting over a year found him
running a surfing school at Jeffrey's Bay, on South Africa's
southern coast.
	   Bell was extradited back to Australia after spending nearly five
months in jail near Port Elizabeth.
	   Last month, chief prosecutor Mark Tedeschi said Bell had preyed
on vulnerable youths for his own sexual gratification, enticing
them with offers of cash for odd jobs and showering them with gifts
and privileges in return for sexual favors.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Rightist militiamen using chainsaws on

them of collaborating with leftist guerrillas, police said.

	   The rightist militias are accused by human rights of the

	   Hoping to spur peace talks to end the conflict, President Andres
Pastrana last weekend cleared all troops from a massive
rebel-contested area where negotiations are expected soon with
Colombia's largest guerrilla group.
	   Dismantling the rightist militias and severing their alleged
ties to the army is a top rebel demand.
	   Pastrana has indicated, however, that he will seek separate
negotiations to persuade the militias to disarm.

People's forum opens in opposition to APEC summit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOCELYN GECKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Activists opposed to the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum's emphasis on trade
descended on Malaysia Tuesday to open an alternative forum expected
to criticize the APEC agenda.
	   The Asia-Pacific People's Assembly, billing itself as anti-APEC,
condemns the business-dominated agenda of the group, which aims to
reduce trade barriers among its 21 members.
	   More than 500 activists from labor unions and social-action
groups around the world are expected to attend the Nov. 10-15
People's Summit, sponsored by the assembly.
	   They plan to discuss human rights, the environment, poverty and
other issues they say are getting overlooked in the rush toward
globalization.
	   ``We are calling on the APEC leaders to say that human rights
are a part of the economic process, part of the APEC process and it
cannot be excluded,'' said Tim Parritt of London-based Amnesty
International.
	   While APEC meetings in the past have focused on trade, the
regional economic crisis is expected to dominate the Nov. 17-18
summit. Preparatory meetings among officials and ministers begin
Thursday.
	   With trade barriers dropping and new markets opening, those
paying the price are migrant laborers in sweatshops and indigenous
peoples displaced from their land, a People's Summit statement
said.
	   The alternative summit will highlight the worsening social
effects caused by the plunging Asian economies that have forced
millions into unemployment and poverty.
	   ``You cannot divorce economic rights from political and civil
rights,'' said U.N. Rapporteur Param Cumaraswamy.
	   A ceremony on the opening day was planned to commemorate the
50th anniversary of the United Nation's Universal Declaration of
Human Rights.
	   Speeches and workshops were expected to be held throughout the
five-day summit, which will finish off with an anti-APEC
demonstration, organizers said.
	   Recent political events in Malaysia threatened to add further
fuel to the human rights rally. Malaysia, the APEC-host country,
came under worldwide criticism after the Sept. 20 arrest of former
deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim. He later appeared in court
with a black eye he said came from police beatings.
	   Anwar's ouster sparked unprecedented anti-government rallies in
the capital, Kuala Lumpur. His trial on corruption and sexual
misconduct began Nov. 2 and will pause Nov. 14, once APEC gets
underway. He has pleaded innocent to all charges.
	   Lim Kit Siang, the opposition leader in Parliament, said the
events capped ``a great year of embarrassment for human rights in
Malaysia.''
	   He urged Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad to use APEC to reassure
the world of Malaysia's commitment to human rights.
	   APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua
New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the
United States. Russia, Vietnam and Peru will join this year.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Rightist militiamen using chainsaws on
their victims killed 11 peasants and kidnapped 13 others, accusing
them of collaborating with leftist guerrillas, police said.
	   The group calling itself R-20 carried out the killings Monday in
two rural hamlets near Vegachi, a town in central Antioquia state
about 155 miles (250 kilometers) northeast of Bogota, a state
police spokesman told The Associated Press.
	   A female guerrilla deserter led the killers to their victims,
said the spokesman, who requested anonymity.
	   He said the paramilitary group killed 6 people in the first of
the villages, known as La Mona, then killed 5 people several hours
later in the other hamlet, Santa Isabel.
	   Police said the chainsaws were used to torture and behead
several of the victims. Others were shot to death.
	   Ten of the victims were men, police reported. The slain woman, a
minor, was killed by militiamen seeking her husband, who was not at
home.
	   Conflictive Antioquia state is home to paramilitary groups and
rival leftist guerrillas vying for control. The two rarely clash
directly, but frequently threaten or kill civilians they suspect of
supporting the other side.
	   The rightist militias are accused by human rights groups of the
majority of rights abuses committed currently in Colombia's civil
war.
	   Hoping to spur peace talks to end the conflict, President Andres
Pastrana last weekend cleared all troops from a massive
rebel-contested area where negotiations are expected soon with
Colombia's largest guerrilla group.
	   Dismantling the rightist militias and severing their alleged
ties to the army is a top rebel demand.
	   Pastrana has indicated, however, that he will seek separate
negotiations to persuade the militias to disarm.

Haitian president, Spanish foreign minister visit Cuba
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Once seemingly isolated, Cuba welcomed two
significant foreign visitors: Spain's Foreign Minister Abel Matutes
and Haitian President Rene Preval.
	   Matutes is the highest-level Spanish official to visit Cuba
since conservative Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar took office in
May 1996 and began sharply criticizing Cuba's human rights
situation.
	   The visit is part of a steady improvement in Cuban relations
with Spain _ its top European trading partner _ which hit bottom in
November 1996 when Cuba rejected Spain's proposed ambassador and
officials traded insults.
	   ``I am enchanted to visit Cuba,'' Matutes said on arrival Monday
evening at Havana's international airport, where he was met by
Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina, according to local reporters.
	   ``I am convinced that this visit will serve to increase the ties
between two brother peoples,'' added Matutes, who had met Robaina
twice in Spain over the past 13 months.
	   Among the topics of the trip is an even more symbolic visit:
that of King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia, who are expected to come
to Cuba before an Ibero-American summit in October in Havana.
	   Matutes also was likely to discuss Cuba's 1 billion peseta (dlrs
7 million) debt to Spain and was to sign an agreement on
anti-narcotics cooperation.
	   Preval's six-day visit comes at a time of warming Cuban
relations with its Caribbean neighbors, who have chafed at U.S.
efforts to prod them into isolating Cuba.
	   In August, President Fidel Castro toured once-hostile Caribbean
countries and attended a 16-nation Caribbean summit.
	   Meanwhile, Cuban officials said their country would quickly
embrace the new European currency, the Euro, which is due to be
used in 11 of 15 members of the European Union as of January.
	   Juventud Rebrrounding its heavy dependence on the U.S. dollar _
such as international clearance of payments.
	   The newspaper noted that 44 percent of Cuba's trade and most of
its credits are with European countries or institutions.
	   It said that as of July, Cuba would denominate all contracts
with Euro-using countries in Euros. It is to do the same in those
with China, Vietnam and North Korea as of January 2000.

Serb police threaten to been up patrols after two officers slain

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police are threatening to beef
up their patrols in Kosovo following the slaying of two officers
Serbs blame on ethnic Albania guerrillas.
	   Ethnic Albanians accuse Serbs of opening fire first on a group
of their men _ and of violating a U.S.-brokered cease-fire intended
to halt hostilities between Serbs and the ethnic Albanians who make
up 90 percent of Kosovo's population.
	   Violence by both sides has increased in the past week, including
at least three incidents in which police reported killing KLA
fighters who shot at them first.
	   The policemen _ Ilija Vujosevic and Dejan Djatlov _ disappeared
Friday, the same day Serb police shot to death five ethnic Albanian
guerrillas, including a commander of two divisions.
	   Both of the slain policemen had gunshot wounds to the head,
indicating they had been killed execution-style. Serb police
spokesman Bozidar Filic said the executions showed the Kosovo
Liberation Army's utter disregard for the U.S.-sponsored
cease-fire.
	   He warned that unless ```international representatives'' secure
two main roads running through Malisevo by Wednesday, police will
increase their patrols and ``allow safe passage'' _ indicating a
possible new Serb action.
	   David Scheffer, the roving U.S. ambassador on war crimes issues,
viewed the bodies in Malisevo, a devastated central village, as he
toured the area with the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission, or
KDOM.
	   ``This represents one of the problems that is being experienced
here with the cease-fire, and that is that there are violations of
the cease fire by both sides,'' Scheffer said.
	   Serb authorities suspect the killed policemen were kidnapped by
the KLA in retaliation for the shootings of the five guerrillas.
	   The rebels say police shot at the five as they drove in two
vehicles from Opterusa village, while police claim the guerrillas
opened fire first.
	   Qamil Hajrizi, the father of one of the slain guerrillas, said
Monday that his son's body was riddled with bullets.
	   ``From what I saw, they were certainly ambushed,'' he said after
waiting about four hours to collect the body from a hospital morgue
in the southern city of Prizren. ``He was destroyed by many, many
bullets.''
	   A KLA official called the killing of the five guerrillas an
ambush that violated a de facto cease-fire in Kosovo. Under a
4-week-old agreement between Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, Milosevic's forces were supposed
to cease hostilities.
	   Dozens of Serb police were killed before and after the start of
a Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists last February in
Kosovo, a majority Albanian province. Several hundred other people,
mostly ethnic Albanians, have been killed, and as many as 300,000
driven from their homes.
	   In Geneva, the International Committee of the Red Cross said it
is visiting some 160 people held by Yugoslav authorities and is
expected to visit more by the end of the week. Under the
verification agreement reached with Yugoslav officials, the ICRC
has a mandate to visit prisoners being held by Yugoslav
authorities, spokeswoman Amanda Williamson said.
	   The ICRC is also following some 120 cases of people reportedly
abducted by the KLA, but has not received much solid information on
them.

Dollar rises against yen, Japanese stocks advance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with midday trading &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen Tuesday
morning as strong sentiment carried through from overseas spurred
dollar-buying. Japanese stocks moved higher in thin trading.
	   The dollar bought 122.38 yen in midday trading, up 3.02 yen from
late Monday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of
121.57 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 47.60
points, or 0.34 percent, to finish the morning session at
14,242.14. On Monday, the index had gained 72.57 points, or 0.51
percent.
	   In currency trading, the dollar climbed to its highest level
against the yen in over a month as Japanese trust banks led the
buying spree, traders said.
	   The dollar managed to push through resistance both around 122.00
yen and the overnight high of 122.20 yen, triggering some stop-loss
buying that sent it to an intraday high of 122.70 yen, its highest
level since early October.
	   Traders said the dollar-buying was prompted by a growing notion
that the U.S. Federal Reserve is unlikely to cut interest rates at
its upcoming meeting on Nov. 17.
	   In addition, mounting tension over the standoff between the
United Nations and Iraq is leading to safe-haven flows into the
U.S. currency, they said.
	   Iraq has stopped cooperating with the U.N. inspection team that
searches for chemical and biological weapons, and the United States
is considering options, including air strikes, to force Baghdad to
comply.
	   On the stock market, share prices were slightly lower earlier in
the session, but later headed into positive territory in thin
trading on buying of export-oriented issues amid the weakening
trend of the yen against the dollar.
	   A strong dollar tends to increase earnings of Japanese exporters
when they repatriate overseas profits into yen.
	   Trading remained thin as many institutional investors avoided
taking positions before the government maps out economic stimulus
measures on Nov. 16.
	   The Nihon Keizai newspaper reported in a front-page story
Tuesday that the government's upcoming emergency economic stimulus
package will aim for economic growth in fiscal year 1999, which
begins April 1, and a full-fledged recovery in fiscal 2000.
	   Japan's economy is currently in recession.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 1.94 points, or 0.18 percent, to 1,086.10. The
TOPIX fell 5.31 points, or 0.49 percent, the previous day.
	   Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average
dropped 77.50 points _ or 0.8 percent _ to 8,897.96 on Monday.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 0.835 percent from Monday's finish of 0.825 percent,
driving its price down to 108.57 yen from 108.67 yen.

World Bank president: South Korea and Thailand coming back
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOSEPH COLEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ South Korea and Thailand are over the worst of the
Asian economic crisis, but grinding poverty still stands in the way
of recovery in Indonesia, the president of the World Bank said
Tuesday.
	   ``We've come a long way in Korea and Thailand in building the
economic and financial base ... to try to stabilize the economic
situation,'' James Wolfensohn told reporters in Tokyo.
	   The two countries have largely overcome the ``worst excesses''
of problems of interest rates, foreign reserves and lack of credit,
he said.
	   Indonesia, however, is making slower progress, in part because
it was poorer than South Korea and Thailand before the Asian
financial crisis hit last year, Wolfensohn said.
	   For example, 60 million Indonesians are surviving on just dlrs 2
a day, while another 15 million scrape by on a daily budget of dlr
1 or less, he said. Private debt to foreign creditors also totals
dlrs 60 billion.
	   ``It's quite hard with that background to make an immediate jump
forward,'' he said.
	   Despite those problems, Wolfensohn said the monetary and
financial situations in Indonesia are ``being brought into a better
alignment.''
	   Wolfensohn, scheduled to go to Russia on Thursday, was in Japan
for talks with government officials on approaches to the expanding
global economic slowdown. On Monday he met with Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi and Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura.
	   The World Bank chief and Komura agreed that a comprehensive
strategy is needed to assist developing nations on social and
structural reforms for longer-term stability, a Foreign Ministry
official said.
	   On Tuesday, Wolfensohn said that while the macroeconomic
indicators of crisis-hit countries have received the most
attention, the bank is intent on focusing on underlying structural
problems.
	   He listed World Bank goals in many developing countries as
instituting transparent financial and justice systems and improving
education, health and rural infrastructure.
	   ``If you don't have that, you will not get social stability, and
... you will not have a restoration of confidence,'' Wolfensohn
said. ``People do not invest in countries where they're likely to
get knocked off by something.''
	   He said it was likely that developing countries would resort to
greater reliance on government budget deficit financing to
stimulate their economies and attract foreign capital.

Government: Singapore slips into recession
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's economy shrank for the second
consecutive quarter, a sign that the country has slipped into a
recession, the Ministry of Trade and Industry said Tuesday.
	   Singapore's gross domestic product contracted by 0.7 percent in
the third quarter, compared with a year earlier. This is the first
time that the economy has shrunk on the year-on-year basis since
the first quarter of 1986.
	   The government also revised the economic growth forecast for
1998 to 0.5 percent to 1 percent, down from an earlier forecast of
0.5 to 1.5 percent. It predicted the economy in 1999 will hover
between a 1.0 percent contraction and 1.0 percent growth.
	   The economy grew by 7.8 percent in 1997. Though the economic
crisis hit Southeast Asia in July 1997, it took time for
reverberations to reach affluent Singapore.
	   ``The external economic environment has deteriorated measurably
in the past few months,'' the ministry said.
	   ``Although some stability has returned to most Asian economies
following more signs of reform implementation ... economic
contractions are likely to take a protracted period to work
themselves out,'' it added.
	   The ministry cited the Russian ``economic stalemate'' and
problems in Latin America, which are putting pressure on investors
in developing countries.
	   Recent cuts in interest rates could help the situation, it said.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong earlier said he expects a
further contraction in the fourth quarter.
	   Detailing the economy in the third quarter, the ministry said
the manufacturing sector shrank by 4.5 percent following a decline
of 0.5 percent in the second quarter, while the finance sector grew
by 1.7 percent, down from 2.4 percent growth in the second.
	   The construction sector grew by 1.1 percent in the third
quarter, much slower than the 9.8 percent growth registered in the
second.
	   The retail sector declined by 6.0 percent after a decline of 4.7
percent in the second quarter. Transportation and communications
grew by 3.2 percent after expanding by 5.6 percent in the second
quarter.

Japanese crayon maker stops using `skin' color after criticism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Complaints from consumer groups and teachers have
forced Japan's top crayon maker to change the name of its ``skin
color'' crayon to ``pale orange,'' the company said Tuesday.
	   Pentel Co., which controls 45 percent of the Japanese crayon and
paint market, has received a growing number of calls saying the
name implied that human skin only comes in one shade, said
spokesman Haruo Maki.
	   ``We had mixed opinions even within the company,'' Maki said.
``But we decided it would be best to change it.''
	   The company has begun printing new labels and boxes of crayons
and water colors since April, aiming to replace the current stock
by next year, Maki said.
	   Japan's 18 crayon and water color makers have long used the term
``skin color'' under government guidelines. But the requirement
will be removed by December as part of deregulation, Maki said.
	   Color experts say the color was actually much lighter than the
skin tone of most Japanese.
	   ``We have felt awkward telling children that was the color of
their skin,'' Yoshimitsu Kiyono, head of a group of elementary
school art teachers, was quoted by the Yomiuri newspaper. ``Human
skin can be any color, and we want children to learn to mix
different colors freely.''

Sri Lanka to trade 4 million kilograms of tea for Iraqi oil
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lanka is planning to trade 4
million kilograms (8.8 million pounds) of tea for Iraqi oil, a
newspaper said Tuesday.
	   Quoting unnamed officials, The Island said a formal agreement
will be signed later this year. Any food-for-oil deal by Iraq must
be endorsed by the United Nations under the terms of an embargo on
Baghdad for its 1990 invasion of neighboring Kuwait.
	   The agreement to sell Sri Lankan tea came during a visit by a
Sri Lankan ministerial delegation to Baghdad last week. The visit
was the first since the 1990 Gulf War.
	   Tea is Sri Lanka's lifeline, bringing in hard currency that the
government needs to keep the economy going and fight separatist
Tamil rebels.
	   Sri Lanka produced 276.8 million kilograms (608.9 million
pounds) of tea in 1997-1998, the highest ever recorded.
	   The government exported 268 million kilograms (589.6 million
pounds) in 1997-98, earning 42.5 billion rupees (dlrs 807 million).
	   The government's privatization program launched in 1995 has
boosted tea yields through improved husbandry and better
management. The government has sold 51 percent of 19 plantations,
and now has majority control in just three large plantations.

 &UR; Montreal Canadiens beat Philadelphia Flyers 5-1

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Two goals by Brian Savage sparked the Montreal
Canadiens to a 5-1 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers Monday
night.
	   Martin Rucinsky, Turner Stevenson and Shayne Corson also scored
for the Canadiens (6-5-2), who scored on their first three shots on
goal and now have won three in a row.
	   Alexander Daigle scored the lone goal for the Flyers (5-5-4),
who have gone winless in their last six (0-4-2).
 &UR; Islanders 3, Maple Leafs 1 &QC; 
	   In Toronto, Toronto goaltender Curtis Joseph gave up three goals
on six shots in the third period as New York beat Toronto.
	   The Maple Leafs outshot the Islanders 39-19 for the game, but
New York goalie Tommy Salo was superb as the Islanders ended a
two-game losing streak.
	   All the goals came in the third period, with Gino Odjick's third
of the season snapping a 1-1 tie. Kevin Miller's centering pass
deflected off Odjick's skate past Joseph at 7:21 of the third
period.
	   Claude Lapointe and Sergei Nemchinov had the other Islanders'
goals, while Dimitri Yushkevich replied for Toronto.
