IN UPPER MANHATTAN, SAMMY SOSA RULES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ These days, it is almost impossible to wander around
Washington Heights without hearing the name Sosa on every block, in
every store, in every apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   In front of a bodega on Thursday morning, for instance,
immigrants from the Dominican Republic grumbled that Sammy Sosa,
the Dominican-born baseball star for the Chicago Cubs, had received
far less attention than his slugging competitor, native-born Mark
McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   Inside a restaurant at lunch time, two Dominican immigrants who
were sitting at different tables suddenly started arguing about
which player was more powerful. ``McGwire muy fuerte,'' one man
pitched; ``No, Sosa tiene mas!'' another replied.
</P>
<P>
   On the hot asphalt of West 170th Street near Audubon Avenue,
just before dinner time, a boy, wearing a turned-around Chicago
Cubs cap and carrying a baseball bat, bellowed: ``I'm Sosa! I'm
Sosa!''
</P>
<P>
   And Sammy Sosa didn't even play on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As McGwire and Sosa raced to eclipse Roger Maris' record of 61
home runs in a single season, Sosamania has reached a fevered pitch
in this slice of upper Manhattan, which, with perhaps 150,000
Dominicans, represents the largest cluster of Dominicans in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   But the obsession is more than just a whimsical dance with
sports history. For the Dominicans, Sosa's pursuit is also a story
about a local boy who stands for all that can be good in their
beleaguered homeland, a national hero whose every home run seems to
validate an entire people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can escape the politics and the problems, because we are
all proud of Sosa,'' said Leonardo Ivan Dominguez, a dance
instructor who works for Alianza Dominicana, a social service
agency in Washington Heights. ``He's a hero, and he's going to be
the whole mirror for the kids in his country.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, in true patriotic fashion, the Dominicans also wonder
why McGwire has received so much more media coverage than Sosa,
even though they both have been in hot pursuit of the home run
record. After all, some contend, Sosa is carrying a team that is
vying for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Is it just because McGwire has led the home run race all year?
It it the distances of McGwire's towering shots? Or is it something
more conspiratorial?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always McGwire, McGwire, McGwire; there's too much
McGwire,'' complained Charles Rosario, who works at an electronics
store in Washington Heights. ``I think it's because McGwire is
American, and white, and Sosa is a Dominican, and black. Americans
want to see McGwire break the record.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Sosa is not the only star in a galaxy of outstanding
Dominican players. There is Pedro Martinez, the hard-throwing
pitcher for the Boston Red Sox; Moises Alou, the Houston Astros'
slugger, and Washington Heights' own Manny Ramirez, a cog of the
Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, it is Sosa who has captivated his countrymen, a
people as fanatical about baseball, perhaps, as the Brazilians are
about soccer.
</P>
<P>
   At the Latin Brothers Billiard hall in Washington Heights, fans
of Sosa's painted the words ``SOSA 56'' on the window Wednesday
night, his total at that point. But by the first inning of Friday
night's game between the Cubs and the Pittsburgh Pirates, Sosa had
made history, hitting his 57th home run and breaking the team's
68-year-old single-season record.
</P>
<P>
   At Peligro Sports, more than 200 Cubs caps have been sold in the
last month, and all the Sammy Sosa jerseys are sold out, said Jose
Rivas, a store manager. This time last year, by contrast, the store
would sell 20 Cubs caps a month _ maybe _ and didn't carry Sosa
jerseys.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When the Cubs are on television, people jam West Side Audio and
Electronics, on Broadway and 143rd Street. Sometimes the streets
seem to echo with applause and hoots when Sosa hits a home run,
said Anthony Rodriguez, the store's owner.
</P>
<P>
   Some Dominicans have altered their routines. Julian Reyes, 22,
who works at a brokerage firm in Queens, has concocted excuses to
skip out of work when the Cubs are on television. He also has
friends who have actually traveled to Chicago to watch Sosa in
person.
</P>
<P>
   Cira Rosa, whose 10-year-old son, Wilson, attended a baseball
camp this summer in the Dominican Republic, said that her son is so
engrossed by Sammy Sosa highlights on television and Sammy Sosa
articles in Sports Illustrated for Kids, that nothing else seems to
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``To take a shower, to eat; forget it with the baseball thing,''
Mrs. Rosa said, while watching her son playing baseball in an
alley, pretending to be No. 21 of the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   The scrutiny has intensified with each game. This weekend, the
Cubs continue their series with the Pirates, and McGwire's
Cardinals play the Cincinnati Reds in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Cubs visit the Cardinals in a much-anticipated
matchup that Dominican fans say they hope will give Sosa equal
billing with McGwire. McGwire has appeared on the cover of Sports
Illustrated three times and The New York Times Magazine once this
year, while Sosa has but one appearance on Sports Illustrated's
cover.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, there are plenty of Dominicans who, when prompted,
say they respect McGwire, a Paul Bunyan type of slugger whose home
runs are threats to any windows in the stadium's ZIP code.
</P>
<P>
   Some Dominicans feel that Sosa's success is an antidote to the
criticism endured by Felipe Lopez, the Dominican-American high
school basketball star from New York City who had an inconsistent
career at St. John's University. Sosa, they point out, has already
broken the record of 47 home runs by a Latin American-born player,
set by George Bell of the Toronto Blue Jays in 1987, and Juan
Gonzales of the Texas Rangers and Andres Galarraga of the Colorado
Rockies, both in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   No one can take that away from Sosa, or the community.
</P>
<P>
   But athletic prowess is not the only quality in Sosa that
Dominicans say they appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, 29, grew up poor in a sugar-mill town, San Pedro de
Macoris, selling oranges and shining shoes to make money, and using
a cardboard milk carton as a baseball glove. And while he was known
as a bit of hot dog early in his career, he has matured into one of
the best all-round players in the game. Through it all, Sosa, who
has one of the richest contracts in baseball, has been credited by
Dominicans for remaining humble, donating money to his hometown
each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a simple man, he helps the poor people and he's a good
example for little kids,'' said Reyes, the occasionally truant
brokerage-firm employee.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa is so popular, in fact, that many people in Washington
Heights said they would prefer to see the Cubs in the playoffs
instead of the Mets, as the two clubs fight for the National
League's wild-card spot. But there is a limit to the adulation.
</P>
<P>
   Like, who would people be rooting for if the Cubs faced the
Yankees in the World Series?
</P>
<P>
   ``Ooh, that's a tough one,'' said Reyes, recoiling as if someone
had asked him to choose between the cooking of his wife or his
mother. ``I got to feel for Sammy, but I'm a Yankees fan. We're
from New York, you know?''

SPIRLEA BEATS SERENA WILLIAMS AT OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also TEN-USOPEN-DAY) 
(mk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Irina Spirlea did Friday night what she could not do
last year at the U.S. Open: She beat a Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Playing on the same court where she lost to, and collided with,
Venus Williams in the 1997 semifinals, Spirlea shrugged off a
ferocious second set from the younger Williams sister, Serena, and
won 6-3, 0-6, 7-5. The tall and powerful Spirlea, seeded ninth,
will face Wimbledon champion Jana Novotna in the Round of 16.
Serena Williams will have to settle for watching her sister.
</P>
<P>
   Serena Williams, who was playing in her first U.S. Open, will
watch with some regrets. At 5-5 in the final set, she played a
mediocre game to lose her serve, knocking a relatively routine
backhand well long at 15-40 after Spirlea's return bounced high off
the net cord. Spirlea then held her serve to finish off her first
victory against Williams, who had beaten her in their two previous
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The postmatch handshake was hardly an embrace, but there was no
repeat of last year when Spirlea and Venus Williams bumped into
each other on a changeover and Spirlea used an expletive to
describe Williams in the postmatch news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what happened last year, the problems we had, are all
cleaned up,'' Spirlea said.

EDITORIAL: WHEN RAPE BECOMES GENOCIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Aug. 5:
</P>
<P>
   The guilty verdict the war crimes tribunal for Rwanda pronounced
on Jean-Paul Akayesu this week marked the first judgment for the
crime of genocide under international law. In making rape part of
Akayesu's genocide conviction, the decision also advances the
world's legal treatment of rape and sexual violence.
</P>
<P>
   Akayesu, who is due to be sentenced later this month, was not
accused of carrying out rapes or killings himself. Instead, the
court found that as mayor of the city of Taba in 1994, he ordered
Hutu to kill their Tutsi neighbors, including children. He also
encouraged and ordered the rape and murder of Tutsi women in a
cultural center he controlled.
</P>
<P>
   While Akayesu's conviction completed the first full trial for
genocide, a former Rwandan prime minister, Jean Kambanda, pleaded
guilty to genocide on May 1. On Friday he was sentenced to life in
prison, the maximum punishment at the tribunal. The greater impact
of the court's Akayesu decision will likely be seen in the area of
rape and sexual violence. The court declared that rape may
constitute genocide if committed with intent to destroy a
particular group. In this case, Tutsi women were raped to increase
their suffering before being killed. The court also issued the
first definition of rape under international law. It called rape
``a physical invasion of a sexual nature, committed on a person
under circumstances which are coercive.''
</P>
<P>
   Coercive circumstances need not include physical force, the
court said. Threats and intimidation would qualify. The definition
is concise and broad enough to be a good guide, enabling courts to
prosecute rape more easily in the future.
</P>
<P>
   When charges were first brought against Akayesu, rape was not
among them. Despite extensive media reports of rapes, the
tribunal's investigators, at the time virtually all men, could not
find evidence to support an indictment. But during the trial a
witness brought up rape in the cultural center. Questioned by
Navanethem Pillay, a South African who is the tribunal's only
female judge, the witness gave details. Other witnesses followed.
Largely due to pressure from women's groups, the investigators went
back to ask about rape, and those charges were added. Without
female judges and investigators, this cruel aspect of the Rwandan
genocide might never have been addressed.

<P>
   TORONTO _ A Royal Airlines Boeing 757 made an emergency landing
in Newfoundland on Friday after oil warning lights came on in the
cockpit and the pilot smelled fumes, airline officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, bound for Glasgow from Toronto and reported to be
carrying more than 200 people, landed safely at the Canadian Forces
base in Goose Bay, Newfoundland, about 4:30 a.m. local time, about
30 hours after a Swissair McDonnell Douglas MD-11 jetliner plunged
into the Atlantic Ocean five miles from Peggy's Cove, Nova Scotia,
killing all 229 people on board.
</P>
<P>
   Al Graham, chief operating officer for Royal Airlines, a charter
service based in Montreal, said the pilot landed the plane because
he could smell oil fumes in the cockpit and both the ``low oil
quantity'' and ``high oil temperature'' lights were blinking.
Graham said the smoke that some on the plane had reported was
actually oil fumes.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Airlines mechanics examined the plane and decided to send
it back to Montreal for further inspection.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers were to continue on to Glasgow on two other planes
provided by Royal Airlines.

GREENSPAN WORRIES THAT GLOBAL CRISES COULD THREATEN U.S. ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (EDS: Adds analysis on possibility of interest rate cut; info on
just-released Aug. employment report; ID for Deputy Treasury
Secretary Lawrence Summers; polishing throughout.)  
(js) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER with RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman,
signaled Friday that the central bank is now less concerned about
inflation as a threat to the U.S. economy but is increasingly wary
that the spreading global financial crisis could harm the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's comments seemed to open the door to consideration of
an interest rate cut if the global financial situation continued to
deteriorate or if the U.S. economy showed signs of stalling.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's comments at the University of California at Berkeley
came just minutes before Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin met here
with Japan's new finance minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, to hammer home
the message that the best hope of halting the international crisis
lies in quick action by Tokyo to stimulate its economy and shore up
its financial system.
</P>
<P>
   But with market volatility having spread to Latin America and
with Russia veering toward economic collapse, U.S. officials said
they feared that it would be increasingly difficult to contain the
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a week in which Wall Street experienced a sharp
sell off, Greenspan said that even the United States was
increasingly vulnerable. ``It is just not credible that the United
States can remain an oasis of prosperity unaffected by a world that
is experiencing greatly increased stress,'' he said. The current
state of the economy was reflected in Friday's August employment
report, which showed that payrolls grew by 365,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan stopped well short of suggesting that the Federal
Reserve will cut interest rates, a step being urged on him by a
growing chorus of economists and officials in other countries. An
interest-rate reduction in the United States would help reduce
borrowing costs around the world and could be a powerful
psychological boost to embattled investors at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenspan's comments were a marked departure from his last
major policy statement, in July, when he told Congress that the
risks of inflation outweighed the possibility that the global
financial turmoil could push the otherwise strong U.S. economy into
recession.
</P>
<P>
   The global turmoil that has robbed countries of prosperity and
growth has benefited the United States so far by helping to dampen
inflation and slow down an economy that was at risk of overheating,
Greenspan said in his speech Friday night. The downward pressure on
inflation is likely to intensify as the turmoil in other nations
mounts, a development that he said led Federal Reserve
policy-makers to rethink their strategy at their last meeting on
Aug. 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the spring and early summer, the Federal Open Market
Committee was concerned that a rise in inflation was the primary
threat to the continued expansion of the economy,'' he said. ``By
the time of the committee's August meeting, the risks had become
balanced, and the committee will need to consider carefully the
potential ramifications of ongoing developments since that
meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's wording indicated that the committee had abandoned
its formal policy of leaning toward an interest rate increase in
favor of a neutral stance that favors neither a rate increase nor a
cut. The Fed's next policy meeting is Sept. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan went on to suggest that the Fed would not rush into a
decision about reducing rates just because of this week's slide in
stocks.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We have relearned in recent weeks that just as a bull stock
market feels unending and secure as an economy and stock market
move forward, so it can feel when markets contract that recovery is
inconceivable,'' he said. ``Both, of course, are wrong. But because
of the difficulty imagining a turnabout when such emotions take
hold, periods of euphoria or distress tend to feed on themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, who has been warning investors for nearly two years
that stock prices were higher than reasonable expectations of
earnings growth would justify, did not say whether he thought
stocks were now more fairly valued after this week's tumble on Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the 13 percent annual growth in earnings projected
by analysts ``is unlikely to materialize.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan joined with Rubin after his speech in meeting with
Miyazawa.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week in Moscow, President Clinton termed the
meeting with Miyazawa, who served as Japan's prime minister for two
years until a surprise fracturing of the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party in 1993, as ``profoundly important.'' That statement
reflected a growing view in the administration that the best hope
of choking off the 14-month old Asian crisis is to bring about a
long-overdue turnaround in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   But Treasury officials winced at Clinton's characterization
because they fear that Japan is still weeks or months away from
decisive action, at a time that markets are fraying around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   All the early indications from Tokyo were that Miyazawa was
arriving in San Francisco with few new ideas, no new plans and only
vague promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``This meeting was never designed or intended to address the
question of a plan,'' Rubin said Friday on a flight to San
Francisco. ``We'll be extremely interested in Miyazawa's discussion
of the banking system and fiscal policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The main reason Rubin and his aides were seeking to play down
expectations was their fear that the world's jittery markets could
react badly to news of little progress from the meeting. But it is
also in part because Rubin and Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers have relatively little leverage: Their explicit criticisms
of Japan in recent months have created a backlash in Tokyo, and the
Japanese Parliament is spinning its wheels as the ruling and
opposition parties argue with each other over what to do about the
insolvency of some of the world's largest banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we will propose anything new,'' a senior
Japanese official said before the meeting. ``It is just that for
the first time we have a finance minister who can explain what our
government is doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The official was referring to Miyazawa's greatest attribute as
an international diplomat: He speaks fluent English, learned during
extensive travels in the United States before World War II, and for
half a century he has been cast into crisis situations and
negotiations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But in this case, he has relatively little to work with. Japan's
Parliament has been talking for months about passing legislation
that would address the country's deepening banking crisis. But the
debate has just begun, and it has been bogged down by the question
of whether billions of dollars in public funds should be used to
bail out banks that were so wildly mismanaged that they now have
upwards of a trillion dollars in bad loans on their books.
</P>
<P>
   The test case is how the government deals with the Long-Term
Credit Bank of Japan, or LTCB, one of the country's largest
financial institutions. There is movement in Tokyo toward steps
that would essentially nationalize the bank, using taxpayer dollars
to rebuild its capital. U.S. officials clearly fear, however, that
Japan is not ready to accept the pain of closing the weakest
institutions _ and will further delay resolving the bad debts that
are freezing the Japanese economy.

YANKEES WIN NO. 100, 11-6 OVER CHICAGO 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The Yankees have won 100 games many times in their
extraordinary history, but Babe Ruth never played on a team that
won 100 like the '98 Yankees have. Nor did Joe DiMaggio, or Mickey
Mantle, or Reggie Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees came back from a two-run deficit Friday night to
earn their 100th victory of the season, 11-6, over the Chicago
White Sox. Their record improved to 100 wins and 38 losses _ the
fewest number of defeats for any team winning 100 since the 1909
Pittsburgh Pirates (36). Only four teams in the 20th century had
fewer losses when they reached 100 victories, according to the
Elias Sports Bureau. It is also the fastest calendar date for a
team to reach 100 victories _ the previous was Sept. 9 by the 1906
Cubs and the 1954 Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Every victory, it seems, pushes the '98 Yankees to another
milestone. Ten more victories and they will tie the Yankees'
single-season record, set by the 1927 Yankees (110). The Yankees'
magic number for clinching the American League East has been
reduced to five.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams slugged two home runs Friday night, including
the eighth-inning shot that propelled the Yankees into the lead.
Both Jeff Nelson and Mike Stanton, important pieces to the Yankees'
bullpen, pitched effectively. Nelson pitched two-thirds of an
inning, retiring Frank Thomas and Albert Belle.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago led, 4-3, in the top of the eighth inning. Chuck
Knoblauch opened the inning by chopping the ball off home plate and
toward first base; Greg Norton rushed in and gloved the grounder,
but not quickly enough to tag Knoblauch as he sped past. Knoblauch
quickly stole second, moving into scoring position. Then Derek
Jeter had enough strength to fight off an inside fastball and
dribble a roller through the middle, sending Knoblauch home with
the tying run.
</P>
<P>
   After Paul O'Neill flied out, Bill Simas relieved Chad Bradford,
and as many pitchers did early in the year, he tried blowing a
chest-high fastball past Williams. Early in the year, this worked.
On the fourth day of September, the chest-high fastball was
redirected into the right-center-field stands, Williams looking up
and watching the ball, his helmet falling off as he neared first
base.
</P>
<P>
   He rounded the bases, greeted at home plate by Tino Martinez _
and before Williams could settle into the dugout, Martinez blasted
a home run, as well, his 25th, in almost the same spot as Williams
had before him.
</P>
<P>
   Graeme Lloyd, one of five relievers following Orlando Hernandez,
earned the victory.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hernandez's pitching mechanics are elaborate, with all the
spinning gears and movement of a Swiss watch. With so many pieces
and parts to his motion, it's remarkable Hernandez can maintain
command of his pitches.
</P>
<P>
   And Friday night, he could not. Hernandez struggled in trying to
find the proper point of release for his slider, and as a result,
he sometimes threw it far too low and outside, or he flipped it
over the plate. Thomas powered a fastball for a double with two
outs in the first inning, after falling behind in the count by one
ball and two strikes, and after Hernandez failed to finish off
Thomas with his slider. Hernandez jumped ahead on the count to
Belle, 1-2, but when Belle fought back to 3-2, Hernandez hung a
slider and Belle walloped it _ an estimated 400 feet, left-center
field, his 43rd home run of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez walked three batters in the second inning, and if not
for a quick throw from catcher Jorge Posada to cut down a potential
base-stealer, the White Sox might have added to their 2-0 lead.
Through two innings, Hernandez had thrown 47 pitches, an
exceptionally high number.
</P>
<P>
   After the Yankees came back to tie the game at 3-3 in the top of
the fourth, Hernandez continued to have problems with his control.
He walked Thomas in the fifth inning, again after getting ahead in
the count, 1-2. Belle popped up, but Robin Ventura walked, and
after Norton walked on five pitches, loading the bases, Hernandez
snapped at the return thrown from Posada, furious with himself,
then turned and walked off the back of the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Stottlemyre, the Yankees' pitching coach, hustled to
conference with Hernandez, Posada translating on the mound, but
Hernandez knew what the problem was all along: The six walks El
Duque allowed were the most in any of his 17 starts this season.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Abbott's fly ball enabled Thomas to tag up and score from
third base and push the White Sox ahead, 4-3. Hernandez departed
after six innings, having allowed six hits and three strikeouts and
the four runs.

FERRARO, ON CAMPAIGN TRAIL, SHARPENS CRITICISM OF CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Conn.)  (js) 
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMIRA, N.Y. _ On the first day of a three-day campaign swing in
upstate New York, Geraldine Ferraro on Friday delivered her
sharpest criticism yet of President Clinton's involvement with
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with editors and reporters at The Star-Gazette in
Elmira, a Gannett newspaper, Ms. Ferraro, who is in a three-way
contest for the Democratic Senate nomination, said she agreed with
the substance, though not the timing, of Sen. Joseph Lieberman's
speech on the Senate floor on Thursday, in which he called the
president's relationship with the White House intern ``immoral.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with what he said,'' Ms. Ferraro, the former
vice-presidential candidate said of Lieberman, adding later, ``I
don't think there are too many Democrats who don't agree with
him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think it's terrible, you know, what happened,'' she
said of Clinton's actions. ``I actually believed that he didn't do
anything. I had no reason not to believe him, and I was as
distressed as any, and perhaps more so, because I do know him, and
I didn't expect that he'd lie to the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Ferraro was also critical of the decision by Lieberman,
D-Conn., to deliver the speech while the president was in Northern
Ireland trying to bolster a fragile peace process. ``The timing, I
think, is wrong,'' she said. ``He should have waited until he came
home. I think when the president is off doing business outside of
this country, that he should be able to do the business of the
country and not be distracted by questions and speeches like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether she had given any thought to what psition she
would take on impeachment if the issue came before her as a
senator, Ms. Ferraro said, ``Sure.'' She said she would wait for
Kenneth Starr's report on his investigation of Clinton to see
whether Clinton's offenses went beyond ``a man lying about his sex
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ferraro's stance Friday afternoon was sharper than her
position immediately after the president's speech three weeks ago,
when she described herself as ``disappointed'' by the relationship
and the fact that he had misled the American people.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Ferraro's opponents for the Democratic nomination
essentially reiterated what they had said in the days after
Clinton's speech. ``I said I thought the president was wrong,''
said Rep. Charles Schumer of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer noted that he was a member of the House Judiciary
Committee, which would consider any impeachment proceedings that
might be brought against Clinton. ``In terms of specific action, I
don't think it's fair for me to say anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A third candidate, Mark Green, the New York City public
advocate, said his position had not changed since Lieberman's
speech. ``What the president did was clearly immoral, deceptive and
inexcusable,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he thought talk of impeachment was ridiculous.
``Let's get a grip here,'' Green said. ``Richard Nixon's obvious
public corruption of the justice system and the FBI, which led to
29 executive branch officials going to jail, is of a wholly
different magnitude than Bill Clinton's fundamentally private
misconduct.''

LEWIS SELECTED HICKS' SUCCESSOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Antelope Valley native Jermaine Lewis is the
Bruins' top tailback, for now. Lewis will start Sept. 12 against
Texas, but Keith Brown and rapidly improving freshman DeShaun
Foster will get their chances, as well.
</P>
<P>
   It's UCLA's most riveting competition, with the potential to
change weekly until one player establishes himself as the heir to
Karim Abdul-Jabbar and Skip Hicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jermaine was a little more consistent,'' coach Bob Toledo
said. ``But Keith will play early.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster's appearances, and carries, will be predetermined.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other personnel developments Friday:
</P>
<P>
   __Michael Wiley will start at outside linebacker, with Santi
Hall playing second string.
</P>
<P>
   __At the troublesome free-safety spot, where Eric Whitfield and
Jason Stephens are competing, the coaches decided not to decide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might go all the way to game time'' before making a
decision, Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   __Josh Webb couldn't crack the defensive-line rotation, so the
Bruins decided to put his size (6-6, 280 pounds) and athleticism to
use: he has moved to offensive tackle. The switch bolsters UCLA's
line depth, freeing tackle James Ghezzi to play guard or center if
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Rookies in red: Three true freshmen definitely will play:
Foster, linebacker Robert Thomas and nose guard Ken Kocher.
</P>
<P>
   Two others, receiver Jon Dubravac and cornerback Julius
Williams, might play. Dubravac is one of the biggest surprises,
having improved dramatically since camp began. He's pushing Hart
High alumnus Cody Joyce for the fifth receiver spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``(On July 1), I thought we'd redshirt Dubravac,'' Toledo said.
``We may still, but I doubt it.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA needs four cornerbacks, and Williams is currently running
fifth, behind starters Marques Anderson and Jason Bell, and
reserves Damian Allen and Ryan Roques. Whitfield, one of UCLA's
best athletes, can play cornerback if needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real possibility we'll still redshirt Williams,''
Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   It now appears both freshmen offensive linemen, tackle Blake
Worley and guard Mike Saffer, will redshirt. Injuries have slowed
their progress, and Webb's move could solve the depth problem.
</P>
<P>
   Ghezzi, Troy Danoff, Matt Phelan, Ed Anderson and David Wilford
are the reserve linemen.
</P>
<P>
   Walking wounded: Bumps and bruises aside, the Bruins survived
training camp in good health.
</P>
<P>
   Only two members of the two-deep are in danger of missing the
Texas game: starting fullback Craig Walendy (allergic reaction to
bug bites) has not practiced and is not expected to play.
Second-string nose guard Kocher (sprained ankle) did some light
running Friday for the first time in nine days. But if he plays, it
will be in a limited capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Pleasant surprise: Toledo canceled today's scrimmage and gave
the players the weekend off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little reward,'' he said. ``We're relatively healthy,
and I wanted to give them a little rest. I want them to get away
from football, get out of here and relax.''

$1 MILLION BID FOR NO. 62 BALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An anonymous donor has offered to pay $1 million to the fan who
catches the 62nd home run ball by Mark McGwire or Sammy Sosa to
help in the continuing search for justice in the 1980 murders of
three American nuns and a lay worker in El Salvador.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to raise awareness,'' the donor, a longtime baseball
fan, said Friday in a telephone interview, ``and what better way to
publicize the cause than to tie it to the home run derby? I hope
when sportscasters talk about the money, they'll also talk about
the case.''
</P>
<P>
   The donor, who says he wants to protect his identity because he
fears for his safety, will buy a $650,000 annuity that will pay the
fan $50,000 annually for 20 years. His plans are to resell the
ball, and any profits above $650,000 will go to the Lawyers
Committee for Human Rights, a New York-based organization that
represents the victims' families and promotes human rights around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no profit, the donor has guaranteed to make a
$75,000 donation. He said he would make the same donation even if
the fan declined to sell the ball and gave it to McGwire or Sosa or
donated it to the Baseball Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   The donor said he had followed the case and was particularly
outraged that two Salvadoran officers implicated by a U.N. Truth
Commission report for covering up the murders were never
prosecuted, and live in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, four Salvadoran National Guard members and their
immediate superior were convicted of the murders and sentenced to
30 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, three of the five were released. The Truth Commission
found that Gen. Jose Guillermo Garcia and Col. Carlos Eugenio Vides
Casanova, the two officers now living in Florida, organized and
directed the cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, the four former national guardsmen said they acted
only after receiving ``orders from above.'' They made their
admissions during interviews with R. Scott Greathead and Robert
Weiner, members of the Lawyers Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``These officers _ you can't prove they ordered the murders, but
they covered it up, and now they're living comfortably,'' the donor
said. ``Everybody I talk to is outraged by all this.''
</P>
<P>
   The donor approached the Lawyers Committee on Thursday, and the
committee spent Friday investigating him and his ability to pay for
the annuity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's what he says he is,'' Greathead said. The donor's lawyer
is Elaine Wood of Kroll Associates, a private investigation and
security firm. She said the donor's background and finances checked
out ``affirmatively.''

McGWIRE INSPIRES FANS AS HE CHASES BASEBALL HISTORY 
 
By NEIL HOHLFELD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Over the past 60 years, the St. Louis Cardinals have
been known mainly for their speed and aggressiveness on the bases.
Dating from Pepper Martin in the 1930s to Lou Brock in the 1960s to
Vince Coleman in the 1980s, the Cardinals have achieved success, by
and large, by playing small ball.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Cardinals haven't been successful, but they've
changed their mode of attack in a big way. With Mark McGwire
hitting home runs at what has been a record pace, the Cardinals
have left their personal dead-ball era and started living large.
</P>
<P>
   After McGwire hit four home runs in his last two games at
Florida this week to raise his season total to 59, expectations ran
high Friday night at Busch Stadium. But in a 3-2 loss to
Cincinnati, McGwire was 0-for-3 with two strikeouts and a walk.
</P>
<P>
   He remains three home runs away from breaking the single-season
record of 61 set by Roger Maris in 1961. Sammy Sosa of the Chicago
Cubs hit No. 57 on Friday night, reinforcing that this year's
home-run chase will be a two-man contest.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire once again was stymied by a Reds pitching staff that has
hardly baffled the rest of the National League. In seven games
against Cincinnati this season, McGwire has no home runs _ the only
team against which he has not connected in 1998. The Reds have
allowed 151 home runs this year, the 10th-highest total in the
16-team National League.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Reds this season, McGwire is 2-for-16 with no RBIs
and 12 walks _ five of them intentional. Friday night, former
Houston Astros pitcher Pete Harnisch got McGwire to fly to right
field in the first inning and struck him out on a high fastball in
the third. In the fifth, McGwire walked on a 3-2 pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said all along that if you make your pitches, you
probably won't give up a home run,'' Harnisch said. ``That's not to
say if I miss my spot by eight inches, he won't hit it 500 feet.
Tonight, though, I hit my spots and made my pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Against Reds reliever Scott Sullivan in the seventh inning,
McGwire struck out on three pitches. With flashbulbs popping on
every pitch to McGwire and fans literally praying in the seats for
home run No. 60, the scene at Busch Stadium was one of tension and
anxiety each time the redheaded slugger came to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's quest for the record has turned on this
baseball-crazed city in a way that hasn't been seen since 1987,
when the team made its most recent World Series appearance. A
sell-out season-high crowd of 48,076 watched Friday's contest, and
the next four games through Tuesday are sold out. The Cardinals
expect to draw 3.2 million fans this season, which will set a
franchise record.
</P>
<P>
   This year's all-out enthusiasm in St. Louis is a testament to
the power of power. Without McGwire's quest to overtake Maris, the
crowd likely would have been half of what it was Friday. The Reds
and Cardinals were a combined 43 1/2 games behind the Astros in the
NL Central Division.
</P>
<P>
   But with McGwire bearing down on the record, seemingly nothing
else matters in this city. At a hotel near the St. Louis airport, a
desk clerk said Friday a man told him he would pay up to $500 for a
seat in the left-field loge level, where the majority of McGwire's
home runs at Busch Stadium have landed this year.
</P>
<P>
   Security in that area of seats was tight. A ticket for a
front-row seat was no match for one in the left-field bleachers. In
order to enter that area, a ticket had to be produced.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening here this year goes beyond amazing,'' said
St. Louis manager Tony La Russa. ``He's absolutely turned on this
city with what he's done. And what's so remarkable is that from the
very first day of spring training, people have asked him, `Can you
break the record?'
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't sneaked up on anyone. He's just gone out and done
it. When I see the concentration and the focus he's had during all
this, it's beyond description.''
</P>
<P>
   The McGwire story is hardly a St. Louis-only affair. Major
League Baseball issued nearly 700 media credentials for Friday's
game, and that number likely will grow as McGwire gets closer to
62. A typical World Series will attract between 900 and 1,000 media
members.
</P>
<P>
   Busch Stadium security personnel are being assisted by the St.
Louis Police Department, and, according to Major League Baseball
security director Kevin Hallinan, FBI personnel.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, McGwire did not appear in an interview room and
had not come to his locker in the Cardinals' clubhouse 30 minutes
after the game. That goes against the trend McGwire has followed in
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In the past month or so, McGwire has seemed more relaxed,
despite the growing media attention. In early August, McGwire
chastised a group of reporters who questioned him about a game by
saying, ``Worry about your families, don't worry about me.''
</P>
<P>
   After three more home runs by McGwire, the fun will go into
overdrive. If McGwire breaks Maris' record before Sosa and the home
run happens in St. Louis, a postgame celebration is planned by the
Cardinals. The loyal St. Louis fans, who for years could only dream
of a long-ball attack, will revel in having the record-setter on
their team.

GONZALEZ SURPASSES OWN CLUB RBI MARK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ In his remarkable season of home-run smashes
and extra-base hits, Juan Gonzalez took the easy route to a club
record for runs batted in last night.
</P>
<P>
   He picked up No. 145 in the third inning of Texas' 9-3 victory
against Minnesota when, of all things, he was nicked, almost
imperceptibly, on the left forearm by a bases-loaded pitch from
struggling Twins starter Frank Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a little bit,'' he said with a sheepish grin, pretending
to look for a bruise that wasn't there.
</P>
<P>
   ``But an RBI is an RBI.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez added No. 146 in his standard fashion, pulling an
eighth-inning double just inside the left-field line.
</P>
<P>
   He also held the previous club record of 144, set in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't that long ago that 100 RBI in a season was a
milestone,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said. ``All those things
have gone by the wayside now. He continues to amaze me with the
number of runs he can drive in.''
</P>
<P>
   Barring injury, Gonzalez is almost certain to become the first
American League player to drive in 150 runs since 1949. That year,
Boston's Vern Stephens and Ted Williams each had 159, and at his
current rate of production, Gonzalez should top that one, too. He
could even become the first major-league player in 60 years to top
160 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   And Gonzalez, who also is on a 15-game hitting streak, perhaps
is the leading candidate for the league's MVP award, which he won
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's Nomar Garciaparra is among the other MVP possibilities,
as are Anaheim's Darin Erstad, and New York's tandem of Derek Jeter
and Bernie Williams, although they could split the Yankees vote.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez believes the Rangers might have to win the American
League West _ they did in '96 _ for him to bring home another MVP
trophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win the division would give me more chances,'' he said.
``We've got three weeks remaining, and I'll just continue to work
hard on my numbers every night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing is, winning every ballgame right now is very
important to us. And we need a lot of runs every night.''

ERSTAD OUT AT LEAST TWO WEEKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM BARRERO  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ First baseman Darin Erstad's availability for the
remainder of the regular season remained in limbo Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After suffering a second-degree strain of his left hamstring
running out a single in Cleveland on Wednesday, Erstad underwent an
MRI and was examined on Thursday by Dr. Lewis Yocum.
</P>
<P>
   No decision was made on Erstad's status, except that he will
continue to rehabilitate the leg.
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Terry Collins said another evaluation would be
done in 7-10 days and that Erstad would not go on the disabled list
since there is plenty of room on the expanded roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be that long before they can make another diagnosis on
this,'' Collins said of the waiting period. ``Are we going to be
counting on him over the next two weeks? No.''
</P>
<P>
   Erstad came off the disabled list from the same injury on Aug.
19 after having played every game this season, but Collins said
this time it seems worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is worse than Darin's previous injury,'' Collins said.
``It was the same type of injury, but more intense. He's hurt
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels officials said Erstad spent the day in treatment and was
not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hurting without him,'' said Gregg Jefferies, who could
see some action at first in Erstad's absence. ``Hopefully he's OK.
We'll just have to pick up the slack.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien starts: It took more than a month, but catcher Charlie
O'Brien finally made his first start for the Angels since being
acquired July 31 in a trade with the Chicago White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien made his debut with the team in the final game of the
recent road trip, coming on in the eighth inning at Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to see him and get him in there,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien, who threw out Dean Palmer trying to steal in the second
inning and Larry Sutton in the third, was activated from the 15-day
disabled list Sept. 1 after recovering from a fractured right thumb
while he was with the Chicago White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Four-man rotation: Because the Angels had an off day Thursday
and two more next week, Collins said the team will go with a
four-man pitching rotation until further notice.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, Chuck Finley, Jack McDowell and Steve Sparks will fill the
spots.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of options: Although the Angels have suffered more injuries
than a division-leading team would like, one thing Collins can't
complain about is depth.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the most recent injury to Erstad, the team still can
turn to Chris Pritchett, Jefferies or even Craig Shipley, who was
activated from the disabled list Friday, to replace him at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like I got about 50 players,'' Collins said. ``I've
got all the depth I need.''
</P>
<P>
   In the bullpen, left-hander Allen Watson, who was a starter,
adds another solid arm to take away some of the pressure from any
tired bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Watson recorded his first victory in relief this season against
the Yankees on Aug. 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect him to like (the new role), but he's accepted
it and knows he's part of the puzzle,'' Collins said. ``He'll do
what we ask him to do in order to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's the way it has to be with anybody on this team at
this time of year.''

DESERT CITY TOPS IN HOMES FOR COPS UNDER FEDERAL PROGRAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PATRICK McGREEVY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Beating metropolises like Los Angeles and
Chicago, Lancaster, in the Antelope Valley north of L.A., leads the
nation in the number of police officers buying repossessed homes at
half-price under a federal program.
</P>
<P>
   Neighboring Palmdale ranks third.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo
disclosed the cities' rankings Friday in announcing that the
program is being expanded.
</P>
<P>
   Cementing the Antelope Valley's reputation as an enclave for
peace officers, Cuomo said 115 have taken advantage of the Officer
Next Door program to buy homes in distressed areas of Lancaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is far and away the largest number for any city,'' said
Stan Vosper, a HUD spokesman. ``The next largest is Chicago, with
97.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmdale had the third-largest number in the nation with 91
officers, while 82 officers bought homes in Los Angeles, putting it
in fourth place.
</P>
<P>
   The Officer Next Door program enables peace officers to buy
homes at half the appraised value, provided that they agree to live
there for at least three years. The program is designed to boost
homeownership while improving neighborhood values and quality of
life.
</P>
<P>
   In Lancaster, Los Angeles Police Department officers account for
more than 20 percent of participants, although more precise figures
were not immediately available. Buyers also included members of
other area police departments, sheriff's deputies and correctional
officers at California State Prison-Los Angeles County in
Lancaster.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, more than 10 percent of all homes purchased nationally
in the Officer Next Door program were in the Antelope Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Antelope Valley officials said it is no surprise that their
suburban cities led the program, given their traditional popularity
with law enforcement officers from Los Angeles and other areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of officers who lived here before this program,
because they like the privacy they get here,'' said Elizabeth
Brubaker, redevelopment project coordinator in Lancaster.
</P>
<P>
   However, Lancaster and Palmdale may have proved too popular for
their own good. So many officers have bought there that HUD took
the unusual step of cutting off the program in those cities in
June, with more than 300 other officers still hoping to buy there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very disappointed,'' Brubaker said. ``We're not really
happy about that at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Brubaker said she thought federal officials might have ordered
the halt in Lancaster because they realized its neighborhoods are
not as old and distressed as communities in other parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's because our houses are very nice and our area is
nice,'' she said. ``They don't consider us as a ghetto.''
</P>
<P>
   However, some are wondering if the Antelope Valley might once
again be able to participate in the program after the announcement
Friday by Cuomo and Vice President Al Gore that 2,000 homes were
sold to officers nationwide during the first year of the program
and that HUD plans to make available an additional 1,000 homes to
keep the popular project going.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police officer moving onto the block is the single best
thing we can do,'' Cuomo told reporters in a telephone conference.
``A single officer next door can start a cycle of reclamation and
rebirth'' for a distressed neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   However, Vosper said Friday he could not determine whether the
extension of the program might reopen opportunities in the Antelope
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the HUD program, the city of Los Angeles has a
separate one that provides discounted mortgages and subsidizes
closing costs for LAPD officers who buy homes in the city. The goal
is to encourage officers to live in the communities where they
work.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles officials said last month that 145 police officers
and firefighters have bought homes in the city with the help of
both home-buying programs, with some 500 other Los Angeles public
safety employees having expressed interest in participating.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, a study by the American Civil Liberties Union of
Southern California concluded that 83 percent of LAPD officers
lived outside the city, many in predominantly white suburban
enclaves far from the ethnically diverse community they police.
That was a concern to the ACLU, which feared officers would not be
able to relate those they serve.
</P>
<P>
   The study found, for instance, that 120 LAPD officers lived in
Palmdale.
</P>
<P>
   Although the HUD program does not require officers to buy in the
areas where they work, Cuomo said that is one of several goals of
the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a police officer live in the community they serve is an
advantage in and of itself,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that the HUD program may be helping LAPD officers move
out of the city -- apparently in conflict with the city's own
subsidy program -- did not cause great concern to Los Angeles
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our perspective, what we would like to see is officers
living in the city limits,'' said Police Commissioner Dean Hansell.
``I would hope that with this extension we would see a lot more
officers buy homes in Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   LAPD Cmdr. Dave Kalish, a department spokesman, also had a mixed
response.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy that our personnel are receiving help in buying
homes anywhere,'' Kalish said. ``It would be even better if the
homes were in the city limits.''
</P>
<P>
   ACLU spokeswoman Ann Bradley said her organization remains
concerned that few LAPD officers live in Los Angeles, but she
praised the HUD program for helping officers move into distressed
communities.
</P>
<P>
   HUD officials also said their program still has other strong
merits, which include helping distressed communities to benefit
from the presence of law enforcement officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's (to benefit) the highest-crime neighborhoods, the
highest-poverty neighborhoods. That's why we have a 50 percent
discount,'' Cuomo said.

ERSTAD OUT AT LEAST TWO WEEKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
CORRECTS BYLINE 
By JIM BARRERO  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ First baseman Darin Erstad's availability for the
remainder of the regular season remained in limbo Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After suffering a second-degree strain of his left hamstring
running out a single in Cleveland on Wednesday, Erstad underwent an
MRI and was examined on Thursday by Dr. Lewis Yocum.
</P>
<P>
   No decision was made on Erstad's status, except that he will
continue to rehabilitate the leg.
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Terry Collins said another evaluation would be
done in 7-10 days and that Erstad would not go on the disabled list
since there is plenty of room on the expanded roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be that long before they can make another diagnosis on
this,'' Collins said of the waiting period. ``Are we going to be
counting on him over the next two weeks? No.''
</P>
<P>
   Erstad came off the disabled list from the same injury on Aug.
19 after having played every game this season, but Collins said
this time it seems worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is worse than Darin's previous injury,'' Collins said.
``It was the same type of injury, but more intense. He's hurt
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels officials said Erstad spent the day in treatment and was
not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hurting without him,'' said Gregg Jefferies, who could
see some action at first in Erstad's absence. ``Hopefully he's OK.
We'll just have to pick up the slack.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien starts: It took more than a month, but catcher Charlie
O'Brien finally made his first start for the Angels since being
acquired July 31 in a trade with the Chicago White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien made his debut with the team in the final game of the
recent road trip, coming on in the eighth inning at Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to see him and get him in there,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien, who threw out Dean Palmer trying to steal in the second
inning and Larry Sutton in the third, was activated from the 15-day
disabled list Sept. 1 after recovering from a fractured right thumb
while he was with the Chicago White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Four-man rotation: Because the Angels had an off day Thursday
and two more next week, Collins said the team will go with a
four-man pitching rotation until further notice.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, Chuck Finley, Jack McDowell and Steve Sparks will fill the
spots.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of options: Although the Angels have suffered more injuries
than a division-leading team would like, one thing Collins can't
complain about is depth.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the most recent injury to Erstad, the team still can
turn to Chris Pritchett, Jefferies or even Craig Shipley, who was
activated from the disabled list Friday, to replace him at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like I got about 50 players,'' Collins said. ``I've
got all the depth I need.''
</P>
<P>
   In the bullpen, left-hander Allen Watson, who was a starter,
adds another solid arm to take away some of the pressure from any
tired bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Watson recorded his first victory in relief this season against
the Yankees on Aug. 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect him to like (the new role), but he's accepted
it and knows he's part of the puzzle,'' Collins said. ``He'll do
what we ask him to do in order to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's the way it has to be with anybody on this team at
this time of year.''

REDS STUMP MCGWIRE; IT'S STILL 59 AND COUNTING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ When the Cincinnati Reds saw Mark McGwire in July,
they walked him, then walked him again, walked him some more and
kept on walking him. With McGwire going into a three-game series
with the Reds only two home runs away from Roger Maris' home run
record, Jack McKeon, the Reds' manager, was asked if he planned to
have his pitchers repeat their July performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game situation will dictate it,'' McKeon said Friday night
before the Reds played the St. Louis Cardinals. ``I can't tell you
anything now.''
</P>
<P>
   McKeon's pitchers, Pete Harnisch and Scott Sullivan, spoke
volumes. They pitched to McGwire and held him hitless in three
at-bats. They each struck him out once, and the only time he
reached base was when Harnisch walked him on a 3-2 pitch.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, who entered the game with 12 home runs in the
Cardinals' previous 17 games and his previous 52 at-bats, not only
didn't become the third player in major-league history to hit 60
home runs, but he also lost a bit of his lead over Sammy Sosa
because Sosa hit his 57th home run in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   The home run was Sosa's first in six games against the Pirates
this season, but the Reds continued to confound McGwire. They are
the only National League team he has not hit a home run against
this season, and they extended his failure to seven games and 16
at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire opted not to be available to the more than 600 reporters
who were at Busch Stadium, but his manager, Tony LaRussa, credited
Harnisch and Sullivan with doing a good job of pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Asked after the Reds' 3-2 victory if he thought McKeon had the
Reds going at McGwire more than they had in July when they walked
him 11 times, LaRussa said, ``Yeah, I wish he hadn't done it so
much. I wish they had walked him three times. Harnisch made very
good pitches. Then Sullivan made three Hall of Fame pitches. They
were really nasty pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Each time McGwire walked to the plate, the sellout crowd of
48,076 cheered loudly and stood at their seats. Cameras flashed
from all points of the stadium with each pitch, fans hoping to get
lucky and get some minuscule image of the swing that produced No.
60.
</P>
<P>
   In the first inning, McGwire came to bat after Brian Jordan
lined a one-out single to left field and continued to second when
the ball scooted past Dmitri Young for an error. He lofted a fly
ball that the fans thought was headed for the right field fence,
but it turned out to be a routine fly ball that Reggie Sanders
caught easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that ball wasn't a home run,'' Harnisch said. ``But
when he hit it, it went so high the crowd went berserk. But I knew
he hit it straight up in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   In the third and fifth innings, McGwire didn't hit the ball at
all. He struck out swinging in the third and walked on a 3-2 pitch
in the fifth. The walk loaded the bases and preceded a sacrifice
fly by Ray Lankford for the Cardinals' second run in the inning and
the game.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire got his last chance, for this night, to match Babe
Ruth's 60 home runs in 1927 in the seventh inning. But Scott
Sullivan didn't give him much of a chance. Sullivan, who relieved
Harnisch at the start of that inning, threw three pitches, and
McGwire swung at all three and missed all three.
</P>
<P>
   ``McGwire is at kind of a disadvantage in the sense that the
spotlight's on him,'' said Sullivan, a 27-year-old right-hander.
``The average player might elevate his game to a higher level to
get him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said he threw a fastball on the first pitch just to try
to get ahead of McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   ``That probably was the best pitch to hit,'' Sullivan said. ``I
don't know if he was going to do much with the sliders. They were
down and away. I was lucky enough to have a little bite on the
sliders and he chased them.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Each time McGwire came to bat the pitchers were given new balls
to use.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know anything about it,'' Harnisch said. ``I asked
the second base umpire if these are the hard balls because they
kept switching them around.''
</P>
<P>
   The balls are the same as the others used in games, but they
specially marked with serial numbers so when McGwire does hit a
home run, officials will be able to determine which ball is
legitimate when a fan claims he caught it.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Tomko, the Reds' scheduled starting pitcher for Sunday's
third game of the series, acknowledged that he and his teammates
have discussed the scenario in which McGwire would break the record
against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have chatted about it,'' Tomko said. ``What
would they do if he hits the home run? If you're playing third,
would you high-five him? It's a monumental thing. It doesn't happen
very often that someone is going to achieve this feat so everyone
is sort of preparing how they're going to feel and how they're
going to react when this happens.''
</P>
<P>
   When he realized that he would be pitching Sunday's game, Tomko
related, he started thinking about the game and the possible
ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's three days away,'' he said. ``I sat back and said well,
if he gets a couple the first couple games he's going to be sitting
on 61. You play the little games, the scenarios, and try to think
how you would feel.''

HERSHISER MELLOWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Orel Hershiser says this is the greatest summer of
his baseball life.
</P>
<P>
   Like fastballs, priorities change with age. For Hershiser, it
seems it would be difficult to surpass 1988, when he threw 59
consecutive scoreless innings and pitched the Dodgers to a World
Series championship.
</P>
<P>
   But for the past month, Hershiser, now a member of the San
Francisco Giants, has been bringing his oldest son Quinton, 13, on
the road. Quinton has been a bat boy, a clubhouse kid and an
all-around buddy during his father's 16th big-league season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going to send him to camp, but in the end he didn't
want to go,'' Hershiser said. ``I said the only way out is to come
with me on the road. The Giants told me he had to work if he was
going to come. I can't tell you what it means to have him a long.
It's incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most endearing moments of the Giants season happened
last month, when reserve infielder Shawon Dunston was greeted by
his son, Shawon, Jr. after hitting a home run. New Giant Joe Carter
also has his son, Jordan, on this trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the kind of environment (Giants) manager Dusty (Baker)
has created around here,'' Hershiser said. ``I think it is one of
the reasons the team has done well this year. It has brought us
closer together.''
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser, 40, said he does not expect tonight's start against
the Dodgers to have the emotion of his July 15 appearance, his
first game in Dodger Stadium since leaving the club after the 1994
season. He pitched six innings and was the winner in a 5-3 Giants
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier now,'' said Hershiser, who ran back to the
clubhouse to compose himself before taking the mound in his first
start here. ``I don't think the novelty will ever wear off, but
it's not so difficult, now. That first game was something.''
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser was named National League Pitcher of the Month for
July, when he finished 4-0. But he is only 9-9 this season. He is
fourth among active pitchers with 188 victories and wants to reach
200.
</P>
<P>
   He also wants more trip to the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the pitcher I was, but that is one of the concessions
of age,'' he said. ``The goodness or the greatness doesn't show up
as much, but it is still there. We're in a playoff hunt, and I'll
be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick hits: After two long visits to the disabled list with
shoulder trouble this season, reliever Darren Hall will under
surgery next week to repair his right rotator cuff. Hall, who has a
history of shoulder and elbow problems, pitched just 111/3 innings
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tried to strengthen it with rehab, but the tear was just
too severe,'' said Dr. Frank Jobe, who will perform the surgery.

<P>
   FARGO, N.D. _ If this had to be the baseball season when the
home-run record was smashed, Sandy Thiel had a small request:
Please don't let it happen on her birthday, which is coming up in a
few days. That, she says, would force her ``to remember it for the
rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Sid Cichy had stopped watching baseball games altogether,
figuring it would be easier to take if he did not actually see it
happen.
</P>
<P>
   And Tim Olson had bet a candy bar and a soda that the
history-making home run would not happen and, in less delusional
moments, tried to tell himself that it was not a big deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't felt this way about baseball since I was in fifth
grade,'' said Olson, 45. ``I can hear the baseball cards rattling
through my bike spokes again, like when I was a kid and you put
them there with clothespins to make your bike sound like a
motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've pretty much resigned myself that they'll probably break
the record, and I keep reminding myself that it's not mine,'' Olson
added, referring to Mark McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals, who
hit his 58th and 59th home runs in Florida on Wednesday night, and
Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs, who hit No. 57 in Pittsburgh on
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Such were the emotional calisthenics that people were putting
themselves through in the hometown of Roger Maris, whose record of
61 home runs in a season had stood for 37 years but was fast
slipping away.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the country was gripped by irrepressible
excitement as McGwire and Sosa moved ever closer to the magic
number, people in Fargo were wrestling with more complicated
feelings. They were wistful and nostalgic, grateful for the sudden
flood of recognition being paid their hero, but achingly aware that
it was more of a requiem than a coronation.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just that Maris, who died in 1985 of lymphatic cancer,
was one of their own. It's also that people from this modest
prairie town, tundra-cold and table-flat, are moved by some of the
sadder particulars of the Maris story: that in 1961, when he played
right field for the New York Yankees, Maris felt hounded by
reporters and denigrated by those who did not want him to break the
record of 60 home runs set by another Yankee right fielder, Babe
Ruth, in 1927.
</P>
<P>
   People here are also keenly aware that Maris was never elected
to the Baseball Hall of Fame, and that the baseball commissioner
relegated his achievement to a footnote in the record books because
the regular season had been extended by eight games at that time _
a notation (since removed) that came to be known as the
``asterisk.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, people here believe that Fargo is considered to be
an asterisk, too. Although it is North Dakota's largest city, with
nearly 80,000 people, Fargo is rarely in the national spotlight.
People thought the movie ``Fargo'' made fun of them, and on top of
that, most of the film was shot in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of Fargo's record as well as Roger's,'' said Dick
Savageau, 64, a longtime friend.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Carney, 82, who knew Maris when he was a star all-round
high school athlete, said, ``We don't get many big heroes out of
North Dakota.''
</P>
<P>
   Out here, Roger Maris is as big as they come _ bigger still,
people say, because he never forgot his friends or lost his
down-to-earth demeanor.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There is a Roger Maris charity golf tournament and a Roger Maris
Cancer Center. And there is his baseball-diamond-shaped gravestone
in Holy Cross Cemetery, with its inscription, ``Against All Odds.''
</P>
<P>
   There is the Roger Maris museum, a 74-foot glass case in the
West Acres shopping mall, sandwiched between a Pet Center and a
Spencer Gifts store. It was placed there, said Jim McLaughlin, the
curator, because Maris wanted his plaques, bats and home-run balls
in a place where the admission was free and lots of people would
see them.
</P>
<P>
   Maris even designated 100 autographed postcards for visitors who
``understand who Roger Maris really is,'' said McLaughlin, who
bestowed one on a couple stopping by on their honeymoon and gave
another to a devoted elderly fan.
</P>
<P>
   A whole trove of Roger Maris folklore permeates Fargo. How
Maris, whose family was originally from Minnesota, played football
for Shanley High School and ran five kickoffs back for touchdowns
in one game, causing the opposing coach to say he dreaded when his
own team scored.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and classmates remember the young Maris as a prankster,
who once put pancake batter in the overshoes of the nuns at Shanley
High. And Bob Wood, a close friend, talks of the time they got
tired of hooligans pestering them and their dates when they parked
on Lover's Lane. Wood put on his sister's kerchief and he and Maris
pretended to be a couple.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they started harassing us, we'd jump out and have a nice
little fight with them,'' said Wood, now 63.
</P>
<P>
   Lover's Lane has since been renamed; now it's Roger Maris Drive.
</P>
<P>
   There is even ``Maris,'' the musical, created in part by Olson
and produced by Ms. Thiel, who are hoping it might get a nibble
from a New York theater someday. It's got a Mickey Mantle-Roger
Maris song-and-dance number, and a ballad about unflinching
loyalty:
</P>
<P>
   ``Long after the cheering fades
</P>
<P>
   And after the big parades,
</P>
<P>
   And long past all the accolades
</P>
<P>
   I'll still believe in you.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing better expresses Fargo's feelings for Maris, exalting in
his accomplishments, commiserating over the pressure he weathered
in that 1961 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really felt sorry for the guy,'' Savageau said. ``He'd get
that same question every day: Are you going to hit a home run
today? Are you going to break Babe Ruth's record? `How do I know?'
That would be his answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then it got personal,'' Savageau added. ``Do you womanize when
you're on the road? He was losing his hair, just getting so
uptight. He wanted out of the glass bowl that he was in, to go back
home and find his friends.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, some people have been worried that when someone
smacked number 62 out of the park, it would steal the recognition
from Fargo and its hero. Others hoped that this year's pursuit of
Maris' record would have the opposite effect, maybe even get Maris
into the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``More people throughout the country know Roger now than did
before, and that might give him a better chance to finally get
in,'' said Wayne Blanchard, 63, who played high school football
with Maris and is chairman of the charity golf tournament.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Fargo will probably face the post-Maris future with
the kind of affable, weatherproof fortitude that greeted Yogi Berra
in 1985. Berra, the Hall of Fame catcher and onetime teammate of
Maris, was in Fargo for the charity golf tournament, and he
reportedly remarked that he did not believe such flat land could
produce enough potatoes to fill up his front yard. A few months
later, 900 50-pound boxes of North Dakota potatoes were trucked to
Berra's home in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the record is broken and we're no longer the site of the
fellow who hit the home-run record?'' asked Cichy, who coached
Maris in all his sports at Shanley High. He paused, considering the
question, and then replied: ``We'll get our snow shovels out. It's
going to be winter before long.''

nation's worst public housing projects and integrate their
residents into mainstream communities.

<P>
   PUBLIC-HOUSING-REFORM (Chicago) _ From Hartford, Conn., and
Newark, N.J., to Denver and San Francisco, the federal government
is working with cities to clear the very slums it helped create:
public housing projects crippled by flawed policies and
mismanagement and overwhelmed by poverty and crime. Hundreds of
thousands of tenants will move to smaller developments that mix
families of different incomes or into privately owned buildings.
</P>
<P>
   But success will require communities to accept as neighbors
people they have long been happy to have out of sight. And one of
the toughest questions facing housing officials is how to deal with
intensely troubled families, whose problems could cripple their
adjustment to a new home or harm their new neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is the challenge greater than at Chicago's Robert Taylor
Homes, the nation's largest housing project, much of which is
``considered the worst slum area in the United States'' according
to its landlord, the Chicago Housing Authority.

CALIFORNIA, L.A. COUNTY LEAD NATION IN LATINO POPULATION GROWTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By YVETTE CABRERA  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- California beat all other states and Los Angeles
County topped the nation's counties with the most increases in
Latino population in the 1990s, according to a new Census Bureau
report.
</P>
<P>
   With an impact on everything from politics to business, the
growth spurt came as no surprise to local Latinos who believe the
increase is driving a booming economy and voter participation.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The population growth) has had a significant impact on
business,'' said Hector Barreto, chairman of the Latin Business
Association, based in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   California gained 2.2 million Latinos from 1990 to 1997, for a
total Latino population today of 9.9 million, according to the
Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program.
</P>
<P>
   The Latino population increase in California has created a
market that has boosted small-business growth in Los Angeles
County, where one of every two start-up businesses is Latino-owned,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When small businesses get started, they are primarily
dependent on similar ethnic communities for their business,''
Barreto said.
</P>
<P>
   In California alone, the consumer buying power of Latinos makes
up almost one-third of all the group's buying power in the nation,
or $112 billion out of $348 billion in buying power nationally,
according to 1997 statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by this buying power, Latino-owned businesses in the
county have more than tripled from 80,000 in 1987 to 250,000 in
1998, a number that is expected to double every five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The success that we're experiencing here in California is
being propelled by small businesses,'' Barreto said. ``There's a
lot of job creation and tax revenue that's going on there.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of registered Latino voters also has risen
dramatically over the last 10 years, from 1.35 million in 1988
compared with 2.3 million today, according to the Southwest Voter
Registration Education Project, a nonpartisan group in Montebello
working to increase Latino participation in politics.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Latino elected officials in the state also jumped
from 693 in 1996 to 789 in 1998 to represent 4.2 percent of total
elected officials in California, according to the Los Angeles-based
National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials.
</P>
<P>
   However, considering the population increase, these numbers
should be higher, said Rosalind Gold, NALEO's senior director of
naturalization programs.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, which ranked a distant second behind California with a
Latino population of 5.7 million, had a significantly higher number
of Latino elected officials with 1,749, or 6.3 percent of the total
elected positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``That says we still need to work on translating the growth in
the Latino population into political participation,'' Gold said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' high numbers are partly attributable to the state's
higher number of elected and appointed positions and to a longer
tradition of Latino mobilization, Gold said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the high Latino population, Latino voting strength won't
reach its potential until more Latinos become citizens, Gold said.
Less than half of Latino adults are citizens in California, she
added.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you can see that no matter how much the population keeps
growing, if you have one out of two adults who aren't citizens and
can't participate, that is a major barrier to having the strength
of the population represented at the polls,'' Gold said.
</P>
<P>
   Latinos represent about 11 percent of the U.S. population, with
an estimated 29.7 million Latinos out of a population of 268
million Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Texas and Florida ranked second and third in Latino growth,
respectively, with gains of 1.4 million and 531,541. California,
Texas and New York have the most Latino residents.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County's Latino population rose from 3.4 million in
1990 to 4 million in 1997, far outdistancing Dade County, Fla.,
which was second with a 185,582-person gain to 1.1 million Latinos.

ILL CLARK PACES RANGERS BY DRIVING IN FOUR RUNS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ First baseman Will Clark established his
reputation during the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   It remains intact a decade later.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, the victim of a strength-zapping virus, arrived at The
Ballpark in Arlington yesterday ``feeling worse than he did''
Wednesday evening in Detroit, Rangers manager Johnny Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark took two _ make that two, two-run base hits _ and likely
will feel better this morning after the Rangers' 9-3 victory last
night against the Twins.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the reason he's Will Clark,'' Oates said after the
victory that cut the first-place Angels' lead in the American
League West to two games, with Anaheim playing host to Kansas City
in a game played later last night.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Aaron Sele, who perhaps threw his best pitch during
the first inning, allowed only one earned run in his seven-inning
appearance and coasted to his 17th victory.
</P>
<P>
   Sele escaped a one-out, bases-loaded jam by inducing an
inning-ending, double-play ground ball from Twins left fielder
Marty Cordova and let Clark's swing produce more than enough
offensive support.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's two-run, third-inning single gave the Rangers a 3-0
lead, and his two-run, sixth-inning double only enhanced his
reputation as a player who can be counted on during September and
October when it matters most.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight was extra special,'' Oates said. ``He didn't have much
strength, but he's the type of guy who rises to the occasion. You
don't get to be that type of player without coming through again
and again.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark will enter tonight's game against the Twins and
right-hander Bob Tewksbury hitting .417 (5-for-12) with two
doubles, a home run and seven runs batted in during the Rangers'
first three games of September.
</P>
<P>
   The 34-year-old first baseman entered this season with a .306
average for his career during this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``September is a fun time,'' said Clark, who Wednesday delivered
a go-ahead, run-scoring double during the sixth inning before
leaving feeling ill. ``You've worked for seven months to try to
make the playoffs, and we're down to our last 22 games now.''
</P>
<P>
   That also serves as the reason Oates plans to pitch
right-handers Sele and Rick Helling every fifth day the remainder
of this season.
</P>
<P>
   Sele's latest performance represented his fourth victory in as
many starts. The right-hander also owns a 2.15 earned-run average
during that span.
</P>
<P>
   Sele (17-10) escaped another bases-loaded situation and
prevented the Twins from a multiple-run frame during the fifth
inning by retiring Twins first baseman David Ortiz on strikes. The
other two runs Sele allowed were unearned after a seventh-inning
error by second baseman Mark McLemore.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we want from our starters,'' Oates said. ``Give us
six or seven innings and give us a chance to score some runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Producing runs falls under Clark's department, especially in
September.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I've worked for,'' Clark said, ``to be in this
position now.''

PARCELLS WILL START ROOKIES ONLY IF HE MUST. HE MUST. 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ While leading a New York Giants team on its
way to the Super Bowl, Bill Parcells could virtually boast to his
rookies: ``I don't need you.''
</P>
<P>
   But he needs them now.
</P>
<P>
   He needs them despite his fears that rookies are, well, rookies.
For, while his New York Jets remain in a rebuilding mode, Sunday's
season opener at San Francisco is not going to be delayed until his
first-year players learn a thing or two.
</P>
<P>
   If you count punter Nick Gallery, who has never played a
National Football League game but was on the practice squad last
year, the Jets will start three rookies against the 49ers. The
others are right tackle Jason Fabini, a fourth-round draft pick out
of Cincinnati, and Kevin Williams, a third-rounder out of Oklahoma
State.
</P>
<P>
   Pepper Johnson remembers the 1986 season with the Giants, when
he was one of a remarkable core of second-round picks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tuna told the team, `We had a good team in 1985, so I don't
need any rookies. Just play a role.''' So Johnson, a linebacker,
sat and watched, as did defensive tackle Erik Howard and cornerback
Mark Collins.
</P>
<P>
   In contemplating rookies, Parcells likes to refer to George
Allen's contention that for every first-year player you start, you
lose a game.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to Gallery, Parcells worries not so much that he
is an untested player but that he is a kicker. Kickers seem born to
aggravate Parcells; it is the one area of football that makes him
almost want to shirk his coaching duties.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Parcells seems reasonably comfortable with Fabini.
``Normally, you equate rookies with mistakes,'' he said. ``I will
say this in Jason Fabini's case: This kid has been one of the
rarest rookies I've ever had. This kid makes zero mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been 10 years since a rookie tackle started the opener
for the Jets. In 1988, the rookie was the first-round pick Dave
Cadigan of Southern California. The last time before that was 1978,
when Chris Ward of Ohio State went right into the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Fabini recalls this year's rookie camp and a lecture: ``Coach
Parcells gave us four things he wanted us to do to help us make the
team. One of them was `no mental errors.' Another was `be
reliable.' The other two, I've forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Williams, he quickly demonstrated speed and agility
during training camp. When the Jets drafted him, they thought he
might be a cornerback. They also wondered about him at strong
safety, and they liked his ability to return kickoffs. They even
tried him on special-teams coverage. In the final exhibition game,
he was at free safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``We overloaded him until we decided what to do with him,''
Parcells said.
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS:
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bill Parcells, feeling hamstrung by having to bring three
specialists to the game _ John Hudson, just for long snapping; Nick
Gallery, for punting, and John Hall, for place-kicking _ is
contemplating designating Vinny Testaverde as his third
quarterback, or 46th man. Under that designation, Testaverde's
appearance in a game before the fourth quarter would mean that both
Glenn Foley and Ray Lucas could not play the remainder of the game.
If Testaverde entered in the fourth quarter, Foley and Lucas would
still be eligible.

THINGS CHANGE STRETCHES SARATOGA STREAK TO THREE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ Nothing could be sweeter for a juvenile
filly than to win at Saratoga, unless it is winning twice at
Saratoga, or three times. And that is what Things Change achieved
Friday when she won the 107th running of the Spinaway, casting the
glow of tradition and promise on a career with a three-race winning
streak.
</P>
<P>
   The streak began on Aug. 2 when she won in a six-furlong race,
and gathered luster on Aug. 17 when she won the Adirondack, the
middle race in the cycle of three stakes at Saratoga for 2-year-old
fillies. And it gained star quality Friday when Things Change shot
to a four-length victory in the Spinaway, one of Saratoga's oldest
and most important stakes for young horses.
</P>
<P>
   She was joined in the spotlight by her trainer, Linda Rice, a
34-year-old from Wisconsin who got her start by working as an
exercise rider and assistant to her father, Clyde, who trained
horses. The family now develops young horses and operates two
training centers near Ocala in the Florida horse country.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Rice took two years away from racing to study computer
science at Penn State, but returned to the track and went on her
own as a trainer 11 years ago. She passed a milestone Friday when
she made the winner's circle at Saratoga for the sixth time this
season, the fourth time after a graded stakes and the third time
with her striking gray filly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was especially excited with this race,'' she said, ``because
it was my first Grade I victory. But she broke a touch flat-footed,
so right away I was concerned because I wanted to see her closer to
the lead. She was pushed back at the start, and I felt that we
needed to be closer.''
</P>
<P>
   Things Change ran sixth in a seven-horse field for half a mile
while Jose Santos let her settle down. Appealing Phylly, meanwhile,
was setting a fast pace, which included the first quarter-mile in
22 1/5 seconds and the half-mile in 45 3/5. But by then, Things
Change had overcome the poor start, and she charged into the lead
as they turned for home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pace was quick, so for the first quarter of a mile I just
took hold of my filly,'' Santos said. ``I waited until the turn; I
just wanted to take my time and get her to the outside. When I did
that, it gave her a clear shot.''
</P>
<P>
   At the finish, Things Change had four and a half lengths on
Extended Applause, who also ran second in the Adirondack. And
Extended Applause, in turn, had three lengths on Miss Jennifer
Lynn. The winner ran the seven furlongs in 1 minute 24 4/5, paid $6
for a $2 bet to win and added $120,000 to her growing bankroll.

<P>
   FINISH LINES:
</P>
<P>
   Mike Smith left the Albany Medical Center on Friday wearing blue
sweat pants, a T-shirt and an Anaheim Angels baseball cap given to
him by Chris DeCarlo, a fellow jockey. ``I'm a New York Yankees
fan,'' Smith said, ``but Chris gave this cap to me because he said
I must have had an angel on my shoulder the other day.'' On Monday,
Smith's mount was trapped in traffic and flipped him into the hedge
lining the track at Saratoga. Smith was also wearing an upper-body
cast to support the two vertebrae he fractured in the spill. Dr.
Allen Carl, his orthopedic specialist, said that Smith would return
to the hospital for evaluation in three months. ... Smith was the
leading rider at Saratoga when he was injured, but was not likely
to hold his lead in the final four days of the meet. Jerry Bailey,
who was overtaking Smith in the standing, withdrew his appeal for
careless riding on July 23, and will serve a 10-day suspension
starting Monday. Also, in separate cases, Shaun Bridgmohan withdrew
his appeal and Aaron Gryder lost his appeal. So both also will
serve 10-day suspensions for careless riding.

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ST. LOUIS _ Two heroes danced among the mortals Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   They were mammoth figures. Timeless, mythic and larger than
life. One was Mark McGwire, the Cardinals slugger with arms like
cannons and a calm voice that belies the gunpowder drive that has
him chasing a legend.
</P>
<P>
   The other was Babe Ruth, who descended from wherever it is that
hard-living, hard-hitting gods spend eternity and was the legend
whom McGwire chased.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment McGwire stepped onto the Busch Stadium field
hours before Friday night's game against Cincinnati, it was clear
to those of us who once could only imagine the awe that surrounded
Ruth that we no longer had to imagine.
</P>
<P>
   This was it. This was Big Mac chasing the great Bambino on a
breezy, warm night. They were here. McGwire and Ruth. You could see
one of them. You could feel the other.
</P>
<P>
   Appropriately, considering the many ties that connect these
giant heroes, McGwire received a reception that few baseball greats
have earned before. Maybe only one other baseball hero has seen
what McGwire saw, felt what McGwire felt. Only Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   We know now that McGwire indeed will eclipse the single-season
home-run record belonging to former Yankees great Roger Maris.
Chicago Cubs power merchant Sammy Sosa probably will do it, too.
But outside of Chicago and a few other Cubs havens, it is McGwire
who captivates the imagination and boggles the mind.
</P>
<P>
   And it is because McGwire is baseball's Ruth, while Sosa is its
Maris. McGwire is larger than life. Sosa is having a very good
year.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Pete Rose thrilled us two decades ago by giving Joe
DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak a little scare. Cal Ripken Jr.
warmed the heart when he chased and caught Lou Gehrig's record of
2,130 consecutive games played. Rickey Henderson was electric when
he broke Lou Brock's mark of 938 stolen bases.
</P>
<P>
   But none of those feats compared to this. Those were records
grounded in reality, to say nothing of being grounded on the
ground. Those were hustling records, consistency records,
perseverance records. Those were marvelous. But they were not
majestic, monumental and high above the mortals, like the shots
that whistled off Ruth's bat and now sail off McGwire's.
</P>
<P>
   There was a collective gasp from the 48,076 fans who came hoping
to see history Friday night. There were women hanging over railings
and shouting McGwire's name, begging for a look from the handsome
hero, or maybe even a wink of the eye or a doff of the cap.
</P>
<P>
   There were men carrying children on their shoulders, pointing to
McGwire and telling their sons and daughters, ``That's him,'' as if
a godlike figure had appeared, a Ruth-like figure.
</P>
<P>
   During batting practice, McGwire did what Ruth did. He caused
everyone, including the opposing team, to stop and watch. He tugged
on the bill of his batting helmet, flexed his shoulders and began
punishing baseballs, whacking seven shots over the fences. Home
runs bounced off the facade of the upper deck, planted themselves
in the grass over center field and rattled the Plexiglas in the
luxury suites.
</P>
<P>
   The sound of leather hitting wood sent shivers down the spine.
It was a remarkable display of power by McGwire and unconditional
love from his fans. It was Ruthian.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, McGwire swung mightily in the game, often too
mightily, striking out twice on an 0-for-3 night. He never managed
to hit the historic 60th. It was as if Ruth, watching and reveling
in the scene, tapped McGwire on the shoulder and said, ``Not
tonight, kid.''
</P>
<P>
   But it will happen. And when McGwire smacks his 60th to tie Ruth
_ perhaps today _ he will forevermore be connected to a legend with
whom he has more in common than Maris, Sosa or any other.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth, like McGwire, was a massive man. Ruth had big, paw-like
hands and stood 6-2, with a barrel chest. Ruth, like McGwire, also
helped save the game.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Chicago Black Sox gambling scandal of 1919,
Ruth gave baseball a new dimension with his unfathomable power. He
gave baseball new life. McGwire today has done the same, bringing
back all those fans who vowed after the 1994-95 strike never to set
foot in another big-league ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth, like McGwire, didn't just hit home runs. He shot them to
the skies like a baseball god. So does McGwire. On the way to
Friday night's encounter with Ruth's legend, McGwire's 58th home
run traveled 497 feet, his 59th 458 feet. Compare that to Sosa's
56th, which traveled about 340 feet, barely squeezing over the
basket in right field at Wrigley.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth, like McGwire, suffered through a poor season not long
before his record-setting campaign. In 1925, Ruth's carousing
lifestyle led to a struggle at the plate and nearly 60 games missed
with injuries. In 1991, McGwire hit just .201 with 22 homers in 154
games. People wondered about him, too.
</P>
<P>
   But now, McGwire is on a Ruthian streak. Before Friday, he had
hit 12 home runs in his previous 16 games. In 1927, on the way to
60, Ruth finished with a streak of 10 home runs in his final 17
games.
</P>
<P>
   These are legends, so different but so alike. Sometime soon,
McGwire will get No. 60. And somewhere, Ruth surely will plop a
shot of bourbon into his beer, take a long drag on a cigar and
grumble, ``Attaway, kid.''

SPEECHES OK, BUT PITCHING MUST DELIVER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Is it too late for the Dave Valle speech?
</P>
<P>
   You remember, the one-for-all and all-for-one inspirational
message that ignited the Rangers in their drive to the American
League West title in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Can we get Dave on the phone? Fly him in from Seattle for the
day?
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe manager Johnny Oates has it all on cassette and he can
just gather the troops around and turn the volume on the tape
player up as loud as it will go.
</P>
<P>
   Valle delivered that soul-stirring speech on Aug. 9, 1996,
before a game in Toronto and the day after a devastating loss to
the Tigers in Detroit. He said exactly what needed to be said at
exactly the right time.
</P>
<P>
   Valle's words, as the Rangers began their final 23-game drive to
overtake the Anaheim Angels with a 9-3 victory against Minnesota
last night at The Ballpark in Arlington, ring as true today as they
did two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It is time for the Rangers to rededicate and recommit
themselves. Time to spend September focused on one thing and one
thing only: winning.
</P>
<P>
   Time to put away the bows, the guns and the Big Berthas. Time to
stop the talk of postseason hunting trips and the golf vacations.
Time to concentrate on winning each and every game. Time to talk
ball and only ball.
</P>
<P>
   That was Valle's message in '96. With an intuitive sense of
timing, the veteran backup catcher understood that the loss in
Detroit and a scalding postgame lecture from Oates had left the
players open and ready for a positive push in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   In front of the entire team, Valle went around the clubhouse, to
each individual player, asking them to commit themselves to each
other for the final seven weeks of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers responded by winning seven straight and nine of 10.
They eventually built their lead to 10 games, allowing them to
withstand a harrowing near-collapse in the season's final two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   With only 22 games remaining, it would seem timely for someone
to try and find that magic again. But who?
</P>
<P>
   There is no Valle in the Rangers' clubhouse this season, more's
the pity.
</P>
<P>
   Will Clark? He has the fire and the know-how, but his daily
duties as the team's ``Sheriff'' sometimes provokes teammates to
tune out his often shrill message. Besides, Clark may be more
intent on leading by example, as last night's four clutch RBI would
seem to indicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're way past speeches,'' Clark said. ``We've got a lot of
veteran guys in this room. They know what has to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark McLemore? Another likely choice, except he has had to focus
almost all his energy on his own sore knees, shrinking batting
average and mounting error total.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think speeches are going to do it,'' McLemore said.
``We just have to go out and do our jobs. We have to get all phases
of the game done: pitching, hitting, and defense. Not one out of
three, not two out of three, all three.''
</P>
<P>
   John Wetteland? Ah, now you're onto something. He's articulate,
intense and he has been there. He knows what it takes. Such
speeches, however, rarely seem to come from pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, the perception is that the Angels are winning the West
because they want it more, that they're a bunch of over-achievers
playing with grit and determination. Sounds like the '96 Rangers,
doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   While that may be at least partially true, the reality is that
the Angels' team earned-run average (4.44) is almost three-quarters
of a run better than the Rangers' (5.13), who rank second to last
in the American League.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we pitch decent,'' Oates said, ``we'll win this sucker. But
we can't give up eight or nine runs a game. If we can hold 'em to
four, we'll win.''
</P>
<P>
   It's so simple and yet so true. If they pitch well, the Rangers
have the better team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have nobody to look at but ourselves,'' McLemore said. ``I
think things will work out. I think we'll win.''
</P>
<P>
   It was difficult to tell whether it was a declaration or a
prayer.

SOX HELP KEEP TORONTO ALIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ If the Red Sox want to inspire hope where there is
none, this is the way to do it.
</P>
<P>
   But it will take more than their most one-sided loss of the
season, a 12-1 beating at the hands of the Toronto Blue Jays under
a full moon and open SkyDome roof Friday night, to cause tremors to
be felt through the Red Sox clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not sitting here like, `We got blown out. Wow. What
happened?''' said Mo Vaughn, to whom all divining rods point at the
first hint of trouble on the Olde Towne Team. ``It hasn't happened
too much to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays, who have Roger Clemens on deck this afternoon,
are a season-high nine games over .500 and within seven games of
the Red Sox in the American League wild-card chase after winning
their eighth straight.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, meanwhile, have lost six of their last nine and haven't
won consecutive games since Aug. 26. With 23 games left, they have
a 6 1/2-game lead over the Texas Rangers, 9-3 winners over the
Twins Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just go play tomorrow,'' Vaughn said. ``We're facing one
of the best pitchers in the game tomorrow, but we got our guy (Bret
Saberhagen) going, and he throws the ball pretty good, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not hanging on strings till the situation takes shape.
Just play the game. If it doesn't happen tomorrow, it will happen
the next game.''
</P>
<P>
   It certainly didn't happen Friday night. With Nomar
Garciaparra's 23d error of the season and seventh in the last 14
games setting the tone in the first inning, the Blue Jays won their
second in a row over the Red Sox. After exploiting more Red Sox
sloppiness afield to open a 4-1 lead, they broke the game open with
a seven-run seventh inning fueled by Jose Canseco's three-run home
run off Tim Wakefield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I stunk,'' said Wakefield, whose yield of eight
runs was one more than the season-worst seven he had given up
twice, including his last start. ``I couldn't keep us in the game
long enough. I gave up a home run to Canseco that opened up the
game a little bit. That's something I'm not accustomed to doing,
and I don't like to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, Garciaparra staggered fill-in first baseman
Mike Benjamin with a hard sinker that Benjamin barely held on to.
Friday night, with plenty of time to throw out Canseco, who is not
known for overexerting himself down the line, Garciaparra bounced
one past Mo Vaughn at first, an error that led directly to the Blue
Jays' first two runs.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Green, who had singled and taken third on the error,
scored on a passed ball, Canseco advancing to third, and Canseco
scored on Carlos Delgado's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   After Mike Stanley of the Red Sox and Darrin Fletcher of the
Blue Jays exchanged bases-empty home runs in the second, Toronto
went ahead, 4-1, in the third when Green's drive hit the base of
the left-field wall and caromed past Troy O'Leary. By the time
O'Leary ran the ball down, Shannon Stewart, who had been hit by a
pitch, scored, and Green took third when O'Leary overthrew two
cutoff men.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Scott Hatteberg dropped Green's foul popup with two out
in the fifth, and Green hit the next pitch for a double, but the
Blue Jays didn't make the Sox pay for that error as Canseco
grounded out to short.
</P>
<P>
   There was no getting off the hook the next time, however, in the
seventh. Craig Grebeck doubled and scored on Stewart's single to
make it 5-1. The Sox pitched out on the next play, correctly
guessing that Stewart would be stealing, but catcher Jason Varitek,
who had entered as a pinch hitter in the seventh, was unable to get
a grip on the ball and never made a throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never got it out of the glove,'' Varitek said.
</P>
<P>
   A clearly annoyed Wakefield snatched Varitek's toss back to the
mound, then intentionally walked Green. On his first pitch to
Canseco, he hung a knuckleball over the middle of the plate that
Canseco promptly turned into an hors d'ouevre for someone dining in
the Windows Restaurant, his 38th homer crashing off the glassed-in
restaurant located in the second deck of SkyDome.
</P>
<P>
   That was all for Wakefield, though there was still more agony
for the Red Sox to endure. Lefthanded reliever David West, proving
to be no more effective for the Sox this time than he had been on
his previous go-round, gave up a single to Delgado and walked Jose
Cruz. When he went ball one on Tony Fernandez, Jimy Williams yanked
him for Carlos Reyes.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez hit Reyes's first pitch over the head of center
fielder Darren Lewis for a two-run double, and Fletcher singled
home Fernandez to make it 11-1. Green, who had four hits on the
night, hit his 30th home run in the eighth, making him the first
30-30 player in Toronto history (30 homers, 30 steals).
</P>
<P>
   At game's end, Williams stood behind his desk, still wearing his
Red Sox jacket, arms folded, as reporters filed into his office. He
got off the first question.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are ya?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When the question was redirected to him, he shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you play 162, you're going to have some like that,'' he
said. ``What are you going to do? Get ready for tomorrow's game.
That's all you can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do I feel? I feel like eating.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one of Williams's strengths, Vaughn would say later,
taking the big losses and the big wins with the same pulse rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know Red Sox Nation is quick to panic,'' he said. ``But
Jimy keeps it regulated. He keeps it all together.''

DODGERS BEAT GIANTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Dodgers knew they weren't seeing the real Shawn Estes. They
hope they haven't been watching the real Mark Grudzielanek.
</P>
<P>
   After 31 games with the Dodgers, Grudzielanek finally hit a home
run, a three-run shot Friday night that helped in an 8-5 victory
over the San Francisco Giants in front of 35,182 at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It paled in distance to one Charles Johnson hit in the sixth
inning and it hardly compared to the Giants' Barry Bonds, who had
four hits and two walks to set a National League record by reaching
base in 15 consecutive plate appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek's home run was big for Dodgers starter Darren
Dreifort (8-12). It helped build a 6-0 lead he didn't give back
even though he allowed two-run homers to Ellis Burks and Armando
Rios.
</P>
<P>
   For Rios, who was called up Tuesday, it was his first
major-league hit. For Dreifort, who allowed eight hits and four
walks in seven innings, it was his second straight victory after
going winless in six consecutive starts.
</P>
<P>
   For the Giants, who are hoping Estes regains his 19-victory form
from 1997, Grudzielanek's homer was bigger. After missing a month
with a sore shoulder, Estes lasted just five innings and his team
dropped three games behind Chicago and New York in the National
League wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   But Grudzielanek's homer was biggest for the Dodgers, who are
trying to learn about their future in the final three weeks of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   With no guarantees where many players will wind up after the
season, Friday was was proof there is pop in Grudzielanek's bat.
Since he arrived from Montreal in a July 31 trade, Grudzielanek has
been an excellent defensive shortstop, but he only has three extra
base hits. In 1996 with the Expos, he was lousy in the field but
had 54 doubles.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have a dilemma. Opening Day shortstop Jose Vizcaino
has not played since June 21 when he sprained his right ankle. He
has two years and $6 million left on his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman/leadoff hitter Eric Young, who has just six
stolen bases in the second half after stealing 32 in the first
half, has three years and $14 million left on his contract.
Grudzielanek is making just $300,000 but is eligible for salary
arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   Young also played a big part Friday night, with three hits,
including a two-run single off Estes (7-9) in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort breezed until the middle innings, allowing just a Bonds
single and two walks until the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   But Burks reached on an infield single and stole second to open
the fifth. Dreifort struck out the next two batters, forcing Giants
manager Dusty Baker to make a decision. Estes was on a pitch count
of 90 and had made just 72.
</P>
<P>
   Baker left Estes in the game and he singled to left. But Matt
Luke made a perfect throw to the plate to hold Burks. After walking
leadoff hitter Marvin Benard, Dreifort struck out Bill Mueller to
end the inning, but he no longer was dominant.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds opened the sixth with a single to center, the 13th
consecutive time he reached base. And for the second straight time
in the game, he was thrown out by Johnson trying to steal second.
</P>
<P>
   When Jeff Kent struck out, Dreifort appeared out of trouble. But
then he walked J.T. Snow and Burks crushed a 1-1 fastball deep into
the left-field stands for a 431-foot homer.
</P>
<P>
   It was Burks' 20th home run and ended a string of consecutive
scoreless innings by Dodgers starters at 232/3. That included five
by Dreifort, nine by Carlos Perez on Wednesday, seven by Ismael
Valdes on Tuesday and the final 22/3 by Chan Ho Park on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Estes left after five, but the Dodgers weren't done. The Giants'
new pitcher, Chris Brock, walked Roger Cedeno to open the sixth
then allowed Johnson's 18th homer to right-center.
</P>
<P>
   In the top of the eighth, Bonds doubled to left, tying the NL
record set by Pedro Guerrero in July 1985, when he was a member of
the Dodgers. Then in the ninth, he singled off Jeff Shaw to set the
national-league record of 15, one short of the major-league record
held by Boston's Ted Williams, who made it 16 in September 1957.

ROYALS RALLY TO BEAT ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM BARRERO  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ It was supposed to be the make-or-break road trip, the
one that would show if the Angels really had what it takes to win
the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   And after going 6-4 against the AL's best _ New York, Boston and
Cleveland _ the Angels returned to Edison Field on Friday night
saying they had nothing on their minds but the road ahead.
</P>
<P>
   That focus wasn't lost on the Kansas City Royals as Anaheim
clawed back from a two-run deficit, only to see the Royals score
two ninth-inning runs off closer Troy Percival for a 5-3 victory in
front of 33,832 fans.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had their lead over the Texas Rangers in the West cut
to 1{ games. Texas defeated Minnesota, 9-3, Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``That road trip's over ... It's done,'' Angels manager Terry
Collins said. ``We've gotta stop talking about it. What we just did
there (back East) has no bearing on what we do now.''
</P>
<P>
   The players seemed to take that attitude to heart for most of
the night in what could easily have been a letdown situation
against a Royals team that was 11 games under .500 and 13 games
behind Cleveland in the AL Central heading into the game.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until the late innings that things finally collapsed
for the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals took the lead on a pinch-hit single to right by
veteran Terry Pendleton off Mike Holtz (2-2), scoring Hal Morris
for a 4-3 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   An opposite-field bouncing single to left by Johnny Damon off
the outstretched glove of third baseman Troy Glaus scored Mike
Sweeney with an insurance run.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City closer Jeff Montgomery came on in the ninth to
record his 32nd save of the season, picking up a double-play
grounder from Randy Velarde to quell a potential rally.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Tim Salmon's seventh-inning, two-out single on reliever
Chris Haney's first pitch scored Velarde to put the Angels ahead
3-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals tied it at 3-3 in the bottom of the seventh on Dean
Palmer's 101st RBI of the season and his third of the game when his
two-out blooper to left-center landed just past the glove of diving
center fielder Jim Edmonds, allowing Damon to score.
</P>
<P>
   Damon led off the inning with a slow tapper to second, but
reached base when Velarde charged and threw wildly to first.
</P>
<P>
   After giving up two runs in the fourth inning, Angels pitcher
Ken Hill, in only his second start since being activated from the
disabled list on Aug. 28, seemed to get stronger.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, who pitched seven innings, retired 10 of the final 14
batters he faced, allowing only one to reach second base. He walked
three and struck out six, including Jose Offerman three times.
</P>
<P>
   Hill also received some key defensive help in the seventh after
Morris led off with a single to right. Larry Sutton followed with a
deep fly to right that Garret Anderson caught a few feet from the
warning track before firing to second to double up Morris trying to
tag up from first.
</P>
<P>
   Royals starter Pat Rapp, whose 11-11 record coming into the game
is testament to what has been an inconsistent season for the
31-year-old, showed those same traits early in the game.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed only two hits through the first four innings before
letting the Angels tie the game at 2-2 in the bottom of the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   After Glaus started the inning with a single to left-center,
Rapp induced flyouts from Charlie O'Brien and Gary DiSarcina,
looking as if he would put another inning away.
</P>
<P>
   But then the trouble really started. Rapp walked Edmonds and
Velarde, setting the stage for Anderson. Even then, Rapp looked
like he would escape, but Anderson's grounder to the hole at short
thrown on a bounce into the Royals dugout by Mendy Lopez, allowing
Glaus and Edmonds to score.
</P>
<P>
   On the way by, Anderson's cleat accidentally spiked first
baseman Jeff King in the right heel, forcing him out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City took a 2-0 lead in the fourth inning, also using an
error to at least get things started. Damon reached on an error by
Gary DiSarcina at short and moved on to third when Jeremy Giambi
doubled off the scoreboard in right.
</P>
<P>
   Two batters later, the duo came home on a rocket double to
left-center by Palmer, pushing him to the 100-RBI mark for the
second time in his career. Palmer's career high is 107 RBI in 1996
with the Texas.

SOSA BLASTS NO. 57 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ The third pitch he saw of the night was really a
ball. Well, it would have been a ball if he hadn't swung at it. But
Sammy Sosa swings bats very well. So well that Friday night he was
able to send a fastball 401 feet at Three Rivers Stadium and wipe
out a 68-year-old Cubs record in one motion.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to know the Cubs right fielder to understand the
items that go into his daily diary. You are living his diary with
him. He now has 57 home runs, one more than Hack Wilson had in 1930
_ which stood as both the club and National League record until
Sosa and Mark McGwire started playing home run derby this summer.
The only person who wasn't happy about that was a young man named
Jason Schmidt, the Pirate righthander who gave up the first-inning
solo homer during the Cubs' 5-2 win. Everyone else? Happy.
Especially Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how far you hit a home run,'' Sosa said after his
shot, ``it's still a home run.''
</P>
<P>
   And it doesn't matter what an official scorer rules, as long as
a run scores. That's a reference to the ninth inning, when Sosa
grounded to third baseman Freddy Garcia, who misplayed the ball and
allowed the tie-breaking run to score. The official ruling was that
it was an error. Sosa thought it should have been a hit. No matter.
The Cubs maintained their one-game lead over the Mets in the
wild-card race and Sosa continued to stoke home run imaginations
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Remember: He's just as excited about this pursuit of Roger Maris
_ and McGwire _ as you are. Each time McGwire went to the plate
Friday night in St. Louis, the at-bat was shown on the stadium
scoreboard here. Sosa peeked a few times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking,'' Sosa said. ``I'm a Mark McGwire fan.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Sosa was asked why he always calls McGwire
``The Man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has 59 home runs,'' Sosa replied, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa is now within two home runs of season leader McGwire and
five away from breaking the major league record set by Maris in
1961. With each homer, Sosa knows the crowds will grow. He knows
some of the fans will boo, as many among the 36,510 (the Pirates
drew just over 8,000 Thursday) did Friday night in the fourth
inning. Sosa's crime? He did something silly. He singled. And his
teammates were worse. They actually played a game, when they should
have known everyone was here to watch Sosa swing. Right?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hilarious when crowds get up to leave late in the game
after Sammy has batted,'' first baseman Mark Grace said. ``I'm
like, `Hey, don't you want to see me and my 14 home runs?'''
</P>
<P>
   Long after Sosa sent Schmidt's 2-0 pitch into the right-field
stands, the Cubs lounged in their locker room and did what everyone
does these days. They watched McGwire. ``I know how you feel, Big
Mac,'' Grace said as McGwire fell behind in the count. He would
eventually strike out. The Cubs went back to their conversations.
</P>
<P>
   This has been Sosa's routine for the last eight weeks. It
usually begins with a glance at the highlight shows, a prayer, a
chat with the media, a home run or two during the game, an ovation
from a home or opposing crowd (``I feel like this is my house,'' he
said of Three Rivers Friday night), and, by nightfall, a summary of
his previous 20 hours or so. We hope you're having fun during this
season. Sosa is. You said something about pressure?
</P>
<P>
   ``Pressure?'' he said. ``This isn't pressure. Pressure for me
was when I was back home, a shoeshine boy. Yeah, I was a shoeshine
boy. Trying to make money for my mother.''
</P>
<P>
   That was in the Dominican Republic, where Sosa's bats were tree
branches or slabs of wood. Baseballs were actually socks with
rubber taped in the middle of them. Word is that the stroke was
good even then. He said he dreamed of coming to the United States
back then, and since coming here, he hasn't stopped saying, ``I
love this country.''
</P>
<P>
   He repeated that phrase at least four times Friday. Someone told
him he sounded like boxing promoter Don King.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Sosa said, smiling again. ``I say, `God bless America.'
He says, `Only in America.'''
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that Sosa is enjoying the publicity. He knows no one
expected him to be in this race. Know how many home runs he had as
of May 24? Nine. By that time, McGwire had 24. But the next day,
Sosa hit two home runs and hasn't stopped swatting balls into the
skies of Pittsburgh, Chicago, St. Louis, Los Angeles, New York ...
</P>
<P>
   Since May 25, Sosa has outhomered McGwire, 48-35. But he doesn't
mind if more people are rooting for McGwire. He is rooting for him,
too. He expects Americans to root for the powerful redhead. Just as
many in the Dominican Republic expected Leonel Fernandez, the
president of the country, to call Sosa after he hit his 56th home
run to tie Wilson's record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark McGwire is the man here, but I'm the man over there,''
Sosa said. ``If he goes there, I'll pass my _ how do you say? _ my,
uh, my crown to him for the day he's going to be there. And after
he leaves, I'll take it back.''

   CLINTON-APOLOGY (Dublin) _ President Clinton, at a news
conference in Ireland in the wake of Sen. Lieberman's critical
speech, says ``I'm sorry.'' By John M. Broder.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-LIEBERMAN (Washington) _ Sen. Joseph Lieberman, a
longtime political supporter of Bill Clinton, said Friday that it
was conversation around his family's meal tables during a beach
vacation that prompted his taking the Senate floor the day before
to denounce the president. By Katharine Q. Seelye. (With photo.)
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-KIDS (New York) _ America's children, some as young as
7, are aware that President Clinton was unfaithful to his wife, but
they seem less interested in the sexual details of the White House
scandal than the moral shortcomings of a man who would deceive and
hurt his family. By Jane Gross. (With photos.)

<P>
   CHICAGO-GIRLSLAIN (Chicago) _ Prosecutors in Chicago dropped
their murder case against a 7-year-old and 8-year-old boys who
police said confessed to attacking a girl riding her bicycle in
their neighborhood. A crime laboratory report issued to prosecutors
showed the presence of semen in the 11-year-old girl's underpants.
Police crime experts said it's highly unlikely that boys so young
could produce semen. By Pam Belluck.
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-RDP (Peggy's Cove, Nova Scotia) _ As grieving families
from several countries began to converge on this tiny fishing
village on Friday, officials looking for the cause of the crash of
Swissair Flight 111 on Wednesday said that it appeared that the
crew was in control of the jet and making rational decisions about
how to land the stricken plane until it abruptly disappeared from
radar. By Randy Kennedy and Matthew L. Wald. (With photos.)
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-VICTIMS (Undated) _ The dark waters swallowed 229 lives

<P>
   CRASH-DITCH (Undated) _ Despite the demonstrations by flight
attendants on how to inflate a life vest, and instructional videos
on how passengers should operate the life vests, the chances of a
pilot successfully ditching a stricken aircraft in the water are
very slim. By Andrew C. Revkin.
</P>
<P>
   LIBERAL-PRIEST (Rochester, N.Y.) _ When the Rev. James B. Callan
says his last Mass at Corpus Christi Roman Catholic Church on
Sunday, he can look back on a 22-year ministry that packed the pews
on Sunday and created a battery of programs to help the poor, but
that also moved so far away from standard church practices
regarding the roles of women, gays and non-Catholics in the church
that he has been removed from his job. By Gustav Niebuhr.
</P>
<P>
   ND-MARIS-HOMETOWN (Fargo, N.D.) _ While most of the country is
gripped by irrepressible excitement as Mark McGwire of the St.
Louis Cardinals and Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs move ever closer
to the magic number, people in Fargo are wrestling with more
complicated feelings. They are grateful for the sudden flood of
recognition being paid their cherished hometown hero, Roger Maris,
but they are achingly aware it is more of a requiem than a
coronation. By Pam Belluck. (With map.)
</P>
<P>
   MILLON-YOUTH-MARCH (New York) _ Intent on preventing any
outbreaks of violence, the Police Department plans to saturate the
site of Saturday's planned rally in Harlem with as many as 250
officers along each of the six blocks set aside for the event. By
John Kifner.
</P>
<P>

   RUSSIA-POLITICS (Moscow) _ Hours after Russia's acting prime
minister finally laid out his program to pull the country out of
its economic crisis, Parliament Friday put off a crucial vote on
the new government until Monday, buying more time for political
negotiations. By Celestine Bohlen.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-ASSESS (Moscow) _ As Viktor Chernomyrdin has battled to
become prime minister, critics have wondered how he could placate
the Communists and still take tough steps to rescue Russia from its
deepening economic crisis. By Michael R. Gordon. (With graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   RWANDA-TRIBUNAL (Arusha, Tanzania) _ A U.N. tribunal sentenced a
former prime minister of Rwanda to life in prison on Friday for his
part in the 1994 genocide there, despite his agreement to plead
guilty and to testify against other high-ranking officials. By
James C. McKinley Jr.
</P>
<P>
   NKOREA-MISSILE (Tokyo) _ North Korea said on Friday that the
purpose of its launching on Monday of a two-stage rocket was to
carry a satellite into orbit, not to test a missile. It denounced
Japan and other countries for jumping to the conclusion that it was
launching a new class of missile. By Nicholas D. Kristof.

   GREENSPAN (San Francisco) _ Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve
chairman, signaled Friday that the central bank is now less
concerned about inflation as a threat to the U.S. economy but is
increasingly wary that the spreading global financial crisis could
harm the United States. By David E. Sanger with Richard W.
Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   ECON-REPORT (Washington) _ The labor market rebounded in August
as GM workers returned following the strikes' settlement. The
unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.5 percent. Payrolls rose by
365,000 jobs, in line with forecasts. Workers' average hourly
earnings, a gauge of business costs, rose half a percent, or 7
cents, after having increased 0.2 percent during July. By Sylvia
Nasar. (With graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   CORPUS-CHRISTI-TOURISM (Corpus Christi, Texas) _ Corpus Christi,
a socially conservative and heavily Hispanic city, has few
spectacular natural assets or claims to fame. Instead, it has gone
about its pursuit of tourism in a methodical manner, investing
millions to try to overcome some difficult strokes of geographical
misfortune. And success is already evident in the rising number of
visitors. By Edwin McDowell. (With graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   BRAZIL-ECON (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) _ With Brazil's stock

billion a day to defend the currency, economists warned that Latin
America's biggest economy could pull the region into a recession.
By Diana Jean Schemo.
</P>
<P>
   MARKET (New York) _ The stock market flirted with the bears
again Friday, as the Dow Jones industrial average fell below where
it closed Monday, the day of the 512-point, 6 percent plunge that
shook investors here and around the world. But in the last-half
hour, the Dow and other indexes rebounded, cutting their losses by
two-thirds and more. Still, the Dow was off 5.1 percent for the
week and gave up most of Tuesday's 288 point rally. By Jonathan
Fuerbringer.

intellectuals on the left have been attempting a reconciliation
after a long period of estrangement. By Steven Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   LURIE-NOVELS (Undated) _ It has often been said Alison Lurie
writes comedies of manners. That, she admitted in a recent
interview, is more accurate than saying she writes ``tragedies of
morals.'' The truth is that her novels are comedies of manners and
morals, which explore the lives of the literati and the
relationships between the sexes in academia. By Mel Gussow. (With

THERE IT GOES: SOSA CONNECTS FOR NO. 57 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BILL DEDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire aren't giving Mark
Grace much time to work out his etiquette problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having a hard time deciding what to do,'' said Grace, the
Chicago Cubs' veteran first baseman. ``If Sammy gets to 62 home
runs _ or let me say, when Sammy gets to 62, we would usually mob
him at home plate. That's the record. But if McGwire gets to 62
first, do I just give Sammy a handshake when he does it? It won't
be the record anymore. This is a crazy year.''
</P>
<P>
   Grace's dilemma moved closer Friday night, as Sosa hit his 57th
home run in the first inning of the red-hot Cubs' 5-2 victory over
the Pittsburgh Pirates. The Dominican hit a high, outside fastball
an estimated 401 feet into the seats in right-center field at Three
Rivers Stadium. The homer came on a 2-0 pitch from right-hander
Jason Schmidt.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa received a huge ovation from the 36,510 fans in Pittsburgh,
and he replied with a tip of his cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm in my house right now,'' Sosa said of the
reception.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the ninth inning, Sosa knocked in the game-winning run
when his hard-hit infield grounder was mishandled.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs _ who have won five in a row _ remained one game ahead
of the New York Mets and two games ahead of the Giants, pending San
Francisco's result at Los Angeles later Friday night, in the NL
wild-card race. If they hold on, it would be the Cubs' first
playoff appearance since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa moved back to two homers behind McGwire in the race to beat
Roger Maris' single-season record of 61 home runs set in 1961.
McGwire went 0-for-3, walking once, in the Cardinals' 3-2 loss to
Cincinnati Friday night in St. Louis, and remained at 59 home runs.
One player or the other has homered on five straight game days.
</P>
<P>
   The two sluggers are threatening to outpace the field in the
manner of Babe Ruth _ or Secretariat. Fans and reporters talk
endlessly of a player's pace for the season. But a better indicator
might be their recent performance. If they were to extend their
success of the past three weeks, McGwire and Sosa would end up with
71 and 68 home runs, respectively. McGwire has 22 games remaining,
and Sosa has 21. In their previous 22 games, each player has hit an
extraordinary 12 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's turns at bat in St. Louis were shown in Pittsburgh on
the giant video screen in center field, irking the Cubs, who
believe it encourages Sosa to swing for the fences. ``I like to
wait till after the game to know,'' Sosa said.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire and Sosa now rank one and two on the historical list of
home runs in a season by a National League player. They are trailed
by Hack Wilson, who held the National League and Cubs record of 56
from 1930 until Tuesday. Next on the list is Ralph Kiner, who hit
54 for the Pirates in 1949, the best post-war effort before this
year.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire was expected to challenge the record. After all, last
year he hit 58 with Oakland and St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   But Sosa? His previous career high was 40. How does a hitter
improve his power so much?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm seeing a lot more pitches this year,'' Sosa said before
Friday night's game, entertaining a gaggle of reporters before
batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   His news conference was moved from his locker to the field,
because the crush of cameras is now too great.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa might have Grace, or Manager Jim Riggleman, to thank for
his jump in productivity. Last year on the last-place Cubs, Sosa
hit fourth in the lineup, in front of Ryne Sandberg (.264 batting
average) and Shawon Dunston (.284). This year he is followed by
Grace (.319) and Brant Brown (.303).
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He leads the NL in runs batted in and total bases, and his
batting average of .313 is much higher than his pre-1998 career
average of .257. He has waited more patiently for pitches, hitting
more than one-fourth of his home runs to the opposite field. He has
homered in 15 straight series and at least once against every NL
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``For McGwire, every at-bat is a home run, a walk or a
strikeout,'' Grace said. ``Sammy is pushing us into the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, Sosa went 2-for-5. Leading off the fourth inning,
Sosa hit a single to left, took third on a single by Grace and
scored. In the sixth, he struck out, and in the eighth, he reached
on an error.
</P>
<P>
   After three games here, Sosa and the Cubs fly to St. Louis to
confront McGwire and the Cardinals on Monday afternoon and Tuesday
night. The Cubs scratched their rookie star pitcher, Kerry Wood,
from Sunday's lineup because of a sore elbow on his pitching arm.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa said the record might not wait until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark is very, very focused right now,'' Sosa said. ``He's
going to hit some this week. He's very into breaking the record
this weekend. He's not going to wait for me. I hope that he breaks
it before I go over there. That will make it easier for me.''

VETERAN OF '87 SEES LITTLE CAUSE FOR ALARM 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By PETER TRUELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the world's stock markets wobble wildly, Asian economies sink
into recession, Russia slams the door on its creditors and U.S. and
foreign financial institutions make provisions for billions in
losses, the Treasury and the Federal Reserve are hastily dusting
off their primers on financial crisis management.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the current turmoil, few of the world's financial leaders
have much to say publicly. But some who have seen markets plunge
before believe the reaction to recent events is overwrought.
</P>
<P>
   One is E. Gerald Corrigan, who as president of the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York for a decade was the nation's financial
fireman at the time of the 1987 stock market crash.
</P>
<P>
   There is suddenly too much pessimism, Corrigan said in an
interview last week. Stressing the current capital strength of the
U.S. financial system and the absence of major credit problems, he
argued that the world was better positioned to withstand stress
than it had been in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly all news is bad news, after a period when all news is
good news,'' said Corrigan, 57, now a managing director at Goldman,
Sachs &AMP; Co. ``The truth, as always, lies somewhere in between.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview from Montana, where he was on vacation after the
Kansas City Federal Reserve's annual conference in Jackson Hole,
Wyo., Corrigan underscored that he is now a Wall Streeter, without
inside knowledge of government efforts to deal with the new round
of turbulence. It has been nearly five years since he stepped down
as president of the New York Fed after a long career.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as Corrigan readily acknowledges, there is some truth to the
maxim ``Once a central banker, always a central banker.'' And he is
married to one, as well; last October, he wed Cathy Minehan, the
president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. Corrigan, the Fed
and Goldman, Sachs have all said they have established procedures
to guard against potential conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   While the roots of today's turmoil are structural problems in
Asia's economy _ weak banking systems, for example, and Japan's
paralysis _ the surprise is that Russia is now roiling world
markets, Corrigan said. He called the country ``kind of the wild
card.''
</P>
<P>
   That, he said, is ``because while its economy is nowhere near
big enough to have much effect on world markets,'' it has caused
``political anxiety, and its contagion effect has been greater than
anyone expected.''
</P>
<P>
   What ``got markets very nervous'' about Russia, he said, was the
government's declaration, effectively, of a unilateral moratorium
on paying both foreign and domestic bonds and its further
moratorium on the foreign currency liabilities of Russian
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Such steps are anathema to central bankers, Corrigan said. Debt
moratoriums ``fundamentally seem to be so in conflict with the
whole fabric of the credit system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This raises the question: If it could happen there, could it
happen somewhere else?'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Corrigan argued, the prospect of debt repudiation is not
as threatening as it was in the 1980s. ``If you look at the system
as a whole, we are not nearly as leveraged as we were in the mid-
to late '80s,'' he said. ``Some institutions will take some lumps
here. But none of this should be remotely life-threatening for the
system.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That is a sharp contrast to the days after Black Monday in 1987,
when the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 22.8 percent in a
single trading session. ``If you go back to the stock market crash
of '87, especially the Tuesday or Wednesday, every newspaper was
laden with stories about credit problems,'' Corrigan recalled.
``That's not the question today.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the question today is how to prevent the collapse of
economies in countries ranging from Thailand to Russia. Asked what
remedies he might suggest, Corrigan referred to ``Sovereign
Financial Crises: Facing Realities and Building a More Secure
Future,'' a paper he wrote in May. It strongly suggests that
prevention is far preferable to searching for cures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once a crisis strikes, the country, its creditors, its
investors and the official community are left with nothing but bad
choices,'' the paper states. Corrigan argues instead for better and
more prompt dissemination of economic information, tougher
conditions on lending, increased financial resources for the
International Monetary Fund and stronger banking systems.
</P>
<P>
   From his office at Goldman, Sachs, Corrigan has had a hand in
trying to manage some of the recent crises. He has advised South
Korea and Thailand as those countries seek to pull themselves up
from Asia's continuing woes; earlier, he consulted with the Mexican
and Argentine governments.
</P>

   At the New York Fed in the early 1990s, Corrigan also worked
with Russian leaders, forming a friendship with President Boris
Yeltsin and becoming chairman of the Russian-American bankers'
forum, which has sought to provide training and technical help to
the Russian banking system.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the current tangle of international financial problems,
Corrigan keeps faith in the world's ability to withstand the
current buffeting. ``Financial markets are really quite
resilient,'' he said. ``They really can handle most things _ unless
there is the perception or reality of major credit problems in the
system.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Americans who never fought a war or feared a
depression could be forgiven for imagining a risk-free world.
Living high and mighty, consuming more than their share of the
world's food and fuel, feeling secure within their borders and even
reasonably safe outside them, they could envision a boundless zone
of security in which American money and power and culture and
technology would insure some sort of peace.
</P>
<P>
   But when markets tumble into turbulence, wiping out $4 trillion
of the world's wealth, and a plane to Switzerland _ home of stolid
banks and precise watchworks _ plummets from the sky, and the
United States hurls missiles at an armed theosopher in Afghanistan,
inviting retaliation against American emblems everywhere, the odds
in the big casino can feel like they are shifting back to the
house.
</P>
<P>
   At least subconsciously, people calculate those odds every time
they board a plane or take a flier. Today the well-off may have
reason to feel at risk: They have more to lose, more creature
comforts, more paper profits. Global crashes can stir the
survivalist inside the most confident suburbanite.
</P>
<P>
   Risk was a great thing when new worlds and new frontiers
beckoned and the risk-takers had little to lose. Now millions of
people crowd the coasts, living in more expensive properties built
more shoddily than a generation ago, and more vulnerable to oceans
and storms and quakes. Beyond the nation's borders, in the world's
financial markets, people are also living nearer to the edge, in
riskier ways, closer to the winds of rising storms. As prosperity
has grown, risk has grown with it.
</P>
<P>
   How do people deal with invisible global forces? Mostly, they
don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no reference point to calculate our probabilities,''
said Howard Kunreuther, co-director of the Center for Risk
Management and Decision Processes at the Wharton School. ``So, we
forget. It's very costly to be scared every moment. We say, `This
isn't going to happen to me.' And then we're surprised if it
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Is the world really more risky than it was 40 years or 40 days
ago? If so, why? As the rigid Cold War past melts into the fluid
present, where the chances of being vaporized by a nuclear bomb
from Vladivostok are down, but the chances of being wiped out by a
currency crash in Jakarta are up, calibrating these dangers is
complicated. It has energized an increasingly interesting field:
risk analysis, a school of thought built from risky business:
managing nuclear power, launching rockets, building dams, curing
cancers, combating terrorists, buying insurance, managing mutual
funds and pension plans, playing the markets _ the gamut of global
gambles.
</P>
<P>
   Risk, it turns out, can be quantified. But a sense of security
cannot.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is risk?'' asks Yacov Haimes, president of the Society
for Risk Analysis. ``Risk is measurable, and composed of two parts:
What could go wrong and what are the consequences? Now, safety is
something else. Safety is the level of risk that's acceptable to
you. Today in America we are seeking more comfort. We can afford
more comfort. We expect more comfort. Go to Phoenix, in Arizona _
in a desert, they have lawns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, is our world more dangerous?'' he said. ``It is. We are
asking more of it, more comfort and therefore we are more
vulnerable. The more secure we are, the more we feel the danger of
losing our security. There are easy ways to inflict major pain with
no major effort. People can intrude on our financial and
national-security systems in much easier ways. This is because of
the interconnectedness of the world and its infrastructures.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This interlinkage,'' a presidential commission warned in
October, ``has created a new dimension of vulnerability, which,
when combined with an emerging constellation of threats, poses
unprecedented national risk.''
</P>
<P>
   This more interwoven world may remind people of an old
high-school biology lesson: that everything is connected to
everything else. It calls to mind a principle of chaos theory _
that a butterfly flapping its wings in Mexico can set off a chain
of disturbances that causes a hurricane in China.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, a plunge in the Indonesian rupee causes chaos
with the Russian ruble _ and, conceivably, with the U.S. Treasury,
and millions of mutual funds, pension plans and young children's
college savings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not only my small world any more,'' said Kathleen S.
Gurney, chief executive officer of Financial Psychology Corp.,
which counsels investors, investment advisers and companies on
risk-taking. ``My world extends into places I have no way of
gauging. I am dealing with psyches I don't understand any more. My
sense of prediction is no longer as solid and as true for me. I
don't have the same self-confidence I had two weeks ago. If I'm
feeling this way, others must be feeling this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Others in the world of the calculated risk do share that
assessment. ``In fact, there is more risk,'' said Tom Hutton,
president of Risk Management Solutions, Inc. ``Risks are being
driven by a more complex set of factors.'' Hutton feels safer
flying than driving, but the airport he uses, in San Francisco,
``handles dramatically more flights than it used to, so the risk
there increases exponentially.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Go back to the butterfly that can cause a hurricane,'' he
said. ``When you see the linkages between something happening in
Indonesia, a country most people can't find on a map, and its
impact on the world economy, when you can make those connections
and see the number of things that could cause a world financial
crisis, you see more risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect our borders to provide safety, and they don't
anymore,'' he said. ``When you and I were growing up people had
faith in the government, and that allowed them to be comfortable.
That faith has been disturbed. Both the perception of risk and the
risk itself have changed as people see they have linkages to parts
of the world they didn't think affected them.''
</P>
<P>
   Readjusting people's sense of risk without scaring them
senseless is itself a risky business. When Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan warned of ``irrational exuberance'' awhile ago, he
was saying that Americans were underestimating their risks, and
that the boom (or the bubble) of the '90s was feeding American
culture with the notion that things would always rise and never
fall _ a dangerous idea, since markets, like planes, do crash, and
sometimes for similar reasons, like a loose bolt somewhere in the
big machine.
</P>
<P>
   This may unsettle those who dreamed of a risk-free world. ``How
can people assess their tolerance for risk when they've never had a
loss?'' Ms. Gurney said. ``People have grown up in a society where
they have never experienced terror, never lived through a war,
never gone through a depression. Some have made fortunes overnight.
They began to believe in magic.''
</P>
<P>
   In days gone by, people turned to leaders in times of risk.
``Can you name a world leader who is strong today?'' Ms. Gurney
said. ``Someone we can count on? Someone we can trust? We have no
one we can look toward.''
</P>
<P>
   Another risk miscalculated: A president averse to taking chances
in the public realm risked his political life for seconds of
private pleasure, and so lost power to soothe people who may have
reason to be scared.

   MOSCOW _ It's already autumn in Russia, and as a pleasure drive
along any country road outside the capital will reveal, the
countryside is a riot of beautiful flowers. It is also a riot of
Mickey Mouse beach towels, fresh and not-so-fresh fruit, various
grades of motor oil, stuffed toys, bricks, pillows, used furniture,
just-picked mushrooms and, in at least one instance, gravestones,
available with your choice of inscription.
</P>
<P>
   From the daisies to the markers, they are all for sale, by
householders and their children who sit patiently by the roadside
in straight-backed chairs dragged from their homes, eking out a few
extra rubles in the after hours.
</P>
<P>
   Such riots are one reason there have not yet been riots in the
face of Russia's deepening economic gloom.
</P>
<P>
   Life in Russia is hard _ harder still, because so many expected
better this time. But this is the nation that coped with the Golden
Horde, Ivan the Terrible, the siege of Leningrad and communism and
outlived them all.
</P>
<P>
   Coping is in the national genetic code, a source of humor and
pride and even song: ``Anything but the war,'' goes a refrain from
a popular Soviet-era tune.
</P>
<P>
   In a nation where workers go months without pay, basic services
are spotty and the currency is losing its worth, Russians' ability
to cope may be Boris N. Yeltsin's salvation, too. Americans lose
their cool when that lever on the ice-cube maker gets stuck and the
bin in the freezer isn't replenished. Russians LIVE in a freezer
with not much more ill humor, and considerably more ingenuity.
</P>
<P>
   In Vladivostok, on the Sea of Japan, a prolonged drought this
summer rendered water supplies non-potable and limited working
faucets to but a few hours a day. Strikes and bankruptcies in the
coal industry made electricity a sometime thing at best. The city
is broke and many toilets don't work. By the way, the mayor also
suspended rat extermination last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Some 635,000 people live in Vladivostok, most of whom could not
take regular baths this summer because of the drought. For
entertainment, they turned to hand-cranked generators to power
radios and televisions. To eat, they cooked on Bunsen burners. To
bathe, one woman slept with her faucet turned on, so that a sudden
decision by the water works to begin pumping _ usually in the dead
of night _ would produce a sudden blast of water and awaken her.
</P>
<P>
   This is the sort of things Russians do in place of just
complaining. The woman with the ever-ready bathtub has a friend, an
American who edits The Vladivostok News, who wrote in The Moscow
Times that he left his faucet on, too _ and flooded his apartment.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, coping literally starts at childbirth. The average
Russian family consists of a couple and one child, and few have
more than two. In Soviet times, the reason was simple: children
were too expensive. Moreover, housing was so cramped _ with
husband, wife and in-laws sometimes stuffed into two rooms that
shared a kitchen with three or four other apartments _ that more
children were not only too much to bear but too difficult to create
amid paper-thin walls.
</P>
<P>
   Under capitalism, the apartments are being combined to create
middle-class residences. Unfortunately, all else remains the same
for Russians beneath the middle class, except that their pay is
less than it was and they frequently have been evicted by landlords
seeking better-paying tenants. In such cases, they and their
lower-class country cousins resort to time-honored Russian coping
tactics, honed under years of communism.
</P>
<P>
   The principal ploy, called ``blat,'' is a way of getting
something _ a new carburetor or theater tickets or an introduction
to an employer _ by leaning on someone to whom you have granted a
favor. One might call it string-pulling, but it is really a social
convention, a form of barter that fills a real need that the Soviet
system would not satisfy, and that capitalism so far cannot.
</P>
<P>
   Where blat does not suffice, Russians turn to relatives. Parents
work past retirement to feed their jobless or employed-but-not-paid
children. Rural families get packages from their city relatives;
city folk get food from backyard gardens that have become
absolutely essential to winter survival in the boondocks.
</P>
<P>
   And not only the boondocks. It is seriously believed by some
that Russians have been so compliant in the face of adversity this
autumn because they are so busy tending their gardens and hoarding
for winter; this leaves no opportunity for full-time protest. Some
units of the ill-fed Russian army were granted leave this summer to
pick mushrooms, a national passion that for some has become a
necessity as well.
</P>
<P>
   In some of Russia's most remote reaches, coal miners have been
on strike for months, raising families without drawing pay. They
survive in part on the vegetables and chickens in their yards, in
part on the money their wives earn at jobs or by selling handmade
goods, and in part on a communist-era holdover _ the factory lunch,
which they still get and take home.
</P>
<P>
   There is charity: American-style philanthropy, through Rotary
clubs and similar organizations, is taking root. Submarine-builders
in the Far East who have not been paid for 16 months survive in
part on free bread, doled out through passes from a local baker.
</P>
<P>
   And there is subversion of the system, sometimes called theft.
True to the old Communist notion that the people own the nation's
means of production, workers have been known to quietly claim their
share of coal, autos and other necessities of life.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they cut out the middleman and make the products
themselves. Although Russia's production of raw ethyl alcohol is
dramatically increasing _ up 12 percent in the first half of 1998
from a year before _ the vodka production of government-sanctioned
companies is plummeting. Indeed, legitimate producers of vodka make
up a mere 29 percent of the market, the government said recently.
The rest appears to be controlled by a thriving industry of
bootleggers.
</P>
<P>
   Which suggests that however difficult it is for average Russians
to cope with the collapse of their economy, capitalism has some
life left in it yet.

faucets to but a few hours a day. Strikes and bankruptcies in the
coal industry made electricity a sometime thing at best. The city
is broke and many toilets don't work. By the way, the mayor also
suspended rat extermination last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Some 635,000 people live in Vladivostok, most of whom could not
take regular baths this summer because of the drought. For
entertainment, they turned to hand-cranked generators to power
radios and televisions. To eat, they cooked on Bunsen burners. To
bathe, one woman slept with her faucet turned on, so that a sudden
decision by the water works to begin pumping _ usually in the dead
of night _ would produce a sudden blast of water and awaken her.
</P>
<P>
   This is the sort of things Russians do in place of just
complaining. The woman with the ever-ready bathtub has a friend, an
American who edits The Vladivostok News, who wrote in The Moscow
Times that he left his faucet on, too _ and flooded his apartment.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, coping literally starts at childbirth. The average
Russian family consists of a couple and one child, and few have
more than two. In Soviet times, the reason was simple: children
were too expensive. Moreover, housing was so cramped _ with
husband, wife and in-laws sometimes stuffed into two rooms that
shared a kitchen with three or four other apartments _ that more
children were not only too much to bear but too difficult to create
amid paper-thin walls.
</P>
<P>
   Under capitalism, the apartments are being combined to create
middle-class residences. Unfortunately, all else remains the same
for Russians beneath the middle class, except that their pay is
less than it was and they frequently have been evicted by landlords
seeking better-paying tenants. In such cases, they and their
lower-class country cousins resort to time-honored Russian coping
tactics, honed under years of communism.
</P>
<P>
   The principal ploy, called ``blat,'' is a way of getting
something _ a new carburetor or theater tickets or an introduction
to an employer _ by leaning on someone to whom you have granted a
favor. One might call it string-pulling, but it is really a social
convention, a form of barter that fills a real need that the Soviet
system would not satisfy, and that capitalism so far cannot.
</P>
<P>
   Where blat does not suffice, Russians turn to relatives. Parents
work past retirement to feed their jobless or employed-but-not-paid
children. Rural families get packages from their city relatives;
city folk get food from backyard gardens that have become
absolutely essential to winter survival in the boondocks.
</P>
<P>
   And not only the boondocks. It is seriously believed by some
that Russians have been so compliant in the face of adversity this
autumn because they are so busy tending their gardens and hoarding
for winter; this leaves no opportunity for full-time protest. Some
units of the ill-fed Russian army were granted leave this summer to
pick mushrooms, a national passion that for some has become a
necessity as well.
</P>
<P>
   In some of Russia's most remote reaches, coal miners have been
on strike for months, raising families without drawing pay. They
survive in part on the vegetables and chickens in their yards, in
part on the money their wives earn at jobs or by selling handmade
goods, and in part on a communist-era holdover _ the factory lunch,
which they still get and take home.
</P>
<P>
   There is charity: American-style philanthropy, through Rotary
clubs and similar organizations, is taking root. Submarine-builders
in the Far East who have not been paid for 16 months survive in
part on free bread, doled out through passes from a local baker.
</P>
<P>
   And there is subversion of the system, sometimes called theft.
True to the old Communist notion that the people own the nation's
means of production, workers have been known to quietly claim their
share of coal, autos and other necessities of life.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they cut out the middleman and make the products
themselves. Although Russia's production of raw ethyl alcohol is
dramatically increasing _ up 12 percent in the first half of 1998
from a year before _ the vodka production of government-sanctioned
companies is plummeting. Indeed, legitimate producers of vodka make
up a mere 29 percent of the market, the government said recently.
The rest appears to be controlled by a thriving industry of
bootleggers.
</P>
<P>
   Which suggests that however difficult it is for average Russians
to cope with the collapse of their economy, capitalism has some
life left in it yet.

SURVIVING IN A VIOLENT WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Strahan, the Giants' Pro Bowl defensive end, was chasing
down the Washington Redskins running back Terry Allen, his eyes
locked on the target. Wide receiver Michael Westbrook, running in
the opposite direction with a full head of steam, hit Strahan with
a vicious crack-back block that knocked the nearly 285-pound
Strahan off his feet. Then Westbrook stood over Strahan and
celebrated, pointing a finger in his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was such a cheap shot,'' Strahan said. ``He could have
killed me. But that's life in the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   That life is more violent than ever. While Strahan was not
injured on that play, many doctors, team trainers and National
Football League team executives agree that the increases in the
size and speed of the players today have led to record numbers of
severe injuries, including concussions, ripped ligaments, popped
tendons, even cases of paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the violence that officials and fans do not see,
shrouded by a massive cloak of bodies weighing thousands of pounds.
Kicks in the groin, punches in the stomach, gouged eyes and bitten
fingers and arms are all common in the pileups after tackles.
</P>
<P>
   Strahan and some 1,500 fellow players have spent the summer in
intense, almost militaristic training camps preparing for the
exhilarating but brutal ritual that is the NFL season, which begins
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Players train for a game that is more violent than any other
organized sport, one in which, to be effective, they must reach a
peak of aggressiveness at least 16 times during the season _
regardless of the effect it has on them off the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think about it, it is a strange thing that we do,''
the Giants linebacker Jessie Armstead said. ``During a game we want
to kill each other. Then we're told to shake hands and drive home
safely. Then a week later we try to kill each other again.''
</P>
<P>
   How players deal with that weekly cycle, punctuated by 60
minutes of cold-blooded fury, is an unnerving and largely unstudied
chapter of life in the NFL. But it is apparent from interviews with
dozens of players as well as team officials and psychologists that
a significant number of players are not able to leave that fury on
the field.
</P>
<P>
   The up-and-down cycle of the NFL may affect a player's long-term
mental health and cause strains in the relationships players have
with loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football can take more years off a player's life than drug
abuse,'' said Chris Shannon, a therapist who is coordinator of the
player's assistance program for the San Francisco 49ers and has
worked with dozens of NFL players since 1982. ``I find that
football players spend so much time gearing up for the violence
they have no energy left for anything else in their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   When the game ends, players are asked to become normal citizens
with girlfriends and wives and children. Many are able to make that
transition. Strahan, 26 years old and beginning his sixth season
with the Giants, plays football's most violent position, but
manages to be one of the game's most pleasant men off the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the game is rough,'' he said. ``There are times when I
look at film the day after we play and I can't believe what I see:
the hits, the busted-up bodies. But at the same time, I won't let
the game change me into a maniac.''
</P>
<P>
   Strahan is able to do that, he says, by keeping football in its
proper perspective. He does become extremely focused before a game,
barely speaking to his girlfriend, Jean Muggli, on the couple's
drive from their New Jersey apartment to Giants Stadium, as he
reviews what he has to do. But after the game, Strahan is back to
his outgoing self when the two go with friends to a long dinner or
a movie. Strahan does not let football take control of his life.
</P>
<P>
   But not all players are so successful. For some, leaving the
violence of the game on the field proves harder than winning a
Super Bowl ring. A few bring it home; there have been widely
publicized cases of domestic violence involving the Seahawks
quarterback Warren Moon and the Giants safety Tito Wooten, for
instance.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists who work with NFL players say that lengthy careers
in the NFL may permanently change some players emotionally. John
Hannah, the Hall of Fame guard who played for the New England
Patriots from 1973 to 1985 and is now an investment banker, still
seeks counseling occasionally to help him cope with the absence of
the adrenaline rush he would feel during his playing days, 13 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Hannah says he sometimes speaks with Vietnam veterans seeking
advice, because football players, like war veterans, can suffer the
symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. ``There are cases where
the post-traumatic stress in players rivals that of men who have
come back from wars,'' Shannon said.
</P>
<P>
   Drug use in the NFL has declined drastically since the 1980s,
but it is still a problem, especially cocaine, because it gives
players the same invigorating feeling they get from playing
football, Shannon said.
</P>
<P>
   Players use a variety of means to get themselves ready for a
game. Some isolate themselves from everyone, even family and
friends. Shannon said that players will sequester themselves from
loved ones before games not because they want to focus better, but
because ``they are basically nonviolent people who have to gear up
to see a side of themselves they don't want to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt Millen, who played in the NFL for 10 years and is now an
analyst for Fox, said, ``It's the most unspoken but powerful part
of the game, that deep-seated desire to be better at all costs,
even if it means alienating your family or friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Strahan does not go that far, but he does get quiet, sometimes
grouchy, because his attention is shifting from the everyday
aspects of life to having to deal with the violence on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Carlton Bailey, a 12-year veteran linebacker who is currently
unsigned, said that on the day before a game he would not answer
his telephone or the door and would spend most of the night
alternating between reading passages of the Bible and visualizing
various game scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   Players are not alone in their intense efforts to prepare
themselves for games. They are coached to brutalize their
opponents, to act, as Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor once said,
``like a bunch of crazed dogs.'' Some coaches tell their players to
try and knock out opponents, to knock quarterbacks out of the game
or to take out someone's knees.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists maintain that sometimes players are so intense in
this preparation that the needs of family members become secondary.
That may be why divorce is a significant problem among players,
according to a National Football League Players Association study.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1989 survey of former players, 50 percent of those who
responded said playing in the NFL caused problems in their personal
lives; that figure was 30 percent in 1970. About 33 percent of the
respondents said that they were divorced. Some therapists who work
with NFL players believe the divorce rate in professional football
is over 60 percent.

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the high rate of separation, therapists say, is
that players want to take the same risks in their personal lives
that they do when they play. An extramarital affair may be a way to
recapture the excitement of a blocked punt or a touchdown run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would venture to say there are a lot of marital problems
right before camp starts and during the season,'' said Millen.
``There are probably a lot of arguments between players and their
wives. It happened with my marriage. You have to be selfish,
getting ready for a game that only a handful of people understand.
It's tough on the people around you.''
</P>
<P>
   Millen retired six years ago, after playing for the Oakland
Raiders, the San Francisco 49ers and the Redskins, but his playing
days often come flashing back into his life. Last year, Millen was
playing a game in the family's swimming pool with his then
14-year-old son. When his son started to beat him in the game,
Millen began to feel the competitive urges again. He started to
pile up points against his son. Then more points. And more.
Millen's wife suddenly yelled, ``Matt!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad,'' Millen's son told him, ``you're sick.''
</P>
<P>
   What happens on the field can affect loved ones in more innocent
ways. Once, Strahan got into a fight with a teammate during
practice. They later apologized to each other, but the wife of the
player approached Muggli afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two players get into a fight on the field, they go out over a
beer and it's over, but two years later the wives are still mad at
each other,'' said Muggli, only partly kidding.
</P>
<P>
   Violence has always been a part of professional football. Hannah
recalled a play in his rookie season in 1973 when he ran downfield
and crashed head-on into another player. Hannah felt a ringing in
his ears. When he tried to button his chin strap, he noticed his
helmet was cracked almost in half.
</P>
<P>
   The difference in the 1990s is that the players are bigger and
faster and the collisions more fierce. There are more 300-pound
players than ever. Guard David Dixon and tackle Korey Stringer, the
right side of the Minnesota Vikings' offensive line, weigh a
combined 705 pounds, making them the largest duo in NFL history.
The explosion in speed has been equally startling; it is not
unusual for 240-pound linebackers to run with sprinters' speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times when I don't even recognize the game
anymore,'' said the former Giants quarterback Phil Simms, a Super
Bowl most valuable player who played 14 seasons. ``It's so fast and
brutal.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL seems to understand that more controls are needed; in
recent years several rules have been passed in an attempt to make
the game less dangerous, including more protection for quarterbacks
and a crackdown on vicious chop blocking. But despite the rules
changes, the NFL remains savage.
</P>
<P>
   Equally brutal is the routine, play-by-play battle for physical
and psychological domination. There are bites that nobody sees,
punches in the stomach that go unnoticed and illegal leg-whips that
officials miss. One player said that he urinated on an opponent
last season and that no one noticed except the other player, who
responded with a swift kick to the groin on the next play.
</P>
<P>
   When the Jets tackle Jumbo Elliott played against the Bears
linebacker Bryan Cox last year, before Cox signed with the Jets in
the off season, Elliott smashed hard into Cox on one play, sending
him toppling backward. As they both fell, with the 300-pound
Elliott on top, Cox punched Elliott in the ribs several times. When
they hit the ground Elliott grabbed Cox around the throat. Elliott,
his face inches away from Cox's, then asked a simple question. ``Do
you know who's in control of this situation?''
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Denver linebacker Bill Romanowski spit in the face
of the San Francisco wide receiver J.J. Stokes during a nationally
televised game and it caused an uproar because seldom had that
nasty part of NFL life been caught live on camera. But most players
were not surprised, because such acts are simply extensions of the
game's violence.
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining such constant ferocity can be much more devastating
to the psyche than most players realize, and the effects may last
years after a player retires. Harry Carson, the linebacker who
played for the Giants from 1976-88 (and estimates he had 18
concussions during that time), said he stayed wired for two months
after the Giants won Super Bowl XXI, sleeping only two to three
hours a night.
</P>
<P>
   Another former player said he became addicted to the violence.
Four years ago, craving a physical pounding, he attacked his two
Rottweilers, both weighing more than 125 pounds, punching them,
hoping to instigate an attack. The dogs bit him on his hands and
arms.
</P>
<P>
   Strahan, for one, has been able to remain well-adjusted in the
cold-blooded atmosphere. A second-round draft pick out of Texas
Southern University in 1993, he gained immediate respect from
teammates even as a rookie because of his combination of ferocious
play, professionalism and friendly personality. He has evolved into
a leader on a defense that is among the best in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Football has had few effects on his personal life, Strahan said,
especially since he began dating Muggli four years ago. They became
engaged March 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football hasn't overwhelmed us,'' Muggli said.
</P>
<P>
   But because football is such a demanding sport, one that during
the season requires a 16-hour workday nearly every day, it is bound
to cause stress in even the strongest relationships. Before
training camp or a big game, Strahan can become distant. Muggli
will sometimes make him dinner, serve it, then leave the room so
Strahan can be alone. Therapists say such behavior is normal;
still, it can cause strain.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of weeks before camp, you can feel the tension,''
Muggli said. ``Sometimes I will tell him, `Michael, we're on the
same team.'''
</P>
<P>
   Those times are rare, however, because Strahan works hard at not
bringing his frustrations home. The few times a year when Strahan
gets fed up with football, he often goes golfing to blow off steam
or to a movie.
</P>
<P>
   Some players find it difficult to relax after a game, especially
a loss, not speaking to loved ones or friends until several days
later. Others, like Strahan, go through specific routines that help
them calm down after a game; being social is part of that process.
Strahan, Muggli and friends like to go to a long dinner after a
game, and by the time they get home, usually late, Strahan is
unwound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Movies are great,'' Strahan said, ``because for a couple of
hours you forget about all the craziness that happened on the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bailey was with the Giants in 1993 and 1994, he did similar
things after home games. He would reserve a table for four at a
Manhattan restaurant, sit by himself and watch people sing on
open-microphone night. ``It was nice to be by myself and watch
someone else perform for a change,'' Bailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all players have strategies for handling the football life
like Strahan and Bailey do. Some current or former players may know
they have a problem, but don't seek therapy because it is
considered a sign of weakness, despite such services being
available from the league.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the NFL is believed to have the most sophisticated and
thorough player assistance program in sports. The program, headed
by Lem Burnham, a psychologist and former player for the
Philadelphia Eagles who is vice president of player and employee
development for the NFL, can address almost any player need.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham said the NFL is not violent but physical. The
difference: violence is shooting or robbing someone, he said; the
hard hitting in the NFL is physical.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't mean that violent people don't enter the NFL,''
Burnham said. ``They bring violence to the game; the game doesn't
bring violence to them.''
</P>
<P>
   If players do feel the game is changing them, Burnham said, the
NFL has 150 therapists, specialists in many different fields, on
call to help. Players are promised confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   But when players come into the league, they are not thinking
about the brutality of the sport. They want to make a team, and
they will do anything to accomplish that goal, even if it means
sacrificing their own physical or mental well being.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Cindrich, an agent, conducted a survey this year of 100
highly rated NFL rookies, and 55 percent of the respondents said it
would be worth it even if doctors told them they would require a
knee or hip replacement by age 55.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem I see with a lot of guys is that outside of
football, they have nothing else,'' Strahan said. ``They lose
perspective on life. That's when all of the other problems come in.
When you get ready for a season, when you play during a season, you
want to be focused, play hard, give the game everything you have.
But at the same time you want to keep your perspective on life and
stay grounded. It's hard but it can be done.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, as the stock market tumbled, President Clinton's
political embarrassments deepened and Russia's financial crisis
snowballed, the biggest fear suddenly became fear itself.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the economy is in its best shape in decades,
that unemployment and inflation are remarkably low, the budget is
balanced and the Federal Reserve is content to leave interest rates
alone. The newest worry is that all the scary headlines will so
unnerve consumers _ whose spending has been a key source of the
economy's strength in recent years _ that sheer pessimism will keep
them away from malls, car dealerships and the housing market,
igniting a recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about psychology as opposed to money,'' said Nicholas
Perna, chief economist at Fleet Bank. ``I'm absolutely convinced
that people identify the stock market with the economy. When the
market is tanking, they know things can't be good.''
</P>
<P>
   Perna, revealing something of a pessimistic streak himself, said
he expected the economy to turn extremely sluggish or worse. But
the notion that a national case of the vapors _ as opposed to a
scarcity of jobs, income or wealth _ can cause an otherwise healthy
economy to swoon calls for some skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   As David Wyss, chief economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI, put it
late last week, ``As far as getting spooked, it takes an awful lot
to scare an American.''
</P>
<P>
   Economic forecasters track two monthly indexes of consumer
confidence religiously. Even though economists disagree on how
important consumer confidence is and even what the indexes measure,
they agree that confidence has been hovering at historical highs
for the past few years and that spending has been remarkably
strong.
</P>
<P>
   The older survey of confidence, begun in 1947, is conducted by
the University of Michigan. The newer one was started in the late
1960s by the Conference Board, a New York-based research
organization, and is more familiar to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Each employs slightly different sampling techniques, asks
different questions and tabulates its results at different times of
the month. The Michigan survey is available only to paying clients,
while the Conference Board's index is released to the press.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to gauge consumer confidence, the surveyors are
actually trying to capture the expectations of households in three
basic areas: personal finance, economic conditions and buying
conditions. Both surveys ask five questions, but add others from
time to time to monitor consumers' changing concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In the Michigan survey, two questions focus on the respondents'
financial situation. Two other questions have to do with opinions
about overall economic conditions and the final one asks whether
now is a good time to buy a major appliance. The Conference Board's
questions focus more on job availability and less on personal
finances.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan conducts a phone survey of 500 households and the
Conference Board mails questionnaires to 5,000 households, and
after the answers are collected they are are combined into the
indexes.
</P>
<P>
   Both confidence measures generally move in sync with consumer
spending, and every recession has been preceded or accompanied by a
sharp drop in confidence. Similarly, every recovery has been
preceded or accompanied by a rebound in confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Both the size and duration of the change in confidence make a
difference. It takes about a 10 percent decline over a month or two
to register as a significant shift, and it's not just the change in
confidence but the level that counts. ``Anything above 90 indicates
strong spending,'' said Lynn Franco, an economist at the Conference
Board.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the Conference Board's index was 133, close to the
high of 140 set in the late 1960s. ``It could drop 20 points
without necessarily signaling a sharp slowdown in spending,'' Ms.
Franco said.
</P>
<P>
   The Michigan index is close to 105, also near its high. But
after last week's drop of 411.43 points in the Dow Jones industrial
average, economists will be looking for signs of consumers'
reaction in both September indexes.
</P>
<P>
   There is disagreement among economists as to whether confidence
measures are useful for predicting future spending patterns or
spotting turning points in the economy. The benchmark study of
confidence, published in the American Economic Review shortly after
the 1990-1991 recession, concluded that the indexes are useful but
limited in value.
</P>
<P>
   A more recent study by two economists at the New York Federal
Reserve, Sydney Ludvigson and Jason Bram, suggests that the
Conference Board index may be a more useful indicator. ``Consumers
seem to spend more when they feel good about future job prospects
than they do when they think business conditions are favorable,''
Ms. Ludvigson said.
</P>
<P>
   The most notable episode in which the consumer confidence index
was the first true sign that the economy was heading into a
recession was in the summer of 1990, when Iraq invaded Kuwait and
oil prices doubled within a matter of days. Confidence plunged, and
within weeks spending stalled and the economy was in a nose dive.
Lots of economists, including Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan, were caught by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many drops in confidence are too small or too short to affect
spending. When political events lead to drops in confidence at a
time when the overall economy looks healthy, the drop is almost
always temporary.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1987, for example, the Dow plunged 500 points, or 20
percent, in a single day, and the next month the Conference Board's
index dropped 20 points, to nearly 100. But perhaps because an
export boom was under way, consumers recovered their spirits within
a couple of months, and the index bounced back.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Curtin, the economist who runs the Michigan survey,
points out that by the late 1980s consumers had figured out that
employment, income and economic growth no longer moved in sync with
the stock market _ as they had in the 1960s and 1970s. ``In 1987,
consumers saw no repercussions for income or employment growth from
the stock market decline and therefore mostly ignored it,'' Curtin
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, surges in confidence related to politically
popular events but not supported by improvements in the economy
also tend to be short-lived. Consumer confidence surged after the
Persian Gulf war, but the indexes quickly fell again because the
economy and job growth remained sluggish.
</P>
<P>
   Other economists don't see much of a cause-and-effect
relationship at all between confidence and spending, but see the
indexes as useful nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Confidence is more of a summary measure of things that affect
spending than a specific cause in its own right,'' said Ed
McKelvey, an economist at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In general, forecasters say the real importance of measuring
confidence has less to do with the power of psychology than the
timeliness of the reports. Confidence surveys come out two weeks
before the government's monthly employment reports and a month to
six weeks before reports on consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
   If consumer sentiment reflects their perception of the job
market and business conditions, then it is a convenient preliminary
reading for economists.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no denying it's important, but the main thing that
makes it interesting is that it comes out on a timely basis,'' said
one forecaster. ``If you could see the September employment numbers
or the Conference Board survey, you'd rather see the jobs
numbers.''

<P>
   Last week, as the stock market tumbled, President Clinton's
political embarrassments deepened and Russia's financial crisis
snowballed, the biggest fear suddenly became fear itself.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the economy is in its best shape in decades,
that unemployment and inflation are remarkably low, the budget is
balanced and the Federal Reserve is content to leave interest rates
alone. The newest worry is that all the scary headlines will so
unnerve consumers _ whose spending has been a key source of the
economy's strength in recent years _ that sheer pessimism will keep
them away from malls, car dealerships and the housing market,
igniting a recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about psychology as opposed to money,'' said Nicholas
Perna, chief economist at Fleet Bank. ``I'm absolutely convinced
that people identify the stock market with the economy. When the
market is tanking, they know things can't be good.''
</P>
<P>
   Perna, revealing something of a pessimistic streak himself, said
he expected the economy to turn extremely sluggish or worse. But
the notion that a national case of the vapors _ as opposed to a
scarcity of jobs, income or wealth _ can cause an otherwise healthy
economy to swoon calls for some skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   As David Wyss, chief economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI, put it
late last week, ``As far as getting spooked, it takes an awful lot
to scare an American.''
</P>
<P>
   Economic forecasters track two monthly indexes of consumer
confidence religiously. Even though economists disagree on how
important consumer confidence is and even what the indexes measure,
they agree that confidence has been hovering at historical highs
for the past few years and that spending has been remarkably
strong.
</P>
<P>
   The older survey of confidence, begun in 1947, is conducted by
the University of Michigan. The newer one was started in the late
1960s by the Conference Board, a New York-based research
organization, and is more familiar to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Each employs slightly different sampling techniques, asks
different questions and tabulates its results at different times of
the month. The Michigan survey is available only to paying clients,
while the Conference Board's index is released to the press.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to gauge consumer confidence, the surveyors are
actually trying to capture the expectations of households in three
basic areas: personal finance, economic conditions and buying
conditions. Both surveys ask five questions, but add others from
time to time to monitor consumers' changing concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In the Michigan survey, two questions focus on the respondents'
financial situation. Two other questions have to do with opinions
about overall economic conditions and the final one asks whether
now is a good time to buy a major appliance. The Conference Board's
questions focus more on job availability and less on personal
finances.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan conducts a phone survey of 500 households and the
Conference Board mails questionnaires to 5,000 households, and
after the answers are collected they are are combined into the
indexes.
</P>
<P>
   Both confidence measures generally move in sync with consumer
spending, and every recession has been preceded or accompanied by a
sharp drop in confidence. Similarly, every recovery has been
preceded or accompanied by a rebound in confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Both the size and duration of the change in confidence make a
difference. It takes about a 10 percent decline over a month or two
to register as a significant shift, and it's not just the change in
confidence but the level that counts. ``Anything above 90 indicates
strong spending,'' said Lynn Franco, an economist at the Conference
Board.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the Conference Board's index was 133, close to the
high of 140 set in the late 1960s. ``It could drop 20 points
without necessarily signaling a sharp slowdown in spending,'' Ms.
Franco said.
</P>
<P>
   The Michigan index is close to 105, also near its high. But
after last week's drop of 411.43 points in the Dow Jones industrial
average, economists will be looking for signs of consumers'
reaction in both September indexes.
</P>
<P>
   There is disagreement among economists as to whether confidence
measures are useful for predicting future spending patterns or
spotting turning points in the economy. The benchmark study of
confidence, published in the American Economic Review shortly after
the 1990-1991 recession, concluded that the indexes are useful but
limited in value.
</P>
<P>
   A more recent study by two economists at the New York Federal
Reserve, Sydney Ludvigson and Jason Bram, suggests that the
Conference Board index may be a more useful indicator. ``Consumers
seem to spend more when they feel good about future job prospects
than they do when they think business conditions are favorable,''
Ms. Ludvigson said.
</P>
<P>
   The most notable episode in which the consumer confidence index
was the first true sign that the economy was heading into a
recession was in the summer of 1990, when Iraq invaded Kuwait and
oil prices doubled within a matter of days. Confidence plunged, and
within weeks spending stalled and the economy was in a nose dive.
Lots of economists, including Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan, were caught by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many drops in confidence are too small or too short to affect
spending. When political events lead to drops in confidence at a
time when the overall economy looks healthy, the drop is almost
always temporary.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1987, for example, the Dow plunged 500 points, or 20
percent, in a single day, and the next month the Conference Board's
index dropped 20 points, to nearly 100. But perhaps because an
export boom was under way, consumers recovered their spirits within
a couple of months, and the index bounced back.
</P>

Persian Gulf war, but the indexes quickly fell again because the
economy and job growth remained sluggish.

EX-LITTLE LEAGUERS: THE BOYS OF SUMMER ONCE REALLY WERE BOYS

<P>
   Pictures of the Little League champions from Toms River, N.J.,
standing proudly next to their Yankee counterparts during the
National Anthem at Yankee Stadium last Tuesday did more than give
the kids the second thrill of their lives in a week. They evoked
the fact that the big leaguers once were Little Leaguers
themselves, sporting baggy uniforms and major league dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still remember it like it was yesterday,'' said Paul
O'Neill, the Yankee right fielder, who played Little League in
Columbus, Ohio. ``I remember pitching when I was 12. I pitched the
championship game and struck out a kid named Darren Waugh to end
it. I remember every detail. The games then meant as much to you as
these games do now. And you got to go to Dairy Queen afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 80 percent of today's major leaguers played Little
League baseball _ including players from places outside the United
States, like Panama (Mariano Rivera of the Yankees) and even tiny
Curacao (Andruw Jones of the Atlanta Braves). Eight played in the
Little League World Series. Derek Bell of the Houston Astros and
Gary Sheffield of the Los Angeles Dodgers were on the same Tampa,
Fla., team in 1980. Only one played for a champion: Marc Pisciotta,
a right-hander for the Chicago Cubs, pitched his Marietta, Ga.,
team to the 1983 title.
</P>
<P>
   With or without any national glory, major leaguers look back on
their Little League days more nostalgically as the years pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just had fun,'' said the Yankee shortstop Derek Jeter, who
played in Kalamazoo, Mich. ``You didn't worry about making an error
or striking out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankee pitcher David Wells, already beefy as an 11-year-old
in San Diego, once slammed two home runs in a game, and played
every position but one. ``Catcher,'' he said. ``I refused.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first at-bat as a 10-year-old in Southern California,
Mark McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals hit _ what else? _ a home
run. (Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs, his rival in the current
home-run chase, didn't play Little League ball in his native
Dominican Republic.)
</P>
<P>
   For Cal Ripken, the iron man of the Baltimore Orioles, the
Little League was the place to hone a boy's unabashed love for
baseball. ``I shined my shoes after every game,'' Ripken recalled,
``and sometimes wore my uniform to bed because I couldn't wait for
the next game.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter can't imagine how the Toms River boys withstood the
pressure of playing before 41,200 spectators at the World Series
last weekend in Williamsport, Pa., with millions more watching on
national television.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was young, there were like 12 people in the stands,''
he said. ``And all of them were parents.'' Not that those folks
can't get pretty boisterous themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Alomar, the catcher for the Cleveland Indians, grew up in
Puerto Rico, where baseball is a cultural passion. ``The thing I
remember the most is the competitiveness, and a lot of that has to
do with the parents,'' he said. ``The Little League parents are
even worse in Puerto Rico than they are in the States. They will
scream at the kids for whole games. They put a lot of pressure on
the kids. Every parent thinks their kid is going to play in the
major leagues someday.''
</P>
<P>
   Connie Mack, the Hall of Fame manager for the Philadelphia
Athletics in the first half of the century, looked into the future
with a more discerning eye. In 1954, when he watched the Little
League World Series, he commented to a friend, ``I wouldn't be
surprised if some of these kids made it to the majors.''
</P>
<P>
   He was right. Five players went on to become the first Little
League World Series veterans to reach the big leagues, including
the 1962 National League Rookie of the Year, Ken Hubbs, and the
Baltimore Orioles slugger Boog Powell.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while youngsters dream of reaching The Show, most have
other, more pressing concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had two teams in our area, the Lions and the Expos,''
recalled Chipper Jones, the Atlanta Braves third baseman.
``Everybody wanted to play for the Lions because they had
better-looking uniforms.''
</P>
<P>
   Nolan Ryan, who struck out more batters and threw more
no-hitters than any major leaguer ever, said his fondest baseball
memories were of Little League ball in Alvin, Texas. ``We played
for the love of the game and the camaraderie,'' he said. ``Little
League was the first opportunity for children in Alvin to get
involved in any organized activity. It was one of the biggest
events in our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   So even if the boys of Toms River never won the World Series,
never stood next to the Yankees at the Stadium and never make the
majors, they won't forget their Little League days. Still, it makes
you wonder who some of them might be standing next to in 15 years.

GIANTS, VIKINGS AND NINERS PICKED AS NFC DIVISION WINNERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDITORS: Teams previewed in predicted order of finish
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EASTERN DIVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   1. Giants
</P>
<P>
   1997 RECORD 10-5-1, division champion.
</P>
<P>
   STRENGTHS _ It all starts and stops with the defense. Defensive
end Michael Strahan and linebacker Jessie Armstead, both Pro Bowl
players, were big reasons why the Giants had a league-high plus-25
turnover ratio, third-best in the league since the 1970 merger.
Losing cornerback Jason Sehorn (torn knee ligaments) hurts
tremendously. But the defense remains rock solid and will carry the
Giants back to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   WEAKNESSES _ The running game. Tyrone Wheatley has the speed and
size to be productive, but still doesn't have the support of the
coaching staff. Gary Brown is solid, but he may not be the answer.
The Giants want to use fullback Charles Way as a fulltime running
back, but Way isn't crazy about the idea. Tiki Barber has had his
problems in preseason.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK _ Like last season, the Giant defense will shut down
offenses, the offense will do enough to get by and the coaching
staff, led by Coach Jim Fassel, will find ways to help the team
again win the division.
</P>
<P>
   2. Washington
</P>
<P>
   1997 RECORD 8-7-1
</P>
<P>
   STRENGTHS _ In Coach Norv Turner's fifth year, it is about time
he lived up to his reputation. The Redskins have had winning
seasons the last two years but have not made the playoffs. This
year they have two big guys in the middle who are each a dessert
short of 320 pounds in defensive tackles Dan Wilkinson and Dana
Stubblefield. With that kind of beef, very few teams should have
success running the ball.
</P>
<P>
   WEAKNESSES _ The lasting impression of quarterback Gus Frerotte
is after scoring a touchdown against the Giants last season, he ran
into a wall near the end zone and banged his head into it. He needs
to be more stable, as does wideout Michael Westbrook, who has a
tendency to run undisciplined routes.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK _ Turner will either corral all of this talent and
propel them to the playoffs or they will flounder again. They will
likely make the playoffs and could end up being one of the year's
surprise teams.
</P>
<P>
   3. Arizona
</P>
<P>
   1997 RECORD 4-12
</P>
<P>
   STRENGTHS _ The Cardinals fired offensive coordinator Dick
Jamieson, who was unpopular with the players, and hired Marc
Trestman. The new man runs the West Coast offense, and those
three-step drops and quick passes will work well for the young
quarterback Jake Plummer.
</P>
<P>
   WEAKNESSES _ Offensive line play. Arizona allowed a league-high
78 sacks and was last in the conference in rushing.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK Don't jump on the Cardinals' bandwagon just yet. They
are taking the right steps to get better but they are still a few
years away.
</P>
<P>
   4. Dallas
</P>
<P>
   1997 RECORD 6-10
</P>
<P>
   STRENGTHS _ Only weeks into his tenure as Cowboys coach, Chan
Gailey had to weave his way around ``scissorgate.'' The incident,
in which wide receiver Michael Irvin cut offensive guard Everett
McIver with barber's shears, was truly a bad hair day for Gailey.
But he handled it calmly, and gained the respect of the players.
His offensive smarts and strong backbone are the Cowboys' best
assets.
</P>
<P>
   WEAKNESSES _ They're old. Teams picked apart the talented good
old Cowboys in free agency, and Dallas hasn't drafted as well as
the club needed to replace that talent. Only five starters are from
the drafts between 1993 and '97. By comparison, practically the
entire Giants defense is composed of players they drafted.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK _ Going winless (0-5) for the first time in a dozen
preseasons normally means nothing; except that in the two other
years the Cowboys failed to win an exhibition game, they went on to
losing seasons. The Cowboys' first team offense scored only 3
touchdowns in 15 possessions during preseason. Look for the Cowboys
to finish 8-8.
</P>
<P>
   5. Philadelphia
</P>
<P>
   1997 RECORD 6-9-1
</P>
<P>
   STRENGTHS _ Offensive tackle Tre Thomas may be one of the team's
best draft picks in a decade. Wide receiver Irvin Fryar, playing
for a new contract, will probably have a stellar year. Quarterback
Bobby Hoying has shown spurts of talent.
</P>
<P>
   WEAKNESSES _ Lots. Running back Ricky Watters is gone, and the
Eagles will rely on Charlie Garner, who has a career average of
almost five yards a carry but has also been injury prone. On
defense, Philadelphia signed Hugh Douglas to help pass rush, but
there are still too many holes.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK Ray Rhodes is a smart coach who hasn't drafted well, so
the Eagles are in a sorry state. Unless they pull one of the
biggest surprises of the last five years in the NFL, it is likely
that Rhodes will be fired at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CENTRAL DIVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   1. Minnesota
</P>
<P>
   1997 RECORD 9-7, wild-card team.
</P>
<P>
   STRENGTHS _ The best offense in football. Brad Johnson, a smart
quarterback, is headed to the Pro Bowl. Receiver Cris Carter should
break the 800-catch barrier this season and is headed for the Hall
of Fame. Wide receiver Randy Moss has stayed out of trouble and his
explosiveness has put him on a path to stardom. Throw in running
back Robert Smith, a solid offensive line, and a great coaching
staff and Minnesota could turn the toughest division in football
upside down.
</P>
<P>
   WEAKNESSES _ Before the Vikings make hotel reservations for the
Super Bowl, they will need far better play from the secondary.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK _ The only thing that could keep the Vikings from the
Super Bowl are the wacky moves of the new owner Red McCombs, who
has refused to give Coach Dennis Green, in the last year of his
contract, a new deal until the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   2. Green Bay
</P>
<P>
   1997 RECORD 13-3, division winner.
</P>
<P>
   STRENGTHS _ The usual. Quarterback Brett Favre is an amazing
41-5 at Lambeau Field. Running back Dorsey Levens, despite missing
the preseason because of a contract holdout, should still get his
1,200-plus yards rushing. The Pack's offense is never a problem and
it will still be one of the most formidable in the league.
</P>
<P>
   WEAKNESSES _ The defensive line. Last season, Green Bay finished
ranked 20th against the run, their lowest ranking since 1990. It
must have been embarrassing to be blasted off the ball in Super
Bowl XXXII when the Denver Broncos rushed for over 150 yards and 3
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK _ This division is so stacked that any of the top three
teams could win the Super Bowl. For the Packers, this will likely
be their last run at the Super Bowl with Coach Mike Holmgren, who
could end up in Seattle next year.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   3. Tampa Bay
</P>
<P>
   1997 RECORD 10-6, wild-card team.
</P>
<P>
   STRENGTHS _ Perhaps one of the most unheralded free agent
signings this offseason was Tampa Bay grabbing wide receiver Bert
Emanuel from the Atlanta Falcons in a four-year, $16 million deal.
Emanuel adds some juice to a struggling passing game.
</P>
<P>
   WEAKNESSES _ The Buccaneers will only go as far as quarterback
Trent Dilfer will take them.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK _ The Buccaneers have a great defense, a great coach in
Tony Dungy and a great chance to win the division and go beyond.
But first, they must find a way to beat Green Bay (on a 4-0 streak
against Tampa Bay) and, second, Dilfer has to take his game to the
next level.
</P>
<P>
   4. Detroit
</P>
<P>
   1997 RECORD 9-7, wild-card team.
</P>
<P>
   STRENGTHS _ Running back Barry Sanders and wide receiver Herman
Moore will again be practically unstoppable. Defensive tackle
Luther Elliss, who finished second on the team last season with 8{
sacks, will only get better.
</P>
<P>
   WEAKNESSES _ Quarterback Scott Mitchell. This offseason the
Lions drafted the Eastern Michigan quarterback Charlie Batch in the
second round. Quite simply, if Mitchell doesn't get the Lions deep
into the playoffs, this will be his last year as Detroit's starter.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK _ The Lions may get a playoff spot on talent alone. But
how far they go depends on Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   5. Chicago
</P>
<P>
   1997 RECORD 4-12
</P>
<P>
   STRENGTHS _ A team that won only four games last season has few.
Two of them are running back Edgar Bennett, signed away from Green
Bay, and wide receiver Curtis Conway, when healthy.
</P>
<P>
   WEAKNESSES _ Bad special teams and an average quarterback in
Erik Kramer.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK _ The Bears have bad karma. They stayed away from Randy
Moss in the draft because of his off-field troubles and selected
running back Curtis Enis because he was supposed to not have any.
Then Enis became involved with a controversial religious group, was
accused of sexual assault, and became stuck in a protracted
holdout. The Bears will likely go through another four- or
five-victory season, so expect management to clean house, beginning
with Coach Dave Wannstedt.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WESTERN DIVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   1. San Francisco
</P>
<P>
   1997 RECORD 13-3, division winner.
</P>
<P>
   STRENGTHS _ The 49ers' division schedule is their biggest asset.
Not one of their division opponents finished above .500 last
season, which gives the team a near automatic 9 or 10 victories.
</P>
<P>
   WEAKNESSES _ Possibly at fullback. Marc Edwards has talent but
it will be hard to replace the departed William Floyd, who signed
as a free agent with Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK _ The 49ers are always good. But much of the season
depends on wide receiver Jerry Rice, who is coming back from torn
ligaments in his knee. If he can be the Rice of old, the 49ers
could find themselves in the conference title game again.
</P>
<P>
   2. St. Louis
</P>
<P>
   1997 RECORD 5-11
</P>
<P>
   STRENGTHS _ Quarterback Tony Banks, in the same offensive system
for the second consecutive season, finally has stability _ and no
more excuses. During a dedicated off season, Banks attended 80
percent of his workouts (earning a $25,000 bonus). He also has a
slimmer, more athletic Orlando Pace to anchor a solid offensive
line and a healthy Isaac Bruce at receiver.
</P>
<P>
   WEAKNESSES _ Home blues: Last year the Rams lost six of eight
games at home.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK _ Coach Dick Vermeil ran one of 1998's toughest training
camps. Maybe the hard work will be worth it as the Rams are ready
to make a push to respectability.
</P>
<P>
   3. Carolina
</P>
<P>
   1997 RECORD 7-9
</P>
<P>
   STRENGTHS _ The defense should get back to the top form of
Carolina's 1997 run at the Super Bowl. The front office spent big
bucks this offseason _ including $46.5 million over seven years for
defensive tackle Sean Gilbert. They also brought back linebacker
Kevin Greene and signed the former Pittsburgh Pro Bowler Greg
Lloyd, then spent $22.5 million on cornerback Doug Evans.
</P>
<P>
   WEAKNESSES _ The Panthers still lack a big-play wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK _ Carolina could surprise the 49ers, but only if
quarterback Kerry Collins rebounds from a disastrous season.
</P>
<P>
   4. Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   1997 RECORD 7-9
</P>
<P>
   STRENGTHS _ Chris Chandler has always been a top 10 quarterback,
but he has had problems staying healthy. In games that Chandler
started and finished last year, the Falcons were 7-3. Without him,
they were 0-6.
</P>
<P>
   WEAKNESSES _ The offense is still a conservative, predictable
mess.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK _ Teams in the division will not be caught by surprise
by the Falcons this season. The Falcons didn't do much to improve
since last year via the draft _ because Coach Dan Reeves is a
terrible evaluator of talent _ or even through free agency. And
while the 40-something backup Steve DeBerg is a cute story, it is a
sad state of affairs that Reeves has him as his second quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   5. New Orleans
</P>
<P>
   1997 RECORD 6-10
</P>
<P>
   STRENGTHS _ Punter Mark Royals led the league last year with a
45.9-yard average. The Saints will need him.
</P>
<P>
   WEAKNESSES _ None more obvious than quarterback Billy Joe
Hobert, whom the Buffalo Bills cut last season after he admitted he
hadn't studied his playbook. Last year the offense had a
league-leading 55 turnovers and 33 interceptions. They also allowed
51 sacks.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK _ Linebacker Andre Royal got into a public cursing match
with Coach Mike Ditka last month, then there was a nasty hazing
incident involving numerous veterans and the team's rookies. Both
showed that Ditka has lost control; if the team wins more than five
or six games it would be a miracle.

 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   So I finally got the world's attention! The United States and
Japan thought they could ignore me and _ kersplash _ I send one
missile shooting over Japan, and finally they look in my direction.
Ha! Maybe I should do this more often!
</P>
<P>
   And then they call me irrational. Can't they see that this was
the only rational thing to do? If I didn't scare them every now and
then, they would ignore me totally and I'd be like Fidel Castro, a
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Look at me! The imperialists tried to bully me back in 1994,
telling me I had to stop my nuclear program. But I was ready to go
to war with them, and so they decided to save lives and chicken
out. We reached a big agreement: I would freeze my program and the
Americans and the other countries would give me free heating oil
and build me a $4 billion light-water nuclear reactor. You've got
to be pushy.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Americans tried to double-cross me. Despite their
agreement, they wouldn't lift most of their sanctions, they lagged
in building the new reactor, they delayed shipping me oil and they
didn't even think about normalizing relations.
</P>
<P>
   I was ready to get rid of my whole missile program in exchange
for the right payoff, but they wouldn't cough up the kind of dough
I was talking about. They wouldn't pay me money and they wouldn't
pay attention.
</P>
<P>
   Well, now maybe they'll pay something! If my nuclear program got
them to give me a $4 billion reactor and free oil, think what my
missile program should be worth _ especially since the CIA thinks I
still have a few nukes that I just might figure out how to attach
to a missile. The imperialists were worried about my old Nodong
missiles, which couldn't even reach Tokyo. Well, they missed a
bargain. Now they'll have to pay billions for my program, because I
can take out anything in Japan. And if my engineers can improve the
booster rocket, I'll be able to reach Alaska and Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   OK, OK, I know the missiles are hopelessly inaccurate. But so
what if I aim for the Yankee base at Yokosuka and hit Tokyo
instead? It just makes the Japanese more nervous than ever. And
their fear is what gives me bargaining power.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, and think of all that free advertising I got. The Syrians
and Iranians see Secretary of State yapping puppy Albright denounce
my missiles, and they'll pay more than ever. I'll get paid off one
way or another; by the Yankees for giving up my missile program or
by the Syrians and Iranians for continuing it. These two-stage
rockets can deliver a one-ton payload more than 1,000 miles, and
Israel will be in the bombsights.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, my Foreign Ministry is whining these days. The
diplomats say we may have overplayed our hand, and they're worried
now that Japan has cut off aid and flights to our country, now that
the Yankee Congress is sniveling about whether to back away from
the 1994 nuclear agreement. Huh! Wimps!
</P>
<P>
   Washington will come through because it knows that it would be
risking war if it didn't. Sure, I would lose. But I've got one
thing in my favor: 10 million people within artillery range. Seoul
will be a sea of flames. I have the guts to fight to lose, but the
Yankees don't have the stomach to fight to win.
</P>
<P>
   The imperialists don't really think I'd level Seoul, but they
can't be sure. Sometimes it pays to be perceived as irrational, and
sending a missile racing over Japan just adds to my credibility as
a maniac. (And wasn't it a nice touch when we said later that the
missile launched a scientific satellite transmitting immortal
revolutionary hymns?)
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yeah, sure, if the Yankees do cut off aid, then that will
make it tougher here. But when things get really desperate, people
will come running with aid. If people go hungry here, then the
pressure is on Washington and Tokyo, not me.
</P>
<P>
   I love to read what these foreign analysts say. They think North
Korea is falling apart. It's just like those foreigners who thought
China was falling apart in the early 1950's. But hunger doesn't
make people rebel; it just makes them die.
</P>
<P>
   In China, 30 million people died in Mao Zedong's famine of the
early 1960's; there wasn't a peep of protest. Then Deng Xiaoping
gave the Chinese people pork and rice and they tried to stage a
revolution against him at Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   I'll never make that mistake. I know that contact with
barbarians or, worse, bourgeois democracy, destabilizes a country.
I'll never open up my country the way Deng did.
</P>
<P>
   Those arrogant foreigners think they can make life hard on us
and change us. This is Korea! We're not weaklings. If we were
compromisers our nation would have been absorbed by China or Japan
a thousand years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Two hundred years ago, King Yongjo knew his son would be a
terrible heir, so he locked the weeping young man in a box in the
courtyard and left him to die. It took 13 days. That's the
toughness that it takes to be a king of Korea, and I've got that
toughness.
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean puppets have lost their strength, and we in the
North are the only real Koreans left. That's why we have restored a
dynasty, just like the ancients. My father died four years ago, and
the foreigners all puzzled about why I didn't fill the vacancy and
whether that meant I was weak. Don't they know about filial piety?
If they had read Korean history, they would have known that a good
Korean prince waits several years before succeeding his father. I'm
not a communist. I'm a Confucian.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is my turn to succeed my father as president and party
leader. I'll reform the economy and try to rely more on the market
mechanism, because that's the only thing that works. But I'll never
open up this country. I'll never risk losing control.
</P>
<P>
   I will stand up to the foreigners and my people will stand
behind me, as long as they have the strength to stand. I need
enemies more than I need friends.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes, what a lovely missile that was. It made me a few more
enemies. They can despise me, insult me. But they'll have to
respect me.
</P>
<P>
   Poor little Castro. I should sell him a missile or two to launch
over Florida. Then he would get some respect as well, and maybe
some American foreign aid.

THE HYPE AND HOPE OF READING TO BABY

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For baby's literary enlightenment, the hand that rocks the
cradle should also be turning the pages of ``Good Night Moon'' or
``The Poky Little Puppy.''
</P>
<P>
   At least that's the hope of an assortment of major publishers
seeking to raise a new generation of book buyers. It's also the
goal of a growing number of charities and foundations that have
brought together pediatricians, volunteers and librarians in a less
commercial quest to promote the notion that reading aloud to
toddlers, babies _ even newborns _ is a child-care ritual as vital
as mother's milk.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that there's little evidence that reading aloud
to infants and toddlers has any dramatic benefit. ``The general
consensus is that it's important, but it may be of relatively
modest provable effect based on current research,'' acknowledged
Dr. Robert Needleman, a Cleveland pediatrician and a research
consultant for Reach Out and Read, a national program that
encourages pediatricians to ``prescribe'' story reading for
children at their check-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Needleman added, however, that ``What has been shown is that you
can make small but significant differences in their verbal
ability.''
</P>
<P>
   But the lack of definitive baby-literacy research has not slowed
profit-oriented publishers and literacy advocates _ even as their
logic has come under attack from a provocative new book on
developmental psychology that has generated hyperbolic magazine
headlines about whether parents' efforts to mold their children
really matter very much.
</P>
<P>
   The book, ``The Nurture Assumption: Why Children Turn Out the
Way They Do'' (Free Press), by Judith Rich Harris, maintains that
parents aren't as important as children's peers and society at
large in determining adult behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence suggesting that reading to children makes them
smarter in school is ambiguous evidence,'' Mrs. Harris said. ``The
fact that there is a correlation between reading to a child and a
child doing well in school can be due to different reasons. Perhaps
it does have an effect. But other evidence suggests that's not the
case. That could be due to the genetic effects of parents who like
to read.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Harris questions the view that parents can affect a child's
personality and temperament. ``The nurture assumption is a
20th-century belief that has turned into a myth in a very
exaggerated form,'' she said. ``It has almost become a religion
that parents have to do this and that. And if they don't, their
children will be irrevocably damaged. This has placed a very heavy
burden on parents. They're feeling guilty and intimidated that one
misstep will ruin their child for life.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Mrs. Harris' views about the limits of
parental influence are heresy to reading advocates, though she said
she generally supported reading aloud to babies _ sticking to her
theory that if the broader society and peer groups value reading,
than so eventually will children.
</P>
<P>
   To support the merits of baby literacy, groups like the
Association of American Publishers and the American Academy of
Pediatricians cite the positive impact of reading aloud on brain
development. A fact sheet issued by the publishers' association
summarizing recent research asserts: ``A child-care provider reads
to a toddler. And in a matter of seconds, thousands of cells in
these children's growing brains respond. Some brains cells are
`turned on,' triggered by this particular experience.''
</P>
<P>
   But the scientific evidence is less clear. Richard Aslin, a
professor in the brain and cognitive sciences department at the
University of Rochester, has been studying infants from birth to 12
months old to determine how well they hear speech. By repeating
nonsense words to babies and watching their movements, Aslin said,
his research has shown that babies are quicker learners than
usually given credit for.
</P>
<P>
   ``The brain does develop rapidly very early in life, but it's
not clear whether these kinds of brain development are so critical
that you have to have certain kinds of experiences to develop
normally,'' Aslin said. ``We just don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, efforts to promote baby literacy continue to gather
steam. The William Penn Foundation recently spent more than $2.5
million on a program promoting reading in 300 Philadelphia day-care
centers with more than 18,000 children, many of them under the age
of 3.
</P>
<P>
   The publishers' association and the Boston-based Institute for
Civil Society are planning to imitate this program in other cities
in a campaign tentatively called ``Books for Babies.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Scholastic, a leading publisher of children's
books, is sponsoring a tour by the author Rosemary Wells to promote
``Read to Your Bunny,'' a picture book about the rewards of reading
20 minutes a day to young children. And HarperCollins has been
expanding its line of books labeled for age groups from newborn to
3-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Schroeder, the former Colorado Representative and chief
executive of the publisher's association, has also jumped on the
baby-buggy campaign. For her son's wedding in July, 750 copies of
``Read to Your Bunny'' were donated to Easton Hospital in
Pennsylvania in lieu of traditional gifts to the bridesmaids and
ushers.
</P>
<P>
   These broader efforts might actually have their desired effect,
Mrs. Harris contends _ regardless of a parent's specific
storytelling rituals.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a child grows up in a culture where most of the parents do
read to children and books are important, then that child is going
to pick up that culture, first at home and then when they go out,''
she said.

LONELY STANDS ON CAPITOL HILL 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Week in Review) 
(NOTE TO INTERNATIONAL CLIENTS: For international clients' use by
special arrangement only. Asian and European points: contact Karl

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Joseph Lieberman uncomfortably cast himself in
one of the capital's classic roles Thursday, going to the floor and
demanding ``some measure of public rebuke'' for President Clinton,
an old friend and ally, for his admission of an inappropriate
relationship with Monica Lewinsky. While it was early to talk of
impeachment or resignation, he said, Clinton's conduct ``had
diminished the office he holds'' and was ``reinforcing one of the
worst messages being delivered by our popular culture, which is
that values are fungible.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Washington's favorite images is that of the courageous
senator (why is it almost never a representative?) who breaks with
his party _ or with his president _ for the greater good of the
nation. John F. Kennedy wrote about eight of them in ``Profiles in
Courage,'' most of them from the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   It has happened more recently. In August 1974, Barry Goldwater,
Hugh Scott and John Rhodes (who actually WAS a representative) told
Richard M. Nixon it was time to quit, and he did. But that came
after almost every Nixon defender had left the sinking ship. Early
warnings from two Republican senators, Edward Brooke, a
Massachusetts liberal, and James Buckley, a New York conservative,
had no impact on Nixon's determination.
</P>
<P>
   If one seeks the critical moment in the saga of Watergate, it
was not a speech but the October 1973 firing of Special Prosecutor
Archibald Cox and the consequent firestorm of protest that fatally
weakened the president.
</P>
<P>
   An even slower political death came to Sen. Joseph McCarthy of
Wisconsin. It was June 1, 1950, when his fellow Republican,
Margaret Chase Smith of Maine, said in her first major speech that
the Senate had been ``debased to the level of a forum of hate and
character assassination.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was four years before the Senate mustered the courage to
condemn the communist-hunter who gave his name to irresponsible
investigations that ignore the rights of individuals. The most
effective words came in a Senate committee room in June 1954.
Lawyer Joseph Welch protested the senator's attacks on a junior
attorney and said: ``Let us not assassinate this lad further,
Senator. You've done enough. Have you no sense of decency, sir? At
long last, have you left no sense of decency?''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's attack is most striking because he is among a
handful of senators who are politically close to Clinton. The two
Democrats who followed Lieberman to the floor to praise his
remarks, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York and Bob Kerrey of
Nebraska, are hardly friends of the president. Clinton, responding
Friday, said, ``I can't disagree with anyone else who wants to be
critical of what I have already acknowledged was indefensible.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Lewinsky scandal broke in January, Washington
pundits have been saying that the time might come when Democratic
elders went down to the White House to tell Clinton that, for the
party's sake, he should begin to pack.
</P>
<P>
   One difficulty with this vision is that there is only a handful
of Democrats on whom the president relies, and from whom he might
take such a message seriously. They include former Sen. David Pryor
and Sen. Dale Bumpers, two Arkansans; Senate Minority Leader Tom
Daschle; Sen. Edward Kennedy, Vice President Al Gore and
fund-raiser Terry McAuliffe _ along with Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the conflicted Connecticut senator, the others have
largely kept their own counsel or adopted some version of the party
line that says the American people want Washington to forget about
scandal and deal with campaign finance laws, education or abuses by
health care organizations.
</P>
<P>
   That does remain the clear reading of the polls, though it's
been nearly two weeks since the summer's incessant sampling last
produced a public result _ an August 23 ABC News Poll showing
two-thirds of the public did not want Clinton to resign or to be
impeached.
</P>
<P>
   But Congress occasionally does step out ahead of public opinion,
and that is plainly what Lieberman thought was his duty. His impact
is far less certain.
</P>
<P>
   After all, there were some strong Republican voices in January
1987 demanding that President Ronald Reagan take the blame for the
Iran-Contra mess. Sen. Warren Rudman of New Hampshire, for example,
said, ``The people just hope they don't find out the president
wasn't telling them the whole truth.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, Congress did not test the president's veracity,
and as far as he was concerned, the case blew over.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a displaced stone can start a political landslide.
Sometimes it just falls by itself. &QL;

PATRIOTS, JAGUARS AND BRONCOS ARE AFC DIVISION SELECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Editors: Teams previewed in order of predicted finish.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EASTERN DIVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   NEW ENGLAND
</P>
<P>
   1997 record 10-6, division champion, lost in second round of
playoffs
</P>
<P>
   STRENGTHS _ This team still has the best defense in the
division. It starts with end Willie McGinnest, a mammoth man (6-5,
255) who has the range and power and quickness and to have a career
year. It includes linebacker Chris Slade, a Pro Bowl player last
season with nine sacks. It has a rugged linebacker in Teddy Bruschi
, a top-flight cornerback in Ty Law and a playmaking-safety in
Willie Clay.
</P>
<P>
   WEAKNESSES _ No Curtis Martin. Will the running game click with
rookie running back Robert Edwards from Georgia?
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK _ The Patriots can throw it (Drew Bledsoe to Terry Glenn
and Ben Coates) and they can defend. Their diamonds far outshine
their flaws.
</P>
<P>
   2. MIAMI
</P>
<P>
   1997 record 9-7, lost in first round of playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   STRENGTHS _ Dan Marino. New offensive linemen Kevin Donnalley in
from the Tennessee Oilers. Linebacker Zach Thomas. Newcomer Brock
Marion at safety from Dallas. And a new commitment by the Dolphins
to run the ball and keep running it despite the flavor of each
game.
</P>
<P>
   WEAKNESSES _ Pass rush _ Miami needs plenty more of it. It had
only 31 sacks last season, 23 fewer than conference leader Kansas
City. Losing receiver Yatil Green for the second straight year to a
knee injury hurts badly. His size and speed would have stretched
defenses. Does Miami have a competent burner who can catch the ball
consistently and do that? A receiver who strikes fear?
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK _ If rookie back John Avery from Mississippi maintains
in the regular season what he exhibited in the preseason, the
Dolphins could be on their way. It is a team that should improve
each step of the way.
</P>
<P>
   3.JETS
</P>
<P>
   1997 record 9-7
</P>
<P>
   STRENGTHS _ Curtis Martin gives the Jets a proven tailback and a
tough one. He can catch the ball and convert third downs. The Jets
offense should move the ball with regularity. Fullback Jerald
Sowell packs a punch. Cornerback Aaron Glenn at the top of his game
changes games. The club's special teams have spunk.
</P>
<P>
   WEAKNESSES _ Inexperience at quarterback. Only 29 sacks earned a
year ago. And a much better effort required in divisional play,
where the Jets last year finished 2-6.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK _ This team can win 11 games. It could slip. It needs
plenty of breaks.
</P>
<P>
   4. BUFFALO
</P>
<P>
   1997 record 6-10
</P>
<P>
   STRENGTHS _ Defense. Ranked No. 9 overall last year in defense
despite an offense which kept putting it in terrible positions.
Antowain Smith at tailback appears ready to bust out. The Rob
Johnson/Doug Flutie quarterback duo could be a weapon if Flutie
enters for six or seven plays a game and changes the pace with his
mobility. Bruce Smith _ any team that has him has a tower in
strength.
</P>
<P>
   WEAKNESSES _ It is Rob Johnson's job to lose but no one knows
how this warm-weather guy will stack up in the brutal December,
Buffalo weather. No Chris Spielman at linebacker hurts.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK _ New coach (Wade Phillips), new quarterback, new
offense, new defense. A team in transition.
</P>
<P>
   5. INDIANAPOLIS
</P>
<P>
   1997 record 3-13
</P>
<P>
   STRENGTHS _ Running backs. Marshall Faulk leads the group. He is
an exciting tailback with a tremendous burst in his running. Lamont
Warren is a versatile backup at tailback. He can dip and dive and
juke and slice. Nice player. And then fullback Zach Crockett. Great
size (6-2, 246) mixed with more than adequate speed. And the Colts
have a quarterback in Peyton Manning who excites all around him. A
franchise player.
</P>
<P>
   WEAKNESSES _ The offensive line is a huge question mark. So is
the linebacking play.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK _ The Colts are a team that have wonderful skill players
_ a shiny exterior _ but need more nuts and bolts and strength in
the interior. Expect growing pains.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CENTRAL DIVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   1. JACKSONVILLE
</P>
<P>
   1997 record 11-5, lost in first round of playoffs
</P>
<P>
   STRENGTHS _ Plenty. A wonderful, agile quarterback in Mark
Brunell. A solid big back in James Stewart and a bright new one in
Fred Taylor from Florida. A dynamic receiver in Kennan McCardell
and an offensive line, led by tackle Tony Boselli, that can make it
all click. A defensive line led by end Tony Brackens that is quick
as much as it is strong. Linebacking led by newcomer Bryce Paup
from Buffalo that is efficient. And quality defensive backs.
</P>
<P>
   WEAKNESSES _ One has to look hard to find them. Maybe the
special teams bear watching. Injuries hurt this team plenty last
season and it still won 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK _ Super. As in Super Bowl?
</P>
<P>
   2. BALTIMORE
</P>
<P>
   1997 record 6-9-1
</P>
<P>
   STRENGTHS _ A new attitude. A new quarterback (Jim Harbaugh) who
is a leader and a winner. A new back in Errict Rhett who has plenty
to prove and is set on doing so. A trio of linebackers _ Ray Lewis,
Peter Boulware and Jamie Sharper _ who rank among the best in
football. The leadership of veteran cornerback Rod Woodson.
</P>
<P>
   WEAKNESSES _ Wilting in close games. The Ravens were 3-5-1 in
games decided by 3 or fewer points.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK _ A surprise team. Playoff potential.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   3. PITTSBURGH
</P>
<P>
   1997 record 11-5, lost in second round of playoffs
</P>
<P>
   STRENGTHS _ Experience. Success. Six consecutive playoff
appearances. Levon Kirkland and Jason Gildon at linebackers,
wonderful players in their prime, with even more talent beside and
behind them. The consummate defensive back and leader in Carnell
Lake. A bulldozing running back in Jerome Bettis. The most elusive
quarterback in the league in Kordell Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   WEAKNESSES _ No Yancey Thigpen at receiver and yet another year
for Pittsburgh to compensate for a huge free agency loss. Their are
several capable answers but presently they are questions.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK _ Is this the season the rest of this division finally
begins catching up with the Steelers? Yes.
</P>
<P>
   4. TENNESSEE
</P>
<P>
   1997 record 8-8
</P>
<P>
   STRENGTHS _ They have a young, vibrant team and a three-pronged
offense (quarterback Steve McNair, running back Eddie George and
receiver Yancey Thigpen) that will cause defenses fits. A rookie
receiver in Kevin Dyson from Utah who is a strong rookie of the
year candidate.
</P>
<P>
   WEAKNESSES _ The defensive front is young and inexperienced. The
linebackers are not dominating.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK _ The Oilers look like a team that will score a lot and
give up a lot. If the defense rises, so does this team.
</P>
<P>
   5. CINCINNATI: 7-9
</P>
<P>
   STRENGTHS _ Corey Dillon. He is an exciting tailback who has
only begun to maximize his abilities. Neil O'Donnell at quarterback
is a safe choice. As rocky as the Bengals have been, he will
provide stability if not spectacular play. Dick LeBeau as defensive
coordinator: a natural strength because he is one of pro football's
finest defensive minds.
</P>
<P>
   WEAKNESSES _ With Dan Wilkinson gone off the line, who provides
teeth on the defensive front?
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK _ This team led the NFL in rushing touchdowns last
season with 23. In another division, it could fight for the top.
Even now, it is not as far away as it may appear.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WESTERN DIVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   1. DENVER
</P>
<P>
   1997 record 12-4, Super Bowl champions
</P>
<P>
   STRENGTHS _ Terrell Davis is the player who makes the Broncos
special and John Elway is the player who makes the franchise click.
Denver won the Super Bowl with these two at the top but with plenty
of help on both sides of the ball and from the sideline. It was the
essence of teams and big plays and players rising to new levels to
achieve greatness. If only it could be bottled.
</P>
<P>
   WEAKNESSES _ The offensive line, particularly the right side, is
a concern. Especially with guard Brian Habib gone, who left for
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK _ Rosy. The Broncos have terrific leadership in head
coach Mike Shanahan. From top to bottom, he is as good as it gets.
</P>
<P>
   2. KANSAS CITY
</P>
<P>
   1997 record 13-3 lost in second round of playoffs).
</P>
<P>
   STRENGTHS _ A robust defense. The talent and desire of
linebacker Derrick Thomas. Good chemistry and consistency: this
team has finished first or second in this division in each of the
past nine years.
</P>
<P>
   WEAKNESSES _ Is the running game going to work? The Chiefs did
it by committee last season and did not have a 1,000 yard rusher.
Kimble Anders at fullback is a wonderful player. But at tailback
this team is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK _ Strong. Super Bowl caliber.
</P>
<P>
   3. SEATTLE
</P>
<P>
   1997 record 8-8
</P>
<P>
   STRENGTHS _ Warren Moon. He is 42 this season and still provides
a wonderful arm, nimble feet, strong decision making and leadership
at quarterback. His receivers are stellar: Joey Galloway, Brian
Blades and Mike Pritchard. Toss in James McNight _ he led the
league in yards per catch last year at 18.7. Ricky Watters is the
new tailback and he gives the Seahawks a path to success. Kevin
Glover, a Pro Bowl center in from Detroit, is a nifty addition. The
defensive line with Cortez Kennedy and Michael Sinclair is stout.
Linebacker Chad Brown (former Steeler) should settle in nicely in
his second season in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   WEAKNESSES _ Special teams. They were lousy last season.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK _ This team has a great upside. It could soar. It could
fall flat. The Seahawks have the ability to take anything they
want.
</P>
<P>
   4. OAKLAND
</P>
<P>
   1997 record 4-12
</P>
<P>
   STRENGTHS _ Charles Woodson. Though just a rookie, he is the
kind of player who elevates teammates' play. The Raiders' defense
certainly needs that. Defensive tackle Darrell Russell is the
catalyst the Raiders would like to build around. Jeff George at
quarterback can wing it and Napoleon Kaufman at tailback can run
it. Tim Brown can catch it.
</P>
<P>
   WEAKNESSES _ Can the Raiders defend it? They ranked dead last
last season in overall defense, rushing defense and in passing
defense.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK _ New coach Jon Gruden has work to do. The Raiders are
so tangled that it will take time to straighten them out.
</P>
<P>
   5. SAN DIEGO
</P>
<P>
   1997 record 4-12
</P>
<P>
   STRENGTHS _ New hope in franchise quarterback Ryan Leaf. The
return of big back Natrone Means. Receiver Tony Martin. Linebacker
Junior Seau. Kicker John Carney.
</P>
<P>
   WEAKNESSES _ Allowed the most points in the league last season
(425). Gained fewest sacks (27). Lost their last eight consecutive
games. Was penalized for the most yards (1,101). Lots of problems.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK _ Leaf will have to play way over his head to turn this
team around in one season. The defense will have play out of its
mind to accomplish the same. Maybe later. Not now.

OLD FACES IN NEW PLACES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   George Seifert was contemplating his career change, from
coaching to neophyte studio analyst on CBS' revived ``The NFL
Today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you say, `God, what did I get myself into?'''
Seifert, the former 49ers coach, said last week. ``I find myself
getting nervous and needing a walk.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Football League season that begins this afternoon
will be a test for Seifert, but more importantly, for CBS. Having
committed $500 million a year through 2005 for American Football
Conference rights that were NBC's, CBS will be the focus of intense
scrutiny as it returns from a four-season hiatus.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics will await news contrary to CBS' guarantee that it will
``make a dollar'' on its $4 billion contract. NBC, which declined
to renew the AFC rights and mocked the CBS deal, will leap eagerly
on word of the first losses.
</P>
<P>
   On-screen changes begin with game times. Late Sunday afternoon
games on CBS and Fox will begin at 4:15 p.m. Eastern Time to
accommodate late-ending early games. ABC's ``Monday Night
Football'' will begin at 8 p.m. with a 20-minute pre-game show, the
first in its 29-year history.
</P>
<P>
   CBS _ In the studio, Seifert will join Marcus Allen, the former
Chiefs running back, Brent Jones, the former 49ers tight end, and
the host, Jim Nantz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize we're an expansion team,'' Nantz said. ``We won't be
perfect right away. It's going to be a slow process. In December,
we'll look back and see significant improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   A totally untested analyst threesome is risky, especially when
studio shows let networks truly differentiate themselves. CBS
should have hired Cris Collinsworth, but when he came calling, he
got no clear sense of CBS' plans.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, to CBS, the combination of two newly retired players and a
coach who is one year from sideline work was irresistible. ``We'll
be as fresh and contemporary as anyone,'' said Sean McManus, the
president of CBS Sports. The key, as always, will be the quality of
information from the group.
</P>
<P>
   For games, CBS imported its No. 1 team, Greg Gumbel and Phil
Simms from NBC. Randy Cross, Sam Wyche, Don Criqui and Beasley
Reece also came from NBC; Verne Lundquist and Mark May came from
TNT, Kevin Harlan from Fox and Ian Eagle from Jets broadcasts on
New York's WFAN. CBS erred in not hiring Charlie Jones, who will
not call football for the first time since 1960.
</P>
<P>
   ABC _ While ``Monday Night Football'' rights stayed put (they
cost more, at $550 million a year), there is a new start time, and
the pre-game show from the ESPN Zone sports bar in Baltimore, with
two hosts _ ESPN's Chris Berman and Frank Gifford, who shifts to
the studio after 27 years in the ``M.N.F.'' booth.
</P>
<P>
   Brian McAndrews, general manager of ABC Sports, said: ``It will
not be in-depth X's and O's. It's meant as a prime-time
entertainment launching pad.''
</P>
<P>
   On games, Al Michaels and Dan Dierdorf will return, but
Gifford's successor is Boomer Esiason, the former Jets and
Cincinnati Bengals quarterback. ``My biggest problem,'' Esiason
said after three preseason games, ``is knowing so much about the
game and compacting my thoughts into small sound bites. I know
there've been times when I'm a little wordy. It's a work in
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   ESPN _ With its $600 million-a-year deal, ESPN took home to
Bristol, Conn., the entire Sunday night cable package. No more
taking over the Sunday night schedule in midseason after TNT
finished its half-season of games.
</P>
<P>
   To its Sunday morning ``NFL Countdown'' show, ESPN added 30
minutes (to two hours), Mike Tirico as Berman's co-host and Jim
Kelly as an analyst. Paul Maguire is ESPN's third game announcer,
with Mike Patrick and Joe Theismann.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess people will say, `Gee, Joe will talk less,'''
Theismann said. ``But Paul offers so much, you can just sit back
and listen.''
</P>
<P>
   NFL cross-promotion between ABC and ESPN will run rampant,
reminding everyone from here to Alpha Centauri of the Sunday
night-Monday night football link. Hank Williams Jr.'s ``Are you
ready for some football?'' song, which has long opened ABC's
telecast, will also open ESPN's.
</P>
<P>
   Fox _ The network that roiled the business in 1993 with the
blockbuster deal that ousted CBS from the NFL made the fewest
changes. Collinsworth will spar with Howie Long and Terry Bradshaw
while James Brown keeps refereeing. Collinsworth will not shrink
from verbal conflict like his predecessor, Ronnie Lott, who was
shifted to game analysis beside Tim Ryan, Fox's other key hire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cris is opinionated, witty, and quick,'' Bradshaw said. ``I
may have to forget what I want to say to pull him in. If you let it
go _ let Howie do what he does and Cris do what he does, and I
follow suit _ it could be a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Long said adding Collinsworth stokes him competitively. ``It's
going to be like when I was playing,'' he said, ``and they drafted
another defensive end.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Collinsworth: ``Face it, to say something interesting, you
have to go out on a limb and walk the edge. No matter what side of
the branch I'm on, someone will try to knock me off. And that's
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   And what of James Brown's role? ``Being left out is a perception
because they're so strong, but my role is no less significant,''
Brown said. ``When they talk esoterica, I can't let them lose sight
of the big picture.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC/TNT _ Out of the NFL picture, they are planning a summer pro
football league starting next year.

   The New York Times News Service calls your attention to a
special report, End of a Ghetto, on efforts to raze some of the
nation's worst public housing projects and integrate their
residents into mainstream communities.
</P>
<P>
   The story will move in two forms: full length as published in
The New York Times and in an abridged version of 1,900 words. They
will move Saturday morning in the ``a'' news file and are for
publication beginning Sunday, Sept. 6 and thereafter.

</P>
<P>
   PUBLIC-HOUSING-REFORM (Chicago) _ From Hartford, Conn., and
Newark, N.J., to Denver and San Francisco, the federal government
is working with cities to clear the very slums it helped create:
public housing projects crippled by flawed policies and
mismanagement and overwhelmed by poverty and crime. Hundreds of
thousands of tenants will move to smaller developments that mix
families of different incomes or into privately owned buildings.
</P>
<P>
   But success will require communities to accept as neighbors
people they have long been happy to have out of sight. And one of
the toughest questions facing housing officials is how to deal with
intensely troubled families, whose problems could cripple their
adjustment to a new home or harm their new neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is the challenge greater than at Chicago's Robert Taylor
Homes, the nation's largest housing project, much of which is
``considered the worst slum area in the United States'' according
to its landlord, the Chicago Housing Authority.

   (NYT1) CHICAGO _ PUBLIC-HOUSING-REFORM-1 _ Henry Sistrunk, 27,

Chicago's notorious Robert Taylor Homes housing project. On the
back of Sistrunk's left shoulder is a tattoo of The Hole's three
high-rise buildings, done by his brother. (Ozier Muhammad/New York

   (NYT2) CHICAGO _ PUBLIC-HOUSING-REFORM-2 _ A student at Mary B.
Terrell Elementary School, a public school near the Robert Taylor
Homes, walks through The Hole. Much of Robert Taylor, the nation's
largest housing project that is ``considered the worst slum area in
the United States,'' according to its landlord, the Chicago Housing
Authority, is being demolished. (Ozier Muhammad/New York Times

Chicago. At this ``scattered site'' apartment her landlord will
remain the federal government. (Ozier Muhammad/New York Times

<P>
   (NYT4) CHICAGO _ PUBLIC-HOUSING-REFORM-4 _ Angela Smith, 25, was
in a frenzy to pack her belongings before the movers came to put
her things into storage. Like most people who lived in The Hole,
she didn't want another housing authority apartment: she wanted a
federal rent subsidy known as a Section 8 certificate, which will
allow her to rent her own apartment. (Ozier Muhammad/New York Times

   (NYT5) ROSELAND, Ill. _ PUBLIC-HOUSING-REFORM-5 _ Billy Kimmons,
23, looks over his neighborhood from the porch of his new apartment

forced to move out of The Hole, the most oppressive section of
Chicago's notorious Robert Taylor Homes housing project. (Ozier

his daughter, Mary Bee Christian, in Jones' temporary apartment in
the Robert Taylor Homes housing project. Jones and his daughter
presented one of the toughest relocation situations for families in
The Hole. As a result, they were among the last people to leave
their building, and then they moved only to temporary housing with
about 25 other intensely troubled families. (Ozier Muhammad/New

   RISK-TAKERS-REVIEW _ Risk was a great thing when new worlds and
new frontiers beckoned and the risk-takers had little to lose. Now
millions of people crowd the coasts, living in more expensive
properties built more shoddily than a generation ago, and more
vulnerable to oceans and storms and quakes. Beyond the nation's
borders, in the world's financial markets, people are also living
nearer to the edge, in riskier ways, closer to the winds of rising
storms. As prosperity has grown, risk has grown with it. By Tim
Weiner. &QL;

   LITTLE-LEAGUE-REVIEW _ Roughly 80 percent of today's major
leaguers played Little League baseball _ including players from
places outside the United States, like Panama (Mariano Rivera of
the Yankees) and even tiny Curacao (Andruw Jones of the Atlanta
Braves). Eight played in the Little League World Series. By Alan

   RUSSIA-ECON-REVIEW _ Life in Russia is hard _ harder still,
because so many expected better this time. But this is the nation
that coped with the Golden Horde, Ivan the Terrible, the siege of
Leningrad and communism, and outlived them all. Coping is in the
national genetic code, a source of humor and pride and even song:
``Anything but the war,'' goes a refrain from a popular Soviet-era
tune. In a nation where workers go months without pay, basic
services are spotty and the currency is losing its worth, it may be
Boris Yeltsin's salvation, too. By Michael Wines. &QL;

   DEMS-CLINTON-REVIEW _ Ever since the Lewinsky scandal broke in
January, Washington pundits have been saying that the time might
come when Democratic elders went down to the White House to tell
Clinton that, for the party's sake, he should begin to pack. One
difficulty with this vision is that there is only a handful of
Democrats on whom the president relies, and from whom he might take
such a message seriously. By Adam Clymer. &QL;

<P>
   BABY-LITERACY-REVIEW _ For baby's literary enlightenment, the
hand that rocks the cradle should also be turning the the pages of
``Good Night Moon'' or ``The Poky Little Puppy.'' At least that's
the hope of an assortment of major publishers seeking to raise a
new generation of book buyers. It's also the goal of a growing
number of charities and foundations that have brought together
pediatricians, volunteers and librarians in a less commercial quest
to promote the notion that reading aloud to toddlers, babies _ even
newborns _ is a child-care ritual as vital as mother's milk. By
Doreen Carvajal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX-RUMORS-REVIEW _ Everybody here is whispering about everybody
else's sex life. No one, of course, is recommending such talk.
Heaven forbid. No one wants the president's troubles to unleash a
squinty-eyed inquisition into the sexual mores of a publicly dull,
prudish city with a history of smeared lipstick behind closed
office doors. But in the White House, on Capitol Hill and in
political consultancies and law firms, people say it will happen.

   AMERICANS-MOOD-REVIEW _ Americans are far from depressed. News
about falling currencies, market fluctuations and sexual

future, the reigning sentiment out there now is one of relative
satisfaction. By Jennifer Steinhauer. &QL;

   Reno Opens the Door To Campaign Inquiries
</P>
<P>
   For two years, Attorney General Janet Reno resisted calls that
she seek independent investigations of allegations that Democrats
violated election funding laws in the 1996 campaign. Now she has
opened the door.
</P>
<P>
   First she ordered an investigation into whether Harold M. Ickes,
the former deputy White House chief of staff, committed perjury
last year when he told a Senate committee examining Democratic
campaign funding practices that he knew nothing about White House
efforts to intervene in a labor dispute on behalf of the teamsters'
union. At the time, Democrats were seeking the union's campaign
support. Ickes' lawyers said he told the truth, but the Senate
panel said it had uncovered evidence that Ickes sought to aid the
union.
</P>
<P>
   Reno also reopened a Justice Department inquiry into whether an
independent prosecutor should be named to examine spending by the
1996 Clinton-Gore campaign. She cited a Federal Election Commission
audit that questions the legality of an advertising campaign
underwritten by the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese Stranded by Floods
</P>
<P>
   China has declared at least a temporary victory against its
swollen rivers, but its authorities are facing a problem more
daunting than this year's record-breaking floods: millions of
refugees whose homes and belongings were literally washed away.
They are a sad lot, now camping out in tents, schools, factories or
at relatives' homes until they can began rebuilding their lives. It
may not be soon.
</P>
<P>
   Although the record river levels have now started to recede,
many towns will remain submerged for a month or more. In the south,
this means thousands could be stuck living on dikes, drinking
contaminated Yangtze River water. In the frigid northeast, where
night temperatures are approaching freezing, many of the more than
2 million flood refugees will not have a chance to rebuild their
mud-brick homes before winter comes. The provincial government has
said that ``home'' this winter for hundreds of thousands of
displaced people will be government-provided tents.

   A Summit Trip Like No Other
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton met with President Boris Yeltsin in
Moscow, the near collapse of Russia's economy was on his mind, but
there wasn't much to be done beyond expressions of support if
Russia stayed the course of reform.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians and Americans also concluded an agreement that
would let U.S. satellites give Russia dependable warnings about
missile launchings around the world. The satellites were originally
put up to safeguard America against Russian missile launchings. But
now there is another danger: errors could be made by the
deteriorating Russian early-warning system, leading to an
accidental nuclear war. Thus the American backup.
</P>
<P>
   After Russia, Clinton proceeded to Northern Ireland, where he
was greeted as a peacemaker, and the Irish Republic, where he
praised the country's prosperity as a fruit of peace. He also
resumed facing reporters' questions about his relationship with the
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians Execute 2
</P>
<P>
   The first executions by the Palestinian Authority were hardly a
paragon of justice. Only three days passed from the time members of
the Abu Sultan family killed two brothers from the al-Khalidi clan
to the time two Abu Sultan brothers were executed by firing squads
in the Gaza police headquarters _ just time enough for some
threatening protests in the streets, a quickie military trial and
an OK from Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the executions had virtually unanimous support in the Gaza
Strip. One reason was that ancient tribal codes of justice still
predominate in Gazan society, and if the Palestinian Authority had
not executed the Abu Sultans, the large and powerful al-Khalidi
clan would have had to do so itself.
</P>
<P>
   But the most significant reason was that the killings brought
out a rising anger among Palestinians about the misuse of firearms
and power by members of Arafat's many security forces (There are at
least 12 such forces).
</P>
<P>
   The condemned Abu Sultan brothers were both members of the
security forces, and they had used their service weapons to gun
down the al-Khalidi brothers in a dispute.

   Airline Stalls State
</P>
<P>
   While the Northwest Airlines pilots strike might have
inconvenienced much of the country, most people probably made do
with another airline or a delay. Not in North Dakota. There people
were forced to do without the state's only major airline.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest city, Fargo, was reduced to three 30-seat United
Express commuter flights a day. The state capital, Bismarck,
hobbled by with six 19-seat turboprop flights. And people in the
third and fourth largest cities in the state, Grand Forks and
Minot, could not fly in or out at all.
</P>
<P>
   And then came a second double blow. No more driving north and
flying out of Winnipeg. Air Canada went on strike, too.

   Prosecutors Drop Murder Case Against 2 Children
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, prosecutors in Chicago accused two boys, 7 and 8
years old, of having murdered an 11-year-old girl riding her
bicycle in their neighborhood. The girl's body was found with
evidence of having been sexually molested, and the police said the
boys had confessed to attacking her.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, the prosecutors dropped the murder case against the
boys after a crime laboratory report issued to prosecutors showed
the presence of semen in the girl's underpants; police crime
experts said it was highly unlikely that boys so young could
produce semen.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the police said the boys had initially reported
seeing a strange man lure the girl, Ryan Harris, into a car, but
had changed their story under questioning. Defense lawyers
contended all along that the questioning _ which produced the
incriminating admissions on which the police based their case _ had
been improper.
</P>
<P>
   Optimism, For Once, in Ulster  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Confidence in a more secure future has unexpectedly come to
Northern Ireland scarcely three weeks after the most deadly episode
in the conflicted province's bloody history.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 15, former members of the Irish Republican Army unhappy
with the organization's 14-month old cease fire and its apparent
tactical shift in favor of a negotiated settlement bombed the town
center of Omagh, killing 28 people and wounding more than 200
others. Public revulsion at the bombing converted the act, designed
to sink the peace agreement signed last April, into one that gave
the accord new buoyancy.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's
political ally, condemned the Omagh bombing. He said violence in
Northern Ireland was ``a thing of the past, over, done with and
gone,'' and committed his party to the effort to plan the gradual
disarmament of paramilitary groups. The statements from Adams were
carefully crafted to meet demands that the IRA declare its war over
and signal its willingness to talk about dismantling its arsenal of
weapons and explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Protestant opponents welcomed the moves and hinted strongly that
they were prepared to end their snubbing of Sinn Fein and to clear
the way for party members to enter fully into the leadership of the
new Northern Ireland Assembly and other political institutions set
up by the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   On hand to witness this hopeful moment was President Clinton,
hailed by the British Prime Minister Tony Blair as an invaluable
participant in the forging of the peace settlement. Clinton's
troubles in Washington went unmentioned as adoring crowds cheered
him on his one-day visit to Northern Ireland. He told them the
peace they had constructed should now become the model for warring
communities in other ethnic conflicts around the world.

   After All, Dear, It's Only Money  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When New York Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross first announced that
she would run for governor, Democrats took notice. She had just
joined the Democratic Party, and she was still a relative newcomer
to the business of politics, but she came with the promise of money
_ courtesy of her husband, investment banker Wilbur Ross.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCaughey Ross pledged that her husband would bankroll a
lush campaign, complete with the television advertisements she
would surely need to appeal to Democratic primary voters who might
be wary about supporting someone who had been elected as the
running mate of the Republican George Pataki in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But now all that has collapsed, in an episode that underscores
the lesson that the strongest campaigns are not necessarily those
blessed by the richest benefactors.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Ross withdrew $2.25 million of the money he had
given her. That left the candidate struggling to find a way to stay
afloat in the final days of her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCaughey Ross said her husband had acted ``for reasons
unrelated to this campaign, for personal and financial reasons,''
and remained chipper on Friday, asserting that nothing had changed
_ except, of course, for money.

<P>
   CHICAGO _ In the final months of The Hole, anarchy was
everywhere. The Hole, the most oppressive section of Chicago's
notorious Robert Taylor Homes housing project, was coming down.
</P>
<P>
   Gang members shot at a moving van outside one of The Hole's
three high-rise buildings. Moving crews tried to hurry out each day
before drug dealers commandeered the elevators.
</P>
<P>
   Lenzie Jones packed his grandchildren's clothes for the movers
but did not know what to do with their mother's belongings. She had
fled a few days before, after the drug gang she hawked heroin for
accused her of stealing and beat her with a baseball bat and a
two-by-four.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Smith frantically swatted cockroaches and attacked stains
in her kitchen. An inspector from the building she wanted to move
into was coming to scrutinize her housekeeping. If she failed, she
would lose the new apartment she had set her heart on.
</P>
<P>
   Katie Sistrunk, who at 45 had reared 13 children in the Hole,
had no idea where she would go, days before her building was to be
emptied. Juanita Williams, 74, was so paralyzed over leaving her
apartment of 25 years that she stayed after the water and gas were
shut off, until police officers removed her.
</P>
<P>
   On a scale not seen in decades, the federal government is
helping cities clear slums again, but this time they are slums it
helped create: public housing projects crippled by flawed policies
and mismanagement and overwhelmed by poverty and crime.
</P>
<P>
   From Hartford and Newark to Denver and San Francisco, 100,000
apartments in the nation's worst public housing projects are being
razed under a federal program called Hope VI. The plan is to
replace them with smaller developments that mix families of
different incomes, while moving thousands of tenants into privately
owned buildings.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, where high-rise housing projects are corrosive
landmarks of poverty and racial segregation, the demolition will be
nothing less than seismic: the city wants to raze 11,000
apartments, nearly 40 percent of its public housing for families,
over the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   And in a city whose housing projects contain 11 of the nation's
15 poorest census tracts, and where buildings in five large
projects are being demolished in whole or in part, nowhere is the
challenge greater than at Robert Taylor, the nation's largest
housing project, much of which is ``considered the worst slum area
in the United States'' according to its landlord, the Chicago
Housing Authority. The Hole, at the project's southern end, was the
first section to go, demolished in July. But the housing authority
wants to tear down all of the project's 28 high-rises, all 4,321
apartments.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge is not just for the 11,000 people who will leave
Robert Taylor, a population 99 percent black, so poor that nearly
half of the adults live on less than $5,000 a year, and so isolated
that many are unfamiliar with life beyond the grim monoliths that
shadow the Dan Ryan Expressway on the South Side for nearly two
miles.
</P>
<P>
   It is a test for Chicago itself, as housing officials try to
eliminate a ghetto by placing most of Robert Taylor's tenants in
private apartments. The goal is to disperse the project's
concentrated poverty without introducing or aggravating social
problems in the tenants' new neighborhoods. Success will require
communities to accept as neighbors people they have long been happy
to have out of sight. But already a pattern is emerging of tenants
from Chicago's housing projects being moved mainly to poor black
neighborhoods, many as rundown and unsafe as the high-rises they
left.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-six percent of Robert Taylor adult residents are
unemployed and little may change if they are simply moved. So a
second goal of Hope VI is to ease tenants off government
dependence. In Robert Taylor, the housing authority is spending
$1.5 million of its initial $25 million Hope VI grant on social
services, trying to place as many residents as possible in high
school equivalency courses, training programs and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Some tenants need more basic help: clothes to wear to interviews
with prospective landlords, assistance arranging electric and gas
services, classes on such housekeeping skills as cleaning carpets
and operating garbage disposals.
</P>
<P>
   The distance between Robert Taylor and the outside world is not
lost on the tenants. ``Goddamn public aid penitentiary,'' Esther
Jones, 41, said in June as she left the project after 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Other complications in relocating residents reflect the extreme
conditions at Robert Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Residents who needed temporary housing could not move for weeks
because they were identified with the Mickey Cobras, the gang that
controlled The Hole, while the apartments available were in a
Robert Taylor building controlled by a rival gang, the Black
Gangster Disciples.
</P>
<P>
   Some tenants had criminal records, drug problems or erratic
rent-paying habits that had been tolerated at Robert Taylor but
could disqualify them for new housing.
</P>
<P>
   Citywide, housing officials are trying to help tenants get the
support they need, without stigmatizing them. They are also trying
not to arouse community opposition to the newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really need a not-in-my-backyard backlash right now.''
said Wanda White, the housing authority official supervising the
relocation.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-to-Place Tenants Face a Difficult Move to Private Sector
</P>
<P>
   Angela Smith, 23, hauled out of her apartment anything broken or
filthy: ice cube trays, baby shoes, a radio. She asked friends who
were smoking marijuana to leave. The housekeeping inspector was
coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got nowhere for people to sit,'' she fretted. She threw out
her cockroach-infested couch and chairs a year ago. She and her
children shared one bed and sat on milk crates and the hood of a
large hair dryer. But roaches persisted. They crawled over her
newborn son.
</P>
<P>
   Like most people in The Hole, Ms. Smith was desperate to leave,
but not for another housing authority apartment. Virtually all of
The Hole's residents wanted federal rent subsidies known as Section
8 certificates, which would allow them to rent their own
apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, Hope VI wants Section 8 subsidies and the private
market to replace 60 percent of the destroyed units, though some
advocates for the poor worry that will worsen already severe
shortages of housing. New York, for instance, has largely ignored
Hope VI because demand for its public housing is so high.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Robert Taylor is unusual because no new public housing will be
built on the cleared site. Instead, smaller mixed-income
developments and an industrial area are planned. There are plans to
construct some public housing units nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The demand for Section 8 housing makes relocating tenants
harder. The housing authority's success in finding enough landlords
willing to accept them in enough communities to avoid
reconcentrating them has been limited since it began moving tenants
from other housing projects in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   According to an analysis by The Chicago Reporter, a monthly
magazine that focuses on racial issues, the great majority of
Section 8 placements have been in poor black neighborhoods on the
South and West Sides.
</P>
<P>
   Already some Robert Taylor tenants have had to move twice
because of disputes with landlords or perilous conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Aldermen have begun calling to say that their constituents are
concerned about Section 8 tenants moving in, Ms. White said.
</P>
<P>
   To find apartments for The Hole's tenants, the housing authority
contracted with a private relocation agency in February. The
agency's job included taking tenants to see apartments and helping
with things like applications, credit checks and arranging
utilities.
</P>
<P>
   But tenants must satisfy landlords' expectations for cleanliness
and conduct, and the housing authority expected the agency to be a
hand holder: coaching tenants on how to dress for interviews with
landlords or making sure they were prepared for housekeeping
inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. White said that after several months she replaced the agency
because it showed homes in too few neighborhoods and did not give
tenants enough help.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's president, Pam Gecan, said her staff had expected
the authority to provide that help for difficult tenants. She said
gunfire in The Hole sometimes made her workers afraid to visit
clients. The tenants, she said, tended to request certain
neighborhoods, because they were familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Kimmons, for example, a 23-year-old former gang member who
now works as a school patrol officer, was rejected by several
landlords and finally moved near a church he attended in a poor
minority neighborhood on the far South Side. Ms. Smith chose
Woodlawn, a struggling neighborhood near Robert Taylor, because her
grandmother had lived there.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith was a typical Robert Taylor tenant, a young single
mother. She said she left her mother's home at 17 because of
problems with her stepfather, and had been living on her own at
Robert Taylor since. She has three children, Nathaniel, 5; Keosha,
3; and Shamari, 4 months. Her younger sister, Aderonke Akanni, who
said she left home at 13 after her stepfather abused her, also
lived with her.
</P>
<P>
   Life in The Hole was chaotic. Ms. Smith said the father of her
children beat her. She struggled on welfare, falling behind on her
$44 monthly rent. She did not permit her children to play outside
the apartment because gang violence made even hallways dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's scary,'' she said. ``They shoot just to shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the turbulence, Ms. Smith and her sister were driven to
improve their lives. Ms. Smith, petite and spirited, is studying
for a high school equivalency diploma and plans to study nursing.
Ms. Akanni, 18, works at a Lady Footlocker store and takes classes
toward her equivalency diploma.
</P>
<P>
   Applying for a Section 8 apartment, Ms. Smith was organized and
efficient. She quickly assembled birth certificates, Social
Security cards and her son's report card to prove he attended
school.
</P>
<P>
   But the housekeeping inspector for her new landlord was
unimpressed. Ms. Smith said he complained about writing on the
walls, lack of furniture and her friends _ who had moved their
marijuana smoking to the hallway. Just weeks before her building
was to be emptied, she failed the inspection.
</P>
<P>
   Crestfallen and angry, she had to search for an apartment again,
while living with her mother. Finally, in July, she was approved
for an apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weren't nobody smoking weed in my house,'' she said about
failing the inspection. ``And nobody going to be fixing up this
raggedy place when you're fixing to move. They know this is the
projects, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Decline and Fall _ Public Housing Becomes Hell Hole
</P>
<P>
   The Robert Taylor Homes, named for Chicago's first black housing
authority chairman, was among the last housing projects built in
the city. Begun in 1959, it completed a four-mile corridor of
public housing along State Street. While its new high-rises were
welcome replacements for a shantytown, they quickly became the
nation's largest government-sponsored ghetto.
</P>
<P>
   Housing projects in Chicago are starkly identified with race and
poverty. From the beginning, city officials used them, along with
the expressways being built at the same time, to contain the city's
growing population of poor blacks. Of Chicago's 67,000 public
housing families, 97 percent are black.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, six years after completion of the last buildings, the
three that became known as The Hole, Congress changed the public
housing rent policy with disastrous results for projects across the
country. Instead of a fixed rent, tenants were to pay a percentage
of their income.
</P>
<P>
   At Robert Taylor, working families moved out as their rent rose
while neighbors on welfare paid almost nothing. Housing officials,
wary of discrimination suits, stopped screening tenants. Single
mothers as young as 16 were given apartments.
</P>
<P>
   As the project filled with impoverished people, rent income fell
and maintenance had to be cut. Tenants threw things off the
exterior gangways that linked apartments, so they were covered with
steel grating, like a prison. Leaks and broken windows went
unfixed. Elevators and hallways reeked of urine.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago's projects, ``everything that could have gone wrong
went wrong,'' said Joseph Shuldiner, the executive director of the
housing authority, who was brought in to fix an agency so inept the
federal government took it over in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get a population that is beginning to create
problems, then you have trouble attracting people,'' he said. ``The
managers said, `They're not letting me screen _ the heck with it.'
Then your maintenance stinks. It just becomes a steamroller
effect.''
</P>
<P>
   In a housing project that was home to 20,000 residents at its
peak, but few men, gangs got an early hold. Violence and drugs
devastated generations. As families moved out, vacant apartments
became havens for drug dealers. Gangs ripped out metal detectors
installed at entranceways and cut the wires of intercoms intended
to screen visitors.

<P>
   In The Hole, clusters of drug dealers brazenly hawked heroin and
cocaine, forming gantlets in the entranceways. The wind whipped
crack vials like shrapnel.
</P>
<P>
   Police were frustrated by gang lookouts and the ability of
dealers to vanish into high-rise hideouts. Dealers became so cocky
that recently a gang member waved a roll of money at a group of
housing officials and offered to buy The Hole for $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that's why they call it The Hole,'' said Deborah
Mardis, a resident for 20 years. ``You fall in and you never get
out.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mardis managed to leave in 1994, but her son Dequan, a gang
member, kept returning. In January, visiting a girlfriend at a
rival gang's building, he was shot six times. He survived.
</P>
<P>
   After another shooting the next day, parents kept children home
from the elementry school across a parking lot from the Hole, then
formed patrols to escort them to class.
</P>
<P>
   In February, a man was killed crossing from The Hole to Disciple
territory. In March, postal workers did not deliver mail for a day
because of shooting. One April weekend, a man was killed and
another wounded. In June, a 9-year-old was shot. In August, a
police officer investigating drug dealing was critically wounded. A
16-year-old and two 17-year-olds were charged.
</P>
<P>
   ``A long time ago, I decided that to survive here, you had to be
crazy, chemically saturated, Christian, or some kind of
character,'' said a woman called Cat Lady, a squatter in The Hole
who rescued cats trapped in vacant apartments. ``If we could gather
the children, I'd do that.''

<P>
   Troubled Families with Stubborn Problems Hinder Relocation
</P>
<P>
   Mary Bee Christian handed her sons vanilla ice cream cones she
had bought from an ice cream truck and made a beeline for the
bedroom with what she had bought for herself: $5 worth of crack and
$20 of heroin. Using a lottery ticket to scoop the heroin and a
tube from a light fixture as a crack pipe, Ms. Christian snorted
and smoked her speedball.
</P>
<P>
   When Willie, 7, shouted that the boys had finished eating, Ms.
Christian replied, ``Then watch some cartoons.'' When her lighter
ran out of fluid, she told Willie and his brother, Jhonell, 6, to
go to their room, so they would not see her light her crack pipe at
the kitchen stove.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Lenzie Jones, at 61 stooped and leather-faced,
watched helplessly. ``Oh Mary,'' he said, ``Do you have to do that
now?''
</P>
<P>
   One of the toughest questions facing housing officials is how to
deal with intensely troubled families. Not only could their
problems cripple their adjustment to a new home, but they could
harm their new neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to make it better for the people you are
relocating,'' Ms. White, the housing authority official, said,
``but you also have to make it better for the people who will be
their neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Taylor has two devoted and savvy relocation specialists
to work with families. In early 1997, they began untangling
complications for the nearly 300 families in The Hole. Now they are
doing the same in the next two buildings scheduled to come down.
</P>
<P>
   Making repeated visits, sometimes working nights and weekends,
they sort out who is on each lease _ and therefore entitled to new
housing _ tell tenants of problems such as unpaid rent, and explain
their options: Section 8 subsidies, another housing project, or
``scattered site'' apartments, which are managed by the authority
but are not in a project. They also arrange moves, pay security
deposits and visit families in their new homes.
</P>
<P>
   But the authority's relocation workers face many of the same
problems as the private relocation agencies. Tenants miss
appointments, waffle on their housing choice, misunderstand
instructions. Because few have telephones, it is difficult even to
check on them.
</P>
<P>
   Once families move, visiting them can take two months because of
the staff's workload.
</P>
<P>
   When the relocation specialists encounter problems like drug
abuse and child neglect, they can only refer families to the
housing authority's social services department, which arranges for
help from government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Responses are slow, said Ms. White, who is introducing
improvements designed to ensure that each family's problems are
monitored closely.
</P>
<P>
   Another challenge is determining whether some families are so
troubled that they should be turned out of public housing entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Under a federal court order in the 1970s and 1980s, Chicago
moved 7,100 families out of segregated public housing and into
rent-subsidized apartments. Central to the highly praised program
was intensive counseling for families that was able to screen out
troubled people.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of screening is much harder when entire buildings are
being emptied. ``That was a huge criticism, that we have people not
being compassionate and it's just the get-them-out syndrome,'' Ms.
White said. ``On the flip side, you have the fear that we're just
transferring problems.''
</P>
<P>
   In The Hole, Jones and his daughter presented one of the
toughest situations. As a result, they were among the last people
to leave their building, and then they moved only to temporary
housing with about 25 other families with difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to protect Jones and his grandchildren from his
drug-addicted daughter, housing officials separated the grandfather
and grandchildren from Ms. Christian in April. They knew that in
March, Ms. Christian's boyfriend had hit Jones with a crowbar to
make him give up the children's welfare money.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was given an apartment in another Robert Taylor building
for himself and the children. Ms. Christian was supposed to stay
away.
</P>
<P>
   Housing officials could have tried to evict Ms. Christian from
the project because of her drug use. But one of the relocation
specialists, Brenda Hunter, who grew up in Robert Taylor, said she
knew Ms. Christian would then impose on her father, so instead she
was given an apartment of her own _ rent-free, because she had no
legal income.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Christian's new apartment was in the same building as
her father's, and she began staying with her father and children,
planning to rent or lend her apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many other tenants, Jones wanted a private apartment, so
Ms. Hunter and her partner, Sonya Franklin, arranged an interview
with CHAC Inc., the agency hired by the housing authority to see
that tenants qualify financially for rent subsidies. On a late
April day, he dressed up in a white hat with a yellow feather _
picked up at a church giveaway _ but the interview did not go well.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Because the apartment in The Hole had been leased in his
daughter's name, he was told, the Section 8 program could not help
him until the housing authority put his name on the lease, too. And
because his daughter owed $250 in back rent, no one living there
could get a rent subsidy until the debt was paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the government,'' the interviewer, Patrice
Halliburton, said apologetically. ``You can't bend the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones wilted, bewildered by bureaucratic red tape. He went back
to his temporary apartment, where later that day his daughter
arrived, carrying the ice cream for her boys and the drugs for
herself.
</P>
<P>
   A well-meaning but overwhelmed man who has spent most of his
life in housing projects, working at jobs like spray painting
barrels, Jones had trouble asking for help. He had no phone. When a
gang war broke out in June, even Ms. Hunter and Ms. Franklin were
afraid to visit.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Jones fetched the police to stop Ms. Christian and
her boyfriend from stealing his furniture, clothes and the
children's food. The next day, he armed himself with a meat cleaver
when the couple tried to return.
</P>
<P>
   Having lost what she called her ``advertising job'' shouting out
to drug buyers ``Hurricane'' and ``Chaos,'' the names of heroin,
Ms. Christian turned to prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Christian blames herself for ravaging her family and
sometimes she resolves to stop using drugs. In June, she checked
into a short-term detoxification program, then came home and read
stories to her sons. At other times she said, ``All I know is to go
out there and do my hustle and get myself some wake-up so I can
function.''
</P>
<P>
   By late July, the family owed nearly $500 in rent and Jones'
welfare payments had been cut in half because he had missed an
appointment with a caseworker.
</P>
<P>
   In early August, housing officials met with each of the
temporarily relocated families, most of whom were behind on rent.
At least four were told they would be evicted, Ms. Hunter said. No
family is permanently moved until back rent is paid.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hunter said Jones told her he would try to pay his rent so
that she could begin trying to get him a Section 8 subsidy. The
rent has not been paid, but Ms. Hunter said she is not giving up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely don't want him to get left behind,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Problems and Promise: Diverse Family Poses Dilemma
</P>
<P>
   Katie Sistrunk was packing, getting ready to move any day. Then,
in January, the letter came.
</P>
<P>
   The private agency screening people for the apartment she wanted
had rejected her. The letter cited ``many problems with this
family,'' including ``gang affiliation'' and ``poor rent-paying
habits.'' It said two of her teen-agers quit school ``to pursue a
career in crime, i.e. robbing and stalking innocent people.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the letter was wrong. In part, it confused Ms. Sistrunk
with a sister arrested on drug charges. It was just the first hitch
in her effort to maneuver her large and complicated family through
the housing bureaucracy and out of the Robert Taylor Homes.
</P>
<P>
   With gravelly voice and gap-toothed smile, Ms. Sistrunk is a
passionate advocate for herself, 13 children, 28 grandchildren and
dozens more relatives. Her family is so identified with the Hole
that one son, 27-year-old Henry, has a tattoo of the three
high-rises.
</P>
<P>
   The Sistrunks illustrate the complexities of many families in
Robert Taylor. One family may have members who have succeeded
against bleak odds and members whose criminal behavior could result
in eviction under public housing rules, or could prevent them from
getting private housing.
</P>
<P>
   Over 27 years in The Hole, the Sistrunks have made undeniable
strides. They relied little on welfare, living mostly on income
from Ms. Sistrunk's former husband. In the middle of squalor, the
children ironed their jeans and T-shirts. Three children have
attended college. One, on a basketball scholarship, expects to
graduate with a degree in architecture. But five of Ms. Sistrunk's
grown children have criminal records, some involving weapons or
drugs, court documents show.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got tons of problems,'' Ms. Hunter, the relocation
specialist, said, ``but they got a lot going for them, they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hunter does not volunteer sensitive information like arrests
to prospective landlords. And she tried to get the private agency
that rejected Ms. Sistrunk to reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our approach is toughness combined with natural mercy and
humanity,'' said Joseph Shuldiner, the housing authority's
executive director. ``We have to be realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   In moving, Ms. Sistrunk wanted dignity and choices for her
family.
</P>
<P>
   She lobbied housing officials until six of her grown children
got rent-subsidized apartments. Then her 24-year-old son, Joe, was
charged with cocaine possession and her two youngest children, 16
and 17, were charged with interfering with the police during the
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Charges against the teen-agers were dropped, but Joe was in jail
the day he was to sign his lease. The family sent his girlfriend to
sign for him.
</P>
<P>
   For herself and her two youngest children, Ms. Sistrunk wanted
one of the housing authority's new scattered-site apartments. She
rejected one. Twice, she accepted homes but was told they had been
taken. She phoned top-level housing officials. Two days before her
building was to be emptied, she rounded up other tenants and
threatened not to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tell me about one thing, then they switch it,'' she
thundered.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, while on vacation Ms. White, the housing authority
official supervising the relocation, guaranteed Ms. Sistrunk a
place that she wanted so she would not have to move to temporary
quarters. Aware of the Sistrunks' complicated history, Ms. White
decided they had great potential to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have some flexibility to look at people
individually,'' Ms. White said.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Ms. Sistrunk moved out, carrying an urn with the ashes
of her former husband, who died in March; salt for good luck; and
her daughter's prom glass, a proud symbol of her high school
graduation.
</P>
<P>
   She passed a drug dealer who was yelling ``Bubble on State,''
signaling that the police were nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so sick of that `Bubble on State,' '' she whispered.
``What they should have did is torn it down many years ago and
saved a lot of mothers' sons.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Everybody here is whispering about whispering about
everybody else's sex life.
</P>
<P>
   No one, of course, is recommending such talk. Heaven forbid. No
one wants the president's troubles to unleash a squinty-eyed
inquisition into the sexual mores of a publicly dull, prudish city
with a history of smeared lipstick behind closed office doors.
</P>
<P>
   But in the White House, on Capitol Hill and in political
consultancies and law firms, people say it will happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington is going to burn,'' predicted one prominent
Democrat here, while insisting that his camp would have nothing to
do with setting the blaze. The prospect of a report to Congress by
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr started the latest round of
expectant rumor-mongering.
</P>
<P>
   But predictions of a sexual Armageddon have been rife almost
since the president was first reported to have had an affair with
White House intern Monica Lewinsky. They have yet to come true.
While Ms. Lewinsky's dirty laundry _ literally _ has been aired in
press accounts, few others besides her and the president have been
seared so far.
</P>
<P>
   One exception is House Speaker Newt Gingrich, whose sexual past
was recently picked over in the online publication ``Salon.'' The
article reprised reporting in Vanity Fair three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the most prominent exception is Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., who
admitted Friday that he had had an extramarital relationship years
ago that produced a son. Earlier in the week, Burton had told
constituents of unspecified past troubles in his 38-year marriage,
saying he was motivated by the fear that Vanity Fair (again) was
about to publish scandalous details.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Burton's disclosure, jittery politicians were
admitting mistakes or declaring their virtue right and left.
Obliquely asked by reporters if marital faithfulness was properly
an issue in presidential contests, some have pre-emptively declared
themselves true to their wives. Texas Gov. George W. Bush has done
so, as has former Vice President Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   ``To run in 2000, as a prospective presidential candidate in
particular, you're going to have to be Mr. or Mrs. Clean,'' said
Greg Mueller, a Republican political strategist.
</P>
<P>
   The other approach _ admitting mistakes _ was on display last
week. In criticizing Clinton, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut
and several other Democratic senators practically stumbled over
each other in conceding, vaguely, transgressions (though not
necessarily sexual ones) in their personal lives. That technique
blunted not only any appearance of censoriousness, but also the
news hook that an accusation of hypocrisy might provide reporters.
</P>
<P>
   In admitting his mistakes, Burton blamed the White House for
putting Vanity Fair onto the story, an accusation dismissed by the
administration and the magazine. ``When it comes to anybody's
personal life, that's just off limits as far as we are concerned,''
said a White House spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials say that it would be stupid for them to
risk spreading sexual rumors, though they say they worry that rogue
aides might be freelancing.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists' willingness to poke into bedrooms is often traced _
wrongly _ to a challenge in 1987 by Gary Hart, then a Democratic
candidate for president, to a reporter from this newspaper.
``Follow me around,'' he said. ``I don't care. I'm serious. If
anybody wants to put a tail on me, go ahead. They'd be very
bored.'' In fact, by the time those words were published, people
already were tailing him. They weren't bored.
</P>
<P>
   Persistent rumors of Hart's womanizing appear to have piqued
reporters' interest, and let the genie out of the bottle. Then, in
1991, the face-off between Anita Hill and Supreme Court nominee
Clarence Thomas helped turn sexual behavior in the workplace into a
national issue. That set the stage for Sen. Bob Packwood's
resignation in 1995, after years of criticism and investigation of
his relations with women.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, presidential candidate Bill Clinton was beset by rumors
similar to those that dogged Hart. This time, a woman, Gennifer
Flowers, stepped forward to describe an affair. The accusation came
as Clinton was under fire for his honesty on issues like the
Vietnam draft. Reporters rolled such matters together under the
portentous-sounding heading of the ``character issue.''
</P>
<P>
   That journalistic approach seemed vindicated last week when
Lieberman delivered his speech. ``I know that the president is far
from alone in the wrongdoing he has admitted,'' he said. ``But the
president, by virtue of the office he sought and was elected to,
has traditionally been held to a higher standard.''
</P>
<P>
   During the last presidential campaign, the sex life of
Republican nominee Bob Dole came under scrutiny, but not only
potential presidents have been held to the higher standard. Dick
Morris, a Clinton political adviser, was accused in print of seeing
a prostitute. The story was deemed newsworthy in part because
Morris had devised a campaign emphasizing ``values.'' He was forced
to resign.
</P>
<P>
   After Morris, two Republican political consultants, Arthur
Finkelstein and Don Sipple, found their private lives explored in
magazines. (Last week, in Salon, Democratic consultant James
Carville argued that consultants should be exempted from such
prying. ``Isn't there a danger here that we might be going too
far?'' he wrote, with admitted self-interest.)
</P>
<P>
   Politicians and their advisers blame the news media in part for
legitimating and aiding attacks over private behavior, treating
people in politics more like Hollywood celebrities in a quest for
ratings and readers. Sensational stories like the O.J. Simpson
murder trial, according to this argument, addicted reporters and
editors even at once-staid organizations to sensational stories
that run for weeks like soap operas, but may have little policy
significance.
</P>
<P>
   In the view at least of Democrats here, Starr's inquiry into
Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky burned down any remaining
fences around politicians' _ and maybe prominent journalists' _
private lives.
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic political consultant Carter Eskew argued that the
Lewinsky matter demonstrated that while voters are disgusted by
adultery, they are also angered by people who dredge it up. Most
political candidates, he said, would not risk airing opponents'
sexual secrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end it's mutual assured destruction,'' he said. ``So it
won't happen.''

   Walking seems simple: You take your right foot and place it
ahead of your left. Then you take your left foot and place it ahead
of your right. Locomotion ensues. You may wish to vary the starting
foot. Left, right _ It's up to you.
</P>
<P>
   The point is, walking is a lot less complicated than the
hokey-pokey, but you don't see a lot of books written about the
hokey-pokey, even though pretty much everybody has to dance it at
weddings, sometimes drunk.
</P>
<P>
   Walking, on the other hand, has inspired dozens of books as well
as a glossy magazine in recent years _ a response to an
increasingly aging, sedentary and obese population that recognizes
the need to get off its collective keister but also says, ``Hey,
let's not overdo it.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, as walking has assumed a lucrative, baby-boomerish niche
in the consumer economy, this simple activity, in typically
American fashion, has become rocket science, brain surgery,
quasi-religious ritual and organizing principle of life all rolled
into one.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that's the impression you come away with after
perusing volumes like those excerpted below, lugged back to the
office after a recent foray into one of Manhattan's book
superstores.
</P>
<P>
   Before trying this or any other strenuous activity, consult your
physician.

   How-to-Walk Book No. 1: ``The 90-Day Fitness Walking Program''
by Mark Fenton and Seth Bauer (Perigee, 1995, 188 pages)
</P>
<P>
   Sample Workout: Day 1 . . . Walk out of your door and walk for
five minutes in any direction at any speed. Then turn around and
come home. That's it. You're done.
</P>
<P>
   How-to-Walk Book No. 2: ``Walking: A Complete Guide to the
Complete Exercise'' by Casey Meyers (Random House, 1992, 313 pages)
</P>
<P>
   Quote: I have worked with thousands of people in walking clinics
coast to coast. During this time two things have struck me as
funny. First, everybody drove to the clinic to learn how to walk,
and second, almost all knew more about how their cars functioned
than about how their bodies did.
</P>
<P>
   How-to-Walk Book No. 3: ``Walk Yourself Well'' by Sherry
Brourman, P.T., with Randy Rodman (Hyperion, 1998, 292 pages)
</P>
<P>
   Quote: Every step we take has two phases: a stance phase and a
swing phase. The stance phase is the part of walking when the foot
is touching the ground. The three parts to the stance phase are:
(1)  &UR; heel strike, &LR;  when only the heel is on the ground; (2)
 &UR; mid-stance, &LR;  when the foot and toes come to the ground; and (3)
 &UR; pushoff, &LR;  when the foot lifts onto the toe, which bend, squeeze
down, and propel us forward, mostly with the big and middle toe.
</P>
<P>
   The swing phase is everything that happens between the time that
the toes go airborne until the heel of the same foot strikes the
ground again. Both stance and swing phases play a primary role in
propelling us forward with optimal balance.

   How-to-Walk Book No. 4: ``Walking Fast: Techniques and Workouts
for High-Level Fitness and Performance'' by Therese Iknoian (Human
Kinetics, 1998, 183 pages)
</P>
<P>
   Quote: Walking is walking. That's it. You might go faster, or
you might go slower, but if you're putting one foot in front of the
other for your health, fitness or performance, you're walking.
</P>
<P>
   How-to-Walk Book No. 5: ``Walking'' by Ruth Rudner (Human
Kinetics, 1996, 120 pages)
</P>
<P>
   Quote: One bright autumn Sunday afternoon, I left the village of
Igls, a couple of miles from and a thousand feet above Innsbruck in
the Austrian Tyrol, to go for a walk. The air was crisp, the world
shimmering with the gold of larch trees and birches. The pretty
forest path was well-trod by about 200 years of walkers. I was
headed for a mountain hut a few miles distant for an afternoon of
coffee and cake. On the way, I came upon an old woman walking up
the path, holding the hand of a tiny girl. The girl was little
enough that walking must have been a new activity for her. The two
kept pace with one another, their footsteps matching. It struck me,
in that moment, that I was seeing the ending and the beginning of
life; that the rhythm of age and childhood were in accord; and that
all of this was happening on foot.

   How-to-Walk Book No. 6: ``JayWalking: the Ultimate Fitness
Journey'' by Jay Ciniglio (Berkley, 1998, 137 pages)
</P>
<P>
   Quote: The beauty of JayWalking is that it is a state of mind,
as well as a philosophy, and can be done anytime and anywhere, in
any footwear.

<P>
   How-to-Walk Book No. 7: ``The Spirited Walker: Fitness Walking
for Clarity, Balance and Spiritual Connection'' by Carolyn Scott
Kortge (HarperSanFrancisco, 1998, 253 pages)
</P>
<P>
   Quote: When you've had a day filled with activity and what you
need most is to quiet your mind so that you can reconnect with
nature _ and with your own divine nature _ experiment with
contemplative walking meditation. Pick a location where you can
focus fully on your steps. It might be a hallway or your living
room. Perhaps you know a quiet path outdoors. Lower your eyes and
turn your attention to your steps. Walk slowly, counting each step

<P>
   &UR; Groucho Walk  &LR; . . . Start walking, then bend your knees so you
are in a deep lunge position. Make sure your knees stay over your
heels (forming a 90-degree or wider angle at the knee) as you step
forward. Walk quickly in this squat position while pumping your
arms.

   &UR; Groucho Lay-Ups  &LR; . . . Take three Groucho steps beginning with
your right foot, then hop on the third step (on your right foot),

land, be sure to bend your knees to help absorb the impact. Take
three Groucho steps beginning with your left foot, hop on your
third step (on your left foot). Pump the arms as you Groucho-walk
and then swing them wider or shoot them overhead, as in basketball,
when you hop. Continue to step-step-step-shoot (on the count of 1,
2, 3, 4).

<P>
   &UR; Backward Groucho Walking Uphill  &LR; . . . Be sure the way is clear

   Walking seems simple: You take your right foot and place it
ahead of your left. Then you take your left foot and place it ahead
of your right. Locomotion ensues. You may wish to vary the starting
foot. Left, right _ It's up to you.
</P>
<P>
   The point is, walking is a lot less complicated than the
hokey-pokey, but you don't see a lot of books written about the
hokey-pokey, even though pretty much everybody has to dance it at
weddings, sometimes drunk.
</P>
<P>
   Walking, on the other hand, has inspired dozens of books as well
as a glossy magazine in recent years _ a response to an
increasingly aging, sedentary and obese population that recognizes
the need to get off its collective keister but also says, ``Hey,
let's not overdo it.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, as walking has assumed a lucrative, baby-boomerish niche
in the consumer economy, this simple activity, in typically
American fashion, has become rocket science, brain surgery,
quasi-religious ritual and organizing principle of life all rolled
into one.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that's the impression you come away with after
perusing volumes like those excerpted below, lugged back to the
office after a recent foray into one of Manhattan's book
superstores.
</P>
<P>
   Before trying this or any other strenuous activity, consult your
physician.

<P>
   Quote: I have worked with thousands of people in walking clinics
coast to coast. During this time two things have struck me as
funny. First, everybody drove to the clinic to learn how to walk,
and second, almost all knew more about how their cars functioned
than about how their bodies did.

   How-to-Walk Book No. 3: ``Walk Yourself Well'' by Sherry
Brourman, P.T., with Randy Rodman (Hyperion, 1998, 292 pages)
</P>
<P>
   Quote: Every step we take has two phases: a stance phase and a
swing phase. The stance phase is the part of walking when the foot
is touching the ground. The three parts to the stance phase are:
(1)  &UR; heel strike, &LR;  when only the heel is on the ground; (2)
 &UR; mid-stance, &LR;  when the foot and toes come to the ground; and (3)
 &UR; pushoff, &LR;  when the foot lifts onto the toe, which bend, squeeze
down, and propel us forward, mostly with the big and middle toe.
</P>
<P>
   The swing phase is everything that happens between the time that
the toes go airborne until the heel of the same foot strikes the
ground again. Both stance and swing phases play a primary role in
propelling us forward with optimal balance.

   Quote: Walking is walking. That's it. You might go faster, or
you might go slower, but if you're putting one foot in front of the
other for your health, fitness or performance, you're walking.

   How-to-Walk Book No. 5: ``Walking'' by Ruth Rudner (Human
Kinetics, 1996, 120 pages)
</P>
<P>
   Quote: One bright autumn Sunday afternoon, I left the village of
Igls, a couple of miles from and a thousand feet above Innsbruck in
the Austrian Tyrol, to go for a walk. The air was crisp, the world
shimmering with the gold of larch trees and birches. The pretty
forest path was well-trod by about 200 years of walkers. I was
headed for a mountain hut a few miles distant for an afternoon of
coffee and cake. On the way, I came upon an old woman walking up
the path, holding the hand of a tiny girl. The girl was little
enough that walking must have been a new activity for her. The two
kept pace with one another, their footsteps matching. It struck me,
in that moment, that I was seeing the ending and the beginning of
life; that the rhythm of age and childhood were in accord; and that
all of this was happening on foot.

</P>
<P>
   Quote: When you've had a day filled with activity and what you
need most is to quiet your mind so that you can reconnect with
nature _ and with your own divine nature _ experiment with
contemplative walking meditation. Pick a location where you can
focus fully on your steps. It might be a hallway or your living
room. Perhaps you know a quiet path outdoors. Lower your eyes and
turn your attention to your steps. Walk slowly, counting each step
in a pattern of one to four. When your attention strays, simply
begin the count again. Or focus on your breathing, blocking out
mental chatter by thinking ``in'' as you inhale and ``out'' as you
release each breath.

POSTCARDS FROM A WHAT-ME-WORRY SUMMER

   Sure, Jamie Dimon, the co-chairman of Salomon Smith Barney, had
to fly home from his August vacation in Europe when the market fell
over 500 points last week. But after noodling with his Bloomberg
terminal and conferring with colleagues, he headed right back once
the Dow regained some of its steadiness.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Daub, owner of Nantucket.net, an Internet cafe on the
Massachusetts island, noticed in recent weeks more people coming in
to check stock quotes _ most with a beach towel on one arm and a
smile.
</P>
<P>
   Now is the summer of our blithe ambivalence.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the country has been faced with weeks of
turmoil. ``If someone sat down on July Fourth and made a list of
predictions for the political and economic outlook, most of them
would have been wrong,'' said David Blitzer, chief economist at
Standard &AMP; Poor's Corp. in New York. ``Everyone thought Monica
Lewinsky would go away, she didn't. We thought we knew Russian
policy. People thought the Asia crisis was taking a step back, but
it reawakened.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Americans are far from depressed. News about falling
currencies, market fluctuations and sexual peccadilloes seem less
harbingers of bad times than distractions from the steak and hot
dogs on the grill. While a few polls indicate that some Americans
are concerned about the distant future, the reigning sentiment out
there now is one of relative satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public feels the media is out of touch with day-to-day
life,'' said Michael Harrison, editor of Talkers Magazine, a trade
publication for talk radio and television shows. ``It IS a time of
uncertainty, but people base their confidence or lack of it based
on what is happening in their own lives.''
</P>
<P>
   So where is the outrage, as Bob Dole once demanded? It is
apparently limited to those beachgoers vexed by the twittering
cellular phones of their neighbor on the next towel.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were pacing back and forth on the beach in East Hampton
looking very stressed,'' said Jason Weisenfeld, an executive at
Barneys New York. ``It was very out of character.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is not the lot of most Americans. Though more of them
own mutual funds today than before, most are passive investors,
doing pretty much what their broker tells them, and are in for the
long term. Those sophisticated enough to manage their own money are
far too wealthy to let one downturn scare them.
</P>
<P>
   With the horrific exception of recent terrorist bombings and
last week's airplane crash, many crises of the summer of 1998 have
lacked human drama. Who will say, as they did with the death of
Princess Diana, ``Where were you when Russia devalued the ruble?''
</P>
<P>
   Some, though, simply see opportunity in the losses. ``With the
Asia collapse, everyone says it is terrible,'' said Richard
Gelfond, the co-chief executive of Imax Corp., in a phone interview
from his home in Southampton. ``We are saying to theater owners
that real estate prices there have fallen so much that they can
open theaters at a fraction of the cost.''
</P>
<P>
   People who were more connected to the economic vicissitudes had
their summer vacations marred. ``When the world's events are
dominating the news, taking a vacation is not going to happen,''
lamented Lisa Berkowitz, the vice president and director of
marketing and communications for Harper Business, a unit of
HarperCollins, the publisher. ``Between the stock market and
Russia, everyone in public relations cringes. You're afraid to
leave the office.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are those who have taken vacations to give the
appearance of indifference to crisis _ only to have to cut them
short. Like Bill Clinton. Bringing his problems with him like so
much carry-on luggage, he went to Martha's Vineyard _ a place where
others may have been trying to escape him _ then promptly returned
home to deal with military action against terrorist targets.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of politics, things could be better. ``It has been a
rough summer for political folks,'' said Chris Lapetina, a partner
at Global Strategy Group, a democratic polling firm in New York,
where a primary election is just around the corner. ``Those who
think about the global financial situation are thinking about that
more than the political situation here, and that is very
frustrating for our candidates. People just are not focused in at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   And while many chief executives are relaxing at their summer
homes, some of the workers in Wall Street's trenches _ brokers,
traders and analysts _ will respond to the question of what they
did this summer with one word _ panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a prisoner of my own vacation,'' lamented Thomas Hanley,
a managing director at Warburg Dillon Read who analyzes bank
stocks. ``First, there was Hurricane Bonnie. Then, there was the
market. Calls. Faxes. Messages. Traders. Media. I've been doing
this for many years, but this has been the most difficult summer I
can remember in 25 years.'' Hanley was so stressed that he recently
locked himself out of his Southampton house.
</P>
<P>
   Abby Joseph Cohen, the investment strategist at Goldman, Sachs &AMP;
Co., simply took her computer along on vacation. During market
turmoil in early August, she sent reassuring faxes from Israel to
clients. ``Nothing ruined my wonderful trip,'' she said. ``I don't
ever really turn off. I go into standby mode.''

A MID-CAREER CRISIS: AIKMAN AND COWBOYS STARTING OVER 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ It could have been first down or third down, a
critical call or simply the continuation of an exacting drive
toward the end zone. Troy Aikman, the Dallas Cowboys quarterback,
would walk to the sideline last season and talk it over. Run or
pass? Hit the middle or attack the outside? Remain in the pocket or
try something on the run?
</P>
<P>
   Aikman would seek answers with the Dallas coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   But the answers would not come directly from Barry Switzer, then
the head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never spoke to Barry,'' Aikman said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Never say never. But Aikman does.
</P>
<P>
   He says a lot by saying little about Switzer. The two did not
click. Maybe it was a lack of respect or resentment or different
personalties. Whatever it was, it was the backdrop for Dallas'
winning Super Bowl XXX in 1996. It was the stage on which the
Cowboys dropped dead, to a 6-10 record last season, missing the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   There was trouble in Dallas last season with players that were
viewed as hooligans-in-chaos, there was trouble in the offense
(gone stale), with the defense (too leaky), and with the personnel
(no longer Pro-Bowl laden). There was frustration and shoddy
execution and injury. Seemingly, suddenly, Dallas looked a lot as
it did when Aikman first arrived in 1989 from UCLA as the National
Football League's No. 1 draft pick. It was a 1-15 team that first
Aikman season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The discouraging thing is that we allowed this franchise to
fall to 6-10,'' Aikman said, with a fidgeting hand and a twisted
face. ``For those of us who were here in '89 and knew how hard we
had to work to get to be a Super Bowl team, it was awfully hard. I
never thought we would ever get back to where we would be a
rebuilding team, and I use that word loosely. I expect to win now.
But to win Super Bowls again, yes, that might take some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't a real talented group in '89 and it was implied
that I was going to be the guy that we were going to build around.
We already had Michael Irvin in place. That second year we drafted
Emmitt Smith. The third year Norv Turner arrived as offensive
coordinator. It all fell into place. This is the most change in
this organization right now since '89. Now, you can look at change
in many different ways. Stability was missing. But I see Chan
Gailey as a coach who can be here for a long time. I'm not the
first one to go down this chute.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not. Because he has been there before. Right in
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Starting over.
</P>
<P>
   And that makes it an exciting yet harried time for Troy Aikman,
31, a three-time Super Bowl champion quarterback, the Cowboys'
career leading passer who holds or is tied for 42 Dallas passing
records, a man with an 11-2 record in post-season play. A player
viewed as the conscience in the Dallas locker room and one with
clout. Enough to help force Switzer's departure. Enough for the new
Dallas coach, Gailey, to replace Switzer.
</P>
<P>
   As the NFL season opens Sunday, quarterbacks around the league
face enormous and persistent pressure. Quarterbacks color the
personalities of their teams. They get too much credit and they get
too much blame, but it has always been that way.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman takes a peek around the league and sees Kordell Stewart
in Pittsburgh routinely expected, in only his second year as a
starter, to keep the Steelers at the top of the Super Bowl chase.
He sees Gus Frerotte in Washington under monumental pressure. He
says that Elvis Grbac in Kansas City is in a tough spot with a team
that soared in the regular season, but crashed in the playoffs last
year.
</P>
<P>
   He need only look in the mirror, however, to find that he is the
quarterback who faces the toughest scrutiny this fall. He is the
National Football League's highest-paid quarterback, with a
contract that averages $6.2 million a year. His team is the one
that America loves and hates. His team is down and he has to pick
it up. He asked for a new head coach, and he got one.
</P>
<P>
   Now what?
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people feel I am the cause for lots of changes here but
that is not entirely true,'' Aikman said. ``I have been vocal the
last couple of years, but changes would have been made whether I
was vocal or not. I feel very fortunate that I have an owner in
Jerry Jones who is committed to winning. I am fortunate that I have
an owner who takes into consideration my opinions. I am not above
enough to think that I am always right or that what I say goes. And
when you have a voice like that, you have to be able to handle it.
I have never gotten caught up in it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Aikman wanted Turner, currently the Washington Redskins' head
coach, to replace Switzer. Aikman and Turner are special friends.
``We talk weekly,'' Aikman said. ``We had a special relationship
from Day 1. We are similar in our approach. We are not afraid to be
honest or optimistic. Winning counts for us. He was here for three
years, and I credit Norv for a large part of any success I've had.
He came as a first-time offensive coordinator and I came as a young
quarterback seeking success. I needed him and he needed me.
Together, we flourished.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas could not work a deal to get Turner. But in Gailey,
Aikman has a head coach who, for the first time, will personally
call Aikman's plays. He has a coach he can talk to. He likes that.
</P>
<P>
   He has a new offense for the first time in seven years. Before,
the Dallas passing game under Aikman featured mostly strict pocket
passing and holding on to the ball longer. Then an addition was
made with five-to-seven-step drops and quick releases. Now Gailey
will employ Aikman in those ways and more: the shotgun, moving the
pocket, rollout passes and more throws downfield. Aikman likes
that, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have a quarterback with the physical skills and intellect
of Troy and not even make the playoffs,'' Jones said, ``to not give
him a chance to get to the Super Bowl while he is in the prime of
his career was tough to take last year. I just never thought that
would happen. Some of it was my fault. I did not get him the
offensive line he needed and that will never happen again. But I
say with no question that we believe in Troy on and off the field.
You can see why he is our Rembrandt.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman has become an ambassador for pro football well beyond
Dallas. Last year he was named the National Football League Man of
the Year, the most prestigious honor a player can receive for
off-the-field service and charity. Aikman has four seasons left on
his Dallas contract. He knows he is lucky that during the off
season he was treated successfully for a cancerous tumor that was
detected on his back. He has sustained enough concussions in his
nine pro seasons to provide a scare, but not to prevent him from
continuing to play. His dream is to one day play again for Turner.
But he has bigger dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commitment I have made here is for the long haul,'' Aikman
said. ``I have tried to become numb and desensitized to all of the
attention. I don't know if you ever really master that. I have
never gotten comfortable with my role as the quarterback of this
franchise. My role in the scheme of all things is very short-lived.
This is a fleeting experience in the course of my lifetime. I will
attempt to enjoy it for whatever it brings.''
</P>
<P>
   This season for Aikman could be one of pure frustration. Or
wonderful surprise. It will be packed with pressure because he is
starting over again. Going down that chute again.
</P>
<P>
   He eagerly awaits the ride. ``But if you had asked me that
question a year ago,'' he said, ``I might have had a different
answer.''

<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. _ Not so long ago, state Sen. Edward Warren ran
for re-election every two years by handing out combs. Thousands of
combs. Thousands of green combs (because Warren is from Greenville)
with his name embossed in white type.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd go out to the restaurants where the farmers go for
breakfast, like Tom's in Greenville and Bum's in Ayden, and I'd
pass out my combs,'' said Warren, a 68-year-old former high school
principal who has served in North Carolina's Legislature for 18
years. ``I'd always just tell people that I don't have any hair, so
I have no need for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren, a Democrat, still hands out combs. But in the past four
years, he has also become conversant in the modern politics of
television advertising buys, polling cross-tabulations and targeted
direct mail. While he once spent no more than $30,000 to hold on to
his state Senate seat, his 1996 campaign cost $210,000. This year,
he may have to spend more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just out of control,'' Warren said. ``I never thought I'd
see it in my career, but that's the real world in North Carolina
these days.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it has become the real world for lawmakers in virtually
every statehouse in the 1990s. With partisan control of
legislatures at risk in a remarkable number of states, and with
states inheriting vast new responsibilities from Washington, the
once-quaint business of legislative politics has become intensely
competitive, sophisticated and costly.
</P>
<P>
   After decades of hidebound, one-party domination, nearly a third
of all legislative chambers are now within theoretical striking
distance of a switch in partisan control. In several chambers, like
the Michigan House of Representatives, the California Assembly and
the Wisconsin Senate, control has changed multiple times in the
last six years.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, some states have long had closely contested and
relatively expensive legislative elections, but now even the
once-solid South, where the state legislatures were the last
bastion of Democratic control, is in play.
</P>
<P>
   This new competitiveness, driven largely by Republican inroads
in this decade, has led to a sea change in the tactics of
legislative campaigning, said dozens of lawmakers, political
consultants and authorities on state government interviewed last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Television advertising was once considered absurdly inefficient
in legislative races because media markets are typically far larger
than districts. But it is now commonplace, and not just on cable.
Legislative leaders make extensive use of polling to determine how
to allocate their party caucuses' financial resources. Partisan
messages and policy positions are crafted with the help of focus
groups.
</P>
<P>
   With states playing a crucial role in welfare, education,
taxation and criminal justice, the national political parties are
placing renewed emphasis on legislative campaigns, and so are
various interest groups. And the political stakes are only rising,
since the elections in 1998 and 2000 will determine which parties
control the redistricting process after the next census.
</P>
<P>
   All of that has led to skyrocketing costs _ and a need for
ever-greater fund-raising. ``Targeted races are running two to
three times what they cost in the early '90s,'' said Kevin Mack,
director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. ``It's
almost a congressionalization of state legislative campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   In California two years ago, two assemblymen, Rusty Areias and
Bruce McPherson, spent a combined $3.49 million in trying to move
up to the state Senate, a race won by McPherson, a Republican.
Total spending on legislative races in that state increased to $105
million in 1995-96 from $15 million in 1975-76, the secretary of
state reported.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina's recent experience demonstrates that campaign
inflation is not limited to large states with high advertising
rates. As the General Assembly here has become a partisan
battleground, with the Republicans gaining a slim majority in the
House of Representatives in 1994, the cost of campaigning has
soared.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, candidates from the two major parties in North Carolina
spent a total of $13.6 million on their campaigns, according to a
study by Thad Beyle, a political scientist at the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill. After accounting for inflation, that
was an increase of 81 percent over the amount spent in 1994, and an
increase of 172 percent over 1992, Beyle reported.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason for the increase in spending is that legislative
politics have destabilized in the 1990s after decades of calm.
</P>
<P>
   From 1972 to 1994, Democrats were as prevalent in state
legislatures as plaid sportcoats. They controlled the majority of
statehouses and exerted little effort in maintaining their power.
They were particularly dominant in the South in those years, a
period when Democrats controlled every legislative chamber and
never held fewer than 71 percent of the region's legislative seats,
according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, the Democratic campaign strategy consisted of
little more than ``hearing at the grocery store that Senator Joe
was in trouble and sending him $500,'' said Sen. Roy Cooper, the
Democratic majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1994, as Republicans took control of Congress, they also
asserted themselves on the state level. Republicans entered that
election with control of 8 legislatures and emerged with 19, while
the Democrats were left with 18. Twelve legislatures were divided
with each party controlling one chamber. (Nebraska has a unicameral
Legislature whose members run in nonpartisan elections.)
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, the Democrats rebounded a bit, taking control
in 20 states to the Republicans' 18, with 11 states divided. In the
South, Democrats hold only 62 percent of all seats, and Republicans
control both chambers in Florida and Virginia, as well as the House
of Representatives in North Carolina and South Carolina and the
state Senate in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This year, in the 46 states with elections in at least one
house, the parties are separated by six seats or fewer in 23
chambers, a staggering level of competitiveness. Adding to the
instability is the onset of term limits, which will dislodge large
numbers of incumbents in several states. In Michigan, for instance,
where Democrats hold a six-seat majority in the House, term limits
will open 67 of 110 seats this year. In the Arkansas House, 49 of
100 seats will be open because of term limits.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the new spending in legislative campaigns is fattening
the wallets of pollsters and consultants who have nudged
legislative candidates into the modern age. Democratic pollster
Alan Secrest said that close to a third of his firm's revenues now
come from legislative candidates, as against less than 1 percent
only four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these legislators think that their 65 million years
aren't up yet and that another campaign of flatbed trucks and
pocket combs will carry the day,'' Secrest said. ``But incumbents
don't take these races for granted in Congress anymore and they
better not do it in legislatures either or they'll wind up as
dinosaurs.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as they consult pollsters and cut television ads, many
lawmakers lament that the new professionalism of legislative
politics has transformed their political culture.
</P>
<P>
   Like their congressional counterparts, they complain that fund
raising monopolizes their time. The reliance on big money has given
new power to legislative leaders and their centralized fund-raising
committees, which collect contributions for their party caucuses
and then distribute cash to the most vulnerable members. It has
heightened the influence of lobbyists, interest groups and
political action committees.
</P>
<P>
   Here in North Carolina, Sen. John Kerr, a Democrat from
Goldsboro, used to shun contributions from political action
committees on principle. This year, he said, he can no longer
afford to be pure. ``When your opponent is running 30-second
commercials and dropping all these mailings,'' Kerr said, ``you've
got to be able to combat that, to do background research, to
poll.''
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Daniel Blue Jr., a Democrat from Raleigh and a former
speaker of the House, said the cost of campaigning had made public
service ``unachievable for ordinary folk.'' The influence of
check-bearing lobbyists, he said, ``just pervades everything that
goes on here.''
</P>
<P>
   All too often, he added, policy proposals seem to be crafted by
out-of-state pollsters with an eye on November. Compromise is often
sacrificed in the name of political positioning. Last week, for
instance, the General Assembly here was deadlocked over a proposal
by House Republicans to eliminate the state's inheritance tax.
State Senate Democrats agreed to a partial repeal, but Republicans
did not budge. ``Apparently it polls very well,'' Blue said.
</P>
<P>
   The impasse in Raleigh has contributed to the longest
legislative session in the state's history. And legislative leaders
worry that the demands on lawmakers' time will make it difficult to
recruit candidates for an increasingly full-time job that pays
$13,951 a year and $104 a day in expenses. Sen. Leslie J. Winner, a
respected Democrat from Charlotte, is quitting this year after
three terms because the job now keeps her apart too often from her
9-year-old daughter, Lily. One of Lily's poems, which Ms. Winner
has posted in her office, is ``dedicated to my mother, who's always
in Raleigh.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Rosenthal, a political scientist at Rutgers University,
said it was important to remember that two-party politics is often
a good thing. But, he said, ``like anything else, it's got a down
side.''

NORTH KOREA DESIGNATES KIM `GREAT LEADER' 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ North Korea became the first Communist country to
transfer government power within a family dynasty on Saturday, as
it anointed Marshal Kim Jong Il as its ``Great Leader'' and head of
an expanded National Defense Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, Kim, the eldest son of former ``Great Leader'' Kim Il
Sung, who died four years ago, will govern in much the style of an
ancient Korean king, ruling absolutely and inheriting legitimacy
not from institutions but from the bloodline of the previous ruler.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's announcement did not specify what would happen to the
presidency, but there have been reports that it will be abolished
and the position held forever by Kim's late father. While many
countries have had presidents for life, North Korea apparently
would become the first nation to extend the concept.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement, and the consolidation of power by Kim Jong Il,
ends the four-year interregnum left by the death of Kim Il Sung.
The younger Kim had already assumed the top positions in the ruling
party and the army, and now he effectively adds a job as head of
the state itself.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts expect few immediate changes because Kim has been
running North Korea since his father's death. But some say that the
coronation of a new king permits the country to experiment
carefully with new policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's less ideological than his father and he represents a
different generation,'' said Han Park, a political scientist at the
University of Georgia who regularly visits North Korea. ``He's much
more pragmatic.''
</P>
<P>
   North Korea now refers to Kim as ``Great Leader,'' instead of
the ``Dear Leader'' title he carried while his father was alive.
</P>
<P>
   But the Korean expressions used are still different from the one
that was reserved for his father, although the younger Kim is
hailed in terms that could scarcely be grander.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is an outstanding thinker and theoretician, a distinguished
statesman and a peerlessly brilliant commander who has ushered in a
heyday of the era of the Workers Party, an era of great prosperity
of socialist Korea,'' the official Korean Central News Agency
declared Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   If North Korea is one of the most perplexing of nations, Kim
Jong Il is among the most mysterious of leaders. Intelligence
experts believe that he may have several nuclear weapons, making
him the least understood of any leader with a finger on a nuclear
trigger.
</P>
<P>
   Kim, 56, has traveled outside his country only once, to China in
1983, and has never met a non-Communist. Although he is hailed in
North Korea as a virtual deity, his voice has been broadcast only
once, when a television clip showed him addressing a military
parade with a brief slogan: ``Glory be to the heroic officers and
men of the Korean People's Army!''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts see him as a maniac, noting that he has been
accused of kidnapping a South Korean actor-and-actress couple whose
work he admired, of planning the bombing of the South Korean
Cabinet in 1983, and of plotting the bombing of a civilian South
Korean airliner in 1987. The woman who planted the bomb, Kim Hyon
Hee, said that Kim Jong Il ordered the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Others say that he lacks his father's charisma but appears to be
intelligent and relatively open-minded. Tape-recordings of private
conversations in which he frankly acknowledges the economic
inefficiency of socialism were smuggled out of North Korea several
years ago, and a defector who claims to have lived in his house
says that Kim worked hard, had a computer on his desk and watched
CNN and other foreign television networks.
</P>
<P>
   That defector, Lee Nam Ok, who is now living in hiding in
Europe, told a Japanese magazine that she never saw any sign that
Kim was a temperamental playboy _ as he is sometimes described. She
recounted Kim's life in his compound as luxurious, with air
conditioning and a huge playroom full of slot machines and other
toys for his son to play with, and she said that he sent his son to
a boarding school in Switzerland to gain exposure to the outside
world.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual and remarkably moderate essay last year Kim called
for improved relations with South Korea and the United States. But
then Kim presumably was also behind a series of commando missions
in which submarines dropped off armed troops on the South Korean
shores, and he has resisted calls for a summit meeting by South
Korea's president, Kim Dae Jung.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea remains the most mobilized and rigidly controlled
society in the world, comparable with the Soviet Union under
Stalin. But in recent years, there have been signs of change in
North Korea, including the emergence of small-scale free markets in
some towns, and the country has also sought foreign investment,
particularly in a special investment zone in the far northeast.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   In another sign of change at the edges, North Koreans outside
the country seem increasingly casual in what they say, sometimes
even urging that one not pay too much attention to their country's
official statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please forget the North Korean rhetoric,'' said Kim Myong
Chol, an unofficial spokesman for North Korea based in Tokyo.
``North Korea is headed for North Korea's version of a free-market
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim Myong Chol, who previously edited a North Korean-backed
newspaper in Japan and still regularly visits North Korea to confer
with officials, said that he expected that Kim Jong Il's ascension
would over time lead to more flexible policies.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the effective abolition of the presidency
complicates an already muddy picture at what seems to be a crucial
time in North Korean history. Millions of North Koreans are widely
believed to be on the edge of starvation and the economy has
largely collapsed because of energy shortages, mismanagement and
natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
   There are widely diverging estimates of the seriousness of the
food shortages. By all accounts, hunger is widespread and is
causing some death, but some estimates are that the death toll is
modest while others range up to the millions.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea refuses visits by most foreigners, so it is
difficult to gauge the true level of suffering.
</P>
<P>
   A landmark agreement reached in 1994, under which North Korea
agreed to give up its nuclear program in exchange for energy from
the West, now appears to be in jeopardy because of recriminations
and ill feeling on both sides. If that agreement is completely
breached, North Korea may revive its nuclear program, leading to a
renewed confrontation between North Korea and Western powers.
</P>
<P>
   Many diplomats and scholars now say that the last such showdown,
in 1994, came much closer to war than was generally known at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   The tensions were underscored in the last week when North Korea
launched a multi-stage rocket that sailed over Japan, prompting a
furious reaction from the Japanese government. Western officials
say that the rocket was a test of a new class of North Korean
ballistic missile capable of carrying chemical weapons or a nuclear
warhead, while North Korea says it was simply a launch of a
satellite.
</P>
<P>
   Western scholars say that Kim was born in a camp in the Soviet
Union, where his father was based as a guerrilla fighting the
Japanese forces then occupying Korea. But North Korea says that Kim
was born on Mount Paektu, a sacred mountain in Korean history.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has often claimed magical associations with Kim.
Last fall, when he was named leader of the ruling Workers Party,
the official news media announced that flowers suddenly bloomed and
that a magical white sea cucumber entered a fisherman's net ``to
hail the auspicious event'' of Kim's rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing the mysterious natural phenomena, Koreans say Comrade
Kim Jong Il is indeed the greatest of great men produced by heaven
and that flowers come into bloom to mark the great event,'' the
official news agency declared at the time.

<P>
   NOVGOROD, Russia _ Russia's currency may be tumbling. Its stock
market may lie in ruins. But Yevgeny Shulman is used to operating
without money.
</P>
<P>
   Shulman's factory churns out valves for nuclear power plants and
heavy industry. What his company receives in return is clear from a
stroll around headquarters: Newly minted cars and trucks are lined
up near small mountains of railroad-car brake pads and raw metal.
</P>
<P>
   Shulman even set up a small chain of drug stores to sell the
medicines he receives in his transactions with drug companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the way everybody in Russia does business these
days,'' Shulman said. ``Of course, we'd prefer to receive cash. But
it is barter that has saved us.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russian companies have
coped with a mountain of debt by developing a special brand of
cashless capitalism. Now, with economic shockwaves rippling across
Russia, companies are counting more than ever on barter to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Western economists ridicule the barter economy as a perversion
of the free market, noting that it distorts prices and makes a
mockery of tax collection. But barter also reflects gritty
determination to get by without the bank credits and investment
capital that fuel Western-style capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every Russian city has a tale of factory workers who
are paid in glassware or pantyhose. Teachers in Voronezh, 300 miles
south of Moscow, recently received headstones; the government
wanted to give the teachers a product that is in constant demand
and which they can easily turn into cash.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the barter economy, however, is far more elaborate.
Russian industry increasingly depends on Rube Goldberg-type schemes
in which goods are shipped across the country in complex swaps that
can involve a dozen enterprises or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy has already adjusted to the lack of money and is
ready to abide without it,'' the reformist Boris Nemtsov, now
ousted from the Kremlin, predicted this summer.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows the barter business better than Shulman, 43, the
general director of Splav and a chain-smoking perpetual-motion
machine. In four years he has expanded the company's work force to
4,000 from 500 and raised revenues to $80 million a year _ mostly
by barter.
</P>
<P>
   Shulman founded Splav (which means alloy in Russian) after the
collapse of the Soviet Union, hoping to carve a niche as a
manufacturer of scientific instruments.
</P>
<P>
   That business faltered, but in 1994 Shulman and his partners
acquired control of a valve factory in Novgorod, a storied city of
cathedrals 300 miles northeast of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The factory had a long tradition of doing quality work but was
bankrupt. Worse, its potential customers _ state-owned Russian
nuclear plants and privatized metal, chemical and oil industries _
had no cash.
</P>
<P>
   So Shulman assigned the best of his staff _ some of whom ran
factories in Soviet times _ to rebuild the business without money.
Today 50 executives work full time putting together barter deals,
building transactions around debt-burdened utilities, rail lines,
nuclear power plants and metal factories.
</P>
<P>
   Splav uses barter for just about everything. Railroad-car brake
pads are used to pay rail tariffs, which have been kept
artificially high to subsidize passenger travel. Barter gives
Shulman some flexibility to maneuver around such pricing.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a lot of savvy people in business, barter's a way to get
around a rigid pricing system and make more sales,'' said David
Woodruff, a visiting professor at European University in St.
Petersburg.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Splav gives the Novgorod city administration Volga sedans in
lieu of some local taxes. It pays the state road tax with
construction equipment. Company medical insurance is paid for with
ambulances.
</P>
<P>
   During Soviet times, barter was used between Communist bloc
countries. Ordinary citizens also learned to barter to maneuver
around shortages. But it was only after the collapse of the Soviet
Union that corporate barter soared. A government survey of 210 of
the biggest companies in Russia indicates that more than 70 percent
of their receipts are non-monetary. But Splav cannot do entirely
without money. The company needs cash to pay salaries and federal
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Barter plays the critical role is raising cash. Shulman's
customers may not be able to pay for his valves, but that does not
mean the company cannot trade them for items that Russian
businesses or consumers might actually buy with money. Cars, metal
and diesel fuel, Shulman patiently explains, are ``liquid'' goods.
</P>
<P>
   The catch is that the goods Splav receives often must be sold at
a discount. That in turn forces the company to raise the price of
its valves in barter terms. That practice, which is endemic,
distorts prices and plays havoc with traditional accounting,
critics say.
</P>
<P>
   Because Splav marks up its prices, it ships about $135 million
in valves and pipes each year. But because it sells the goods it
gets below market prices, it receives about $80 million in revenue.
While that may appear to be a loss, Shulman figures his real profit
is about 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Barter is also an enormous drain on manpower. Even in an age of
fax machines and computers, transactions need to be sealed in
person, and working out the angles takes months.
</P>
<P>
   The company's top negotiators fly as far as Siberia, Kazakhstan
or Ukraine to work out the contracts, which need to be signed at
each of the links in the chain.

   Anatoly Fedotov, 42, used to be a high-ranking factory manager.
Like most former Communist managers, he says he had little
experience with barter deals during Soviet times. Now his job is to
keep the barter chains linked to support millions of dollars in
sales to three nuclear power plants.
</P>
<P>
   Decked out in a dark purple suit, he explains that he hits the
road after the preliminaries are worked out, armed with the
authority to seal the deal. His job requires both business acumen
and technical knowledge of the goods traded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The responsibility is pretty high,'' he said. ``The
transactions are huge.''
</P>
<P>
   Top barter negotiators receive $1,000 a month, a hefty sum in
provincial Novgorod and five times the wage of one of Splav's
factory workers. But the negotiators are the key to survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Setting up a barter chain is a tedious and long process,''
said Shulman. ``Can you imagine what we could accomplish if we
could use these people to do something else? We could penetrate new
markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Splav's sale of quality valves to the Balakovo nuclear power
station in southern Russia shows the lengths the company often has
to go to.
</P>
<P>
   The Balakovo plant cannot pay in cash; it has more debtors than
paying customers. For Splav's ingenious staff, that was an
opportunity, not a roadblock. After dogged negotiations, they
negotiated a barter chain that zig-zags through Russia and other
former Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
   In return for the valves it receives from Splav, the Balakovo
nuclear power forgives part of the debt for electricity from a
factory in nearby Uralsk, Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   The Uralsk factory then ships metal castings to a factory in
Blagoveshchensk, which is located in the Russian republic of
Bashkiriya.
</P>
<P>
   The Blagoveshchensk factory makes a different type of valve than
Splav. It carries the chain a step further by sending some to
Splav.
</P>
<P>
   But the swaps do not stop there.
</P>
<P>
   Splav needs to take the Blagoveshchensk valves and turn them
into ``liquid'' goods it can sell for cash. So Splav ships some to
the Lipetsk Metallurgical Combine, south of Moscow. Lipetsk, in
turn, provides sheet metal to a half dozen car and truck factories
in Russia and Belarus.
</P>
<P>
   The vehicle manufacturers then ship cars and trucks to Splav,
which sells some for cash and uses others to pay some of its taxes.
</P>
<P>
   It generally takes a year for Splav to receive payment for the
valves it ships to the Balakovo plant. Nor is this the end of the
chain.
</P>
<P>
   Splav also sends the some of the Blagoveshchensk valves to the
Norilsk Metallurgical Combine in northern Siberia. In return it
receives nickel and copper, which it sells in Russia and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The current financial crisis has been hard on the company. It
lost $2 million when the government abruptly devalued the ruble and
rescheduled its short-term debt repayments. Splav has frozen
hiring, cut costs and forsworn exorbitant bank credits.
</P>
<P>
   But the barter team is still busy.
</P>
<P>
   Marching through one of his warehouses, Shulman pointed toward a
pile of sheets of nickel, the fruit of a barter deal with Norilsk
Nickel.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' he said with evident satisfaction, ``is our strategic
reserve.''

<P>
   NKOREA-KIM (Tokyo) _ North Korea on Saturday became the first
Communist country to transfer government power within a family
dynasty, as it anointed Marshal Kim Jong Il as its ``Great Leader''
and head of an expanded National Defense Commission. By Nicholas D.
Kristof.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-JAPAN-SPLIT (San Francisco) _ The economic policy leaders
of the world's two largest economies, the United States and Japan,
spent hours here Friday night talking about the heightened risk of
global recession and a further spread of the turmoil that has
engulfed Asia, Russia and now Latin America. But they left Saturday
morning with no new plans, and an uneasy sense that Japan and the
United States remain on different wavelengths about how quickly
countries must act. By David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-BANKS (Moscow) _ As the ruble continues to crumble and
increasing numbers of insolvent banks are brought under state
control, untold numbers of Russians are left with the unenviable
choice of leaving their savings in barren banks or allowing the
accounts to be transferred to a state-owned bank at a fraction of
their value. By Timothy L. O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-ASSESS (Limerick, Ireland) _ It has been a question from
the start of President Clinton's five-day trip to Russia, Ireland
and Northern Ireland this week: will his domestic troubles affect
his ability to function abroad as the nation's leader? By John M.
Broder.
</P>

Bin Laden, who has been linked to a terror campaign against the
United States. By James Risen.
</P>
<P>
   INDONESIA-CHINESE (Jakarta, Indonesia) _ Though they make up
little more than 3 percent of Indonesia's population of more than
200 million, ethnic Chinese are the nation's trading class, from
shopkeepers to billionaire managers of multinational conglomerates,
and they control as much as 70 percent of the Indonesia's private
economy. They are also often the target of scapegoatism for the
nation's ills. By Seth Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   JORDAN-KING (Kerak, Jordan) _ King Hussein has reigned for 45
years, more than twice as long as Ahmed Thneibat has been alive.
But now the king is undergoing cancer treatment for the second time
in six years, and Thneibat and other Jordanians are apprehensive
about what is to come. By Douglas Jehl.
</P>
<P>
   GERMAN-KOHL-HEIR (Bonn, Germany) _ In dire straits, a political
party taps its most popular figure to lead the campaign to cling to
power. Right? Wrong, at least in Germany. As this country heads for
a national election on Sept. 27 that will chart its course into the
21st century, the focus for many people is on whether Chancellor
Helmut Kohl will survive. Behind him, though, there is a figure far
less known outside Germany, but just as familiar to Germans,
Wolfgang Schaeuble. By Alan Cowell.

to it. By Judith Miller.
</P>
<P>
   NORTHWEST-STRIKE _ Northwest Airlines says that the only issue
in the week-old strike by its 6,200 pilots is pay. The pilots
counter that job security as well as money are the two big hurdles
standing in the way of a settlement. But the real issue that has
divided the two sides _ leading to the longest airline strike since
maintenance workers shut down Eastern Airlines in 1989 _ seems to
be trust. By Laurence Zuckerman.
</P>
<P>
   FLA-CUBA-EXCHANGE (Miami Beach) _ For Carlos Varela, who sings
of present-day Cuba, warts and all, playing Miami meant the first
few baby steps into a market virtually closed to him because he
lives in Cuba. In cultural exchanges allowed in recent years under
the American economic embargo of the island, Cuba-based artists
have toured all over the United States, but they have generally
skipped Miami, where many Cuban-Americans shun them as envoys of
the Cuban government and take offense at their presence in exile
territory. By Mireya Navarro.

U.S. AND JAPANESE OFFICIALS SPLIT ON SERIOUS OF ECONOMIC CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The economic policy leaders of the world's two
largest economies, the United States and Japan, spent hours here
Friday night talking about the heightened risk of global recession
and a further spread of the turmoil that has engulfed Asia, Russia
and now Latin America. But they left Saturday morning with no new
plans, and an uneasy sense that Japan and the United States remain
on different wavelengths about how quickly countries must act.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion over dinner on Nob Hill included Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan,
and Kiichi Miyazawa, the former prime minister who reluctantly
agreed to take the job of finance minister last month during
Japan's deepest recession since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   At the dinner's end, American officials said they feared that
Japan's leaders still did not accept the premise that Japan's huge
banking crisis and its moribund economy were a major cause of the
turmoil that included a stomach-churning dive on Wall Street this
week, huge market drops and instability in Latin America and
deepening chaos in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The astounding descent of the ruble, which has dropped 63
percent since Aug. 17 and has already begun to create food
shortages and tremendous inflation, led the British government on
Saturday to announce that a meeting of deputy finance ministers
from the world's largest economic powers, the Group of 7, was
planned in London, probably in the coming week, to map out a new
Russia strategy.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sign of the growing split between Tokyo and Washington,
Japanese officials bristled at the mounting American pressure and
suggested that they were being made scapegoats for problems that
are unrelated to Tokyo's seven years of economic mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can Japan's recession be responsible for an economic
malaise in Latin America or Russia?'' asked a senior Japanese
official, who insisted on anonymity. ``Japan has been overly
criticized. My concern is that if anything happens to the U.S.
economy, everyone will point to Japan and say it is responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting took place as Rubin and Greenspan, who in ordinary
times often outdo each other at understatement, issued warnings
that the world economy is in a particularly fragile state.
</P>
<P>
   Only hours before the dinner, Greenspan, in a speech at the
University of California at Berkeley, cautioned that ``it is just
not credible that the United States can remain an oasis of
prosperity unaffected by a world that is experiencing greatly
increased stress.'' He appeared to open the door to the possibility
that the Federal Reserve might consider a cut in interest rates if
more evidence arose that downturns on three continents were
beginning to stall the American economy.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin, in a conversation as he flew from Washington to his
meeting here, said that ``these are clearly extremely difficult
times in the world economy and world financial markets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an unprecedented situation in a host of respects,''
said the treasury secretary, who experienced several major market
drops in his 26 years on Wall Street as a trader and then
co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs, the investment banking firm. ``The
number of countries experiencing difficulties at once is something
we have not seen before.''
</P>
<P>
   The speed at which hundreds of billions of dollars that flowed
into emerging economies in the 1990s have flowed out was also
unprecedented. The inflow occurred, Rubin said, because ``investors
got progressively less rigorous about risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Now they see risk everywhere, Rubin and other treasury officials
note, and they rarely discriminate between countries with deep
problems and countries that are simply fighting off economic
contagion. A global credit crunch has resulted, with countries that
lived off of huge flows of international investment now unable to
obtain it at any price.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a situation which is indeed a dangerous one, by far
not fully rational,'' said Michel Camdessus, the managing director
of the embattled International Monetary Fund, which has been
charged by its many critics with exacerbating the crisis it stepped
in to abate.
</P>
<P>
   Camdessus, speaking in Washington at the conclusion of a meeting
of Latin American finance ministers who had come to plead for
relief, said: ``The degree of panic going on _ this is, indeed,
clearly exacting an excessive and unfair pressure on a large number
of countries.''
</P>
<P>
   For Camdessus, that is a significant change of tone. In January,
he signed an agreement in Indonesia with President Suharto that he
declared would restore confidence _ only to see the country
dissolve into violence, economic chaos and political upheaval that
forced Suharto's resignation. Early this summer Camdessus declared
that there was no crisis in Russia, and a huge one erupted within
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few months ago people were talking about seeing the light at
the end of the tunnel,'' said Jeffrey Garten, the dean of the Yale
School of Management, a former top official in the Commerce
Department. ``Now the only hope is keeping the world economy from
total deterioration. And you get a sense that this is all now truly
left to Adam Smith's invisible hand _ it's beyond any country's
ability, any institution's ability, to control.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For their part, Rubin and Greenspan, speaking frequently by
phone and at their weekly breakfast meetings in Washington, are
choosing their words with extraordinary care. Neither, for example,
has used the phrase ``global recession'' in public. They fear that
the phrase alone might cause more selloffs and make continued
turmoil a self-fulfilling prophecy.
</P>
<P>
   But Miyazawa, speaking in Japanese at a news conference here
Friday evening, used a close equivalent to the term. And at one
point he broke into English to discuss how the failure of a major
Japanese bank, the Long Term Credit Bank of Japan, ``might result
in systemic risk for the United States and for Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Systemic risk'' is the phrase used by monetary authorities to
describe how the failure of an institution or a severe market drop
in one economy can course through the global economy, setting off
events elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   For Miyazawa, 78, the return to San Francisco to plead for
``more patience'' to deal with Japan's problems had odd historical
echoes. In 1951, as a young, English-speaking bureaucrat, Miyazawa
was a central behind-the-scenes player in the negotiation of the
peace treaty between Japan and the United States _ signed here _
that ended the American occupation of his country and set it on the
path to become an economic superpower. In the ensuing half-century,
Japan has often turned to Miyazawa, whose contacts in Washington
run deep, to deal with what the Japanese call ``gaiatsu,'' or
foreign pressure. He grew up in the Japanese finance ministry, and
assured his dinner partners Friday night _ in the presence of the
ministry's officials _ that he could deal with bureaucratic
resistance to reform of Japan's economic system.
</P>
<P>
   But he was less sanguine about his ability to get Japan's
Parliament to act quickly on financial rescue legislation. The key
dispute is whether to allow a huge infusion of taxpayer money to
the banking system to rid it of bad loans.

   WASHINGTON _ This is the sizzling book proposal that is about to
land on the desk of the New York publisher Judith Regan.
</P>
<P>
   ``HOW TO CATCH YOUR VERY OWN PRESIDENT!!!''
</P>
<P>
   By Monica Lewinsky as told to Marcia Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Preface: Powerful men who are busy running things aren't as hard
to get as you think. It's really, really easy if you show a little
gumption and a lot of cleavage.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, sometimes it's actually harder to get the attention of
the president's aides than the Big He himself! Like, at first, I
had this huge crush on George Stephanopoulos. He was such a
hottie!!! But no matter how many times I schlepped to Starbucks for
his faves, double tall lattes, George treated me like some little
intern. I tried flirting with Rahm Emanuel, too. But he was all
wrapped up in his wife and kid. Bor-ing!!!!
</P>
<P>
   I called Mom. She knows all about the operatic passions of
famous men. She scolded me for wasting my time on small fry. She
told me to dream the impossible dream!!!
</P>
<P>
   I've been on an amazing voyage of self-discovery. And now I can
share with you the secret to making any man, even the leader of the
free world, your love puppet!
</P>
<P>
   Chapter 1: Location. Location. Location.
</P>
<P>
   Even a Plain Jane or a Plump Patty can beat out Sharon Stone by
remembering one little thing: you're there and she isn't. It's the
proximity, stupid! Men are lazy. They'll grab the closest doughnut
off the platter.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think it would be hard to lurk around the Oval Office.
Surprise!! A lot of Xeroxing goes into running a superpower. No
task is too menial if it allows you to bounce past your prey!!!
</P>
<P>
   Also try this: befriend his personal secretary and cozy up to
his steward.
</P>
<P>
   Chapter 2: Guarding Your Turf.
</P>
<P>
   Beware of bureaucratic bats who want to protect the president by
transferring you across the Potomac. You must throw big hissy fits
_ and make your mother throw big hissy fits _ until you get
transferred back into his field of vision.
</P>
<P>
   Beware of other girlfriends he may have stashed around the White
House. And don't let any other intern handle the presidential
pizza.
</P>
<P>
   Chapter 3: Dressing for Success.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need an expensive dress to catch your president. The
mistake most White House girls make is trying to get something that
fits right and looks professional. You want something tight and
unprofessional!! A snug navy blue number from the Gap and stilettos
will beat a loose, elegantly tailored Calvin Klein and sensible
pumps every time. (Note: If you are called before a grand jury,
reverse that formula.)
</P>
<P>
   Chapter 4: The Care and Feeding of the Presidential Ego.
</P>
<P>
   To turn him into a panting puppy, you must be a breathless
kitten. Always act excited when he calls. Always claw your way to
the front of the rope line. Widen your eyes sympathetically when he
complains about foreign dictators, evil prosecutors and mercenary
ex-girlfriends. Don't worry if you're giving more than you're
getting in the relationship. Research his yummies: Is your

<P>
   CHICAGO _ In the final months of The Hole, anarchy was
everywhere. The Hole, the most oppressive section of Chicago's
notorious Robert Taylor Homes housing project, was coming down.
</P>
<P>
   Gang members shot at a moving van outside one of the project's
three high-rise buildings. Moving crews tried to hurry out each day
before drug dealers commandeered the elevators.
</P>
<P>
   Lenzie Jones packed his grandchildren's clothes but did not know
what to do with their mother's belongings. She had fled a few days
before, after the drug gang she hawked heroin for accused her of
stealing and beat her with a baseball bat and a two-by-four.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Smith frantically swatted cockroaches and attacked stains
in her kitchen. An inspector from the building she wanted to move
into was coming to scrutinize her housekeeping. If she failed, she
would lose the new apartment she had set her heart on.
</P>
<P>
   Katie Sistrunk still had no idea where she would go, days before
her building was to be emptied.
</P>
<P>
   On a scale not seen in decades, the federal government is
helping cities clear slums again, but this time they are slums it
helped create: public housing projects crippled by flawed policies
and mismanagement and overwhelmed by poverty and crime.
</P>
<P>
   From Hartford and Newark to Denver and San Francisco, 100,000
apartments in the nation's worst public housing projects are being
razed under a federal program called Hope VI. The plan is to
replace them with smaller developments that mix families of
different incomes, while moving thousands of tenants into privately
owned buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The Hole was torn down in July, and the Chicago Housing
Authority will eventually tear down all of Robert Taylor's 28
high-rise buildings.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, where high-rise housing projects are corrosive
landmarks of poverty and racial segregation, the demolition will be
nothing less than seismic: The city wants to raze 11,000
apartments, nearly 40 percent of its public housing for families,
over the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is the challenge greater than at Robert Taylor, much of
which is ``considered the worst slum area in the United States''
according to the Chicago Housing Authority.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge is not just for the 11,000 people who will leave
Robert Taylor, a population that is 99 percent black, so poor that
nearly half of the adults live on less than $5,000 a year, and so
isolated that many are unfamiliar with life beyond the grim
monoliths that shadow the Dan Ryan Expressway on the South Side for
nearly two miles.
</P>
<P>
   Hope VI is a test for Chicago itself, as housing officials try
to eliminate a ghetto by placing most of Robert Taylor's tenants in
private apartments. Success will require communities to accept as
neighbors people they have long been happy to have out of sight.
But already a pattern is emerging of housing project tenants being
moved mainly to poor black neighborhoods, many as rundown and
unsafe as the high-rises they left.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-six percent of Robert Taylor adult residents are
unemployed and some need assistance with basic, non-job-related
skills, such as arranging for utility services and selecting
clothes to wear to interviews with prospective landlords.
</P>
<P>
   The distance between Robert Taylor and the outside world is not
lost on the tenants. ``I guess that's why they call it The Hole,''
said Deborah Mardis, a resident for 20 years. ``You fall in and you
never get out.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to simply relocating tenants, Hope VI plans to ease
tenants off government dependence. While relocating Robert Taylor
tenants, the housing authority is spending $1.5 million of its
initial $25 million Hope VI grant on social services, trying to
place as many residents as possible in high school equivalency
courses, training programs and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The aim is to disperse the housing project's concentrated
poverty without introducing or aggravating social problems in the
tenants' new neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really need a not-in-my-back-yard backlash right
now.'' said Wanda White, the housing authority official supervising
the relocation.
</P>
<P>
   The housing authority has contracted a private relocation agency
to help find apartments for tenants, some of whom have criminal
records, drug problems or erratic rent-paying habits that could
disqualify them for new housing. The agency's employees not only
show tenants homes in a variety of neighborhoods, but also help
with things like applications, coaching for landlord interviews and
ensuring that tenants are prepared for housekeeping inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Even with such help, making the move to private-sector housing
is difficult for many tenants. Ms. Smith, 23, was desperate to get
out. She was in many ways a typical Robert Taylor tenant: a young,
single mother with three young children. She struggled on welfare,
falling behind on her $44 monthly rent.
</P>
<P>
   Like most people who lived in The Hole, she didn't want another
housing authority apartment: She wanted a federal rent subsidy
known as a Section 8 certificate, which would allow her to rent her
own apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, Hope VI officials want Section 8 subsidies and the
private market to replace 60 percent of the destroyed units.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith, who is studying for a high school equivalency
diploma, was organized and efficient in applying for a Section 8
apartment. She assembled birth certificates, Social Security cards
and her son's report card to prove he attended school.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the housekeeping inspector who assessed her as a potential
tenant was unimpressed. The inspector complained about writing on
the walls, said Ms. Smith, and about her friends, who smoked
marijuana in the hallway. Just weeks before her building was to be
emptied, she failed the inspection.
</P>
<P>
   Crestfallen and angry, she moved in with her mother. Finally, in
July, she was approved for a Section 8 apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody going to be fixing up this raggedy place when you're
fixing to move,'' she said, commenting on the initial housekeeping
inspection. ``They know this is the projects, right?''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Begun in 1959, the Robert Taylor Homes quickly became the
nation's largest government-sponsored ghetto.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969 Congress changed the public housing rent policy: Instead
of a fixed rent, tenants were to pay a percentage of their income.
</P>
<P>
   At Robert Taylor, that caused working families to move out as
their rents rose while neighbors on welfare paid almost nothing.
Housing officials, wary of discrimination suits, stopped screening
tenants.
</P>
<P>
   As the project filled with impoverished people, rent income fell
and maintenance had to be cut. As families moved out, vacant
apartments became havens for drug dealers. Violence and drugs
devastated generations.
</P>
<P>
   The legacies of that devastation have spawned one of the
toughest questions faced by housing officials: how to deal with
intensely troubled families.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Taylor has two relocation specialists to work with
families. They sort out whose name is on each lease, and therefore
who is entitled to new housing; tell tenants about problems such as
unpaid rent, and explain their options: Section 8 subsidies,
another housing project, or ``scattered site'' apartments, which
are managed by the authority but are not in a project. They also
arrange moves, pay security deposits and visit families in their
new homes.
</P>
<P>
   Lenzie Jones, 61, and his daughter, Mary Bee Christian,
presented one of the toughest situations. They were among the last
people to leave their building before it was razed, and even then
they moved to temporary housing with about 25 other families with
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Jones and his grandchildren had been living with his
drug-addicted daughter even though housing officials had separated
Ms. Christian from them in April, a month after her boyfriend hit
Jones with a crowbar to make him give up the children's welfare
money.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to qualify for a Section 8 subsidy, Jones was interviewed
by the agency that assessed tenants for the subsidies. But the
interview, on a late April day, did not go well.
</P>
<P>
   Because the apartment in The Hole had been leased in his
daughter's name, the Section 8 program could not help him until the
housing authority put his name on the lease, too. And because Ms.
Christian owed $250 in back rent, no one living there could get a
rent subsidy until the debt was paid.
</P>
<P>
   Jones left the interview bewildered by bureaucratic red tape.
</P>
<P>
   By late July, the family owed nearly $500 in rent and Jones'
welfare payments had been cut in half because he had missed an
appointment with a caseworker.
</P>
<P>
   But a housing caseworker, Brenda Hunter, said she is not giving
up on Jones, who said he would try to pay the back rent and apply
again for a Section 8 subsidy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely don't want him to get left behind,'' Hunter
said.
</P>
<P>
   Katie Sistrunk, 45, determined that she would not be one of
those left behind. Like many Robert Taylor families, the Sistrunk
family _ Katie, her 13 children and 28 grandchildren _ has some
members who have succeeded against bleak odds and others whose
criminal behavior could result in eviction under public housing
rules, or could prevent them from getting private housing.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sistrunk became a passionate advocate for herself and her
extended family when the private agency screening people for the
apartment she wanted rejected her, in part because they had
confused her with a sister who had been arrested on drug charges.
</P>
<P>
   During 27 years in The Hole, the Sistrunks have made undeniable
strides. They relied little on welfare, living mostly on income
from Ms. Sistrunk's former husband. In the middle of squalor, the
children ironed their jeans and T-shirts. Three children have
attended college. But five of Ms. Sistrunk's grown children have
criminal records, court documents show.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ms. Sistrunk lobbied housing officials until six of her
grown children got rent-subsidized apartments. For herself and her
two youngest children, she wanted one of the housing authority's
new scattered-site apartments. She rejected one. Twice she accepted
homes but was told they had been taken.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Ms. Sistrunk was guaranteed a place that she wanted,
saving her from moving to temporary quarters.
</P>
<P>
   In June, she moved out, carrying an urn with the ashes of her
former husband, who died in March; salt for good luck; and her
daughter's prom glass, a proud symbol of her high school
graduation.
</P>
<P>
   She passed a drug dealer who was yelling ``Bubble on State,''
signaling that the police were nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so sick of that `Bubble on State,''' she whispered.
``What they should have did is torn it down many years ago and
saved a lot of mothers' sons.''

RUSSIANS RUMMAGE FOR THEIR SAVINGS IN CHAOS OF BANKING SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ With a bitter wind biting at his cheeks on this
unusually cold but clear Saturday morning, Yevgeny Ushakov arrived
at his local bank branch to find the doors closed.
</P>
<P>
   While a city holiday was the official reason the bank was not
open, Ushakov and others unable to enter believed that was merely
an excuse for banks to avoid long lines of anxious depositors that
have been snaking in front of branches all over the city during the
last week.
</P>
<P>
   As the ruble continues to crumble and increasing numbers of
insolvent banks are brought under state control, untold numbers of
Russians are left with the unenviable choice of leaving their
savings in barren banks or allowing the accounts to be transferred
to a state-owned bank at a fraction of their value.
</P>
<P>
   Withdrawing the money is almost impossible, but people still
try.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put my money in three different banks because I thought it
might at least be safe in two of the three,'' said Ushakov, a
66-year-old who had lived on the interest from $4,000 in savings
and a monthly pension now worth a third of the $150 it was worth a
month ago. ``They say don't put all of your eggs in one basket. I
didn't think all three would fail.''
</P>
<P>
   Depositors were given some hope late in the week when the
government, its own future still unclear, promised that it would
salvage citizens' savings from the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, however, Russians learned that the government
guarantee carried a stiff price. If depositors choose to have their
savings transferred to Sberbank, the state-owned savings bank, they
cannot withdraw money until mid-November.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting so long is likely to eat even further into the value of
the average Russian's savings because the ruble, which was valued
at about 6 to the dollar in mid-August, has now fallen to between
16 and 21 to the dollar, depending on where it is exchanged. And
the ruble is likely to fall even further if the government remains
paralyzed and the economy continues its downward spiral.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the misery, the government told Russians with savings
denominated in dollars that the value of their accounts will be
pegged at 9.3 rubles to the dollar, far below what dollars attract
on the street. Depositors have until Sept. 26 to decide if they
want their accounts transferred to Sberbank.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the government's savings bailout drew angry reactions
in Moscow and St. Petersburg on Thursday and Friday, as throngs of
Russians clogged the doorways of six banks that are candidates for
savings transfers: Inkombank, Menatep, Mosbiznesbank, MOST-Bank,
Promstroibank and SBS-Agro.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in response to the outcry, Acting Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin said in a television interview Thursday that ``losses
are inevitable'' on the savings accounts but ``if the gap is too
big, we will have to solve this problem as well. We have no other
way out.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Chernomyrdin defended a broader plan of pumping
fresh funds into the economy before the government launches a
stricter austerity program. A Russian Central Bank spokesman said
Friday that it considered the terms of the savings transfer to be
fair and that depositors who did not participate would have to fend
for themselves.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``That's their problem,'' said the spokesman, Leonid Nitko.
``They have to settle with their banks directly. If they don't want
to transfer, they forfeit their rights immediately to transfer to
Sberbank later.''
</P>
<P>
   Ushakov had a different view of the government's transfer plan.
``How can they say they're treating us fairly?'' he asked. ``I
deposited money to get interest. Now I can't have my money or my
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Although much of the anger in the last week has been directed at
the government, the state is hardly the only institution
responsible for the banking mess. Russian banks were central
players in a speculative whirlwind that spread over recent years as
the free market was touted as the newest solution to centuries of
economic hardship.
</P>
<P>
   Many banks, such as Most-Bank, where Ushakov keeps his savings,
took the deposits of Russians completely unfamiliar with uninsured
retail banking and funneled the money into risky securities or used
it to help finance the takeover of sagging industrial companies.
When the securities market crashed and the economy collapsed, those
investments took the banks, and the savings of average Russians,
down with them.
</P>
<P>
   Few Russians seem to hold bank management responsible for their
losses. They are used to identifying the state rather than a
private sector as the author of their woes. And the Central Bank,
which has never been a strict regulator of the banks, said it had
no intention of holding management accountable.
</P>
<P>
   Although the loss of savings only compounds other hardships,
including rapidly escalating prices and dwindling supplies of food,
there is some relief in that most Russians have never put much
faith in banks.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Russia's 147 million people keep their savings at home,
or ship money abroad if they can. About 80 percent of the $21
billion that is kept in banks is already tucked away in Sberbank
accounts. Even so, that means that $4.2 billion in Russian savings
is now up for grabs, and those depositors are not happy.
</P>
<P>
   Many were well aware that the banks were troubled, there were
stiff penalties for withdrawing deposits slated to stay in banks
for at least one year _ interest rates of two percent rather than
17 percent, for example. And a year ago, the outlook for banks did
not look as bleak.
</P>
<P>
   Yevgenia Serebryakova, a 61 year-old pensioner, said she was not
aware of how horribly the banking system had crashed until she
returned on August 14 from a vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I was shocked, because I had put all of my money in
there,'' she said, gesturing toward her Most-Bank branch. ``I asked
them if they were a strong bank and they said, `Yeah, no
problems.'''
</P>
<P>
   The banking system's meltdown may cause an entire generation of
younger Russians to distrust any bank. Alexander German, a
39-year-old information technology manager for a Western
corporation, said the outlook for his job and his faith in Russia's
banking system is uncertain, although he has hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm optimistic but it depends on the political situation and
doesn't depend on the economy anymore,'' he said. ``There could be
a civil war or stabilization. No one knows.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Ushakov said he is too old to wait and see if the
banking system can be reformed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister always got money on her birthday and put the money
in her sock,'' he said. ``Now she's the richest one of all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   So will he be transferring his money to Sberbank?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said. ``Into my sock.''

SPORTS COLUMN: FOR AARON, THERE WAS A DREADED DIFFERENCE  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   He had 713 homers and Henry Aaron's season was over, but his
worry wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   While chasing Babe Ruth's record of 714 homers, the Atlanta
Braves' slugger had been haunted by racist threats in some of the
hundreds of letters he received daily. Now, with six months to wait
before he could tie and break the record in 1974, he was asked
about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't go into hibernation now,'' he said. ``I can't hide.
I've said that all I have to do to break Babe Ruth's record is to
stay alive, but I've got to live my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Stay alive. For a healthy slugger who would be 40 years old on
Feb. 5, 1974, that wouldn't seem to be a problem. But he remembered
the anonymous hateful racist letters that threatened his life when
he approached or broke the Babe's record.
</P>
<P>
   Those threatening letters, which were turned over to the FBI,
prompted Aaron to hire a bodyguard, an Atlanta policeman who
carried a loaded .38 revolver.
</P>
<P>
   And in Aaron's home-run chase, those threatening letters created
a dreaded difference from the concerns that confront Mark McGwire
and Sammy Sosa now and that affected Roger Maris in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire and Sosa have had to contend only with each other and
the swarming news media, although the Cardinal slugger is also
surrounded by the daily debate over his use of androstenedione.
</P>
<P>
   Maris had to contend only with Babe Ruth's ghost and the
asterisk that was attached to his eventual total of 61 homers.
</P>
<P>
   But less than six years after Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., had
been assassinated, Aaron had to worry about a faceless somebody out
there who didn't like the idea of a black man breaking a white
man's record.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron's countdown had begun after his 712th homer in Houston on
a Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   When the Braves returned to Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium for
the season's final week, about 15 out-of-town sportswriters
arrived. Before a game Aaron talked to them for about an hour at
his locker in more of a casual conversation than an interrogation.
Finally he grabbed two or three bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me go hit,'' he would say, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   After a game he conducted a formal interview in a separate room
to accommodate another dozen cameras and microphones. But when two
midweek games with the Los Angeles Dodgers attracted only 10,211
and 5,711 customers, he professed not to be insulted by Atlanta's
indifference to him and to history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a job to do,'' he said. ``It doesn't make any
difference to me if there are 750 people watching or 75,000.''
</P>
<P>
   On the weekend, Atlanta awakened. Saturday night 17,836 showed
up and he responded with his 713th homer, off Jerry Reuss, a
Houston Astros left-hander. His ovation lasted so long, he hopped
out of the dugout for a rare curtain call. In Sunday's finale,
before 40,517, he smacked three singles, raising his average to
.301, and when he trotted to left field in the ninth inning, he got
a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That ovation was tremendous,'' he said. ``That ovation was
really great.''
</P>
<P>
   He knew now that Atlanta appreciated him, but he knew there were
others out there who didn't. He also knew that he had to ``stay
alive,'' that he had ``to live his life'' until the Braves opened
the 1974 season with three games in Cincinnati before returning to
Atlanta where the Braves hoped to assure that he would tie and
break the record.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the Braves' owner, Bill Bartholomay, announced that
Aaron ``will be available as a pinch-hitter for the games in
Cincinnati and for part-time play if required.'' Stirred by news
media protests over the Braves' disregard for the integrity of
their lineup, Commissioner Bowie Kuhn expected Aaron to start at
least two of the three games.
</P>
<P>
   Before the season opener in Cincinnati on April 4, the sixth
anniversary of King's assassination, Aaron asked the Reds to
observe a moment of silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, they found that their schedule wouldn't
permit it,'' he said later. ``They already had the program all set.
But it would've been appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   On his first swing against right-hander Jack Billingham in the
first inning, Aaron hit his 714th homer over the left-center field
wall in Riverfront Stadium, tying the Babe's record. Friday was an
off day, but on Saturday the Braves' manager, Eddie Mathews, didn't
write Aaron's name into the lineup. The Braves lost, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night Kuhn phoned Mathews with a ``direct order'' to
start Aaron in Sunday's game or face ``serious penalties.'' Aaron
struck out twice and grounded out.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the possibility of the 715th homer, the Braves' home
opener on Monday night drew 53,775, a record. After walking in his
first at-bat, Aaron, on his first swing against left-hander Al
Downing, smashed a fastball over the left-centerfield fence near
the 385-foot sign. It was caught in the Braves bullpen by pitcher
Tom House.
</P>
<P>
   As the number ``715'' flashed on the scoreboard, fireworks
exploded and two young men raced onto the field to accompany Aaron
around the bases. In the stands, Aaron's bodyguard, as he would say
later, clutched his revolver but didn't draw it.
</P>
<P>
   By now, the Braves, having rushed out of their dugout, were
around home plate as House and the others in the bullpen hurried
there to join in the celebration that would last 11 minutes. From
the Aaron family's special section, his father, Herbert Sr., hopped
onto the field. So did his mother, Estella, who embraced him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never knew,'' the man who broke Babe Ruth's record would say
later, ``my mother could hug so tight.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Aaron, who finished his career with the Milwaukee Brewers,
would hit a total of 755 homers. And some of those homers were hit
with a dreaded difference from what now hangs over Mark McGwire and
Sammy Sosa in their chase.

<P>
   KERAK, Jordan _ King Hussein has reigned for 45 years, more than
twice as long as Ahmed Thneibat has been alive. But now the king is
undergoing cancer treatment for the second time in six years, and
Thneibat and other Jordanians are apprehensive about what is to
come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rest assured, I am not over and done with yet,'' said the
king, 62, in a televised address to his people from the Mayo Clinic
in Minnesota in July. But he also left the impression that he is
determined to prepare the country for the prospect that he might
not return, saying in the same speech, ``There is life and there is
an end to life, and that is the way with everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Few in Jordan doubt that power would pass to Crown Prince
Hassan, the king's younger brother and closest adviser, who has
been the designated heir to the throne for more than three decades.
He has been regent in the king's absence, which is expected to last
at least until November.
</P>
<P>
   But many Jordanians and foreign observers say they wonder
whether a King Hassan could prove as successful as King Hussein in
guiding Jordan through the kinds of storms that have been a main
feature of the country's recent history.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are worried; they think there could be trouble,'' said
Thneibat, 18, who like all but a minority in this close-knit
country of 4 million has known no king but Hussein, who took power
in 1953 at age 17.
</P>
<P>
   Kerak, a southern city crowned by a Crusader fortress, has long
been a base of support for Jordan's monarchy. But riots broke out
here two years ago over an increase in the price of bread, a
reminder that loyalty has limits. Now the public mood is again
turning volatile, a result of a crippling water crisis, severe
economic problems and rising disillusionment over peace with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Over tea and hummus in a simple cafe adorned with
black-and-white portraits of the country's current and former
kings, Thneibat spoke for many in saying he hoped that a King
Hassan might prove more vigorous than his brother in addressing the
economy. But as he and other Jordanians try to conceive of a new
era, a bigger question may be whether a King Hassan would inherit
his brother's capacity to chart his own course, even when it means
forging ahead of public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a minefield, and he doesn't have what it takes to cross
it safely,'' Labib Kamhawi, a prominent human rights campaigner,
said, spelling out one view. ``He doesn't have the charisma the
king had. He doesn't have the broad base of support. And he would
take power at a time when the power of the Hashemite dynasty is at
a very low ebb.''
</P>
<P>
   People close to Hassan say he shares Hussein's deep commitment
to Jordan's peace with Israel, though it has borne little fruit and
has little domestic support. That assessment is shared by most
foreign analysts, who say they are confident that the departure of
King Hussein would not cause Jordan to back away from promoting a
broader settlement of Arab-Israeli disputes.
</P>
<P>
   But diplomats do say that Hassan, as king, may have less
latitude to promote the peace than his brother, in part because
hostility toward Israel has deepened among Jordanians, and in part
because the crown prince has rarely displayed his brother's
magnanimous style.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still a great deal of uncertainty about the crown
prince,'' a Western diplomat said. ``He's not his brother. He
doesn't have a common touch, and he gets his information from
briefing papers whereas the king gets his information from the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The prince has declined interview requests during the king's
illness and has played the role of caretaker, not addressing the
doubts about him. But in what may have been an attempt to defuse
some criticism, he did convene an unusual meeting in late August
that included leaders from all of Jordan's political parties,
including Islamists who form the main opposition bloc.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of a Jordanian leader with untested domestic
prestige is particularly worrying to Israelis, who are nervous
about Yasser Arafat's pledge to declare an independent Palestinian
state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip next May, when the Middle
East peace plan begun by the Oslo accords is supposed to be
completed.
</P>
<P>
   At 51, Prince Hassan is nearly 12 years younger than the king,
who will turn 63 on Nov. 14. Hassan was 6 when Hussein took power
on May 2, 1953, succeeding his grandfather, King Abdullah _ who had
been assassinated in Jerusalem in 1951 as Hussein stood at his side
_ and his father, King Talal, who stepped down in favor of his son
after less than a year in power.
</P>
<P>
   Since his 18th birthday in 1965, Prince Hassan has been the
country's designated No. 2, and he is described in an official
biography as having ``constantly served as King Hussein's closest
political adviser, deputy and confidant, as well as regent in his
absence.''
</P>
<P>
   He earned a degree in Oriental studies from Christ Church
College, Oxford University, and has worked tirelessly within Jordan
to promote scientific study and better integration of the region's
economy. He took part in the negotiations that led to Jordan's
peace agreement with Israel, met with Benjamin Netanyahu even
before Netanyahu was elected Israel's prime minister, and has close
ties to most Arab leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he has always seemed in many ways the king's alter ego,
more comfortable in a tie and blue blazer than an Arab headdress,
and more disposed toward academic-style oratory than toward the
emotional eloquence of his older brother.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his admirers say that he could not have been expected to
show more color as crown prince; his mission, they say, has been to
stay in the background. ``He's been in the shadow of a very
important historic figure, so it will be prudent to judge him only
after he takes center stage,'' said Mustafa Hamarneh, director of
the Center for Strategic Studies at the University of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   But in listing the qualities that have made the king such a
dominant figure, most other analysts give prominence to some that
are not readily transferable.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of Jordanians would side with the king even if
they think he is wrong,'' said Fahed Fanek, an economist who is one
of Jordan's most popular newspaper columnists. ``Ninety percent of
the population of Jordan was born after the king took power. They
know that he was indispensable in leading the country to safety. So
even if they think he was wrong, they give him the benefit of the
doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   After renal cancer in 1992 and a prostate operation in 1997, the
king was found to have lymphoma this summer after nearly a year in
which he had been suffering from inexplicable fevers. A statement
issued by the Mayo Clinic said that the disease is ``highly
treatable with chemotherapy,'' which the king began in July, but it
also mentioned a need for plenty of rest.
</P>
<P>
   So far the king has displayed a vigorous public face, even
flying his own jet to Washington after completing the first and
second of six scheduled rounds of chemotherapy. On the first of
those trips, he and his wife, Queen Noor, dined privately on a
White House balcony with the Clintons, and even now, two months
into what is expected to be at least four months of treatment,
Jordanian officials say that he consults by telephone with Prince
Hassan at least once a day.
</P>
<P>
   It was the king, Jordanian officials say, who assumed the
leading role in orchestrating a change of government in August,
replacing a team tarred by evidence that its mismanagement was to
blame for a water crisis so severe that Saudi Arabia and Syria sent
emergency stocks to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   And even while recuperating at his private home in Washington,
he has met with the new government, led by Fayez Tarawneh, a former
ambassador to the United States and foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   In the months ahead, Jordanian officials expect the country's
affairs to be administered along a kind of triangle between Amman,
Washington, and the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. But people
familiar with the king's health say that his resistance to disease
has been weakened by the chemotherapy and that it is likely to
diminish further as the treatment progresses.

SPORTS COLUMN: RECALLING MARIS  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT LIPSYTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roger Maris was not a subtle man but he might have appreciated
some of the nuances of the current home run derby, particularly the
controversy over Mark McGwire's use of testosterone-boosting pills
and the second-banana status of Sammy Sosa. As a decent man, Maris
would not have wished the Curse of the Bambino on the next home run
king, although he would have appreciated having it finally lifted
from his own crew-cut head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I often wonder what my baseball career would have been had I
not hit the 61,'' Maris said in 1984, a year before he died.
``Because after that point, it was no fun anymore. It's not even
fun to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked him why he was talking about it.
</P>
<P>
   Thoughtful, earnest, he nodded and said: ``You know, there's
going to be other kids who will go into the game like I went into
the game, thinking you're going to get credit for what you do. I
think a lot of times how much nicer things could have been if I got
a fair shake. But this is the real side, and there's a lot of kids
that can learn from this. You got to have a tough skin if you want
to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   The villain in his story was ``the media,'' which made him ``a
whipping boy,'' for not being Mickey Mantle. Like Sosa, Maris was
swinging in the shadow of a designated hero. Mantle, only three
years older than Maris but by then a Yankee for 10 years, was
supposed to finally fulfill his promise as heir to Babe Ruth and
Joe DiMaggio. Maris, who had been touted as ``a future Mickey
Mantle'' when he came up with Cleveland in 1957, became a Yankee
three years later.
</P>
<P>
   In the glorious 1960 season, he hit 39 homers to Mantle's
league-leading 40 and was voted most valuable player as the
so-called M&AMP;M boys led the Yankees to the pennant. In those days,
fans booed Mantle and cheered Maris, who thought life could only
get better. And it did, at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, '61 was an easy season,'' Maris said. ``It was fun.
It was exciting. How could it not be?'' At 26, Maris was a complete
ballplayer and a cooperative if colorless interviewee. He just
wasn't as glamorous as the country-slick Mantle, whose mean streak
and unprofessional life style were rarely acknowledged by a press
pack that was intimidated by him and had a crush on him.
</P>
<P>
   The writers dismissed Maris as ``unworthy'' of wearing the
``Ruthian'' crown. Commissioner Ford Frick, a former sportswriter
who had been the Babe's chief ghost, announced that any record
broken beyond the 154 games of Ruth's schedule would bear a
notation.
</P>
<P>
   Was he protecting his own legacy as well as Ruth's? Whatever the
reason, Maris wore the so-called asterisk like a scarlet letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bitters me up,'' he said 23 years later.
</P>
<P>
   In a sport that has seen so many performance-enhancing and
diminishing changes, including movable outfield walls, night games,
jet travel, expansion, improved bats and balls, not to mention such
chemical advances as androstenedione, the asterisk seems silly. One
could as easily be affixed to McGwire's final number.
</P>
<P>
   By 1962, Maris' career was joyless. He hated the winter banquet
circuit that took him away from his wife and children, and he began
responding sourly to ``rips'' in print. He was steaming from such
criticism when he blew off a spring training interview with Jimmy
Cannon. The dyspeptic columnist then wrote that Maris was ``a
whiner'' and implied, incorrectly, that even Mantle was now
disgusted with him.
</P>
<P>
   This gave permission to writers around the league to vent their
anti-Maris or anti-Yankee or anti-superstar rage, which, said
Maris, ``spread like the old cancer.'' Fans punctuated the stories
by throwing chairs, nuts and bolts, empty bottles at the
outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It drove me into something of a shell,'' Maris said. ``I just
didn't enjoy being at the ballpark like I did. It was very
difficult every day to say, `Well, here we go again.' I mean, it
was almost like going into a snake pit. It's sort of interesting
though, with the reputation the media gave me over the years,
people are afraid of me before they meet me. They walk on eggs
around me. And then, after awhile, they say, `I just can't believe
you're anything like you are.' And that's gratifying.''
</P>
<P>
   This was at his beer distributorship in Gainesville, Fla., over
several days of interviewing for the CBS Sunday morning show with
Charles Kuralt. While he told the producer Kathy Sulkes and me that
his lymphatic cancer was in remission and that his prognosis was
hopeful, there was the sense that he wanted to set the record
straight while he could. The Maris of those days was affable and
wry, obviously happy in the cocoon of a warm family.
</P>
<P>
   Maris' office walls were a reflection of his nostalgic
priorities. All the baseball photographs, including the famous shot
of the 61st swing, were behind his back, visible to visitors. He
faced his future, pictures of him swinging a golf club with family
members, customers, old Yankees, politicians. It was not a long
future; he was 51 when he died. Roger the whiner had waited five
years before sharing his symptoms with a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the people who treated him shabbily are gone, but so are
many of the people who might be motivated to make amends. That
Roger Maris belongs in baseball's Hall of Fame is too obvious to
belabor. This season's carnival proves that breaking the record _
and it is still Babe Ruth's record in most minds _ is qualification
enough, no matter the rest of a player's statistics.
</P>
<P>
   What a good time to give a decent man credit and a fair shake.

SPORTS COLUMN: PROTECTING BALL SPECULATORS FROM THEMSELVES  
 (JT )
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ On this long and steamy Labor Day Weekend, Major
League Baseball is on a double mission, protecting the world from
two separate rampaging hordes.
</P>
<P>
   The first horde consists of reporters in soggy t-shirts and
baggy shorts, with Mark McGwire quote lust on their faces. The
second horde consists of beer-ingesting fans, eager to grapple in
the violent scrum for the ball that could make all the difference
in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   But first, they must live to tell the tale. That is why dozens
of baseball's special agents are poised for duty, just waiting for
the sacred clout.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire went into Saturday's game _ in brutal heading-for-97
weather _ seeking the home run that would tie Babe Ruth's old
record of 60. Then he would take dead aim at Roger Maris' record of
61 and then the record-breaking blast.
</P>
<P>
   Some of us were hoping the big basher would hit three on Friday
night and get us out of here, but he let us down, going 0-for-3.
</P>
<P>
   Now it became a vigil, not only for McGwire but also for the
fans who have procured seats in McGwire's home-run alley,
particularly from the left-field foul pole toward right-center.
These fans have a ticket for a wonderful souvenir or a big pay day
_ or personal injury.
</P>
<P>
   The value of the No. 62 home run has been estimated at $100,000,
although one anonymous voice claims he will pay 10 times that. We
shall see. The value of the ball could fluctuate like some
electronics stock in legalized gambling, that is to say, the stock
market. What happens to the 62nd ball if McGwire and Sammy Sosa
both go on to 63, 64, 65 homers?
</P>
<P>
   Fans might ask if they want to risk death or disfigurement for
the 62nd home-run ball, particularly if its value should ``correct
itself,'' as they say on Wall Street. (``Correction'' sounds like
``You just lost a bundle, my man,'' at least to my unsophisticated
ear.)
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, fans will see dollar signs on the 62nd home-run
ball as it soars into some distant grandstand, but the fans must be
protected from themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Security comes in many forms. The baseball home office in New
York and the Cardinals' management have put up metal barricades
around the field during batting practice, to keep the assembled
news media in its place. Baseball distributed 700 credentials for
this weekend, surely a record for a regular-season game between two
teams under .500, and only 300 credentials behind the annual
October infestation of sportswriters for the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The press was lured off guard by promises of a McGwire press
conference before Friday night's game. In docile swarms, we herded
into a sweltering and gloomy cave under the stadium, sat through
four other conferences, only to be told _ oh, by the way _ McGwire
was not coming, after all. This was not Major League Baseball's
fault. The big boy had put one over on us. Good for him.
</P>
<P>
   The more serious security note involves the fans in the outfield
seats. This is, rather literally, a matter of life and death. There
are thousands of fans in McGwire territory, many of them children,
all of them in jeopardy of the home-run-ball-from-hell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw in some games that a lot of big men who had been
drinking heavily were running after the ball,'' said a baseball
official.
</P>
<P>
   This is considered normal behavior in my part of the world, that
is to say, Noo Yawk, Noo Yawk. But in nice parts of the world like
St. Louis, the average innocent fan may be unprepared for a couple
of hundred alcohol-fueled louts, willing to dive headfirst into the
pile, like linebackers on 'roid rage (or is that redundant?)
</P>
<P>
   To keep the McGwire chase from becoming Lord of the Flies Meets
World's Toughest Man Bar Fight, baseball has organized a tactical
response. The first step is to bar everybody from home-run country
unless they have a ticket. Reporters, with our special 59-62
credentials, are not allowed to infiltrate the hallowed sections.
</P>
<P>
   While fans will be protected from the mobs in foul territory and
other alien sites, it could still come down to father vs. son,
brother vs. brother, truck driver vs. little old lady. It could get
ugly.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal management has beefed up the security guards and ushers
in the outfield _ no numbers given _ and Major League Baseball has
imported approximately 20 so-called agents, security people on the
payroll around the country, along with approximately 30 local
special hires, all in plainclothes, but with identifying badges.
</P>
<P>
   As the big home run heads toward the stands, these officers,
guards, ushers and agents will rush to the scene, presumably to
pull bodies off the top of the pile.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever is happening underneath the pile is another story.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to allow somebody to take the ball from
somebody else,'' the baseball official said.
</P>
<P>
   That sounds nice, in theory. Eventually, they will pry off
enough bodies to uncover the lucky fan. If he or she is still
breathing, the assorted officers, guards, ushers and agents will
escort that fan either to the nearest hospital or to a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, Internal Revenue Service agents will also be on hand,
taking down Social Security numbers.
</P>
<P>
   This being the litigious '90s, one can only assume that a mighty
phalanx of personal-injury lawyers will be screeching into downtown
St. Louis from their suburban palaces.
</P>
<P>
   The safest scenario for all concerned would be for the ultimate
home run to hit the foul-pole or clang off a distant facade and
come bouncing back on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe McGwire would hit an inside-the-park home run for No.
62, a 265-pound moose lumbering around the bases in pursuit of
immortality, or possibly heat stroke.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, the opposing fielder does not get to keep the ball
or barter it for a few McGwire mementos. In fact, the ball belongs
to Major League Baseball. The home-run-ball market would then
suffer a major ``correction,'' but at least nobody would die from a
home run.

IT'S KANELL'S TEAM NOW AS GIANTS DEFEND CONFERENCE TITLE  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let it be known that Danny Kanell, the 24-year-old son of a
Florida physician, the easy-smiling, Bible-school attending
quarterback who still lives at home with his parents, is not to be
trusted.
</P>
<P>
   When he played checkers with his grandmother as a kid, he would
cheat.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's true,'' Kanell said of his grandma-distracting,
checker-stealing shenanigans. ``I wanted to win that bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Let it be known that Kanell, whom no Giant has ever admitted to
seeing angry, who takes a nap almost every day, whose favorite
movie is ``Hoosiers'' and whose favorite ice cream is rainbow
sherbet, is a trash-talker on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I like that,'' he said. ``I was coming through the
tunnel at halftime during a preseason game last month and a guy on
the other team said: `That one ball you threw near me, I should
have intercepted it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kanell responded: ``Like you can catch.''
</P>
<P>
   Let it be known that Kanell, who when thrown into his first
professional huddle as an emergency replacement two years ago
entered with a goofy smile and a joke _ ``Why's it so quiet in
here, guys?'' _ and who has never lost consecutive games as a
starter, not in high school, college or the pros, isn't the least
bit worried about his future.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my team,'' he said recently. ``I have all the
confidence in the world in myself.''
</P>
<P>
   What then, does he say to people who want to know if Danny
Kanell _ the grinning, innocent-acting, third-year pro _ is indeed
the answer to the Giants quarterback miseries?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll show you the answer on the field,'' he said. ``That's my
answer.''
</P>
<P>
   And he smiled quickly, in case that sounded too confrontational.
But don't be disarmed. Ask grandma. Kanell isn't to be trusted in
competition.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants will tell you that Kanell, who in relief of the
woebegone Dave Brown last season was 7-2-1 as a starter, never
curses, never berates his linemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys who play with him don't hear him scream and holler
but they know when he feels the game is turning, when the level of
intensity has to go up,'' coach Jim Fassel said of Kanell.
</P>
<P>
   Center Lance Scott calls Kanell ``an encourager not a yeller.''
But Scott said: ``I saw him get dinged once. He got to his feet all
fired up. He was saying: `Yeah, let's go.' That's a football
player's response.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. It could just be a Kanell family response.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad taught me a long time ago to never show my emotions,''
Kanell said. ``I think he's right. The people on your team will
believe you're still thinking, still focused, still in control. The
people on the other team won't know what to think. And that's what
you want.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanell, in fact, didn't play football until he was 16. He was a
baseball player first, his father the orthopedic surgeon not
thinking it wise to subject his only son _ even if he was a big,
athletic son _ to the collisions of midget or junior high school
football.
</P>
<P>
   Kanell was good enough in baseball to be drafted by the
Milwaukee Brewers in 1992 and the Yankees in 1995. But as a junior
at Westminster Academy in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., when Kanell led
Westminster to a state title in his first season, he started to
emerge as the quarterback who played baseball, not the baseball
player who was a quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like talking about myself,'' Kanell said last week.
``But all my life, I've been someone who leads in sports, whatever
the team. I'm very comfortable in that role.''
</P>
<P>
   The winning kept coming at Florida State, so much so that Kanell
thought seriously for the first time of a career as a pro
quarterback. He was disappointed when he wasn't drafted until the
fourth round in 1996, but realized he'd have to wait to prove
people wrong.
</P>
<P>
   As a rookie with the Giants, he made friends with Brown quickly,
staying in the background as he learned the game. During his second
season, it was comical to see the look of mystification on Kanell's
face when reporters would ask him if he was bridging the gap in
ability or skill between himself and Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't my job then,'' he said last week, looking back on
the 1997 season. ``But I felt sure I could do it.''
</P>
<P>
   During the sixth game of the 1997 season, Brown left the lineup
with a strained chest muscle. Kanell led the Giants to a 20-17
upset of the Cowboys and then seven more victories and the team's
first National Football Conference East title in seven years.
</P>
<P>
   There was one hiccup along the way. After two subpar games,
Fassel publicly questioned some of Kanell's work habits. The coach
said he wanted Kanell to study more film, to practice with more
concentration, to exhibit a commitment that would give the team
confidence in him, and ultimately in themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did that to get a question answered about Danny,'' Fassel
said Friday. ``Under that kind of pressure, would he point the
finger at other people? Would he wilt? I wanted that question
answered.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel got his answer when he came to Giants Stadium the next
day _ a day off for players _ and found Kanell alone in the meeting
room watching film.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel, who has a 24-year-old son, understood.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to do right,'' Fassel said. ``Most of us do.
Sometimes you have to be challenged to see it. He knew the right
response when he was challenged.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all questions about Kanell, whose new $9.5 million,
three-year contract makes him the quarterback of the immediate
future, have been answered. There is still talk that his arm isn't
strong enough _ talk that his receivers and Fassel dispute. He
hasn't proved his durability. Last season, Kanell completed only
53.1 percent of his passes, ranking 23d among starters. And he had
an uneven preseason this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not satisfied,'' he said. ``All my goals are set high.
When I'm done playing, I'd like people in this community to think
of me the way people in Denver think of John Elway or people in
south Florida think of Dan Marino. Those guys mean a lot to their
towns. The people there are proud of them. Who knows if that's even
possible here. But I'm shooting high.''
</P>
<P>
   Danny Kanell, if asked, would also tell you not to bet against
him. Remember, he cheats. &QL;

LACK OF TRUST CREATES A GREAT DIVIDE IN NORTHWEST STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn.) (js) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Northwest Airlines says that the only issue in the week-old
strike by its 6,200 pilots is pay. The pilots counter that job
security and money are the two big hurdles standing in the way of a
settlement. But the real issue that has divided the two sides _
leading to the longest airline strike since maintenance workers
shut down Eastern Airlines in 1989 _ seems to be trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though there are some significant issues between them,''
said Kit Darby, a longtime United Airlines pilot who is also
president of Air Inc., a company that helps place commercial pilots
in jobs, ``they are not significant enough to cause a strike. The
two sides really don't trust each other. And in an atmosphere of
total distrust, you really can't sell anything.''
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to break the deadlock, a federal mediator brought
Northwest and representatives of the Airline Pilots Association
together for a meeting Saturday in Chicago to explore whether there
was enough movement on either side to make returning to the
bargaining table worthwhile. Neither side appeared to give any
ground before the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots walked out last Saturday after two years of
negotiations with the airline. Even before the strike, the two
sides were trading barbs in a nasty public relations battle that
has since intensified.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict dates back to 1993, when Northwest was near ruin.
Four years earlier, Alfred Checchi and Gary Wilson, former
executives at Marriott Corp., bought the airline in one of the last
leveraged buyouts of the 1980s. They each invested $10 million and
borrowed $3.1 billion more to buy the airline, which was founded in
1926 and had become a venerable Minnesota institution. They were
soon swamped by one of the worst downturns in commercial airline
history, making it difficult for Northwest to pay off its huge
debt.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Minnesota pitched in with some loans in 1991, but
Northwest only averted bankruptcy in 1993 after its three biggest
unions, led by the pilots, agreed to nearly $900 million in wage
concessions in return for stock and three seats on the company's
board.
</P>
<P>
   Both Northwest and the unions say the concessions ushered in a
new era of comity at the carrier. Airline traffic began to pick up
the next year, and Northwest turned around, posting record profits
in 1994 and 1995. The carrier also became top-rated for service and
on-time arrivals, a measure of the high morale of its employees.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1996, the three-year wage concessions ended. The unions
thought they were owed a 3 percent raise, according to a clause in
the 1993 agreement that linked the raise to comparable pay at four
Northwest competitors. But the company disagreed. The dispute went
to arbitration, dragging on for nine months before the unions
finally won. Still, the employees felt betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That broke the partnership bond,'' said Paul Omodt, a
spokesman for the pilots. ``You can track the decline in morale and
service back to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hirst, Northwest's chief labor negotiator, said the
clause was meant to ensure that the wages of Northwest workers were
at parity with their peers at other airlines. But the way it was
written only counted increases at rival carriers, not decreases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a legitimate issue,'' he added. ``We weren't playing
games with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirst thinks the breakdown in relations with the pilots began in
early 1996 _ before the raise became an issue _ when a new group of
union leaders took over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they have been following a strike strategy all
along,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As negotiations dragged on for two years, the boom in the
airline industry only became bigger. Northwest had record years in
1996 and 1997 and earned nearly $600 million last year. At the same
time, pilots at other airlines negotiated substantial raises.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling the anger of the pilots and of other unions at
Northwest, who are also negotiating new contracts, have been the
giant profits made by Northwest executives and directors.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Wilson, who is chairman, sold 300,000 shares
worth $15.2 million. John Dasburg, the carrier's chief executive,
cashed in stock options worth $19 million. Checchi, who resigned as
co-chairman of the airline last year to run for governor of
California, and Wilson each still own 11.4 million Northwest
shares, which are worth $302 million at the company's current share
price, which is down 60 percent from its high in March.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots are seeking a 14 percent raise over three years, a
lump-sum payment of $86 million and the elimination of a two-tier
wage scale that pays younger pilots a lower salary until the end of
their fifth year.
</P>
<P>
   The union also wants to limit the number of smaller, regional
jets the company can buy to 66 because it fears that Northwest will
transfer more flying time to the pilots of those planes, who earn
less. Northwest's 6,200 pilots make an average of $120,000 a year,
according to the union, but the company puts the number at
$133,000.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest has offered a 9 percent raise over four years, a
lump-sum payment of $57 million, profit sharing and a reduction of
the two-tier wage scale to three years. It would like to be able to
buy 84 regional jets, and then link every subsequent one to the
addition of one narrow-body jet.
</P>
<P>
   The deep resentment of management has helped line up the support
of Northwest's other unions behind the pilots. But it has also tied
the hands of union leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the International Association of Machinists,
which represents 27,000 Northwest employees, including maintenance
workers, customer service agents and baggage handlers, reached a
tentative contract with the company. But the rank and file rejected
it in July.
</P>
<P>
   The union has asked the National Mediation Board, which oversees
labor issues in the airline and rail industries, to declare an
impasse, starting a 30-day cooling-off period after which the union
could strike. The board has not yet made a decision.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the company is reluctant to give in to the
pilots because it knows that the other unions will then demand an
equally generous settlement. Hirst said that Northwest would end up
with higher costs than its larger competitors. But that does not
win the sympathy of Joe Scarcella, a Northwest flight attendant for
the last 15 years and member of the Teamsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what we deserve and I know what this company makes,''
he said as he demonstrated in support of the pilots in New York on
Friday. ``There is plenty to go around.''

   INTERNATIONAL (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-BARTER (Novgorod, Russia) _ Russia's currency may be
tumbling. Its stock market may lie in ruins. But Yevgeny Shulman is
used to operating without money. Shulman's factory churns out
valves for nuclear power plants and heavy industry. What his
company receives in return is clear from a stroll around
headquarters: Newly minted cars and trucks are lined up near small
mountains of railroad-car brake pads and raw metal. By Michael R.
Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-BANKS (Moscow) _ As the ruble continues to crumble and
increasing numbers of insolvent banks are brought under state
control, untold numbers of Russians are left with the unenviable
choice of leaving their savings in barren banks or allowing the
accounts to be transferred to a state-owned bank at a fraction of
their value. By Timothy L. O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   NKOREA-KIM (Tokyo) _ North Korea on Saturday became the first
Communist country to transfer government power within a family
dynasty, as it anointed Marshal Kim Jong Il as its ``Great Leader''
and head of an expanded National Defense Commission. By Nicholas D.
Kristof.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-JAPAN-SPLIT (San Francisco) _ The economic policy leaders
of the world's two largest economies, the United States and Japan,
spent hours here Friday night talking about the heightened risk of
global recession and a further spread of the turmoil that has
engulfed Asia, Russia and now Latin America. But they left Saturday
morning with no new plans, and an uneasy sense that Japan and the
United States remain on different wavelengths about how quickly
countries must act. By David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-ASSESS (Limerick, Ireland) _ It has been a question from
the start of President Clinton's five-day trip to Russia, Ireland
and Northern Ireland this week: will his domestic troubles affect
his ability to function abroad as the nation's leader? By John M.
Broder.
</P>

   U.S.-BINLADEN (Washington) _ A look at U.S. thinking on Osama
Bin Laden, who has been linked to a terror campaign against the
United States. By James Risen.
</P>
<P>
   INDONESIA-CHINESE (Jakarta, Indonesia) _ Though they make up
little more than 3 percent of Indonesia's population of more than
200 million, ethnic Chinese are the nation's trading class, from
shopkeepers to billionaire managers of multinational conglomerates,
and they control as much as 70 percent of the Indonesia's private
economy. They are also often the target of scapegoatism for the
nation's ills. By Seth Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   JORDAN-KING (Kerak, Jordan) _ King Hussein has reigned for 45
years, more than twice as long as Ahmed Thneibat has been alive.
But now the king is undergoing cancer treatment for the second time
in six years, and Thneibat and other Jordanians are apprehensive
about what is to come. By Douglas Jehl.
</P>
<P>
   GERMAN-KOHL-HEIR (Bonn, Germany) _ In dire straits, a political
party taps its most popular figure to lead the campaign to cling to
power. Right? Wrong, at least in Germany. As this country heads for
a national election on Sept. 27 that will chart its course into the
21st century, the focus for many people is on whether Chancellor
Helmut Kohl will survive. Behind him, though, there is a figure far
less known outside Germany, but just as familiar to Germans,
Wolfgang Schaeuble. By Alan Cowell.

<P>
   NATIONAL (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   PUBLIC-HOUSING-REFORM (Chicago) _ From Hartford, Conn., and
Newark, N.J., to Denver and San Francisco, the federal government
is working with cities to clear the very slums it helped create:
public housing projects crippled by flawed policies and
mismanagement. Nowhere is the challenge greater than at Chicago's
Robert Taylor Homes, the nation's largest housing project, much of
which is ``considered the worst slum area in the United States,''
according to its landlord, the Chicago Housing Authority.

</P>
<P>
   STATEHOUSE-CAMPAIGNS (Raleigh, N.C.) _ With partisan control of
legislatures at risk in a remarkable number of states, and with
states inheriting vast new responsibilities from Washington, the
once-quaint business of legislative politics has become intensely
competitive, sophisticated and costly. By Kevin Sack.
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-RDP (Halifax, Nova Scotia) _ As busloads of grieving
relatives made their way onto the rocky spit of land closest to the
wreckage of Swissair Flight 111, investigators said Saturhat they
had made little progress in learning what caused the plane to crash
into the sea on Wednesday night minutes after its pilot reported
smoke in the cockpit. By Michael Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   ANTITERROR-U.S. _ At a time of growing fear of terrorism within
America's borders, senior state and local officials say the federal
government still has no coherent system for deterring or responding
to it. By Judith Miller.
</P>
<P>
   NORTHWEST-STRIKE _ Northwest Airlines says that the only issue

maintenance workers shut down Eastern Airlines in 1989 _ seems to
be trust. By Laurence Zuckerman.
</P>
<P>
   FLA-CUBA-EXCHANGE (Miami Beach) _ For Carlos Varela, who sings
of present-day Cuba, warts and all, playing Miami meant the first
few baby steps into a market virtually closed to him because he
lives in Cuba. In cultural exchanges allowed in recent years under
the American economic embargo of the island, Cuba-based artists
have toured all over the United States, but they have generally
skipped Miami, where many Cuban-Americans shun them as envoys of
the Cuban government and take offense at their presence in exile
territory. By Mireya Navarro.

SPORTS COLUMN: HIGH HOPES  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS GEORGE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   High hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Each National Football League team that kicks off the season
Sunday is unbeaten. Each thinks it can win its division. The
playoffs dance in each team's head and visions of Super Bowl glory
tingle each team's spine.
</P>
<P>
   And then reality strikes. They have to play the games. And one
by one, all but two teams slip, slide and crash. It is a
high-stakes dance of huge egos clashing, of old rivalries renewed
and new ones created.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a new order.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the dominant teams of this decade will give way to that new
order. Sweeping change _ franchises moving to new cities, free
agency being put in place, a new collective bargaining agreement,
$17.6 billion in new television contracts, new coaches, new star
players _ have already occurred this decade. And new powerhouses
are on the way while old stars begin to fade.
</P>
<P>
   Among the teams on an immediate upswing are the Baltimore
Ravens, the Jacksonville Jaguars, the Seattle Seahawks and the
Tennessee Oilers in the American Conference, and the Arizona
Cardinals, the Minnesota Vikings and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in
the National Conference.
</P>
<P>
   These teams are fighting deep water: the Buffalo Bills and San
Diego Chargers in the AFC, and the Chicago Bears, Philadelphia
Eagles and St. Louis Rams in the NFC
</P>
<P>
   The league's marquee franchises of the '90s, the Dallas Cowboys
and the San Francisco 49ers, face huge obstacles to retaining their
lofty stature. Both are older and more injury prone, depleted by
free agency losses and in transition from changes in coaches
(Dallas) and management (San Francisco).
</P>
<P>
   After 13 consecutive Super Bowl losses, the AFC finally toppled
the NFC when Denver won in January. And the AFC is in position to
put together its own string with a more bountiful crop of young,
skilled quarterbacks and young, athletic teams.
</P>
<P>
   Four coaches will face inordinate pressure as the 1998 season
unfolds. Dave Wannstedt has little chance to survive in Chicago.
Norv Turner is in trouble if his Washington team does not make the
playoffs. Dennis Erickson has all the tools to win in Seattle and
must. And Ray Rhodes appears at the end of his rope in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   There is a solution for all of them. Get to Super Bowl XXXIII on
Jan. 31 at Pro Player Stadium in Miami. And win it. Sunday's start
is exhilarating. But it's all about the finish.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE STADIUM GAME &LR;  _ During this decade, NFL executives saw that
too many of their stadiums were crumbling before their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Several have been upgraded to include luxury boxes and suites.
Two teams will play in brand new stadiums, the Ravens and the
Buccaneers. The Ravens open their new digs in downtown Baltimore
Sunday when they play host to the Pittsburgh Steelers. The
Buccaneers will wait until they entertain the Chicago Bears on
Sept. 20.
</P>
<P>
   And the Oilers, after having played last season in the Liberty
Bowl in Memphis, will play at Vanderbilt Stadium near downtown
Nashville. Their first game there is Sept. 13 against the Chargers.
Next season they move again, into a permanent home, a new stadium
in downtown Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE LONG GAME &LR;  _ The tendency in the passing game has been to
use quicker quarterback drops and quicker throws and shorter passes
to offset blitzing defenses. Is this the season that offenses begin
to respond with more long passes? It could be.
</P>
<P>
   It would require more pass protection, keeping in both backs and
a tight end to block or a one-back, two-tight end set. A fleet
receiver with a dynamic burst is needed. So is a strong-armed
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   The critical ingredient is a play-caller who has the backbone to
make the call and the moxie to know when to make it, catching a
defense off stride. One who recognizes a matchup mismatch. The
short passing game remains the standard. But there is room for more
bombs. So bombs away.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GOTCHA! &LR;  _ One of the amusing and yet infuriating aspects of
free agency is signing away other teams' top-notch free agents,
especially doing it within your own division, when you can bolster
your own squad and weaken a rival. Amusing for the receiver.
Infuriating for the giver.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets did this to the New England Patriots. Running back
Curtis Martin left the Patriots to return to his old boss, Bill
Parcells, and it added fuel to an already red-hot rivalry among the
franchises. Both teams reside in the AFC East.
</P>
<P>
   Another example was receiver Yancey Thigpen moving from the
Pittsburgh Steelers to the Oilers, both of the AFC Central.
Steelers players say they will miss Thigpen's big plays and
leaping, twisting catches. The Oilers say he gives them a go-to-guy
in the passing game.
</P>
<P>
   Another byproduct of this type of signing is that it gives a
team an understanding of the inner workings, in scheme, philosophy,
style and preparation, of a divisional opponent. In both of these
cases, the receivers (Jets, Oilers) are chasing the more powerful
givers (Patriots, Steelers). Used correctly, this ploy is an
invaluable asset. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DEUCES WILD &LR;  _ Three duos on three clubs will be worth watching
in '98.
</P>
<P>
   In Buffalo, an unhappy Bruce Smith saw Ted Washington, his mate
along the defensive line, sign during the off season for more money
than Smith. Smith was hot _ he had signed a new deal last year and
now wanted another one, bigger than Washington's. Buffalo refused.
Smith said he will play, but not with a smile. It seems that much
of the joy of playing is gone for him because of the contract
situation.
</P>
<P>
   Fans see this as arrogant and selfish and stupid. Smith does not
understand that. It all falls in the lap of the new head coach,
Wade Phillips, who has to get Smith ready to play football.
</P>
<P>
   In Cincinnati, the Bengals' players are fond of quarterback Jeff
Blake. Too bad. Coach Bruce Coslet has named Neil O'Donnell the
starter. The players believe in one guy and the coach chooses
another. How is this going to play out?
</P>
<P>
   And in Washington, two huge defensive tackles, Dana Stubblefield
and Dan Wilkinson, will attempt to plug the Redskins' soft middle.
They were a $57.4 million investment for Washington, and Redskin
fans are expecting them to provide better defense than the
Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IMPACT ROOKIES &LR;  These are the players most likely to have a
sudden impact and win rookie of the year honors:
</P>
<P>
   _Randy Moss, Vikings, wide receiver _ So many teams passed on
him in the draft. He is intent on proving it was a huge mistake.
And he is quite capable of doing that.
</P>
<P>
   _Ryan Leaf, Chargers, quarterback _ He gets off to a faster
start than Peyton Manning. He has warm weather in San Diego that
will help the passing game and a passing offense more tailored for
his skills.
</P>
<P>
   _John Avery, Dolphins, running back _ He may finally give the
Dolphins' ground game gusto. He is quick and runs fluidly in the
open field and displays desire.
</P>
<P>
   _Charles Woodson, Raiders, cornerback _ So talented. Starts
immediately. Makes plays.
</P>
<P>
   _Ahman Green, Seahawks, running back _ Ricky Watters is the
featured running back in Seattle, but look for Green to play a
spirited role on third-down plays and as a receiver from the
backfield.

   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ As busloads of grieving relatives made
their way onto the rocky spit of land closest to the wreckage of
Swissair Flight 111, investigators said Saturday that they had made
little progress in learning what caused the plane to crash into the
sea on Wednesday night minutes after its pilot reported smoke in
the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   The first bus of relatives drove up the narrow, winding road to
Peggy's Cove, a fishing village and tourist attraction about 20
miles southwest of here, at 8:45 a.m. Around 20 people filed off
the bus, some holding hands, some arm-in-arm, and were met in
olive-drab tents by clergy members, Red Cross officials and other
counselors.
</P>
<P>
   Then they made their way down the jetty, past the white
lighthouse with its red top, and laid wreaths at the water's edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to get down to the rocks, and they want to say their
last words at the rocks quietly and peacefully,'' said Murielle
Provost, who is directing the Red Cross operation.
</P>
<P>
   By 11 a.m., more than 100 relatives had walked down the narrow
pathway past the lighthouse and toward the sea, nearly all of them
carrying bouquets of roses and carnations tethered to pieces of
wood to help them float to sea in memory of the crash's 229
victims. Some carried teddy bears. One woman dabbed her eyes
beneath her sunglasses. They were followed by Red Cross workers
carrying boxes of tissues.
</P>
<P>
   Among those making the sad pilgrimage was Tim Larson, 39, from
East Hartford, Conn., whose wife's uncle, Victor Rizza, 58, died in
the crash with his son Antonino, 15. ``This is such a pretty
town,'' he said, looking off at the rocky jetties, the lighthouse
and the churning sea as his voice cracked. ``You read about this
stuff and you see it, and it's never supposed to happen to you.''
</P>
<P>
   The fog, rain, and high seas that hampered the early search and
salvage efforts lifted Saturday, and Canadian officials said that
although a brisk north wind was still blowing, they were hopeful
that search teams would be able to make progress as they scoured
the seas for more victims and clues.
</P>
<P>
   But, much to the frustration of investigators, the most
important pieces of evidence that would help them piece together
the last moments of the flight _ the so-called black boxes
containing the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder
_ have yet to be found.
</P>
<P>
   The boxes are equipped with audio beacons, or ``pingers,'' that
emit signals for the purpose of helping searchers find them, but no
trace of them has been picked up by sonar or by a Canadian
submarine that combed the area on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, remote-controlled submersibles equipped with video
cameras, which are a kind of underwater robot, were flown here from
British Columbia. Salvagers sent the submersibles, known as Flying
Fish, to the ocean floor, about 120 feet below the surface, in
several spots where sonar detected what might be pieces of the
wrecked airplane. As the weather improved, the first divers went
into the water Saturday morning shortly after 8 o'clock.
</P>
<P>
   The searchers continued to scan the ocean floor with sonar,
comparing the results with existing charts and looking for any
anomalies. But no large pieces of wreckage have been identified,
Lt. Cmdr. Michael Considine of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police
said. ``To date, we have not located any large pieces of
fuselage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The search-and-salvage mission, involving a flotilla of more
than 40 ships and boats and 1,000 workers, was dubbed Operation
Persistence by the rescuers. Officials set up a Web site for
information about the search:
www.marlant.hlfx.dnd.ca/marlant/swissair.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   Investigators from the Canadian Transportation Safety Board
pored over the technological evidence that was left behind,
studying the transcripts of tape-recorded conversations between the
pilot and the control tower and scrutinizing radar tapes to chart
the plane's final, erratic movements before it went down into the
ocean, about five miles off the shore of Peggy's Cove.
</P>
<P>
   The crew of the Preserver, a Canadian supply ship, directed
smaller boats as they picked up debris from a crash site that was
growing ever wider from wind and tides.
</P>
<P>
   Cpl. Frank Skidmore of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said
that the search area had grown to a 70-square-mile swath of ocean,
and that the Canadian authorities have placed the entire area off
limits to boats and planes for nearly 50 miles of coastline, from
Mahone Bay to the mouth of Halifax Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   On land, 250 Canadian soldiers and 300 volunteers fanned out to
scour the rocky coastline to gather the debris and wreckage
buffeted ashore by the tides.
</P>
<P>
   They preserved everything: the blue sleeping mask with the
Swissair logo, a turtleneck sweater found peeping out from beneath
the sand and twisted pieces of metal and foam that were difficult
to place. It all went into clear plastic evidence bags.
</P>
<P>
   On board the Preserver, all the human remains that were
recovered were carefully labeled as to where they were found and
then flown off the ship by Sea King helicopters and taken to a
makeshift morgue in an airplane hangar at a nearby air base, where
a team of pathologists began the long and painstaking task of
trying to identify them through dental records, X-rays and DNA
samples.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Saturday that the first victim had been
identified. Dr. John Butt, the chief medical examiner of Nova
Scotia, said Friday that in addition to trying to identify the
victims, his team would see whether the bodies yielded clues to
what happened in the last minutes before the crash. Butt said that
investigators have asked the pathologist to conduct toxicology
tests, to try to determine whether the victims inhaled smoke before
they died.
</P>
<P>
   Butt said that a significant number of bags containing human
remains had been brought ashore in the past three days.
</P>
<P>
   It is the kind of operation that Nova Scotia has come to be
familiar with in the four centuries since the first shipwreck was
reported off the treacherous coasts.
</P>
<P>
   The most famous instance was in 1911 when the Titanic went down
700 miles east of here. The Cunard Liner Carpathia took the
survivors to New York; the dead were brought here.
</P>
<P>
   Don Flynn, whose family has run Cruikshank's Halifax Funeral
Home here for generations, said that he was called the night of the
crash and told to begin making preparations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be our biggest job since my grandfather handled the
Halifax explosion,'' he said, referring to the worst disaster in
Halifax history, when a munitions ship exploded in Halifax harbor
in 1917, killing more than 1,700 and leveling whole neighborhoods
here.
</P>
<P>
   Out at Peggy's Cove, Skidmore said that it was difficult to
watch the family members grieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're devastated by the tragedy,'' he said. ``Though they
don't expect to find loved ones alive, they're hopeful that we will
at least find identifiable remains.''

CUBAN PERFORMERS GETTING KINDER RECEPTION IN MIAMI

 By MIREYA NAVARRO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI BEACH _ At a recent nightclub concert before a
word-of-mouth audience of fewer than 200 people, the Cuban
singer-songwriter Carlos Varela surveyed the room from the stage
and said, ``This looks like a concert in Havana.''
</P>
<P>
   But between the standing ovations, the shouted requests for
songs and the tears, it was obvious on which side of the Florida
Straits he found himself. ``I came in '80!'' one woman yelled. ``I
came in '98!'' a man piped in. ``I was born here!'' another man
said.
</P>
<P>
   For Varela, who sings of present-day Cuba, warts and all,
playing Miami meant the first few baby steps into a market
virtually closed to him because he lives in Cuba. In cultural
exchanges allowed in recent years under the American economic
embargo of the island, Cuba-based artists have toured all over the
United States, but they have generally skipped Miami, where many
Cuban-Americans shun them as envoys of the Cuban government and
take offense at their presence in exile territory.
</P>
<P>
   But recently, performers from Cuba took Miami by storm. Varela
put on his show here before leaving last week for appearances in
Chicago and Madison, Wis., while a powerhouse group of Cuban
musicians, including the virtuoso pianist Chucho Valdes and his
group Irakere, headlined the annual music industry conference known
as Midem Latin America and Caribbean Music Market.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're giving me the happiest moment of my life,'' Francisco
Repilado, a 91-year-old traditional guitarist who is featured on
the 1998 Grammy-winning album ``Buena Vista Social Club'' and who
is better-known as Compay Segundo, told his audience at the
conference. ``I've traveled throughout Europe: London, Madrid,
Switzerland, Germany. And why not here?''
</P>
<P>
   Many outside South Florida may ask the same question, wondering
how people who promote the cause of democracy in Cuba can turn
around and censor artists from the island. Only two years ago,
protesters hurled insults and spat at concertgoers attending a show
by a Cuban jazz pianist, Gonzalo Rubalcaba, who did not even live
on the island but had not publicly repudiated its government.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, a Little Havana restaurant planning to
showcase a Cuban actress-singer, Rosita Fornes, was firebombed. And
last year, Midem failed in its effort to showcase Cuban artists
because of an ordinance that prohibits Miami-Dade County from doing
business with Cuba or anyone who does business with Cuba. (This
year, the problem was solved when the fund raising to coordinate
the music conference locally became strictly a private effort.)
</P>
<P>
   A more auspicious climate has greeted Cuban performers this
year. Isaac Delgado, a salsa singer; Vocal Sampling, an a cappella
group; Gema 4, another a cappella group; the band La Charanga
Habanera and Varela, who first performed here last March, have
played here at different times with no major incidents. Longtime
residents speculate that a confluence of factors may be at work,
including the impact of the death last November of Jorge Mas
Canosa, the most powerful exile leader advocating a hard line
toward Cuba, and Pope John Paul II's call for reconciliation in his
visit to Cuba in January.
</P>
<P>
   But a look at the audiences that come to see the Cubans offers
the best explanation: Generally black Cuban-Americans turn out for
Delgado; Cuban, Latin American and young people for Varela; a mixed
bag of music lovers for Valdes. It is a sample of changing
demographics, and generations, in Hispanic Miami that by now
includes the tens of thousands of Cubans who migrated over the last
two decades and had grown up with much of the music that has been
banned in this corner of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know the artists, they know the songs, they know the
words,'' said Maria Romeu, whose marketing company, Luna Media, has
promoted and co-produced several of the concerts. ``Miami has a new
portion of the population that hears that music and it is
infectious.''
</P>
<P>
   But new and old Miami still coexist, and the appearance of an
artist from Cuba sets off contrasting raw emotions. On the evening
of Compay Segundo's performance at the Miami Beach Convention
Center last week, a group of about 400 demonstrators waved little
Cuban flags, chanted ``Liberty! Liberty!'' and held up signs that
read: ``Castro's rats'' and ``Stop using Uncle Sam's money to
promote your Cuban hell.'' The group included former political
prisoners in Cuba, Cuban-American musicians and older exiles for
whom culture equates with politics if Fidel Castro's government is
involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``This intransigence of ours is a just intransigence,'' said
Miriam Sifontes, 51, a medical clinic owner. ``Castro is an
assassin.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the convention hall, meanwhile, the scene was almost
reverential. Interspersed among Midem's international delegates
were Cuban-Americans, including one man who sat with a cellular
phone perched on his shoulder. He said his grandfather in New York
was listening.
</P>
<P>
   Varela's concert at Starfish nightclub here three nights later
was even more jarring. Some women cried openly during some songs,
and two men left the room at one point, overcome by emotion.
Varela, 35, who played accompanied only by acoustic guitar, is
often described by music critics as the voice of Cuba's disgruntled
youth, a writer in the tradition of Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen
who writes verses like ``Freedom only exists when it belongs to no
one'' and ``What are windmills for, if there are no Quixotes
left?''
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets as real as anyone gets to describe Cuba,'' said Carlos
Betancourt, a 32-year-old Cuban-American painter who visited Cuba
for the first time this year out of curiosity. ``It was a very sad
concert and that's my definition of Cuba: a very sad country.''
</P>
<P>
   Varela's inspiration is not criticism, however, but ``the
Cuban's illusion of transforming things,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Although he tours internationally and plays concert halls in
Havana, Cuba has banned some of his music from the radio. So has
Miami, as it does with other Cuba-based artists.
</P>
<P>
   Varela said he had received nothing but love and respect in
Miami and that his shows here had been unusually intense because
the public ``wants to condense all their longings in a two-hour
concert.'' But noting the commercial radio ban of his music, and
the fact that he and other Cuban performers so far have mostly
played concerts for select audiences or in small venues with little
advance publicity, Varela said he hoped for the day he could ``fill
stadiums and sell records.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's make no mistake,'' said Varela, always the realist, ``I
have not sung in Miami.'' &QL;

   REVIVING RANGERS
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Rodriguez hit 10 home runs in the Texas Rangers' first 47
games. The Rangers then played 78 games without their catcher
hitting his 11th home run. But once Rodriguez found the range
again, he slugged six home runs in the space of 14 Texas games.
</P>
<P>
   And how about Rodriguez's prolific run-producing teammate? Juan
Gonzalez has batted eight times in his career against Bryce Florie
of Detroit and has eight hits, none of them cheap. He has ripped
five doubles, a triple and two home runs, giving him a 2.625
slugging percentage for his troubles. Gonzalez battered Florie for
half of those hits in one game last week and drove in seven runs
against him.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO'S SLUGGERS
</P>
<P>
   Three days apart, the two Chicago teams had their home run
records broken. There was just a little difference in the number of
years the records had lasted.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday Albert Belle hit his 42d home run, surpassing the
41 Frank Thomas hit for the White Sox in 1993. Last Friday Sammy
Sosa socked his 57th, slipping past Hack Wilson, who hit 56 for the
Cubs in 1930.
</P>
<P>
   POWER DOESN'T EQUAL VICTORY
</P>
<P>
   In this season of the celebration of the home run, look no
further than the Seattle Mariners to see how overrated home runs
are. The Mariners lead the major leagues in home runs with 207 but
haven't had a winning record since May 12.
</P>
<P>
   Readily acknowledging the need for a more diversified offense,
Manager Lou Piniella said: ``I've talked about that for a couple
years. It's great to have power, but when the power isn't there,
you have to be able to manufacture. And in that area we've
struggled. We have to be able to win games without hitting the ball
out of the ball park. For a couple of years we outslugged people
and hid our deficiencies, but this year we haven't been able to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners discovered, too, that their minor league system is
in need of help before it can provide aid.
</P>
<P>
   The season, Piniella said, ``shows you the importance of a farm
system that's ready to produce,'' adding: ``Ours has been dry. We
didn't have anywhere to go unless we wanted to throw money at the
problem and we haven't thrown any at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Has the season been his most disappointing as a manager?
</P>
<P>
   ``We were expecting better,'' he said. ``We felt when the season
started that we would be competitive. We came off of a 90-win
season, the first in franchise history. We had basically the same
people back. So when you look at it in that respect, to be under
.500 and out of the race, yes, it's disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with all of the other elements of a poor season was the
Randy Johnson mess. The Mariners announced last November they would
not sign their No.1 pitcher to a contract extension, and he asked
to be traded, but they did not trade him. He was a festering sore
at the heart of the team until he was traded July 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you put everything in perspective,'' Piniella said, ``if
it was going to come to that, it should've been done early on, last
winter. We could've gotten some players back and had money to go
out in the free-agent market and fill in other holes. We didn't do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that was a positive for us,'' he continued.
``That started in the spring and basically stayed with us the whole
summer. It drains you somewhat. When you have somebody that's not
happy, you're better off moving that individual than trying to make
it work. I think this organization has learned that lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   BLAME IT ON SELIG?
</P>
<P>
   When the owners elected Bud Selig commissioner July 9, his
Milwaukee Brewers had a winning record, 43-42, and were only nine
games out of first. Since Selig's election, for which he had to
place his ownership in the team in a trust and relinquish operation
of the club to his daughter, Wendy Selig-Prieb, the Brewers have
staggered to a 23-33 record and have plummeted 22 games from the
top.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes indication that the team's general manager is in inner
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a week after saying that Phil Garner would return as
manager next season even if the Brewers didn't fix themselves, Sal
Bando apparently thinks he might have spoken too soon. In the
interim, the Brewers lost three consecutive games to the expansion
Arizona Diamondbacks _ right in Selig's warm-weather backyard _ and
Bando didn't like the way they looked doing it.
</P>
<P>
   His latest pronouncement: He will re-evaluate Garner's status
after the season.
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA'S COMEBACK
</P>
<P>
   On the subject of expansion teams, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays
catapulted well ahead of the Diamondbacks in the early weeks of the
season, winning 16 of their first 37 games while their fellow
neophytes won 8 of their first 39, a difference of 9 games in the
standings. Those records took the new teams to May 14. As recently
as the end of July, the Devil Rays held a four-and-a-half-game
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, in the midst of a seven-game winning streak that
they took into their game Saturday. the Diamondbacks edged in front
of the Devil Rays for the first time in the teams' first season, by
a percentage point. They remain in front. &QL;

ETHNIC CHINESE IN INDONESIA STILL FEARFUL
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By SETH MYDANS 
   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ More than three months after huge riots
swept the city, the back lanes of Glodok, Jakarta's Chinatown, are
still strewn with ash and bricks and bits of broken glass.
Multistory department stores are fire-blackened shells; small shops
are rubble.
</P>
<P>
   On an alleyway near a Buddhist temple, old men drink coffee and
look over their shoulders when they talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are always the scapegoats,'' said a 50-year-old ethnic
Chinese shopkeeper who lost his shop during the three days of
rioting in May, the week before President Suharto stepped down.
``People tell us to leave, but we have nowhere to go. We are
Indonesian, but people here don't recognize us as Indonesian. So we
have no country, no home and no guarantee of our future.''
</P>
<P>
   The shopkeeper, who said he was afraid to give his name to a
reporter, said he had seen the anonymous pamphlets that have been
circulating lately, warning of further attacks. He said he had also
seen the small painted circles and triangles that have appeared on
Chinese-owned shops and homes, ostensibly marking them for arson or
looting. ``They are just trying to sow terror,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he was too poor to join the exodus of tens of
thousands of ethnic Chinese who have fled the country, in several
waves of panic, as rumors of new riots have swept Jakarta and other
cities like Semarang, Surabaya and Solo.
</P>
<P>
   Although the shopkeeper and others like him lack the means or
connections to leave the country, many more prosperous members of
the ethnic minority have found haven overseas.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the country's wealthier Chinese, who control
many of its big businesses, are said to have transferred billions
of dollars of cash abroad, dealing a severe blow to Indonesia's
prospects for economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Though they make up little more than 3 percent of Indonesia's
population of more than 200 million, ethnic Chinese are the
nation's trading class, from shopkeepers to billionaire managers of
multinational conglomerates, and they control as much as 70 percent
of the Indonesia's private economy. They are also among the
country's young and well-educated professionals, own many of its
factories and form the backbone of the distribution network for
food and other commodities.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, an angry backlash among overseas Chinese in other
Asian countries could do long-term damage if this economically
powerful group decides to take its business elsewhere. In one of
the most concerted political actions this loose-knit international
community has ever taken in recent years, ethnic Chinese have
staged protests in Hong Kong, Taiwan, the Philippines and the
United States, as well as in China itself.
</P>
<P>
   Their anger has been inflamed by reports that organized groups
of rioters engaged not only in the burning and looting of
Chinese-owned shops but in the systematic humiliation and rape of
ethnic Chinese women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indonesia: rapist capital of the world,'' read a banner at a
recent demonstration in the Philippines. In China, the official
People's Daily said in a commentary, ``These criminal acts have
sparked grave concern and strong indignation among the people in
China and the overseas Chinese community.''
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups and women's shelters here in the capital,
Jakarta, have reported that more than 160 women and girls were
raped in the rioting last May. They say 20 of these women died as
the result of the assaults, some by suicide.
</P>
<P>
   But their reports have been undermined by a failure to bring
forward any victim who could give a first-hand account, by what now
appear to be slipshod methods of collecting data, and by what may
have been a disinformation campaign in the distribution of
horrifying but inauthentic photographs of purported victims.
Women's advocates say these pictures, distributed over the
Internet, could be part of a campaign by people trying to increase
the fears of ethnic Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Although human rights investigators stand by their accounts,
saying the victims are too traumatized to talk publicly, these
lapses have opened room for doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Women's Affairs Minister Tutty Alawiah, one of the leaders of a
government investigation into the reported rapes, said, ``The team
has been conducting an investigation for one-and-a-half months now
but has found no woman who fell victim to gang rape or who claimed
to have been raped during the May riots.''
</P>
<P>
   And Gen. Wiranto, chief of the armed forces, dismissed the
reports as ``simply a rumor that did not have strong supporting
evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The unemployed shopkeeper in Glodok, sipping his glass of
coffee, said he had also heard of the rapes but did not know anyone
who had been involved.

ANALYSIS: MIXED VIEWS ON WHETHER CLINTON IS LOSING CLOUT ABROAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMERICK, Ireland _ It has been a question from the start of
President Clinton's five-day trip to Russia, Ireland and Northern
Ireland last week: Will his domestic troubles affect his ability to
function abroad as the United States' leader?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, from the president's aides, has been a resounding
and unanimous no.
</P>
<P>
   But others are not so certain, and a strong piece of evidence
came from Moscow on Friday, when Acting Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin announced measures to try to pull Russia out of its
economic tailspin.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a day after Clinton left Moscow, where he delivered a
series of stern lectures on fiscal and monetary responsibility,
Chernomyrdin proposed an ``economic dictatorship'' that would
include a huge infusion of new rubles to prop up failing banks,
almost certainly a prescription for a burst of inflation and a step
that Clinton specifically warned against.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Chernomyrdin is in a tough battle for confirmation
and Russia's internal politics are little influenced by outside
forces. But it was clear that Russia's leaders either were not
listening to Clinton's lectures or did not fear the effects of
defying him.
</P>
<P>
   Other evidence came on the front pages of American newspapers
all week, which were dominated by stories not of Clinton's
diplomacy but of the slow progress of his penitence over his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton took questions twice from reporters, during a news
conference Wednesday with Russian President Boris Yeltsin and a
Friday meeting with Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern.
</P>
<P>
   Both appearances were overshadowed by questions about Ms.
Lewinsky, and the coverage in the United States focused almost
exclusively on the president's calibrated regrets over the affair.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars say it is impossible to separate a president's domestic
fortunes from his prestige abroad. Although Clinton remains popular
overseas _ particularly in Ireland, where he is given credit for
supporting efforts that led to the Northern Ireland peace accord
this year _ leaders recognize that even without the Lewinsky
scandal, Clinton is a lame duck with a little more than two years
remaining in his term, if he completes it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult to be damaged goods at home and to be
effective abroad,'' said Dmitri Simes, director of the Nixon Center
research organization in Washington and a longtime foreign-policy
aide to former President Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Simes said that many Russians have written Clinton off, not only
because he is crippled by domestic difficulties but also because
the Russian people perceive him as being too close to Yeltsin, who
is widely reviled by his countrymen.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton today lacks the moral authority to be ``a lasting
partner for the Russians, particularly during the post-Yeltsin
era,'' Simes asserted.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides insisted that the president was not hampered in
his ability to do his job by the low cloud of scandal hanging over
him.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's press secretary, Mike McCurry, said Friday that
Clinton operated in ``parallel universes'' _ battling scandal at
home while conducting high policy abroad _ and declared that the
two did not intersect.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Clinton's authority had been diminished by the
Lewinsky matter, McCurry replied: ``It clearly has not been, and I
think the president takes some satisfaction in that. He dealt with
world leaders on this trip and is confident that he continues to do
good work in the interest of the American people as he fulfills his
constitutional responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a less guarded moment, McCurry conceded that the Lewinsky
matter had ``detracted'' from the main missions of the trip _
encouraging Russian leaders to stick to the course of economic
reform and urging Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland to
press ahead on the road to reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   But McCurry and other aides blamed the press for an unhealthy
obsession with the Lewinsky matter and for drowning out the
president's message.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all so circular,'' said one of Clinton's top foreign
policy aides, his voice tinged with bitterness. ``You ask the
questions and then you write that Clinton was forced once again to
deal with Lewinsky. It hasn't come up in one meeting that we've had
on this trip.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the Lewinsky matter did not arise in meetings, neither
did foreign leaders rally to the president's defense, at least not
in public. McCurry assured reporters that Clinton had received many
messages of encouragement from leaders around the world, but
declined to name any of them.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Yeltsin nor Ahern spoke on the president's behalf as he
took questions about the scandal. Nor did British Prime Minister
Tony Blair, with whom Clinton spent the day in Northern Ireland on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Blair offered Clinton private solace and public support during a
visit to Washington last January, shortly after the president's
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky was first revealed.
</P>
<P>
   The trip has taken Clinton from meetings in a Moscow gripped by
political and economic crisis to a meeting with families of the
victims of the car bomb in Omagh, Northern Ireland, to a festive
rally in the streets of Limerick on Saturday morning. Clinton's
mood has shifted as dramatically as the settings: somber in Moscow,
mournful in Omagh, upbeat in Limerick.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was hailed as a peacemaker in his appearances in
Northern Ireland and Ireland during the last three days, and he
clearly reveled in the warmth of his reception here.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere his message to the Irish was the same: Though terror
will surely return, the determination to have peace will overcome
those who seek to destroy it.
</P>
<P>
   Looking out over a sea of waving U.S. and Irish flags among the
crowd packed onto O'Connell Street in downtown Limerick on Saturday
morning, Clinton said, ``As we mourn the losses in Omagh and the
three little boys who were killed and taken from their parents'
arms, remember there will still be efforts by the enemies of peace
to break your will, to get you to turn back, to get you to lose
faith.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't do it,'' the president implored the enthusiastic throng
of thousands. ``Don't do it. This is you at your best. Do not let
them break your will.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was to spend the afternoon pursuing the real reason he
came to southwest Ireland on Saturday, playing golf at the historic
course at Ballybunion before returning to Washington on Saturday
night.

LOS ANGELES POLICE FORCE DIGS OUT GRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As a police officer in Los Angeles' busiest
precinct, near downtown Los Angeles, Rafael Antonio Perez was
responsible for investigating gang crimes and testifying against
suspects in court.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, it was Perez who entered the courtroom in handcuffs
and a blue county jail jumpsuit to hear charges against him:
stealing three kilograms (about six and a half pounds) of cocaine
from an evidence locker at the Los Angeles Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, 31, a nine-year veteran of the force who was arrested by
his fellow officers on Aug. 25, pleaded not guilty to charges of
drug possession, grand theft and forgery.
</P>
<P>
   The felony complaint against Perez says he checked the cocaine
out of the property room on March 2 by forging on the evidence log
the signature of another police officer with the same last name and
never returned it. If convicted, Perez, who is still in jail, faces
a maximum sentence of more than eight years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   While the brazen nature of the theft, according to the charges,
is surprising enough, it is made all the more so by the Los Angeles
Police Department's reputation for being intolerant of graft. The
department has had no shortage of problems over the years, accused
by civil rights advocates and others of poor treatment of
minorities, political spying and use of excessive force, most
publicly in the beating of Rodney King. But even the department's
harshest detractors say it is relatively incorruptible.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, it's been a consistent theme that the LAPD has
done a good job when it comes to that issue,'' said Paul Hoffman, a
civil rights lawyer and former legal director of the local chapter
of the American Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   That has not always been the case. Through the early half of the
20th century the department, in tandem with City Hall, was known
for accepting payoffs from gambling dens and prostitution houses to
allow them to continue to operate, shaking down unions and business
owners, even dynamiting the car of a former officer who had begun
documenting police misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
   Backlash against those years of corruption eventually resulted
in the recall of Mayor Frank Shaw and a revision of the city
charter that made the department virtually autonomous from City
Hall. It also brought about the rise of William Parker, who became
chief of the department in 1950 and is given credit for purging it
of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Another part of his legacy is a paramilitary style of law
enforcement that did not shy from use of force. It was a theme
carried on under Chief Ed Davis, who took over from Parker, and
then under Daryl Gates, who was chief from 1978 until 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their credo was, `Bust somebody's head and we'll back you up,
but if you lie, cheat or steal''' you're in trouble, said Joe
Domanick, author of the book ``To Protect and to Serve'' (Simon &AMP;
Schuster, 1994), a critical history of the Los Angeles Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the department has had some high-profile corruption
cases over the years, including thefts of radios from shops along
Hollywood Boulevard in the 1980s and the convictions of three
officers in the late 80s in a murder-for-hire scheme. The
investigation of Perez, one police official said, has been driven
by the current chief, Bernard Parks, who took over last year.
</P>
<P>
   In a bail hearing last week, Deputy District Attorney Richard
Rosenthal said that in addition to stealing the narcotics, Perez
tried to sell a kilo of cocaine through a confidential informer
last December. Rosenthal also told the judge that Perez lied in
court to obtain leniency for two drug dealers, one of whom he was
having a romantic relationship with. The authorities now suspect
that that dealer distributed the three kilograms of stolen cocaine,
Rosenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   Perez's lawyer, Winston McKesson, said that his client
``categorically'' denied the charges and that a search of his home
revealed no evidence of drug dealing. McKesson also said that
Perez's fingerprints were not found on the evidence room ledger
with the forged signature.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Perez's case is not the only one proving nettlesome for the
department's reputation. Another officer, David Mack, is awaiting
trial in federal court on charges of robbing $722,000 from a Bank
of America branch with the help of a girlfriend who worked at the
bank. Mack has pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   But police officials, who are now investigating ``everything
that surrounds'' Perez, say they believe the cocaine theft is an
anomaly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The department wanted to show that we can police our own,''
Cmdr. Dan Shotz said. ``But there's a lot of disappointment and
it's embarrassing. We got our highs, and this is one of our
lows.'' &QL;

THE RIGHT COLLEGE GUIDE, FROM THE RIGHT, FOR THE RIGHT-MINDED  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Del., Mass., Calif., Ohio, Minn., Texas, Vt.)   By WILLIAM H. HONAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new, frankly conservative guide to the United States' top 100
colleges excoriates Harvard University, sings the praises of the
University of Dallas and criticizes many institutions for unchecked
political correctness.
</P>
<P>
   The book, called ``Choosing the Right College,'' is aimed, its
editors say, at exposing the political biases of academe, the
prevalence of permissive sex and the lack of core curriculums to
prospective students and their parents.
</P>
<P>
   The 672-page guide is published by the conservative
Intercollegiate Studies Institute Inc., of Wilmington, Del., one of
the oldest student-oriented educational organizations in the
nation. The institute was founded in the 1950s with William F.
Buckley Jr. as its first president. William Bennett, a former
education secretary and a conservative Republican, has contributed
an introduction.
</P>
<P>
   The guide criticizes all the Ivy League schools but reserves the
roughest treatment for Harvard, which, it contends has ``lost much
originality and now marches in lock step with the dominant trends
of the intellectual world.''
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that Harvard has ``a star-studded faculty,'' the
guide deplores its ``politicized courses and departments,'' which
it lists as African studies, social studies, the Center for
Literacy and Cultural Studies, English, fine arts, anthropology,
Romance languages and literatures, comparative literature and
women's studies.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Huppe, a spokesman for Harvard, said the university has
never commented on rankings (Harvard comes up No. 1 in most others)
and added only, with a laugh, ``We seem to be in pretty good
company.''
</P>
<P>
   The University of California at Berkeley is criticized for not
shaking off the legacy of Mario Savio, the leader of the free
speech movement in the 1960s, and for fighting to preserve
affirmative action. One professor is quoted as saying, ``A Louis
Farrakhan-Ronald Reagan presidential race, if held at the
U.C.-Berkeley campus, would be a dead heat.''
</P>
<P>
   The guide also contends that Berkeley is so permissive that
students are permitted to ``walk around and attend classes in the
nude, so loath is the university to step on their right to free
expression.''
</P>
<P>
   Oberlin College in Ohio is criticized because, the guide says,
political correctness has become a ``religion'' and ``the Drag Ball
held every spring is easily the most popular social event on
campus.''
</P>
<P>
   Carleton College in Northfield, Minn., comes under attack
because it has ``no core curriculum to speak of'' and for its
``energetic promotion of the gay/lesbian/bisexual/transgendered
community on campus.''
</P>
<P>
   Pomona College and its president, Peter Stanley, are criticized
for having ``acceded to the demands of the political activists'' in
allowing the formation of an Asian-American studies department last
year. ``Why not an Italian-American studies department or a
Nepalese-American studies department?'' the authors ask
indignantly.
</P>
<P>
   Midge Decter, a neoconservative author and critic, said she was
delighted by the book. ``When I was shown the book, I suggested
that they add a final chapter entitled `Burn Them Down,''' she
said, with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The darlings of the guide include the University of Dallas, a
relatively new Roman Catholic institution, which is praised as
``one of the few genuinely countercultural universities in the
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Students there are ``taught to see freedom not as an opportunity
for self-aggrandizement, but as the ability to pursue truth,
goodness and beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   Another glowing report goes to Boston University, which the
guide said was spared from politicization because of determination
by its neoconservative president, John Silber, who recently
retired, ``not to reorder the university to suit passing whims of
intellectual fashion.'' It adds that he would not tolerate
employing ``politicized professors who'd rather indoctrinate their
students than teach them.''
</P>
<P>
   Middlebury College in Middlebury, Vt., is praised as ``a rarity
in higher education today in that multiculturalist talk seems to be
waning rather than gathering strength.'' And Pepperdine University,
a firmly Christian institution in Malibu, Calif., which offered its
law school deanship to the Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth
Starr, is admired for having ``shown little interest in the current
radical trends in academe.''

MANY THINK KOHL'S HEIR WOULD RUN BETTER RACE

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   BONN, Germany _ In dire straits, a political party taps its most
popular figure to lead the campaign to cling to power. Right?
</P>
<P>
   Wrong, at least in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   As this country heads for a national election on Sept. 27 that
will chart its course into the 21st century, the focus for many
people is on whether Chancellor Helmut Kohl _ Europe's most durable
statesman _ will survive.
</P>
<P>
   Behind him, though, there is a figure far less known outside
Germany, but just as familiar to Germans, Wolfgang Schaeuble. He is
distinguished not simply because he is the only leading German
politician to operate from a wheelchair, but also because the same
opinion surveys that forecast defeat for Kohl define Schaeuble as
the man who would have been most likely to succeed in a
head-to-head challenge with Gerhard Schroeder, the opposition
contender for power in the election.
</P>
<P>
   The reform-minded and energetic Schaeuble is Kohl's crown
prince, a loyalist since the 1970s within the dominant Christian
Democrats. He was anointed by the chancellor last year as his
favored heir and has given sharp-tongued responses to those who
doubt his energies or suggest that physical disability might thwart
ambition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can a cripple become chancellor?'' he asked bluntly in an
interview last year, suggesting that he might seek the position at
some point despite the disability imposed on him by an assailant in
1990. ``I probably would not resist the temptation.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many inside and outside Kohl's party have suggested that
Schaeuble should have been the Christian Democrat to meet the most
serious challenge from the opposition Social Democrats in years.
And during the campaign, the underlying rivalry between the men has
bubbled forth in what seemed a brutal put-down by Kohl.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, Schaeuble delicately but unmistakably addressed an
issue that underpins German political calculations: Is Kohl
campaigning with a secret agenda in mind, seeking re-election as a
short-term chancellor, only to hand over to Schaeuble if he wins?
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a candidate for this legislative period,'' Kohl snapped
back, referring to the four-year terms to which German victors are
usually heir. ``Full stop, finish, over,'' he said. His reasoning
is that, as he said in earlier remarks, ``I can do it best.''
</P>
<P>
   But, at 68, Kohl also seems to be running against generational
currents that would give Schaeuble, 56, an edge in the contest with
the Social Democrat challenger, Schroeder, who is 54.
</P>
<P>
   So what does Schaeuble think? The answers, provided in an
interview in his parliamentary office before the latest brouhaha,
indicate that the crown prince is torn, neither easy in the role
Kohl has marked out for him nor prepared for the ultimate
disloyalty to his mentor.
</P>
<P>
   ``A leader who has ruled for 16 years has a certain appearance
of tiredness, but there are a lot of arguments that speak for Kohl
at a time when many of my compatriots are fearful of change,'' he
said, evoking the fatigue factor that many Christian Democrats
prefer not to mention in public discussions of Kohl.
</P>
<P>
   But ``if you look at all the arguments, then you come to the
conclusion that it was right to have Kohl,'' Schaeuble said,
suggesting more of an internal debate over the candidacy than had
been publicly known.
</P>
<P>
   Schaeuble's wheelchair is seen by some analysts as an obstacle
to popular acceptance of him in the top job. Others maintain that
the force of his personality offsets any doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The disability has brought positive sympathies,'' said Richard
Hilmer, a poll taker in Berlin. ``And what's recognizable from
opinion surveys is that there's no hesitation about having a
disabled person as chancellor.''
</P>
<P>
   Schaeuble has been paralyzed from the waist down since he was
shot on Oct. 12, 1990, by Dieter Kaufmann, who thought he was being
persecuted by the government.
</P>
<P>
   A fast-talking politician, educated in law and economics,
Schaeuble had played a high-profile role in negotiating the terms
of German unification in October 1990. He had acquired an image as
an adroit political manager, party arm-twister, conciliator and
rising star, respected even outside his own party.
</P>
<P>
   In Schaeuble's relationship with Kohl, there is something of the
good cop-bad cop. ``Kohl for the heart, Schaeuble for the mind,''
Michael Backhaus wrote in The Berliner Morgenpost.
</P>
<P>
   There is one way that Schaeuble could emerge as Germany's leader
earlier than Kohl seems ready to acknowledge as he campaigns for an
unprecedented fifth term.
</P>
<P>
   The September vote could force the Christian Democrats and
Social Democrats to form a ``grand coalition'' similar to those
that have governed Germany twice in the postwar period. In that
case, Kohl has said, he would not serve. Schaeuble would be the
obvious Christian Democrat choice to head one.

 &HT;    DELL ANNOUNCES $90 MILLION EXPANSION IN IRELAND
 &HT;    With IRELAND-CLINTON-0906.
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (f) Financial
categories.

   LIMERICK, Ireland _ Prompted by its stunning success in Europe,
Dell Computer Corp. plans to open a third manufacturing plant in
Ireland, a $90 million development expected to create 1,700 jobs,
the company said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In an announcement timed to coincide with President Clinton's
visit here, Jan Gesmar-Larsen, Dell's president for Europe, the
Middle East and Africa, said the expansion would make the company
the largest information technology employer in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The construction of the third manufacturing facility will take
the scale of Dell's operations in Ireland to a new level,''
Gesmar-Larsen said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to a rally in the city center, Clinton personally
expressed his gratitude to the Austin, Texas-based company for its
contribution to the Irish economy, which he has described as ``the
Celtic tiger.'' During his three-day visit here, the president has
said that economic development in the Irish Republic has been key
to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very proud that an American company, Dell Computers, has
been able to play such a strong role in this progress,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dell already employs more than 1,500 workers here and expects to
raise that total to more than 3,000 over the next year. The new
plant is expected to open in late 1999, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The company decided to expand in Limerick because of the quality
of the Irish workforce, Gesmar-Larsen said.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Dell purchased a 340,000-square-foot manufacturing
site nearby. The company opened its first plant in 1990, and a
second manufacturing site has been operational since April. The
company also has a sales and support call center in suburban
Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   Dell founder Michael Dell recently called Ireland ``the backbone
of Dell's infrastructure in Europe'' -- which provides nearly 25
percent of Dell's annual revenues, and is crucial to its ambitions
to become the world's No. 1 computer maker.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the decision to make the expansion was supported by
increased demand from business customers in Europe, the Middle East
and Africa, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter of 1998. the Dell unit here reported a
year-on-year growth of 87 percent -- a rate that outpaced the rest
of the European market by almost five times. Dell is the No. 2
personal computer company in Europe in terms of revenue and units
shipped. The firm is the No. 1 personal computer company in
Ireland, with a 26 percent share of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Also Saturday, Dell said it would contribute 100 computers to
the community of Omagh, Northern Ireland, where a car bomb
detonated on a busy market street last month killed 29 people and
injured 500 more. The company said it would work with local
authorities to distribute the equipment.

   SUNDAY MARKETS PACKAGE
</P>
<P>
   The AJC is offering a package for this Sunday examining whether
the stock market volatility has altered consumer behavior, as well
as the plans of businesses that are directly affected by the whims
of consumers. Early reporting indicates that consumer confidence is
eroding, but other forces are probably more important than concerns
about the market. There's no doubt, however, that the market news
will reinforce some negative trends that were already at work. A
CoxNet repackaged page has been created and posted on the Cox
server. Please call CoxNet at 404-526-5456.

   PRISONER-BERENSON _ MIAMI _ ``President Clinton visited with
Monica Lewinsky on 37 occasions, but he can't see us once,'' said
Mark Berenson, his voice trembling with anger. For the last two and
a half years, the New Yorker and his wife, Rhoda Berenson, have
worked to free their daughter, Lori Berenson, from a windowless
prison some 500 miles outside Lima, Peru, where she's serving a
life sentence for treason. The 28-year-old MIT graduate was
convicted in 1996 of plotting to take over Peru's Congress by
hooded judges during a secret trial. The Berensons have tried
repeatedly to see Clinton, who has asked Peruvian President Alberto
Fujimori to review their daughter's case. I will visit in New York
with the couple, who will be just back from a visit with their
daughter at the prison, located 12,700 feet above sea level. I will
also visit with other members of Lori Berenson's family, who live

IT'S PAULA JONES, GOP FUND-RAISER 
DEMOCRATS' WORRY: GREEN, GREEN, GONE 
CALIFORNIA PONDERS QUESTION OF THE MONTH
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The way Steve Arnold, a Republican from High Point, N.C., saw
it, his campaign to win another term on the Guilford County Board
of Commissioners needed a lift.
</P>
<P>
   What to do?
</P>
<P>
   Then it hit him.
</P>
<P>
   He would ask Paula Jones to be the featured attraction at an
October fund-raiser. What Republican fat cat, or thin cat, could
resist a chance to chat up President Clinton's accuser?
</P>
<P>
   ``Paula Jones,'' Arnold said the other day, ``is an
all-American, middle-class wife and mother whose only crime was to
be seen and approached by Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jones makes few, if any, political appearances, although to
hear Clinton's defenders tell it, her whole life in recent years
has been one big political appearance.
</P>
<P>
   But in any event, when Arnold, the Republican nominee for
lieutenant governor of North Carolina in 1996, proffered an
invitation, she accepted _ for a fee (which was not made public),
travel expenses and an all-expenses-paid vacation in the North
Carolina mountains for her, her husband, Steve, and their two
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can use the money and the break, because neither Paula
nor Steve has a job right now,'' said Nisha Mohammed of the
Rutherford Institute, the conservative advocacy group in
Charlottesville, Va., that has helped Mrs. Jones with her sexual
harassment suit against the president and manages her public
relations.
</P>
<P>
   How does all this strike Arnold's Democratic opponent, Mary Anne
Busch?
</P>
<P>
   She says she'll stick with local issues and local money-raisers
and leave the political hoopla to Arnold and Mrs. Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats' Worry: Green, Green, Gone
</P>
<P>
   With their appeal to hard-core environmentalists,
counterculturists and other hard-left voters, Green Party
candidates sometimes find themselves in position to swing elections
or otherwise make political mischief. So while they seldom win
office, they more than once have kept others from winning, or have
come close to keeping others from winning _ mainly Democrats who
strayed too far to the right to hold the Green vote.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that Bob Anderson, the Green candidate for Congress in
New Mexico's 1st District, got a call the other night from House
Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, who had a favor to ask.
</P>
<P>
   But first some political history.
</P>
<P>
   The 1st is one of the Republican-held districts that Democrats
have been closely eyeing this year as a prime takeover target.
Covering mainly the city of Albuquerque, it has a good number of
Democratic voters, and the incumbent representative, Heather
Wilson, has been in office only since June, when she narrowly won a
special election.
</P>
<P>
   Her Democratic opponent in June, as in this fall's race, was
state Sen. Phil Maloof. He would have won the June contest, many
political pros say, had not a third-party candidate siphoned off a
large number of Democratic votes, perhaps 10 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   That candidate: Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt asked Anderson to consider withdrawing from the fall
race, lest the political scenario of the June race be repeated.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, an instructor at the University of New Mexico,
refused. ``We're committed,'' he told Gephardt, adding that a few
days earlier he had also turned down a direct appeal from Maloof to
withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   Why, the minority leader wanted to know?
</P>
<P>
   Anderson explained that the ``fundamental'' reason he was
running was that Maloof and the Democratic Party had drifted ``too
far to the right.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt countered that the Greens would get far more out of a
district and a House controlled by Democrats than a district and a
House controlled by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was still not moved.
</P>
<P>
   The Greens, he told Gephardt, were ``a movement to empower
people'' and return ``some sanity'' to politics.
</P>
<P>
   California Ponders Question of the Month
</P>
<P>
   If Gov. Pete Wilson signs a bill sent to him by the California
Legislature, the 2000 presidential primary in the nation's most
populous state will be held on March 7 instead of in early June, as
in most years past. And if that happens, March 7, 2000, could turn
out to be one dilly of a day in American politics.
</P>
<P>
   By advancing its primary date, California, with its
biggest-of-all trove of convention delegates, almost certainly
could add to its influence in the candidate-picking process. That
influence has waned in recent years because the state, with one
exception, has stuck with its June voting date while many other
states have hastened to hold their primaries in early March _ the
result being that nominees are now often known well before June and
all remaining primaries are moot.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, candidates and voters are complaining that they
feel rushed and shortchanged by the primary front-loading. Some
election officials and national party leaders agree and are pushing
for a series of spread-out regional Super Tuesday primaries, to go
into effect after the 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   But in the meantime, as California demonstrates, the
front-loading rush continues.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson says he has some doubts about advancing the primary date,
because not only would California then be contributing to the rush
but, worse, such a move might set off a wild, willy-nilly stampede
to hold early regional primaries in 2000, with most regions going
for the March 7 date, lest their influence be marginalized.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of uncoordinated, every-region-for-itself scramble
conceivably could see both presidential nominees chosen in a single
day _ history in the making, for sure.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for all his concerns about the wisdom of an early
California primary, Wilson might be tempted to sign the bill before
him. He's thinking about running again in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   There is another political catch in all of this.
</P>
<P>
   California has a new law that says all primaries are to be
``open,'' meaning Republicans can vote for Democrats, Democrats for
independents, and so forth. But under national party rules, only
``closed'' primaries, in which Democrats vote for Democrats, etc.,
may be used to choose presidential delegates.
</P>
<P>
   So whatever the date of the next California primary, the state
has a problem. It must return to its old closed system of electing
delegates or it risks having them not seated.
</P>
<P>
   A proposal to do that will be on the fall ballot. But early
polls indicate that the measure's proponents will have to work
extra hard to get it passed.

AMORY BRADFORD, 85, FORMER N.Y. TIMES GENERAL MANAGER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., S.C., Mass., R.I., Calif.)   (bl)  
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amory H. Bradford, a former vice president and general manager
of The New York Times who was the chief negotiator for the
Publishers Association in the bruising 114-day New York newspaper
strike in 1962-63, died Saturday at his home in Edisto Beach, S.C.
He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   A Yale-educated Wall Street lawyer, Bradford joined The Times in
1947 as a special assistant to the publisher, Arthur Hays
Sulzberger, and over the next 16 years became a company director,
The Times' business manager and general manager and an important
member of management.
</P>
<P>
   Long before satellites and computers, former associates recalled
Saturday, Bradford had visions of The Times as an economically
strong newspaper of global influence, with editions in Paris for
European consumption and on the West Coast for what was to be the
start of a nationwide readership.
</P>
<P>
   Allying himself with Orvil E. Dryfoos, Sulzberger's son-in-law,
who became publisher in 1961, Bradford engineered the company's
purchase of Gaspesia Pulp &AMP; Paper Co. in Canada to ensure newsprint
supplies. He also saw cost-saving automation as the economic wave
of the future, and he regarded unions, inefficiency and low
productivity as roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1960s, he had become chairman of the New York City
Publishers Association, made up of the city's eight major
newspapers, and was president of the New York Regional Plan
Association. He had also launched The Times' short-lived
international edition, had formulated plans for its West Coast
edition, and appeared to have positioned himself for The Times'
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But his personal and professional ambitions finally hit a rock.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 8, 1962, the printers' union launched what was to be the
longest and costliest strike in New York newspaper history, a
114-day marathon. The Publishers Association chose Bradford as its
point man in negotiations with Typographical Union No. 6 and its
president, Bertram A. Powers.
</P>
<P>
   They were natural enemies from the start. Powers, a high school
dropout, was a tough, relentless negotiatator, the embodiment of a
gut-fighter up from the streets. Bradford, an Ivy League
aristocrat, impeccably dressed and 6 feet 4 inches tall, was
accustomed to snapping orders at pliant subordinates.
</P>
<P>
   As the strike dragged on, it became increasingly clear to
insiders that the clash of two personalities was prolonging the
controversy; the publishers began to have doubts about Bradford.
</P>
<P>
   When the walkout ended on April 1, 1963, The Times published a
two-page account by A.H. Raskin, its labor reporter. Only a few
paragraphs were devoted to Bradford, but they were damaging. In his
memoirs, ``My Life and The Times,'' Turner Catledge, for many years
The Times' chief news executive, said Bradford had gone to him and
to Dryfoos to try to get the article suppressed. ``He made it clear
he did not want the story published, or least those portions about
him,'' Catledge related. But the article was published.
</P>
<P>
   After calling Bradford ``handsome, articulate and aloof,''
Raskin wrote: ``One top-level mediator said Mr. Bradford brought an
attitude of such icy disdain into the conference rooms that the
mediator often felt he ought to ask the hotel to send up more heat.
Another mediator, who called Mr. Bradford the possessor of the
keenest mind on the management side, said he operates on a `short
fuse.'''
</P>
<P>
   The publishers admired Bradford's ``independence and
assurance,'' but ``they are occasionally galled by his
imperiousness,'' Raskin added.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, Dryfoos died, and Bradford's hopes for the
presidency faded. On June 20, 1963, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger was
named president and publisher of The Times, and Bradford issued a
statement saying he was ``not in agreement with the proposed plan
of reorganization,'' and resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Amory Howe Bradford was born in Springfield, Mass., on Oct. 1,
1912, the son of a Congregational minister, and grew up in Rutland,
Vt., and Providence, R.I. He graduated from Phillips Academy in
Andover, Mass., in 1930, Yale in 1934 and Yale Law School in 1937.
He practiced law with Davis, Polk Wardwell &AMP; Reed in New York for a
decade, except for Army intelligence service in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving The Times in 1963, he was a consultant to the Ford
Foundation for programs in Greece, Turkey, Switzerland and Italy,
and in 1964 he became an executive with Scripps-Howard Newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, he was appointed by the U.S. Commerce Department to set
up a $23 million program that created 3,000 jobs in Oakland,
Calif., a city of hard-core unemployment. Drawing on the
experience, he wrote a novel, ``Oakland's Not For Burning'' (David
McKay, 1968).
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Bradford headed a Nixon administration study group that
designed and recommended the new federal Environmental Protection
Agency in the form that was accepted by the president and Congress.
He later called it his most satisfying accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   In later years, Bradford acknowledged having become a jobless
alcoholic, and confided to friends that he once came close to
suicide. But he began psychiatric treatment, quit drinking and
radically changed his lifestyle. He began studying massage and
psychotherapy at the Esalen Institute in Big Sur, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   From 1978 to 1982, Bradford lived in a van, traveling in the
United States, Canada and Mexico, occasionally revisiting the
Esalen Institute for seminars. He practiced gestalt therapy in
Arlington, Vt., from 1982 to 1987. He and his wife, Laurene, also
taught massage.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, he had been writing his memoirs. In a statement
he composed for his own obituary, he said that his ``final years
were intensified by the practice of Siddha Yoga meditation, taught
by Swami Muktananda, to whom he was introduced by his daughter,
Madhavi, in 1976.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife, Bradford is survived by three daughters,
Carola Lea, of Lyme, N.H., Madhavi Bradford, of Carbondale, Colo.,
Deborah Bradford, of Aspen, Colo.; two sons, Peter, of Peru, Vt.,
and David, of Brattleboro, Vt.; his first wife and the mother of
his five children, Carol Noyes, of Syosset, N.Y.; a sister, Jean
Page, of Concord, N.H.; a brother, Allyn Bradford, of Cambridge,
Mass.; two stepdaughters, Rebecca Waggoner, of Walnut Creek,
Calif., and Kate Dow, of Rutland, Vt., and eight grandchildren.

HOMETOWN APPLAUDS SENATOR'S SCOLDING OF CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN _ Sen. Joseph Lieberman's hometown reacted with relief
to his extraordinary rebuke of President Clinton on the floor of
the Senate on Thursday, with both Democrats and Republicans saying
that he spoke for them, and that it was about time someone did.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Charleston, 53, a bus driver for Connecticut Transit who
voted for Clinton twice, said he watched the speech live on CNN,
flipped the channels to catch clips Friday morning, then listened
to talk shows discuss it as he drove to the start of his route.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good that a Democrat gave that speech, because
everybody's going to try to use what Clinton did to hold the
Democrats down,'' Charleston said. ``I was wondering when Lieberman
was going to speak up. He spoke for Connecticut.''
</P>
<P>
   From a working-class diner to the gabled grandeur of Yale
University, most people interviewed here Friday said that for all
the talk about Clinton's admission of an inappropriate relationship
with Monica Lewinsky, Lieberman's measured condemnation of the
president was about the most sensible thing they had heard on the
topic. In his 24-minute speech, Lieberman, a centrist Democrat and
longtime ally of the president, called Clinton's actions
``disgraceful,'' ``immoral,'' and `` harmful, for it sends a
message of what is acceptable behavior to the larger American
family _ particularly to our children.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Clinton said he ``basically'' agreed with Lieberman
and said he was ``very sorry'' about his relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Several longtime Connecticut residents said Lieberman's speech
reminded them of the repudiation of President Richard Nixon by
another senator from Connecticut, Lowell Weicker Jr., during the
Watergate scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Weicker, who was then a Republican, was defeated by Lieberman in
1988 and later, as an independent, became Connecticut's governor.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Geisler, 55, a lawyer who was headed to his broker Friday
to pick up a check from stocks he had just sold, recalled the
string of Republican leaders who had urged Nixon to resign ``when
the evidence became too overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like it's beginning to head in the same direction,''
said Geisler, who said he had voted for Clinton in 1992 and Ralph
Nader in 1996. ``This is so serious that it transcends party.''
</P>
<P>
   Interest in the speech was especially keen at Yale, where
Lieberman earned his undergraduate degree in 1964 and graduated
from the law school in 1967, six years ahead of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Melanie Harris, a sophomore from New Rochelle, N.Y., who is
majoring in film studies, said the speech made her feel better
about being a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes it from being a party issue and makes it an
individual issue,'' she said. ``Democrats can disagree with what
Clinton did and still be Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   What was most clear from random conversations in this city of
124,000 is that, regardless of what people tell pollsters, they
love to talk about all matters related to Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In several cases, people were so eager to vent that they rushed
up and interrupted total strangers. Some pantomimed the president's
famous finger-wagging denial in January, and lively disputes
erupted over gift ties and stained dresses.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At Cody's 24-hour diner on Water Street, several customers said
that the speech by Lieberman portends peril for the president. ``He
just got the ball rolling,'' said Joseph Balzano, 36, a truck
driver and stagehand who said he is a registered Democrat but votes
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   A waitress, Mary Ann Severino, 60, chipped in with her view that
Lieberman's speech was one more betrayal in a drama that has
featured way too many. ``He was a hypocrite to Clinton,'' she said.
``If he was a good friend, he wouldn't have done that. He just
wants the public _ what's the word? _ on his side.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides, who had implored Lieberman to cancel or
postpone his planned remarks, would perhaps be surprised to hear
the view of John Burnham, a retired curator of Yale's numismatics
collection, that the address was ``an easy shot'' that could have
been orchestrated by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you strip away all the ornateness, there's not much
there,'' said Burnham, a Republican. ``In the end, it probably
helps you-know-who to bounce back. It's going to be worked on a
sympathy basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Among some, there was surprise that the speech was treated as
such a momentous occasion in Washington. Here, many people know the
senator as ``Joe,'' someone they see at the Little League field,
and they felt that his words were obvious at this point.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't say anything that anybody else didn't say, but he
came right out and said it,'' said David Munsill, 59, an
electrician.
</P>
<P>
   Where most saw courage, a few saw sanctimony. Marcus Little, a
telephone repairman who was walking a picket line at a Southern New
England Telecommunications Corp. garage here, scoffed at ``the
righteous Joe Lieberman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't mind telling you what your opinion should be,''
said Little, 28, a Democrat. ``He had appointed himself the savior
of all Connecticut. Now he's working on the whole country.''

AS NYC GROWS SAFER, CRIME LOOSENS ITS GRIP ON THE NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALAN FINDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was a slow news day in the depths of summer.
Thirteen Ohio factory workers had won a $296 million lottery. The
Hamptons were gearing up for a visit by the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   WCBS-TV, Channel 2 in New York City, chose a different story to
lead its 6 p.m. newscast on July 30: Seven women had been harassed
over the previous two months on a jogging path in Westchester
County. Once, a man fondled himself as a woman passed by. Several
other times, someone tried without success to grab one of the
women, the station reported.
</P>
<P>
   Since no one had been hurt or arrested (police were not even
sure if they had one or several suspects), the incidents might seem
an odd choice as the top news in the nation's largest city. In the
early 1990s, when the New York crime rate was much higher, the
report would have been unlikely to make the broadcast, much less
lead it.
</P>
<P>
   The selection reflects some of the significant changes on New
York's television news broadcasts and in its newspapers as the
city's crime rate has dropped for the last half-dozen years. The
crime stories reported by the local news organizations these days
are noticeably different, having a greater emphasis on sexual
attacks and child abuse. There are more reports on crimes in the
suburbs and the outer reaches of the region, as well as stepped-up
coverage of the inner workings of the Police Department itself,
including police misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   But it is in the sheer numbers of reports about crime _
particularly in New York City's three major daily newspapers _
where change is most pronounced. In the first two weeks of May
1994, for example, there were 120 articles on crimes in the city in
The New York Daily News, The New York Post and The New York Times.
In the first two weeks of May this year, there were only a third as
many articles about crime in the three newspapers: 44 altogether,
including several on crimes in the suburbs. On many days in May,
there was no crime news at all in The Daily News or The Post, where
once it was a staple.
</P>
<P>
   On local television news, which has been criticized for years
for its daily diet of murder and mayhem, there appears to be a
reduction as well, though much more modest. It is impossible to
quantify, because news directors at New York's major network-owned
stations refused to make available videotapes or written records of
old broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   There is no rigorous independent survey that analyzed the
contents of local news four or more years ago. But many current and
former television news executives say that for many years at least
30 percent to 40 percent of the reports on local newscasts were
about crime. The New York Times analyzed 20 news broadcasts on the
three network-owned stations with the largest audiences _WCBS-TV,
WNBC-TV and WABC-TV _ over four weeks this summer, and crime was
the subject of 27 percent of the reports.
</P>
<P>
   On some evenings, reports about crime represented a majority of
the reports on local news shows, and many minutes of air time at
the start of the broadcasts were devoted to them. But on other
nights, crime news was relatively brief and came late in the shows.
</P>
<P>
   These changes are largely a consequence of the remarkable
decline of violent crime in New York, where the number of killings
has diminished from 2,245 in 1990 to 767 last year. At the current
rate, there would be fewer than 600 this year, the lowest total in
three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Alterations in news coverage also reflect deliberate decisions,
especially by people who manage local television news operations,
to adjust somewhat the tone and content of their daily reports.
``There is a positive feeling overall, and I think reporters and
editors come into the workplace feeling that, because we all live
in the same community,'' said WCBS-TV news director Bill Carey.
``We look for stories that are relevant to the life that we live.''
</P>
<P>
   Many reporters and editors say the changes are also the result
of police department policies that make it more difficult to get
information on crime and access to police officials.
</P>
<P>
   Six or seven years ago, when there were nearly six killings a
day in New York City, on average, the basic question for crime
reporters was which of the grisly homicides to cover. There was
seldom time to report on other kinds of crime or on the Police
Department as an institution. Crime news often crowded out other
subjects on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, there is less and less crime that is worthy of any
coverage,'' said Bart Feder, news director at Channel 7, WABC-TV.
``This is an opportunity to fill the shows in a more interesting
and diverse way. I think there is more commitment at all the
stations to enterprise reporting, to investigative reporting, to
honest-to-goodness journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Feder's counterparts at other New York City stations offer the
same assessment, and on some nights there is evidence to buttress
their view. But careful viewing of the 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. news
shows also offered considerable evidence to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   Some nights, local stations compensate for the murder gap by
covering crimes committed in other places and by reporting on local
crimes that, not long ago, would have passed unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, for example, Channel 7 sent a reporter to
Westchester for a long piece on the expanded use of unmarked police
cars on highways to counter road rage. Local stations also reported
in recent weeks on the arrest of a man in Freehold, N.J., accused
of stabbing his wife, a sexual assault on an employee of a Bronx
motel and a double homicide in Bayonne, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   But there were also recent examples of more ambitious journalism
on local stations, reports on serious subjects that might have had
difficulty getting on the air when television news was overwhelmed
by body bags.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 28, Channel 4 broadcast a long report on how the stock
market's slide might affect New York City's budget. The previous
week, a Channel 4 reporter assessed the accuracy of campaign
advertisements by Democratic candidates for governor and the U.S.
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many journalism professors and critics contend there is still
too much crime on local television. ``There's no question that it
is still the predominant item,'' said David Klatell, head of the
broadcast program at Columbia University's Graduate School of
Journalism. ``Television news has always been a much more emotive
and emotional medium than a logical one, and so the fear of crime
persists even if the reality doesn't. It's much easier to cover
crime than to cover the school system or race relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Klatell worked with a group of academic researchers who began to
study the content of local television news two years ago. They
analyzed broadcasts in eight cities on four nights during the
1996-1997 television season. The survey showed that 27.2 percent of
the air time on New York City newscasts was devoted to crime, well
above the eight-city average of 20.2 percent. A similar analysis of
the television season that ended last spring is not finished.
</P>
<P>
   Some former broadcast executives credit NY1 News, the all-news
cable station, with influencing coverage on the larger
network-owned stations. Since it started in 1992, NY1 has tried to
balance crime news with beat reporting on everything from
government and schools to the subway and neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Paulus, the senior vice president for news at NY1, said
that his station was devoting less time to crime these days.
``Where a police reporter would have covered the crime of the
day,'' he said, ``the police reporter is now more likely to be
covering police department issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, the reduced crime rate may sometimes cause
journalists to react more strongly to major crimes. The decline in
crime means that ``those that do occur take on a prominence, seem
more newsworthy than they did in the past,'' said Daily News
managing editor Arthur Browne. ``There is an added shock value now
when they happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Many reporters who regularly cover the police say that another
factor in the decline of crime news is that the police share
information less readily and are generally less cooperative. Some
police reporters said that they could usually get enough
information to report breaking crime news, but that it was often
difficult if not impossible to learn enough for analytic or other
enterprise articles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This administration has made a concerted drive to keep bad
news out of the papers and off the screen,'' said Gabe Pressman,
the veteran television reporter who is president of the New York
Press Club.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it is by design or by chance, the decrease of crime news
in the city's papers is startling. On May 4, for example, there was
a single crime article in The Daily News, buried deep on page 24: a
13-year-old Long Island boy had been shot in the shoulder by a
stray bullet, possibly from a nearby shooting range. The Times, in
its local pages, had one reference to crime: a few sentences on a
sexual abuse case in Syracuse. The following day, there were no
reports on crime in The News, The Times or The Post. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On May 6, there was one article in The Post, on page 7, about
the arrest of a substitute teacher in Queens accused of hitting
students with a chair. The News put the same story on page 8, next
to an article about an investigation into whether police officers
had covered up for an off-duty detective involved in a car crash.
The Times carried an article on the substitute teacher on page B1.
</P>
<P>
   That week, and the following one, the front pages of New York's
tabloids _ where crime once was king _ were taken up with the
Knicks' playoff chances, new cancer drugs and the final episode of
``Seinfeld.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are really two possible explanations for this,'' said
Mitchell Stephens, acting chairman of the journalism department at
New York University. ``One is that the reality has changed and news
reflects reality. I tend to doubt that. The other is that
competitive organizational pressures in the news business are
responsible for the waxing and waning of crime coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephens, who has a new book on video and television called
``The Rise of the Image the Fall of the Word,'' said the arrival of
New York Newsday in the 1980s led to a brutal circulation war in
the city. In time-honored American fashion, he said, newspapers
sought circulation by concentrating on crime. The death of New York
Newsday eased the circulation wars, he said, reducing pressure on
editors to pursue crime.
</P>
<P>
   Stephens also offered a second theory for the diminished
attention to crime by the New York news organizations. ``Maybe
people are feeling less paranoid,'' he said, ``and it is harder to
push those buttons.''

MANY BOATS BUT FEW RULES AS NYC WATERWAYS GET BUSIER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Even on the only cloudy day last week, the waters in
and around New York City teemed with boats of every description.
</P>
<P>
   A speedboat towed a soaring parachutist past the Statue of
Liberty while several sea kayaks bobbed near the World Trade
Center. The Chelsea Screamer, a 50-foot orange ocean-racing power
boat for hire, spewed a rooster tail of foam as it roared past an
antique schooner setting sail on a lunch-time cruise near Battery
Park.
</P>
<P>
   And as tugboats pushed two hulking black barges up the Hudson,
ferries large and small wove their way between New Jersey and
Manhattan, carrying thousands of commuters.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the growing tangle of cargo craft, pleasure boats and
commuter vessels in the busiest harbor on the East Coast, Coast
Guard and New York City police officials say the waters here have
remained remarkably safe.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, there are signs of trouble on the water, with
some people who frequent the harbor and the Hudson saying the area
is getting too popular, too fast. The rise in boating activity,
they say, may be close to outstripping the resources of federal and
local marine-safety officials, whose budgets are flat or shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now, the waterways have been like an empty street,''
said Tom Fox, the owner of New York Water Taxi, which has
commissioned several new ferries that are to begin service around
lower Manhattan next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's filled with the equivalent of bicycles,
Rollerbladers, trucks, cars, buses. As it gets busier and busier,
that's going to present a real challenge to public safety.''
</P>
<P>
   After five years with no more than one boating fatality in a
single year, so far this year three people have died in New York
City waters, according to the Police Department Harbor Unit.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths include a Bronx man who fell out of his inflatable
runabout near Pelham Park last Tuesday and died when the boat's
propeller struck his head.
</P>
<P>
   On July 26, two jet skis collided in Orchard Beach, and one of
the drivers died two weeks later. Jet skis are now considered the
most serious problem on the water, accounting for nearly 30 percent
of accidents across the state even though they are only 10 percent
of the total fleet of pleasure craft, said Capt. John Cassidy, the
commander of New York City's 150-member Harbor Unit.
</P>
<P>
   The third death occurred when a biologist drowned near the
George Washington Bridge while hauling nets in a small boat at
night as part of a research project.
</P>
<P>
   Further afield, accidents on private and commercial craft are
also making headlines. Two weeks ago, near the Tappan Zee Bridge, a
water taxi that lacked a valid Coast Guard certificate capsized on
its way from Nyack to Tarrytown while carrying eight more people
than its legal limit. One elderly passenger died, four others were
hospitalized and half a dozen children were pulled from the water
by frantic parents fighting for their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard officials say their spot checks and inspections have
helped keep such incidents rare. But in response to the budget
cuts, the agency has been encouraging passengers on water taxis and
ferries to pitch in by scrutinizing the boats they board _ checking
for certificates, licensed captains, the proper number of
passengers and well-labeled life jacket bins, among other things _
and calling the authorities if something appears awry.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, spot checks of ferries and pleasure boats by
the Coast Guard are backed up by patrols and inspections by the
police harbor patrols.
</P>
<P>
   Cassidy said that three years ago his unit began compiling
profiles of every ferry, water taxi, dinner-cruise boat and other
commercial vessel in city waters to aid in spotting safety
violations.
</P>
<P>
   But the Coast Guard and police inspection units are operating
with budgets that have not increased for several years.
</P>
<P>
   A General Accounting Office report last year on the Coast Guard
concluded that budget cuts earmarked by the Office of Management
and Budget would require significant reductions in services,
probably including unpopular measures like closing some rescue
stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since fiscal year 1992, the Coast Guard has assumed increased
responsibilities while shrinking its work force by nearly 10
percent and operating with a budget that has risen about 1 percent
a year in actual dollars,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   And the number of commercial craft continues to rise. Before
1986, small commercial water taxis and ferries in New York Harbor
for commuters were unknown, said Alan Olmsted, the director of the
City Transportation Department's office of private ferry
operations.
</P>
<P>
   But since then the number of passengers carried by ferry and
taxi fleets has grown quickly _ with average weekday ridership in
the summer rising from around 4,000 passengers a day in 1988 to
nearly 30,000 today, Olmsted said.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial ferries, numbering in the dozens, are relatively
easy to monitor, officials say. Far more challenging is the
thickening small-boat traffic. Only boats with motors are
registered by the state, and private pleasure craft undergo no
regular inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the rise in jet ski collisions, the police have
adopted new patrol tactics. Jet skis, which are concentrated mainly
in places like Jamaica Bay, Orchard Beach and City Island, are now
being tracked by a seven-member task force using their own jet skis
and unmarked speedboats, Cassidy said. A new state law enacted this
summer will require that jet ski operators take classes. But other
small craft, like kayaks and canoes, are virtually unregulated.
</P>
<P>
   Several sea kayaking businesses have opened along the West Side
in recent years and are quickly growing. The kayak concession at
the Chelsea Piers Sports Center ``is booming,'' said Fred Greco,
the center's athletic coordinator. ``We started our mailing list at
250 in January and have 600 names right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The kayaks, which ride low in the water and often cross shipping
channels to visit the Statue of Liberty, are a growing concern to
tug boat operators and pilots who shepherd barges and freighters
around the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   With more and more kayaks, sailboats, rowing skiffs and other
pleasure craft appearing along Manhattan's West Side piers,
representatives of the shipping industry are calling for a kind of
zoning for harbor waters, placing busy shipping channels off-limits
to pleasure craft.
</P>
<P>
   The zoning proposal has been a hot topic at meetings of the
Harbor Safety, Navigation and Operations Committee, a group
representing harbor businesses and marine-safety agencies that is
trying to work out a long-term plan for avoiding accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Committee chairman Andrew McGovern, a veteran harbor pilot, said
that something must be done or an increase in accidents is
inevitable. ``The Coast Guard says the waterways are open to all,''
McGovern said. ``That may be true, but there has to be some logic.
You're not allowed to take a bicycle on a railroad track, or a
horse on a highway.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent close call just a few miles north of the George
Washington Bridge illustrates the potential for disaster. Andrew
Hudak, 60, a carpenter from Yonkers, paddled out that night to
enjoy the rising full moon from his 15-foot white canoe.
</P>
<P>
   He had been canoeing on the river for more than 11 years, never
missing a month in that time, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As he headed east across the river at 10 p.m., following the
glimmering trail of moonlight, he heard an approaching roar.
</P>
<P>
   He could see a speedboat coming, and the craft seemed to veer to
the right to avoid him, he said. But then it veered left. ``The
next thing I know is an explosion,'' he said. ``I'm underwater
trying to figure out if I'm alive.''
</P>
<P>
   The boat circled back, picked up Hudak and the two pieces of his
neatly sliced canoe, and headed to shore to get an ambulance and
the police. Hudak escaped with just a bruised ankle. No charges
were filed against him or the operator of the speedboat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my fault,'' Hudak said. But he added that the river was
now so crowded with loud, fast craft that it is becoming more
difficult to avoid accidents.
</P>
<P>
   He said he planned to continue paddling on the Hudson, borrowing
a friend's canoe. But, he added, ``I don't think I'll be doing the
moon shot for awhile.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   During the past several days, record heat has scorched the
southern Plains and northern Texas with many locations exceeding
100 degrees. On Sunday, the clockwise circulation around high
pressure centered over Kentucky will push the unseasonable warmth
toward the Ohio Valley and Middle Atlantic States. Indeed, beneath
abundant sunshine, afternoon readings will reach the 90s from
southern Indiana to New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Breezes from the southwest will also direct dry and very warm
air into southern New England. Farther north and west, a cool front
sliding south from Canada will bring a few clouds and isolated
thundershowers to the southern Great Lakes and interior sections of
New England.
</P>
<P>
   Showers and thunderstorms will erupt along the central Gulf
coast and Florida on Sunday as a steady flow of tropical moisture
is drawn north from the Gulf of Mexico. Local rainfall tallies will
exceed an inch in many locations, which could cause minor flooding.
Farther west, sunny skies will once again promote torrid conditions
from Texas to Kansas. Meanwhile, spotty thundershowers will
accompany a cold front moving southward through the upper Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Residual moisture from former Hurricane Isis will ignite
numerous showers and thunderstorms over the interior West on
Sunday. Storms will be most numerous in the late afternoon as
uneven heating of the irregular terrain by the sun induces
fast-moving currents of ascending air. Elsewhere, onshore winds
will drive low clouds to coastal Washington and Oregon while the
interior Northwest stays mainly sunny and warm.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: RIP CURRENTS
</P>
<P>
   A steady onshore wind Saturday prompted warnings of rip currents
to swimmers along Florida's east coast. Because a wind-generated
wave rarely is of uniform height along its entire length, water
piles up near the shore where incoming waves are tallest. Water
sliding down both sides of the piles creates flows that move
parallel to the shore. Where these flows converge, water is
diverted seaward, creating a dangerous rip current that can push
swimmers into deep water. If caught in a rip current, it is wise to
swim parallel to the beach until out of the current and then swim
back to shore. &QL;

DENNIS GREEN'S DEAL A SIGN OF THE TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
  By MIKE FREEMAN   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Only several days ago, the acrimony between Minnesota Vikings
coach Dennis Green and the team's new owner, Red McCombs, seemed
thicker than cement. McCombs had rejected two contract proposals
from Green's agent, Ray Anderson, with the latest rejection coming
just last week. It increasingly looked like Green was going to
leave the Vikings at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Then Anderson received a shocking call from representatives of
McCombs on Wednesday _ they wanted to make a deal. For the next 48
hours the two sides hammered out an agreement and now Green has
what he wanted and what many around the National Football League
say he deserved: a long-term contract and security.
</P>
<P>
   Early Saturday, Green signed a multiyear extension that makes
him one of the richest coaches in the league. While exact figures
were unavailable, it is believed Green will earn at least $1.5
million a year. Despite one of the best track records of any active
coach, Green had been severely underpaid. He is 57-45 as coach of
the Vikings, has made the playoffs five of the past six years, won
two division titles, and last year led the Vikings over the Giants
in one of the biggest playoff comebacks in NFL history, yet his
$900,000 salary made him among the 10 lowest-paid coaches in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Green is the only coach in the National Football Conference
Central with a winning record against the Green Bay Packers in the
1990s, and he was still the lowest paid coach in the division,
earning even less than Chicago's Dave Wannstedt, who is scheduled
to make $1 million this season despite his 37-45 record.
</P>
<P>
   Green's huge salary bump is yet another indication that head
coaches are becoming wealthier and more powerful. One owner
estimates that coaching salaries have quadrupled in the past 10
years. Kansas City coach Marty Schottenheimer, who made less than
$400,000 as coach of the Cleveland Browns in 1988, now makes more
than $2 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches have become more powerful because they are required to
do more as free agency has changed football. Now, like never
before, players move from team to team in conveyor belt-like
fashion. For a team to have cohesion, a good coach must make all
that talent gel.
</P>
<P>
   Most teams recognize this. Denver Broncos coach Mike Shanahan
recently signed the richest head coaching contract in NFL history;
a deal that will pay him more than $2.4 million a season. According
to coaching salary information obtained from various sources,
Shanahan is among a growing number of coaches who will make at
least $2 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Others include Bill Parcells of the Jets ($2.4 million a
season), Mike Ditka of New Orleans ($2 million), and Jimmy Johnson
of Miami ($2 million).
</P>
<P>
   And those are just base salaries. In addition to receiving
bonuses for getting to a playoff or Super Bowl, coaches have
lucrative deals for local television and radio shows. Wannstedt and
Bill Cowher of Pittsburgh each receive $250,000 a year for media
rights and expenses; Johnson $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   The only coach in the NFL who is effectively working on a
one-year deal is Baltimore's Ted Marchibroda. Owner Art Modell said
he is open to giving Marchibroda an extension and since the Ravens
will probably have a good season, look for Marchibroda to sign a
long-term extension maybe sometime in October.

WOODSON TESTS THE RULES  
 GIANTS' ACCORSI MAKES TWO GOOD MOVES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WOODSON TESTS THE RULES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Rod Woodson of the Baltimore Ravens violated the league's
substance abuse policy by refusing to take a second drug test, it
set off an intense debate between officials with the NFL and the
players association.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Woodson passed a routine drug test for illegal
substances such as cocaine and marijuana. Then, as part of the
league's program of random testing for performance enhancing drugs
like steroids or androstenedione, Woodson was again requested to
give a sample of his urine. According to several team executives,
Woodson was upset that he had given a sample only one day earlier
and refused to give another.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Woodson eventually did give the second sample, his
initial refusal counts as a positive test.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Woodson, who team executives said has never tested
positive for any illegal or banned substances, is in Stage 1 of the
league's substance abuse policy. It calls for an evaluation by a
psychiatrist, as well as an increase in random drug testing.
</P>
<P>
   The league and union are in negotiations about what to do. The
union believes that since Woodson, a future Hall of Famer who is a
member of the league's 75th anniversary team, eventually took the
second test, he should be given a break. The league thinks that if
it bends the rules for Woodson, it would set a bad precedent for
other players.
</P>
<P>
   If the league sticks to the rules, Woodson could appeal to an
arbitrator.
</P>
<P>
   GIANTS' ACCORSI MAKES TWO GOOD MOVES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New York Giants general manager Ernie Accorsi has quietly made
two key moves in recent months that show why he has been such a
highly regarded executive.
</P>
<P>
   First, he drafted UCLA defensive back Shaun Williams. At the
time, the pick was questioned because the Giants already had a
number of players at the position, but Accorsi now looks like a
genius because cornerback Jason Sehorn is lost for the season and
Williams gives them depth at Sehorn's position.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Accorsi is following the practice of his predecessor,
George Young, by continuing to lock up young players to long-term
contracts. Last week both quarterback Danny Kanell and tackle Scott
Gragg agreed to long-term contract extensions.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   _ Kansas City has changed its offense and that could be the
difference between simply making the playoffs and finally getting
to a Super Bowl. The plan is to throw deep more.
</P>
<P>
   _ Contract extension talks between Detroit and wide receiver
Herman Moore continue. Moore paid close attention to the recent
extension signed by Jerry Rice, making him the highest paid wide
receiver in the league.
</P>
<P>
   _ After watching hours of film on him, some members of San
Francisco's defensive coaching staff think Jets wide receiver
Keyshawn Johnson has cut down on the many fundamental mistakes he
made in his first two seasons in the league.

 ROMEO SALTA, 93, PIONEERING ITALIAN RESTAURATEUR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ENID NEMY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Romeo Salta, one of the first Manhattan restaurateurs
to introduce fine Italian cuisine, died Aug. 31 at his home in
Manhattan. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   Salta's namesake restaurant, Romeo Salta, on West 56th Street,
opened in 1953 and was one of the first in Manhattan to offer
elegant Northern Italian cooking, although Salta was equally proud
of the many Southern Italian dishes on his menu. Pasta was prepared
at the table and served fresh and hot, and dishes such as gnocchi,
scampi and risotto were introduced, accompanied by fine Italian
wines.
</P>
<P>
   The northern origin of much of the food aside, patrons were
greeted in an expansive Southern Italian manner and the decor was
elaborate. At the time that Salta operated the restaurant, there
were only two establishments favored by serious Italian food
lovers, Romeo Salta and San Marino, and each had its loyal
devotees.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York has never had an Italian restaurant as good as Romeo
Salta was in its heyday,'' Mimi Sheraton, a former restaurant
critic for The New York Times, said upon hearing about Salta's
death.
</P>
<P>
   Salta was born Romeo Saltalamacchia in Taranto, Italy, on Sept.
27, 1904, and raised in a state-run institution in Florence after
his father's death in an Italian naval submarine in 1910. As soon
as he was able, he, too, joined the submarine service. After his
discharge, he became a cabin steward and kitchen boy on several
Italian liners, where he learned to cook.
</P>
<P>
   He entered the United States as a penniless and illegal
immigrant in 1929, jumping ship in New York. A business card given
to him by a passenger, whom he had cared for during a bout of sea
sickness, was his passport into the restaurant world. The
passenger, who ran the Central Park Casino, hired him as a waiter,
and Salta eventually moved on to work in various capacities at the
Pierre Hotel, the Waldorf Astoria and the St. Moritz.
</P>
<P>
   He later took several jobs in the Midwest, before settling in
Los Angeles in 1933. There he was employed in nightclubs, including
the Coconut Grove and the Trocadero.
</P>
<P>
   Within five years, he and a partner transformed a rundown
drugstore and soda shop into a restaurant they named Chianti. After
a slow start, a visit by Ed Sullivan and a subsequent mention in
his newspaper column, ``Little Old New York,'' the restaurant
blossomed and soon boasted such regular patrons as Bing Crosby,
Errol Flynn and Lucille Ball.
</P>
<P>
   Salta returned to New York in the early 1950s, and in 1951, with
a partner, he opened Mercurio in midtown Manhattan. It was one of
the most popular hangouts for the top models of the day, including
the young Grace Kelly. He and his partner eventually dissolved
their business arrangement, and Salta opened Romeo Salta on West
56th Street, where it was particularly favored by theater and music
personalities and executives in the cosmetics industry.
</P>
<P>
   Salta was the author of ``The Pleasure of Italian Cooking,''
published by Macmillan in 1962. He also developed a line of frozen
foods that was sold under his name for a short time.
</P>
<P>
   After Salta gave up the daily operation of the business in 1976,
Romeo Salta was taken over by his son, Salvatore, and Salta's
second wife, Rosita. The restaurant closed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Salta was divorced from his first wife in the 1940s and married
Rosita in 1949. They were divorced in 1970. He married his third
wife, Antoinette, in 1978. His second and third wives survive him,
as do the three sons of his second marriage, Salvatore of Queens,
Romeo Jr. of Manhattan and Remo of Ridgewood, N.J., and five
grandchildren.

COMMENTARY: A COLUMNIST'S FAREWELL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since this is my last column for ``Our Towns,'' a few answers to
often-asked questions are in order.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly five years, people have asked, ``Where do you find
stories?'' Well, sometimes, it was the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   Take Herb Sherry. Herb Sherry of Brooklyn (and summers working
the Jersey Shore) started calling every once in a while, then
nearly every week, then every Friday. He had this ``human
interest'' story: his own. He billed himself as ``king of the bar
mitzvahs,'' a veteran of 40,000 parties whose Herb Sherry Orchestra
was responsible for keeping scores of musicians employed.
</P>
<P>
   At times, he'd call the day an ``Our Towns'' column ran. ``You
know,'' he'd say, ``my story is more interesting than that.'' I
must admit, after interviewing him many months later, that he was
right.
</P>
<P>
   Calls from readers led to two columns about New Jersey's
campaign to audit liquor stores and bars for back taxes. The
supposed bad guys _ tax-cheat bar owners _ turned out, in many
cases, to be the victims. The auditors, hired from civil service
lists, were coming up with some outrageous five-year bills, based
on one-year audits, that were putting little, unsophisticated bars
out of business. At least one accounting firm, in Elizabeth, found
huge errors in nearly every audit it reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   People have often asked what determines the subject of a column.
More often than not, it was news, or the stories behind news. A
visit to the Tawana Brawley defamation trial found Bill and Vera
Jones of Flatbush, Brooklyn, who drove to the Poughkeepsie
courthouse every day. They thought they'd spend a few weeks in a
courtroom, see the justice system at work. They spent eight months
there and got a mini O.J. circus.
</P>
<P>
   A news story about a murder in Hartford, Conn., led to the story
of Jay Boland, one of those rare people in a big city who look
after their neighbors. It was after one of his nightly block
watches that he was shot in a botched robbery attempt in front of
his house. His neighbors promised to stick together in his honor.
</P>
<P>
   Favorite stories? The ones about people who go their own way.
These are often people who hold on to their principles in the face
of outside pressure, like Maria Sweeney.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sweeney teaches fourth grade at Hawes Elementary School in
Ridgewood, N.J. She manages to get her students to read newspapers
and put on a play each year on a social justice issue of their
choice. Last year, after her students wrote a play on Nike's and
Disney's low-wage factories, the school refused to let them perform
it. Ms. Sweeney told her students they did nothing wrong. And
eventually, they did perform the play, on Broadway at the
Roundabout, which donated a stage for a night.
</P>
<P>
   I liked Mario Costa, owner of the White Mana Diner in Jersey
City, who had agreed to sell the place to a Dunkin' Donuts
franchisee. After realizing that the 1939 World's Fair-era diner, a
neighborhood fixture, would be effectively destroyed, he changed
his mind about selling and had to pay the buyers quite a bit of
money to go elsewhere. (They went across the street.)
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Bones, a homeless man who used to haunt the
fringes of Weehawken. His sad, gray face begged for a handout, but
he refused to ask for one. Instead, he would sell what he could
find, accept donations if offered or work for food. I'm sorry to
say I don't know what has happened to him.
</P>
<P>
   Of the many stories in Atlantic City, one that stands out is
Lillian Bryant's. She tried every which way to save the street
named after her father, New Jersey's first black Cabinet member,
from being torn up for a $330 million tunnel to a casino planned
for the city's marina district. It didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, she and two other homeowners on Horace J. Bryant
Jr. Drive won a small concession from the state: They got an
independent overseer to watch this tunnel project like a hawk.
``Remember,'' Ms. Bryant said, ``the story isn't over.''
</P>
<P>
   As I pack for a new job as the San Francisco bureau chief, I'll
remember that those are some of the truest words a reporter can
know.

WITHDRAWAL OF FINANCING RENEWS QUESTIONS ABOUT CANDIDATE'S
HUSBAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross' announcement that her
husband, Wilbur Ross Jr., was withdrawing $2.25 million he had
donated to her campaign for governor has raised a question that
prominent Democrats have been asking all year: just how wealthy is
Ross?
</P>
<P>
   No one outside Ross' immediate circle has a precise idea,
because so far he has escaped an almost obligatory ritual in modern
U.S. politics: the annual release of tax returns by candidates and
their spouses.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, politicians like Geraldine Ferraro and
Christine Todd Whitman have been pressured into revealing not only
their own tax information, but that of their wealthy husbands. If
anything, the question of a spouse's finances may be of greater
import in Ms. McCaughey Ross' case because _ until last week _ Ross
was providing most of the money for her campaign, and helping to
run it.
</P>
<P>
   Ross has revealed nothing about his finances, and he and Ms.
McCaughey Ross have faced little pressure to do so. The lieutenant
governor, who is competing in the Sept. 15 Democratic primary, made
her own tax returns available for reporters to review in April, but
she and her husband file separately.
</P>
<P>
   The other three Democrats in the race have made public their
joint filings with their spouses, as has Gov. George Pataki, the
Republican who was once Ms. McCaughey Ross' mentor.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the lieutenant governor declined to discuss her
husband's finances.
</P>
<P>
   Ross, who is traveling on business in Asia, has not returned
calls to his office in recent days. He is senior managing director
of Rothschild Inc., the investment bank, and owns a controlling
interest in News Communications, which owns 23 weekly newspapers in
New York as well as The Hill, a weekly that covers Congress. He is
also a director of Syms, the clothing store; Mego Financial Corp.,
a developer of time-share vacation properties, and KTI, a waste
management company.
</P>
<P>
   All year, prominent Democrats have questioned whether Ross is
truly wealthy enough to bankroll a credible statewide race. Among
those voicing doubt were campaign aides to Ms. McCaughey Ross'
chief rival, Peter Vallone, the New York City council speaker. The
other Democratic candidates are Brooklyn District Attorney Charles
Hynes and former state Transportation Commissioner James Larocca.
</P>
<P>
   But the other candidates have not made an issue of Ross' refusal
to release his tax returns. Officials in the rival camps said they
were reluctant to draw attention to Ms. McCaughey Ross, who they
said has always received a disproportionate share of the news
coverage of the campaign.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Larocca, whose effort has been hampered by a lack of money, also
argued that the lieutenant governor, as the only woman in the race,
might have accused anyone who demanded to see her husband's tax
returns of sexism. ``She has played the victim throughout her brief
public career, and is very good at it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCaughey Ross announced on Thursday that the campaign had
returned to Ross $2.25 million, leaving the campaign virtually
without funds. Earlier in the year, she and her aides said Ross
would spend $10 million or more, conferring instant credibility on
a candidate who had been a Democrat for just a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Some wealthy Democratic fund-raisers who know Ross, including
some who are also in investment banking, have said all year that he
could ill afford to part with even $5 million, estimating his net
worth at $10 million to $20 million. The recent downturn in the
stock market and a financial dispute between Ross and his former
wife have raised more questions about the extent of his wealth.
</P>
<P>
   While Ross has not made his tax returns public, statements filed
by the lieutenant governor with the State Ethics Commission give
glimpses into his finances.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure forms list 37 entities, many of them ventures of
Rothschild, in which he holds an ownership interest, and 26 sources
of income, including the sale of stock in such major companies as
Texaco and Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   But while the filing lists broad categories of value for each of
those holdings and sources of income _ the lowest is under $5,000,
and the highest is above $250,000 _ that portion of the report, as
a matter of policy, is not available for public review.

TWO MEN, BOTH CHALLENGING ONE HOME RUN RECORD ... THE YEAR, 1927 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also BBO-MCGWIRE, which will move at the conclusion of the
Cardinals-Reds game.) 
(jt) 
 By IRA BERKOW    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It had turned into a two-man race for the major league home run
lead, and a dramatic pursuit by both players of the single-season
home run record. Sound familiar?
</P>
<P>
   Two men neck and neck as the season wound into the home stretch,
two men not only playing in the same league, but also, in this
case, on the same team. The year was 1927, the men were Babe Ruth
and Lou Gehrig, batting third and fourth in the Yankee lineup. And
the record they were pursuing was that held by the Bambino himself,
who had crashed 59 homers in 1921.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle would be an identical Yankee
tandem on an identical quest 34 years later, and Mark McGwire _ who
hit his 60th home run Saturday _ and Sammy Sosa are linked by
league, if not by team. But the convivial Ruth and the reticent
Gehrig were the historical prototypes for the two-man pursuit of
one of the most revered records in sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, it was the big sports story of the year,'' recalled Irwin
Rosee, now 89 years old, but a student at James Madison High School
in Brooklyn in 1927. ``There were no radios in those days, and so
you had to wait for the late edition of the afternoon papers to get
the news. Everybody used to huddle around the newsstands waiting
for the papers to arrive. There was a lot of excitement. It was
like Lindbergh flying over the ocean. It was the same year.''
</P>
<P>
   From April to the middle of August in 1927, Gehrig not only
matched Ruth homer for homer, but by Aug. 10 he also led Ruth, 38
to 35. Since Ruth had switched over from being a full-time pitcher
to an everyday outfielder, in 1919, no one until now had seriously
challenged him as the home run king of his day. He had led the
league in homers in seven of the previous nine years (missing
titles only because he had been out of action for nearly two months
in each of the other two seasons). But now Gehrig, at age 24, eight
years younger than Ruth and in only his third full season in the
big leagues, had suddenly found the home run range.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Ruth fought off the challenge with a charge that
began in mid-August and lasted to the end of September and left him
with the record of 60 homers that would stand for 34 years, or
until Maris did him one better in, as has been widely known and
discussed, a schedule that consisted of 162 games, eight more than
Ruth's.
</P>
<P>
   During his late-season surge, Ruth caught Gehrig at the end of
August, moved two home runs ahead on Sept. 1, but then lost the
lead. On Sept. 6, at the beginning of a doubleheader against the
Red Sox, the two sluggers were tied at 44 home runs each. On that
day, Gehrig hit one home run, and Ruth hit three _ two in the first
game and one in the second _ to take a 47-45 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth hit two more the next day. Four days later, he hit No. 50.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he hit his 50th he talked of breaking his record, but it
seemed all but impossible; there were only 17 games left to play,''
wrote Robert W. Creamer in the Ruth biography, ``Babe: The Legend
Comes to Life.'' But Ruth continued slugging homers, while Gehrig
slowed down, seemingly worn out. Ruth appeared to be relishing the
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``On No. 56,'' wrote Creamer, Ruth ``carried his bat around the
bases with him to frustrate souvenir-seekers. As he passed third
base a boy came out of the stands, pounded him joyfully on the back
and grabbed the bat. Babe dragged the boy and bat all the way
across home plate.''
</P>
<P>
   He went two games without hitting a homer, and there were just
four games left. But in the next three games he hit three homers _
the 59th a grand slam against the Washington Senators.
</P>
<P>
   It was now Sept. 30, the next-to-last day of the season (the
Yankees ended up playing 155 games because of a tie). Ruth, facing
Tom Zachary with a man on base, hit a shot down the right-field
line and into the seats for a home run. Zachary yelled ``Foul ball!
Foul ball!'' and argued with the umpire, to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the crowd cheered and the Yankee players roared their
greeting,'' reported The New York Times, ``the Babe made his
triumphant, almost regal, tour of the paths. He jogged around
slowly, touched each base firmly and carefully, and when he
imbedded his spikes into the rubber dish ... hats were tossed
liberally and the spirit of celebration permeated the place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In those days,'' Creamer said by telephone recently, ``the
number 60 had a magical ring to it. People used to say, `Going like
60,' which probably came from racing a car at what was an
incredible speed back then.''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Ruth was exuberant about his feat. ``Sixty,
count 'em, 60!'' he shouted in the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Gehrig managed 47 homers for the season _ he had just three in
September, while Ruth had walloped 17. (The National League leader
was Cy Williams of Philadelphia with 30.) That season, though,
Gehrig hit for a higher average than Ruth, .373 to .356, and led
both leagues in runs batted in, 175 to Ruth's 164.
</P>
<P>
   As for challenging Ruth's home run record, Jimmie Foxx in 1932
and Hank Greenberg in 1938 could get as far as 58. And then came
Maris _ and now McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees of 1927 were a tremendous team, setting an American
League record for victories in a season, with 110 (that stood until
Cleveland won 111 in 1954), and then sweeping the Pirates in the
World Series. As for Ruth, there was one more regular-season game
for him to play after he hit his 60th. He went 0 for 3.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter, for he belted two more homers in the World Series
while Gehrig had none. The Sultan of Swat had prevailed again. &QL;

U.S. AND JAPANESE OFFICIALS SPLIT ON SERIOUSNESS OF ECONOMIC
CRISIS

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The economic policy leaders of the world's two
largest economies, the United States and Japan, spent hours here
Friday night talking about the heightened risk of global recession
and a further spread of the turmoil that has engulfed Asia, Russia
and now Latin America. But they left Saturday morning with no new
plans, and an uneasy sense that Japan and the United States remain
on different wavelengths about how quickly countries must act.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion over dinner on Nob Hill included Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan,
and Kiichi Miyazawa, the former prime minister who reluctantly
agreed to take the job of finance minister last month during
Japan's deepest recession since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   At the dinner's end, American officials said they feared that
Japan's leaders still did not accept the premise that Japan's huge
banking crisis and its moribund economy were a major cause of the
turmoil that included a stomach-churning dive on Wall Street last
week, huge market drops and instability in Latin America and
deepening chaos in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The astounding descent of the ruble, which has dropped 63
percent since Aug. 17 and has already begun to create food
shortages and tremendous inflation, led the British government on
Saturday to announce that a meeting of deputy finance ministers
from the world's largest economic powers, the Group of 7, was
planned in London, probably this week, to map out a new Russia
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sign of the growing split between Tokyo and Washington,
Japanese officials bristled at the mounting American pressure and
suggested that they were being made scapegoats for problems that
are unrelated to Tokyo's seven years of economic mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can Japan's recession be responsible for an economic
malaise in Latin America or Russia?'' asked a senior Japanese
official, who insisted on anonymity. ``Japan has been overly
criticized. My concern is that if anything happens to the U.S.
economy, everyone will point to Japan and say it is responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting took place as Rubin and Greenspan, who in ordinary
times often outdo each other at understatement, issued warnings
that the world economy is in a particularly fragile state.
</P>
<P>
   Only hours before the dinner, Greenspan, in a speech at the
University of California at Berkeley, cautioned that ``it is just
not credible that the United States can remain an oasis of
prosperity unaffected by a world that is experiencing greatly
increased stress.'' He appeared to open the door to the possibility
that the Federal Reserve might consider a cut in interest rates if
more evidence arose that downturns on three continents were
beginning to stall the American economy.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin, in a conversation as he flew from Washington to his
meeting here, said that ``these are clearly extremely difficult
times in the world economy and world financial markets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an unprecedented situation in a host of respects,''
said the treasury secretary, who experienced several major market
drops in his 26 years on Wall Street as a trader and then
co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs, the investment banking firm. ``The
number of countries experiencing difficulties at once is something
we have not seen before.''
</P>
<P>
   The speed at which hundreds of billions of dollars that flowed
into emerging economies in the 1990s have flowed out was also
unprecedented. The inflow occurred, Rubin said, because ``investors
got progressively less rigorous about risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Now they see risk everywhere, Rubin and other treasury officials
note, and they rarely discriminate between countries with deep
problems and countries that are simply fighting off economic
contagion. A global credit crunch has resulted, with countries that
lived off of huge flows of international investment now unable to
obtain it at any price.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a situation which is indeed a dangerous one, by far
not fully rational,'' said Michel Camdessus, the managing director
of the embattled International Monetary Fund, which has been
charged by its many critics with exacerbating the crisis it stepped
in to abate.
</P>
<P>
   Camdessus, speaking in Washington at the conclusion of a meeting
of Latin American finance ministers who had come to plead for
relief, said: ``The degree of panic going on _ this is, indeed,
clearly exacting an excessive and unfair pressure on a large number
of countries.''
</P>
<P>
   For Camdessus, that is a significant change of tone. In January,
he signed an agreement in Indonesia with President Suharto that he
declared would restore confidence _ only to see the country
dissolve into violence, economic chaos and political upheaval that
forced Suharto's resignation. Early this summer Camdessus declared
that there was no crisis in Russia, and a huge one erupted within
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few months ago people were talking about seeing the light at
the end of the tunnel,'' said Jeffrey Garten, the dean of the Yale
School of Management, a former top official in the Commerce
Department. ``Now the only hope is keeping the world economy from
total deterioration. And you get a sense that this is all now truly
left to Adam Smith's invisible hand _ it's beyond any country's
ability, any institution's ability, to control.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For their part, Rubin and Greenspan, speaking frequently by
phone and at their weekly breakfast meetings in Washington, are
choosing their words with extraordinary care. Neither, for example,
has used the phrase ``global recession'' in public. They fear that
the phrase alone might cause more selloffs and make continued
turmoil a self-fulfilling prophecy.
</P>
<P>
   But Miyazawa, speaking in Japanese at a news conference here
Friday evening, used a close equivalent to the term. And at one
point he broke into English to discuss how the failure of a major
Japanese bank, the Long Term Credit Bank of Japan, ``might result
in systemic risk for the United States and for Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Systemic risk'' is the phrase used by monetary authorities to
describe how the failure of an institution or a severe market drop
in one economy can course through the global economy, setting off
events elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   For Miyazawa, 78, the return to San Francisco to plead for
``more patience'' to deal with Japan's problems had odd historical
echoes. In 1951, as a young, English-speaking bureaucrat, Miyazawa
was a central behind-the-scenes player in the negotiation of the
peace treaty between Japan and the United States _ signed here _
that ended the American occupation of his country and set it on the
path to become an economic superpower. In the ensuing half-century,
Japan has often turned to Miyazawa, whose contacts in Washington
run deep, to deal with what the Japanese call ``gaiatsu,'' or
foreign pressure. He grew up in the Japanese finance ministry, and
assured his dinner partners Friday night _ in the presence of the
ministry's officials _ that he could deal with bureaucratic
resistance to reform of Japan's economic system.
</P>
<P>
   But he was less sanguine about his ability to get Japan's
Parliament to act quickly on financial rescue legislation. The key
dispute is whether to allow a huge infusion of taxpayer money to
the banking system to rid it of bad loans.

A NORTH KOREAN SATELLITE? U.S. IS SEARCHING 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also NKOREA-KIM)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States now believes it is possible that
North Korea succeeded in putting a satellite into orbit when it
fired a multistage rocket over Japan last Monday, officials said
Saturday, retreating from their initial assessment that the launch
was a missile test alone.
</P>
<P>
   The trajectory of the rocket and other characteristics of its
flight lend some credibility to North Korea's claim on Friday that
it had launched its first satellite into space, a U.S. government
official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible they put something out there,'' the official
said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Space Command, located at Peterson Air Force Base in
Colorado, has been scouring the skies in search of the satellite,
which North Korea's official news agency said is circling the earth
every 2 hours and 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But the command's spokesman, Navy Cmdr. David Knox, said
Saturday that there was still no confirmation of a satellite.
</P>
<P>
   After North Korea fired a multistage rocket on Monday, defense
and intelligence officials said they had closely monitored
preparations for the launch. They said the rocket was a two-stage
ballistic missile, called the Taepodong-1, that North Korea had
under development for years.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has protested the launch during a series of
talks with a North Korean delegation in New York City. Those talks,
which have covered a range of issues including North Korea's
missile and nuclear programs, continued Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   While North Korea said its satellite would promote ``scientific
research for peaceful use of outer space,'' officials in Washington
said the rocket firing represented a dangerous breakthrough in
North Korea's efforts to build longer-range missiles.

CRUISE SHIPS USED FOR DRUG SMUGGLING, U.S. SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FRANK BRUNI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With the arrests Saturday of two cruise ship
employees as their vessel docked in Manhattan, federal law
enforcement officials revealed the existence of an unusual drug
ring that they said used luxury ocean liners to funnel cocaine,
hashish and marijuana from New York City to the island of Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
   These officials estimated that the operation, which involved
slightly more than a dozen people with code names like ``Fidel,''
``007,'' ``Ratty'' and ``Puny,'' accounted for 25 percent to 50
percent of the illegal drugs flowing into Bermuda in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   And they said the method of smuggling was strikingly atypical,
thrusting a high-stakes, illegal activity into an atmosphere
associated with pleasure and escape from the grittier side of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never think that while you're on vacation, you're in the
midst of serious drug smuggling,'' said Jodi Avergun, an assistant
U.S. attorney prosecuting seven of the defendants in the case.
``You think you're safe and secure on a cruise to Bermuda but, in
fact, there are drug smugglers serving you lunch or making your
meal.''
</P>
<P>
   Diane Ingalls, a spokeswoman for the federal Drug Enforcement
Administration, which was involved in the investigation, said that
eight of the 13 people arrested since March in connection with the
operation held jobs with Celebrity or Norwegian cruise lines, most
of them in low-paying kitchen positions. Ms. Ingalls stressed that
the cruise lines had cooperated fully in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining five defendants coordinated drop-offs and money
transfers in either New York or Jamaica, law enforcement officials
said. All have been charged with conspiracy to distribute
narcotics; an additional three people are still being sought by
investigators, Ms. Ingalls said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials identified the mastermind of the operation as Delroy
Andrews, 43, of Brooklyn. Andrews, they said, orchestrated the
transport of drugs from Jamaica to New York City and then to
Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Avergun said it was unclear whether the cruise line workers
carrying drugs from New York to Bermuda and money from Bermuda back
to New York had been recruited before or after they took jobs
aboard the ships. But she said that ship workers in general attract
less scrutiny, and go through less rigorous inspections, than
tourists traveling the same route do.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ingalls noted a second clever rationale behind the smuggling
scheme. ``You're losing a certain amount of overhead by using
someone who has a legitimate means to be on the boat,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The operation began to come to light two years ago, when one of
those involved in it was spotted with drugs by Bermudian
authorities and arrested. Using information he provided, Bermudian
and American authorities conducted surveillances, wiretaps and
posed undercover as drug customers in Bermuda to catch others
involved in the scheme.
</P>
<P>
   The couriers usually carried relatively small quantities of the
drugs, sometimes tucking them inside thickly folded bedsheets and
then carrying them off the ships in shopping bags during the hours
or days that the vessels were docked in Bermuda, officials said.

 McGWIRE HITS No. 60, JOINING RUTH AND MARIS  
(See also BBO-McGWIRE-RUTH, BBO-MCGWIRE-VECSEY-COLUMN) 
(nk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ First there was Babe Ruth. Then there was Roger
Maris. Now there is Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   With one of his patented uppercut swings, McGwire lofted another
majestic fly ball into the left field stands at Busch Stadium in
the first inning Saturday, becoming the third player in major
league baseball history to hit 60 home runs in a season.
</P>
<P>
   Just ahead: No. 61, which will tie the record Maris set in 1961
when he broke Ruth's fabled mark, and No. 62, which will break
Maris' record.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire reached the rarefied plateau considerably sooner than
Ruth or Maris. Ruth hit his record-setting 60th in the Yankees'
154th game in 1927; Maris tied the record in the Yankees' 159th
game in 1961. This was the Cardinals' 142d game of this season.
</P>
<P>
   When McGwire walked to the plate in the first inning to the
cheers of a sold out stadium, he carried with him a remarkably poor
record against Cincinnati pitchers. In seven previous games, he had
managed only two hits in 16 at-bats, neither of the hits a home
run, making the Reds the only National League team against whom
McGwire had not hit a home run this season.
</P>
<P>
   He would face Dennis Reyes, a 21-year-old left-handed pitcher
from Mexico, who had said Friday night he would not be afraid to
pitch to McGwire, that is, give him pitches to hit rather than walk
him, a tactic the Reds had followed 12 times this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Reyes' first pitch was inside and low for a ball, and the
fans booed. His second pitch was also low, and the fans booed more
lustily. The third pitch produced instant cheers.
</P>
<P>
   At 1:30 p.m. New York time, McGwire swung and drove the ball to
left field. He and everyone else in the park knew instantly this
was No. 60.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire rounded the bases euphorically, high-fiving Rene
Lachemann, the Cardinals' coach, when he reached third, then
exchanging fist salutes with his teammates after he crossed the
plate and reached the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   The fans, who had already been standing during his time at bat,
stood even taller as they roared with ecstasy, their red shirts and
red hats brightening the park as if it could get any brighter on
this 93-degree day. They kept cheering until McGwire re-emerged
from the dugout, waved to them and thrust his left fist joyously
into the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. 60 for McGwire,'' said a press box announcement that is
made routinely when a player hits a home run. But there was nothing
routine about the announcement or the home run. ``No. 60'' carried
a strange sound because how many people had ever heard it announced
during a game?
</P>
<P>
   Only once in their pre1998 history had the Cardinals even had
two players hit a combined 60 home runs. That was in 1925 when
Rogers Hornsby and Jim Bottomley did it. Here was McGwire reaching
that number all by himself.
</P>
<P>
   But his achievements this season have been even more impressive.
Having slugged 52 and 58 home runs the previous two seasons,
McGwire became the first player to hit 50 or more in three
successive seasons. Not even Ruth did that.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire also surpassed Ruth's record for most home runs in two
successive seasons. The one he hit in the first inning Saturday was
his 118th in 1997-98. Ruth hit 114 in 1927-28.
</P>
<P>
   When he hit his 57th last Tuesday night in Florida, the Paul
Bunyan-like slugger broke Hack Wilson's 68-year-old National League
record. And when he deposited No. 59 into the Marlins' stands
Wednesday night, the first baseman became the most prolific
right-handed home run hitter of all time, surpassing Jimmie Foxx
(1932) and Hank Greenberg (1938). Ruth and Maris, the only ones
remaining for McGwire to pass, were left-handed hitters.
</P>
<P>
   Another right-handed hitter, Sammy Sosa, is chasing McGwire as
well as Ruth and Maris. Sosa socked his 57th home run in the
Chicago Cubs' game in Pittsburgh on Friday night. The Cubs and the
Pirates were scheduled to play Saturday night.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   McGwire had failed to hit a home run against the Reds Friday
night after collecting 12 home runs in the Cardinals' previous 17
games, including four in the space of five at-bats over two games
against the Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   In his next three at-bats Saturday, McGwire struck out.
</P>
<P>
   When he batted in the second inning, 25 minutes after he
connected for No. 60, it marked only the second time in 71 years
that a batter stood at the plate with a chance to hit his 61st home
run.
</P>
<P>
   Once again Reyes threw the first pitch low for a ball, and once
again the fans booed. But then Reyes threw two pitches down that
McGwire took for strikes. His next pitch was up, and McGwire swung
at it but missed, prompting a sound of disappointment from the
people in civilian red.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Remlinger, also left-handed, was the pitcher when McGwire
took his second crack at 61. McGwire took his first pitch for a
strike, then swung at the next two pitches and missed both.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, with runners on second and third, McGwire struck
out swinging against John Hudek.

BEACH TOWNS GIVE SUMMER OF '98 A FAVORABLE REVIEW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., N.Y., Conn.)   (bl)  
 By IVER PETERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEASIDE HEIGHTS, N.J. _ Bobby Dee, a k a Robert DiPeso, counted
out the quarters for the players at the Gift Wheel at Bobby Dee's
Casino (``Nobody leaves without a TV!'') on the Wildwood boardwalk
and pronounced the summer of 1998 a good one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weather was excellent, the water was clean, the families
showed up,'' he said. ``That equals a good summer for us.''
</P>
<P>
   DiPeso's contented appraisal found plenty of echoes up and down
the region's shoreline as the last week of unofficial summer drew
toward its Labor Day finale.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, dramatic reporting about Hurricane Bonnie scared some
visitors away toward the end of August, and rain in June kept Jones
Beach in New York from matching last year's turnout. But for a part
of the country that equates summer with sand and salt water, with
quiet family seafood cookouts and the raucous honky-tonk of the
boardwalk, the season just ending was clearly a success.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have disposable cash and they're roaming around looking
for entertainment,'' said David Shotwell, senior administrator of
the Ocean Grove Camp Meeting Association, the annual Christian
jamboree on the Jersey Shore. ``You can just tell by the number of
people who don't know where the bathrooms are that we're getting a
lot of new people.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may have stumbled in here by accident,'' Shotwell
continued, ``but we sure try to make sure they come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennie Masher and her daughter Jill were among DiPeso's
contestants at the Gift Wheel _ no TV yet _ which is like a wheel
of fortune game in a real casino, but stays legal by offering
prizes instead of cash. Fourteen members of Mrs. Masher's extended
family had come down for a week from Troy, N.Y., fourteen years
after their last visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been here before and wanted to come back with the
kids,'' said Mrs. Masher, a homemaker. ``It's been fun because
there's a lot to do, and the kids like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourism agencies are still far from knowing the final count of
hotel taxes, beach tag sales, parking lot receipts and all the
other measures of the summer's financial impact.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are some fragments of early data to suggest that it
was a good season: the Connecticut Office of Tourism reported that
tourist stops at highway information centers were up 5.7 percent
and that the $6.8 billion in hotel and motel taxes collected in
June was well above last year's $4.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   On the southern Jersey Shore, a collection of a similar tourism
tax to build a new convention center in Wildwood was 34 percent
ahead of last year's level through June.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic City's hotels topped last year's extraordinary 94
percent occupancy rate with a 97 percent filled rate through
August, according to Linda Conlin, executive director of the Office
of Travel and Tourism in New Jersey's Department of Commerce and
Economic Development. And Ms. Conlin said an informal survey of
shore businesses also produced an upbeat bottom line: ``Equal to
last year's good summer season, if not surpassing it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism spending amounted to $25.5 billion in New Jersey last
year and accounted for 623,000 jobs, according to the department.
Spending totaled $14 billion on the Jersey Shore, which supported
267,000 tourism-related jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Shore tourism officials said that water quality across the
region was not the problem it had been several years ago, when
algae blooms, pollution and medical debris washing ashore made
frequent headlines. In New York, Hurricane Bonnie actually scoured
an outlying sandbar and deposited more beach sand on the Fire
Island shoreline, said Gerard Stoddard, president of the Fire
Island Association.
</P>
<P>
   Good beach weather during July and August took crowds to the
South Shore of Long Island, N.Y., as well, but summer visits to
Jones Beach State Park decreased to 3.9 million this year from 4.4
million last year because of rainy weekends in June, said the
superintendent, Joseph F. Lescinski.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a problem, it was that because Labor Day came a
week after the end of August, the traditional finish line, many
young ride operators, ticket takers and pizza waiters were gone for
the final week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our workers come from the Toms River School District,
which, without any thought or consideration for the tourist
industry, reopened its doors on Sept. 1,'' said Bill Irwin, general
manager of the Casino Pier and Waterworks arcade and amusement
park, which employs 700 seasonal workers in Seaside Heights. ``That
left us a bit short-handed.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin and other natives of the Jersey Shore know that, for all
the year-to-year sameness the summer seasons seem to share, a lot
has changed.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of the dual-career family has meant that few visitors
take a house for the summer the way they used to, said Vicki Clark,
director of marketing for the Cape May Chamber of Commerce, so
rentals tend to be for shorter periods, and are more often arranged
on the spur of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Some things never change, though. J.R. and Terri Bale and their
two boys, from New Providence, have a three-week rental with Mrs.
Bale's mother and her sister's family in Seaside Heights this
summer, just the way Mrs. Bale's extended family, the Azzolinas,
the Giaimos and the Valentis, shared summer rentals when she was
growing up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always had a house when I was a kid,'' Mrs. Bale said.
``Then we grew up into teen-agers and we didn't want to do that
with everyone's parents, and it ended. But now maybe we're starting
it all over again with our own kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Dolan, a food broker from Kearny, bought a house with
his wife, Jo-Ann, on the bay side at Chadwicks, a few miles up the
barrier island from Seaside Heights, partly to give their seven
grandchildren a taste of what the shore was like in the old days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up as a kid, we'd leave the day after school ended and
stay for two months,'' he said. ``We made new friends every
summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Out on the beach behind Dolan, Robert Gluck had reached page 239
of ``Buddenbrooks,'' which is less than halfway through Thomas
Mann's masterpiece. ``A couple of days,'' he said, when asked how
long it had taken him to get as far as that in his heavy seaside
reading. ``Three months,'' his wife, Cindy, corrected him.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter _ Mann was on his face in the sand, and Gluck was
content just to be there, with the sound of the surf thumping a few
hundred feet away.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you grew up coming to the shore, you get to a point where
if you don't smell the brine and feel the sand between toes, you're
missing something,'' said Gluck, a freelance writer. ``You wait for
summer to come, and then it comes, and then it goes by fast,
because you're having fun.''

REUTERS CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS NEXT TO BUGS AND MICKEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN HOLUSHA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the next addition to the revival of Times Square,
the Reuters building on the blockfront between 42nd and 43rd
streets on Seventh Avenue faces an unusual design challenge. It is
intended to blend the dignity of a major corporate headquarters
with a location that has Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse as its
immediate neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The project is a joint venture of Reuters, the international
news and financial services company, and the Rudin family, builders
and owners of residential and commercial properties in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   Various Reuters operations, including a securities trading floor
and television studios, will occupy 506,000 square feet of the
855,000-square-foot building, which will have the address 3 Times
Square.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to try to satisfy a lot of constituencies in this
area,'' said William Rudin, president of Rudin Management Co., the
family's leasing and property management subsidiary. He said the
building would have the brightly lighted signs that are required by
the zoning in the area, but said the approach can't be ``too
glitzy,'' because of the presence of the Reuters headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, with a Warner Bros. Studio Store across Seventh
Avenue and a Disney store across 42nd Street, the neighborhood is
not going to be confused with Park Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Rudin said that the recent gyrations of the stock market would
have no impact on the project. ``We have our financing in place and
the interest rate is locked in,'' he said. Prudential Insurance
Co., the previous owner of the site, is providing both the
construction loan and the 20-year long-term financing and has
retained the right to place some signs on 42nd Street.
</P>
<P>
   As for the 30 percent of the office space and 80,000 square feet
of retail space that still need to be leased, Rudin said the Times
Square market was strong enough to resist stock market
fluctuations. ``We don't see the New York market being affected,''
he said. ``There is no speculative building in the Times square
area. If you build a good product, there will be demand for it.''
</P>
<P>
   With demolition of existing buildings at the site just getting
under way, Reuters does not expect to move in until the spring of
2001, although some of the retail space may be occupied as much as
a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The building is being presented as the latest in high-tech,
``green'' development, although it will apparently not go as far in
using environmentally sensitive techniques as the partially erected
Conde Nast building at 42nd Street and Broadway, which has a 4
Times Square address.
</P>
<P>
   The Conde Nast building has photovoltaic cells, which convert
sunlight into electricity without generating pollution,
incorporated in the outer wall of the building. The structure,
which is being developed by the Durst Organization, also includes
two 400-kilowatt fuel cells to provide larger amounts of low
pollution power and as a backup in case of a power failure.
</P>
<P>
   Rudin executives say they will not put photovoltaic cells in the
building wall but are still studying the economics and
environmental consequences of fuel cells. ``On photovoltaics, we
just don't think the science is there yet,'' said Rudin Management
chief operating officer John Gilbert. He said the base building had
been designed to incorporate fuel cells if studies show them to be
cost effective and environmentally benign. ``We are looking at
everything they did across the street,'' Gilbert said.
</P>
<P>
   Those evaluations are made easier because they are using the
same firm, Fox &AMP; Fowle Architects, that designed the Conde Nast
building as well as the same construction manager, Tishman
Construction.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Fox, a principal of the architectural firm, said energy
conserving technologies, such as a facade that lets in natural
light while blocking most heat energy, were being emphasized. He
said the walls are so efficient _ and the amount of heat generated
by people and machines so great _ that the building will not have
to be heated, even on cold winter days.
</P>
<P>
   He said both electric and gas-driven cooling units would be
installed in the building, with the option of operating each based
on electrical rates, which typically peak on weekday afternoons,
but fall off at night.
</P>
<P>
   The building was designed with its core structure _ which
contains the elevator shafts, stairways and other common elements _
at the center, so that offices can ring the core for greater access
to natural sunlight. Fox said the developers were considering
interior lighting that dims as sunlight increases to conserve power
usage.
</P>
<P>
   As might be expected from the Rudins, who took an aging, empty
office building at 55 Broad St. and transformed it into a high-tech
center by installing advanced communications equipment, the Reuters
Building will be heavily wired. In addition to electrical power,
the building will have optical fiber and advanced copper
communications gear plus antennas and satellite dishes on the roof
for wireless communication.
</P>
<P>
   There is also provision for future developments. ``The amount of
riser space in the building is well above the norm,'' said Glenn
Elliott, senior vice president at Reuters for real estate,
referring to the vertical passages that house the wiring. ``We
tried to figure out everything we could possibly need, then added
50 percent for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Reuters will have five 750-kilowatt diesel-powered generators on
the roof so that it can maintain operations in case of a power
failure. Another will be installed to sustain operations of the
building itself, with a pad provided for an additional one if
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Rudin said one reason that Reuters decided to participate in the
development of a new building, rather than rent space in an
existing structure, is the freedom it gave the company to customize
the design to its needs. For example, the floor that will house the
Reuters Instinet subsidiary's trading floor will be 16 feet slab to
slab, compared with just under 9 feet for other floors.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The trading floor will be the eighth, which will place it above
the brightly lighted signs that will adorn the building.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert said Reuters also had other reasons for choosing a new
building. ``Most importantly, it was a cost-saving alternative to a
traditional lease position in a rising market,'' he said. He said
being an owner also gave the company ``an opportunity to create a
brand image for the Reuters name.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the image-creating will be done on a fourth-floor
television studio that will be visible from the outside. With the
lower part of 1500 Broadway, across Times Square at the northeast
corner of 43rd Street, being converted to broadcast ABC's ``Good
Morning America'' show, the two studios could easily each end up in
the other's backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   The original design for the building called for several news
zippers, similar to the one across Seventh Avenue at One Times
Square. But Gilbert said the zippers were now out of the picture in
favor of full video displays.
</P>
<P>
   The retail space will be multilevel, including the lower
concourse level and the first, second and third floors. Because the
building will include an entrance to the Times Square subway
station _ relocating it about 75 feet to the west, to where it was
in the 1930s _ and a lobby for the office building, there will be
less ground-floor retail space available than before demolition.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the developers say they have decided to try to
attract three relatively large retail tenants, so that each will
have adequate exposure at street level, rather than replace the
gaggle of small stores that were previously there. (These stores
operated on leases with six-month cancellation clauses that were
invoked in March. All were closed by mid-August.)
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a difficult footprint to work with, because of the
subway, the loading docks and so forth,'' Rudin said. To enlarge
the site, the partnership bought a small building and driveway
facing on 43rd Street. But because the building housed offices for
the New Victory Theater and the driveway allowed back-door
deliveries to the theater, one of the loading docks in the new
building will be for the New Victory. In addition, a new lobby for
the theater will be provided at the concourse level on 42nd Street.
</P>
<P>
   With construction under way on both sides of Times Square and to
the west along 42nd Street, Rudin said the area is clearly
re-established as an office location and retail destination. But he
noted that the process of renewal had taken a long time. ``My
father was involved in an effort to redevelop Times Square 25 years
ago,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The ball soared into the steamy ozone of the
Mississippi River Valley, and eventually it came down. Mark McGwire
has been so hot, so consistent, so productive, that it seemed _
dare one say it? _ almost anticlimactic.
</P>
<P>
   The big man had tied Babe Ruth, and the day was young. In his
first at-bat Saturday, McGwire hit his 60th home run of this
season, but his excellence made the blast seem inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   The left fielder did not move. McGwire jogged around the bases.
He and a few teammates performed a little elbows-and-chest bumping
ritual at home plate. And then the Cardinals swarmed around him,
but professionally.
</P>
<P>
   They would save their real emotions for the 61st home that would
tie Roger Maris, and then the 62nd that would send McGwire and his
new best friend, Sammy Sosa, toward new territory, the middle 60s,
in the last two weeks of the season.
</P>
<P>
   While McGwire's shot went soaring into the lower deck, 381 feet
away, above the BJC Health System advertisement, another
competition was just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   There was the fans' challenge to catch and keep the baseball
McGwire had propelled, a ball that could make somebody rich, or at
least solvent. Then there was the task of helping the fan live to
tell the tale.
</P>
<P>
   The odd couple of Major League Baseball and the Cardinals
management had been planning the response to the epic homers that
might happen on this home stand.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, a young journalism graduate from the
University of Missouri foiled the assorted special agents, guards,
ushers, security officers and his fellow fans to come up with the
ball. And here is the upset: he doesn't want money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to give it back to Mark,'' said 22-year-old Deni
Allen. ``It's his ball. I think that's right.''
</P>
<P>
   Didn't Allen want something for the ball? ``I want to take
batting practice,'' Allen said. ``And I'd like a few season tickets
for my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the speculation about the value of McGwire's and Sosa's
baseballs, this seems extremely high-minded. But what if the
Cardinals _ an organization not known for its sense of fun _ refuse
to allow him?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, they'll let me,'' Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   Allen works for the St. Louis Rams, a team that plays a bizarre
sport involving a ball that is not round. He came by his tickets
honestly _ his grandparents from Ozark, Mo., bought them _ and he
was in Section 286, plotting his move to McGwire's home run alley,
the left-field stands, where fans have a ticket for a wonderful
souvenir or a big payday _ or personal injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Mabry got his hit,'' Allen said at a news conference
later, ``I figured I'd better get hustling. I jumped a few aisles,
went around a couple of guards, thought I'd get stopped, and a guy
doing his job stopped me, and I respect that, but I hung out and I
made my move.''
</P>
<P>
   He was in perfect position for the high fly but somebody else
touched it first. ``You see it every time,'' Allen said. ``The
first guy never catches it.''
</P>
<P>
   The ball skimmed off other fingers and ``I took a few punches''
but Allen secured the ball, and then the task force secured him,
without much trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's be honest,'' said Kevin Hallinan, the executive director
of security and facility management for baseball. ``These are good
fans, nice people. We don't expect a lot of rough stuff, but we
have to be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   In most parts of the world, the average innocent fan may be
unprepared for a couple of hundred alcohol-fueled louts, willing to
dive headfirst into the pile, like linebackers on 'roid rage. (Or
is that redundant?)
</P>
<P>
   To keep the McGwire chase from becoming Lord of the Flies Meets
World's Toughest Man in Bar Fight, baseball barred everybody from
home run country unless they had a ticket. Reporters, with our
special 59-62 credentials, are not allowed to infiltrate the
hallowed sections.
</P>
<P>
   While fans are protected from the mobs in foul territory and
other alien sites, it could have come down to father vs. son,
brother vs. brother, truck driver vs. little old lady. It could get
ugly. But it was not ugly for Deni Allen, who had already made up
his mind what he would do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more excited about meeting Mark,'' he said while the game
was still going on.
</P>
<P>
   The value of the No. 62 home run has been estimated at $100,000,
although one anonymous voice claims he will pay 10 times that, and
there is talk of major corporations taking an interest in that
ball, which would only drive the price higher.
</P>
<P>
   The value of the ball could fluctuate like some electronics
stock in legalized gambling, that is to say, the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   What happens to the No. 62 ball if McGwire and Sosa both go on
to 63, 64, 65 homers?
</P>
<P>
   Fans might ask if they want to risk death or disfigurement for
the 62nd home run ball, particularly if its value should ``correct
itself,'' as they say on Wall Street. (``Correction'' sounds like,
``You just lost a bundle, my man,'' at least to my unsophisticated
ear.)
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, fans will see dollar signs on the 62nd home run
ball as it soars into some distant grandstand, but the fans must be
protected from themselves. The fun is only beginning.
</P>
<P>
   For the next homer, no doubt, Internal Revenue Service agents
will also be on hand, taking down Social Security numbers. This
being the litigious 1990s, one can only assume that a mighty
phalanx of personal-injury lawyers will be screeching into downtown
St. Louis from their suburban palaces.
</P>
<P>
   The safest scenario for all concerned would be for the ultimate
home run to hit the foul pole or clang off a distant facade and
come bouncing back on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe McGwire would hit an inside-the-park home run for No.
62, a 265-pound moose lumbering around the bases in pursuit of
immortality, or possibly heat stroke.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, the opposing fielder does not get to keep the
ball or barter it for a few McGwire mementos. In fact, the ball
belongs to Major League Baseball. The alternative is the next
couple of home run balls flying into humankind. Not everybody will
settle for modest rewards.
</P>
<P>
   If the Cardinals are wise, the kid's in the batting cage
immediately, before he answers all the phone calls from lawyers and
investment advisers. &QL;

BIN LADEN WAS TARGET OF U.S. RAID PLANS SINCE SPRING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Repeating for all needing.)  (bl) 
 By JAMES RISEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. intelligence officials drew up secret plans
last spring for a covert raid to capture Osama bin Laden in
Afghanistan, according to senior U.S. government officials.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said the planning began after U.S. military,
intelligence and law-enforcement officials concluded they had ample
evidence linking bin Laden to a series of anti-American terrorist
attacks in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, developed by the CIA and U.S. special forces months
before the August bombings of two U.S. embassies, called for U.S.
forces to extricate the Saudi millionaire from his hideout in
Afghanistan and bring him to justice in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials were aware of the mission, which was
ultimately shelved by the director of Central Intelligence, George
Tenet, and other senior officials because of the high risks
involved. Those included the potential for many casualties among
Americans and innocent Afghans.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton administration officials said they were still
working to develop a broad range of other options aimed at bin
Laden or to dismantle his terrorist network when bombs exploded
Aug. 7 at two East African embassies, killing 263 people, among
them 12 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The officials' accounts of the covert planning add a new
dimension to President Clinton's decision to launch a cruise
missile attack against bin Laden's training camps in Afghanistan
and a pharmaceutical factory in Sudan with suspected links to bin
Laden's efforts to obtain chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has presented the cruise missile attack as an
instance of Clinton's decisiveness in the face of terrorism. Swift
retaliation was ordered, an administration spokesman said, because
the evidence linking bin Laden to the bombings had come together
quickly and unequivocally and because the United States had
received information that he might strike again.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, a Saudi exile who lives in Afghanistan, has publicly
announced his plans to attack Americans, and U.S. authorities
believe he directed the embassy bombings.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact, officials now acknowledge, intelligence and
military officials were convinced long before the bombings that an
attack against bin Laden was justified. The bombings in Africa and
the speed with which investigators linked them to operatives
working for the Saudi exile, officials say, gave crucial political
impetus to those already advocating a counterstrike.
</P>
<P>
   The precise timing and motivation of the cruise missile attack
has raised questions, with some of Clinton's critics suggesting
that he might have acted quickly to distract attention from his
personal problems.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials point to the fact that long-term planning against
bin Laden was under way at the time of the embassy bombings as
evidence that the cruise missile attack was not hastily improvised
by the White House because of domestic political calculations.
``These things take a long time to plan and work out,'' an official
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Yet Clinton and his top aides have generally been cautious about
the use of military force and have turned down other proposed
covert raids to capture suspects overseas.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, in fact, the CIA and special forces abandoned a plan to
arrest Radovan Karadzic, the former Bosnian Serb leader charged
with war crimes, after failing to win high-level approval for the
covert operation.
</P>
<P>
   The cruise missile strikes against Afghanistan and the Sudan
were a much lower risk operation than the proposed raid against bin
Laden and did not result in any American casualties. But it also
did not bring bin Laden to heel. Administration officials said that
while some other terrorists were killed in the Afghan strike, bin
Laden escaped unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   Planning of the cruise missile operation was handled by a small
circle of Clinton's closest national security aides and remains
shrouded in secrecy. But several administration officials agreed to
describe how _ in their view _ bin Laden has become, over the last
several years, the international terrorist viewed as the most
serious threat facing American interests.
</P>
<P>
   Now said to be in his early 40s, bin Laden, an Islamic radical
and exiled scion of an influential and enormously wealthy Saudi
family, was an ally of the United States in the 1980s as a
supporter of the CIA-backed Afghan rebels battling the Soviet
occupying forces.
</P>
<P>
   He used his wealth to contribute millions of dollars to the
rebels' ultimate triumph and is said to have helped recruit and
support thousands of other Arab volunteers who joined the Afghan
cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then, we thought of him as that nice Saudi businessman
who was supporting the rebels,'' said a former CIA official
involved in the agency's Afghan program.
</P>
<P>
   But after the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, bin Laden
returned to Saudi Arabia and began to support militant Islamic
groups that opposed moderate Arab regimes.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he turned completely against the United States with the
onset of the Persian Gulf crisis after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in
1990. He saw the presence of hundreds of thousands of U.S. and
other foreign troops on Saudi soil as a deep religious affront _
the return of barbarian Crusaders to defile Islam's holy places.
</P>
<P>
   He vowed to wage war against the U.S. presence in Saudi Arabia
and the Saudi leaders who had brought them into the country.
American officials now say they believe that it was not a
coincidence that the two embassy bombings in Africa occurred Aug.
7.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years earlier on that date, the first U.S. forces landed
in Saudi Arabia as part of the effort to protect Saudi Arabia from
Iraq, which had invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, 1990.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials now believe that bin Laden began his
anti-American terror campaign soon after the end of the Persian
Gulf war, ultimately emerging as the leading individual sponsor of
anti-American terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After being forced out of Saudi Arabia, bin Laden moved to
Sudan, where he invested in a wide array of businesses and became a
close ally of Hassan Turabi, leader of the Sudan's governing party,
who provided state support for bin Laden's terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   With an inherited fortune estimated in the hundreds of millions
of dollars, bin Laden created a series of front organizations that
provided the financing and the cover for networks of terrorist
operatives. He supported terrorists in Egypt, Algeria, Yemen, the
Sudan, Lebanon and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   American analysts say they have linked bin Laden and his network
to a wide array of successful terrorist acts as well as aborted
plots, ranging from plans to kill Pope John Paul II and Clinton
during visits to Manila to the botched bombing in December 1992 of
a hotel in Yemen where U.S. soldiers bound for Somalia were
staying, a 1995 attempt to kill Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
and a 1995 car bombing in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, that killed five
U.S. soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1990s, as other terrorist groups began to fade away
and American experts began to understand bin Laden's significance,
the United States made his group a major focus of its
counterterrorism efforts.
</P>
<P>
   As early as 1993, in fact, federal officials say, bin Laden had
become the subject of FBI scrutiny after the New York World Trade
Center bombing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, a back-channel meeting was held between U.S. and
Sudanese officials in Europe, during which the U.S. officials
warned the Sudanese that evicting bin Laden was one of several
preconditions their government would have to meet before gaining
international legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, bin Laden left the Sudan for Afghanistan, but U.S.
officials insist that Sudanese leaders never severed their ties to
him.
</P>
<P>
   By 1996, bin Laden had emerged as the leading target of the
CIA's Counterterrorism Center, the government's central
clearinghouse for intelligence on terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   He was named in a secret presidential covert action order on
terrorism signed by Clinton that authorized intelligence agencies
to plan and carry out covert operations that might lead to some
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials are barred by executive order from planning an
assassination. But a ``lethal'' presidential order, or finding, is
a recognition that the action contemplated could lead to some of
those involved being killed. Such a finding would permit bin
Laden's inadvertent death in a military operation against his
network.
</P>
<P>
   To track his activities, the National Security Agency's
eavesdropping satellites were used to listen in on conversations of
his operatives throughout the world, while spy satellites that take
photographs from space allowed CIA analysts to monitor his training
camps.
</P>
<P>
   With so many intelligence resources targeted against bin Laden,
CIA analysts were able to determine that in January, he held a
meeting with leading members of his network to prepare for a new
wave of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   He soon publicly announced his intentions when he issued a
``fatwa'' or edict, calling on Muslims to kill Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were reams of intel documenting bin Laden before,'' the
embassy bombings in East Africa, a U.S. official said. Another
official said, ``We've had the book on this guy for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   At some point in this period _ officials declined to specify
precisely when _ federal prosecutors in New York obtained a sealed
indictment that charged him with terrorism crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the chief U.S. delegate to the United Nations, Bill
Richardson, traveled to Afghanistan and called on the Taliban, the
fundamentalist movement that controls most of the country, to
extradite him. The Taliban refused, and U.S. officials apparently
abandoned diplomatic efforts to negotiate the handover of bin
Laden.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of Richardson's talks with the Taliban, criminal
charges had not yet been formally issued against bin Laden in the
United States, but federal prosecutors in New York were already
working on a criminal case against him, officials said. Federal
prosecutors later did obtain a sealed indictment against bin Laden
from a New York grand jury charging him with terrorist crimes. The
indictment, returned in the months before the Aug. 7 embassy
bombings in Africa, would have provided the legal basis for bin
Laden's capture and arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Also in this period, military and intelligence officials began
drawing up plans either to capture bin Laden or to deal a blow to
his network through other options under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   While those plans received high-level attention, officials
caution that it is not clear that any of them were ready to be
carried out before the terrorist attacks in Africa. As a result,
officials stressed that there is no sense of regret among
policy-makers that they waited too long to go after bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Several officials familiar with the planning for the covert raid
to capture bin Laden inside Afghanistan also emphasized that the
risky nature of the mission, rather than any political calculation
in Washington, was behind its ultimate rejection. Some officials
said the planning needed much more work before it could have gone
forward.
</P>
<P>
   To be successful, a covert raid into Afghanistan would almost
certainly have required the assistance or acquiescence of
neighboring Pakistan, which could have provided the staging area
for launching the mission.
</P>
<P>
   But over the centuries, Afghanistan has been the deathbed of
invading armies, and the bid to extract the well-defended bin Laden
from his haven in the lawless Afghan wilds could have ended badly
for U.S. forces even with Pakistani support.

BLOOD FEUD DOMINATES CAMPAIGN SEASON IN BRONX 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the bustle of rush hour one recent afternoon, the
Espada brothers took their political campaigns to the busy
intersection of Westchester and Morrison avenues in the Bronx,
accompanied by a small army of supporters with bullhorns, bright
red campaign placards and white T-shirts bearing the images of the
brothers, Pedro Espada Jr. and Jose Espada.
</P>
<P>
   But before long, the Espada campaign had been outmaneuvered by a
convoy of sound trucks blaring the name of Ruben Diaz Jr., the
state assemblyman whom Jose Espada is trying to unseat. Suddenly,
Diaz himself appeared at the very corner where the Espadas were
busy campaigning. To this political duel, Diaz brought his own
campaign shirts and posters along with his vans, offering the
pounding rhythms of salsa.
</P>
<P>
   While this year's primary season offers a number of highly
competitive races in New York City, it would be difficult to find
any as boisterous, turbulent or bitter as the ones being waged by
the Espada brothers against Diaz and David Rosado, the state
senator who is Pedro Espada's opponent.
</P>
<P>
   The two races in the Sept. 15 primary are linked by a tangled
history of political revenge that serves as the backdrop to
campaigns that pit one family against the Bronx Democratic
organization in a blood feud. The Espadas, who contend that the
Democratic organization has tried to lock them out of politics in
the borough, are looking for a political grand slam by having two
more family members elected to office.
</P>
<P>
   The party organization is seeking to use its muscle to hold the
Espadas at bay, and its candidates in these races are seen as being
especially strong. Rosado, 56, who was an assemblyman and city
councilman before going to the Senate, is well known in the 32nd
Senate District. Diaz, 25, was a Democratic district leader before
he was elected to the Assembly two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bronx produces few challengers as formidable as Pedro
Espada Jr. Espada, 44, was a state senator for four years. But a
dispute between him and Assemblyman Roberto Ramirez, the Bronx
Democratic chairman, resulted in a break with the organization.
Espada was challenged and removed from the Democratic ballot in
1996, and Rosado was elected to replace him.
</P>
<P>
   In that same election year, Espada's son _ Pedro Gautier Espada,
then a freshman assemblyman _ was also removed from the Democratic
ballot and Diaz was elected to the Assembly seat.
</P>
<P>
   But the Espada family got its first taste of revenge last year,
when Pedro Gautier Espada, 25, was elected to the City Council.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Espada Jr., who continues to be called ``senator'' by his
associates, operates a large health clinic in the Soundview section
of the Bronx and employs hundreds of workers. He has indicated that
he will spend up to $150,000 in the primary and that Jose Espada's
Assembly contest will probably cost $75,000 _ both large amounts
for such local races.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue in the race is the indictment in June of Pedro
Espada Jr., who was arraigned with two employees on charges that
they illegally diverted $221,000 in Medicaid money to his failed
1996 re-election campaign and that of his son, Pedro Gautier
Espada.
</P>
<P>
   Espada has maintained that he is innocent and that the
indictment is politically motivated, accusing the Democratic Party
organization in the Bronx of seeking retribution for his decision
to challenge Rosado.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the voters in this district don't know who David
Rosado is,'' Espada said in an interview while campaigning with his
brother and his 67-year-old father. ``He hasn't been an articulate
or viable representative of our community. Many people still think
that I'm still their senator. And there is no question in my mind
that I will be victorious, I guarantee that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose Espada, 42, who owns an ambulette company, criticized
Diaz's term in the Assembly, saying his opponent had not
sufficiently tackled problems in the district's public schools. On
his own platform, Jose Espada said, ``We should start increasing
the standards in education.'' He added, ``If there is funding we
can bring into these public schools, we should do that.''
</P>
<P>
   To add to the campaign frenzy, Jose Espada is running for a
Democratic district leader position in one Assembly district
against Luis Sepulveda, a lawyer supported by the Democratic
organization, while in another district Councilman Pedro Gautier
Espada is running against Rosado for a party leadership post.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz is running what Bronx politicians, even the Espadas,
recognize is a vigorous campaign in the 75th Assembly District. His
image has become a fixture in the district, with blue posters
bearing his picture seemingly at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   Although Diaz is spending less than his opponent _ about $40,000
by his own account _ he, too, has a network of family support. He
is often joined on the campaign trail by his wife, his brother, his
mother and his father, the Rev. Ruben Diaz, a Pentecostal minister
who runs three nonprofit centers for the elderly and is the leader
of an association of Hispanic ministers. In addition, Diaz is
receiving strong assistance from the Bronx Democratic organization,
with Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president, as his campaign
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz said he was proud of his two years in the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our office has dealt with the concerns of close to 9,000
constituents since I've been in office,'' Diaz said. In his
campaign speeches, he discusses what he calls the nitty-gritty of
elective politics, from getting a natural-gas boiler in Public
School 107 to adding speed bumps in the quiet, Harding Park section
of the district.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have accomplished tangible things that affect the daily
lives of the residents,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosado has run a somewhat less visible campaign, in part, he
said, because of weeks he took off to recuperate from surgery.
Since then, he said, he has campaigned daily at subway stops and
mailed more than 200,000 pieces of campaign literature to residents
of the Senate district, which includes the neighborhoods of Mott
Haven, Hunts Point, Soundview, Castle Hill and Parkchester.
</P>
<P>
   Rosado counters his opponent's criticism by contending that
Espada, while in his last year in office, missed roughly half the
votes. ``He was a no-show in the Senate,'' Rosado said. ``As for my
own performance, I have been dealing with the many concerns of my
constituents. As a Democrat, I'm in the minority in the Senate. So,
under the circumstances, you do as much as you can. I give myself a
B-plus.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosado said that by primary day he will likely have spent up to
$80,000 on his re-election campaign.

MIXED MESSAGE IS PUT FORWARD IN HARLEM RALLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAN BARRY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With a turnout far smaller than organizers had hoped,
and with police officers lining every block, Harlem served as host
Saturday to a black youth rally that galvanized some with its calls
for unity and alienated others with the anti-white, antisemitic
message of its chief organizer, Khallid Abdul Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
   Several thousand people flowed past the clusters of police
officers everywhere to convene at Malcolm X Boulevard and West
118th Street, where a large stage had been erected overnight. They
chanted ``Black Power,'' waved black nationalist flags and taunted
police officers for limiting pedestrian traffic on some streets
with shouts of ``These are our streets!''
</P>
<P>
   Within the first 30 minutes of speeches from the stage, the
crowds _ which appeared to be closer to 20,000 than the 50,000
organizers had predicted _ received the kind of mixed message that
has disturbed Harlem's political leaders and prompted Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani to denounce the rally, called the Million Youth March, as
a ``hate march.''
</P>
<P>
   First, a young boy identified as Little Brother Damien of the
Harlem Boys Choir urged understanding between generations of black
people: ``We've got to change the way we treat our mothers and
fathers and the ways our mothers and fathers treat their sons and
daughters.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy's plea received prolonged applause. Then another speaker
introduced Malik Zulu Shabazz, a lawyer and close aide to Muhammad,
as the man who ``gave Jews hell in the newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care that you call yourself Crip, I don't care that
you call yourself Blood,'' Shabazz said, referring to some of the
prominent gangs that had been invited to the rally. ``You are the
chosen people of God. I don't care what the Jews say. You are the
only people who have been in bondage for over 400 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Shabazz also ridiculed Giuliani, whose administration had tried
to thwart the event, and whose unpopularity among some in the crowd
was evident in a sign being waved near the stage. ``Waste Nazi
Giuliani,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   `` Giuliani,'' Shabazz said, ``you have no power over your
former slaves.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who spent the morning at the Latin-American Little
League World Series in Brooklyn, expressed only delight that as of
early Saturday afternoon, the rally was significantly smaller than
its organizers had hoped and appeared to be generally peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it shows me is that our strategy has worked,'' Giuliani
said. ``The `Million Person March' is going to be some
infinitesimal percentage of that `million person.' '' He went on,
``I think most kids in New York City _ white, black, Hispanic,
Asian, whatever the group _ they'd rather play baseball today than
march under the banner of a hater.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's event culminated a monthslong quarrel between
organizers and the city. The ostensible question centered on the
rights to the use of the streets of Harlem, but an undercurrent of
racial tension has flowed through the dispute. For the last several
weeks, the mayor has denounced the rally as a ``hate march'' while
Muhammad has demonstrated his ability to espouse anti-white
sentiments in the engaging cadences of a preacher.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Two city councilmen from Harlem, Stanley Michels and Guillermo
Linares, attended the rally and branded it a failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The turnout here today is clearly a rejection of what Khallid
Muhammad has said and the racism he stands for,'' Michels said.
Part of the reason the rally's organizers failed, he said, is that
they went around elected officials _ even to the point of insulting
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way it could have been a success even if they had
approached us,'' he said. ``The message they represent would have
still spelled failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Linares concurred. ``To the credit of this community, they
understand the difference between a positive message and racism,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But state Sen. David Paterson and other Harlem officials were
clearly more anxious about the possibility of a clash between the
police and the participants. Early Saturday morning they sent out
more than 500 volunteers _ some wearing shirts saying ``Harlem
Community Observer'' _ to act as mediators and to direct people who
needed help finding bathrooms and water.
</P>
<P>
   By early afternoon, Paterson was in his office on West 125th
Street, receiving reports from the field _ and he was not happy
about what he was hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're exhorting the crowd to violence, which is barbaric and
just inhuman,'' he said. ``There's a large gathering of young
people. Many of them feel intimidated and harassed by the full
deployment of police. Given that intimidation, for the speakers to
be advocating the shooting of white people is loathsome. And yet my
feeling is that this visible presence of police artillery has in
many senses provoked the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that the marchers have been caught between this
firestorm of force vs. inflammatory rhetoric. And I just pray that
the gathering will disperse peacefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those attending the rally were clearly angry about how
the police were handling things,
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the million cop march, not the million youth march,''
said Michael White, 36, who lives in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section
of Brooklyn. ``All the police are on the inside, we're all on the
outside. It shouldn't be like that.''
</P>
<P>
   LeShea Brown, 19, said police officers stopped her at 121st
Street and Fifth Avenue and said she would have to turn around
unless she could show that she lived in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to lie,'' she said. ``I had to cry and lie just to walk
through my own community. I pay taxes here. It's not fair for
Giuliani to treat us this way. You can't tell me that any of this
would happen if this were the St. Patrick's Day parade.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute between the city and the rally organizers began in
January, when organizers filed vague plans for a Million Youth
March, somewhere in the city, on Sept. 19. But as the months
passed, those vague plans evolved into a formal request for a
12-hour event on Sept. 5 _ the first day of the Labor Day weekend _
for 29 blocks stretching up Malcolm X Boulevard in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   The city denied the request, saying it would cause excessive
congestion at a time when the city's complement of police officers
was already stretched thin by vacations and other weekend events.
It suggested Sept. 19 as an alternative time, and Randalls Island
and Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx as alternative locations.
Shortly afterward, Muhammad suggested that he would hold the event
with or without a permit, and raised the possibility that gang
members who attend the event might, if provoked, resort to
violence.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, what had been a quiet debate between the city and
the organizers became public, surprising many in Harlem who had no
idea that their community was being considered as the site of a
large rally. The neighborhood's political leaders criticized
Muhammad for speaking of black unity while also failing to tell
Harlem of his plans. They said he had placed them in the awkward
position of supporting the empowerment of black youth _ the stated
purpose of the rally _ while decrying the leader's antisemitic,
anti-white message.
</P>
<P>
   But Harlem's leaders also complained that the mayor had not kept
them apprised, which they said reflected his poor relations with
the city's black community. And they said that by mixing the denial
of the permit with his denunciation of Muhammad as a hate-monger,
Giuliani had failed to recognize the complexities posed by the
situation, and had only aggravated tensions.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's standard response to this charge was that he could
not separate the message from the messenger, a point he shared
again on Friday. ``We're hopeful that most people will make the
point that they're against hatred and they will not separate the
leader from the march and therefore not join in the march and
therefore not march under the banner of anti-white, anti-Jewish,
anti-Catholic hatred, anti-anything-else hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   Late last month, the organizers filed a lawsuit in U.S. District
Court for the Southern District in Manhattan, arguing that the
city's denial of their permit had denied their constitutional
rights to free speech. A federal judge eventually agreed, and
suggested in his ruling that the city had the wherewithal to handle
the 12-hour, 29-block march.
</P>
<P>
   But last week a three-judge panel for the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals drastically reduced the scope of the planned rally,
saying that while the organizers have a constitutional right to
demonstrate, they do not have a right to dictate to the city the
terms of such a gathering. After a lawyer for the organizers
acknowledged that they expected only 50,000 people to attend _
rather than the 1 million to 3 million originally touted _ the
panel narrowed the rally to just four hours, and only six blocks.
</P>
<P>
   That decision left both the city and the organizers declaring
victory and promising to cooperate. But in the days leading to the
event, the organizers declined to reveal pertinent information
about the rally to anyone, including city officials, who complained
that misleading information about the event was still being
circulated on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery ended Friday morning, with the sight of the stage
looming over a corner of Malcolm X Boulevard that reflects the
struggles of the Harlem community. To the west of the stage were
two apartment buildings: one had blooming potted plants visible
from the windows; the other was mostly abandoned, with six stories
of boarded-up windows.
</P>
<P>
   Participants included hundreds of people who identified
themselves as members of various organizations: the Youth for
Social Change, from Durham, N.C.; the Workfare Workers; the Black
Latin Association of the Bronx. Its leader had a grenade strapped
to his shirt. He declined to say whether it was live.
</P>
<P>
   Jamille Jones, 17, of Newark, who had joined 50 other people in
taking the PATH train from New Jersey and then the A train to
Harlem, wore a black beret and pins depicting black panthers. He
spoke admiringly of Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't hold his tongue,'' the young man said. ``He tells
it like it is, about what they're doing to us. He's filling our
anger.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether he was bothered by Muhammad's antisemitic
rhetoric, Jones said:
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean, calling the Jews `bloodsuckers'? Well, maybe they
should analyze it, and think, `Why is he calling us bloodsuckers?'

TENNIS COLUMN: WORKING WITH YOUTH IN THE ASHE TRADITION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.)  (lb) 
 By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rodney Harmon grew up in Richmond, Va., three houses
away from tennis courts that, like the main court at the U.S. Open,
are now named for Arthur Ashe. A life in tennis, though not likely,
was at least a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lived on the same side of town as Arthur; my grandmother
knew his mother, and everyone there knew tennis because of him,''
Harmon said Saturday. ``So even though I wasn't from a wealthy
family and it wasn't like anyone said, `Oh, you should take tennis
lessons,' it wasn't like I had to go very far to play some
tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   He walked into the park one day, into an Ashe-inspired urban
grass-roots program, and didn't come out until he was good enough
to receive a scholarship to a rich kids' tennis school, the
Bollettieri Academy. Then it was on to Southern Methodist
University and the men's pro tour for a half-dozen years, until
1986.
</P>
<P>
   He never set the world on fire, but he did make it, with
assistance, which is the only way for an African-American kid from
a poor or lower-middle-class family, whose father isn't one in a
million.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't, in other words, Richard Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``An aberration,'' Harmon said of the man who raised two tennis
players in an area of Los Angeles, Compton, not exactly known for
serve and volley. ``You're not going to find many minority parents
who will step in and take over the development. It's a daunting
task.''
</P>
<P>
   The tournament was a week old for everyone else, but the Open
was just getting started Saturday for Harmon, the 37-year-old
director of multicultural development for the U.S. Tennis
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the minority juniors he has been watching over the past
13 months _ like Levar Harper-Griffith out of Brooklyn _ were
checking in, preparing to go to work Sunday on the outer regions of
the National Tennis Center, dreaming of the show courts, where
Williams, almost miraculously, has steered two daughters, all by
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Serena Williams failed to survive the third round, bumped from
her first Open by, of all people, Irina Spirlea on Friday night.
But her big sister Venus sauntered into Ashe Stadium on Saturday
and toyed with Larisa Neiland for a few games before the veteran
Latvian's back began to hurt and she retired.
</P>
<P>
   Venus Williams was wearing the third of seven sleeveless outfits
_ blue top, yellow skirt _ that she brought to New York, a message
that she likes her chances of making her second straight final. In
three rounds here, she has lost a grand total of five games. She
could lose before the semis, especially in the quarters, to Arantxa
Sanchez Vicario or Anna Kournikova, but that's not the point.
</P>
<P>
   When she showed up here for the first time last year, you could
feel the country-clubbers just waiting for Venus Williams to fail.
She had snubbed the juniors, their rankings, their lifestyle. The
fact that Venus Williams, one year later, is now taken for granted
as a late-round fixture is remarkable in itself, though it doesn't
exactly foretell a generation of inner-city kids about to be
home-schooled for a career in tennis by Dad.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it has been years since Richard Williams and his
daughters actually lived in anything close to a city. Their
official residence in the Women's Tennis Association player guide
is listed as Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., heart of American tennis
country, an important context to some bizarre commentary by the
Williamses during the first week of the Open.
</P>
<P>
   First, Serena volleyed contentiously with reporters over the
origin of the word ``ghetto.'' Then her father told a New York Post
reporter that he thought the Open should be moved to Compton.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Richard Williams should roll down the window of the car
shuttling him in and out of the National Tennis Center, which
happens to be in the heart of an area rich in minority culture. The
problem with the Open is not where it is; it is how to bring into
the sport working-class people who don't have an advocate as
skilled and single-minded as he is.
</P>
<P>
   That's part of Harmon's job, despite some recent criticism that
the USTA was more interested in a ceremonial position and had not
provided the necessary money and staffing.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would have a budget of about $500,000, but conceded
that he could spend a whole lot more than that. For the serious
junior player, he said, it costs about $30,000 a year for the
lessons, the coaching, the travel. His goal is to spread his wealth
around as much as he can, but then most players operate on budgets
that are too tight. And since the boys tend to develop late, it's
difficult to pinpoint the best prospects when they are 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at all the great players, someone _ a parent or
coach _ took over their development when they were still very
young,'' Harmon said. ``We're trying to be that for the minority
community. But it's not easy. In fact, it's exhausting.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Ashe never gave up, though. Harmon can trace his job, and
his tennis life, to that.

IVANISEVIC AND RAFTER SET FOR SMASHING MATCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ROBIN FINN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Eager to get down to what for him has historically
been the risky business of surviving the first week of the U.S.
Open, Goran Ivanisevic clocked in early enough at the National
Tennis Center before Saturday morning's straight-set dismissal of
Paul Haarhuis to check his mailbox.
</P>
<P>
   Inside it, the game's most erratic shotmaster found a most
unusual gift: an early birthday present from a female fan. His
admirer wanted him to have something different when he celebrated
his 27th birthday on Sept. 13, which also happens to be the date
that this 1998 Open will appoint its men's champion.
</P>
<P>
   Given a choice of birthday presents, Ivanisevic, who is not
quite resigned to sidekick status in the game's record books as the
best player never to win a Grand Slam tournament, would select the
men's title.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of the question I've been hearing for the last six
or seven years, always the same question, and always the same
stupid answer,'' the 14th-seeded Ivanisevic said after firing 21
aces in the 7-6 (7-5), 6-3, 6-4 victory that left him four rounds
short of collecting this Grand Slam event's highest honor. ``I know
I'm maybe the best player never to win a Grand Slam, but I'm
trying. There's a chance I can win this one.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ivanisevic said the odds of his proudly displaying the
Open's trophy back home for show-and-tell in Split, Croatia, were
much better than his flashing around the shiny new handcuffs that
drew a big crowd, including his next opponent, the Open's defending
champion, Patrick Rafter, when he unveiled them in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty weird stuff,'' Ivanisevic said about the first
pair of handcuffs he had ever seen, much less owned. ``In Croatia,
things like that you hide.''
</P>
<P>
   But invisible handcuffs like the ones that have clamped down and
prevented him from winning any of the three Wimbledon finales he
has reached, including this year's loss to Pete Sampras, have
wrought a kind of mental bondage Ivanisevic has been only too
familiar with.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough when I have to play against both me and the other
guy,'' Ivanisevic said of his history of self-destructive behavior
at Grand Slam events, particularly here at the Open, where he had
taken a first-round dive in three of his last four appearances.
``But lately I'm playing most of the time against the other guy,
not against myself.''
</P>
<P>
   After putting an end to a five-match losing streak against the
32-year-old Haarhuis, Ivanisevic contended that he is playing so
superbly at the Open that he intends to use serves, volleys and
passing shots to handcuff his pal Rafter in their Round of 16
clash. Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's maybe the best I've ever played at the U.S. Open,'' he
said of his form through three rounds, ``but it doesn't mean
anything. He's confident, I'm confident, but somebody has to win,
so it's going to be interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivanisevic defeated Rafter in the fourth round at Wimbledon in
1996 in their only previous meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty confident in my head,'' Ivanisevic said, ``but
sometimes I get a little bit messed up there. I have to bang it,
then everything comes together.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafter, after receiving a fright when he opened his title
defense of his first Grand Slam crown by scrambling out of a
five-set trap laid by Hicham Arazi, has conscientiously cruised
through the subsequent rounds in straight sets.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's 66-minute demolition of David Nainkin, the
188th-ranked qualifier who knocked out Gustavo Kuerten, the 1997
French Open champion, was representative of Rafter's Open game
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never feel badly about winning,'' the third-seeded Rafter
said. ``You want to get on and get off the court as quick as you
possibly can, conserve your energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafter did just that in Saturday's 6-1, 6-1, 6-1 victory, his
quickest ever at a Grand Slam event, which moved him into the Round
of 16 opposite Ivanisevic.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After sharing a laugh at Ivanisevic's mailbox before their
respective third-round victories, Rafter promised that he and the
iconoclastic Croat would be all business in the fourth round.
``When we get on, there will be no love lost,'' Rafter said.
``We'll be doing our business, and when we get off, we'll be good
mates. He's crazy, likes to have fun, and that sort of suits in
well with my personality.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Rafter, Ivanisevic wasn't kidding when he predicted
that this Grand Slam tournament could be the one where he finally
breaks through the barrier that has kept him from capturing a major
championship. ``He's knuckled down this year,'' Rafter said, ``he's
got his mind on the job in the last three or four months.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafter has done much the same thing this summer after an
indifferent start to the 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a dangerous man,'' Rafter added about Ivanisevic. ``He
can do anything and nothing on a given day; when he's on, he's on.
There's not too many better players running around than Goran when
he's on.''
</P>
<P>
   MATCH POINTS
</P>
<P>
   Fifth-seeded Venus Williams, last year's runner-up, defeated
Larisa Neiland, after the 32-year-old Latvian retired from their
match after just five games. The 85th-ranked Neiland has been
bothered by chronic back trouble, and it flared up Saturday just 13
minutes into the match.

MOYA WIN OVER CHANG TAKES TOLL ON BOTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also TEN-USOPEN) 
(mk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The first thing Carlos Moya did after Michael Chang's
final backhand return flew long was to drop to his knees, which is
a reaction more commonly associated with winning a Grand Slam
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   All Moya had done was win a second-round match, but there were
good reasons for his temporary loss of balance. He had saved three
match points; he had erased a two-set deficit for the first time in
his career, and he had beaten a tenacious American whose record at
the U.S. Open takes a lot longer to examine than his own.
</P>
<P>
   Chang first played here in 1987 and has reached two
quarterfinals, two semifinals and a final. Moya first played in
1996 and had never reached the third round until Friday night, or,
more accurately, Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Moya did not finish off his 3-6, 1-6, 7-6 (7-5), 6-4, 6-3
victory at the National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows, N.Y.,
until 1:33 a.m. The match had lasted 3 hours 51 minutes, longer
than any match yet this year at the Open, and it had exacted a toll
on both men.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am probably going to dream about missed chances,'' said
Chang, who was relentless in the first two sets but failed to
convert any of his three match points on Moya's serve in the 10th
game of the third set.
</P>
<P>
   Moya had to wait some time to get the chance to dream. After
donning a T-shirt on which he had scrawled a birthday message to
his mother, he slumped into his courtside chair and draped a towel
over his head. He was beginning to cramp in his left thigh and
lower back, and by the time he reached the locker room, he was
stretched out with the physical therapists working overtime. At
2:15 a.m., he was still flat on his back on a training table,
wincing occasionally as a masseur kneaded his leg. ``My head felt
fine, which is not always the case in matches like this for me,''
Moya said, ``but my body was having some trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Moya had a memorable spring, winning one of the most lucrative
events on the tour in Monte Carlo and then winning his first Grand
Slam event at the French Open in Paris six weeks later. But with
the change of seasons and the change of surface from European clay
to North American cement, he has struggled: losing in the first
round in Cincinnati to Jerome Golmard, a Frenchman who is no
household name even in France, and losing in the first round in
Indianapolis to Thomas Johansson, who would have trouble drawing a
crowd in his native Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Moya does draw in Spain, but though he spends the bulk of his
time training on clay in Barcelona with Alex Corretja, Felix
Mantilla, Albert Costa and the other members of Spain's predictably
nicknamed ``Armada,'' he is no clay-court specialist. His first
Grand Slam success came at the Australian Open in 1997, where he
defeated Chang in the semifinals in straight sets on the Rebound
Ace hardcourt in Melbourne before losing to Pete Sampras in the
final.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, shortly before the U.S. Open, he won the warm-up
tournament in Long Island, defeating the eventual Open champion
Patrick Rafter in the final. But an arm injury, aggravated in that
match, contributed to his first-round loss to Guillaume Raoux in
the main event.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Moya is healthy. ``This was not Carlos' greatest
match,'' said his coach, Josep Perlas, of the Chang comeback. ``But
I think in the situation he was in, where he hasn't played many
matches lately, he showed lots of patience and lots of poise.''

NEW CHICAGO RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT IS BORN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JILL SCHACHNER CHANEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ A handful of developers are creating a new residential
neighborhood in a former industrial area of this city, just blocks
away from the Loop central business district.
</P>
<P>
   Called the Fulton River District, the area embraces about 10
square blocks. Within the next three years it will have as many as
3,000 units of newly constructed town houses and apartments in low-
and high-rise buildings as well as loft conversions, according to
current plans.
</P>
<P>
   The area is bounded by the north branch of the Chicago River on
the east side and the city's wholesale meat and produce market on
the southwest side.
</P>
<P>
   Developers are attracted to it because of the availability of
relatively large tracts of vacant land so close to the Loop, said
Tracy Cross of Tracy Cross &AMP; Associates, real-estate market
analysts in Schaumburg, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Because developers do not have to raze existing structures for
their new projects, prices for newly constructed town houses and
apartments are approximately $40 to $50 per square foot less than
comparable properties being built in established city neighborhoods
like Lincoln Park or Lakeview, Cross said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would never have been able to afford our place in Lincoln
Park,'' said Beth Wexler, 28, a real estate agent with Jameson
Realty Group in Chicago who, with her husband, Michael, bought a
2,200-square-foot town house in Fulton Station, one of the
district's new developments. ``We paid approximately $150 per
square foot. In Lincoln Park we could not have touched this same
place for under $200 per square foot.''
</P>
<P>
   The construction of the first phase of Fulton Station, which
will consist of 24 town houses and 80 apartments in two seven-story
buildings, is two-thirds finished, said David Ruttenberg, a
developer with the Belgravia Group.
</P>
<P>
   Closings on two of the town houses have occurred and more will
take place at a rate of one a week. The two apartment buildings
also are nearly completed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruttenberg said he offered all the town houses when he began
sales in the spring of 1997, and all of them now are sold. Only 104
of the 174 apartments planned in the total project have been
offered for sale so far. Of those, 42 are under sales contract.
</P>
<P>
   The town houses range in price from $300,000 to $350,000, while
the apartments are priced from $142,000 for a one-bedroom unit to
$450,000 for three-bedroom duplex units on the top floors of the
mid-rise apartment buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The second phase of the development, which will be the
completion of two additional apartment buildings with a total of 96
units, is financed. Construction is slated to begin on the third
building this month, with completion scheduled for the fall of
1999. The fourth building should be completed by the winter of
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Ruttenberg does not intend to expand the development beyond the
current plans, in part because of the need to heavily landscape the
three-acre parcel of vacant industrial property he is developing,
including the creation of two parks to help change the feel of the
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is necessary to attract the buyers that we want to come
here sooner or later,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The Fulton River District still has a distinctly gritty,
industrial feel from the presence of working train tracks bisecting
the area, numerous abandoned industrial sites and a few remaining
working factories, including Blommer Chocolate Co., which permeates
the area each day with the scent of its product.
</P>
<P>
   At Kinzie Park, a new $120 million development that borders the
Chicago River on one side and commuter-train tracks on the other,
developers plan to build 350 units on a six-acre parcel to create a
``garden in the city'' effect to attract buyers to their gated
community of luxury town houses and apartments.
</P>
<P>
   The development will have brick-paved streets, fountains and a
landscaped walkway along parts of the property that border the
river, said Ronald Shipka Sr., president of Enterprise Development
Co., which is developing the property in a joint venture with
Habitat Co. of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for Kinzie Park call for 90 town houses, a 39-story
apartment building with 186 units and a seven-story apartment
building with 54 units. Sales prices range from $155,000 for a
one-bedroom apartment in the high-rise to nearly $1 million for a
4,000-square-foot town house bordering the river.
</P>
<P>
   Shipka and his development partners say they believe that living
on or near the Chicago River will soon be considered an amenity for
which buyers will be willing to pay more, much as they do for
proximity to Lake Michigan. The prices for the riverfront town
houses have increased by $150,000 since they began selling last
fall.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 172 of Kinzie Park's units, including 45 town houses and
46 apartments in the mid-rise building, have been sold. Buyers
include young families, professionals who work in the Loop and
older married couples moving back to the city after their children
have moved out of their suburban homes.
</P>
<P>
   Because the entire project has been financed, according to
Shipka, the entire project is already under construction. The
mid-rise apartment building and 45 of the town houses will be
completed first, with the closings scheduled for spring. The
high-rise building will be completed in the year 2000.

</P>
<P>
   These gated, luxury developments are a far cry from the first
projects in the area, said Michael Lerner, president of MCZ
Development Corp., who is credited with starting the development
trend in the Fulton River District.
</P>
<P>
   Lerner began converting timber lofts out of vacant warehouses
and other storage buildings in the district three years ago on a
hunch. He had seen loft buyers stretch to move to other undeveloped
areas. ``This area was remote, but it did have the proximity to
downtown Chicago,'' he said. ``But the building just stood out
there alone. There were no neighborhood amenities or conversions.''
</P>
<P>
   His success in selling out the first two projects in the area _
the 112-unit China Club Lofts and the 180-unit Clinton Street Lofts
_ convinced him and other developers that the Fulton River District
was ripe for more expensive development.
</P>
<P>
   Lerner is now completing the conversion of Randolph Place, the
former headquarters of Chicago and Northwestern Railroad, into a
$100 million development of 350 apartments and a mix of commercial
uses including a restaurant, spa and convenience store.
</P>
<P>
   All but 10 of the units are sold, he reported.
</P>
<P>
   As buyers continue to flock to the Fulton River District, other
developers are investing in more expensive residential projects.
The Levy Organization recently sold almost a third of its vacant
3.3-acre parcel of riverfront property, where the Chicago River
branches north, to Bejco Development Corp., which will build a
38-story apartment building and four riverfront town houses that
may be as large as 6,000 square feet each.
</P>
<P>
   Bejco's project will be linked to the Levy Organization's
planned commercial development of two office buildings.
</P>
<P>
   B.J. Spathies, president of Bejco, said the high-rise would
house 140 to 160 apartments, to be sold at an average of $250 per
square foot when they go on the market this fall. All the units
will face the river, with unobstructed views of downtown Chicago,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Spathies says she believes the growth of the area can
support the prices she plans to charge. ``It is a vibrant area,''
she said. ``A lot of funky things are happening there. It also is
an alternative to the congestion of Michigan Avenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Some buyers also see nothing but a rosy future for the Fulton
River District.
</P>
<P>
   Perry Good, an insurance agent who is single, said he bought a
two-bedroom apartment at Fulton Station because he believed it
would be a good investment. Three years ago, Good, 34, bought a
loft apartment on the east side of the Chicago River in a
then-developing neighborhood called River North and ``watched the
area go crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in two years this area will be more residential than
River North.'' he said. ``It will be totally different.''

BIN LADEN WAS TARGET OF U.S. RAID PLANS SINCE SPRING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Repeating for all needing.)  (bl) 
 By JAMES RISEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. intelligence officials drew up secret plans
last spring for a covert raid to capture Osama bin Laden in
Afghanistan, according to senior U.S. government officials.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said the planning began after U.S. military,
intelligence and law-enforcement officials concluded they had ample
evidence linking bin Laden to a series of anti-American terrorist
attacks in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, developed by the CIA and U.S. special forces months
before the August bombings of two U.S. embassies, called for U.S.
forces to extricate the Saudi millionaire from his hideout in
Afghanistan and bring him to justice in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials were aware of the mission, which was
ultimately shelved by the director of Central Intelligence, George
Tenet, and other senior officials because of the high risks
involved. Those included the potential for many casualties among
Americans and innocent Afghans.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton administration officials said they were still
working to develop a broad range of other options aimed at bin
Laden or to dismantle his terrorist network when bombs exploded
Aug. 7 at two East African embassies, killing 263 people, among
them 12 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The officials' accounts of the covert planning add a new
dimension to President Clinton's decision to launch a cruise
missile attack against bin Laden's training camps in Afghanistan
and a pharmaceutical factory in Sudan with suspected links to bin
Laden's efforts to obtain chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has presented the cruise missile attack as an
instance of Clinton's decisiveness in the face of terrorism. Swift
retaliation was ordered, an administration spokesman said, because
the evidence linking bin Laden to the bombings had come together
quickly and unequivocally and because the United States had
received information that he might strike again.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, a Saudi exile who lives in Afghanistan, has publicly
announced his plans to attack Americans, and U.S. authorities
believe he directed the embassy bombings.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact, officials now acknowledge, intelligence and
military officials were convinced long before the bombings that an
attack against bin Laden was justified. The bombings in Africa and
the speed with which investigators linked them to operatives
working for the Saudi exile, officials say, gave crucial political
impetus to those already advocating a counterstrike.
</P>
<P>
   The precise timing and motivation of the cruise missile attack
has raised questions, with some of Clinton's critics suggesting
that he might have acted quickly to distract attention from his
personal problems.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials point to the fact that long-term planning against
bin Laden was under way at the time of the embassy bombings as
evidence that the cruise missile attack was not hastily improvised
by the White House because of domestic political calculations.
``These things take a long time to plan and work out,'' an official
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Yet Clinton and his top aides have generally been cautious about
the use of military force and have turned down other proposed
covert raids to capture suspects overseas.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, in fact, the CIA and special forces abandoned a plan to
arrest Radovan Karadzic, the former Bosnian Serb leader charged
with war crimes, after failing to win high-level approval for the
covert operation.
</P>
<P>
   The cruise missile strikes against Afghanistan and the Sudan
were a much lower risk operation than the proposed raid against bin
Laden and did not result in any American casualties. But it also
did not bring bin Laden to heel. Administration officials said that
while some other terrorists were killed in the Afghan strike, bin
Laden escaped unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   Planning of the cruise missile operation was handled by a small
circle of Clinton's closest national security aides and remains
shrouded in secrecy. But several administration officials agreed to
describe how _ in their view _ bin Laden has become, over the last
several years, the international terrorist viewed as the most
serious threat facing American interests.
</P>
<P>
   Now said to be in his early 40s, bin Laden, an Islamic radical
and exiled scion of an influential and enormously wealthy Saudi
family, was an ally of the United States in the 1980s as a
supporter of the CIA-backed Afghan rebels battling the Soviet
occupying forces.
</P>
<P>
   He used his wealth to contribute millions of dollars to the
rebels' ultimate triumph and is said to have helped recruit and
support thousands of other Arab volunteers who joined the Afghan
cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then, we thought of him as that nice Saudi businessman
who was supporting the rebels,'' said a former CIA official
involved in the agency's Afghan program.
</P>
<P>
   But after the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, bin Laden
returned to Saudi Arabia and began to support militant Islamic
groups that opposed moderate Arab regimes.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he turned completely against the United States with the
onset of the Persian Gulf crisis after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in
1990. He saw the presence of hundreds of thousands of U.S. and
other foreign troops on Saudi soil as a deep religious affront _
the return of barbarian Crusaders to defile Islam's holy places.
</P>
<P>
   He vowed to wage war against the U.S. presence in Saudi Arabia
and the Saudi leaders who had brought them into the country.
American officials now say they believe that it was not a
coincidence that the two embassy bombings in Africa occurred Aug.
7.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years earlier on that date, the first U.S. forces landed
in Saudi Arabia as part of the effort to protect Saudi Arabia from
Iraq, which had invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, 1990.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials now believe that bin Laden began his
anti-American terror campaign soon after the end of the Persian
Gulf war, ultimately emerging as the leading individual sponsor of
anti-American terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After being forced out of Saudi Arabia, bin Laden moved to
Sudan, where he invested in a wide array of businesses and became a
close ally of Hassan Turabi, leader of the Sudan's governing party,
who provided state support for bin Laden's terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   With an inherited fortune estimated in the hundreds of millions
of dollars, bin Laden created a series of front organizations that
provided the financing and the cover for networks of terrorist
operatives. He supported terrorists in Egypt, Algeria, Yemen, the
Sudan, Lebanon and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   American analysts say they have linked bin Laden and his network
to a wide array of successful terrorist acts as well as aborted
plots, ranging from plans to kill Pope John Paul II and Clinton
during visits to Manila to the botched bombing in December 1992 of
a hotel in Yemen where U.S. soldiers bound for Somalia were
staying, a 1995 attempt to kill Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
and a 1995 car bombing in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, that killed five
U.S. soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1990s, as other terrorist groups began to fade away
and American experts began to understand bin Laden's significance,
the United States made his group a major focus of its
counterterrorism efforts.
</P>
<P>
   As early as 1993, in fact, federal officials say, bin Laden had
become the subject of FBI scrutiny after the New York World Trade
Center bombing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, a back-channel meeting was held between U.S. and
Sudanese officials in Europe, during which the U.S. officials
warned the Sudanese that evicting bin Laden was one of several
preconditions their government would have to meet before gaining
international legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, bin Laden left the Sudan for Afghanistan, but U.S.
officials insist that Sudanese leaders never severed their ties to
him.
</P>
<P>
   By 1996, bin Laden had emerged as the leading target of the
CIA's Counterterrorism Center, the government's central
clearinghouse for intelligence on terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   He was named in a secret presidential covert action order on
terrorism signed by Clinton that authorized intelligence agencies
to plan and carry out covert operations that might lead to some
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials are barred by executive order from planning an
assassination. But a ``lethal'' presidential order, or finding, is
a recognition that the action contemplated could lead to some of
those involved being killed. Such a finding would permit bin
Laden's inadvertent death in a military operation against his
network.
</P>
<P>
   To track his activities, the National Security Agency's
eavesdropping satellites were used to listen in on conversations of
his operatives throughout the world, while spy satellites that take
photographs from space allowed CIA analysts to monitor his training
camps.
</P>
<P>
   With so many intelligence resources targeted against bin Laden,
CIA analysts were able to determine that in January, he held a
meeting with leading members of his network to prepare for a new
wave of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   He soon publicly announced his intentions when he issued a
``fatwa'' or edict, calling on Muslims to kill Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were reams of intel documenting bin Laden before,'' the
embassy bombings in East Africa, a U.S. official said. Another
official said, ``We've had the book on this guy for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   At some point in this period _ officials declined to specify
precisely when _ federal prosecutors in New York obtained a sealed
indictment that charged him with terrorism crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the chief U.S. delegate to the United Nations, Bill
Richardson, traveled to Afghanistan and called on the Taliban, the
fundamentalist movement that controls most of the country, to
extradite him. The Taliban refused, and U.S. officials apparently
abandoned diplomatic efforts to negotiate the handover of bin
Laden.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of Richardson's talks with the Taliban, criminal
charges had not yet been formally issued against bin Laden in the
United States, but federal prosecutors in New York were already
working on a criminal case against him, officials said. Federal
prosecutors later did obtain a sealed indictment against bin Laden
from a New York grand jury charging him with terrorist crimes. The
indictment, returned in the months before the Aug. 7 embassy
bombings in Africa, would have provided the legal basis for bin
Laden's capture and arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Also in this period, military and intelligence officials began
drawing up plans either to capture bin Laden or to deal a blow to
his network through other options under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   While those plans received high-level attention, officials
caution that it is not clear that any of them were ready to be
carried out before the terrorist attacks in Africa. As a result,
officials stressed that there is no sense of regret among
policy-makers that they waited too long to go after bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Several officials familiar with the planning for the covert raid
to capture bin Laden inside Afghanistan also emphasized that the
risky nature of the mission, rather than any political calculation
in Washington, was behind its ultimate rejection. Some officials
said the planning needed much more work before it could have gone
forward.
</P>
<P>
   To be successful, a covert raid into Afghanistan would almost
certainly have required the assistance or acquiescence of
neighboring Pakistan, which could have provided the staging area
for launching the mission.
</P>
<P>
   But over the centuries, Afghanistan has been the deathbed of
invading armies, and the bid to extract the well-defended bin Laden
from his haven in the lawless Afghan wilds could have ended badly
for U.S. forces even with Pakistani support.

<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ Busloads of grieving relatives made their
way Saturday morning to the rocky spit of land closest to the
sunken wreckage of Swissair Flight 111.
</P>
<P>
   The first buses began driving up the narrow, winding road to
Peggy's Cove, a fishing village and tourist attraction about 20
miles southwest of here, early Saturday. The somber passengers,
nearly all clutching flowers, walked past the white light house
with its red top and made their way onto a jetty, where the surf
pounded against the rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Some were followed by chaplains, others by Red Cross volunteers
carrying boxes of tissues.
</P>
<P>
   Among those making the trip was Tim Larson, 39, of East
Hartford, Conn., whose wife's uncle, Victor Rizza, 58, a Sicilian
chemistry professor, died in the crash with her cousin Antonino,
15. They were returning home after a five-week visit to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Looking out on the seascape, which is a popular subject on
picture postcards here, Larson suppressed a sob. ``This is such a
pretty place,'' he said, his voice cracking. ``You read about this
stuff and you see it, and it's never supposed to happen to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he prepared to go down to the water's edge. ``We're going
to say a prayer and just try to take it in,'' he said. ``It's just
something to hold onto.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early afternoon an elderly man collapsed on the rocky
jetty and was carried off on a stretcher and taken to a local
hospital. Officials said it was unclear whether he had slipped on
the rocks or suffered a seizure or heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   As the families struggled to come to terms with their loss,
Canadian officials stepped up their efforts to recover the bodies
of the victims and pieces of the plane.
</P>
<P>
   The fog, rain, and high seas that hampered the early search and
salvage efforts finally subsided Saturday, and although a brisk
north wind continued to blue, officials said they were hopeful that
search teams would make more progress as they scoured the seas.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, teams of police and military divers were
sent down at the crash site, about five miles off the coast of
Peggy's Cove.
</P>
<P>
   And two remote-controlled submersibles equipped with video
cameras were sent to the ocean floor, about 120 feet below the
surface, in several spots where sonar had detected what may be
pieces of the wrecked airplane.
</P>
<P>
   But, much to the frustration of investigators, the single most
important pieces of evidence that would help them piece together
the last moments of the flight _ the so-called black boxes
containing the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder
_ have yet to be found.
</P>
<P>
   The boxes are equipped with audio beacons, or ``pingers,'' that
emit signals for the purpose of helping searchers find them, but no
trace of them has been picked up by sonar or by a Canadian
submarine that combed the area for a second straight day.
</P>
<P>
   Without those pieces of evidence, investigators said, it would
be very difficult to learn what caused the jet, a McDonnell Douglas
MD-11 carrying 229 people from New York to Geneva, to crash into
the water as it tried to make an emergency landing here.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators from the Canadian Transportation Safety Board
continued to pore over the little evidence they had, studying the
transcripts of tape-recorded conversations between the pilot and
the control tower and scrutinizing radar tapes to chart the plane's
final, erratic movements before it went down into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 300 friends and family members who arrived here
Friday on specially chartered flights from New York and Switzerland
longed to learn what had caused the disaster, peppering Canadian
officials with questions at special briefings about the crash.
</P>
<P>
   But others said that it made little difference to them, that the
most important thing was that they had lost the people they loved
and must try to cope with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some people who are here, finding out the cause is the
burning issue for them,'' said Claire Mortimer, 45, whose father,
John Mortimer, a former senior vice president of The New York
Times, and stepmother, Hilda Mortimer, died in the crash. ``To me,
it doesn't make a lot of difference, because they're gone.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mortimer walked down to the cove holding two pink roses and
a stem of freesia.
</P>
<P>
   About five miles off shore, the crew of the Preserver, a
Canadian naval supply ship, directed a flotilla of more than 30
smaller boats as they picked up debris and body parts from a crash
site that was growing ever wider from wind and tides.
</P>
<P>
   Cpl. Frank Skidmore of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said
that the search area had grown to a 70-square-mile swath of ocean,
and that the Canadian authorities had placed the entire area off
limits to boats and planes for nearly 50 miles of coastline, from
Mahone Bay to the mouth of Halifax Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   On land, 250 Canadian soldiers and 300 volunteers fanned out to
scour the rocky coastline and cobbled beaches to gather the debris
and wreckage that washed ashore.
</P>
<P>
   They preserved everything: the blue sleeping mask with the
Swissair logo, a turtleneck sweater found peeping out from beneath
the sand and twisted pieces of metal and foam that were difficult
to place. It all went into clear plastic evidence bags.
</P>
<P>
   On board the Preserver, all the human remains that were
recovered were carefully labeled according to where they were found
and then flown off the ship by Sea King helicopters. The remains
were taken to a makeshift morgue that was set up in an airplane
hangar at a nearby air base, where a team of pathologists began
trying to identify them through dental records, X-rays and DNA
samples.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday the first identification was made. Dr. John Butt,
the chief medical examiner of Nova Scotia, said Friday that in
addition to trying to identify the victims, his team would see
whether the bodies yielded clues to what happened in the last
minutes before the crash. Butt said that investigators have asked
the pathologist to conduct toxicology tests, to try to determine
whether the victims inhaled smoke before they died.
</P>
<P>
   Butt said that a significant number of bags containing human
remains had been brought ashore in the past three days. But family
members were told the unsettling news that almost none of the
bodies that had been found were intact, making visual
identifications impossible in most cases.
</P>
<P>
   Many family members have been asked to give small blood samples
to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, who will use them to compare
DNA samples with the remains.
</P>
<P>
   It is the kind of operation that Nova Scotia has come to be
familiar with in the four centuries since the first shipwreck was
reported off the treacherous coasts.
</P>
<P>
   The most famous instance was in 1911 when the Titanic went down
700 miles east of here. The Cunard Liner Carpathia took the
survivors to New York; the dead were brought here.
</P>
<P>
   Don Flynn, whose family has run Cruikshank's Halifax Funeral
Home here for generations, said that he was called the night of the
crash and told to begin making preparations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be our biggest job since my grandfather handled the
Halifax explosion,'' he said, referring to the worst disaster in
Halifax history, when a munitions ship exploded in Halifax harbor
in 1917, killing more than 1,700 and leveling whole neighborhoods
here.
</P>
<P>
   Out at Peggy's Cove, Skidmore said that it was difficult to
watch the family members grieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're devastated by the tragedy, as anyone would be,'' he
said. ``Though they don't expect to find loved ones alive, they're
hopeful that we will at least find identifiable remains.''

MIXED MESSAGE IS PUT FORWARD IN HARLEM RALLY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ With a turnout far smaller than organizers had hoped,
and with police officers lining every block, Harlem served as host
Saturday to a black youth rally that galvanized some with its calls
for unity and alienated others with the anti-white, antisemitic
message of its chief organizer, Khallid Abdul Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
   Several thousand people flowed past the clusters of police
officers everywhere to convene at Malcolm X Boulevard and West
118th Street, where a large stage had been erected overnight. They
chanted ``Black Power,'' waved black nationalist flags and taunted
police officers for limiting pedestrian traffic on some streets
with shouts of ``These are our streets!''
</P>
<P>
   Within the first 30 minutes of speeches from the stage, the
crowds _ which appeared to be closer to 20,000 than the 50,000
organizers had predicted _ received the kind of mixed message that
has disturbed Harlem's political leaders and prompted Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani to denounce the rally, called the Million Youth March, as
a ``hate march.''
</P>
<P>
   First, a young boy identified as Little Brother Damien of the
Harlem Boys Choir urged understanding between generations of black
people: ``We've got to change the way we treat our mothers and
fathers and the ways our mothers and fathers treat their sons and
daughters.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy's plea received prolonged applause. Then another speaker
introduced Malik Zulu Shabazz, a lawyer and close aide to Muhammad,
as the man who ``gave Jews hell in the newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care that you call yourself Crip, I don't care that
you call yourself Blood,'' Shabazz said, referring to some of the
prominent gangs that had been invited to the rally. ``You are the
chosen people of God. I don't care what the Jews say. You are the
only people who have been in bondage for over 400 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Shabazz also ridiculed Giuliani, whose administration had tried
to thwart the event, and whose unpopularity among some in the crowd
was evident in a sign being waved near the stage. ``Waste Nazi
Giuliani,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   `` Giuliani,'' Shabazz said, ``you have no power over your
former slaves.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who spent the morning at the Latin-American Little
League World Series in Brooklyn, expressed only delight that as of
early Saturday afternoon, the rally was significantly smaller than
its organizers had hoped and appeared to be generally peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it shows me is that our strategy has worked,'' Giuliani
said. ``The `Million Person March' is going to be some
infinitesimal percentage of that `million person.' '' He went on,
``I think most kids in New York City _ white, black, Hispanic,
Asian, whatever the group _ they'd rather play baseball today than
march under the banner of a hater.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's event culminated a monthslong quarrel between
organizers and the city. The ostensible question centered on the
rights to the use of the streets of Harlem, but an undercurrent of
racial tension has flowed through the dispute. For the last several
weeks, the mayor has denounced the rally as a ``hate march'' while
Muhammad has demonstrated his ability to espouse anti-white
sentiments in the engaging cadences of a preacher.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Two city councilmen from Harlem, Stanley Michels and Guillermo
Linares, attended the rally and branded it a failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The turnout here today is clearly a rejection of what Khallid
Muhammad has said and the racism he stands for,'' Michels said.
Part of the reason the rally's organizers failed, he said, is that
they went around elected officials _ even to the point of insulting
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way it could have been a success even if they had
approached us,'' he said. ``The message they represent would have
still spelled failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Linares concurred. ``To the credit of this community, they
understand the difference between a positive message and racism,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But state Sen. David Paterson and other Harlem officials were
clearly more anxious about the possibility of a clash between the
police and the participants. Early Saturday morning they sent out
more than 500 volunteers _ some wearing shirts saying ``Harlem
Community Observer'' _ to act as mediators and to direct people who
needed help finding bathrooms and water.
</P>
<P>
   By early afternoon, Paterson was in his office on West 125th
Street, receiving reports from the field _ and he was not happy
about what he was hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're exhorting the crowd to violence, which is barbaric and
just inhuman,'' he said. ``There's a large gathering of young
people. Many of them feel intimidated and harassed by the full
deployment of police. Given that intimidation, for the speakers to
be advocating the shooting of white people is loathsome. And yet my
feeling is that this visible presence of police artillery has in
many senses provoked the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that the marchers have been caught between this
firestorm of force vs. inflammatory rhetoric. And I just pray that
the gathering will disperse peacefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those attending the rally were clearly angry about how
the police were handling things,
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the million cop march, not the million youth march,''
said Michael White, 36, who lives in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section
of Brooklyn. ``All the police are on the inside, we're all on the
outside. It shouldn't be like that.''
</P>
<P>
   LeShea Brown, 19, said police officers stopped her at 121st
Street and Fifth Avenue and said she would have to turn around
unless she could show that she lived in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to lie,'' she said. ``I had to cry and lie just to walk
through my own community. I pay taxes here. It's not fair for
Giuliani to treat us this way. You can't tell me that any of this
would happen if this were the St. Patrick's Day parade.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute between the city and the rally organizers began in
January, when organizers filed vague plans for a Million Youth
March, somewhere in the city, on Sept. 19. But as the months
passed, those vague plans evolved into a formal request for a
12-hour event on Sept. 5 _ the first day of the Labor Day weekend _
for 29 blocks stretching up Malcolm X Boulevard in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   The city denied the request, saying it would cause excessive
congestion at a time when the city's complement of police officers
was already stretched thin by vacations and other weekend events.
It suggested Sept. 19 as an alternative time, and Randalls Island
and Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx as alternative locations.
Shortly afterward, Muhammad suggested that he would hold the event
with or without a permit, and raised the possibility that gang
members who attend the event might, if provoked, resort to
violence.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, what had been a quiet debate between the city and
the organizers became public, surprising many in Harlem who had no
idea that their community was being considered as the site of a
large rally. The neighborhood's political leaders criticized
Muhammad for speaking of black unity while also failing to tell
Harlem of his plans. They said he had placed them in the awkward
position of supporting the empowerment of black youth _ the stated
purpose of the rally _ while decrying the leader's antisemitic,
anti-white message.
</P>
<P>
   But Harlem's leaders also complained that the mayor had not kept
them apprised, which they said reflected his poor relations with
the city's black community. And they said that by mixing the denial
of the permit with his denunciation of Muhammad as a hate-monger,
Giuliani had failed to recognize the complexities posed by the
situation, and had only aggravated tensions.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's standard response to this charge was that he could
not separate the message from the messenger, a point he shared
again on Friday. ``We're hopeful that most people will make the
point that they're against hatred and they will not separate the
leader from the march and therefore not join in the march and
therefore not march under the banner of anti-white, anti-Jewish,
anti-Catholic hatred, anti-anything-else hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   Late last month, the organizers filed a lawsuit in U.S. District
Court for the Southern District in Manhattan, arguing that the
city's denial of their permit had denied their constitutional
rights to free speech. A federal judge eventually agreed, and
suggested in his ruling that the city had the wherewithal to handle
the 12-hour, 29-block march.
</P>
<P>
   But last week a three-judge panel for the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals drastically reduced the scope of the planned rally,
saying that while the organizers have a constitutional right to
demonstrate, they do not have a right to dictate to the city the
terms of such a gathering. After a lawyer for the organizers
acknowledged that they expected only 50,000 people to attend _
rather than the 1 million to 3 million originally touted _ the
panel narrowed the rally to just four hours, and only six blocks.
</P>
<P>
   That decision left both the city and the organizers declaring
victory and promising to cooperate. But in the days leading to the
event, the organizers declined to reveal pertinent information
about the rally to anyone, including city officials, who complained
that misleading information about the event was still being
circulated on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery ended Friday morning, with the sight of the stage
looming over a corner of Malcolm X Boulevard that reflects the
struggles of the Harlem community. To the west of the stage were
two apartment buildings: one had blooming potted plants visible
from the windows; the other was mostly abandoned, with six stories
of boarded-up windows.
</P>
<P>
   Participants included hundreds of people who identified
themselves as members of various organizations: the Youth for
Social Change, from Durham, N.C.; the Workfare Workers; the Black
Latin Association of the Bronx. Its leader had a grenade strapped
to his shirt. He declined to say whether it was live.
</P>
<P>
   Jamille Jones, 17, of Newark, who had joined 50 other people in
taking the PATH train from New Jersey and then the A train to
Harlem, wore a black beret and pins depicting black panthers. He
spoke admiringly of Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't hold his tongue,'' the young man said. ``He tells
it like it is, about what they're doing to us. He's filling our
anger.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether he was bothered by Muhammad's antisemitic
rhetoric, Jones said:
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean, calling the Jews `bloodsuckers'? Well, maybe they
should analyze it, and think, `Why is he calling us bloodsuckers?'

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Eager to get down to what for him has historically
been the risky business of surviving the first week of the U.S.
Open, Goran Ivanisevic clocked in early enough at the National
Tennis Center before Saturday morning's straight-set dismissal of
Paul Haarhuis to check his mailbox.
</P>
<P>
   Inside it, the game's most erratic shotmaster found a most
unusual gift: an early birthday present from a female fan. His
admirer wanted him to have something different when he celebrated
his 27th birthday on Sept. 13, which also happens to be the date
that this 1998 Open will appoint its men's champion.
</P>
<P>
   Given a choice of birthday presents, Ivanisevic, who is not
quite resigned to sidekick status in the game's record books as the
best player never to win a Grand Slam tournament, would select the
men's title.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of the question I've been hearing for the last six
or seven years, always the same question, and always the same
stupid answer,'' the 14th-seeded Ivanisevic said after firing 21
aces in the 7-6 (7-5), 6-3, 6-4 victory that left him four rounds
short of collecting this Grand Slam event's highest honor. ``I know
I'm maybe the best player never to win a Grand Slam, but I'm
trying. There's a chance I can win this one.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ivanisevic said the odds of his proudly displaying the
Open's trophy back home for show-and-tell in Split, Croatia, were
much better than his flashing around the shiny new handcuffs that
drew a big crowd, including his next opponent, the Open's defending
champion, Patrick Rafter, when he unveiled them in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty weird stuff,'' Ivanisevic said about the first
pair of handcuffs he had ever seen, much less owned. ``In Croatia,
things like that you hide.''
</P>
<P>
   But invisible handcuffs like the ones that have clamped down and
prevented him from winning any of the three Wimbledon finales he
has reached, including this year's loss to Pete Sampras, have
wrought a kind of mental bondage Ivanisevic has been only too
familiar with.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough when I have to play against both me and the other
guy,'' Ivanisevic said of his history of self-destructive behavior
at Grand Slam events, particularly here at the Open, where he had
taken a first-round dive in three of his last four appearances.
``But lately I'm playing most of the time against the other guy,
not against myself.''
</P>
<P>
   After putting an end to a five-match losing streak against the
32-year-old Haarhuis, Ivanisevic contended that he is playing so
superbly at the Open that he intends to use serves, volleys and
passing shots to handcuff his pal Rafter in their Round of 16
clash. Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's maybe the best I've ever played at the U.S. Open,'' he
said of his form through three rounds, ``but it doesn't mean
anything. He's confident, I'm confident, but somebody has to win,
so it's going to be interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivanisevic defeated Rafter in the fourth round at Wimbledon in
1996 in their only previous meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty confident in my head,'' Ivanisevic said, ``but
sometimes I get a little bit messed up there. I have to bang it,
then everything comes together.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafter, after receiving a fright when he opened his title
defense of his first Grand Slam crown by scrambling out of a
five-set trap laid by Hicham Arazi, has conscientiously cruised
through the subsequent rounds in straight sets.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's 66-minute demolition of David Nainkin, the
188th-ranked qualifier who knocked out Gustavo Kuerten, the 1997
French Open champion, was representative of Rafter's Open game
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never feel badly about winning,'' the third-seeded Rafter
said. ``You want to get on and get off the court as quick as you
possibly can, conserve your energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafter did just that in Saturday's 6-1, 6-1, 6-1 victory, his
quickest ever at a Grand Slam event, which moved him into the Round
of 16 opposite Ivanisevic.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After sharing a laugh at Ivanisevic's mailbox before their
respective third-round victories, Rafter promised that he and the
iconoclastic Croat would be all business in the fourth round.
``When we get on, there will be no love lost,'' Rafter said.
``We'll be doing our business, and when we get off, we'll be good
mates. He's crazy, likes to have fun, and that sort of suits in
well with my personality.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Rafter, Ivanisevic wasn't kidding when he predicted
that this Grand Slam tournament could be the one where he finally
breaks through the barrier that has kept him from capturing a major
championship. ``He's knuckled down this year,'' Rafter said, ``he's
got his mind on the job in the last three or four months.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafter has done much the same thing this summer after an
indifferent start to the 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a dangerous man,'' Rafter added about Ivanisevic. ``He
can do anything and nothing on a given day; when he's on, he's on.
There's not too many better players running around than Goran when
he's on.''
</P>
<P>
   MATCH POINTS
</P>
<P>
   Fifth-seeded Venus Williams, last year's runner-up, defeated
Larisa Neiland, after the 32-year-old Latvian retired from their
match after just five games. The 85th-ranked Neiland has been
bothered by chronic back trouble, and it flared up Saturday just 13
minutes into the match.

 AT HOME: SHELTER FROM THE STORM 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ First, the good news: The 1998 hurricane season is
nearly half over.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the not-so-good news: We still have the worst half to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hurricane season begins on June 1 and lasts until Nov.
30,'' said Shelly Auster, a spokeswoman for the American Red Cross
of Greater New York. ``But the peak of the season is traditionally
September.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ms. Auster said, while the southern coastal states
typically get the brunt of most Atlantic hurricanes, residents of
the New York City area are not immune from risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to live way out on Long Island to be affected
by a storm,'' she said. ``There are many areas of the city that
experience flooding from relatively small amounts of rain. And even
tropical storms have winds that are strong enough to break windows,
topple trees and knock down power lines.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Ms. Auster said, because it is relatively rare for the
New York City area to be hit with the full force of a major
hurricane, people who live here frequently fail to take the
precautions necessary to withstand such a storm when one finally
hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``In communities where hurricanes are common, people prepare in
advance for the worst,'' she said. ``Here, though, people usually
end up trying to prepare at the last minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners in areas of high risk for hurricanes, for example,
often have storm shutters installed on their homes to protect
windows from high winds and flying debris. And while suburban
residents are hardly likely to retrofit their homes with functional
shutters, it might be worth the time and effort, particularly if
the home is near the water, to precut sheets of plywood to fit over
windows and patio doors, in particular.
</P>
<P>
   ``A dead tree branch can become an airborne dagger in high
winds,'' Ms. Auster said, adding that if a storm is expected, it is
also critical to take into the house or garage anything that might
turn into a flying object in high winds. That includes lawn
furniture, toys, loose pieces of wood, lightweight tables and
chairs and patio umbrellas. For homeowners with double-width doors
on two-car garages, she said, it is prudent to precut wood beams to
act as a brace for the door to keep it from buckling in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Yagerman, a spokeswoman for the Federal Emergency
Management Agency in Washington, said that homeowners with garages
should make sure to put their cars inside them, particularly in
suburban areas with lots of big, old trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was living in Salem, Massachusetts, I watched a
windstorm knock over a huge tree onto two cars parked in a
neighbor's driveway right in front of an empty garage,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Ms. Yagerman said, homeowners with double-door
front entrances should install heavy-duty bolts at the top and
bottom of the stationary door to keep it from flying open in a
storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bolts or pins on most doors are not strong enough,'' Ms.
Yagerman said, adding that high-strength bolts cost $10 to $40 and
can usually be installed by the homeowner.
</P>
<P>
   In areas that are susceptible to flooding, particularly near the
coast, Ms. Yagerman said added precautions are needed when a
hurricane is predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen flooding move houses off their foundations,'' she
said, pointing out that any house that has had even minor flooding
in the past is a good candidate for more serious flooding during a
serious hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important not to leave valuable things on lower floors,''
Ms. Yagerman said. ``And if local officials tell you to evacuate
the area, take your important papers and easy-to-carry valuables
with you.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another precaution, she said, is to remove all chemicals and
cleaning products from storage areas in basements and in
first-floor kitchens and bathrooms, to prevent the chemicals from
getting into standing water and injuring residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can get very sick from walking around in chemicals
mixed in standing water in their own basements,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Yagerman also said that people with pets should call their
local branch of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals for information on how to find housing for their pets if
it appears that the home will have to be evacuated in a storm. Most
temporary shelters for evacuees do not allow pets, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Mackoul, president of Mackoul &AMP; Associates, an insurance
brokerage company in Lynbrook, said that one thing that every
homeowner should do _ whether or not a storm is imminent or they
have flood insurance _ is to make a room-by-room documentary
videotape of everything in the home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm talking about jewelry, fine arts, paintings, rugs,
everything,'' Mackoul said. ``If you have all that stuff on tape,
and you have a running commentary about what it is and what it's
worth, you're going to have a baseline for what's in your house in
the event you someday have to file a claim.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who remain inside their homes during a storm, experts say,
should follow some basic survival rules like stocking up on
provisions _ water, canned food, a manual can opener and batteries
for flashlights and radios _ and should stay away from windows and
doors.
</P>
<P>
   Marian Perkowski, a spokeswoman for the Lightning Protection
Institute, a trade organization of protection contractors in
Arlington Heights, Ill., added that during a severe storm
accompanied by lightning, it is wise to unplug all sensitive
electrical appliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you have a lightning protection system in the house, or
a master surge protector where the electrical service originates,
it's best to unplug the computer, the television and the stereo,''
Ms. Perkowski said. ``Lightning can strike a power line a quarter
of a mile away from your house and still fry your equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, she said, it is wise to stay off the telephone during
a lightning storm _ lightning has been known to travel through
telephone lines _ and to avoid touching other electrical
appliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some parents let their kids play video games during a storm,''
Ms. Perkowski said. ``But that's sure not something I would be
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she said, though it might seem a remote possibility to
be injured by a storm while inside the home, such injuries do
occur. And when they do, there is generally one common denominator,
Ms. Perkowski said: ``Nobody believes something like that could
possibly happen to them _ until it happens.''

<P>
   With the kickoff of the NFL season on Sunday, CoxNet will begin
posting The Journal-Constitution's two weekly NFL pages _ a preview
page and an Inside the NFL page _ every Saturday beginning this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The preview page will feature a standings box and a capsule
preview of the games on Sunday and the Monday night game. It will
be posted by 2 p.m. EDT each Saturday during the regular season and
is for use that Sunday. The format for this year's page will
include the equivalent of one column in ads. The AJC has asked for
the ad stack to be a strip across the bottom of the page each week,
but there is no guarantee that the ad stack will be in that
position or will be the same from week-to-week. If the capsules and
standings box are ready on Friday night, CoxNet will post the page
then without a story. This early posting will allow papers that are
using it to pull it into their systems as early as possible. In
this case, other Cox papers would have the option of waiting for
the story to move on the Sports wire or of filling the text hole
with another story, such as one about a team in their circulation
area.
</P>
<P>
   The Inside the NFL page will look much the same as the AJC's
Inside Baseball and Inside the NBA pages with conference briefs on
the outside rails and league feature stories in the middle four
columns. This page will be posted on the Cox server by 3 p.m. EDT
each Saturday during the regular season and is also for use that
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   If you have any questions, please call the CoxNet desk in
Atlanta at 404 526-5456.

EDITORIAL: DUMPING BY THE COAST GUARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, Sept. 6:
</P>
<P>
   Until the raising of the nation's environmental consciousness in
the 1970s, many Americans treated their bays, rivers and streams as
little more than open sewers into which trash, sewage and
industrial waste could be cheaply and quickly dumped. Even so, it
comes as something of a shock to be reminded that among the vandals
was the official guardian of the nation's navigable waterways _ the
U.S. Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 50 years, by its own admission, the Coast Guard
dumped as many as 100,000 batteries containing toxic materials like
mercury into waterways throughout the country, including the Hudson
River. The batteries were used to illuminate stationary towers,
buoys and other navigational markers. When the time came to replace
them, the old batteries were simply pitched into the water instead
of being taken to shore for safe disposal.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard says it stopped the dumping in the 1970s, after
Congress passed the Clean Water Act and other environmental laws.
But the agency did not begin a cleanup program until 1995, and to
many fishermen and environmentalists, it has done a mediocre job.
Last week, 25 angling associations and conservation groups notified
the Coast Guard of their intention to file suit in federal court.
Their aim is to force the agency to make public its cleanup
strategy and finish the task.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard says it is mystified. It concedes the stupidity
of its past dumping practices, but says that since 1995 its divers
have recovered 39,000 batteries at nearly 9,000 sites at a cost of
$10 million, with 4,000 more sites to go. The plaintiffs, however,
contend that the agency has focused on fixed sites _ stationary
platforms built in shallower waters _ where the batteries are
easier to find, leaving unexplored thousands of batteries from
buoys anchored in deeper waters.
</P>
<P>
   Under law, the Environmental Protection Agency is required to
keep an eye on the Coast Guard's cleanup efforts. But the relevant
environmental statutes also allow for citizen oversight, and so far
there has been very little. The cleanup effort can only profit from
a full public airing.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Deputy Chief Emil A. Ciccotelli, a longtime New York
police commander who was an expert on organized crime and oversaw
investigations of some sensational killings, died last Sunday at
Our Lady of Mercy Hospital in the Bronx. He was 69.
</P>
<P>
   The cause apparently was a heart attack, said Richard Ruggiero,
the manager of the F. Ruggiero and Sons funeral home in Yonkers.
Ruggiero is a friend of the family.

   Ciccotelli (pronounced chick-oh-TELL-ee) retired in 1992 after
38 years in the Police Department. ``He had a reputation as a very
strong commander,'' said Tom Reppetto, the president of the
Citizens Crime Commission, ``and he was given a lot of responsible
assignments in the department.''
</P>
<P>
   After retirement, Ciccotelli taught criminal justice at Iona
College in New Rochelle. He spent more than a decade, as an
inspector and then a deputy chief, overseeing investigations, first
by the Organized Crime Control Bureau, then as commander of Bronx
detectives and later as commander of Brooklyn detectives. The
Brooklyn assignment was his last before he retired.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, when he was with the Organized Crime Control Bureau, he
was among the witnesses, along with Rudolph Giuliani, the U.S.
attorney in Manhattan _ and now the city's mayor _ who testified
about organized crime at a special hearing of the U.S. Senate
Judiciary Committee. The hearing focused on organized crime in New
York City, and particularly on narcotics traffic.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing, Ciccotelli led a team of other New York Police
Department experts who outlined the structure, leadership and
activities of the city's five major crime families.
</P>
<P>
   He also spoke of other organized groups, including Colombian
cocaine traffickers, and he told the committee that the time had
come for ``a major, cooperative offensive'' by law enforcement
against organized crime. At the hearing Giuliani said, ``If we
could now redouble our efforts, we could end La Cosa Nostra within
this generation.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last 15 years, most authorities say, the influence and
power of the five Mafia families in New York City have indeed been
reduced, especially in the construction industry and the
garbage-carting industry, and at the Fulton Fish Market.
</P>
<P>
   The amount and quality of resources used in the fight against
crime were a perennial concern of Ciccotelli. In 1982, while with
the Organized Crime Control Bureau, he told how important
confidential informers had become.
</P>
<P>
   He said in an interview that they were most frequently used in
cases involving organized crime, especially narcotics, and he said
that informers in that kind of case could be the most expensive. In
one case, the police promised to give an informer ``payments not to
exceed $5,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the investigations of killings that the chief supervised
as commander of detectives in the Bronx (1984-87) and Brooklyn
(1990-92) was the fatal shooting of five people in a Flatbush
apartment, including Michael Johnson, who the police said was a
drug dealer. Another case was the slaying of a 15-year-old girl,
Zipora Yagodajev, under the Williamsburg Bridge.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ciccotelli was born in Manhattan and received a bachelor's
degree from Iona College in 1975. He was an adjunct professor of
criminal justice at Iona from 1992 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 48 years, the former Lorraine
Reeber; six sons, Michael, Emil Jr., James and Peter, all of the
Bronx, Thomas of Pelham, and Richard of Yonkers; a daughter,
Jeanmarie Dool of Flemington, N.J.; 15 grandchildren; and two
brothers, Anthony and Nunzio, both of the Bronx.

EDITORIAL: THE PRIMARIES IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, Aug. 6:
</P>
<P>
   For years, The New York Times has generally refrained from
primary endorsements in major elections. We are altering that
practice this year and anticipate doing so in the future. Primaries
now often present the most critical and complicated choices that
voters face in a campaign year. We feel readers have a right to see
how we analyze these contests and which candidates we recommend.
</P>
<P>
   Taking sides in political primaries poses some delicate problems
for an editorial page. A primary endorsement might be interpreted
as committing us to that candidate for the general election. That
is emphatically not the case. Our support will not necessarily
translate into a fall endorsement, nor will it preclude backing
another candidate from the same party should our first preference
lose the primary.
</P>
<P>
   As always with The Times, the recommendations of this page will
have nothing to do with news coverage of the campaign, since the
news department and the editorial page are independent of each
other.
</P>
<P>
   This paper regularly endorses in primaries for local races in
districts where one-sided party registration makes the nomination
tantamount to election. But in state and national contests, we have
normally deferred making a judgment until the nominations were set.
</P>
<P>
   One exception occurred in 1952, when this page advised New
Hampshire Republicans to vote for Dwight Eisenhower in the
Republican primary. Forty years later, we backed Bill Clinton for
the presidential primary in New York, and although President George
Bush was unopposed in the state, we told readers he deserved
renomination. In 1976, The Times picked Daniel Patrick Moynihan in
the Democratic Senate primary.
</P>
<P>
   Those were exceptions to the rule. But these days, primaries
have evolved far from their old status as internal party matters.
They often involve a number of candidates whose names are not
familiar to the public and whose policy differences are narrow or
murky. The primary is now the point in the election process when
voters are most hungry for insight, so from now on we will offer an
opinion whenever it seems appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   It seems appropriate to initiate a new endorsement practice with
an enthusiastic recommendation. Happily, the Democratic race for
the U.S. Senate nomination gives us that opportunity. In a contest
that features three strong candidates, Rep. Charles Schumer of
Brooklyn is our preference. As noted above, this endorsement
applies only to the Democratic primary. In November the primary
winner will face Sen. Alfonse D'Amato in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer and his primary opponents, Geraldine Ferraro and New
York City Public Advocate Mark Green, all have the capacity to
serve the state well in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro, as the whole nation knows, ran as the Democratic
nominee for vice president in 1984. Since then she has been active
as a lawyer, public speaker and ambassador to the U.N. Human Rights
Commission. While she has sometimes seemed to have trouble charging
up this campaign, Ferraro has an appealing, down-to-earth speaking
style and a star quality that could make her a formidable
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Green has an impressive record as a city official, particularly
in his fights against the tobacco lobby and mob influence in the
carting industry. He has run an aggressive but fair campaign, and
if he fails to win, he will undoubtedly still have an important
political future in the city.
</P>
<P>
   What places Schumer at the head of this distinguished list is
his record in the House of Representatives. Over the last 18 years
he has grown from an ambitious young politician known for his
eagerness to get his name in the papers to a serious legislator
with drive, determination and the ability to turn his ideas into
national law.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer is best known for his work as the top congressional
proponent of gun control, the sponsor and driving force behind
passage of the landmark Brady bill. He also is the chief
congressional architect of the clinic access bill, protecting
women's right to choice. He has a real zest for the legislative
process, from the nuts and bolts of committee work to floor debate.
He is a tireless campaigner and is diligent in his constituent
services.
</P>
<P>
   A career politician in the best sense, Schumer has held elective
office since he graduated from law school and ran for the state
Assembly in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of resume has not always been popular with voters, and
for good reason. After a decade or more as legislators, most men
and women tend to settle into a groove of affable accommodation or
cynical crankiness. But occasionally lawmakers come along with
enormous energy and the peculiar gifts necessary to become masters
of the legislative process. Schumer has that gift. He is very good
at using it, and he continues to get better.

TANIA LONG, 85, WAR CORRESPONDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., N.Y., Canada, Great Britain)  (mk) 
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tania Long, a pioneering female war correspondent for The New
York Herald Tribune and The New York Times who covered the London
blitz and the Nuremburg trials, died Friday morning at her home in
Ottawa. She was 85.
</P>
<P>
   After suffering from a series of illnesses, Ms. Long committed
suicide, said Dr. Guy Genier, a coroner in Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a woman of strong character, strong principles,
dedicated to her work,'' said Joan Gordon, a friend of Ms. Long in
Ottawa. ``Her life had become painful to her because of illness.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Berlin on April 29, 1913, Ms. Long was the daughter of
the Russian-born Tatiana Mouraviev and Robert Crozier Long, a
British journalist. Educated in Germany, France and England, Ms.
Long studied economics, Russian literature and European history at
the Sorbonne in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   She became an American citizen in 1935 and began her
journalistic career a year later as a reporter for The Newark
Ledger in New Jersey. She returned to Berlin in 1938 to work for
The New York Herald Tribune and joined The Tribune's London bureau
in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   In London, she wrote of the city's poor during the blitz and of
the bombing of the Hotel Savoy while she was living there. ``I was
sitting in my third-floor room ready to get into bed when I heard
the bombs coming,'' she wrote. ``Only a split second later the next
bomb hit the cornice of the hotel and went off, and almost
immediately after that the other one hit the rear of the building.
When one hears bombs coming that close, there is not time to do
anything. One hasn't time to be afraid; that comes later.''
</P>
<P>
   During the war, Ms. Long married Raymond Daniell, the London
bureau chief for The New York Times, and she joined The Times as a
reporter in February 1942. When Allied troops invaded Europe, Ms.
Long, who continued to write under her maiden name, followed their
advance, writing stories from liberated towns in France. She
followed the Allied troops in Berlin, apparently the first female
correspondent to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Long and Daniell became a prominent husband-wife
journalistic team, covering the Nuremberg trials and postwar
Germany. Ms. Long spoke the languages of all four occupying powers
_ English, French and Russian _ as well as German.
</P>
<P>
   From 1952 until 1964, she and her husband ran The Times' bureau
in Ottawa, where they became prominent figures in the country's
political and journalistic circles. Honored upon their departure
with a gala attended by the Canadian prime minister, the couple
were hailed in The Ottawa Journal. They returned to Ottawa upon
Daniell's retirement from The Times in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Long's 1932 marriage to Merwin Mallory Gray in Paris ended
in divorce six years later. A son from that marriage, Robert Gray,
died of cancer, said Sarah Jennings, a Canadian arts journalist and
a family friend. Daniell also died of cancer, in 1969. In the
1970s, Ms. Long became the first publicist for the National Arts
Center of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was one of the breed of women that came out of the wartime
era,'' said Ms. Jennings, ``most of whom were happily married and
supportive of their husbands but in and of themselves were very
strong-willed and independent.''

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: JAPAN'S VERY TIMID PRESCRIPTION FOR CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By STEVEN R. WEISMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The frantic U.S. efforts to get Japan to act boldly to cure its
financial crisis remind me of the time my mother got sick in Japan
and was rushed to the hospital, where the Japanese doctors' best
attempts to reassure her went awry.
</P>
<P>
   As the doctors called for a battery of sophisticated tests, my
mother mistakenly assumed they were following the U.S. practice of
testing only when something worrisome is suspected. Visibly
anxious, she asked what was wrong. The doctors thought she was
doubting their thoroughness, so they ordered even more tests. The
more the doctors tried to reassure my mother, the worse she felt.
</P>
<P>
   The same wide cultural gap afflicts the anguished dialogue
between U.S. and Japanese financial officials. The United States is
demanding root canal surgery on Japanese banks as the best way to
instill confidence in the system. The more banks shut down, the
more bad loans disclosed and written off, the better. Japan
counters that these steps will lead to panic, bank withdrawals and
declining confidence in the nation's economic future _ the opposite
of what is intended.
</P>
<P>
   Washington and Wall Street worry that Japan's anemic financial
policies are likely to keep its economy moribund and prevent
recovery throughout Asia, possibly leading to a financial collapse
that will make the recent turmoil in world markets look like a
warm-up. Indeed, as Kenneth Courtis of Deutsche Bank has noted,
Japan is more internationally isolated today than at any time since
the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's problems are summed up in the career of Kiichi Miyazawa,
the 78-year-old former prime minister brought in by the new prime
minister, Keizo Obuchi, to oversee the economy. Sharp, charming and
unflappable _ as anyone who watched him cradle a sick President
George Bush in his arms in 1991 will long remember _ Miyazawa began
his career as a young Finance Ministry bureaucrat after the war who
resented being lectured by Gen. Douglas MacArthur. In his memoirs
he wrote that ``it may be hard for young people today to understand
how unpleasant it was to live under the occupation.''
</P>
<P>
   Any such person is unlikely to listen to American lectures, even
during a crisis. But because Miyazawa is considered a giant who
helped nurture the Japanese postwar miracle of state-supported
capitalism, with all its coziness and impenetrability, he is
especially unlikely to walk away today from a system that he feels
brought Japan back from the rubble and defeat of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   People who know him say he embraces the ``soft landing'' school
of Japanese finance, in that he feels a little more stimulus, and a
little more openness in its banking system, will pull Japan out of
its slump without causing undue panic.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, according to U.S. officials, is that the most
recent Japanese program is barely enough to reverse the negative
effects of Japan's ill-timed tax hike last year. Moreover, Japanese
officials are still debating the criteria for auditing the nation's
ailing banks, a bit late considering that this is the seventh year
of the Japanese slump. Tokyo has acknowledged bad debts of $550
billion, but U.S. officials and private experts say they actually
approach $1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese inaction goes beyond the cultural to the political.
Those in power in Japan have a strong vested interest in the status
quo. The all-powerful Finance Ministry has no desire to shed
control over the economy. Like Miyazawa, Finance Ministry alumni
who have gone on to wield power in business and politics tend
instinctively to look out for the ministry's interests.
</P>
<P>
   Miyazawa superintends these interests at the Liberal Democratic
Party, which has dominated Japan for nearly all of the last 45
years. Like the old saying about the Holy Roman Empire being
neither holy nor Roman nor an empire, the ruling party is not
liberal or democratic.
</P>
<P>
   It is less a party than a collection of special interests, from
farmers to small businesses, giant corporations and organized
crime, who supply money and resources to the party in return for
its protection. That circle of self-interest serves as a powerful
shield against demands for change.
</P>
<P>
   Add to all these factors the traditional Japanese belief in the
importance of consensus, and it is easy to see why radical reform
is difficult. I have seen schoolchildren spending so much time
trying to choose sides fairly for a baseball game that there is no
time left for the game.
</P>
<P>
   The world economy, of course, is not a game right now. But if
Russia is a one-time superpower flailing about for solutions, the
Japanese spectacle is one of deep-rooted inertia in the face of
genuine crisis.

 &HT;    CLINTON ENDS 'FEEL GOOD' TOUR OF IRELAND, RETURNING TO BAD
FEELINGS AT HOME
 &HT;    (EDs: Optional add after 700 words.)
 &HT;    With IRELAND-DELL-0906.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMERICK, Ireland _ A cold rain from the Atlantic paused just
long enough Saturday to provide President Bill Clinton one final
taste of Irish sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   In the center of this ancient city, Clinton took the stage to a
flurry of American and Irish flags and more of the welcoming cheers
that have greeted him at every stop on this storied island. An
estimated 20,000 people filled the narrow streets lined with pubs
and shops that lead into Connell Street.
</P>
<P>
   When the president rose to speak on a temporary stage, someone
in the crowd shouted, ``Welcome Mr. Clinton,'' to which the
president replied happily, ``I feel welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   The presidential visit provided a welcome spark for the peace
process, which had seemed stalled. A series of important
breakthroughs occurred before and during the trip, with the biggest
coming Saturday before Clinton's departure. David Trimble, the
leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, agreed to meet for the first
time with Gerry Adams, the head of Sinn Fein, the political wing of
the Irish Republican Army (IRA).
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, which would be symbolically potent, could take
place as early as Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had urged direct discussions on Thursday when he was in
Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another positive development,'' said White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   His white shirt gleaming in the late morning sun, the president
bid his farewell to the Irish people, praising them for finding the
road to peace and urging them not to lose their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the leaders in the world, all the speeches in the world
would not amount to a hill of beans if you hadn't gone out and
voted 'yes,' and meant it with every fiber of your being,'' Clinton
said, referring to the Good Friday peace accord and its subsequent
overwhelming support in referendums held in the Irish Republic and
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demons of the past are losing their power to divide you,
and a new and better and more prosperous history is unfolding for
you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also mourned the 29th victim of the Omagh bombing. Sean
McGrath, a 61-year-old baker, died from his wounds Saturday. The
father of four grown children had made the mistake of going to
Omagh's Market Street for a haircut on Aug. 15 and was cut down in
the explosion of a 500-pound car bomb. Thirty victims remain in
hospitals, three of whom are in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton admonished the crowd not to let such acts break their
will for peace. ``Don't do it, Don't do it,'' he said. ``Remember
what it was like when you were here on this day. This is you at
your best. Do not let them break your will.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Clinton's problems at home regarding his ``inappropriate
relationship'' with a former White House intern and what is likely
to be an unpleasant return, he remains very popular here -- perhaps
even more popular because of his difficult circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Laffey, a 62-year-old railroad worker, waited more than an
hour behind a metal barricade in the rain just to get a peek at the
president as his black Cadillac whisked by Henry Street. ``I've
come because I want to see him, because of who he is, one of the
greatest presidents in America's history,'' Laffey said. ``Look
what he's done for Ireland. Look what he's done for America, and
he's going to be forced out over what? That thing with that girl?
There but by the grace of God goes just about everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone was so quick to forgive. ``He's a liar,'' said
Sheila Quilligan, a 28-year-old retail manager standing a few feet
from Laffey. ``He lied to the American people in January and he's
been lying since. I don't hold with liars.''
</P>
<P>
   Quilligan came only at the insistence of her boyfriend, Philip
Ryan, who said too much was being made of Clinton's relationship
with Monica Lewinsky and its messy aftermath. ``Why can't everyone
just let it alone,'' Ryan said. ``It's a private affair.''
</P>
<P>
   First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton was also welcomed warmly
wherever she went, with each move and expression subjected to
analysis. The Clintons were far from cuddly during the trip, but
there was no obvious sign of of hostility. The first lady bought
the president a bright green Irish wool sweater, which he wore on
Air Force One. She also whispered in his ear on a number of
occasions; they often smiled at each other and he guided her up the
steps to the plane by gently holding her arm.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The president's problems even translated to a business boon for
a shop owner in Ballybunion, the town near the fabled golf course
where Clinton played in the afternoon before heading back to
Washington. The shop, ``Monica's Hair Styles'' was renamed ``The
President's Shop'' for the trip and did a brisk business in
commemorative coffee mugs and T-shirts. Catherine Fitzgerald, the
shop's owner, denied rumors that she'd been paid to make the
change.
</P>
<P>
   In Limerick, Clinton was granted an honorary citizenship, the
``Freedom of the City'' award given 35 years ago to President John
F. Kennedy. Clinton referred to his childhood hero, saying that
Kennedy pledged then to return to Limerick but was assassinated in
Dallas a few months later.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not able to fulfill that promise, but I appreciate the
opportunity to renew it, and to thank you for the springtime of
hope the Irish people have given the entire world in 1998,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of his speech, Clinton reached over a metal barricade
to shake the hands of people who were pressed against the stage.
Secret Service agents held on by his belt. Some women appeared to
be try to kiss him, others just reached up to touch him.
</P>
<P>
   As he finished a relaxed 18-hole round of golf, Clinton took his
time leaving the course, stopping for photos, chatting easily with
people outside the clubhouse and signing autographs. With a
borrowed pen -- and looking very much the celebrity -- he scribbled
his name on golf caps, scorecards, gloves, whatever was handed to
him.
</P>
<P>
   As the sun set over the Atlantic to the west, the direction Air
Force One was poised to return, it seemed as if Clinton, who is not
expected to return here as president, wanted to savor every minute.

   SUNDAY MARKETS PACKAGE
</P>
<P>
   The AJC is offering a package for this Sunday examining whether
the stock market volatility has altered consumer behavior, as well
as the plans of businesses that are directly affected by the whims
of consumers. Early reporting indicates that consumer confidence is
eroding, but other forces are probably more important than concerns
about the market. There's no doubt, however, that the market news
will reinforce some negative trends that were already at work. A
CoxNet repackaged page has been created and posted on the Cox

   IRELAND-CLINTON _ LIMERICK, Ireland _ The sun shone for
President Clinton once more Saturday as he prepared to tke his
leave of the warmth of Ireland and return to an uncertain future at
home. A crowd of 20,000 to 30,000 waving American flags braved cold
rains for more than an hour waiting for the president to make an
appearance at a rallyin the city center. Just minutes
beforeClinton's arrival, the clouds parted to show a blue sky. It
is easy to wonder when again will Clinton find himself standing
before such an adoring crown. A wrapup. (Roughton, Cox News

   PRISONER-BERENSON _ MIAMI _ ``President Clinton visited with
Monica Lewinsky on 37 occasions, but he can't see us once,'' said
Mark Berenson, his voice trembling with anger. For the last two and
a half years, the New Yorker and his wife, Rhoda Berenson, have
worked to free their daughter, Lori Berenson, from a windowless
prison some 500 miles outside Lima, Peru, where she's serving a
life sentence for treason. The 28-year-old MIT graduate was
convicted in 1996 of plotting to take over Peru's Congress by
hooded judges during a secret trial. The Berensons have tried
repeatedly to see Clinton, who has asked Peruvian President Alberto
Fujimori to review their daughter's case. I will visit in New York
with the couple, who will be just back from a visit with their
daughter at the prison, located 12,700 feet above sea level. I will
also visit with other members of Lori Berenson's family, who live
in Palm Beach, Florida. Story will focus on the family's plight to
win their daughter's freedom, and where Lori Berenson's case stands
now. (Emling, Cox News Service).

 LATE FLAG HELPS VOLS OVERCOME McNABB  
(lb) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. _ They don't do things the easy way here at
Syracuse. Right out of the gate, coach Paul Pasqualoni wanted to
see just what he had. No messing around. So he invited Tennessee,
which is ranked 10th in the country, to the Carrier Dome to test
his Orangemen, who are ranked 17th, in the season opener.
</P>
<P>
   If Pasqualoni was looking for resiliency and toughness from his
team, he found it. Unfortunately, he had no remedy for fate and an
official's flag late in the game. Benefiting from a late defensive
pass interference call, Tennessee marched down the field in the
last 1 minute 43 seconds, and Jeff Hall kicked a 27-yard field goal
that gave the Volunteers a 34-33 victory over Syracuse before a
raucous crowd of 49,550.
</P>
<P>
   The kick ended a wild back-and-forth game that saw four lead
changes in the fourth quarter. It also spoiled an otherwise
terrific game for quarterback Donovan McNabb, who helped Syracuse
overcome an 11-point third-quarter deficit and score 20 points in
the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   McNabb, a Heisman Trophy candidate, did nothing to hinder his
chances. He completed 21 of 27 passes for 298 yards and two
touchdowns, and he rushed for a touchdown. The Volunteers got a
magnificent performance from the sophomore running back Jamal
Lewis, who rushed for 141 yards and one touchdown on 20 carries.
</P>
<P>
   Things do not get any easier this week, because the Orangemen
travel to Ann Arbor to play the University of Michigan. But they
have a great game to build on.
</P>
<P>
   It looked as if Syracuse might have a victory after a pass by
Tennessee's new quarterback, Tamaurice ``Tee'' Martin, to receiver
Cedrick Wilson on fourth-and-7 at the Vols' 35-yard line fell
incomplete. But the officials called pass interference on
cornerback Will Allen, who was making his first start.
</P>
<P>
   Allen came over the back of Wilson, and two officials waved it
an incomplete pass, but the back judge threw his flag. That gave
the Vols a fresh set of downs at the Syracuse 46, and after they
moved down the field, Hall kicked his game-winner with four seconds
left.
</P>
<P>
   ``The right call,'' Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer said of the
pass interference.
</P>
<P>
   Said George DeLeone, Syracuse's defensive coordinator: ``I'm not
going to say it was a bad call. I just question why the guy right
on the play calls it an incomplete pass and the guy comes running
in from behind with a late flag.''
</P>
<P>
   The call overshadowed a fantastic fourth quarter in which the
teams dueled on offense and swapped leads as if they were trading
baseball cards. Martin, replacing Peyton Manning, completed just
nine of 26 passes for 143 yards, but he threw two for touchdowns
and finished with 80 yards rushing on nine carries. Martin
benefited greatly from the presence of Lewis, who rushed for 1,364
yards last year as a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   The first time he touched the ball Saturday afternoon, Lewis
ripped through the Syracuse defense for 30 yards. Martin completed
a 32-yard pass to receiver Jermaine Copeland that moved his team
from the 50 to the Syracuse 16. A couple of plays later, he rolled
out to his right and hit receiver Peerless Price in the flat on a
12-yard touchdown pass. The Vols were up by 7-0 and looked
unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   But the Orangemen clamped down after that drive and made
Tennessee earn everything it got in the first half. Syracuse, which
trailed by 14-10 at the half, pulled to within 14-13 early in the
third quarter, but Tennessee put its offense into gear and scored
10 consecutive points on a 1-yard touchdown run by Lewis and a
17-yard field goal by Hall that gave them a 24-13 lead with 3:15
left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But the Orangemen would not go away. They scored 14 points _ on
a 17-yard pass from McNabb to receiver Kevin Johnson and a 7-yard
run by McNabb, plus a 2-point conversion run by Ian McIntosh _ in
under three minutes to take their first lead, 27-24.
</P>
<P>
   But Tennessee came back on a 55-yard run by Martin and a penalty
for a late hit out of bounds following the run. That set up an
8-yard touchdown pass from Martin to Price on a third-and-5 at the
8, which helped give Tennessee a 31-27 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse pulled within 31-30 with 6:39 to play on a 41-yard
field goal by Nate Trout that was set up by a 75-yard kickoff
return by McIntosh. Trout added a 19-yard field goal at 2:38 to
give the Orangemen a 33-31 lead, setting up the wild finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this showed that we can go toe-to-toe with a big-time
program,'' DeLeone said. ``Now we can go to Michigan and see what
we can do there.''

CLINTON ENDS FOREIGN TOUR DOMINATED BY DOMESTIC ISSUES

</P>
<P>
   LIMERICK, Ireland _ Even as President Clinton stood in the glow
of a shining foreign policy success the shadow of scandal crept
across the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Irish filled this industrial city's streets
Saturday to glimpse Clinton, cheered for his role in the Good
Friday peace accord, as the morning Limerick papers trumpeted the
president's first apology for the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ended a six-day tour of Russia, Northern Ireland and
Ireland with the domestic scandal dominating every stop on the
foreign itinerary and aides denying that it was affecting his
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's successfully doing the work of our nation here
on the trip and doing what he set out to do on this trip, and he's
not surprised that matters from back home arise. That's not
infrequently the case when this president or any president travels
abroad,'' said Mike McCurry, the White House spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry spoke of the ``parallel universes we live in'' as
Clinton received warm embraces bordering on adulation from the
Irish while in the United States key Democrats denounced Clinton's
affair with Lewinsky and called for some reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman said the president ``takes some satisfaction'' in
his ability to function with world leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``He dealt with world leaders on this trip and (is) confident
that he continues to do good work in the interest of the American
people as he fulfills his constitutional responsibilities,''
McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   But not all agree.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, Clinton held a two-day summit in a gray, drizzling
Moscow with President Boris Yeltsin, but produced little progress.
Yeltsin remained unable to form a new government to combat the
financial crisis in his country that threatens its new democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``How weak President Clinton is and the extent to which it
limits his international influence is still an open question,''
said Paul Saunders, director of the Nixon Center in Washington.
``It is clearly unconstructive for the president of the United
States to be mocked publicly in a foreign country.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia's economy may have fallen through the basement but street
vendors in Moscow were doing a brisk business selling Clinton
``nesting dolls.'' Most sold out quickly. The dolls, one stacked
within another, features Clinton followed by Lewinsky and other
women inside.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, Clinton delivered flat, emotionless speeches about
the need for Russia to stay on the path of market reform. But,
Saunders said Clinton's remarks could anger many Russians who have
lived through years of promises by Yeltsin for reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expectations for the summit were low going in on both sides
for obvious reasons _ neither president is in a position
domestically to deliver much to the other,'' Saunders said.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Bush, with the Center for Strategic and International
Studies, called Clinton ``a very effective and articulate
communicator.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said judging from the response of the Russian media and
his Moscow contacts, ``I would venture to suggest that the summit
was virtually irrelevant in the eyes of the Russian public. They
are undergoing a political, economic and financial meltdown, with
no light at the end of the tunnel.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's appearance with Yeltsin at a news conference at
Catherine Hall, an ornate domed rotunda within the Kremlin took on
a surreal air as the president, looking weary and distracted, knew
Americans reporters would be asking questions about Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   It was his first meeting with the media since his Aug. 17
national address admitting an inappropriate relationship,
expressing regret for misleading Americans and his family and
attacking Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr for his prolonged
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton again turned aside an opportunity to apologize to the
nation and defended his national address as saying what he wanted
to say. The president's reluctance to apologize or display more
contrition apparently helped spark Democrats reaction later in the
week.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., a Clinton ally, ignored pleas
from the White House to await Clinton's return from overseas to
launch a devastating broadside. Lieberman denounced Clinton's
behavior with Lewinsky as ``immoral'' and not just a private matter
as the president had contended.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton received word of Lieberman's address on the Senate floor
as he was making what should have been a triumphant return to
Northern Ireland. The United States helped broker the Good Friday
peace pact which both Protestant and Catholics hope will end
decades of sectarian violence.
</P>
<P>
   Even the supportive Irish News, with its headline ``Clinton
flies in with a brave message of hope,'' couldn't resist a dig at
the president. Its front page had a small cartoon of the
president's limousine traveling down the road with the song Wild
Thing playing.
</P>
<P>
   In Dublin on Friday morning, with Irish Prime Minister Bertie
Ahern at his side, Clinton issued his first direct apology for the
Lewinsky affair and for misleading America. He said he agreed with
Lieberman's comments about his own behavior.
</P>
<P>
   In Limerick, Clinton, accompanied by first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton, drew a huge supportive crowd. Clinton noted that in June
1963, President Kennedy visited Limerick promising to return in the
spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not able to fulfill that promise. But I appreciate the
opportunity to renew it and to thank you for the springtime of hope
the Irish people have given the entire world in 1998,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Austin-based Dell Computers used Clinton's visit to announce an
expansion of its plant in Limerick to create 1,000 new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton later played golf in Ballybunion Golf Club, one of the
world's premier courses, before flying back to the United States.

METS OUTCLUB BRAVES, 5-4 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tony Phillips flew out to end the sixth inning
Saturday, leaving the bases loaded and the Mets trailing the
Atlanta Braves by two runs. But the fiery veteran did not seethe or
sulk; instead, he waited for his next chance.
</P>
<P>
   It came in the eighth inning, with two out, a man on base and
the Mets still trailing, by a run. And Phillips made the most of
it, rocketing a two-run homer over the 396-foot mark in
right-center field. As he made his way around the bases, Phillips
remained calm. But when he crossed home plate, he found the Mets
streaming up onto the steps of the dugout to greet him.
</P>
<P>
   After beating Atlanta in a pitching duel on Friday night, the
Mets won Saturday, 5-4, by outclubbing the Braves at Shea Stadium.
The Mets have maintained in recent days that victories over the
Braves carry no special significance, that they mean no more than
any other victory as the race for the National League's wild-card
berth enters the final stretch. But for the second day in a row,
the emotion they displayed on the field seemed to say otherwise.
The victory left the Mets a half game behind the Chicago Cubs in
the wild-card race, pending the outcome of the Cubs' game Saturday
night in Pittsburgh. It also lifted the Mets 16 games above .500
for the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   The cheers that rained down on Mike Piazza on Friday, when his
two-run homer off Tom Glavine won the game for the Mets, were
spread among the entire team Saturday by a crowd of 43,573. It put
the Mets' attendance at 2,022,792 for the season, the first time
since 1991 that the team surpassed the 2 million mark.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips' home run capped a day of comebacks for the Mets, who
erased a 1-0 deficit early and then trailed by 4-2 before coming
back in their final two at-bats. Turk Wendell earned the victory
with a 1-2-3 eighth inning and John Franco earned his 32nd save by
holding off the Braves in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza continued to be in the middle of Mets rallies. He singled
in the seventh inning to send John Olerud to third base with one
out. When Brian McRae grounded to second, Ozzie Guillen's relay
throw tipped off the fingers of the sliding Piazza. McRae was safe
as the ball skipped in the dirt and Olerud scored on the play to
cut the Braves' lead to 4-3. Piazza received treatment on his hand
and remained in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets threatened in the fourth inning against the Braves'
starter, Kevin Millwood, loading the bases with two out, but could
not score. Brian McRae fouled back the first pitch to him and
Millwood walked off the mound, while the Braves trainer and manager
Bobby Cox came out to investigate. After a moment, Millwood resumed
pitching and McRae drilled his first pitch into left field for a
single. After a passed ball moved McRae to second, Millwood walked
Lenny Harris and Carlos Baerga. But Rey Ordonez flew out to center.
</P>
<P>
   Andruw Jones then put the Braves on top, driving Bobby Jones'
first pitch in the top of the fifth inning over the bleachers in
left-center field for a 457-foot home run, his 26th of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Jones avoided further damage when McRae made a spectacular
grab in center field. Following the home run, Greg Colbrunn reached
base when he was hit in the arm by an off-speed pitch. Then, with
one out, Millwood failed to bunt Colbrunn to second and on a 1-1
count, he swung away and delivered a long drive to straightaway
center. McRae hesitated for a moment and then raced back to the
warning track, reaching out over his left shoulder to snatch the
ball out of the air.
</P>
<P>
   But no one could save Jones in the sixth inning. After Olerud
had briefly given him a 2-1 lead with a two-run homer, his 19th,
Jones could not protect it. Chipper Jones drilled a one-out single
through the box and after a walk to Ryan Klesko, Javy Lopez ripped
Bobby Jones' next pitch up the middle for a run-scoring single.
After Andruw Jones loaded the bases on a roller that stayed just
fair, Colbrunn delivered a drive to the wall in left field.
Phillips raced back, appearing to zero in on it, but the ball
skimmed just past his glove as he collided with the wall and
Colbrunn cruised into second with a two-run double, for the Braves'
4-2 lead.

black youth rally, which earlier this month, was expected to draw
hundreds of thousands of balck youth from around the United States.

   LIMERICK, Ireland _ It was supposed to be a day of joy and
triumph, the long-awaited return to a land where he helped engineer
an unlikely peace.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday night, after President Clinton spoke to every
crowd, shook every last hand, basked in all that praise from
leaders on both sides of the sectarian divide, he arrived at the US
ambassador's residence in Dublin to receive the bad news from
aides. Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, an influential
Democratic moderate, had delivered a scathing speech in Washington
saying Clinton had ``compromised his moral authority.''

   Just like that, what was supposed to be one of the best days of
his presidency was unceremoniously tossed atop the pile of the

</P>
<P>
   There is a loosely held adage in modern American politics that
for a president to seem truly presidential, he must travel abroad _
away from the cynics, the constant barrage of negative television
news coverage, the political rivals who attack with increasing
bite. This was exactly what White House advisers had hoped and
expected when they planned this trip in the late spring.
</P>
<P>
   What they learned instead is that wherever on earth Clinton
travels, the controversy surrounding his affair with Monica S.
Lewinsky will follow close behind _ from his arrival in Russia on
Tuesday morning to his departure from Ireland last night.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow on Wednesday, Clinton's face flushed red at a joint
press conference with President Boris N. Yeltsin when he was asked
about his refusal to apologize. On Thursday, he was reported to be
incensed that Lieberman had clouded his victory tour of Northern
Ireland with the stinging indictment back home. On Friday, when he
apologized during a photo opportunity in the Irish prime minister's
office, his awkward, uncomfortable smile failed to mask his deep
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a reminder of the parallel universes we live in,''
White House press secretary Michael D. McCurry said of the
adulation in the streets of Ireland, contrasted with the criticisms
coming from home.
</P>
<P>
   When aides first planned the summit with Yeltsin, Clinton was
meant to push Russian officials to ratify a nuclear arms treaty and
begin negotiating another historic arms reduction pact that would
bring arsenals to one-fifth of the levels at the height of the Cold
War. Instead, he arrived in Moscow in the throes of the worst
economic crisis in Russia's seven-year history with a free-market
system.
</P>
<P>
   Banks shut their doors. The Russian financial instrument, the
ruble, plunged in value. The financial system seemed to be
crumbling.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts summoned unflattering comparisons between a
Clinton-Yeltsin summit and the meetings of powerful United States
and Soviet presidents during the Cold War. Time and again, the
conversation was of two leaders weakened by controversy staggering
through an ineffectual exercise of diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   To make things worse, Clinton's visit to Moscow seemed to have a
nominal impact. The ruble continued to plummet; the Duma, the lower
house of Parliament, refused to confirm Viktor Chernomyrdin as
prime minister on the eve of Clinton's arrival; and as soon as
Clinton left, Chernomyrdin announced he would like to create an
economic dictatorship early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the week, Clinton, normally a vibrant speaker who
prides himself in making a connection with his audience, appeared
unusually subdued and detached at almsot every stop. At a speech at
Moscow State University, he repeated himself again and again and
barely garnered applause. At an elaborate dinner with Yeltsin that
night, he left a full hour ahead of schedule to retire for the
night.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving in Northern Ireland on Thursday morning, his keynote
speech before an adoring audience of Protestant and Catholic
leaders was so dry that one of Clinton's aides retired to a back
room of the auditorium and promptly fell asleep. In that speech,
Clinton began describing the Good Friday peace agreement, saying,
``This has been a magic ...'' He paused for a moment, searching for
the right word, before adding, ``thing.''
</P>
<P>
   By nightfall, in the city of Armagh, he appeared more at ease,
inspiring a crowd of about 10,000 to a steady stream of applause.
Even there, however, a massive loudspeaker sat alone on a cricket
field far away from the audience, in an indication that the White
House advance team had anticipated a much larger gathering.
</P>
<P>
   His relationship with Hillary Rodham Clinton appeared from a
distance to be one of aloofness. Getting on and off airplanes
together, they barely touched. In Omagh, Northern Ireland, as
British Prime Minister Tony Blair worked a ropeline side by side
with his wife, Mrs. Clinton drifted about 30 yards ahead, shaking
hands alone, and Clinton lagged even further behind.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, aides said Clinton functioned well abroad, but even
their support seemed tempered by the moment. ``He dealt with world
leaders on this trip and is confident that he continues to do good
work in the interest of the American people as he fulfills his
constitutional responsibilities,'' McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   Aides privately pointed to a furious travel schedule and a
series of unexpected developments for Clinton's mood, and said that
he remained neither as upbeat as his advisers like to portray him
or as melancholy as reporters like to describe.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, it was not all bad. In Limerick, an estimated 10,000
residents greeted his motorcade on the route to his hotel Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech Saturday, he declared to a boisterous crowd here,
``This peace is yours, yours and no one else's. All the leaders in
the world, all the speeches in the world, wouldn't amount to a hill
of beans if you hadn't gone out and voted yes and made it loud and
clear.''

   LIMERICK, Ireland _ It was supposed to be a day of joy and
triumph, the long-awaited return to a land where he helped engineer
an unlikely peace.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday night, after President Clinton spoke to every
crowd, shook every last hand, basked in all that praise from
leaders on both sides of the sectarian divide, he arrived at the US
ambassador's residence in Dublin to receive the bad news from
aides. Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, an influential
Democratic moderate, had delivered a scathing speech in Washington
saying Clinton had ``compromised his moral authority.''

NYC POLICE, ORGANIZERS CLASH AT END OF RALLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANCIE LATOUR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For days they had promised peace. And after nearly
four hours Saturday, that promise seemed all but delivered, as a
volatile mix of militant speakers, thousands of marchers, and
scores of police avoided confrontation at the Million Youth March
in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   But at the stroke of 4 p.m. _ the time when a federal court
order said the event must disperse _ the tense peace suddenly
unraveled, and the fears of a community unfolded in a violent,
on-stage clash between police and the fiery organizer of the event,
Khalid Abdul Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
   About 4:01 p.m., when witnesses said Muhammad was making his
closing remarks, police rushed the podium at the corner of 118th
Street and Malcolm X Boulevard in an attempt to reach the
electricity generator that controlled the sound from the stage.
</P>
<P>
   But a corps of Muhammad supporters had surrounded the generator,
and by 4:03 p.m. violence erupted as organizers threw glass bottles
and metal chairs at police dressed in riot gear, and as police in
turn sprayed mace and dragged organizers from the stage in order to
get to the generator.
</P>
<P>
   Panic and confusion seized the crowd, as marchers who had held
their breath through four hours of relative calm suddenly felt
police helicopters hovering about 100 yards above their heads and
police officers four and five lines deep moved in from different
directions to try to disperse the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Lower down on Malcolm X Boulevard, a phalanx of police officers
waited on motorcycles and mounted horseback, poised for the
possibility of a full-fledged riot.
</P>
<P>
   As police vehicles escorted a white Mercedes believed to belong
to Muhammad south on Malcolm X Boulevard and away from the site of
the march, organizers pleaded with the gathered audience to go
home, shouting into bullhorns as police took over the stage and
began dismantling it.
</P>
<P>
   By 4:30 p.m., the crowd had been moved out of the area, but the
side streets were jammed with people.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said that one person had been arrested
and that more arrests were expected.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 people suffered minor injuries, according to emergency
service personnel. Police said 15 officers had been injured.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes before Muhammad took to the stage in the final minutes
before 4 p.m., the crowd had responded with cheers and wild
applause as one of his lieutenants shouted from the stage, ``We're
supposed to lose this permit at 4 o'clock, but to hell with them!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Beat the hell out of them with the railing if they so much as
touch you!'' Muhammad had said to the crowd. ``Look the bastards in
the eye. Take their guns and use it on them.''
</P>
<P>
   The tumult ended a day that was promoted as a followup to the
Million Man March in Washington in 1995 and the Million Woman March
in Philadelphia last year.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday's event drew only several thousand, and attracted
most of its attention from Giuliani's efforts to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani called the event ``a march of hate,'' and the city
denied a permit to the organizers. But they won a challenge in US
District Court last month on the grounds that the city's refusal
was unconstitutional and arbitrary.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a panel of three federal appeals judges narrowed the
length of the march from 29 blocks to six and cut the schedule from
12 to 4 hours.
</P>
<P>
   More than 3,000 police officers were sent to the area in a show
of force that had some residents complaining the scene was more a
police state than a youth rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is overkill,'' said state Senator David Paterson,
who represents Harlem. Paterson, who organized a force of 500
volunteers as ``peacekeepers,'' said there was ``a strong, visible
artillery in the area.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's just antagonizing the crowd,'' said Paterson,
adding that he opposed the march but was on hand to ensure
participants' safety.
</P>
<P>
   But in spite of the overwhelming presence of police officers on
Malcolm X Boulevard, on rooftops, and in helicopters that
occasionally passed over the crowd, and in spite of the scorching
speeches that focused mostly on the city's attempts to stop the
march, some young people said they were inspired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to see our black brothers and sisters getting
together,'' said Terrell Cliett, 11, who had come by bus from West
Philadelphia with his mother and 30 other parents and youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like what they're saying,'' the boy said of the speakers.
``They're trying to get black people to remember that they're like
everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamar Williams helped advertise the march in his hometown of
Baltimore and said he was glad he came.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is very positive. The kids need something like
this,'' said Williams, 19.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell's mother, Charlynn Cliett, had one criticism of the
event. She said she wanted her son to experience the march because
she felt she had gained a lot from the Million Woman March. But she
was disappointed that the program focused heavily on adult issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a little over the children's head,'' Cliett said.
``I don't really think it's geared to the children too much.''

SOME WORLD WAR I VETERANS ARE STILL WITH US
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: How many soldiers are still alive from the First World War?
</P>
<P>
   _ M.R.K., Harvard, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A: Out of 4.73 million Americans who served during World War I,
an estimated 3,200 are alive today. They range in age from 94 to
116.
</P>
<P>
   These figures come from Muriel Sue Parkhurst, who
single-handedly runs Veterans of World War I of the USA Inc. from
her Alexandria, Va., home. When she began working for the
organization in 1975, it had 21 full-time employees working for
750,000 surviving veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Parkhurst said that most of these vets never received pensions
or other benefits, and many retired before Social Security. They
sometimes seek help with eyeglasses, hearing aids, discharge papers
and the return of stolen medals. To contact the group, write to Box
8027, Alexandria, VA 22306-8027, or call (703) 780-5660.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice for these men and women to realize they're not
alone,'' Parkhurst said. Subscriptions to the group's newsletter
are sent for donations of $5 or more, which fund its bimonthly
publication.
</P>
<P>
   World War I survivors are the nation's oldest group of veterans.
The last Spanish-American War veteran died in 1992 at age 106, and
the last Civil War veteran died in 1956 at 112, according to
Veterans Administration records.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened to the red-haired actress Anita Morris? I
thought she died, but what's her story? She was so talented.
</P>
<P>
   _ T.S.N, Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: Morris died of cancer at age 50 on March 3, 1994, in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   After 15 years on Broadway, the actress was a Drama Desk Award
winner and Tony Award nominee for her role in the 1982 Broadway
musical ``Nine.''
</P>
<P>
   Her movie projects included ``The Hotel New Hampshire,''
``Ruthless People'' and ``Radioland Murders,'' which was released
posthumously.
</P>
<P>
   Time magazine called her best role that of ``Danny DeVito's
scheming, Dustbuster-addicted mistress in `Ruthless People.'''

WOULD-BE CLONER SAYS HE'LL START WITH HIMSELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Richard Seed, the maverick physicist who provoked
widespread opposition earlier this year by announcing plans to
clone humans, said Saturday that because of the medical risks
involved he has decided that the first person he tries to copy will
be himself.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that _ the 69-year-old Seed said his wife, Gloria, has
agreed to carry the embryo that would be created by combining the
nucleus of one of Seed's cells with a donor egg.
</P>
<P>
   Since cloning, even in livestock mammals, carries the risk of
stillbirths or abnormal fetuses, there are clearly risks associated
with the present technology, Seed said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So,'' he said, ``I have decided to clone myself first to
defuse the criticism that I'm taking advantage of desperate women
with a procedure that's not proven.''
</P>
<P>
   Seed, who has been little heard from since his announcement last
January, was by turns sober, provocative, and humorous as he spoke
at the meeting in Boston of the Association for Politics and the
Life Sciences, a group of academic researchers probing the
influences of biology and evolution on political behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that clones would be ``fun'' and would unleash a
``torrent of research,'' Seed declared that learning to reprogram
an adult cell's nucleus (as was done in creating the lamb clone
Dolly) would be the first step toward discovering immortality.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the cloning of animals has been advancing
rapidly, going from sheep to cows to mice in less than two years,
the political and legal status of human cloning remains uncertain.
A five-year moratorium declared by President Clinton is apparently
being observed by main-stream scientists, but Congress has failed
to act on legislation to outlaw human cloning.
</P>
<P>
   Seed continued Saturday to insist defiantly that he has support
for cloning and the ``bioethicists have no constituency.'' He said
he has received several hundred calls, including several from
parents of dying children who say they are interested in cloning
them, and has been invited by two foreign countries to set up shop
there.
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists have declined to take Seed's plans seriously,
saying he has neither the means nor the money. He is not a medical
doctor, though he has performed embryo research. He said Saturday
he has done ``a little bit of work'' toward his goal and has raised
some money, but needs much more.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he insisted that his Human Clone Clinic located
near Chicago will produce a pregnancy with a human clone within
21/2 years. The US Food and Drug Administration warned in January
that it would halt any human cloning attempts by Seed or anyone
else, but speakers Saturday said they doubted the FDA has
jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday Seed's presence, representing at least the possibility
of serious human cloning attempts, enlivened Saturday's discussions
of the pros and cons of cloning and efforts to regulate it. At
present, two states _ California and Michigan _ have banned human
cloning and dozens of other states are considering bans.
</P>
<P>
   From an initial reaction following the cloning of Dolly the lamb
in 1996 that human cloning would be unthinkable, the debate now
seems to have moved toward acceptance that it is probably
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few applications seem likely to be attempted, speakers
said Saturday: to produce a child for an infertile couple unable to
conceive in any other way: to replace a dead child if conventional
reproduction was impossible, or to produce a child who could donate
bone marrow or some other vital tissue to a seriously ill family
member.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Wertz, a senior scientist and genetics specialist at the
Shriver Center in Waltham, said many of the standard arguments
against cloning are flawed. The notion that cloning is ``an affront
to human dignity'' and individuality is based on the erroneous
notion that clones would in fact be identical because of identical
genes. ``We are not our genes'' but subject to many environmental
influences, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wertz argued that human cloning is not inherently unethical and
should not be banned prematurely, and predicted that in time it
will become acceptable just like such formerly deprecated practices
as test-tube fertilization, donor insemination, and creation of
single-parent families.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely that headless human clones would be created as a
source of spare body parts, since taking the parts would amount to
murder, she said.

SMOKE IN THE COCKPIT: PILOTS ARE OFTEN UNPREPARED  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ The only problem that the crew of
Swissair Flight 111 reported to air controllers before the crash on
Wednesday night was smoke in the cockpit, but smoke alone can bring
a plane down, even if the fire that produced it does not disable
crucial mechanical or electrical parts.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows yet what made the Swissair plane, an MD-11, crash
into the sea. But in recent years the National Transportation
Safety Board has studied several in-flight fires, some that caused
disasters and some in which crashes were only narrowly averted, and
found that pilots are sometimes not adequately prepared to try to
fly a plane from a smoky cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   Cockpits in airliners are stocked with goggles that cover the
eyes and oxygen masks that cover the nose and mouth. Using them is
``absolutely critical for the survival of the aircraft, and the
people on it,'' said an aviation fire safety expert who testified
at a safety board hearing into the crash of a Valujet DC-9 in the
Florida Everglades. That crash, which occurred in May 1996, was
caused by a fire in the cargo hold. The expert, Robert P. Massi,
who himself narrowly escaped death in a cockpit fire in a small
plane, said: ``If you can't see, and you can't breathe, you can't
fly. It's that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the sound of his voice, the Swissair pilot who was
speaking to air controllers before the crash apparently put on his
mask in the last minutes of the flight, investigators said on
Saturday. They are hoping to recover the cockpit voice recorder,
and hope that it will shed more light on the amount of smoke in the
cockpit and its effect on the crew.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say pilots are usually reluctant to put on their masks
and goggles. One problem is that the goggles are like a horse's
blinders, limiting peripheral vision, making it hard to scan the
instruments and the view outside. Turning the head to scan back and
forth can cause vertigo.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that pilots who wear glasses generally cannot
fit them under the goggles. One expert said at the Valujet hearing
that in some cases pilots had taken off their glasses to put on
goggles, only to find that they could not read the emergency
checklists.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you have a dilemma,'' said Gregory Feith, a safety board
investigator in the Valujet case. ``Either you breathe or you see,
but possibly you can't do both,'' he said. The safety board called
for the development of protective equipment, either masks and
goggles or one-piece units, that could be put on more quickly, and
were more comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Also, pilots are generally reluctant to put on goggles or masks,
figuring that they will wait until the smoke gets heavier. But
according to experts who testified at the Valujet hearing, smoke
can increase so rapidly that by the time the masks are really
needed, it is too late.
</P>
<P>
   And even if they put on the masks, if the smoke is too thick the
pilots will be unable to read the instrument panels. Without being
able to see the airspeed indicator or the artificial horizon, which
indicates the wings' angle relative to the ground, pilots would
find the plane very hard to fly.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some planes do not carry enough oxygen to last more
than 15 minutes, and often it takes longer than that to land a
plane flying at high altitude. Flight 111 crashed 16 minutes after
the pilots first radioed for help.
</P>
<P>
   Fires have other ways to make planes crash. In the case of older
planes like DC-9s, fires can destroy the mechanical cables that
connect the cockpit controls with the flaps, ailerons, and rudder.
Newer designs, like the MD-11, use electrical cables, but fires can
cut those, too. The flight data recorder, if it continued to
function, might indicate the loss of various pieces of equipment as
a fire progressed; failure of the flight data recorder itself would
be a clue.

LIGHTHOUSE BECOMES A MARKER FOR MOURNERS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By RANDY KENNEDY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEGGY'S COVE, Nova Scotia _ For as long as anyone here can
remember, the red-and-white lighthouse that stands sentinel on the
craggy shoreline has been a kind of landmark, because it was the
first in Canada to double as a post office, used by the 60
residents of this tiny fishing village.
</P>
<P>
   But on Saturday, as hundreds of distraught relatives of the
victims of Swissair Flight 111 poured in, the picture-postcard
tower became another sort of landmark, an impromptu grave marker to
mourners who may never recover their loved ones' bodies and who
have no other point on a map to call a resting place for the dead.
</P>
<P>
   The families began arriving hourly just after 8 on Saturday
morning, and streamed slowly up a jagged hill to the lighthouse,
leaving daisies and irises and pink roses in the rocky crevices
along the way. Some gathered pebbles or rocks to carry back with
them. Others crouched down, as if trying to get closer to the
roaring surf below. Still others simply separated from family
members and walked along the shore alone. They stared out at the
horizon, where Canadian Coast Guard and Navy ships in the recovery
effort were dimly visible.
</P>
<P>
   One man left a sky-blue card in which he had written: ``Words
cannot express what I'm feeling for all of you right now. May God
be with you, my friends. Maurice.''
</P>
<P>
   All the mourners seemed to be searching for something. But
several said that despite the sense of indefiniteness that has
engulfed them over the last three days, it helped to go to the
landpoint nearest to where the jet went into the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just something to hold on to,'' said Tim Larson, 39, of
East Hartford, Conn., whose wife's uncle, Victor Rizza, 58, and Mr.
Rizza's son, Antonino, were killed.
</P>
<P>
   As Larson began to talk to reporters near the lighthouse, he
looked around him at the picturesque town nestled around the cove
and started to say something about it. But he was only able to say,
``This is such a pretty town,'' before his voice cracked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You read about this stuff,'' he said, ``and you see it, and
it's never supposed to happen to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Family and friends of the victims tended to speak on Saturday of
things that should have happened. Larson said his wife's family had
planned a reunion for 2000 in Sicily, where Rizza owned a chemical
company and was a college professor.
</P>
<P>
   Rizza and his son were flying to Geneva on their way to
Stuttgart, where Rizza's son, known as Nino, lived with his mother.
The two had been in Hartford visiting their American relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot of Flight 111, Urs Zimmermann, would have celebrated
his 50th birthday Saturday night in Switzerland, said Capt. Werner
Naef, a Swissair pilot. Naef flew victims' families to Halifax from
Switzerland on Friday and visited the shore here on Saturday with
10 other Swissair crewmen who had worked with the Flight 111 crew.
</P>
<P>
   Naef added that one of the flight attendants aboard Flight 111
was on her first journey as a Swissair crewman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to express to all the victims' families,'' he said,
first in English and then in German, ``that our hearts and our love
are with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The emotions of the mourners veered wildly.
</P>
<P>
   Just after noon, one woman could be seen walking very quickly
across the rocks near the lighthouse toward wooden police barriers
that were erected to prevent mourners from venturing too close to
the dangerous waves. A counselor restrained the woman after she
passed the barriers and began to walk toward the water.
</P>
<P>
   Some family members were dressed in funereal black, and wept,
visibly shaking, as they walked toward the water. Others were
dressed like tourists _ khaki pants and fanny packs and tennis
shoes _ and they held hands or they put their arms around one
another's shoulders. Red Cross and Salvation Army workers shuttled
between the lighthouse and large green military tents with boxes of
tissues and, after the wind picked up, stacks of gray wool
blankets.
</P>
<P>
   As one elderly man made his way up the stairs to the lighthouse,
his shoulders shaking, he collapsed. Officials said they did not
know whether he fell or suffered some type of seizure. He was
carried off the hill on a stretcher and taken to a hospital in
Halifax.
</P>
<P>
   In the background throughout the day were the uncertainties that
linger for the families: What made the jet's cockpit fill with
smoke? How quickly did their loved ones die? When will their family
members' bodies be identified so they can go home and grieve
outside the glare of floodlights?
</P>
<P>
   ``We all want to know what happened as quickly as possible,''
Naef said. For others, those answers were less important.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it doesn't make a lot of difference, because they're
gone,'' said Claire Mortimer, whose father, John H. Mortimer, 75,
and stepmother, Hilda B. Mortimer, 69, were on the flight en route
to a vacation in France.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mortimer said that what has been most important to her so
far are the assurances of crash investigators, who told families on
Friday that it appears the jet hit the water with unbelievable
impact. That means, she said, her voice calm and even, that ``they
died fast'' and did not suffer.
</P>
<P>
   She added that she perhaps drew more comfort than some of the
families who went to the cove, because her father, her stepmother
and her mother, who died many years ago, all loved the Atlantic
Coast. At the end of June, the family celebrated Mortimer's 75th
birthday at the family's summer home in Ogunquit, on the Maine
coast, with clams and lobsters and a soccer game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would have loved this place,'' she said, and added later:
``In some ways, this feels like a very logical completion.''
</P>
<P>
   As the line of family members wound up and down the hill all
day, somber village residents looked on, and many cried with the
mourners.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy and Art Gilbert, from White's Lake, just a few miles down
the road, drove in with 130 loads of bread donated by a bakery in
Halifax. After they delivered the bread and other food, the couple
stood talking quietly in sight of the lighthouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people come to see it now,'' Mrs. Gilbert said, ``I guess
it will mean something a little different.''

TRANSCRIPTS SHOW JET PREPARED FOR EMERGENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ Transcripts released yesterday of the
final communications between the pilots of doomed Swissair 111 and
Canadian air traffic controllers show calm preparations for an
emergency landing dissolving into calls, apparently from behind
oxygen masks in a smoky cabin, for an immediate touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Swissair 111 heavy is declaring `Pan Pan Pan','' or distress,
one of the pilots told controllers Wednesday night about 70 miles
southwest of Halifax. ``We have smoke in the cockpit, request
deviate immediate right turn to a convenient place, I guess
Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   The controller responded: ``Would you prefer to go into
Halifax?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Affirmative for Swissair 111 ... prefer Halifax from our
position,'' the pilot said.
</P>
<P>
   But about 30 miles from Halifax International Airport, the pilot
told controllers in Moncton, New Brunswick, that he needed more
distance and that he also needed to dump excessive fuel that would
have made a landing at Halifax very risky.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Swissair 111 was given clearance to make a left
turn and is believed to have begun dumping fuel over the ocean at
10,000 feet. The pilots never responded to two authorizations to
dispose of their fuel, and their MD-11 aircraft with 229 passengers
and crew soon began turning in a tight circle that ended with a
plunge into the cold Atlantic on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Ten minutes after the distress call came the last transmission
from the aircraft, as it began heading over St. Margaret's Bay:
``We are declaring an emergency at time zero-one-two-four ... We
are starting to vent now. We have to land immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Six minutes later, the aircraft struck the water off Peggy's
Cove. Everybody aboard was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Although the jet came within 25 miles of the airport before
turning in a broad arc toward the ocean, chief crash investigator
Vic Gerden said the aircraft would have been 30 tons overweight if
it had attempted to touch down while carrying the bulk of the fuel
needed to take it across the Atlantic and on to Zurich.
</P>
<P>
   ``You risk that it would have gone off the end of the runway at
an unknown rate of speed,'' said Gerden, of the Canadian
Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   Any such landing would have risked the plane's landing gear
crashing through its wings or the fuselage breaking up into a
fireball, said a high-ranking official of the US National
Transportation Safety Board, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   As Gerden briefed reporters on the day's events, relatives of
the victims were receiving another briefing from the disaster team.
</P>
<P>
   By late Saturday, one body _ of a French national _ had been
identified at the chapel on a military base near Halifax that is
serving as a collection point for both human remains and aircraft
pieces.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, only small pieces of the jet had been recovered,
although search teams believe they are zeroing in on the aircraft's
transponder, which should bring them closer to the main fuselage
and the flight-data recorder that could hold the key to this crash.
</P>
<P>
   So far, five semi-trailer trucks have been used to store the
personal belongings that are washing up on the beaches and have
been retrieved from the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Family members will be allowed today to begin viewing and
identifying personal items, such as wallets, passports, and
personal papers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite 6-foot rolling seas and 25 m.p.h. winds, the salvage
effort continued Saturday in a 50-mile-long area along the rocky
coast of southeastern Nova Scotia. More than 600 military and
civilian personnel patrolled broad sections of the shore in an
expanding search for remains of the passengers and of Flight 111.
</P>
<P>
   Below the surface of the Atlantic, about 75 Canadian military
divers plunged as deep as 190 feet near the estimated point of
impact to scour the ocean floor for large portions of the MD-11
jet. They were aided by a Canadian submarine, whose sonar was used
to detect any anomalies in the charted ocean bottom that might be
broken pieces of the airliner. Remote-control submersible cameras
also were being used.
</P>
<P>
   Assistance has been offered by the United States, as well as
from other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Sergeant Andre Guertin of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said
the search had been concentrated on a 15-square-kilometer area near
where the aircraft's fuel slick was first discovered.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the largest remnant of the jet to be recovered has been
a 3-by-3-foot fragment. Many of the bodies of the 229 passengers
and crew may still be in the fuselage of the Swissair jet, which
was delivered to the airline by McDonnell-Douglas in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Guertin said that treacherous tides, currents, and winds off
Peggy's Cove have complicated the search, but that ``we will only
stop searching when the possibility of finding every body has been
exhausted.'' Formal identification of human remains had not begun
Saturday, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian investigators plan to reassemble the aircraft at
Shearwater military base near Halifax to find clues into the cause
of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian military and police boats were used Saturday to deliver
wreaths from victims' relatives to the crash site. Because of the
rough seas, the families were not brought out on the open water.
They were, however, allowed to collect samples of water from the
ocean near picturesque Peggy's Cove.
</P>
<P>
   Memorial services are planned today at a church near the village
and also at a cathedral in Halifax. An estimated 800 relatives and
friends of the victims had arrived in Nova Scotia by Saturday.

ASTRONAUTS (Undated) _ John, Scott, Wally, Gordo.Just four of them

Apollo I, back in the glory days. Deke died of cancer in 1993. They
used to be seven _ America's original astronauts, men who strapped
themselves into test planes over California's deserts and then into
Corvettes and rocket ships in Florida, always competing to be the
fastest, go the highest, be the best. They're in their 70s now and
they haven't lost their famous drive to compete. ``I'm afraid John

OVERTIME (Undated) _ By the time his 15-year career with
Albertson's stores ended, Richard Sorrells knew the extra hours at
work were taking their toll. ``I'd come home grumping and griping _
I was stressed'' after routinely putting in at least 10 hours of
extra work a week, said Sorrells, now a Glendale business owner.
``I've got a 4-year-old daughter. She doesn't need to hear that.''
Like Sorrells, Americans are feeling as overworked as ever this
Labor Day. Frustrated by working too many hours _ both paid and
unpaid _ they are sometimes grabbing headlines by battling the
corporations whose profits depend on their extra work. From a
national lawsuit filed against Albertson's grocery stores to the
recently concluded US West strike, the number of hours spent on the
job is a flashpoint for employee discontent. By PAT FLANNERY. Story

NOPHONES (Phoenix) _ When 64-year-old Sheila Brown moved from one
apartment to another within her complex last month, she expected to
be without a telephone for about a day. But the US West strike has
left the Phoenix woman, who lives alone and suffers from chronic
asthma attacks and other health problems, fighting to get her new

legislative races. There's nothing,'' said Phoenix attorney Tim
Hogan, who was stunned recently when he opened his sample
Democratic primary ballot and found no reason to participate. There
really isn't anything to vote for in my district, so I guess I've
got to wonder what the point is,'' Hogan said. His dismay reflects
a growing concern over the fate of Arizona's second-largest
political party. The harsh reality is that the Democratic Party is
in its weakest position in years, and if it suffers
across-the-board losses in statewide races in November, it could
emerge powerless for a generation. By MICHAEL MURPHY. Story will

CRASH INQUIRY FINDS A SILENCE FROM THE CREW  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ The crew of the Swissair jet that crashed
near here on Wednesday night had stopped responding to air traffic
controllers about six minutes before the plane, an MD-11 with 229
people on board, hit the water, investigators said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators also said that on Friday they had detected the
homing device from one of the plane's ``black boxes,'' either the
cockpit voice recorder or the flight data recorder. Divers spent
Saturday morning trying to find the recorder, they said, but had to
be called back because of bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   The chief investigator, Vic Gerden, said that shortly after the
plane's last radio transmission, in which a crewman told a
controller at the Moncton Area Control Center, ``We have to land
immediately,'' the plane's transponder also stopped working. That
piece of equipment transmits the plane's identity and altitude to
controllers, and when its signal stopped, radar data from the plane
became much less reliable, Gerden said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, with 215 passengers and a crew of 14, plunged into
the sea at 10:30 local time on Wednesday night, about 40 miles from
Halifax Airport, killing everyone aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Even the brief excerpts of the conversations between a
controller in Moncton and the crew _ released here Saturday night _
show flashes of drama and tension. Someone on the plane _ whether
the captain or the first officer _ tells the controller: ``We are
declaring an emergency at time zero one two four ... we are
starting vent now. We have to land immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerden said he was consulting with Swissair pilots and MD-11
experts about what ``starting vent'' means. It could have meant
depressurizing the airplane to allow the cockpit windows to be
opened, or dumping fuel, which the crew had said it would have to
do, Gerden said.
</P>
<P>
   But he would not characterize the tone of the exchanges or say
what had been going on in the cockpit in the final minutes. Asked
why the transponder stopped working, he said that the failure might
be ``indicating some electrical issue, potentially.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the crew's tone of voice, Gerden said that it had
changed in the course of the 10 minutes, probably indicating that
they had put on oxygen masks. ``I really don't have enough
information to determine their condition inside the cockpit, I'm
afraid,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He cites smoke, but we really don't know what density of
smoke, what amount,'' Gerden said.
</P>
<P>
   In a briefing that lasted more than an hour, Gerden gave a
limited chronology of the last few minutes of the flight, beginning
at a point about 70 nautical miles from here.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, under the control of the Moncton Center, radioed in:
``Swissair 111 heavy is declaring pan-pan-pan. We have smoke in the
cockpit, request deviate immediate right turn to a convenient
place, I guess Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Advised that the plane was 300 nautical miles from Boston, the
crew readily agreed to go to Halifax, but when told that the
airport was just 30 miles away, the pilot said, ``We need more than
30 miles.'' The controller told the plane to turn left to lose
altitude.
</P>
<P>
   Gerden said he would have experts analyze whether it was
possible to drop from the 33,000-foot cruising altitude to the
runway, which is not far above sea level, in the 30 miles
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem, he said, was weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aircraft at that point, about that time, had a weight of
about 230 metric tons,'' he said. But it cannot land weighing more
than 200 metric tons, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have taken probably in the vicinity of 12 minutes of
flying to dump that amount of fuel,'' he said. ``If one attempts to
land an aircraft at a weight that is greater than the maximum
landing weight, depending on many conditions _ length of runway,
surface condition of runway, is it wet, many other factors _ there
is a risk having landed the aircraft it would go off the other end
of the runway at some unknown rate of speed and cause damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether, in hindsight, the crew might have done better
risking that than falling into the sea, he said, ``The crew had a
difficult situation to contend with, starting with a high altitude
and having to descend quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty miles, he said, was very short if the crew wanted to
``descend into an airport that you weren't expecting to descend
into.''
</P>
<P>
   The crew would have had to make a very quick decision, he said,
about risking a landing above the maximum landing weight ``and at
the same time, contending with some problem, unknown at this
time.''

 &HT;    Investors will get key signals in the coming weeks
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investors will find little to feel festive about this Labor Day,
the last holiday of a dismal summer in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   As they prepared for the weekend, many knew they were suddenly
less wealthy by ... 5 percent? 10 percent? More?
</P>
<P>
   Now, with an extra day to think about it, investors want to know
what comes next. No one knows for sure, but there are signposts
they can look for in coming weeks that offer clues to where the
market is going:
</P>
<P>
   Earnings pre-announcements: Often bad news released early by a
company, they offer a tip-off to which way profits will go in the
latest quarter, especially for big companies. Third quarter
pre-announcements will occur this month and in early October.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings announcements: These are the official company reports,
mostly in the month after the quarter ends. Just as important as
the earnings are comments and forecasts by management about the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates: Second only to earnings, interest rate trends
provide clues to the future. They have trended lower for most of
the 1990s. In a period of earnings weakness, stocks become more
dependent on an environment of steady or declining interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve: The nation's central bank is under pressure
to cut short-term interest rates as a signal of support to the
stock market, much as it did after the October 1987 crash. Analysts
say a rate cut would almost certainly boost the market. Watch for
Fed action _ or inaction _ when it meets three more times this
year: Sept. 29, Nov. 17 and Dec. 22.
</P>
<P>
   The economy: Typically, bear markets do not occur during an
economic boom, which means the continued strength of the economy is
important. Look especially at government reports on job growth and
unemployment, usually in the first week of each month, and on
inflation _ the Producer Price Index for wholesale prices, the
Consumer Price Index for retail prices.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign crises: The slowest, most difficult changes affecting
the market almost certainly will occur overseas, where foreign
governments may or may not do the right thing from the U.S.
perspective. By all accounts, the U.S. is less dependent on foreign
trade than most nations, but the world's problems clearly have a
psychological impact on investors, especially those of Asia and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic crises. Analysts aren't sure what impact President
Clinton's embarrassment will have, or how it will end. For the most
part, it shouldn't affect the market unless Clinton is impeached or
resigns. His successor, and which party controls Congress, are more
likely to impact the market.

 &HT;    Sierra Club's anti-Faircloth ad gets mixed results
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ The Sierra Club this weekend concluded
$600,000 worth of unregulated issue advertising in nearly two dozen
states that both hammered and praised members of Congress for their
votes on the environ- ment.
</P>
<P>
   This college town in eastern Carolina was ground zero in the
club's North Carolina campaign against Sen. Lauch Faircloth
(R-N.C.), who faces a tough re-election fight against John Edwards,
a millionaire attorney who has the endorsement of the Sierra Club's
political action committee. The Sierra Club spent $45,000 here and
in Raleigh to convince viewers that Faircloth, among the Senate's
most conservative members, has a poor record on the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Club organizers in Washington declared the campaign a
success at a news conference in the nation's Capital last week. But
here in the small towns of eastern Carolina, around local lunch
counters and in main street shops, the reviews were decidedly
mixed. Some voters said they simply hadn't seen the ad. Others said
they tuned it out as soon as they saw it was ``political.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Hickman, a homemaker from Kinston, N.C., thought it was a
``pretty ad,'' but wasn't quite sure who paid for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously a political ad,'' said Larry Economos, an
attorney from Greenville who is supporting Edwards. ``When you see
it, you wonder what connection it has to Edwards' campaign. It's a
good ad for Edwards.''
</P>
<P>
   The views of Economos and other voters across eastern Carolina
suggest that voters are far more skeptical of issue ads than the
ads' sponsors might wish to believe. Message is one thing. How it
is received is quite another.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me want to vote for Faircloth,'' said Joe Burchette
over a plate of fried chicken at Christopher's on the main street
in Kinston, N.C. ``Because I don't like liberals and the way they
want me to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Issue ads such as ``Fish Kill,'' the spot that aired here,
increasingly are becoming the political tool of choice for
tax-exempt organizations like the Sierra Club. Without telling
voters to vote for or against a candidate, the organizations escape
federal limitations on how they must raise their money and disclose
where it comes from.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation pending in Congress would require organizations to
abide by the same fund-raising limitations candidates face if they
air issue ads featuring the name or likeness of a candidate 60 days
before an election. The Sierra Club supports the legislation. But
Dan Weiss, the club's political director, noted that the club's ads
in North Carolina and elsewhere wouldn't have been subject to the
law anyway because they ran more than 60 days before the November
election.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant Kittrell, a commercial real estate agent in Greenville,
said he thought it was wrong for the Sierra Club to air the ad
without disclosing who paid for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfair for any group, whether an environmental group or
any other group to spend money like that,'' Kittrell said. ``I'm
supportive of the rivers, but I don't like that veiled type of
advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   Contents of the ad
</P>
<P>
   The ad against Faircloth, a 70-year-old farmer from Clinton,
N.C., highlighted the senator's support of a clean water bill that
would have drastically rewritten the nation's wetlands laws,
exempting more than 50 percent of wetlands now under federal
protection. The bill also would have exempted some farmlands,
including those owned by hog farmers such as Faircloth, and the
Sierra Club's ad pointed that out.
</P>
<P>
   The ad also featured the serious pollution problems of North
Carolina's rivers, many of which have been temporarily closed
during the past several years because of outbreaks of the
mysterious fish-killing organism known as pfiesteria. Some
environmentalists think the excessive nitrates released into the
environment from hog farms is to blame for the rivers' woes.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Ocorr, a retired school teacher from New Bern, N.C., the
scene of some of the state's worst fish kills, said over coffee at
a local coffee shop here that voters need to know Faircloth owns
hog farms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they know his involvement in the hog industry,''
she said. ``He's got all his money to put up slick advertising, and
I think people should know he has another record. People need to
see a balanced picture.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club's decision to feature local rivers in the ad _
it was actually shot on the Neuse River, which runs through New
Bern _ reflected the belief that voters don't connect to issues
unless they are in their back yard. They targeted eastern North
Carolina because they believe the message about clean water would
resonate most here.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the voters interviewed here said the environment was
an important issue, and they frequently mentioned their concern
over the local hog industry's impact on the environment. But they
weren't necessarily willing to adopt the Sierra Club's argument
that Faircloth was to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't blame him for the hogs, because he don't own them
all,'' said Jimmy Faircloth (no relation to the senator), who lives
in Clinton. ``It's a large industry. It's made up of more than one
individual.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we all care about the environment,'' said Kevin Davis,
a youth minister from New Bern. ``I just think no matter who you
vote for, that's not going to change the Neuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Cannon, a 30-year-old ``die-hard Republican,'' said the ad
made him want to call Faircloth's office and tell the senator to
support pro-environment legislation. He still plans to vote for
Faircloth in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with him on a lot of other issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Cannon's father, Carlos Cannon, said the ad raised questions
in his mind about Faircloth.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he can't vote the way he should vote, maybe we need a
change,'' said the elder Cannon from behind his music store counter
in Kinston. ``I'd love to hear from (Faircloth). The wait-and-see
attitude ain't going to work for him, because that ad is pretty
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Fuller, Faircloth's campaign manager, defended Faircloth's
record, but he said the campaign has no plans to respond to the
Sierra Club's ad. ``If we thought it was doing us some harm, we
would have responded to it,'' Fuller said.

 &HT;    Women help change face of the South
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HICKORY, N.C. _ Buffeted by crosscurrents of ethnic, educational
and economic change, the South, like Elvis, is ``all shook up.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the conclusion of the second annual State of the South
report, released today by an economic think tank.
</P>
<P>
   The report says the South's leaders face daunting challenges on
top of the centuries-old problems of racism, poverty and
illiteracy.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest challenges: The rapidly rising population of
Hispanics, Asians and other ethnic groups in the South could
increasingly become a source of tension in communities and in the
workplace.
</P>
<P>
   And one of the most significant trends: In both education and
jobs, men are losing ground to women.
</P>
<P>
   More women than men now attend college in the South.
</P>
<P>
   And in percentage terms, the participation of women in the work
force is growing steadily, while men's participation is going down.
Armed with better educations, women gradually are closing the pay
gap with men.
</P>
<P>
   The disappearance of men from the work force is especially
evident in Appalachia, northeast Mississippi and other areas where
traditional factory jobs are fading and new jobs are slow to fill
the void, said George Autry, president of MDC Inc., which published
the report. It was funded by the Ford Foundation, the Z. Smith
Reynolds Foundation, the Wachovia Foundation and the U.S.
Department of Labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``More often, (unemployed men) are winding up in jail or in the
underground economy,'' Autry said. ``They could be hustling,
running drugs, doing occasional day labor or living off their
girlfriends.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in a reversal of the African-American exodus from the
South in the three decades after World War II, migration of black
people to the region reached record levels in the 1990s. Most were
lured by jobs in cities _ including the No. 1 destination, Atlanta
_ rather than by nostalgic longings for their old family homes,
according to the report. The newcomers are better educated than the
black adults who have spent their lives in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``The black migration pattern is part of a larger story of the
reversal of the brain drain,'' noted MDC, a Chapel Hill, N.C., firm
that tracks economic and work force trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The South is now attracting, rather than losing, the most
highly educated.''
</P>
<P>
   Alice Hackett can vouch for the new report.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, Hackett moved to Hickory, N.C., a working-class
community east of Asheville in the southern fringes of Appalachia.
Then she got an education and landed a job.
</P>
<P>
   The 34-year-old mother of four went from living in a shelter for
battered women in nearby Lenoir to renting a four-bedroom home
outside of Hickory. Her knack for mechanics led her to an
associate's degree in automotive repair at Catawba Valley Community
College and then to a technician's job at the local Volvo
dealership.
</P>
<P>
   She even holds down a second job on weekends fixing broken
bowling machines at Colonial Lanes.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Hackett landed a job working the service counter at
Armstrong Ford, and now she's earning the best money of her life:
as much as $400 a week.
</P>
<P>
   She enjoys the work, but occasionally, she said, the phone rings
and the caller ``wants to talk to a man. They think I am the
secretary to the service manager.''
</P>
<P>
   MDC noted a sharp increase in the number of Southern families
with both parents working and in families headed by a single
working parent.
</P>
<P>
   That has resulted in a big gap between the median income of
two-earner families ($56,000 in 1996) and female-headed families
($18,000 in 1996).
</P>
<P>
   ``Too often, single mothers are thrice cursed,'' the report
states, noting that women typically earn less than men, often lack
higher educations, and support families on a single income.
</P>
<P>
   The report warns that the gap between the haves and the
have-nots ``is widening, even as the South becomes more prosperous
than ever. A more economically powerful South now faces a test: Can
it give more families the capacity to improve their prospects in
life, especially the millions of Southern families headed by single
parents and families of newly arrived immigrants?''
</P>
<P>
   In Hickory, N.C., educators at Catawba Valley Community College
are grappling with many of the challenges posed by the report.
Established in 1960, its mission has expanded broadly with economic
and social changes.
</P>
<P>
   In the heart of one of America's most industrialized corridors,
the community college still teams up with local furniture and
hosiery factories to train employees on the latest technology. The
college also provides basic education to adults who dropped out of
high school years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Struggling to find workers in a robust economy with an
unemployment rate below 3 percent, manufacturers are hiring
increasing numbers of immigrants. They are calling on the college
to teach them to speak English.
</P>
<P>
   Catawba Valley's Hosiery Technology Center recently created a
CD-ROM that uses photos, audio clips and animation to teach English
vocabulary related to hosiery manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   But some manufacturers are reluctant to teach English to
immigrants, including a growing population of Hmongs from Laos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some companies fear that if they teach people how to speak
English better, they will go someplace else,'' said Debbie Saine, a
basic skills recruiter for the college.
</P>
<P>
   Catawba Valley offers a program for single parents and displaced
homemakers who need encouragement and guidance to return to school.
Most of the 200 students enrolled last year were women.
</P>
<P>
   ``The common theme is that they cannot support themselves or
their families without further training,'' said Wanda Horvath, the
college's special programs coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by a federal grant, Catawba Valley offers a program that
encourages women like Hackett to pursue traditionally male jobs.
Men also are encouraged to consider careers such as nursing.
</P>
<P>
   For Hackett, who studied automotive systems technology, pursuing
a male-dominated career hasn't been easy. She has run into slights
because she's a woman.
</P>
<P>
   Still, her new job at Armstrong Ford has brought stability to
her family. She's no longer working under the hood, which allows
her to fix dinner at night without grease under her nails. She's
able to spend more time with her two sons and two daughters,
including 18-year-old Christina, who ran away a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett blamed herself for that, saying she was away too much
while working two jobs
</P>
<P>
   Now Christina is holding down a job as shift leader at McDon-
ald's. Her mother hopes she eventually will enroll in college, but
for now, Hackett said, ``She makes $7 an hour, and I'm real proud
of her.

   Backed by a federal grant, Catawba Valley offers a program that
encourages women like Hackett to pursue traditionally male jobs.
Men also are encouraged to consider careers such as nursing.
</P>
<P>
   For Hackett, who studied automotive systems technology, pursuing
a male-dominated career hasn't been easy. She has run into slights
because she's a woman.
</P>
<P>
   Still, her new job at Armstrong Ford has brought stability to
her family. She's no longer working under the hood, which allows
her to fix dinner at night without grease under her nails. She's
able to spend more time with her two sons and two daughters,
including 18-year-old Christina, who ran away a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett blamed herself for that, saying she was away too much
while working two jobs
</P>
<P>
   Now Christina is holding down a job as shift leader at McDon-
ald's. Her mother hopes she eventually will enroll in college, but
for now, Hackett said, ``She makes $7 an hour, and I'm real proud
of her.''

 &HT;    Tapes: Crew calm until jet vanished
 &HT;    By Randy Kennedy and Matthew L. Wald
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEGGY'S COVE, Nova Scotia _ As grieving families from several
countries began to converge on this tiny fishing village on Friday,
officials looking for the cause of the crash of Swissair Flight 111
on Wednesday said that it appeared that the crew was in control of
the jet and making rational decisions about how to land the
stricken plane until it abruptly disappeared from radar.
</P>
<P>
   The chief Canadian investigator said that aside from the smoky
condition the pilots reported in seeking permission for an
emergency landing, the crew reported no specific problems with the
operation of the jumbo jet, an MD-11 built by McDonnell Douglas in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   The investigator, Vic Gerden, from the Canadian National Safety
Board, said that contrary to earlier reports, the jetliner changed
course only once, when the pilot was told that he should attempt to
land in Halifax rather than in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the plane, carrying 215 passengers and a crew of
14, was about 58 nautical miles from the runway in Halifax. Gerden
said the pilot began to make wide circles to both reduce altitude
and dump fuel as he descended in preparation for a landing.
</P>
<P>
   Gerden added that the crews' communication with Canadian air
traffic controllers was ``professional throughout.'' He said that
the crew twice indicated that they had a serious problem with the
plane, which was only described as smoke in the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   As investigators analyzed the tapes, several relatives of the
victims made solemn journeys to the rocky Nova Scotia coastline.
Peter Gerety, the brother of Pierce Gerety, a U.N. official who was
aboard Flight 111, picked up two rocks there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt like having a memento,'' said Gerety. ``It's such
a beautiful place; that's the irony of it.'' Gerety said he would
keep one of the stones and deliver the other to his brother's
widow.
</P>
<P>
   On several fronts Friday, the recovery and investigation
frustrated both officials and grieving families eager for answers.
</P>
<P>
   To the surprise and frustration of many investigators, a
submarine equipped with sophisticated sonar and other underwater
listening devices caught no whisper from the ``pingers'' attached
to the jet's black boxes _ the flight data recorder and cockpit
voice recorder. As a result, investigators had little to go on
beyond radar tapes and the tapes of the conversations between the
crew and the ground. Investigators were still poring over this
information Friday and said they would release a transcript of the
conversations and a radar map on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In fact searchers have so far found no large pieces of wreckage,
although what has turned up has shown no signs of fire or other
obvious clues. Sgt. Andre Guertin of the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police said the most significant discovery Friday was about 100
mostly intact pieces of luggage.
</P>
<P>
   But other aspects of the investigation began to move forward. In
New York, the FBI joined the Federal Aviation Administration in
examining cargo manifests for the flight to determine whether any
hazardous materials were on board, either declared or undeclared.
The flight did not carry any materials owned by the airline,
investigators said Friday; that is significant, officials said,
because in the crash of a Valuejet DC9 in Florida two years ago,
the cause of a fire on board turned out to be hazardous oxygen
generators in boxes labeled ``comat,'' meaning company materials.
</P>
<P>
   FAA officials also said they were looking closely at six
directives they had issued since 1994 regarding flaws that might
cause smoke or fire on MD-11s. Those are among several orders
issued by the agency for planes under U.S. jurisdiction after
scattered instances of fire or smoke on that type of jet. The
Swissair jet was registered in Switzerland and was not subject to
U.S. orders, but officials said that most European airlines
routinely adopt the FAA directives.
</P>
<P>
   At a military base several miles to the northeast, medical
examiners also joined the investigation, performing toxicology
tests on the victims' remains that may indicate whether passengers
had inhaled smoke or other fumes before the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The medical examiners, working in a makeshift morgue in an
airplane hangar, began a second painstaking day of identifying the
bodies, which are stored in five refrigerated trucks.
</P>
<P>
   But they said late Friday afternoon that they had not been able
to positively identify a single body yet. The examiners also said
they were working to try to identify the bodies primarily using
dental records and other medical information so that they could
spare the families from having to view the bodies, most of which
are not intact.
</P>
<P>
   As searchers and investigators settled in for what they said
would likely be weeks of work, the families of the victims began to
arrive to be nearer to the place where the jet went down. Officials
said they expected as many as 800 relatives and friends, many of
which arrived in Halifax Friday afternoon on Swissair flights from
New York and Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   Several relatives made their way to Peggy's Cove, a fishing
village and tourist haven that is nearest point of land to the
crash site. One man, who did not give his name, arrived in the late
afternoon as the fog grew so thick that the lighthouse at the edge
of the cove became invisible. He slowly made his way around a rocky
inlet near where searchers were loading debris and human remains
into a truck. Before leaving a van, he bent down quickly to the
water, wet his hands and touched them to his lips.

TRANSCRIPTS SHOW JET PREPARED FOR EMERGENCY 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ Transcripts released yesterday of the
final communications between the pilots of doomed Swissair 111 and
Canadian air traffic controllers show calm preparations for an
emergency landing dissolving into calls, apparently from behind
oxygen masks in a smoky cabin, for an immediate touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Swissair 111 heavy is declaring `Pan Pan Pan','' or distress,
one of the pilots told controllers Wednesday night about 70 miles
southwest of Halifax. ``We have smoke in the cockpit, request
deviate immediate right turn to a convenient place, I guess
Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   The controller responded: ``Would you prefer to go into
Halifax?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Affirmative for Swissair 111 ... prefer Halifax from our
position,'' the pilot said.
</P>
<P>
   But about 30 miles from Halifax International Airport, the pilot
told controllers in Moncton, New Brunswick, that he needed more
distance and that he also needed to dump excessive fuel that would
have made a landing at Halifax very risky.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Swissair 111 was given clearance to make a left
turn and is believed to have begun dumping fuel over the ocean at
10,000 feet. The pilots never responded to two authorizations to
dispose of their fuel, and their MD-11 aircraft with 229 passengers
and crew soon began turning in a tight circle that ended with a
plunge into the cold Atlantic on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Ten minutes after the distress call came the last transmission
from the aircraft, as it began heading over St. Margaret's Bay:
``We are declaring an emergency at time zero-one-two-four ... We
are starting to vent now. We have to land immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Six minutes later, the aircraft struck the water off Peggy's
Cove. Everybody aboard was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Although the jet came within 25 miles of the airport before
turning in a broad arc toward the ocean, chief crash investigator
Vic Gerden said the aircraft would have been 30 tons overweight if
it had attempted to touch down while carrying the bulk of the fuel
needed to take it across the Atlantic and on to Zurich.
</P>
<P>
   ``You risk that it would have gone off the end of the runway at
an unknown rate of speed,'' said Gerden, of the Canadian
Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   Any such landing would have risked the plane's landing gear
crashing through its wings or the fuselage breaking up into a
fireball, said a high-ranking official of the US National
Transportation Safety Board, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   As Gerden briefed reporters on the day's events, relatives of
the victims were receiving another briefing from the disaster team.
</P>
<P>
   By late Saturday, one body _ of a French national _ had been
identified at the chapel on a military base near Halifax that is
serving as a collection point for both human remains and aircraft
pieces.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, only small pieces of the jet had been recovered,
although search teams believe they are zeroing in on the aircraft's
transponder, which should bring them closer to the main fuselage
and the flight-data recorder that could hold the key to this crash.
</P>
<P>
   So far, five semi-trailer trucks have been used to store the
personal belongings that are washing up on the beaches and have
been retrieved from the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Family members will be allowed today to begin viewing and
identifying personal items, such as wallets, passports, and
personal papers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite 6-foot rolling seas and 25 m.p.h. winds, the salvage
effort continued Saturday in a 50-mile-long area along the rocky
coast of southeastern Nova Scotia. More than 600 military and
civilian personnel patrolled broad sections of the shore in an
expanding search for remains of the passengers and of Flight 111.
</P>
<P>
   Below the surface of the Atlantic, about 75 Canadian military
divers plunged as deep as 190 feet near the estimated point of
impact to scour the ocean floor for large portions of the MD-11
jet. They were aided by a Canadian submarine, whose sonar was used
to detect any anomalies in the charted ocean bottom that might be
broken pieces of the airliner. Remote-control submersible cameras
also were being used.
</P>
<P>
   Assistance has been offered by the United States, as well as
from other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Sergeant Andre Guertin of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said
the search had been concentrated on a 15-square-kilometer area near
where the aircraft's fuel slick was first discovered.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the largest remnant of the jet to be recovered has been
a 3-by-3-foot fragment. Many of the bodies of the 229 passengers
and crew may still be in the fuselage of the Swissair jet, which
was delivered to the airline by McDonnell-Douglas in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Guertin said that treacherous tides, currents, and winds off
Peggy's Cove have complicated the search, but that ``we will only
stop searching when the possibility of finding every body has been
exhausted.'' Formal identification of human remains had not begun
Saturday, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian investigators plan to reassemble the aircraft at
Shearwater military base near Halifax to find clues into the cause
of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian military and police boats were used Saturday to deliver
wreaths from victims' relatives to the crash site. Because of the
rough seas, the families were not brought out on the open water.
They were, however, allowed to collect samples of water from the
ocean near picturesque Peggy's Cove.
</P>
<P>
   Memorial services are planned today at a church near the village
and also at a cathedral in Halifax. An estimated 800 relatives and
friends of the victims had arrived in Nova Scotia by Saturday.

 &HT;    These days, with steady pay comes malaise
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   American workers have never had it so good. So why do so many
feel so bad?
</P>
<P>
   Despite being materially better off, many working Americans are
disillusioned.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers University and the University of Connecticut weighed in
Friday, the eve of Labor Day weekend, with the latest word from the
work-force front. An overwhelming majority of the 1,001 U.S.
workers surveyed said they are worried about job security and their
children's future in the workplace. They're also pessimistic about
job prospects, anxious about their companies' commitment to them
and looking for better ways to balance their work and personal
life. The survey was conducted during the first two weeks of
August, as Wall Street continued its descent.
</P>
<P>
   Workers everywhere seem uneasy and even combative.
</P>
<P>
   This summer's strike at General Motors Corp. led off a
high-profile series of recent worker-management confrontations at
companies such as AirTran Airlines, Anheuser-Busch, BellSouth and
Bell Atlantic. Just last weekend, pilots at Northwest Airlines
joined the fray by walking out and grounding the nation's No. 4
airline. Even Mickey, Goofy and the Seven Dwarfs are fed up.
Disney's cast of costumed characters at its theme parks, along with
ticket takers, janitors and bus drivers, may strike this fall over
pay and job security.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a deep resentment running in America right now among
the average worker,'' says Gerald Celente of The Trend Research
Institute in New York. Many workers feel locked out of this
feel-good economy _ just as it may be coming to an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm making less money now than I was in 1982. I can't pay my
utility. One car's been repossessed. The other is two weeks past
due,'' said Decatur resident Bill Bowman, a 54-year-old machinist
who makes about $12 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Bowman responded to an Atlanta Journal-Constitution call-in
asking readers whether they feel they are sharing in the nation's
prosperity. While some said they are enjoying economic good times,
other said prosperity has eluded them.
</P>
<P>
   Many white-collar workers, including Anne Marie Sikorski, a
15-year veteran of the advertising marketing field, are rethinking
their jobs, careers and lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel unappreciated at the job,'' Sikorski said. ``It's not
just my current job. It's every job I've ever had.'' Sikorski
recently attended a Saturday morning career conference at Mount
Vernon Baptist Church in North Atlanta. The Crossroads Career
conference drew more than 400 people, mostly middle class and white
collar, underscoring the prevailing angst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anxiety is higher,'' said Brian Ray, an executive headhunter
and one of the organizers of the conference. ``Ten years ago, there
was a little more of the feeling that 'the company will take care
of me' as opposed to, 'Now I need to take care of myself,' and
they're not sure how.'' Jobs and entire industries that don't fit
in the new so-called ``knowledge economy'' _ where people are paid
for their mind more than their muscle _ are being squeezed out.
That has many workers scared and wondering whether they'll be next.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who felt they were immune to being made obsolete in the
workplace _ particularly college graduates _ now realize they're
not immune,'' said Kenneth Deavers, chief economist of the
Employment Policy Foundation, a research group. But the changes
haven't been all bad.
</P>
<P>
   More Americans than ever are working. Even the poorest working
American today is faring better materially than the average
middle-class family of 30 years ago, according to the EPF. ``Take
all the economic numbers and set them aside and look at ownership
of boats, homes, TV sets, cars, and the real standard of living is
higher than it's ever been,'' Deavers said.
</P>
<P>
   This economic prosperity is filled with paradoxes.
</P>
<P>
   Wages: Despite wage improvements in the past few years,
paychecks for most American families are no better than they were
in the 1980s. Median family income was $1,000 less in 1996 than in
1989 for all workers, according to John Schmitt, labor economist
for the Economic Policy Institute, another research group.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it's true the economy is bigger than it's ever been and
we are wealthier than we've ever been as a country, it's not
necessarily the case for the typical family,'' Schmitt said.
``That's because we have a very unequal distribution of wealth and
income in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Wealth: The average chief executive makes more than 130 times
what the average worker earns, according to William M. Mercer Inc.,
a New York-based expert on executive compensation. A Mercer study
of 350 large U.S. firms found that the compensation for the average
chief executive in 1997 totaled nearly $2.4 million, compared with
$21,200 for the average worker.
</P>
<P>
   Work: Jobs are plentiful, but at the same time, more people are
losing their jobs as companies downsize and merge. Those workers
often end up in lower-paying jobs. That's the case for Richard
Wilson of west Cobb County. Wilson has lost two jobs in 10 years
because of reorganizations and is now doing part-time accounting
work, making about a third of what he used to earn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for me to believe a lot of what I read and hear
about the economy. I'm particularly concerned about the fact I hear
the crying need for experienced, mature workers,'' said Wilson, a
former top-level finance executive. ``I understand (the prosperity)
is (good) for a lot of people, but somehow I'm missing that boat.''
</P>
<P>
   The winnowing of workers isn't likely to let up. Nor is the
workload. Seven of the 10 biggest mergers in history took place in
the second quarter of this year. Job cuts this year are 37 percent
ahead of 1997, according to Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas. The
321,217 job cuts announced through July eclipse all of the layoffs
announced in 1990. At the same time, nearly 11 million new jobs
have been created in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   Even as jobs seem to be plentiful, the workload is unrelenting.
Workers are putting in more hours for less money, just to keep up.
The typical married couple with children works 247 more hours _ the
equivalent of six workweeks _ a year than they did nine years ago,
according to the Economic Policy Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street: The stock market in the past two decades has
created lots of millionaires and even a few billionaires. But six
out of every 10 working families don't own stock, according to EPI.
The richest 10 percent of households in the United States have
reaped 85.5 percent of the growth in the market since 1989.
Conversely, the typical middle-class family had nearly 3 percent
less wealth in 1997 than in 1989. Perhaps One of the more puzzling
pieces of this prosperity is our behavior. Despite misgivings about
jobs, we are spending as if this run will never end. We are maxed
out on our credit cards. Personal bankruptcies are at historic
highs. Personal savings are at the lowest level since the middle of
the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't behave as if they were truly anxious about their
future,'' said Deavers at the Economic Policy Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   And that may speak volumes about the devil-may-care attitude
some workers are taking.
</P>
<P>
   Many workers are job-hopping, bailing out or bypassing corporate
America. Career strategists see that as a positive outgrowth in all
of the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Workers are realizing they have to be responsible for their
own career and development, and organizations are pushing that more
and more on them,'' said Bob McDonald, who with business partner
Don Hutcheson founded the Highlands Program, an Atlanta-based
national training and development company.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's much more freedom for those people who want to chart
their own career,'' said career adviser Marilyn Moats Kennedy.
``This is all shaping up to give self-employment a big boost.
...The best and the brightest will end up there.''

NOTRE DAME BEATS MICHIGAN, 36-20  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BEND, Ind. _ There were only two things that could have
soothed the Notre Dame faithful after the most difficult off season
in the school's history: the return to the option offense and an
upset victory against Michigan. One led to another Saturday as
quarterback Jarious Jackson went back in time to dart and pitch
Notre Dame to a 36-20 victory over the fifth-ranked Wolverines.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was it an upset, the capacity crowd of 80,225 watched
the Irish put up the most points a Notre Dame team had ever scored
on a Michigan team in 28 meetings. They saw a defense that had
bent, most of the first half, break the will of the Wolverines with
goal-line stands, blocked field goals and timely sacks.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time a Lloyd Carr-coached team was beaten in
September in 12 tries, and it was the good old option offense that
drove the beating. Autrey Denson, who is closing in on Notre Dame's
career rushing record, carried 23 times for 154 yards, and Jackson
turned the ball upfield 15 times for 60 yards.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of recovered fumbles in the third quarter turned Notre
Dame from a bullied team _ cowed by a defensive unit that returned
nine starters from a national championship team that gave up only
9.5 points a game _ into a nimble unit looking for the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   After trailing by 13-6 at halftime, the Irish mounted a 62-yard
drive that ended with Jim Sanson's third field goal of the
afternoon. On the ensuing kickoff, the sophomore cornerback Brock
Williams separated the ball from the Wolverine tailback Clarence
Williams with a vicious hit that sent the ball bouncing into the
hands of Tony Driver on the Michigan 34-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   It took Jackson, who has waited patiently for three years behind
Ron Powlus, only seven plays to demonstrate why he has been hailed
as the second coming of Tony Rice, the option maestro who last led
the Irish to a national title in 1988. He kept twice, scampering
for gains of 4 and 11 yards. Then on third-and-2, from the 2-yard
line, he executed a perfect play-action fake that froze the
Michigan line, and tossed to tight end Dan O'Leary, who was wide
open in the corner of the end zone. When Sanson kicked the extra
point, Notre Dame was ahead for good, 16-13.
</P>
<P>
   On Michigan's next possession, fullback Ray Jackson fumbled when
hit by Anthony Weaver, the first freshman to start on defense for
Notre Dame since 1983. Linebacker Grant Irons was there to gather
it in at Michigan's 35-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   This time it took Jackson only one play. He dropped straight
back and found Raki Nelson streaking down the sideline and put it
in his hands. Suddenly, 23-13, the Irish were on their way.
</P>
<P>
   It has been an embarrassing off season for Notre Dame, which
lost an age discrimination suit filed by a former coach that made
public details of player abuse and internal squabbling among the
coaching staff. The program also reported itself for violating
National Collegiate Athletic Association rules involving gifts
given to a dozen players by a woman who pleaded guilty to
embezzling $1 million from her employer.
</P>
<P>
   The victory Saturday was sure to lift spirits, but it started
slowly. In an odd first half filled with critical penalties, missed
kicks and tough goal-line defense, it looked like the Irish and the
Wolverines would settle for swapping a pair of field goals.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolverines abandoned their Big Ten-style running game and
went to the air 28 times in the half. The junior quarterback Tom
Brady completed 18 passes for 193 yards _ 8 for 101 yards to Tai
Streets, who continually befuddled the Irish secondary. Three times
Michigan drove inside Notre Dame's 20-yard line, but it still only
had 6 points to show for it. The Wolverines held the ball for 20
minutes of the first half, gained more than 269 yards, and could
not cross the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   But with 2 minutes 59 seconds left in the half, Brady marched
Michigan once more, this time for 72 yards, and then carried the
ball over himself to take his team into the locker room leading
13-7. The touchdown came after A'Jani Sanders, a 5-foot-8-inch
safety, was called for pass interference against the Michigan tight
end Jerame Tuman. Suddenly, a third-and-goal stop was transformed
into four fresh downs from the 2-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish offense never fired under Jackson in the first half.

FOX L.A. AFFILIATE TO FINALLY AIR McGWIRE 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Fox's Los Angeles affiliate, KTTV-Channel 11,
promises to have today's 1 p.m. network coverage of Mark McGwire's
attempt to tie the major league single-season home run record _
unlike what the station did Saturday when McGwire had three shots
at matching it.
</P>
<P>
   Fox Sports, headquartered in Century City, gave its West Coast
affiliates the option of carrying Saturday's St. Louis-Cincinnati
contest as the first part of a TV doubleheader. The regionally
scheduled Dodgers-San Francisco telecast started at 1 p.m., so it
wouldn't have been pre-empted.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving on Labor Day weekend, KTTV management declined
the option; the Fox affiliate in San Francisco did carry the game.
</P>
<P>
   An employee on the KTTV news assignment desk Saturday said the
station received many calls during the 10 a.m.-to-1 p.m. period but
they were not authorized to do anything about changing the
programming.
</P>
<P>
   When McGwire homered in his first at bat to reach 60, KTTV was
in the midst of showing the ``Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'' kids
show. As McGwire struck out the last three at bats in an attempt to
tie Roger Maris' record of 61, the station aired, as previously
scheduled, ``WMAC Masters'' martial arts show; ``Student Bodies,''
a show for teen-agers, and ``Hangin' With Mr. Cooper'' prior to Fox
Sports's own ``In the Zone'' taped baseball kids show.

 &HT;    AirTran, attendants reach accord
 &HT;    By Sophia Lezin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AirTran Airlines and its flight attendants reached a tentative
agreement Saturday afternoon, avoiding last-minute flight
cancellations at Atlanta's second-largest carrier during the busy
Labor Day weekend, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ecstatic,'' said William Green Jr., the Association of
Flight Attendants' local council president for AirTran, in a
statement. ``The flight attendants worked three years to get a
legally binding contract with the company.''
</P>
<P>
   If a settlement had not been reached, the union had threatened a
campaign called CHAOS _ Creating Havoc Around Our System _ in which
members would stage walkouts from selected flights.
</P>
<P>
   The goal was to cause uncertainty among travelers, cost AirTran
business and prod management into a better offer, the union said.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran has about 120 daily departures from Hartsfield
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday afternoon, negotiators for the Association of Flight
Attendants _ to which 500 AirTran flight attendants belong _ and
the airline reached a four-year-agreement that includes pay raises
of 10 percent effective Oct. 31 and annual raises of 4 percent each
year of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the raises, the pact also gives flight attendants
vacation pay, sick pay, merger protection, strong grievance
procedures and other concessions they had requested.
</P>
<P>
   The AFA and AirTran, formerly ValuJet, have been in on-again,
off-again negotiations since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pleased to continue to build an airline without any
distraction,'' said AirTran President and CEO D. Joseph Corr.

MCGWIRE BLASTS NO. 60 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ His swing was sweet. In one spectacular motion, Mark
McGwire gave a sellout crowd of 47,994 fans at Busch Stadium and
millions of fans watching on television something they had been
waiting for.
</P>
<P>
   There never was any doubt about McGwire's 60th home run, which
came in the first inning of Saturday's 7-0 St. Louis Cardinals
victory over Cincinnati. In the 142d game of the season, McGwire
got a 2-and-0 fastball from Cincinnati's Dennis Reyes and drove it
an estimated 381 feet into the lower deck in left field.
</P>
<P>
   With that, McGwire had caught up to another baseball ghost. On
Tuesday, he had hit his 56th and 57th homers to pass Hack Wilson's
National League record, a mark that had stood since 1930. Only Babe
Ruth and Roger Maris stood before him. Saturday, with his 60th,
McGwire matched Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable,'' McGwire said over and over in his
postgame press conference. ``What's happening right now with
myself, Sammy Sosa, and (Ken) Griffey has brought baseball back on
the map. If you want to say it brought America together, it has. So
be it.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire had been shut out on Friday night, going 0 for 3 with a
walk in the Reds' 3-2 win. After the game, he was not available to
the media. Nor did he appear publicly before Saturday's contest. He
wasn't mad at anybody. He was refocusing himself. He apparently
succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   With one out and one on in the first, McGwire stepped to the
plate to thunderous applause. True to their word, the Reds didn't
pitch around the slugger. But Reyes made the mistake of falling
behind with two pitches down and in. His third one was right down
the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Pow!
</P>
<P>
   As McGwire rounded the bases, the fans at Busch Stadium went
crazy. They continued to cheer after McGwire had crossed the plate
and disappeared into the Cardinals dugout. The wanted a curtain
call, and got one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said before if he's going to get me, it would be with my
best pitch,'' said Reyes. ``That's what I threw. When he hit the
ball, I knew it was gone. All I could do was think about getting
the next hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire made three more plate appearances in the game and was
retired each time, twice on strikeouts. One came in the seventh
inning with two men on base and first base open.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought about walking him,'' quipped Cincinnati manager
Jack McKeon, ``but I also thought about all those phone calls on my
voice mail calling me the Heel of America. I thought I could aid
the healing process and do something good for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire said he went about his job Saturday without thinking
about records. He kept to his usual pregame routine, although
neither club took batting practice. Once the game started, he was
patient at the plate, and it paid off.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the count was 2 and 0,'' said McGwire, ``I was just
telling myself to get a good pitch to hit and drive it. He threw a
fastball, middle in. I got it up in the air and out of the
ballpark. That's all there was to it. They came after me. In my
last three at-bats, I had been pitched very well.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire said he used the same bat he had used for his previous
four homers. He will continue to use it until it breaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you know,'' said McGwire, ``60 is a great number and I'm
going to do my best to do whatever I can in the time left before
me. There is pressure upon me every day I take the field.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire knew that Sosa was still on his tail, playing last night
with the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope there is a lot of focus on him because he is doing some
great things, too,'' said McGwire. ``He's having a magical year,
and I'm rooting for him.''

PENN STATE BEATS SOUTHERN MISSISSIPPI, 34-6  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By RON DICKER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STATE COLLEGE, Pa. _ Penn State may get to celebrate Coach Joe
Paterno's 300th victory next week, but No. 299 will probably have a
greater impact on the Nittany Lions' confidence. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Penn State began its 33rd season under Paterno Saturday with
muted expectations and unanswered questions.
</P>
<P>
   Would its defense, which collapsed at the end of last season,
turn around? Could its rushing attack be productive despite losing
Curtis Enis to the National Football League and three other backs
to injury or transfer?
</P>
<P>
   And could a No. 1 quarterback emerge, either the dropback-style
Kevin Thompson or the scrambler Rashard Casey? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For one afternoon, the answers were yes, yes and yes. And the
Nittany Lions, ranked 13th in both the news media and coaches
polls, provided the affirmative against a respected opponent,
cruising to a 34-6 victory over 21st-ranked Southern Mississippi. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Penn State built a 20-0 lead before halftime, allowing the
96,617 fans at Beaver Stadium to concentrate on their suntans and
next week's game against Bowling Green.
</P>
<P>
   That game which should be a coronation for Paterno. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The junior Cordell Mitchell emerged from his understudy's role
to rush for 99 yards on 16 carries. Fullback Omar Easy had 63 yards
and Eric McCoo added 51 yards on 4 carries as the Lions rolled up
255 yards rushing. Thompson showed more poise in Paterno's platoon
setup at quarterback, completing 10 of 15 passes for 140 yards and
a touchdown. Casey completed 3 of 6 for 28 yards. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Golden Eagles, who have won the Conference USA title two
straight years, were able to move through the air. Quarterback Lee
Roberts connected on 27 passes for 289 yards, breaking Brett
Favre's school record for completions, and receiver Sherrod Gideon
hauled in a school-record 13 receptions for 176 yards. But Southern
Miss stumbled to a miserable 9 yards rushing on 21 attempts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At halftime, the Nittany Lions had held the Golden Eagles to
minus-18 yards rushing while amassing 264 total yards on offense
themselves. Midway through the second quarter, Mitchell had already
rushed for 85 yards. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thompson threw just one pass on Penn State's first scoring
drive, an 8-yarder to Corey Jones that put the Lions at the
Southern Miss 10. Mitchell pushed the Lions to the 1 on two carries
and fullback Mike Cerimele plowed in for the touchdown. After a
29-yard field goal by Travis Forney, Easy ran in from the 5 to give
Penn State a 17-0 lead in the second quarter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Early in the second half, Eddie Shaw of Southern Miss muffed Pat
Pidgeon's punt and Penn State's Mack Morrison recovered the ball to
set up Joe Nastasi's leaping 12-yard touchdown reception from
Thompson to make it 27-0. &QL;

LUCKY ROBERTO WINS THE HOPEFUL STAKES  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ For 94 years at Saratoga, they have
called it the Hopeful because it was a career-building stakes for
2-year-olds whose owners were ``hopeful they had a colt of classic
capabilities.'' And it was won by special colts named Man o' War
and Secretariat and, last year, Favorite Trick, later voted Horse
of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   The clear favorite Saturday to win this year's Hopeful was the
trainer D. Wayne Lukas, who had already won it three times in this
decade and who had entered two of his star juveniles, Time Bandit
and Tactical Cat. But his hopes were shot down by a 9-1 outsider
named Lucky Roberto, who ran fifth behind Tactical Cat in the
Sanford last month and second behind Time Bandit in the Tremont
four weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Lucky Roberto came from a stalking third place and
sprinted past Tactical Cat to take the lead in the homestretch. At
the finish, he had one length on Tactical Cat, who had three on
Time Bandit. He ran the seven furlongs in 1:23 4/5 and paid $20.20
for a $2 bet to win.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky Roberto, a New York-bred colt owned by J. Mack Robinson
and trained by Frank Alexander, will still have to face the No. 1
prodigy in the Lukas barn, Yes It's True, and they most likely will
meet in the Belmont Futurity on Sept. 20. But for now, at least,
Lucky Roberto has outrun two of the Lukas herd in one race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, there are no real excuses,'' Lukas said. ``The
winner ran well and gave a career best. Yes It's True is obviously
our strong one. We'll probably split these two up, but we have some
options.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbie Davis rode Lucky Roberto in place of Mike Smith, who won
the Travers on Coronado's Quest one week ago but fractured two
vertebrae in a spill two days later and is out for three or four
months. Davis dedicated his ride aboard Lucky Roberto to Smith, and
added: ``The minute I stepped on this colt, I knew it would be
tough to beat him.''
</P>
<P>
   In the race before the Hopeful, they ran one of the rare rain
makeups at Saratoga: the Saranac Handicap, which was one of two
races canceled because of a violent thunderstorm Wednesday. Parade
Ground, the favorite to win his third straight on the turf after a
successful career on the dirt, was trapped on the rail and finished
second by four lengths to Crowd Pleaser, who certainly lived up to
his name when he paid $53.50 for a $2 bet to win.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Sheppard was the trainer and Jean-Luc Samyn the rider,
but all of the running was done by Crowd Pleaser, a son of A.P.
Indy, who won his second straight at Saratoga and the fifth in 11
starts in his career.

HIS ARE FIGHTING WORDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;   &UR;  &LR; Angel Manfredy doesn't talk like one.
</P>
<P>
   The World Boxing Union super featherweight champion may be the
least-known dangerous fighter in all Christendom, a point he
intends to make to one John Brown Sept. 22 but would rather be
hammering home to people like Prince Naseem Hamed or World Boxing
Council 130-pound champion Genaro Hernandez, the latter generally
considered the most skilled boxer in the world today at that
weight.
</P>
<P>
   Manfredy would even gladly go up to 135 pounds and take on
International Boxing Federation champion Shane Mosley, who is
widely assumed to be the best lightweight around at the moment as
well.
</P>
<P>
   But a rematch with Arturo Gatti, whom he slapped half silly a
few months back in a stunningly proficient performance, holds no
interest to Manfredy despite the money it would bring, because this
Angel wants to be faced only with devilish matches when he goes to
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would I fight Gatti again?'' Manfredy said last week.
``I'm the one who beat him in his prime. Ivan Robinson (who
recently won a split decision from Gatti in a slugfest that is
likely to be 1998's fight of the year) just got the leftovers. He
didn't beat the real Gatti.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gatti I fought was sharp and strong. Everyone was ducking
him. He was everything he was supposed to be, and I destroyed him
and made it look easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I chased Gatti for two years and got 20 percent of what he
got, which is nothing. I wanted to take his soul, to show the world
these superstars ain't nothing. I did it, but it slowed down my
career. After that, everyone wanted big money to fight me, so I got
to go with the flow. I'm not going to fight once a year so people
forget about me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manfredy-Hernandez is the fight at 130 pounds because it looks
like the Prince is ducking everybody. The biggest money fight we
can make is me and the Prince, but HBO is protecting him. Not only
HBO, but his people.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was supposed to fight Kennedy McKinney, and now he's
fighting some Pocket Rocket (former bantamweight champion Wayne
McCullough on Oct. 31) who can't break an egg. Come on. If you
can't punch, what you going to do with the Prince? Catch him with
your little punches? Me and the Prince is the fight about who's
really the best out there.''
</P>
<P>
   These statements came immediately after the words, ``Good
morning,'' so if you get the idea that Angel likes to talk, you'd
be as accurate as his punches. But unlike many of his fellow
practioners of the Sweet Science, Manfredy also likes to fight. It
is something he's been doing in and out of the ring all his life,
and for a time that was a problem because what he was fighting
outside were drink, drugs, and the streets, three things more
lethal than a boxer's fists.
</P>
<P>
   But after nearly killing himself in the last of about a dozen
car accidents, Manfredy found God. Or God found him. Although that
hasn't made an angel out of Angel, it has certainly helped him on
the nights when he is paid to box.
</P>
<P>
   That is why his record has improved to 24-2-1 after two early
losses attributable to his lifestyle more than his boxing style.
The memory of those losses has begun to fade, replaced by one
glorious night of destruction against Gatti. Now that he has both
that buffed record and an obscure portion of the 130-pound title,
all he wants is money _ which makes him no different from most
boxers today _ and the chance to fight the very best opponents _
which makes him different from nearly all boxers today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could fight all the champions out there, but they
don't want to fight,'' Manfredy said. ``I want to be in the Hall of
Fame. That's my goal. That's my dream. That's what I want, so I'll
keep on calling out the fighters I want, like the Prince.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a heavyweight in a lightweight's body. That's what I
bring. You see all these heavyweights paid big money and they ain't
doing nothing no more. It's the lightweights and the featherweights
who are making the noise. We're the ones who bring the action.''
</P>
<P>
   Few bring more than Manfredy, who will make his first appearance
in Madison Square Garden when he defends his title against Brown
(18-4, 9 KO's) in a fight that may not last long. Such a fight is
important only if Manfredy doesn't win it, a fact he well
understands. So while he cannot look past Brown, what this Angel
craves is a night in hell with someone like Hamed or Hernandez, a
night when people will say he cannot win the way they said it the
night he changed Arturo Gatti forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hamed is making good money,'' Manfredy said of HBO's $12
million poster boy for lighter weights and sizzling entrances. ``I
take my hat off to him. The boxing world can't see what he's doing.
He's blinding the boxing world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the fighters, I don't think. It's the people who
handle the fighters. They don't want to let them go if they can
make a lot of money off of Joe Blow. But my whole life is boxing.
People don't understand how much I love boxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't know how it feels. The glory, I love it. I am the
golden boy of the lightweights. I bring the show, the fight, the
blood, the knockouts. Not too many do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Not enough do. In boxing, like in life, there just aren't enough
Angels to go around.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The  &UR; Mike Tyson  &LR; soap opera continued last week when his wife's
car was rear-ended outside Washington by a 53-year-old man whose
car was also rear-ended, knocking it into hers. Unfortunately for
all involved, Tyson was a passenger in his wife's car, and he
leaped out and allegedly punched one man in the lip and kicked the
other driver in the groin. What a surprise that his new
``advisor,''  &UR; Shelly Finkel &LR; , &UR;  &LR; within hours was claiming that Tyson
had been seeing a psychiatrist to work on ``anger management.''
Angry about what? Being a fool? Tyson's act gets older and more
boring every day. He is no longer an athlete; he is a sideshow.
He's the bearded lady at the circus, one of the midgets in a
wrestling ring. Most of all, he has become a sad joke. First his
new trainer,  &UR; Jesse Reid &LR; , &UR;  &LR; walked out on him last week, calling
him ``an angry man''; then he is charged with assault following a
fender-bender. That doesn't sound like a well-balanced guy, which
will be the portrayal he'll try to give at his Sept. 19 license
hearing in Las Vegas. But, then, maybe regaining his license is not
his plan. Tyson sounds like a desperate guy looking for a way out
of boxing _ a way out that he can later blame on someone else.
Sound familiar? By the way, isn't it funny how the closer Tyson
comes to actually boxing again, the more trouble he seems to get
into? ... The Manfredy fight is part of TNT's first foray into
televised professional boxing. On the same card will be Mosley
(28-0) defending his title against No. 1 contender  &UR; Eduardo Morales
 &LR; (26-0) and the return to New York of heavyweight  &UR; Shannon Briggs
 &LR; (30-2-1) for a bout against  &UR; Arthur Weathers  &LR; (23-11-1). The
well-traveled  &UR; Louis Monaco  &LR; brings his 7-14-2 record into the
Theatre at Madison Square Garden that night to test  &UR; Corey Sanders
 &LR; (16-6). Sanders is the kid who sliced up  &UR; Andrew Golota  &LR; in July
... Las Vegas police Lt.  &UR; Tom Monahan  &LR; had an interesting
description of the damage former heavyweight champion  &UR; Michael
Dokes  &LR; allegedly did to his fiancee Monday while beating and
sexually assaulting her. ``I've never seen anybody walk out of the
ring after fighting Michael Dokes that looked this bad,'' Monahan
said. Monahan said the woman's face was unrecogniz-able from her
driver's license ... Some have criticized referee  &UR; Mills Lane  &LR; for
breaking up  &UR; Bernard Hopkins  &LR; and  &UR; Robert Allen  &LR; so physically last
weekend that Hopkins fell out of the ring and hurt his ankle badly
enough that the fight was stopped and he will not be available for
a proposed October match on HBO. I didn't see it that way. Both
guys were holding on to each other from the first round like two
men buffeted by Hurricane Harry. They repeatedly refused to break
when ordered, and did so only reluctantly when Lane physically
intervened. When Lane saw Allen holding Hopkins in a headlock and
tried to break them, he shoved the fighters hard after the
challenger refused to unhand the champion. What resulted was both
fighters staggering back off balance, leading to Hopkins's foot
slipping off the ring apron. He tumbled backward out of the ring,
injuring himself. That was unfortunate, but the IBF middleweight
champion asked for what happened, and so did Allen. Meanwhile, poor
Lane now has been involved in more bizarre ring occurrences than
anyone should have to submit to, including Fan Man crashing into
the outdoor ring at Caesars Palace during a  &UR; Riddick Bowe &LR; - &UR; Evander
Holyfield &LR;  bout,  &UR; Oliver McCall  &LR; having a mental breakdown,
dissolving into tears, and refusing to fight back against  &UR; Lennox
Lewis &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and Tyson's ear-biting attack on Holyfield. No wonder Lane
is dabbling in a TV career ... Speaking of Lewis, last week he
again implied that Holyfield was ducking him and Tyson was a hollow
shell of the fighter he used to be. ``Basically, he showed he
didn't want to fight me,'' Lewis said of Holyfield's insistence on
first $20 million and then $25 million after the $20 million was
finally delivered. ``If he was serious, we could have sorted out
the money. He's fearful because he knows he can be beat. His two
lackluster performances against Tyson proved nothing except that
Tyson is over the hill and plateaued out. That's what happens when
a man spends time in incarceration.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Talk that 140-pound champion  &UR; Vince Phillips  &LR; will be fighting
again soon may be overstatement. Word is he's presently weighing
170 and will be hard-pressed to be ready for a real fight before
the end of the year ... IBF welterweight champion  &UR; Felix Trinidad
 &LR; has been penciled in for a Dec. 12 date on HBO vs.  &UR; Pernell
Whitaker  &LR; if (a) Trinidad gets out of his promotional contract with
 &UR; Don King  &LR; and (b) Whitaker can stay straight ... There had been
talk of Robinson fighting Mosley or Manfredy, but Robinson has
already been offered a rematch with Gatti Nov. 14 that will pay him
a lot more money and offer less risk. Robinson received only
$75,000 for the first fight and will make considerably more for a
rematch that could spell the end of Gatti's days as a big-money
fighter if he loses for a third straight time. Despite those
losses, no one can argue Gatti's fan appeal even now. The
Gatti-Robinson fight beat both ``Saturday Night Live'' and the new
 &UR; Howard Stern  &LR; show in its time slot ... Here's an example of how
nuts things can get in boxing. When  &UR; Roy Jones  &LR; refused to defend
the WBC light heavyweight title against then-No. 1 contender
 &UR; Michael Nunn  &LR; early this year, the title was declared vacant and
Nunn fought  &UR; Gianfranco Rocchigiani  &LR; to fill it. When Rocchigiani
won, he was declared ``interim champion'' by the WBC and assumed
the interim meant until someone like Jones beat him. Then Jones
defeated former two-time world champion  &UR; Virgil Hill  &LR; in April and
the same WBC handed him back the title, declaring Rocchigiani
``champion in recess'' even though no one had taken him to school.
Now Jones is trying to negotiate a deal with Rocchigiani, who the
WBC now says is the mandatory challenger, but Rocchigiani's people
insist their guy should get close to a 50-50 split because he's the
real WBC champion. Jones, meanwhile, says everyone knows who the
light heavyweight champion is, and it's him. One negotiator for
Rocchigiani made a good argument against that, though. He didn't
try to use ratings sheets or TV rating sheets or anyone's opinion.
He produced cancelled checks made out to the WBC covering the
sanction fee for the ``title'' fight with Nunn and the fee the WBC
charged Rocchigiani for delivery of his world champion's belt. If
he's not a champion, how'd he get the belt? And why'd he have to
pay for it? Now it appears Jones may end up fighting  &UR; Otis
Grant &LR; , &UR;  &LR; possibly in Montreal, on a Nov. 14 card along with the
Gatti-Robinson rematch ... WBC super middleweight champion  &UR; Keith
Mullings  &LR; has been offered an HBO ``Boxing After Dark'' date vs.
 &UR; Bronko McKart &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and Mullings is mulling the offer. If he
declines, BAD could go with  &UR; Vuyani Bungu  &LR; vs.  &UR; Danny Romero &LR; . If
the latter comes off, it would be another sign that Romero- &UR; Johnny
Tapia  &LR; is not about to happen because Romero would be fighting at
122 pounds while Tapia still reigns at 115 pounds ... Summer was a
busy time for heavyweight hopeful  &UR; Michael Grant &LR; . Grant was
married Aug. 7, with Holyfield and trainers  &UR; Don Turner  &LR; and  &UR; Tommy
Brooks  &LR; serving as ushers. Then he had to pull out of a Sept. 26
date with  &UR; Ahmad Abdin  &LR; because of a bout with food poisoning. The
fact he has an outside (but very unlikely) shot at Lewis before the
end of the year might have had something to do with that ``food
poisoning.'' ... Boxing has done a unique thing even by its own
sometimes questionable standards. It has scheduled back-to-back
mismatches, with  &UR; Oscar De La Hoya  &LR; fighting washed up  &UR; Julio Cesar
Chavez  &LR; on Sept. 18 and Holyfield defending the heavyweight title
vs. No. 1 pretender  &UR; Vaughn Bean  &LR; Sept. 19, which led New York
Daily News boxing maven  &UR; Michael Katz  &LR; to comment: ``Watch
Holyfield-Bean. The mismatch you haven't seen is always better than
the mismatch you've already seen.'' So who's fighting Sept. 20?
Lennox Lewis vs.  &UR; Joe Louis &LR; ? ...  &UR; Vernon Forrest  &LR; (25-0, 20 KOs)
won the North American Boxing Federation welterweight title
recently with an 11th-round stoppage of  &UR; Adrian Stone &LR;  ... Word is
 &UR; Andrei Pastriev  &LR; now will fight  &UR; Jose Luis Lopez  &LR; for the vacant
World Boxing Association welterweight title. Lopez twice dropped
 &UR; Ike Quartey  &LR; in a fight that was judged a draw. To lure Lewis to
the Mohegan Sun Sept. 26 to defend the WBC heavyweight title, the
Connecticut casino will erect a 5,000-seat tent to house the event.
Obviously, Lewis is the draw, but the best fight on the card may
well between  &UR; David Tua  &LR; (31-1, 26 KOs) and  &UR; Hasim Rahman &LR; . Rahman
holds both the US Boxing Association and IBF Intercontinental
heavyweight titles, and will risk both against Tua. Offcials at
Mohegan Sun are elated at landing the Lewis- &UR; Zeljko Mavrovic  &LR; bout
and believe as soon as they can build their proposed 10,000-seat
arena, they can become a player in boxing's casino big time.

SPRY ELWAY READY TO GO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOVE VALLEY, Colo. _ John Elway walked off the practice field
just before noon. The sun was gloriously warm, a perfect late
summer's day on the Front Range of the Rockies, and the routine was
just about to begin. Elway would speak with the media.
</P>
<P>
   Elway is now at that age _ 38, to be precise _ and station in
his pro football life when he practices when he wishes and talks to
the media on his terms. Virtually no one-on-one interviews, just
this one session a week in which Elway answers questions for
perhaps five minutes, sometimes less.
</P>
<P>
   The questions are scattershot. Each reporter has his or her own
needs. Elway talks, jumping from this question to that, doing his
duty. One Denver TV station wants to know whom Elway likes in the
monstrous Colorado-Colorado State game that was played last night
at Mile High Stadium, another wants to know why the Denver Broncos
always beat the Patriots, a third asks about New England's
linebackers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Patriots are a good football team and we're going to have
to go out and play well; the past has nothing to do with it,''
Elways says. ``Opening Day is so important because you can really
get behind the 8-ball in a hurry. Especially when you've got
Opening Day at home and you've got to win it, I always feel more
pressure on Opening Day than almost any other game.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben Coates or Shannon Sharpe? Each questioner is following that
story, and Elway cooperates: ``Shannon is a guy we can use on third
down. Both are great receivers. Ben is a little bit bigger but I
think Shannon is a little bit faster, but the bottom line for Drew
(Bledsoe) is that Ben is his go-to guy and Shannon's the same with
me. They're great guys to have because if you can't outsize them,
Shannon can outquick them and the same, vice versa, with Ben. The
fact that they try and come with a DB, but Ben's a lot stronger
with them.''
</P>
<P>
   A scattershot answer, too.
</P>
<P>
   The most famous athletes in America all can say many words
without saying anything _ it's a matter of practice, if not
survival _ but Elway seldom has been like that. His very rambling
answer to the Sharpe-Coates question suggested his mind was
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   And then came The Question.
</P>
<P>
   ``John, how's Janet doing?''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's doing better,'' came flying from Elway's mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting out of the hospital today, or was it yesterday?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, today.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was imagined, maybe not, but there seemed a slight
crack in Elway's voice.
</P>
<P>
   Changing times
</P>
<P>
   John Elway said he has already forgotten the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that stuff is behind us, and really the only time it gets
brought up is when you guys ask about it,'' said Elway. ``Other
than that, we don't really do much talking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Super Bowl may be a memory, but even with the season opening
Monday night against New England, football itself can seem distant
in comparison to Elway's personal worries.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if it has been difficult to focus on football, Elway said,
``Yeah. It's always tough when you have things going on the other
fronts that are more important than ... this. It's tough to focus
on things that are less important.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no way to overstate what the Broncos mean to Denver,
especially now that Denver has won the Super Bowl, nor is there any
way to overstate John Elway's place in these Rocky Mountains _ he
is higher than any of them _ or that of his wife, Janet, who is
regularly referred to on Denver TV as ``the First Lady of Denver.''
</P>
<P>
   But a month ago, Elway brought his 37-year-old wife to the Mayo
Clinic in Rochester, Minn., where her colon was removed. After
returning home, Janet Elway was brought to a Denver hospital
because of complications from the surgery and remained there for at
least a week before going home last Thursday. Few details about the
surgery or the complications are known and John Elway,
understandably, is not pressed about them.
</P>
<P>
   Life seldom can be X'd-and-O'd on a blackboard. Just a few
months ago, John Elway had finally made up his mind that he would
not retire with his Super Bowl triumph but would return for one
more season. In football terms, it made sense because Terrell Davis
is such a force and opposing teams would first and foremost have to
stop Davis and the Denver running game, so Elway most likely would
not be battered and bloodied much.
</P>
<P>
   It is understood in Denver that Elway also returned as a favor
to Pat Bowlen, the Broncos' owner, who is trying to have the public
pay for much of the costs of a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Voters will decide in November whether to extend the sales tax
that paid for the construction of Coors Field to cover 74 percent
of the costs of the new football stadium. If Elway were retired,
and if Bubby Brister were the Denver quarterback, and if the
Broncos were 4-4, voters just might be a bit more reluctant to foot
the bill. If Elway and the Broncos are again flying high in
November, passage might be more likely.
</P>
<P>
   So, until a month ago, all seemed fine. But events that occurred
within a few days of each other in early August made this a most
traumatic summer for Elway.
</P>
<P>
   First, it was his wife's operation, the effect of it on the
Elways' four children (three daughters and one son, ages 7 to 12),
and then Elway's trip to Sturgis, S.D., and an annual bikers'
reunion where he tried persuade his old pal, Gary Zimmerman, to
return to the Broncos and play left tackle again. The future Hall
of Famer seemingly was ready to return but then changed his mind
and decided to remain retired.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he might have decided to retire himself if he knew what
was going to happen, Elway said, ``Ahhh, no. I'm just ... you know
... the situation was always tough, but when it came along, it
allowed me the time to do both, to spend time with her and it being
in the preseason ... ahh ... who knows what would have happened if
it had been during the regular season? Ah, no, there's nothing
that's going to come up to question me playing again.''
</P>
<P>
   As sharp as ever
</P>
<P>
   ``They had talked in the offseason, John and Zim, sort of like
if John was coming back, so was Gary,'' said Brister, Elway's
backup. ``It was sort of like a package deal.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Elway announced that he was coming back, similar words
were not forthcoming from Zimmerman. So Elway headed off to Sturgis
after leaving his wife at the Mayo Clinic and spent time amid
thousands of bikers, Hell's Angels vrooming and zooming the entire
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Zim came back, it would not only help our line and give us
more depth,'' said Brister, ``but Zim was also John's pal. They had
been together so long, and they sort of had that little pact, if
one came back, they both came back.''
</P>
<P>
   But Zimmerman did not come back to the Broncos. So Elway's heart
was heavy returning from the trip. Brister thought Elway had second
thoughts about his decision to play one more year.
</P>
<P>
   ``John's not really affected emotionally where people can see,''
said Brister, ``and he might keep it under wraps or whatever, but I
think he felt at the time that if he was coming back, Zim was
coming back. It was a given.''
</P>
<P>
   But, in Brister's mind, Elway ``was probably bothered by Zim's
decision, but it was cut-and-dried. It had to be. That's because
John was more worried about Janet.''
</P>
<P>
   Shoulders shrug when an outsider asks around the Broncos locker
room or among the media for a close friend of Elway's to talk to on
the team. ``Talk to the other QBs'' is a reply heard more than
once.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Elway has outlasted many of his friends on the
Broncos. He is still playing while many of his friends over the
years have retired and now are coaching or taking on other careers
far removed from football.
</P>
<P>
   But Brister _ one of ``the other QBs'' _ roomed with Elway at
camp in Greeley, Colo., and will room with Elway when Denver is on
the road and has been close enough to Elway to see how this
traumatic summer has affected the legend.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, no doubts about Elway The Quarterback, Brister was quick to
offer. Just last Thursday, for instance, when Denver was putting in
its final touches for its game plan for Monday night's game,
Brister couldn't help but notice Elway's demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   ``John's still sharp as a tack,'' said Brister. ``We were
putting in some plays for the Patriots and we had some audibles and
I guess John went home and studied them (Thursday) night and came
to our meeting (Friday morning) and John talked to the coaches
about how there would be a better way to do this particular
audible.
</P>
<P>
   ``So they changed it and the coaches started evaluating the play
and they finally decided John was right. Whether it was his
intuition or whatever, John saw that he could do something better.
He's still as sharp as he ever was.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Elway's body, Brister said, ``I don't see a 38-year-old
body. He's been beat up a lot over the years, he's had a lot of
surgeries and his knees bother him some, but I still don't see a
38-year-old body.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Brister was into it, saying, ``I see a guy who comes out
here every day, has fun and he can still outthrow most everybody in
the league. Plus, he's probably smarter than anybody in the
league.''
</P>
<P>
   Brister told of how Elway would be gone two or three days at a
time at training camp to be with his wife ``and he'd come back and
he'd be 8 out of 11 in practice the next day. I know a quarterback
like myself, and most of the rest of the guys in the league, and
you take two or three days off and you'd be rusty as hell when you
came back. But not John. He hits 9 of 11.''
</P>
<P>
   The cliche is just as true in football as it is in basketball,
baseball, or hockey: The legs go first. But even here Brister
countered that Elway _ while clearly not as mobile as he was 10
years ago _ still has legs, ``because he tucked the ball under his
arm in that game we had here at Mile High just a couple of weeks
ago (against Green Bay), turned the corner and picked up 8 or 9
yards. I'd say John's legs are still here.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, said Brister, Elway has Davis. And Davis makes
Elway healthier and happier and prolongs his football life.
</P>
<P>
   ``John doesn't get beat up the way he used to several years ago
because of the way we run the ball,'' said Brister. ``I'm sure
that's why John feels as good as he does right now, because the
last couple of years he hasn't been beat up as much. And you know
what?''
</P>
<P>
   What?
</P>
<P>
   ``The type of system we're in, with Terrell running, and the way
John keeps himself in condition, in the offseason lifting weights
and all, I see John playing until he's 40.''
</P>
<P>
   40?
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh-huh. 40.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressure persists
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only my personal opinion,'' Brister said, and then added
again for emphasis, ``Now this is only opinion and it's not
something John said, but I was his roommate.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think John had some doubts in his mind then whether he
should have come back or not,'' said Brister. ``I mean, during that
time when Janet was in the hospital and Zim wasn't coming back,
back at that time when all this was happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all that was tough on him,'' said Brister. ``Having to
leave and stuff and worrying about Janet and then it sort of hit
home that Zim wasn't coming back. John was missing a lot of
practice then and I think he was having those doubts.''
</P>
<P>
   If he had not decided to return to football, Elway could have
been with his wife in her time of need. And with Zimmerman gone,
the Broncos' offensive line was flipped topsy-turvy, Tony Jones
moving from right tackle to left, and veteran Harry Swayne, a
backup at left tackle, moving to right tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now that Janet's doing better, John's happy to be here
because he's such a competitor,'' Brister went on. ``Him not being
here this year when he can still run and throw and still be one of
the best quarterbacks in football would have hurt him and, of
course, would have hurt the team, because, John can still do it.''
</P>
<P>
   It it estimated that Elway has made more than $100 million from
football, his car dealerships that were sold last season to Wayne
Huizenga, and other business interests. Some believe that Elway
will enter Colorado politics once his football career is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got no second thoughts (about coming back),'' Elway said.
``I'm really looking forward to playing this year and where we go
from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, football is no release from the worries at home, Elway
said, ``because of the stuff that we (quarterbacks) have to do, the
stuff mentally that we have to know. We're under a lot of pressure
mentally to do a lot of different things, so it's tough to relax.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Elway was asked if he felt his age, if he felt like a
38-year-old playing a position that so few 38-year-olds have been
able to play well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' replied Elway. ``You don't really feel a lot
different from 28 to 38 except there are things that you can and
can't do, especially physically. But mentally, I'm better off than
when I was 28.''
</P>
<P>
   Elways then added that he was saying to a few teammates just the
day before ``that it'd be nice if I can feel the way I feel right
now the rest of the season. But, ah, I know it's downhill from
here.''
</P>
<P>
   And ``here'' _ mentally, at least _ is not as high as the Rocky
Mountains that could be seen over John Elway's shoulders.

SADLY, HE'S A WILD THING OF THE PAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Farewell, big Al. We hardly knew ye.
</P>
<P>
   Some big names have been hanging up the skates this offseason,
most notably Mike Gartner and Kevin Lowe. Both had stellar careers
and were classy, intelligent ambassadors for the sport. But another
veteran whose career appears over will be missed in a far different
way. Defenseman Al Iafrate announced last week that his chronic
knee injuries will prevent him from honoring the contract he signed
in July with the Carolina Hurricanes. Back and knee operations have
plagued Iafrate's last few years; he's spent more time in
rehabilitation centers than the therapists who work there. The man
nicknamed ``Wild Thing'' is saying goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   One of the sad aspects of sports in the '90s _ with more written
about money, contract disputes, and legal troubles than the games
themselves _ is that there are very few characters anymore. The
Bruins of the 1970s were full of colorful personalities who
participated in some outrageous antics. Iafrate was a throwback to
the old days. He smoked, lighting his cigarettes with the blowtorch
players use to finish their sticks. He was a Harley Davidson
devotee and had a rock 'n' roll radio show when he played in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   On the ice, Iafrate was a ferocious presence with a slapper that
could reach 105 miles per hour. In his brief, troubled tenure with
the Bruins, Iafrate played 12 regular-season games and 13 playoff
games in 1993-94. His postseason performance against the Montreal
Canadiens was mammoth, giving the fans a taste of the Iafrate of
old. He didn't play the next two seasons because of injuries. In
the past two seasons with San Jose, Iafrate appeared to be playing
on borrowed time and was limited to a total of 59 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al is devastated,'' said Rick Curran, Iafrate's agent. ``You
can't even imagine how much time and effort he's put into his
rehabilitation over the last three to five years. He's leaving the
door open, and if there's anybody who can walk through that door,
it's Al.''
</P>
<P>
   At 32 and with his injury history, it seems highly unlikely that
Iafrate, who faces yet another knee surgery, can go through all the
necessary rehabilitation again with no guarantee he can resume his
career. It was painful to watch him go through it for two years in
Boston. As Cam Neely and other athletes with chronic injuries have
experienced, there is no lonelier place than the trainer's room
when everyone else is out on the ice. For a time, Iafrate was
bigger than life, a personality who put the ``free'' in ``free
spirit.'' The fans and the league are poorer for no longer having
him around.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother told me she didn't want me to play football,''
Iafrate told me not long ago. ``She was afraid I'd get hurt.
Ironic, huh?''
</P>
<P>
   Ironic indeed.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   It was a big summer for former Bruin  &UR; Rick Tocchet &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who
recently tied the knot in Scottsdale, Ariz. After some rough times
because of injuries, Tocchet was back to form with the Coyotes last
season, scoring 26 goals in 68 games. In the playoffs, Tocchet
scored a team-leading six goals and had eight points in six games.
He has been a leader on every team he's played for and has asserted
those skills this summer, calling for the underachieving Coyotes to
pick it up. ``I think everybody should be ticked off,'' said
Tocchet, referring to the team's first-round punchout in the
playoffs. ``For some reason, this organization thought it was OK to
mess around for three months, then make a push in the last two,
three months. It doesn't work that way. I believe this team really
has to have a good start in October. None of this .500-at-Christmas
stuff.'' Phoenix has the talent to go farther than it has, but the
real question mark revolves around the mess that is the  &UR; Keith
Tkachuk  &LR; contract situation. Tkachuk is a good kid, always has
been, but seems misguided in his demands this time. The backlash
when and if this situation is resolved has the potential to be
brutal. The proper thing for the team to do would be to give the
captaincy to another player, specifically Tocchet. It would take
some of the pressure off Tkachuk and would ensure the club's
leadership would be in good hands. In this writer's opinion, both
sides have handled the Tkachuk dispute dreadfully. Tkachuk should
either honor his contracts or stop signing them, and the team
shouldn't have opened this renegotiation Pandora's box unless it
was prepared to follow through. This nonsense serves no one well
... Is there any more baffling situation than that of  &UR; Pavel Bure
 &LR; in Vancouver? Bure has demanded out and GM  &UR; Brian Burke  &LR; said
he'll let Bure sit out the year in a suspension (the player is due
to make $8 million US this season) if he can't work a proper deal
for the Russian Rocket. Bure won't publicly discuss his reasons for
wanting to be traded after seven seasons with the Canucks. His
agent,  &UR; Mike Gillis &LR; , said if the reasons are made public, they
``are going to do nothing but create ill will toward a bunch of
different people. I don't think (an explanation) is advisable, good
business, or necessary. I don't know why people can't understand
that.'' With all due respect to Gillis, given the facts, why would
anyone understand it? Bure is the one who is creating all kinds of
ill will among the people who have paid his generous salary all
these years. Maybe his reasons are legitimate, but if he has a
problem and wants out, Bure should take responsibility for the
reasons he wants to leave and be honest about them. He is coming
across as yet another whiny, spoiled athlete, which the public has
been fed a steady diet of in other sports, and blames the media for
the friction he has created ... There's quite a row going on
between Florida and Toronto regarding the deal nearly struck
between the clubs. It appeared a lock that goalie  &UR; Felix Potvin
 &LR; and defensive prospect  &UR; Jeff Ware  &LR; would head to Florida for
forward  &UR; Rob Niedermayer  &LR; and defenseman  &UR; Rhett Warrener &LR; . However,
what hung up the deal was that the Leafs wanted Niedermayer, who
has a history of concussions, to undergo an exam to determine if he
was fit to play. Panthers general manager  &UR; Bryan Murray  &LR; believes
that Niedermayer, who doesn't want to leave South Florida, undercut
the deal by saying his post-concussion symptoms flared up over the
summer. Murray is outraged at leaks out of Toronto that alerted
Niedermayer to the trade. ``If they've had past injuries, all they
have to say is, `Yeah, doc, I get a bit of a headache once in a
while,' to try to scare off the other team,'' said Murray. ``(The
news leaks) gave the player a chance to react to it. It affected
getting things done. I'm frustrated by that. I was ready to do
something big with Toronto.''  &UR; Mike Smith &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the Leafs' associate
GM, said he didn't leak any names. ``I've been accused by other GMs
of doing that, too, but that's not my style,'' said Smith. ``I
haven't done that and I won't do that.''

   It's Sept. 6 and the Bruins' five Group 2 free agents remain
unsigned. Time for somebody to blink, gentlemen ... The Lightning
spent the offseason rebuilding and have added some talent to what
was the worst team in hockey last year. However, one of their
returnees, forward  &UR; Alex Selivanov &LR; , &UR;  &LR; is expected to be out 8-12
weeks because of wrist surgery to repair torn cartilage. Selivanov
was injured during summer workouts ... Lightning forward  &UR; John
Cullen &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who is attempting to make a comeback after battling
cancer, is asking for a one-way contract, but owner  &UR; Art Williams
 &LR; is balking. ``I don't like the idea of him being guaranteed a big
income to go down and play in the minors if that's what ends up
happening,'' said Williams. ``We're trying to be sensitive here,
but I don't want anybody having a feeling of security. To me,
there's no room for negotiation.'' Cullen reportedly is asking for
a one-year, one-way deal for $350,000 _ whether the ex-Boston
University star makes the team or not. The Lightning have offered a
$500,000 salary for making the NHL team and $100,000 for playing in
the minors. Both sides have proposed bonus clauses that if reached
could bring Cullen $1 million ... Dallas's assistant GM,  &UR; Les
Jackson &LR; , &UR;  &LR; has left the Stars to take the same position with the
Atlanta Thrashers. Jackson had been a candidate for the Thrashers'
GM role, which went to  &UR; Don Waddell &LR; . ``Don and I go way back,''
said Jackson, 45. ``When I went there (to interview), I found it to
be such a neat setup. I felt it was such a good opportunity that I
wanted to jump in right now.'' Atlanta is due to come into the
league at the start of the 1999-2000 season. Jackson will have more
responsibility in his new role _ he will be in charge of scouting,
player development, and contract negotiations ... Former Canadiens
forward  &UR; Marc Bureau &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who signed with the Flyers as an
unrestricted free agent, said he thinks the Habs let him go because
he was too outspoken. ``I've been criticized for being too
upfront,'' said the 32-year-old, who agreed on a three-year pact in
Philly. ``But if that's all it was, that's not much. What counts is
that when the time came to do the job on the ice, I got it done.
And, anyway, the things I said never caused any problems. I still
don't understand why the Canadiens let me go, but I'm not alone
there. Unlike here (in Montreal), I feel wanted by the Flyers. The
day after I signed with Philadelphia, there was a message on my
answering machine from  &UR; Eric Lindros &LR; . I thought that was not
bad.'' ... Detroit coach  &UR; Scotty Bowman  &LR; continues his recovery
from heart surgery and a knee replacement operation. Bowman,
rehabilitating at his Buffalo home, is said to need 6-10 more weeks
of recovery. Red Wings associate coaches  &UR; Dave Lewis  &LR; and  &UR; Barry
Smith  &LR; will split the coaching duties in Bowman's absence, with
Lewis handling the defensemen and Smith guiding the forwards ... It
appears the career of 36-year-old center  &UR; Joel Otto  &LR; is over. The
Flyers declined to pick up an option on Otto's contract, and Otto
has moved his family back to Calgary. ``I'm going out in the
sunset,'' said Otto. ``I'm just kind of fading away. I've had
enough ... and the feeling is probably mutual. I haven't put out
any feelers. I just decided it's time to settle my family down and
spend some time with them. I'm sure, with September here, it'll be
different, but I'm ready to leave the game and move on. Things can
change, but for the time being, Calgary's where we want to be.''
... Former Bruin  &UR; Steve Leach  &LR; has changed teams. After he played
45 games for Carolina last year, getting four goals and nine
points, the Hurricanes bought out Leach's deal and the 32-year-old
right wing agreed to terms with the Ottawa Senators, who are
looking to add grit and leadership to their lineup ... Attorney
 &UR; Brian Cook  &LR; reports that forward  &UR; Eric Healey &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who was a Hobey
Baker candidate and finished second in the ECAC in scoring with 21
goals and 48 points in 35 games with RPI, signed a one-year,
two-way contract with the Calgary Flames. Healey is a native of
Hull and his father,  &UR; Tom &LR; , &UR;  &LR; is a Quincy police detective ... 34
days to opening night.

LEAGUE, PLAYERS IN LEGAL LIMBO

<TEXT>
<P>
   Since the NBA imposed its lockout July 1, negotiators from the
league and the players union have had exactly one bargaining
meeting. It ended in disaster, with the NBA contingent abruptly
leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Now the two sides are in arbitration over an issue that the
league feels is, to quote Hamilton Burger, irrelevant, incompetent,
and immaterial. The union is in litigation mode, hoping to get an
arbitrator to sock it to the owners where it hurts the most: in
their portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   Arbitrator John Feerick, whose split-the-baby mentality resulted
in the disastrous Latrell Sprewell decision last season, is again
hearing evidence. The issue is whether the players who have
guaranteed contracts _ as almost all of them do _ should get their
money during a lockout. It's a novel concept, but with Feerick,
anything is possible.
</P>
<P>
   However, unlike the Sprewell mess, Feerick's decision is
appeal-able. If he finds that the players were wrongly denied their
dough, NBA consigliore Jeff Mishkin will head to court and ask for
a stay of execution, er, implementation. That could drag things out
even more. Then again, if the NBA is to lose games, which seems
unavoidable, better to do it in November and December when no one
(including benefactor NBC) is paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA disputes even Feerick's jurisdiction in hearing the
case. It insists his term as arbitrator expired when the lockout
began. But the union filed its motion shortly before the lockout
began, so it says Feerick's role is entirely proper.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA also feels that this dispute is not over basketball
issues, but instead concerns labor law. The league contends that
labor law allows the owners to withhold money as surely as a strike
allows workers to withhold services. The players did not get paid
during the 1995 lockout. Hockey players were not paid when they
were locked out in '94.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony before Feerick may conclude Tuesday or spill over to
one more session. There is time to file additional briefs, with a
decision probably due by the end of the month. Then the fun should
start.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, the sides may be back to where they should be: at
the bargaining table. Word has it both sides have agreed on the
size of the table, the brand of coffee to be served, and the size
and color of the window dressings, and may actually talk again as
soon as this week.
</P>

   Assuming sanity prevails, a risky assumption given the
principals involved, there is a new wrinkle to the NBA schedule
this season. For the first time in more than a decade, the season
won't start on a Friday and end on a Sunday. Instead, the games are
scheduled to start on a Tuesday (Nov. 3, election day) and end on a
Wednesday (April 21). The change was made primarily to accommodate
NBC, the former Official Network of the Chicago Bulls. The network
will be able to air more games, both in the regular season and in
the playoffs. It also will have two sets of weekend games in the
usually forgettable first playoff round, which will now be a
best-of-five series spread over two weeks. The new schedule also
will, in all probability, eliminate back-to-back playoff games (a
second-round problem) and similarly do away with head-to-head
conflicts between TBS and TNT in the postseason. NBA schedule czar
 &UR; Matt Winick  &LR; said he couldn't remember the last time the season
didn't end on a weekend, but speculated it was probably in the
1970s. The concessions to NBC and TNT/TBS were unavoidable due to
the astronomical sums they are paying in rights fees, he suggested.
The Celtics, meanwhile, don't get the cushy start they got last
year, when they played 16 of their first 25 at home (and two of the
roadies were in Toronto). This time, 14 of their first 26 are at
home, although among those 14 are annual titans Golden State,
Vancouver, Toronto, Denver, Sacramento, and the Clippers. (Draft
picks 1-5 and 7 last June. Get your seats early!) However, they
also have to take the Texas three-step in the first week of
December. The Bulls, whatever their appearance, make their first
appearance Nov. 11, while  &UR; Larry Bird  &LR; and the Pacers stop by for
the first time Jan. 8. One of the real schedule jaw-droppers is a
Sunday prime-timer (5:30 p.m. start) April 4 against the Nets in
the FleetCenter ... It didn't take  &UR; Dino Radja  &LR; long to decide that
the grass was greener where he was last year. The former Celtic
re-signed with Panathinaikos _ he earlier had exercised an opt-out
clause _ for one year. The deal-clincher: Radja is basically exempt
from practices. ``His knees are shot,'' agent  &UR; Marc Fleisher  &LR; said
of his Split-raised bread winner. ``He gave serious thought to
retiring, and as it is, he'll probably play only one more year.
There was no way he could get through an 82-game (NBA) season.''
Fleisher said Radja was intrigued by the prospect of joining the
Bulls or Knicks for their respective playoff runs last year, but
nothing came of it ... Another client of Fleisher, Yugoslav  &UR; Dejan
Bodiroga &LR; , &UR;  &LR; was the Most Valuable Player in the recently concluded
World Championships. Bodiroga, who will also play for
Panathinaikos, is the property of the Kings, who selected him in
the second round of the 1995 NBA draft. ``There were three teams
that I know of that expressed an interest to trade with the Kings
for his rights,'' Fleisher said of the versatile 6-foot-8-inch
forward, who is in his mid-20s. ``I don't think he'll go (to
Sacramento). I think he wants a bigger market.'' Fleisher said
Bodiroga could well jump to the NBA for the 1999-2000 season ...
The phone rang early one morning recently at the Ford home on the
Jersey shore. Things were going well for  &UR; Chris Ford &LR; ; &UR;  &LR; he was
still the coach of the Milwaukee Bucks and he had just sold one of
his summer homes. He liked the chances for the team this season.
But by the time he hung up with Bucks general manager  &UR; Bob
Weinhauer &LR; , &UR;  &LR; he was an ex-coach and was soon scrambling to get his
kids into Boston-area schools while making plans to move back here
to the family manse in Lynnfield. There's only one way to describe
Ford's reaction to the firing: utter surprise. He had no inkling it
was coming. ``That's true,'' he said last week. ``I was very
surprised.'' There had been rumors all spring and up to the lockout
that he was on thin ice. ``But I thought because we were well into
August that it had all worked out,'' he said. Conspiracy buffs had
long thought eventual hiree  &UR; George Karl  &LR; to be in the mix, due
mainly to his friendship with  &UR; Rick Majerus &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who is this tight
with Bucks boss  &UR; Herb Kohl  &LR; (who prefers to be known as The
Senator). There also was talk that  &UR; Al McGuire  &LR; was pushing Kohl to
hire Cincinnati's  &UR; Bob Huggins &LR; . Ford will draw a salary this year
and figures he has some serious family time/satellite dish watching
ahead. ``I'll see what's out there,'' he said. ``There are some
openings, but I don't know how open they really are. But you never
say never. Right now, my immediate plans are to get settled in and
wait for the (moving) truck, which gets here Tuesday. Once we get
settled, I'll see what's out there.'' If Ford, or the NBA, stays
out of action, he will get the chance to see his daughter,
 &UR; Katie &LR; , &UR;  &LR; play college hoops for that renowned Division 3
juggernaut, Williams College ... Sacramento, the Clippers, and
Denver all have coaching vacancies. If the three teams pooled their
available talent, they might be as good as, oh, Cleveland. The name
of  &UR; Kurt Rambis  &LR; is out there for both California openings, though
we're not sure if it's because Rambis can actually coach or that
his agent,  &UR; Lon Rosen &LR; , &UR;  &LR; is, as they say, working both sides
against the middle. Sacramento owner  &UR; Jim Thomas  &LR; is a certified
Laker wannabe, and that may help Rambis. However, Thomas is due to
relinquish his majority share in ownership to the Maloof family,
the same one that owned the Rockets when Houston played the Celtics
in the 1981 NBA Finals.

   Mention the name  &UR; Olden Poly &LR; - &UR; nice &LR;  around the NBA, and most
coaches or general managers who've had to deal with the loopy free
agent center will reach for the extra strength Tylenol. So it
wasn't without a chuckle that we saw that a clause in a 1994
contract signed by Polynice was submitted by the union as evidence
in the guaranteed contract arbitration case.
</P>
<P>
   In the contract, there is classic lockout language. ``The Kings
insisted on it,'' said Polynice's agent,  &UR; Keith Glass &LR; . ``I don't
even remember why. (There was talk of a players' strike in the
summer of 1995.) I was shocked, and I highlighted it.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA says it isn't concerned; the league contends the clause
dealt with money Polynice would have to pay back from a $500,000
advance he took on the contract.
</P>
<P>
   Glass no longer represents Polynice, but he is supportive of the
union and its fight. ``In the next millennium,'' he said, ``when
historians study the 1990s in America, they will be scratching
their heads over two things: Why do men have to pay their ex-wives
and why is there a salary cap?''

EAGLES TURN UP HEAT FROM THE START 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Boston College didn't get much respect from the
Southern folks. A story in Friday's Atlanta Journal Constitution
kidded that ``BC'' stood for the last time Boston College had a
good football team. There were other remarks about this being a
Georgia Tech warmup game for North Carolina, and stuff about a
second-rate team from a second-rate conference. Last year's 42-14
Tech victory at Chestnut Hill no doubt contributed to the
overconfidence.
</P>
<P>
   All of the above sweetened Saturday's 41-31 BC victory over
Georgia Tech. On a brutally hot Georgia day, BC's Mike Cloud ran
for a cumulus 203 yards and Scott Mutryn completed 16 of 26 passes
for 220 yards and one touchdown (plus two TDs on the ground) as the
Eagles opened their season with an upset win in the heart of the
South.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they gave us any respect,'' said second-year BC
coach Tom O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made a few comments about this being a warmup for North
Carolina,'' said Cloud. ``That added a little spark underneath
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior offensive lineman Doug Brzezinski said, ``We wanted to
prove we were an opponent worth playing.''
</P>
<P>
   And Mutryn added, ``Did they overlook us? Maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   Folks take football seriously in these parts, which might
explain why BC was so easy to disrespect. Tech has some tradition
to go along with four national championships since 1917. The Yellow
Jackets play at Bobby Dodd Stadium/-Grant Field, which was built in
1913 (one year after Fenway Park) and is the granddaddy of all
Division 1-A football sites. John Heisman himself coached here.
Only Penn and Harvard play in older stadiums, and the Ivies no
longer play with the big boys.
</P>
<P>
   Tech's home field sits in the heart of the campus, which served
as site of the 1996 Olympic Village. The campus swimming pool is
where Ireland's Michelle Smith won three gold medals, laughin' and
lyin' her way through those post-swim drug tests.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone could have used a dunk in the pool Saturday. It was 93
degrees at game time with typical tropical humidity. The 3:30
starting time only exaggerated the stifling conditions.
</P>
<P>
   None of the sun-bleached 38,229 seemed to mind. Heavyweight
champ Evander Holyfield, an Atlanta resident, didn't even break a
sweat as he watched from press level. But O'Brien was mindful of
the heat and rotated his players (including Tim Hasselbeck for
Mutryn for one series) throughout the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were tough conditions,'' said O'Brien. ``You can't get
this kind of heat in Boston. It was hot out there and these kids
were sucking air. But we hung in and outscored 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles looked a little too much like Harvard in their snappy
new red pants, but they played like some of BC's recent bowl teams.
</P>
<P>
   It should have been a good omen when Tech's first attempt to
score _ a 34-yard field goal try _ clanged off the right upright.
Proving they were not as slow as O'Brien feared, the Eagles clawed
to a 10-0 lead before Tech made it 10-7 midway through the second
period.
</P>
<P>
   With just over a minute left in the first half, BC's Brian Maye
intercepted a pass, and four plays later Rob Tardio caught a
15-yard TD pass from Mutryn to give BC a 17-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   It was a touchdown of infinite redemption. Along with long
snapper Kyle Geiselman, Maye and Tardio are the only BC players
involved in the 1996 gambling scandal who play for the Eagles. Maye
is in his sixth year at the Heights, which makes him BC's version
of Dennis Eckersley. His appearance Saturday was his first since
October 1996, also his first since the scandal broke. He is
cocaptain of the 1998 Eagles. Maye finished with four tackles.
Tardio had a career-best six catches for 52 yards.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien smothered his enthusiasm:
</P>
<P>
   ``I told 'em a story. In 1986 (when O'Brien was coaching
Virginia), we beat South Carolina and everybody had us going to a
bowl. We finished 3-8 because the team was satisfied after that
first win. Now there's going to be a lot of poison by you (media)
and kids on campus telling them how good they are, and if they
drink it, they're gonna die. You can't be satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles' home opener is next week against Rutgers.

GIFTED IVANISEVIC TAKES IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There are tasteful birthday presents, and then ... it
depends on your taste, of course. It seems safe to say that a pair
of handcuffs isn't your everyday present, unless you're a US
marshal.
</P>
<P>
   Goran Ivanisevic, who is not a US marshal, stared at the box
curiously Saturday, and couldn't stand the suspense. He had to see
what was inside, even though the card instructed: ``Don't open
until your birthday.'' That will not occur until next Sunday when
Goran, the quixotic tennis player from Croatia, hopes he will at
last bust his reputation as a bust in the majors by winning the US
Open.
</P>
<P>
   Suspense hadn't entered into his third-round victory as he
cuffed Paul Haarhuis around with 21 aces, 7-6 (7-5), 6-3, 6-4. That
slots him against the champ, Patrick Rafter, Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But how could he resist a package that the postman delivered to
Flushing Meadow? Ivanisevic's colleagues in the locker room were
very pleased that he couldn't because, in Rafter's words: ``He got
some funny things in the mail today. Handcuffs. We're all having a
good laugh about that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``First time in my life I see handcuffs,'' rumbles Ivanisevic in
that distinctive bass voice, deeper than his sorrow at blowing the
Wimbledon final to Pete Sampras. ``I want to kill myself,'' was his
most cheery statement at that time.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I never seen them.''
</P>
<P>
   Had he been appointed sheriff of Flushing? Or was the gift a
suggestion that he cuff himself to a tree in the Petrified Forest
as penance for losing here in the first round three of the last
four years?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no,'' he smiles rakishly. ``Is from a girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, a sort of romantic message? This brings to mind Patti Paige
warbling ``Love Letters Straight From the Heart'' or Joe Cocker
with ``I Sent My Baby a Letter.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the cuffs represent the dreaded double-bagel, or an
instrument he wishes he could have used on Sampras, Ivanisevic
seems recovered from his post-Wimbledon depression.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter says Ivanisevic, who fell to No. 14 after six years in
the top 10, is ``the best player of this day never to win a major.
There's more to him than just the big serve.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Goran's 36th major try since falling in his first, the
Wimbledon first round of 1988, and he's never come closer here than
a semifinal defeat by Sampras two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good mate of mine. Why? Because Goran's crazy,'' Rafter
laughs. ``We really get along. But there's no love lost when we
play.''
</P>
<P>
   During a frustrating moment of his difficult four-set victory
over Todd Martin Thursday night, Ivanisevic knelt on the court and
pounded his head against the asphalt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great,'' he recalls. ``I started to play better.
Probably something, sometimes I have a little bit messed up in
there. I have to bang _ then everything comes together.''
</P>
<P>
   If Goran continues banging his serve and his head productively
against the mean green slabs, the quick hard courts of Flushing, he
may slip the cuffs off his terrible record in the majors and give
himself the best birthday present of all a week from Sunday.

SUPPLEMENT USER STRIKING OUT

   What drug did Randy Barnes, the Olympic shot put champion, take
to get him booted from his sport for life? The same stuff that's
helping Mark McGwire chase Roger Maris from baseball's record book.
Androstenedione may be shrugged off as a harmless nutritional
supplement by major league baseball, but the International Olympic
Committee considers it a steroid and has banned it. Barnes, who
claims he didn't know andro was a no-no when he tested positive
last spring, is appealing, but odds are he's finished.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the IOC, conceding that it's been losing the doping
war for years, has called a special global summit for February to
decide what should and shouldn't be banned and how to police it.
While athletes have been bulking up on epitestosterone and human
growth hormone and going undetected, the Lords of the Rings have
been chasing Sudafed users and marijuana smokers and trying to do
it all for a paltry $20 million on drug tests. As it is, roughly
half of American athletes picked for random tests by the US Olympic
Committee get off because it costs too much to find them.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Why did those five East German coaches and doctors get off with
fines after a Berlin court convicted them of feeding steroids to
unsuspecting young swimmers for more than a decade? Because they'd
already confessed and apologized to the athletes after claiming
they didn't know the drugs were harmful. Meanwhile, one of the
swimmers is sterile and the others have suffered from side effects
... The Russian economy may be melting down, but Saturday's Grand
Prix track and field final went on as scheduled in Moscow. Though
50 athletes, led by US sprinter  &UR; Jon Drummond &LR; , &UR;  &LR; petitioned to have
the IAAF move the meet because of the chaos in the Motherland, the
federation assured everybody that they would be secure and well
paid ($3.7 million in hard currency, not rubles). Meanwhile, there
are modest expectations for the United States at this week's
quadrennial World Cup meet in Johannesburg. The Yanks, who compete
for the Americas team under the continental format, were sixth
(men) and eighth (women) last time. Top names include
sprinter-jumper  &UR; Marion Jones &LR; , &UR;  &LR; shot putter-discus thrower  &UR; John
Godina &LR; , &UR;  &LR; 400-meter runner  &UR; Jerome Young &LR; , &UR;  &LR; hurdlers  &UR; Bryan
Bronson &LR; , &UR; Reggie Torian &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Kim Batten &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and distance runner
 &UR; Regina Jacobs &LR; . Africa (men) and Europe (women) are defending
champions ... Odds are you won't see anyone try to match the
200/400 double that  &UR; Michael Johnson  &LR; and  &UR; Marie-Jose Perec  &LR; pulled
off last time at next year's world championships in Seville, Spain.
Both events have rounds on the same day. And Jones, who's trying to
pull off a  &UR; Carl Lewis  &LR; multiple, has qualifying for the 100 and
long jump 15 minutes apart ... Barely two months after it regained
the world title, the US women's basketball team has already begun
choosing up folks for the 2000 Olympics.  &UR; Lisa Leslie &LR; , &UR; Nikki
McCray &LR; , &UR; Dawn Staley &LR; , &UR; Jennifer Azzi &LR; , &UR; Ruthie
Bolton-Holifield &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Katie Smith &LR; , &UR;  &LR; all members of the world
team, have been named to the national team that will compose the
bulk of the Sydney roster. All but Smith also won gold medals in
Atlanta two years ago. Four of them (Staley and Bolton-Holifield
are coming off knee surgery) will play for the squad that's Down
Under this week for five games against the Australians ... Who says
the Yugoslavs are men's world basketball champs? Not the Harlem
Globetrotters, who've challenged them to a friendly game for
planetary bragging rights. The Washington Generals get losers.

   Tough act to follow for the US rowers at this week's world
regatta in Cologne after last year's six &UR;  &LR; medals, three of them
gold. Four of the champion men's eight return, as does sculler
 &UR; Jamie Koven &LR; .  &UR; Sarah Garner &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who won the women's lightweight
single, is in the double this time. Local rowers include East
Bridgewater's  &UR; Wendy Wilbur  &LR; (women's eight), Boston RC's  &UR; Adam
Holland  &LR; and Newburyport's  &UR; Cy Beasley  &LR; (men's pair), Charles River
RC's  &UR; Greg Ruckman  &LR; and  &UR; Steve Tucker  &LR; (men's lightweight double),
Manchester's  &UR; Josh Crosby  &LR; (men's lightweight pair), Norwood's
 &UR; Carol Skricki  &LR; (women's double), Cambridge's  &UR; Terry Paige
 &LR; (women's lightweight quad), and  &UR; Wolf Moser  &LR; of Center Harbor,
N.H. (men's coxed four). The host Germans, who won 11 medals last
year, are favored to top the table. The Cologne regatta is the
first to have its own theme song, written and performed by six
German oarsmen who've cut a CD that includes party mix, gala mix,
and electro mix versions of the theme ... Gutsy performance by
 &UR; Blaine Wilson &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who shrugged off a torn rotator cuff to win his
third straight US men's gymnastics title, the first three-peat
since  &UR; Kurt Thomas  &LR; in 1978. Nice comeback by 22-year-old  &UR; Kim
Zmeskal &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the former world champ who placed 11th (and made the
women's senior national team) six years after her last major
international meet.  &UR; Kristen Maloney &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who's been the top woman
all year, knocked off defending champ  &UR; Vanessa Atler  &LR; for the
title, with  &UR; Dominique Moceanu  &LR; third ... Russian Greco-Roman
wrestler  &UR; Alexander Karelin &LR; , &UR;  &LR; arguably the most dominant athlete
in his sport in the world, kept his amazing lifetime unbeaten
streak going at the recent world championships in Sweden by pinning
US superheavy  &UR; Matt Ghaffari  &LR; in a rematch of their 1996 Olympic
duel. Karelin, who has won 11 consecutive Olympic or world titles,
has never lost an international match. The Russians, as expected,
easily won the team title while taking four of the eight golds.
Ghaffari, competing internationally for the first time since
Atlanta, won the only medal for the Americans, who ended up 11th.
The US freestylers, who won only two medals last year and placed
sixth amid post-Olympic rebuilding, figure to fare better at this
week's meet in Tehran ... The incredible shrinking US men's Alpine
A team is temporarily down to zero now that  &UR; Daron Rahlves  &LR; is out
of action with his second dislocated hip in two years. Rahlves, who
got a ski stuck while training recently on a Norwegian glacier,
hopes to be back on the slopes by November. With  &UR; Tommy Moe &LR; , &UR; AJ
Kitt &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Matt Grosjean  &LR; all retired and  &UR; Kyle Rasmussen  &LR; still
up in the air, Rahlves is literally The Man ... Back together again
are skating coach  &UR; Richard Callaghan  &LR; and wayward former pupil
 &UR; Nicole Bobek &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who is now on her 12th mentor in the past decade,
several of them twice. Callaghan coached Bobek to her US title and
world bronze medal three years ago and she went into a tailspin
after they parted company, made worse by the untimely death of
coach  &UR; Carlo Fassi  &LR; at the 1997 world championships. Bobek will
split her time between Richmond, where she now lives, and Detroit,
where Callaghan coaches ... Aching limbs and no medals for the
Yanks at the recent world triathlon championships in hilly
Lausanne, Switzerland. Top finishers in the new Olympic sport were
 &UR; Barb Lindquist  &LR; (seventh) and  &UR; Wes Hobson  &LR; (23d). Great Britain's
 &UR; Simon Lessing  &LR; and Australia's  &UR; Joanne King  &LR; were the victors ...
Unless synchronized swimmer  &UR; Bill May  &LR; has a sex-change operation
or can persuade the international federation to alter its rules,
he's essentially limited to domestic waters. Though May and partner
 &UR; Kristina Lum  &LR; are US champions in duet, they can't compete in next
summer's Pan-American Games because the event follows FINA rules,
which ban males from the Olympics, world championships, and World
Cup.

DALY STRUGGLES, ONE DAY AT A TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The saga of John Daly continues. The latest chapter was
written in the first round of the Greater Vancouver Open a week ago
Thursday, when he became overcome by shakes and a chill and began
crying on the 15th hole. He was trembling, bundled up in two
jackets on an 80-degree day.
</P>
<P>
   Daly says he has been sober since Easter weekend of 1997, when
he went out of control in a Jacksonville beach club and tore up a
room in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla. This led to a separation with his
third wife, Paulette, but they were back together in July during
the British Open at Royal Birkdale, where he missed the cut. Daly
has missed four cuts in his last six tournaments, has withdrawn
from the fifth, and was disqualified in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   His history has been well documented. When Daly returned to the
PGA Tour a year ago at the Memorial after a stint at the Betty Ford
Clinic, he gave a lengthy press conference at Muirfield Village.
``I surrounded myself with people that love me for the problem that
I have,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Daly played in the US Open at Congressional and walked off the
course after nine holes of the second round without telling anyone,
not even his caddie. He returned to the fairways at the Greater
Hartford Open, and talked about his problems with the shakes,
caused, he said, by the excessive amount of Diet Coke he was
drinking.
</P>
<P>
   He got off to a superb start this season, seemed content at The
Players Championship at Ponte Vedra Beach, but 17 of his last 48
rounds have been 75 or higher. There have been no reports that he
has been back on alcohol, but perhaps, as John Garrity wrote in
Sports Illustrated, there is a depression problem that should be
examined.
</P>
<P>
   Daly is too big a force on the PGA Tour to let it get away from
him.

   There was good reason to celebrate when  &UR; Mike Baker &LR; , &UR;  &LR; a native
of Bangor, Maine, who serves as assistant pro at Bangor Municipal
GC, won the 78th New England PGA Championship Thursday at Agawam
Hunt Club. He won an enthralling duel with  &UR; Frank Dully &LR; , &UR;  &LR; a Holy
Cross graduate in his first year as head professional at Kernwood
CC.
</P>
<P>
   Baker dedicated the victory to his father, who died last
November. ``He worked with me on the mental part of the game,''
said the 36-year-old, who finished third in the Maine Open this
year and was the only member of the NEPGA to make the cut in the
National Club Pro Championship at Pinehurst, N.C. ``He was very
calm. He'd say, `Think before you speak.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He got me into a good frame of mind as far as putting. He'd
say to use the same routine and the same amount of time over the
ball. He wasn't a real student of the game, but if you talk to any
of the pros, that's a good thing to do. I like to look at it from a
few different angles, but I don't want to take all day.''
</P>
<P>
   The question now is whether Baker will give the PGA Tour
Qualifying School a second look _ he tried a decade ago _ now that
his NEPGA win has given him an exemption into the second round.
``It's definitely not as time-consuming now,'' he said. ``I
wouldn't have to be away from my son as much. I have until Sept. 18
(to decide).''

   There are two exciting golfing projects in the works in Vermont.
 &UR; Jim Remy &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the immediate past president of the NEPGA, left his
job at Killington to take over as general manager and director of
golf at Okemo Valley in Ludlow, where he will build a course for
owners  &UR; Tim  &LR; and  &UR; Dianne Mueller &LR; . ``We're also going to build a
golf learning center with a full academy,'' he said at the NEPGA
Championship. ``It's under construction now and will open sometime
in the late summer next year. It's a par 71, about 6,700 yards.''
The architect is  &UR; Steve Durkee &LR; . More details from Remy: ``We're
also building a 22,000-square-foot clubhouse, and we'll get it
under construction in about a week. We're going to have membership,
resort, and public golf. The learning center will have a 350-yard
driving range, a chipping and putting green. We're going to have an
indoor learning center where we can take people in inclement
weather and in the winter. There's going to be 4,200 square feet of
indoor hitting area, a computer simulator, a 600-square-foot indoor
putting area, a golf classroom area, and a video review station.''
The first nine holes of the course, located about 25 miles
southeast of Rutland, should be open by next July, along with the
academy. The second nine holes are expected to open in the fall ...
 &UR; Larry Startzel &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who won the NEPGA Championship in 1979 at
Ferncroft while he was head pro at Stowe CC in Northern Vermont,
returns to the region after a varied tour of duties that took him
from the CC of Lansing (1981-87) in Michigan to Paradise Valley CC
in Phoenix (1988-91) to a stint as director of the Jordan Tour
(1992) to Yahnundasis GC outside Utica, N.Y. (1993-97). He has
signed on to become general manager and director of golf at the new
Country Club of Vermont just outside Stowe. He was lured by a group
of developers to the exclusive course, which will eventually be
restricted. ``I started working last fall,'' said Startzel, who
finished at 76-75-82_233 in the NEPGA Championship. ``It's a very
upscale, private-equity club. It's just pure golf. It's 450 acres
and nothing but golf. There's no housing.'' There are 17 holes
already open on the course designed by  &UR; Grahame Cooke  &LR; of Montreal.
The 18th will be opened next month. ``I was doing consulting work
for them for about a year and a half,'' said Startzel. ``I went up
to look at the property, and they offered me a position. It's just
a phenomenal golf course with tremendous vistas. Every par 4 and
par 5 is an elevated tee shot. I had a huge job, but I'd never
opened a golf course before and I've never been a general manager.
It's sort of where in this industry things are going. I like the
people, and this course is being built for golfers to walk and not
to ride.'' There is some outside play now, but when the membership
is filled out at 260 _ likely within two years _ it will be made
private. There are 127 members presently.

   They were bracing for a few weeks at the old course at
Ballybunion in the west of Ireland's County Kerry for Saturday's
visit from  &UR; President Clinton  &LR; during his trip to Ireland. It was
originally thought that  &UR; Tom Watson &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who performed some
architectural modifications to the course, might join Ireland's
 &UR; Christy O'Connor Jr. &LR;  and club captain  &UR; Brian McCarthy  &LR; in the
presidential foursome. Watson, who began stopping off to play a few
rounds en route to the British Open in the early 1980s and started
a flurry of stopovers that included  &UR; Tiger Woods &LR; , &UR; Mark
O'Meara &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Ernie Els  &LR; this year before the championship at
Royal Birkdale, was approached to make the refinements three years
ago to strengthen the great links course on the cliffs overlooking
the Atlantic Ocean. Clinton was scheduled to play Ballybunion a few
years ago but had to cancel. He promised to return. There are few
tee times available on the old course, but exceptions can be made.
``Right now,'' said club secretary/-manager  &UR; Jim McKenna &LR; , &UR;  &LR; ``the
first tee for visitors is booked up almost to 1999. I spend most of
my working day turning down golfers who want to play here.'' ...
The Europeans named  &UR; Mark James  &LR; as Ryder Cup captain for the
matches next year at The Country Club, and it's something of an
irony. The first time the Europeans were included in the mix with
the Great Britain/-Irish makeup was 19 years ago at the Greenbrier,
and James was one of two ``bad boys,'' according to the Irish
Independent. James was fined a record 1,500 pounds by the European
PGA Tour and  &UR; Ken Brown  &LR; was banned from team matches for a year.
Now James is Europe's leader, but ironically again has stirred the
embers by refusing to show up for a scheduled media day involving
US captain  &UR; Ben Crenshaw  &LR; at The Country Club on Sept. 22. The PGA
of America subsequently canceled the event. Why the presence of
James, who said he had a commitment to play in the German Masters
in Cologne, was so essential is a mystery. Who in the world is Mark
James? ... A golfing gala was held Monday to celebrate the
centennial of Wannamoisett CC in Rumford, R.I., where the
prestigious Northeast Amateur has been held for the past 37 years.
 &UR; Brad Faxon &LR; , &UR; Billy Andrade &LR; , &UR; John Cook &LR; , &UR; Dana Quigley &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and the
Senior Tour's  &UR; Jay Sigel  &LR; along with host pro  &UR; Steve Napoli  &LR; played
in an exhibition match. Cook won the Northeast twice (1978, 1979)
and set a course record (8 under par) in 1979 that still stands.
Cook, who flew in after finishing fourth in the World Series of
Golf, hadn't been to the club since his last appearance in the
Northeast Amateur ...  &UR; Harry McCracken &LR; , &UR;  &LR; virtually a lifetime
member at Charles River CC, has organized a new event, the New
England Golf Association's Senior Championship, which will be
played Sept. 21-22 at Metacomet CC. The field includes former
Massachusetts Amateur champions  &UR; Bill Foley  &LR; of Wollaston and  &UR; Ed
Fletcher  &LR; of Bay Pointe and former New England Amateur champion
 &UR; Fred Kask  &LR; of Wethersfield, Conn. The second McCracken Cup will be
played at Charles River the following weekend, making this a hearty
month for the veteran amateur golf official and organizer ...
 &UR; Ronnie Quinn &LR; , &UR;  &LR; one of Rhode Island's noted players, winning the
State Amateur five times, died Aug. 22. He also won the Northeast
Amateur twice in the late 1960s, the New England Amateur, the
Porter Cup, the Rhode Island Open twice, and qualified for the US
Open in 1967 at Baltusrol. He was a Providence attorney who played
out of West Warwick CC, and though he competed only sparingly, he
compiled a noted record. He also was known for playing occasionally
with  &UR; President Eisenhower  &LR; when the summer White House was in
Newport. The president invited him on one occasion to play Augusta
National GC, and Quinn responded by shooting a 68 ... The upcoming
schedule shows qualifying for the USGA Mid-Amateur Championship
Tuesday at Brae Burn, where 123 will vie for seven spots in the
tournament proper (Oct. 3-8) over the South Course at NCR CC in
Dayton, Ohio ... The qualifying for the 16 spots in the NEPGA
individual match play championship was played within the NEPGA
Championship, and Baker will meet No. 16  &UR; Scott Hickey  &LR; of Norton
CC to open play Sept. 30 at Prouts Neck CC.

TECHNICALLY, GRUDEN THE BEST COACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The first head coach of the 21st century starts work two years
ahead of time tonight.
</P>
<P>
   When the Oakland Raiders trot out to meet the Kansas City Chiefs
in the season's first Sunday night game, they will be led by the
youngest coach in pro football, which, historically speaking, bodes
well for them.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, a 33-year-old guy named Al Davis took over the Raiders
and transformed them from a 1-13 loser to a 10-4 winner in one
season. Six years later, Davis, by then the team's managing general
partner, elevated a little-known 32-year-old assistant named John
Madden to head coach and was vilified for it. Madden went on to
lead the Raiders to seven AFL or AFC title games and a victory in
Super Bowl XI.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, 34-year-old Jon Gruden will follow in that tradition,
taking over a team that gave the word underachiever new meaning
last season by parlaying a 1,200-yard rusher, a 1,400-yard
receiver, and a 3,900-yard passer into a 4-12 record, losing eight
of their last nine games, and prompting one longtime front office
employee to say this summer, ``It was the first time I ever went to
the stadium knowing we didn't have a chance to win. It was a bad
feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Such feelings could lead to only one thing, hence the arrival of
a new coach whom Green Bay's Mike Holmgren calls ``the Whiz Kid.''
Although his youthful face might make you wonder how much he can
possibly know about pro football, few coaches are believed to have
more of a grasp on the nuances of the West Coast offense than
Gruden, who is said to have every play ever run by it diagrammed
and stored on floppy disks that he keeps in a shoebox.
</P>
<P>
   Those disks also include the philosophies of Bill Walsh, the
great speeches of George Seifert, and the thinking of every
football mind Gruden has ever encountered, including the ones in
Philadelphia that he was supposed to leave behind when he joined
the Raiders in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   This process began in 1990 after Gruden had been hired to assist
Holmgren, who was then the San Francisco 49ers' offensive
coordinator. Before he got too settled, Gruden was given 30 days to
computerize the West Coast offense Holmgren had inherited from
Walsh and improved upon.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Gruden was 26 and knew two things about computers.
He knew the plug goes into the wall and he knew he'd better find a
techie to teach him more than that.
</P>
<P>
   After hiring such a person, he learned the basics and then went
to work day and night, with the emphasis on night. By the time
Holmgren returned, everything he'd ever done with his offense was
on floppy disks and Gruden's legend was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, I'm just a coach,'' the Raiders' newest boss insists
when asked if he should be considered the Bill Gates of coaching.
``So what that I know something about computers? It's not like I
went to Cal Poly.''
</P>
<P>
   No, as a matter of fact, he didn't. He went to the University of
Dayton, where he was a quarterback who had already chosen his
life's work before he got there. Gruden had spent hours sitting in
on coaches meetings of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, where his father
was an assistant under John McKay before moving into scouting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up a coach's son,'' Gruden said. ``I sat in running
back meetings with my Dad. I knew what I wanted to do since I was
9. I learned then that if you're an expert at something, you can
usually get a job. I wanted to be a quarterback coach even then.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually he would become receivers coach for Holmgren in Green
Bay before Eagles head coach Ray Rhodes made him the youngest
offensive coordinator in football in 1995 at the age of 31. If you
see a trend with this age thing, consider that it's a family trait.
Gruden's brother, Jay, is currently the youngest head coach in the
Arena Football League, although it is unknown whether he too needs
specially made anti-glare glasses like the ones the Raiders had
made for his brother so he wouldn't go half-blind staring at his
computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The computer can do so many things,'' Gruden says. ``It's a
great tool. Everyone in football should use it.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone does, but not everyone is its master. The Raiders have
two full-time computer operators who input information, but Gruden
does his own computer searches and studies, work that often begins
long before the sun rises.
</P>
<P>
   Nocturnal by nature, Gruden is generally working before any of
his colleagues, which is probably why in Philadelphia he helped
produce two playoff teams and a club last year that was second in
passing, fifth in rushing, and third in total offense in the NFC
despite spending much of the season without a true starting
quarterback until the eventual elevation of Bobby Hoying.
</P>
<P>
   But when he arrived there, Gruden's youth had many questioning
whether he was ready to run an NFL offense, just as some are now
questioning whether he's ready to run an NFL team. When the Eagles
lost their first game with him badly, he was no longer the Whiz
Kid.

   ``We lost like 21-6 at the Vet and I went from Boy Wonder to Boy
Blunder in three hours,'' Gruden recalls. ``I remember thinking,
`Maybe I bit off more than I could chew.' But I had a lot of
confidence in myself. I developed a thick skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually he would need it because Gruden learned about more
than computers and combatting NFL defenses in Philadelphia. He also
learned about head cases, which considering the Raiders' sorry
rec-ord last year may be knowledge he will put to good use.
</P>
<P>
   His problem in Philadelphia was mercurial running back Ricky
Watters. A great runner and receiver yet often a coach's nightmare,
Watters used to have signals he would direct to Gruden in the press
box if he didn't think he was getting the ball often enough.
</P>
<P>
   Watters would make a fist and beat his chest while staring up at
the coaches' box. Word is Gruden had a one-fingered signal he used
to send back most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did have our moments,'' says Gruden, a sly laugh following
his words.
</P>
<P>
   Gruden is free of Watters now but some would say he is tethered
to an even more difficult person in Davis. The Raiders' managing
general partner has been a successful coach and front office
operative and has his own philosophy of what the Raider Way should
be, one that has been proven out with three Super Bowl
championships. But it is not, in many ways, the Gruden Way and so
some speculate this may not be a marriage made in football heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Davis insisted that Gruden was the young mind he wanted most
last winter and Gruden says he sees no reason he cannot adapt the
legendary Raider deep passing game to the West Coast style while
benefitting greatly from Davis's counsel.
</P>
<P>
   But before he can do any of that, Gruden must resurrect a
battered legend. Once the most feared team in football, the Raiders
have been anything but the past dozen years. They've missed the
playoffs nine times and have not reached the postseason in five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Gruden has many of the building blocks his offensive mind
wants. He has a strong-armed quarterback in Jeff George, a great
speed receiver in Tim Brown, and a 1,000-yard rusher in Napoleon
Kaufman. He has a new defensive coordinator who is bringing a more
attacking, zone-blitz style that should force turnovers. And he has
two brand new cornerbacks with impressive hardware, veteran Pro
Bowler Eric Allen and rookie Heisman Trophy winner Charles Woodson.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, with the millennium on the horizon, the
Raiders have a coach for the 21st century. All he has to do is win
enough games the next two years to be here for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I can coach,'' Gruden says. ``Now I have the
opportunity to prove it. In Philadelphia, I never felt we weren't
going to win on Sunday. Maybe it's because I'm young but I feel the
same way here. I'm not going to the stadium conceding anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Jon Gruden is going to the stadium the same way coaches
from the turn of the century to the 21st century have gone. He's
going there to win.

   At a meeting Thursday, the NFL's Executive Committee reviewed
the bids of the four remaining suitors for the Cleveland franchise
and a couple of things became clear. The first is that the price
tag, which will be announced Tuesday when the 30 owners fly to
Chicago to vote on the new owner, will be in excess of the $500
million that has been predicted, according to several sources, and
that will be divided among only 28 of the league's 30 teams.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Rams and Baltimore Ravens surrendered their rights
to the expansion fee when they relocated into what the league
considered expansion cities. When they took those cities for
themselves, no such fee could be assessed on those two prime pieces
of NFL real estate, so they were cut out of the upcoming expansion
fee.
</P>
<P>
   Although no one can say for sure who will eventually get the 23
votes needed to win the bidding, the two finalists will be the  &UR; Al
Lerner &LR; - &UR; Carmen Policy  &LR; entry and the one submitted by  &UR; Chuck  &LR; and
 &UR; Larry Dolan &LR; , &UR;  &LR; with the former still holding the inside track.
</P>
<P>
   Many owners were angered by the actions of Ravens owner  &UR; Art
Modell  &LR; when he stood up and spoke against Lerner, his former
minority partner in the Browns. Modell urged the owners to support
the Dolan brothers' bid, but other owners felt the mess that
existed in Cleveland was of Modell's making and to try to influence
the solution now was the height of hubris.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lerner flew Modell to Baltimore on his private jet to
close his deal for the move to Maryland, he later backed away from
his longtime connection to Modell. Lerner held a 50 percent
interest in the stadium and a 9 percent interest in the Browns but
sold both and began form-ulating a plan to bring the NFL back to
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   The Executive Committee was shocked to learn that when  &UR; Howard
Milstein's  &LR; application was finally submitted, it did not include
the names of former Browns  &UR; Calvin Hill  &LR; and  &UR; Paul Warfield &LR; , &UR;  &LR; as
advertised. That alone may have pushed Milstein out of Tuesday's
final discussion, leaving Lerner and the Dolans to slug it out.
</P>
<P>
   Don't bet against Lerner, especially if Modell gets up and rips
him one more time on Tuesday.

   49ers wide receiver  &UR; Jerry Rice  &LR; acknowledged that he was
nervous about Sunday's game with the New York Jets because he
hadn't tested his twice-repaired knee in game conditions this
summer. Rice was injured in the first game of last season but came
back in December, only to crack his patella while scoring his first
touchdown minutes into the game. He was held out of this summer's
exhibition games but is said to be at full speed. Rice conceded
this challenge will be more mental than physical. ``I think the
main concern right now is being able to take the blows, jump up,
and go back in the huddle and just do what I've been doing over the
years,'' Rice said Wednesday. ``I'll be a little nervous out there
but I'm sure when it's time to play I'll come to play and I'll try
to make those plays I've been making over the years. I'm 100
percent but I have one more test. That test is being hit and being
able to jump and being able to continue in the ballgame. Right now
that's almost a battle from within.'' Rice said he has no regrets
about returning last December for the Monday night game at 3Com
Park. ``I still had the explosion, the cutting, and the burst off
the ball,'' he said. ``I felt like it was the right time to come
back. It was the highlight of my career _ just to be able to run on
that field on that Monday night with  &UR; Joe  &LR; ( &UR; Montana's &LR; ) jersey
being retired, the atmosphere was unbelievable.'' Sunday, on that
same field, the atmosphere will be apprehensive until the game's
greatest receiver takes the hits and reacts the way he has
throughout most of his career. By ignoring them ... Rice was not
surprised when he was made the game's highest-paid receiver last
week. Despite his age (35) and recent injuries, his new contract
extension and raise reflect what he has been doing thoroughout his
career. ``I think what I've done is set the standard for the other
receivers,'' Rice said of his new contract. ``They are trying to
make what I'm making.'' ... Although he changed the 49er offense
considerably last season by running the ball nearly 100 times more
than he threw it, head coach  &UR; Steve Mariucci  &LR; says no one should
think  &UR; Steve Young  &LR; won't be throwing to Rice this afternoon.
``Steve is healthy this year,'' Mariucci said. ``He feels great.
Last year we lost Jerry the first week and Steve got rocked
(suffering several concussions). Last year we didn't even have a
quarterback sneak in the game plan until the 13th week. When I went
to use it against Minnesota, Steve got rocked! This year our team
is different. Steve is healthy and Jerry is back. Plus we lost
(fullback)  &UR; William Floyd &LR; . We still want to be balanced but Steve
wants to get back into it and he will.'' ... Here's how much
respect his teammates have for Rice. Because Rice is in the
starting lineup, one of the 1997 starters who was very productive
must sit. To avoid a controversy,  &UR; Terrell Owens  &LR; went to Mariucci
and told him he did not have to start. ``He made that comment to me
and I was taken aback,'' Mariucci recalled. ``It was a concern of
mine how these three men would react to sharing the load. I thought
it was a first-class gesture.'' Owens made his suggestion after
scoring three touchdowns and producing 142 receiving yards against
Miami Aug. 23. Mariucci has chosen to have all three announced to
the opening day crowd, even though only two will be in the huddle
on the first play.

   The Chiefs continue to search for a veteran running back. Last
week they had in former New York Giant  &UR; Rodney Hampton &LR; , &UR;  &LR; but they
were concerned that he was heavy and out of shape, tipping the
scales at 240 pounds. What did they expect? He hasn't been in a
training camp all summer. They also worked out ex-Jet  &UR; Ron Moore
 &LR; ... Football super agent  &UR; Leigh Steinberg  &LR; knows business, and not
just the football business. He will be in Boston Wednesday to sign
copies of his new book, ``Winning with Integrity,'' as part of a
15-city tour. Alongside him at the South Shore Mall will be  &UR; Drew
Bledsoe &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who should help attract a crowd. Steinberg will have one
of his top clients at 12 of the stops, including  &UR; Kordell Stewart
 &LR; in Pittsburgh,  &UR; Warren Moon  &LR; in Seattle, Young in San Francisco,
 &UR; Troy Aikman  &LR; in Dallas,  &UR; Derrick Thomas  &LR; in Kansas City,  &UR; Ryan
Leaf  &LR; in San Diego,  &UR; Warrick Dunn  &LR; in Tampa,  &UR; Derrick Rogers  &LR; in
Miami, and  &UR; Jake Plummer  &LR; in Phoenix ... Buffalo running back
 &UR; Thurman Thomas  &LR; may be more upset than he has let on about backing
up budding star  &UR; Antowain Smith &LR; . Thomas went after several Buffalo
reporters this week and gave them personal tongue lashings for
suggesting he might be finished ... To say the Colts are starting
over is an understatement. Six of their nine offensive linemen have
two years' experience or less, and tight end  &UR; Ken Dilger  &LR; is their
oldest skill-position player and he's only 27. Although you may
think he's 105, running back  &UR; Marshall Faulk  &LR; is only 25 ... For
the first time in the 25-year history of the local TV blackout
rule, no NFL game will be blacked out this weekend. To accomplish
that, the Cincinnati Bengals had to be granted a 24-hour extension,
until 1 p.m. Friday, but they did sell out. The league is expecting
a record weekend attendance to exceed 1 million. The previous high
was 999,770 on the weekend of Nov. 23-24 last year ... Denver's
 &UR; Justin Armour  &LR; says he's learned from the mistakes of so many of
his contemporaries. The 25-year-old wide receiver recently
announced he was a virgin, saying his abstinence is rooted in his
Christian faith but adding that another benefit is ``it keeps you
out of trouble. I've never broken any hearts because I haven't
taken anything from anyone.'' ... Although there has been much talk
in New England about the effects of playing at altitude Monday
night in Denver, head coach  &UR; Pete Carroll  &LR; would have none of it.
``You can feel it walking upstairs in Mexico City, which is nearly
3,000 feet higher, but you're not going to die,'' Carroll said.
``There's plenty of air.'' ... Miami head coach  &UR; Jimmy Johnson
 &LR; said he's not sure that his Dolphins have solved their running
game problems but he was adamant that there is no turning back.
``The easy thing for us is to fall back and start throwing it once
the season starts if we find we're having problems, but we're not
going to do that,'' Johnson said. ``We know we're on the right
track. For me, I just look at past history. When we were most
successful in Dallas was when we ran it. We'll be better.'' Johnson
believes that taking audibles away from  &UR; Dan Marino  &LR; will make his
offensive line more aggressive because from huddle to play
completion there will be no hesitation in their minds. To reinforce
that, Johnson has changed the blocking to a more aggressive zone
style in which his players will come off the ball and attack ...
How important is Opening Day in the NFL? Well, since the advent of
the 16-game schedule in 1978, of the 269 teams who lost the first
game of the season, 209 (77.7 percent) failed to make the playoffs.

   &UR; Jamal Anderson  &LR; is trying to become the third Falcon back since
1981 to rush for 1,000 yards in three straight seasons.  &UR; William
Andrews  &LR; did it from 1979-81,  &UR; Gerald Riggs  &LR; from 1984-86 ...
Saints president  &UR; Bill Kuharich  &LR; has seen an alarming thing since
the advent of free agency in 1993. ``There's been only two players
we gave a lot of money to whose performance has increased,''
Kuharich said. ``That was  &UR; Wayne Martin  &LR; and  &UR; William Roaf &LR; .
Everyone else _  &UR; Pat Swilling &LR; , &UR; Renaldo Turnbull &LR; , &UR; Eric
Allen &LR; , &UR; Michael Haynes &LR;  _ slipped. There's a message there if we
all want to hear it.'' ... Here's an unexpected point of view on
guaranteed contracts from  &UR; Dave Wohl &LR; - &UR; abaugh's  &LR; agent,  &UR; Allan
Herman &LR; : ``I believe big signing bonuses are obviously a form of
guarantee that's good for the players. But NFL teams can still pull
the plug, and because they can, it keeps the players pure. They
know they still have to perform to stay on the team. It's the edge
football has over other sports. From my side, you'd like to see
guaranteed contracts but the fact is the owners have resisted it
because they've seen what's gone on in baseball and basketball.
Guarantees have got to interfere in the quality of the product.
It's the nature of human beings. As an ordinary citizen it's
disturbing to see a ( &UR; Latrell &LR; ) &UR; Sprewell  &LR; situation. Sure there are
coaches who can agitate you, but guaranteed contracts create some
of these problems. That situation would not exist in football.''
... Teams from coast to coast seem to be talking about nothing but
running the football this year. In Dallas, new head coach  &UR; Chan
Gailey  &LR; says, ``This is a tough game for tough people. You win by
running the football. We will run the football.'' Probably, but
will  &UR; Emmitt Smith  &LR; be the one doing the running? ... Dallas
quarterback  &UR; Troy Aikman  &LR; says he knows what's at stake this season
for the Cowboys, who are coming off a 6-10 year and an 0-5
preseason. ``I think this year we get exposed,'' Aikman said. ``I
think this year is going to tell us how good or how bad we are. At
the end of the season, we're going to know exactly what areas we
need to improve on and where we need some help and what exactly
happened in the draft over the last three or four years. I'm tired
of hearing why we went 6-10. It's time to go play and see if all
those reasons were valid or are we as good as we think we are?''
... When Plummer starts at quarterback this afternoon for Arizona,
it will mark only the second time since 1988 that the Cardinals
have had the same opening day quarterback two years in a row.
 &UR; Steve Beuerlein  &LR; started in 1993-94 ... Here's an interesting stat
from the maven of figures,  &UR; Bud Goode &LR; . According to Goode, if
you're intent on living and dying with the pass, one key statistic
has to be touchdowns-to-interceptions ratio. ``Champions have a 3-1
ratio,'' said Goode. ``New England does not.'' Goode predicts
another tough night for the Patriots in Denver, because
statistically speaking the Patriots are weakest where Denver is
strong. New England has averaged 24.8 rushing plays, which is 12
behind the league's leaders of a year ago and far too few to
control the clock.

CLAY LOOKS TO MOLD DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ Willie Clay is the prophet of the football sandlot.
</P>
<P>
   He's the one who stood boldly before reporters in Smithfield,
R.I., last year and said that defense would be the best part of the
Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   He backed it up. The defense came together, went through a few
downturns at midseason, but finished strong, allowing only one
touchdown in a 7-6 playoff loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers that
ended the season.
</P>
<P>
   Now the New England defense is applauded from Maine to Montana.
When the national analysts look at the Patriots, it's the defense
that stands out. And now it's become a classic scenario: The
defense will keep the Patriots in games and whatever the offense
can produce will be a bonus.
</P>
<P>
   How did it come to be that an offense with weapons such as Drew
Bledsoe and Terry Glenn and Ben Coates is the unit striving for
recognition?
</P>
<P>
   And, with the season opener on tap Monday night in Denver, does
the defense have to guard against being overconfident?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say we have to guard against having a big
head,'' said Clay, ``but I think you have to be careful about the
fact when we haven't done anything yet when it counts. Sure, we had
a good preseason, but I'm pretty sure a lot of teams looked good in
the preseason, and we have to go out and prove that we can do it
when it counts.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then you have to do it every week _ week in and week out.
Denver is a tough challenge but you have to play well against an
offense like that to prove how good you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that Clay's prediction has come true, he's not about to let
his fellow defensive players rest on their laurels. Veterans like
Clay and Chris Slade and Ted Johnson stay on their younger
teammates to get points across. The coaching staff is also taking
nothing for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you swallow up the hype, it could lead you down a bad
road,'' said head coach Pete Carroll. ``We have done what we set
out to do in the preseason. We got off to a fast start. It all
builds up to this. What we have said and done in the past means
absolutely nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed that's true because Terrell Davis and John Elway could
make it a long night for the defense. Certainly they have the last
three times they've played against the Patriots, who have lost by a
combined score of 105-24.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense is better now than it was last year, I can say
that,'' said Carroll. ``That sounds great, so now let's go and play
Denver and see what happens. Hey, they're better, too. But we have
a broader package of what we can do now because of our
experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   Clay says, for one thing, the Patriots are much more comfortable
in their base defense, after resorting to some gimmickry at the end
of last season to be completely effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've spent time in a system that we now understand,''
said Clay. ``We've done a lot of things and now we understand what
we're trying to get done. We've played together now for three
years. It's been good. It's been a good growing experience. But we
have to do well in our base defense all year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Denver game traditionally is the ultimate test for this
defense. The great runner (Davis), the great offensive line, the
great quarterback (Elway), and the big receivers combine for every
problem imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to play 60 minutes,'' said Clay. ``Sometimes we play
well and sometimes we don't hold it together. We have the talent.
We have as much talent as they do. We have enough tools offensively
that are comparable to their offense. They might have a better
running back, but we have other things, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``On defense, we feel we're better than them. It's not a thing
that they're a better team. What they have over us is that they
have more experience and they know how to win big games.''
</P>
<P>
   There is talk that the Denver offensive line is weaker because
of the retirement of Gary Zimmerman. But the Patriots have gone
through reel after reel of film and haven't seen much of a
drop-off.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as 30 (Davis) is back there, they'll be tough,'' said
Clay. ``You've got to get penetration in the backfield before he
gets going.''
</P>
<P>
   Stopping the run is where Clay feels the Patriots are a very
good team. Davis ran for 172 yards against them last year, but Clay
believes the Patriots are now better built to stop the run,
pointing not only to Johnson being a year older and wiser, but also
to the contributions of Ferric Collons and Chad Eaton on the
defensive line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chad and Ferric don't get a lot of limelight, but when it
comes to run defense, those two guys are around the ball all the
time,'' said Clay. ``What's also good is that we have a rotation on
the defensive line where we can keep eight people pretty fresh
throughout the game. I think that has to wear out the opposition
after a while.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Broncos' receivers having a huge height advantage _ Ed
McCaffrey is 6 feet 5 inches, Rod Smith 6-1, and Willie Green 6-4 _
Clay and strong safety Lawyer Milloy will have to give a lot of
help to Chris Canty, who at 5-9 is the smallest Patriots
cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   Clay, like many, thinks Canty has come far and earned the right
to be the starter. Can he be better than Jimmy Hitchcock?
</P>
<P>
   ``Potentially he can, but that's hard to tell,'' said Clay, who
led the Patriots with six interceptions a year ago. ``Jimmy didn't
get a chance to show everything he could do. As good as Hitchcock?
I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots would love to have Tebucky Jones further along,
especially because of the height issue. Jones, at 6-2, 216 pounds,
would have matched up well against a McCaffrey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tebucky's play is going to be limited,'' said Carroll. ``He's
not quite ready. He needs more time to gain the experience before
he can get out there and play a lot. I think in time he'll be very
effective against the Keyshawn Johnsons and the bigger receivers in
our league.''
</P>
<P>
   Injuries have hampered Jones's progress, and the Patriots are a
little thinner than they'd like to be at the corner spot,
especially considering that Steve Israel has yet to step on the
field. That creates more pressure on the safeties, and Milloy is
going to have his hands full against Shannon Sharpe.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots can't afford to be sloppy with the ball at the
start of the game. Turnovers have been the biggest killer in the
last two meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to play a flawless game,'' said Clay. ``We have to
keep it close.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense has been on the field a lot against Denver; last
year's total was nearly 33 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot has to do with having a running game,'' said Clay.
``That affects the defense completely. Everybody understands that.
We're more committed to the running game this year, so they say.
We'll see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Clay offers no bold statements or predictions for Monday or the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just play the game and let our talents take over,'' he said.
``If we do that, it'll be fun.''

SLUGGER TIES ONE ON WITH THE BABE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ When Babe Ruth hit No. 60 on Sept. 30, 1927, he is
alleged to have said, ``60! Let's see some (expletive) top that!''
</P>
<P>
   As we know, Roger Maris hit 61 in 1961. Now the 60 Club has a
third member, and along with that number there is another chilling
numeral _ 141.
</P>
<P>
   That's how many games the St. Louis Cardinals have played. Mark
McGwire has 60 home runs before Labor Day. Let's see some
(expletive) top that.
</P>
<P>
   So tell me, do you think McGwire, who is hitting a home run
every 7.4 times up this year (and one every 8.2 times up since the
beginning of the 1995 season), might be able to hit two home runs
in the final 21 games of the season?
</P>
<P>
   More to the point: Is 70 worth discussing?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a nice number,'' McGwire said at the tail end of a
free-wheeling postgame press conference Saturday. ``But it's a long
way away.''
</P>
<P>
   He hit No. 60 in his first time up Saturday. John Mabry was on
first. A Fernando Valenzuela knockoff by the name of Dennis Reyes
was on the mound. The count was 2 and 0.
</P>
<P>
   At that point in the series, McGwire had seen 18 pitches from
three Cincinnati pitchers. He had swung at eight and had put only
one in play, an altitudinous first-inning fly ball to right on
Friday night. It was clear that the Reds were going to play fair.
Yes, Pete Harnisch had issued McGwire his 146th walk the night
before, but McGwire could have swung at two of the balls, minimum.
Let's just say they were pitches Sammy Sosa would never have turned
down.
</P>
<P>
   So now it was 2 and 0 and young Mr. Reyes _ neither as savvy nor
as generally accomplished as Harnisch, that's for sure _ had to
come in with a fastball, and McGwire put some decent wood on it. In
contrast to his patented moon shots, this was a plain, ordinary
381-foot fly ball, some 12 to 15 feet fair. It landed perhaps a
dozen rows up in the lower deck (which, however, does have
substantial elevation). It was hardly a Ruthian shot. It was,
frankly, more along the lines of a typical Roger Maris home run.
</P>
<P>
   These historical names are the only proper references for Mark
McGwire and his home runs. No offense to Sosa, but he really is the
Other Guy in this scenario. Sammy is going to hit 60-whatever, and
McGwire will be the story, because the No. 1 angle is Mark McGwire
vs. two baseball ghosts named Ruth and Maris.
</P>
<P>
   The pleasant story behind the story here is that the Reds are
giving McGwire a chance to hit. He followed his home run Saturday
with three swinging strikeouts, the third of which, in the seventh
inning, came with men on second and third and, therefore, first
base open. Cincinnati manager Jack McKeon brought in righthander
John Hudek in place of lefthander Mike Remlinger, and Hudek didn't
mess around, fanning McGwire on a full count.
</P>
<P>
   The story behind the story behind the story is that the
cigar-chomping McKeon has a sense of humor. Consider, for example,
his response to the question as to why he pitched to McGwire in the
spot when he had refused to pitch to him in similar situations
earlier in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought about walking him,'' McKeon said, ``but I also
thought about all those phone calls on my voice mail calling me the
Heel of America. I thought I could aid the healing process and do
something good for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wouldn't it be nice if that's all it took?'' smiled McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   More bookkeeping: McGwire has now hit 30 home runs at home and
30 on the road. He has now hit 11 on Saturdays. He has now hit nine
in the first inning. He has now hit 24 with one man on. He has now
hit 19 with one out, as opposed to 20 with two out and 21 with none
out. He has now hit 15 in the day and 45 at night. He has now hit
12 off lefthanders and 48 off righties.
</P>
<P>
   He has done all this and we've still got three weeks to go.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire knows he is now tethered to something bigger than
himself, and he is grappling with ways to cope. The Ruth queries
and the Maris queries keep coming, just as the Lou Gehrig questions
kept coming for Cal Ripken three years ago. It forces a man to look
outside himself. It is easy to see how it could become
overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable; what can you say?'' said McGwire, when
asked if he now had any sense what it might have been like to be
Babe Ruth in 1927. ``I play this game because I love it, and it
just happens to be America's pastime.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is no longer true. But we have arrived at the
beginning of a football season with more attention being focused on
baseball than at any time in the past three decades, and it's all
because of Messrs. McGwire and Sosa. Mark McGwire is very much in
tune with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I truly believe that what we are doing is helping to bring
baseball back,'' he maintained. ``The reception I'm getting all
across the country is unbelievable. I've run into fans on the
street who said that they had turned on baseball after the strike
because of what we did to it, but that now they're excited about
baseball again. All I can say is thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   With a staggering 209 home runs in the past four seasons,
McGwire is, on the field, truly the Babe Ruth of our time. But
that's where it ends. The times are different. The challenges are
different. The only thing that hasn't changed is the sense of
accomplishment, and that's where McGwire sees the links between the
two great Yankee sluggers of the past.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire on Maris: ``I can only imagine what he went through in
New York City. I truly believe he's up there watching.'
</P>
<P>
   McGwire on the Bambino: ``You are almost speechless when people
put your name beside his. ... Hopefully, some day when I pass away,
I get to meet him and then I can really, truly find out what he was
really like.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, Mark, here's what will happen. The Babe will say, ``I never
thought any SOB would ever outslug me.'' And then he'll say, ``Put
yer money away, kid. I'm buyin' tonight!''

FAN SWINGS A DEAL FOR BALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ His name is Deni Allen, and nobody should be
surprised if the St. Louis Rams give the 22-year-old member of
their marketing staff a day off sometime soon, even though the NFL
season begins Sunday. Allen will be spending that day at Busch
Stadium, not the Trans World Dome, taking batting practice with the
Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Allen earned such a privilege Saturday by capturing the ball
that Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire hit into the left-field
bleachers for his 60th home run, tying him with Babe Ruth and
putting him within one homer of Roger Maris's record.
</P>
<P>
   The ball, which Allen grabbed after it had bounced around among
the fans in the first inning of St. Louis's 7-0 win over the
Cincinnati Reds, may be worth serious money to sports memorabilia
collectors, but Allen has other plans for it. He is going to give
it to McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   What does he want in return?
</P>
<P>
   ``A few season tickets for my family,'' said Allen, ``and a
chance to have batting practice with the Cardinals.''
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, the Cardinals agreed to give Allen two season
tickets for 1999, some bats, hats, and autographed balls _ plus a
round of batting practice before a game at Busch Stadium later in
the season. All for the ball McGwire hit for No. 60.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it's his ball,'' said Allen, who was raised in
nearby Ozark, Mo. ``It's the only thing to do for baseball right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire hit five home runs over the past week, and in each case
he has gotten the ball back from a fan, without having to pay a
huge price. All have offered the ball back for merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the same thing happens with 61,'' said McGwire. ``Ball
No. 62 belongs in Cooperstown.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's home run traveled 381 feet to the upper deck down the
left-field line. Allen had come to the game with his grandparents
and had seats farther over in left-center. But with McGwire due to
bat, Allen said, he began to drift toward what he considered a
better position down the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drift'' isn't the right word. Stadium security was stationed
in left to keep wanderers from entering the ``Promised Land,''
which the area in the left-field stands at Busch Stadium is
sometimes called. Guards stopped Allen once. But he was persistent
and made it through on his second attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``After (John) Mabry got his hit,'' said Allen, referring to the
batter preceding McGwire in the lineup, ``I decided I had to run
and find a place. I jumped over two seats. I walked down and
around. Some guy ran me out. He was just trying to do his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball was hit, and I don't remember much after that. I went
for it, I got a few punches and some kicks. But I got the ball and
just tucked it away in my pocket. I got it off the bounce. In every
home run highlight, the first guy never catches it. I knew that. I
waited for the bounce and I somehow came up with the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Will Allen be in the bleachers Sunday looking for No. 62?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry,'' he said. ``I have to work the Rams game.''

 &HT;    Braves let lead, win slip away in eighth
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Midway through a lost Labor Day weekend, the Braves
have done nothing to help themselves extend the league's best
record or hurt the Mets' postseason hopes. This, Chipper Jones
knows, is not a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned,'' Jones said after Atlanta's disturbing 5-4
loss Saturday. Tony Phillips' second homer of the year, a two-out,
two-run shot off Rudy Seanez in the eighth, sent the Braves to
their third straight defeat and fifth in six games. ``This isn't
the way you should be playing in September. ... We're going to be
sitting at home on October 4th or 5th.''
</P>
<P>
   That would mean a first-round exit in the National League
playoffs. But then, the Braves have done little lately to suggest
they'll still be playing deep into October.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're helping the Mets stay in it,'' Jones said of the NL
wild-card race. ``It's the same old thing every day, not doing the
little things. We had one opportunity to turn a double play and
didn't. Had second and third, one out, didn't score. Those two
things cost us two runs, at least two runs. Cost us a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Andruw Jones hit his 26th homer in the fifth inning but Braves
starter Kevin Millwood gave up a two-out infield single to Edgardo
Alfonzo in the bottom half, then a two-run homer to John Olerud.
``Right down the middle,'' Millwood said. ``You can't do that to
him.''
</P>
<P>
   When Javy Lopez singled off Bobby Jones to tie it in the sixth,
and Greg Colbrunn hit a two-run double, Atlanta had a 4-2 lead and
men at second and third with one out. But Tony Graffanino (now
hitless in his last 12 at-bats) struck out for the second of three
times Saturday, and Millwood took a called third strike.
</P>
<P>
   With Mets on first and third in the seventh and one out, Mike
Piazza was forced at second but came in with both hands raised.
When Ozzie Guillen's throw hit Piazza's hand, the relay was in the
dirt, allowing Olerud to score.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bobby Cox said, ``We played very well all day long. Then
to lose it like that. But that's what happens when you walk a guy
with two out. You're always going to get burned.''

 &HT;    Falcons assured as debut arrives
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE _ Free safety Eugene Robinson is old by NFL standards
and slower than a few years ago. But when the Atlanta Falcons
signed Robinson during the offseason, they were counting on him
bringing experience and a new attitude from the Green Bay Packers.
</P>
<P>
   When Robinson, 35, begins talking about Atlanta's season opener
today at Carolina, he sounds as if his team is playing for a high
school championship instead of NFC West rivals.
</P>
<P>
   It's a mindset Falcons officials hope is contagious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever you want to call it, you've got to be so confident
when you step out on the field,'' Robinson said. ``That's the
difference between making a play and not making a play. There's a
domino effect; everybody is trying to make a play and get their
name in the paper. I see that here.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta rebounded from a 1-7 start under new coach Dan Reeves
last year to win six of its final eight. The question: Was it a
fluke?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to see if the 6-2 was for real or fake,'' Robinson
said. ``From all indications, it's for real. These guys are playing
to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's game should provide a nice barometer.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons are 0-3 in Ericsson Stadium, lost twice last year to
the Panthers and have lost 11 road openers in a row.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of attention will be paid to right tackle Ephraim Salaam,
the only rookie in Atlanta's starting lineup. Salaam will try to
protect quarterback Chris Chandler, who signed a new contract on
Saturday. The Falcons have to slow Carolina tight end Wesley Walls
and the Panthers' new West Coast passing offense.
</P>
<P>
   But where there was doubt, even confusion, before last year's
opener, players and coaches say there is confidence and
understanding this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys expect to win, and that's a big difference from hoping
you win,'' Reeves said. ``(Players are) looking to make plays to
win games rather than worrying about making plays to cost you a
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we beat New Orleans and St. Louis, but if we're
going to compete in this division ... we've got to beat teams
people expect to be above us, and this is one of those teams.''

 &HT;    The guy's always open
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the Atlanta Falcons never saw Wesley Walls again, it would be
fine with them. Unfortunately, they're likely to see plenty of
Carolina's tight end this afternoon, because whenever the team he's
on plays Atlanta, Walls tends to do real damage to the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   In last year's home opener, John Kasay kicked three
fourth-quarter field goals _ including a 39-yarder as time expired
_ to drive a stake through Atlanta's heart, 9-6. But Walls first
lined up the stake and pounded on it repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-5, 250-pounder had a career-high seven catches for a
career-high 147 yards that afternoon, and when it looked as if
Falcons strong safety William White was going to intercept a pass
with just 1:38 left, only to tip the ball instead, Walls caught it
for a 14-yard gain.
</P>
<P>
   Walls caught five passes in the fourth quarter for 105 yards; it
was no surprise. He had 58 receptions last year for 746 yards and
six touchdowns and was the Pro Bowl starter for the second year in
a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you play Carolina, you have to be cognizant of Wesley
Walls,'' said Rich Brooks, Atlanta assistant head coach and
defensive coordinator. ``He's an outstanding receiver; he makes
plays on everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The nine-year veteran had punished the Falcons before. In his
first game with Carolina, the 1996 season opener in Charlotte, he
caught four passes for 32 yards and a TD in a 29-6 win over
Atlanta. When he was with the Saints, he caught six passes for 61
yards and a TD, and Atlanta needed overtime to beat New Orleans
early in 1995. In '94, his first year with the Saints after
spending five seasons with San Francisco, Walls made a diving
21-yard TD catch in a 29-20 New Orleans win.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's their go-to guy. Even if he's covered, they're going to
look for him,'' said the Falcons' White (5-10, 205), who often will
try to cover the bigger Walls. ``He's their Jerry Rice. He's very
smart, and a lot of times he has an option (to break his route) if
he sees something in the defense. People talk about how slippery he
is, but he's got great hands. And he can gain ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Walls has kind of come out of nowhere several times.
</P>
<P>
   He was a quarterback for three years and then a fullback in high
school. At the University of Mississippi, he was a defensive end
for three years and then played two ways as a senior, at outside
linebacker and tight end.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers made him a second-round draft choice in 1989, but he
had just 11 catches for 67 yards and a TD in three years, playing
more as a deep snapper. He spent '92 and '93 on injured reserve
before becoming a free agent and signing with New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   His first year with the Saints, he caught 38 passes for 406
yards in '94. Then in '95, he caught 57 passes for 694 yards and
four TDs, and in two seasons in Carolina, he has caught 119 passes
for 1,459 yards and 16 TDs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got great feel and knowledge,'' Brooks said, ``and he
just kind of wiggles his way into an open seam and catches
everything thrown to him. He's really hurt us.''

 &HT;    One down, two to go!
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ On a hot, marvelous afternoon here for baseball,
Mark McGwire put himself one big swing away from Roger Maris and
right along side baseball's greatest legend.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, like almost everyone else who has ever picked up a bat
and ball, holds a special place for Babe Ruth. He hit his 60th home
run of the season Saturday to tie the Bambino on a 2-0 pitch in the
first inning, belting a fastball from Cincinnati's Dennis Reyes
into the left-field seats. A mad scramble for the ball ensued,
Busch Stadium exploded and McGwire made another of his now familiar
curtain calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could go back in time and meet him,'' McGwire said of
Ruth. ``When I pass away, I want to meet him and find out what he
was really like.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, McGwire needs just one more homer to tie Maris
and two to break what has been a record for 37 years. He had three
chances after his homer Saturday in the Cardinals' 7-0 win over the
Reds, striking out all three times. But in no way did thatdampen
McGwire's spirits.
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards, he held a 45-minute press conference under the
stands in right field. Some of the 47,994 on hand for the game
stuck around to listen, as his face and words were put on the big
overhead screen in center field. McGwire was unaware of that until
he heard the roar after one of his comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There still here,'' he said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   And they're not going anywhere, nor is the rest of the country
until McGwire hits No. 62. With the Chicago Cubs in Pittsburgh
Saturday night and Sammy Sosa going into the game with 57 homers,
the chase picks up again this afternoon for McGwire, as the Fox
network has decided to televise the game nationally and has changed
the game time to 4:10 p.m., allowing the network to get to 80
percent of the country's television markets.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire now has five home runs in September, and his homer
Saturday was his first against the Reds this season. He now has hit
homers against every team in the league. Except for the first
at-bat Saturday, the Reds have done an excellent job against him
these last two games.
</P>
<P>
   Their only fault was Reyes falling behind McGwire two balls in
the count. Reyes then came back with a fastball in, and McGwire hit
it 380 feet, just the 17th of his 60 homers to travel less than 400
feet. The homer came in the Cardinals' 142nd game. Ruth hit No. 60
on the final day of the 154-game season in 1927.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't a bad pitch,'' Reyes said. ``I was down 2-0 in the
count and had to throw a strike.''
</P>
<P>
   But asked where he thought the pitch should have been thrown,
Reds manager Jack McKeon said, ``Out of the strikezone.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's second at-bat came in the second, and he had trouble
with three straight curveballs from Reyes, swinging at only the
third one. He then faced reliever Mike Remlinger in the fifth,
taking a strike and was unable to catch up with the last two
fastballs.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a surprise in the seventh. The Cardinals had runners
at second and third and one out, and this seemed to be a perfect
situation to walk McGwire, with the Reds down 5-0. But McKeon, who
would have probably had to have an army escort him back to the
hotel if he walked McGwire, brought in right-hander John Hudek to
pitch to McGwire. ``I knew Hudek would challenge him,'' McKeon
said. Hudek worked the count full. McGwire fouled off a fastball.
Hudek came back with another fastball and McGwire went down
swinging, saying later, ``On my last three at-bats I was pitched
very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, McGwire will be facing Cincinnati's most talented
pitcher today in right-hander Brett Tomko. McGwire has faced Tomko
six times this season, going 2-for-5 with a walk and no homers.
Tomko, however, has said recently that he wouldn't mind giving up
the homer that either ties or breaks the record.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he is just one homer away from tying the record,
McGwire said he isn't about to change anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think about it and you try to put it out of your mind,''
McGwire said. ``I'm trying to simplify it, the only thing I can do
is swing the bat.''
</P>
<P>
   And make history.

   Turning (on) Gray
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis general manager Bill Polian has started rebuilding
the Colts in his image, and the latest victim is cornerback Carlton
Gray. The five-year pro was demoted to a backup role Wednesday and
then cut Thursday when he took his complaints public. Early in the
free-agency period, Polian signed cornerback Jeff Burris, whom he
had scouted while in Buffalo. In July, he traded for corner Tyrone
Poole, a player he selected in the first round of Carolina's
inaugural draft. Secondary coach George Catavolos tried to placate
Gray by pointing out that he'd still log 60 percent to 70 percent
playing time in the ``nickel'' package, but the veteran wasn't
buying it. ``It was obvious this was going to happen, because they
want their own guys in there,'' said Gray, who averaged 14 starts
the last four seasons. The Giants, who lost corner Jason Sehorn for
the year, already have called agent Marvin Demoff about Gray.
Minnesota, New England and Philadelphia also are interested.
</P>
<P>
   Myles to go
</P>
<P>
   There were 11 linebackers taken before former Nevada star
DeShone Myles, but Seattle might have gotten a bargain in the
fourth-rounder. Of the six inside linebackers selected ahead of
him, only Takeo Spikes of Cincinnati will start today. But Myles
could move into a starting spot before any of the others _ Sam
Cowart (Buffalo), Brian Simmons (Cincinnati), Jermiah Trotter
(Philadelphia), Jamie Duncan (Tampa Bay) and Anthony Simmons
(Seattle). ``He just has a great feel for the ball,'' Seahawks
coordinator Greg McMakin said. So great, in fact, that McMakin last
week moved Anthony Simmons to an outside spot and could soon
replace starter Dean Wells with Myles.

<P>
   Good Will Wolford
</P>
<P>
   When Steelers coach Bill Cowher shuffled his offensive line last
week and moved left guard Will Wolford to left tackle, the 13-year
veteran could have balked and asked for more money. Wolford's
contract stipulated he can earn as much as $400,000 in incentives
if moved back to tackle, where he earned three Pro Bowl berths in
Buffalo (1990 and '92) and Indianapolis ('95). But he and agent
Ralph Cindrich agreed to waive the clause for this season, in part
to help the Steelers with salary cap problems. Look for Pittsburgh,
which is trying to negotiate extensions with tight end Mark
Bruener, corner Carnell Lake and free safety Darren Perry, to
reward Wolford at season's end.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles lure
</P>
<P>
   After the league awards the Cleveland expansion franchise
Tuesday, attention will turn to adding a 32nd team. The focus is on
Los Angeles and Houston. But because the NFL might not be able to
get a publicly financed stadium in L.A., Houston could have an
edge. There remain rumblings that Al Davis wants to move the
Raiders back to the potentially lucrative Los Angeles market. ``But
they hate him as much (in Los Angeles) as the fans do in Oakland,''
league attorney Frank Rothman said.
</P>
<P>
   Ragged Raiders
</P>
<P>
   An Oakland defense that finished last in 1997 still is
scrambling to find help at end and outside linebacker. Terry
Wooden, signed Wednesday, immediately was installed as the starting
strong-side linebacker. Richard Harvey, acquired Monday, is a good
bet to unseat James Folston on the weak side.
</P>
<P>
   The grapevine
</P>
<P>
   If the Al Lerner-Carmen Policy group is awarded the Cleveland
expansion franchise, look for San Francisco personnel director
Vinny Cerrato to get the same title with the Browns. ... Kansas
City defensive tackle Dan Williams, the only veteran holdout left
in the league, has vowed he won't return to the Chiefs. ...
Linebacker Eddie Robinson, signed by the Oilers after being cut by
Jacksonville, has bumped leading tackler Barron Wortham from the
starting lineup. ... Because he wants a more physical runner,
Baltimore coach Ted Marchibroda will start Errict Rhett at tailback
over Jay Graham.

 &HT;    Week 1: Falcons vs. Carolina
 &HT;    BY Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Falcons (0-0) vs.Carolina (0-0)
</P>
<P>
   1:01 p.m., Ericsson Stadium, Charlotte;
</P>
<P>
   Fox/Channel 5 and 640-AM, 105.7 FM, 96.1 FM
</P>
<P>
   Falcons coach Dan Reeves was harping on turnovers in the
preseason, and it's easy to see why. Atlanta finished 3-13 in 1996,
when its turnover differential was minus-18. But last year, the
Falcons were plus-4 in turnover differential and finished 7-9.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons did not get a turnover during the preseason until
the final game, when safety Eugene Robinson had an interception and
recovered a fumble against Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina, meanwhile, had a minus-17 turnover differential last
year, while compiling a 7-9 record. In the franchise's three-year
history, it has a 25-6 regular-season record when the team is even
or better in turnover differential and a 1-16 record with a
negative turnover differential.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Panthers were minus-1 in the preseason, it's worth
noting that quarterback Kerry Collins did not throw an
interception. He completed 32 of 55 passes (58.2 percent) for 337
yards and two touchdowns in the Panthers' new West Coast offense.
Backup Steve Beuerlein completed 42 of 68 passes (61.8) for 583
yards, four TDs and no interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   When the Panthers made it to the NFC Championship game after the
1996 season, a stout run defense had a lot to do with it. But in
dropping from 12-4 in 1996 to 7-9 last year, Carolina's 22nd-ranked
run defense _ or lack thereof _ took a lot of the blame. The
Panthers gave up yardage totals of 198, 219, 158, 160, 218 and 147
in games last season.
</P>
<P>
   But that porous run defense didn't apply against the Falcons in
the two meetings between the NFC West teams. Atlanta managed 48 and
68 yards _ a 2.3-yard average _ in two losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the real keys in the ballgame is going to be
who can run the football,'' Falcons coach Dan Reeves said. ``Both
teams have struggled stopping the run in the preseason. And we've
had more success running the ball in the preseason than Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   Carolina has given up 143 yards per game in the preseason. The
Falcons are averaging 126.3 yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina tried to address its run defense by acquiring defensive
tackle Sean Gilbert and drafting defenders Jason Peter, Chuck Wiley
and Mitch Marrow. Wiley and Marrow, however, are out for the season
after being placed on injured reserve.

 &HT;    A big bid by `Little Man'
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jacksonville tailback James Stewart should have spent the first
three years of his career with cotton balls stuffed in his ears and
a rear-view mirror glued to his helmet.
</P>
<P>
   He was battered constantly by the verbal barbs of coach Tom
Coughlin, and he challenged the Jaguars' penchant for annually
acquiring players to compete for his job.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, a former Tennessee star nicknamed ``Little Man,'' was
one of the Jaguars' first-round picks in their inaugural 1995
draft, and unwittingly became the symbol for a running game that
has grown progressively worse _ 16th in 1995, 17th in '96 and 18th
last year.
</P>
<P>
   In this fourth season, however, ``Little Man'' has become ``The
Man'' for a Jaguars team with Super Bowl dreams. During preseason,
when he gained 197 yards on 38 carries, Stewart matured into the
kind of back who finally can provide balance to an offense that too
often has relied on the arm of Mark Brunell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think James realized he was at a crossroads in his career,''
agent Pat Dye Jr. said. ``It wasn't as if the organization didn't
like him, but they kept bringing in backs every year. No matter
what they were saying, there was always a feeling they weren't
completely sold on James. After a while, the hints aren't so subtle
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, club officials were about as understated as a
sledgehammer this spring when they warned Stewart and Dye that
Coughlin planned to select a tailback in the first round. After
failing in attempts to move up and take Penn State's Curtis Enis,
the Jags took Florida standout Fred Taylor with the ninth overall
choice, then grabbed Iowa speedster Tavian Banks in the fourth
round.
</P>
<P>
   For the soft-spoken Stewart, it was nothing new. His lofty draft
status aside, Jaguars officials never regarded him in previous
seasons as the answer to their tailback questions and brought in an
annual challenger: Vaughn Dunbar in 1995, Natrone Means in 1996 and
'97 and now Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Despite being the Jaguars' career leader in rushing
yards and touchdowns, Stewart has averaged only 154.3 carries per
season. That should change this year, when he figures to get about
300 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with minicamps, when his toughness and resolve were
obvious, Stewart did more than just fend off his latest
challengers. ``He blew them away,'' Brunell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they brought in (Taylor) and all the talk started
focusing on him,'' Stewart said, ``it was nothing new to me. (It's)
happened every year. People say I responded different this time,
but I didn't think so. I've always just tried to control the things
I had some say-so on. The other stuff, I can't control.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, 26, conceded he might have been victimized early in his
career by the pressure of being a first-rounder and an immediate
high-profile personality in a city with just one professional
sports franchise. A subpar offensive line and Coughlin's frequent
criticism of his play also contributed to Stewart's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a kid from a small town (Morristown, Tenn.) suddenly
thrust into the limelight with a demanding coach,'' Dye said. ``He
took things personally. He lost some confidence and went into a
shell there for a while. The upside is it made him tougher
mentally, and he's so confident now of his standing with his team
and the respect of his teammates.''
</P>
<P>
   A contract extension that doubled his 1998 compensation _ it
will pay Stewart nearly $2 million next year _ offers tangible
evidence of management's newfound respect for the fourth-year
veteran. Stewart plans to provide instant dividends on the
investment, and then some.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are any more doubters,'' he said, ``we're going to
take care of them.''

 &HT;    Geoff Bodine may be moving
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Winston Cup ``silly season,'' where the rumor mill heats up,
is under way. Jim Mattei, owner of Mattei Motorsports, said driver
Geoff Bodine will finish the current season with the team and might
remain in the future. But he also is considering other options.
``During the past month, we have made great strides as a team,
which has allowed us to learn a great deal about our operation,''
Mattei said. ``I anticipate being able to announce our plans for
the next year within the next 30 days.'' Bodine ranks 32nd in the
Winston Cup points standings.
</P>
<P>
   First and third
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gordon might be first in the Winston Cup points standings,
but he's only third in the World Driver Rankings. He moved ahead of
Formula One's Mika Hakkinen, who spun out of last week's Belgian
Grand Prix. F1's Michael Schumacher and CART's Alex Zanardi are
ranked 1-2.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Wallace has made it official. He will leave the No. 81
Square D team of owner Filbert Martocci after the season and move
to Andy Petree Racing, joining Ken Schrader to form a two-car team.
.. Steve Hmiel was released earlier this week as general manager of
Jack Roush's two-team operation in Liberty, N.C. Hmiel managed the
facility that prepares the cars forKevin Lepage and Johnny Benson.
He has been replaced by Harry McMullen.

</P>
<P>
   Sadler opts out
</P>
<P>
   Elliott Sadler had been pointing to Saturday's Busch Dura-Lube
200, hoping to equal or better his fifth place in March. But he
couldn't get back fast enough to run with the Winston Cup teams.
``The Southern 500 is a premier race, and Winston Cup is a
different world out there. And that's why we've chosen to run it,''
Sadler said. ``I'm not taking anything away from the Busch series;
it's No. 1.Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Matt Kenseth easily are the series
statistical leaders. Earnhardt is first in points (3,269) and
Kenseth second (3,1274); Earnhardt leads in money, $598,160 to
Kenseth's $533,220. ... Stat of the Week: Randy LaJoie's victory in
last year's Dura-Lube was the only one by a Busch Series regular
ever in the fall Darlington event. CRAFTSMAN TRUCKS
</P>
<P>
   Bliss moving on
</P>
<P>
   Mike Bliss won't be back in 1999, ending a four-year
relationship with ASE Racing.``The team and I came to an agreement
that things weren't working out the way we had hoped. The chemistry
just isn't there,'' Bliss said. ``It's time to move on with my
career.'' The season has been up and down for Bliss. He's won three
poles, has 10 top-five finishes and 15 top-10s. ``I hope we can get
a few more wins together before the season is over,'' said Bliss,
who finished second last week at Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   Rolling along
</P>
<P>
   Rookie of the year candidate Greg Biffle has been on a
roller-coaster ride this year. He started the season with a fifth
at Disney, then was fourth at Homestead before finishing 36th in
Phoenix. While he has had five top-fives and eight top-10s in 19
races, he also has finished 17th or worse 11 times. It's not all
bad, however. He leads Andy Houston by 12 points in the race for
rookie of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly
</P>
<P>
   At the Kroger 225 in Louisville, Tony Raines became the seventh
different winner. That's one short of the season record set in
1997...Fords finished 1-2 in Louisville after failing to win at the
.438-mile oval in three previous attempts.

 &HT;    A tough track to love
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Darlington, S.C. -- IIt's called the track ``Too Tough to
Tame'', ``The Lady in Black.'' The men who have raced here have
called it much worse, cursed it and lost sleep over it.
</P>
<P>
   It's Darlington Raceway, the track they love to hate. It's 1.366
miles of egg-shaped asphalt, which this time of year tests the best
NASCAR can offer in the Southern 500.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, drivers like Fireball Roberts, Joe Weatherly,
David Pearson and Cale Yarborough made reputations for mastering
the track, whose tire-eating surface and different-shaped corners
made it a run like no other.
</P>
<P>
   And today it will be up to its usual tricks and treats in the
Pepsi Southern 500.
</P>
<P>
   For pole winner Dale Jarrett it's a trip down memory lane. He's
been coming here for over 30 years, tracing the tire tracks of his
father, and putting down a few of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly that day in 1965 when dad was able to win the
Southern 500, I'm not even asking to win it by 14 laps,'' Jarrett
said. ``I'll let most people stay on the lead lap if I can win it.
It was just a special day.
</P>
<P>
   Also, knowing how well David Pearson got around here, watching
his style, and how he went about winning races here. I think all of
that has helped me. Plus, the history and prestige of this race
means a lot to me.''
</P>
<P>
   It's where Bill Elliott won the first Winston Million in 1985,
holding off Cale Yarborough by .06 seconds. It's where Pearson most
shined, holding the record for most victories with 10.
</P>
<P>
   And it's where the entire field will be tested today.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is real history here,'' Jeremy Mayfield said. ``With a
shape like it has, you have to compromise your setup. Your are
either really good in turns one and two or three and four. There's
no way you can be good at both ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darlington is the one place I can remember older drivers
talking like it was alive. You hear them talk about other tracks
and saying, 'That place' or 'that track'. With Darlington, you hear
them talk about 'she and her,' those kinds of terms. That's what
sets it apart from all the others.''
</P>
<P>
   What it isn't is a fun track. The racing groove is narrow and
the corners are different than most tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a fine line between racing against the competition and
the track,'' said Derrike Cope. ``You have to separate the two. You
obviously have to play strategy and watch where the leaders are,
and what they're doing and be concerned. But, at the same time, you
really have to watch the track and drive within your means.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your car isn't good enough, it can be a short day. And if
you get down laps, it can be a shorter day yet. That's just the way
Darlington is, and what makes it interesting.''

 &HT;    No place like home
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a bad night. The house was dark and lonely. Most of the
windows lacked draperies _ and, yes, even heavyweight champions
with 200 gated acres and elaborate security systems get paranoid
that somebody is peeking inside.
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all, there was nothing to eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``First I was kind of nervous, being in that big ol' house by my
doggone self,'' Evander Holyfield said of the new
54,000-square-foot mansion on his estate in Fayette County. ``Then
I walk into the kitchen and there's no food. There I am, standing
in front of these two big empty refrigerators, thinking, `How come
you got all this money and you ain't got no food in your
refrigerator?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield is a guest in his own hometown. In his own house. He
opted to move his training camp for the Sept. 19 title defense at
the Georgia Dome against Vaughn Bean from Houston to Atlanta. But
while his family resides in an older, relatively modest home on the
property, Holyfield spends nap times and evenings at the
not-quite-complete, mostly unfurnished, $18 million (so far) palace
next door.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield built a full boxing gym and weight room on the grounds
a few years back with the idea of holding prefight camps at home.
But phone calls, children tugging on his shirt and unforeseen
obligations convinced him to continue his preparations in Houston,
where he owns a home and has trained for most of his professional
career.
</P>
<P>
   Because Holyfield shares in promotional responsibilities on the
Bean fight and a significant portion of the champion's purse is
tied to attendance, he felt compelled to train at home for the last
four weeks. The move will allow him to conduct public workouts, the
first of which is scheduled for noon Wednesday at CNN Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm older now and more mature, so I can handle the
distractions better,'' he said. ``If I need my rest, I can get
it.''
</P>
<P>
   That is made easier by Holyfield's sleeping arrangements. He and
longtime fitness trainer Tim Hallmark snooze in guest rooms, which
are furnished while most others, including the master bedroom,
remain unequipped. The Holyfields had hoped to move in a year ago,
but have been delayed by construction problems. Most of the
unfinished work relates to either landscaping or electrical.
</P>
<P>
   ``That lake looks low. Must have a leak,'' Holyfield said from
his view on a balcony.
</P>
<P>
   And it seems the entire structure had to be rewired after the
original electricians, Holyfield said, used wiring more conducive
to a 3,000-square foot home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some (new) professional electricians in and they said,
`Your house is going to catch on fire,' '' Holyfield said.
</P>
<P>
   That little mistake cost Holyfield between $300,000 and
$400,000. The current $18 million tab does not include furniture,
balls for the bowling alley, movies for the home theater or the
$250,000 in new Cybex equipment Holyfield purchased for a second
weight room _ just to save him a walk to his gym 200 yards away.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all this equipment, my kids will have no reason not to
exercise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, mostly what Holyfield wants from the three of his seven
children living on the property _ a fourth is on the way any day
now _ is quiet. He spends little time at the other house, other
than for meals.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has the phone number at the new home, and Janice
Holyfield reaches her husband by intercom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phone rings all the time (at the old home),'' Holyfield
said. ``I can't tell people not to call. People call for Janice or
the business. I go upstairs and I can still hear the phone, even
when it's turned off in my room. When I'm in the new house, it's
just peaceful. I mean, I don't hear nothing. I don't hear any more
than I want to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield did answer one call the other day. While giving a tour
to two visitors, the phone rang in the mansion's elevator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello?'' Holyfield said. After a pause, he told the caller,
``You dialed the wrong number.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield's first night there two weeks ago was more
intimidating than he expected. He later asked Hallmark to stay down
the hall, though in different wings, to provide some company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got lost the first morning,'' Hallmark said. ``I made a
wrong turn and didn't know where I was. I'm a little more used to
it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Brooks, one of his boxing trainers, said, ``When you think
about it, it's kind of funny, just him and Tim in that big house.
Tim told me he felt like he had to take a shower before going to
bed because everything was so new. He didn't want to ruffle the
sheets.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield's daily routine here has not changed much. He rises
for a 5:30 a.m. boxing workout, has breakfast, takes a nap, hits
the weight room in the afternoon, rests, then sometimes runs in the
evening.
</P>
<P>
   The three mansion kitchens remain unstocked, but Holyfield has
smuggled in some juice and potato chips.
</P>
<P>
   He has no plans to move in until the house is completed and
furnished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want my house to be like a train station, people going
in and out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, it's more like a ghost town with all the extras.

 &HT;    Manning at ease in spotlight
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Like a pair of giant doormen, the
larger-than-life billboards of tailback Marshall Faulk and free
safety Jason Belser will silently greet a sellout crowd as it files
into the RCA Dome for today's regular-season opener against the
Miami Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   But even the two Indianapolis veterans, both surprised that
their likenesses were selected for the posters that hang above the
Capitol Avenue entrance, acknowledged they can't take credit for
the Colts' first opening-day full house since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, we all know who they're coming to see,'' Faulk said,
without a hint of envy.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, civic leaders staged a parade early this morning to
honor the Colts _ the kind usually reserved here for Indianapolis
500 drivers _ and a large crowd was expected to herald the arrival
of Peyton Manning, the man anointed the city's latest football
savior.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night at St. Elmo Steak House, an entire table of
patrons wore Colts jerseys with Manning's new No. 18 on the front.
A few feet away, fans from Knoxville, here for the NFL debut of the
Tennessee Volunteers' greatest all-time player, preferred orange
mesh shirts with the more familiar No. 16.
</P>
<P>
   And so, the Peyton Manning era begins. And while Manning mania
isn't quite epidemic yet, it has provided a pulse in an area that
favors point guards over pinpoint passers.
</P>
<P>
   The moribund franchise, rumored as recently as a year ago to be
primed for relocation to Cleveland, sold 3,500 more season tickets
than in 1997. Marketing and advertising revenues have in- creased
dramatically. Owner Jim Irsay, whose struggling team had the NFL's
lowest stadium-generated revenue, gained concessions and a more
favorable lease agreement from the city. The owner of a downtown
sporting-goods store estimated sales of Colts apparel had more than
doubled over last year.
</P>
<P>
   All of that even before Manning, a $42.6 million investment, has
appeared in his first commercial.
</P>
<P>
   That comes next month, when Hoosiers will see grainy celluloid
of a gangly, 7-year-old Manning tossing a football with his
brothers. The commercial is part of his first local endorsement
deal, with St. Vincent's Hospital, and will help pitch ``Peyton's
Playbook,'' a collection of health advice and success tips for
kids.
</P>
<P>
   But the intentionally low profile, which is equal parts respect
for his older teammates and the realization that he has yet to
complete his first regular-season pass, hasn't kept the spotlight
from focusing on Manning. This city's nickname may be Nap Town, but
it has awakened to the reality that, for the first time since
tailback Eric Dickerson abandoned it in 1991, there is an
honest-to-goodness NFL celebrity in its midst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to think everything was fair game except church and
your doctor's office,'' Manning said.``But then I got elbowed
during a prayer in church by some guy with a shirt (he wanted
autographed). At the hospital, the nurses had me (autograph) my
X-rays. .. I guess anything goes now. For me, hey, I just want to
be one of the guys.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of his 22 years, however, Manning has known that his
name, pedigree and talent for throwing a football would preclude
anonymity. Even while still a prep star at Isidore Newman High
School in New Orleans, his accomplishments fell somewhere between
legendary and mythical.
</P>
<P>
   The unpretentious Manning has handled celebrity with aplomb and
civility. A few weeks ago, San Diego quarterback Ryan Leaf, the No.
2 pick in last year's draft, referred to Manning as ``Perfect
Peyton'' and ``the Golden Boy.'' During a lengthy interview Friday,
Manning refused to be drawn into a verbal battle with Leaf. But it
was obvious that he simmered over the comments and that he's proud
of a reputation that, except for a ballyhooed mooning incident in
college, is clean.
</P>
<P>
   His father, who lost more games as a starter than any other NFL
quarterback, remains one of the game's true gentlemen. Peyton
witnessed ``unbelievable patience'' during Archie Manning's
star-crossed 15-year career. His mother, Olivia, is a
pageant-lovely belle. The great-uncle for whom he is named was a
cotton farmer whose charitable legacy still benefits parts of rural
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Manning is fiercely loyal to the legacy, and it will play well
in this city, a Mason-Dixon straddler that possesses plenty of
Southern wannabe. Whereas Leaf noted that he hopes to follow his
inaugural game with a celebratory trip to Tijuana tonight, Manning
has dinner reservations for his mother, father, girlfriend and
agent at a small restaurant in moderately upscale Broad Ripple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made plenty of mistakes, but at least I've always tried
to do the right thing,'' Manning said quietly. ``I don't know what
a so-called `golden boy' is. I know I've always been under a
microscope since I was a kid, because I'm Archie Manning's son.
Having all that pressure, though, made me a better person. People
always knew who I was, and so they were looking for me to mess up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes that's the best way you learn on the field, to screw
up once. But in life it's tough. Being (Archie's) son, you just got
used to it. And being a quarterback, it was an advantage, because I
had my hero and my mentor right there in my own house.''
</P>
<P>
   Every father dreams of raising a son who is too good to be true,
and Archie Manning said he's been blessed in that regard. Every
team covets a superstar around whom it can market itself, and Irsay
believes Manning should be the centerpiece of a bright future.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a Manning dissenter in Indianapolis could prove
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been groomed for greatness,'' wide receiver Marvin
Harrison said. ``He may be Archie's son, but he's our moon, our
stars, our universe.''
</P>
<P>
   Offensive tackle and former University of Georgia star Adam
Meadows said: ``From the first day, it was his huddle and his
offense. It might be cliche, but he acted like a 10-year veteran
and had everyone's eyes (on him). Maybe someone else is going to
begrudge him the money's he's making or the attention he gets. As
far as I'm concerned, Peyton is the meal-ticket. Anyone who works
as hard as him gets respect.''
</P>
<P>
   He is ``a sponge,'' says quarterbacks coach Bruce Arians, who
has at times been caught off-guard by Manning's insightful
questions about game plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``His mind is like a projector,'' Arians said. ``One time _
that's all it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Manning and his coaches are not naive enough to believe that an
exemplary work ethic will translate into immediate success.
Ironically, the last No. 1 quarterback to start and finish a
victory in his NFL debut was Archie Manning in 1971. It is a league
that chews up rookie quarterbacks and spits them out, and Manning
is the leader of a very young offense.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Miami defense probably will throw everything at
Manning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect that, because I'd do the same thing,'' Colts coach
Jim Mora said. ``But you know, for some reason, I don't stand on
the field this week and think, `Man, we have a rookie quarterback.'
He doesn't act like a rookie quarterback. Now maybe he will
(today), I don't know. But I'm not lying awake at night worrying
about it. I've accepted the fact we're going to have some tough
times. But Peyton is the best we have, and he's only going to keep
getting better.''

   Rice's comeback
</P>
<P>
   He played only 47 snaps last year, didn't get on the field for a
preseason game and, at age 35, is trying to come back from a pair
of major knee surgeries. Little wonder San Francisco wide receiver
Jerry Rice admits to some apprehension about his return today
against the New York Jets. ``I can deal with being rusty,'' Rice
said last week. ``A bigger concern is whether I'll be able to take
a blow on the knee, jump up and run back to the huddle. It's almost
a battle from within. The media has made such a big thing of it
that it starts to get inside your head.'' Rice said the emergence
of Terrell Owens and J.J. Stokes, and the increased use of a
three-wideout alignment, could mean his receptions decline and his
yards-per-catch increase.
</P>
<P>
   The Ironhead tour
</P>
<P>
   Fullback Craig Heyward, released last week by St. Louis, most
likely will wind up in Jacksonville, San Diego or Oakland. Jags
coach Tom Coughlin wants to upgrade from second-year veteran Daimon
Shelton and met with Heyward on Friday. In San Diego, he has
supporters in June Jones and former Falcons running backs coach
Ollie Wilson. In Oakland, former Atlanta personnel man Ken Herock
is making a pitch. ``Hopefully we'll know something by early in the
week,'' agent Jack Mills said. Heyward, who spent some time in the
Duke University weight-management program, is telling teams he is
down to 258 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth agrees
</P>
<P>
   It probably won't help the Arizona Cardinals much in today's
opener against the Dallas Cowboys, but the club finally reached
agreement Saturday afternoon with first-round draft choice Andre
Wadsworth. The former Florida State standout signed a complicated
six-year deal that could pay him as much as $42 million. The
signing bonus is $10.491 million and the Cardinals have, after
three seasons, annual options on each of the final three years of
the deal. The last draft pick to reach terms, Wadsworth could
actually play a few snaps today in pass-rush situations. Arizona
coach Vince Tobin still was considering that possibility. Wadsworth
will join end Simeon Rice and tackles Eric Swann and Mark Smith to
give the Cardinals one of the NFL's best young front fours.
</P>
<P>
   Purple hazing
</P>
<P>
   Former New Orleans linebacker Andre Royal, now playing for
Indianapolis, will not discuss his role in the ugly hazing incident
that occurred the final night of Saints training camp. Royal's only
statement was that, while he was involved, he is not the player who
wielded a bag of coins against rookie tight end Cam Cleeland. NFL
security officials continue their investigation. Word is that
Saints coach Mike Ditka, who traded Royal to Indy for tight end
Scott Slutzker, waived another culprit. At least one major
perpetrator remains on the New Orleans roster.
</P>
<P>
   Courting Haley?
</P>
<P>
   For at least 24 hours last week, the 49ers and Dallas Cowboys
toyed with the idea of bringing defensive end Charles Haley out of
retirement. Something still could happen with Dallas, but the
Niners have backed off the one-time pass-rush threat. Director of
football operations Dwight Clark broached to quarterback Steve
Young the possibility of Haley's return, and it apparently didn't
go over too well. In his book ``All the Rage,'' Haley noted that
Young was hardly the equal of Joe Montana. The Cowboys, who last
week did the annual restructuring of Troy Aikman's contract to
create salary-cap room, want to add a defensive front-seven player.
</P>
<P>
   The grapevine
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Penson, the New York real estate financier who is
offering $450 million for the Redskins, is said not to be a fan of
coach Norv Turner. ... Chicago coach Dave Wannstedt, who continues
to shuffle his linebackers, probably will take a look at deposed
Colts linebacker Quentin Coryatt, but not until next week. ... The
new, three-year deal the Giants gave quarterback Danny Kanell on
Thursday includes a signing bonus of $2.4 million.

WHITE SOX BEAT YANKEES, 9-5  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Baseball and Jim Abbott parted ways two years ago,
Abbott confused and hurt by his rapid demise. He had been an
18-game winner and threw a no-hitter for the Yankees in 1993, and
suddenly his ability abandoned him at age 28.
</P>
<P>
   But Abbott reconciled with baseball this summer, and Saturday,
in his first major league appearance in almost two years, he
pitched six and one-third innings and was the winning pitcher as
the Chicago White Sox stalled the Yankees, 9-5. Andy Pettitte
(15-9) lasted only two innings for the Yankees, surrendering five
runs and departing shortly after his manager went to the mound to
see if he might be hurt. The Yankees are 100-39, their magic number
for clinching the American League East down to four.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott, who turns 31 later this month, did not overwhelm the
Yankees, allowing eight hits, three walks and four runs and
benefitting from four double-plays. When he left the game in 1996,
his fastball was diminished, down to 83 to 84 miles an hour, and
that was about how hard he threw against the Yankees. On another
night, with another look at Abbott, the Yankees might have done a
lot more damage.
</P>
<P>
   But he was good enough to win, fortunate enough to win, aided by
inning-ending double-plays in the first, second, third and sixth
innings. The Yankees had a runner at first base and one out in the
sixth, for example, when Chili Davis smashed a grounder down the
third-base line, a would-be double _ until Robin Ventura, Chicago's
slick-fielding third baseman, intercepted the ball with a flash of
his glove, turned and fired to second to start the double-play.
Abbott, born without a right hand, pumped his left as he walked off
the field.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott walked Scott Brosius with one out in the seventh,
prompting Chicago Manager Jerry Manuel to call for a reliever. The
White Sox led by 8-3 at the time and Abbott was in position to get
his first victory since Sept. 8, 1996. Abbott stood on the mound
momentarily as the infielders congratulated him.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott had been released in the spring of 1997 and sat out the
season. But in May, he reached an agreement on a minor-league
contract with the White Sox and slowly worked his way back,
starting with Class A Hickory on May 31 and moving up through all
levels of the White Sox farm system.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was well aware of Abbott's history as he walked off
the mound Saturday night, and most stood and clapped for him.
Willie Randolph, the Yankees' third base coach, leaned forward and
said something to Abbott while the pitcher returned to the dugout,
and Abbott nodded in response.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte had allowed 26 hits and 15 runs in 22 innings in
winning just one of three starts before Saturday night's game,
competing voraciously, as he always does, in spite of mediocre
stuff. During his last start, against Seattle last Sunday, Mariners
Manager Lou Piniella pulled the left-hander Paul Spoljaric aside
and told him to watch Pettitte. This guy does not have anything,
Pettitte told Spoljaric, and see how he's battling.
</P>
<P>
   Facing the White Sox Saturday night, however, Pettitte did not
even have enough stuff to battle with, throwing just about
everything over the middle of the plate, and the White Sox battered
him before he was replaced after two innings. The Yankees announced
that Pettitte was fine and that his departure was not
injury-related, despite some evidence to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte had very poor control: Only half of the 42 pitches he
threw were for strikes, one possible symptom of injury. One pitch
into Craig Wilson's at-bat in the second inning, Torre and the
Yankees' pitching coach, Mel Stottlemyre, and catcher Joe Girardi
all hustled to the mound, asking the umpires for time so they could
ask Pettitte if he was hurt. Torre asked Pettitte if he was OK, and
Pettitte assured his manager he was. Then Torre and Stottlemyre
waited for Pettitte to throw two warm-up pitches before allowing
him to continue.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson smacked a double and Frank Thomas slapped a run-scoring
single and then was caught in a run-down that ended the inning.
Backing up home plate on the play, Pettitte rushed off the field
and disappeared into the runway, never to be seen again in this
game.
</P>
<P>
   Back trouble hampered Pettitte at the end of last season, when
he was pounded in two post-season starts. Earlier this season in
Montreal, in June, Torre suspected Pettitte was bothered by a
buttocks strain and removed him against his wishes. Pettitte
skipped a start in August after slightly injuring a muscle behind
his left shoulder. The Yankees maintain Pettitte is healthy, and
that may well be the case; virtually all major league teams at one
time or another mask or minimize injuries. Time will tell whether
Pettitte is healthy, if he can regain his effectiveness. He has
approximately four more starts to prepare for the American League
playoffs that begin Sept. 29.

CRASH INQUIRY FINDS A SILENCE FROM THE CREW  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to expand)   By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ The crew of the Swissair jet that crashed
near here on Wednesday night had stopped responding to air traffic
controllers about six minutes before the plane, an MD-11 with 229
people on board, hit the water, investigators said Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators also said that on Friday they detected the
homing device from one of the plane's ``black boxes,'' either the
cockpit voice recorder or the flight data recorder. Divers spent
this morning trying to find the recorder, they said, but had to be
called back because of bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   The chief investigator, Vic Gerden, said that shortly after the
plane's last radio transmission, in which a crew member told a
controller at the Moncton Area Control Center, ``We have to land
immediately,'' the plane's transponder also stopped working. That
piece of equipment transmits the plane's identity and altitude to
controllers, and when its signal stopped, radar data from the plane
became much less reliable, Gerden said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, with 215 passengers and a crew of 14, plunged into
the sea at 10:30 local time on Wednesday night, about 40 miles from
Halifax Airport, killing everyone aboard.
</P>
<P>
   The brief excerpts of the conversations between a controller in
Moncton and the crew _ released here Saturday night _ show flashes
of drama and tension. Someone on the plane, either the captain or
the first officer, tells the controller, ``We are declaring an
emergency at time zero one two four ... We are starting vent now.
We have to land immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerden, of Canada's Transportation Safety Board, said he was
consulting with Swissair pilots and MD-11 experts about what
``starting vent'' meant. It could have meant depressurizing the
airplane to allow the cockpit windows to be opened, or dumping
fuel, which the crew had said it would have to do, Gerden said.
</P>
<P>
   He would not characterize the tone of the exchanges in the 10
minutes that followed the crew's first announcement of a problem,
or say what had been going on in the cockpit in the final six
minutes after communication stopped. Gerden said it was impossible
to know now whether the pilots' silence meant that they had been
incapacitated by the smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the transponder stopped working, he said that the
failure might be ``indicating some electrical issue, potentially.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question about the tone of the crew members'
voices, Gerden said that it had changed in the course of the 10
minutes, probably indicating that they had put on oxygen masks. ``I
really don't have enough information to determine their condition
inside the cockpit, I'm afraid,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He cites smoke, but we really don't know what density of
smoke, what amount,'' Gerden said.
</P>
<P>
   In a briefing that lasted more than an hour, Gerden gave a
limited chronology of the last few minutes of the flight, beginning
at a point about 70 nautical miles from here.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, under the control of the Moncton Center, radioed in:
``Swissair 111 heavy is declaring pan-pan-pan. We have smoke in the
cockpit, request deviate immediate right turn to a convenient
place. I guess Boston.'' (``Heavy'' refers to a large aircraft.)
</P>
<P>
   Advised that the plane was 300 nautical miles from Boston, the
crew readily agreed to go to Halifax, but when told that the
airport was just 30 miles away, the pilot said: ``We need more than
30 miles.'' The controller told the plane to turn left to lose
altitude.
</P>
<P>
   Gerden said he would have experts analyze whether it was
possible to drop from the 33,000-foot cruising altitude to the
runway, which is not far above sea level, in the 30 miles
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem, he said, was weight. ``The aircraft at that
point, about that time, had a weight of about 230 metric tons,'' he
said. But it cannot land weighing more than 200 metric tons, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have taken probably in the vicinity of 12 minutes of
flying to dump that amount of fuel,'' he said. ``If one attempts to
land an aircraft at a weight that is greater than the maximum
landing weight, depending on many conditions _ length of runway,
surface condition of runway, is it wet, many other factors _ there
is a risk having landed the aircraft, it would go off the other end
of the runway at some unknown rate of speed and cause damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether, in hindsight, the crew might have done better
risking a landing, he said: ``The crew had a difficult situation to
contend with, starting with a high altitude and having to descend
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty miles, he said, was very short for the crew to ``descend
into an airport that you weren't expecting to descend into.'' The
crew would have had to decide quickly, he said, about risking a
landing above the maximum landing weight ``and at the same time,
contending with some problem, unknown at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are counting on the flight data recorder and the
cockpit voice recorder to answer many more questions and, they
hope, explain the source of the smoke. Even if an electrical
problem cut the power to those devices, Gerden said Saturday night,
knowing when they stopped working would be useful.
</P>
<P>
   The MD-11 is a computerized airplane and its flight data
recorder tracks about 100 ``parameters,'' he said. A parameter
could be the functioning of one of the plane's three engines, the
position of an aileron, the plane's speed, its heading, altitude,
acceleration or deceleration.
</P>
<P>
   Both ``black boxes'' are equipped with battery-powered
``pingers.'' These are activated by contact with water and are
supposed to work for 30 days. Since the boxes send out a signal at
the same frequency, 37.5 kilohertz, investigators do not know which
one they have heard.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian Coast Guard and Navy officials said they had about 40
vessels in the search area, from Zodiacs and Boston Whalers to a
submarine, the HMCS Okanagan. They have found one cylindrical
object, about 30 feet long, but have not sent divers down to
determine if it is part of the plane; they are concentrating
instead on finding the black boxes, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the chief medical examiner of Nova Scotia, Dr. John
Butt, reported that a French woman on the plane had been positively
identified by her family, the first such identification. He said he
did not expect many more identifications soon, although six teams
of pathologists are now working around the clock in a temporary
morgue at the military base at Shearwater, across Halifax harbor
from the provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
   Medical technicians have begun taking blood samples from
relatives gathered here, to aid in DNA analysis of the remains
being gathered off the water and the shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   Butt said that damage to bodies was consistent with an impact,
not damage from a blast.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate hangar at Shearwater, a different team is rinsing
down parts of the airplane, and explosives experts are examining
them ``as a precaution,'' said Chief Superintendent Steve Duncan of
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
</P>
<P>
   The search coordinators have established a Web site
(www.marlant.hlfx.dnd.ca/marlant/swissair), to describe their
progress.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Saturday, search boats placed wreaths on the water at
the request of families, and collected water samples for the
families to take home.

CUBS BEAT PIRATES, 8-4, AS SOSA GETS NO. 58  
 (HLW)

   PITTSBURGH _ It's called a home run race, but the contestants
are rooting for each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good luck to you, Sammy, tonight in Pittsburgh,'' Mark McGwire
said after hitting his 60th home run in an afternoon game in St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to clap for Mark,'' Sammy Sosa said, before
responding with his 58th homer Saturday night in Pittsburgh. ``I
want him to break the record.''
</P>
<P>
   Good cheer does not mean either player is conceding the race.
Sosa remained two behind McGwire in the competition to best Roger
Maris' record of 61 home runs. In te past 10 games, each player
has hit seven home runs.
</P>
<P>
   What a week it was, as at least one of the two homered for six
game days in a row. On Sunday came No. 55 for McGwire and 54 for
Sosa. On Monday, Sosa tied with his 55th. As September began on
Tuesday, McGwire pulled two ahead with 56 and 57. On Wednesday,
McGwire stretched the lead to three with 58 and 59, while Sosa his
his 56th. After Thursday's off day, Friday brought Sosa's 57th.
Then came Saturday's performances.
</P>
<P>
   Entering Three Rivers Stadium Saturday afternoon, Sosa walked
past the statue of Roberto Clemente, the first Latin player in the
Baseball Hall of Fame. Sosa, who was born in 1968 in the Dominican
Republic, keeps a figurine of Clemente in his locker. ``He is a
hero to me,'' Sosa said. Now Sosa holds the record for the most
home runs in a season by a Latin player and is the Cubs' nominee
for baseball's Roberto Clemente award, which honors charitable
work.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, Sosa first faced a rookie pitcher, Sean
Lawrence, who entered the game with only eight innings of big
league experience. As Sosa came to the plate for his first at-bat,
the scoreboard monitor showed a replay of McGwire hitting his 60th
home run. On the first pitch from Lawrence, Sosa hit a long foul
ball of home run distance to right field. As the next two pitches
missed the strike zone, the crowd of 37,711, eager for a home run,
booed. Sosa slapped a 3-2 pitch into center field for a single. He
moved to second on a single by Glenallen Hill. Both runners scored
on a double by Gary Gaetti, giving the Cubs an early lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the third inning, Sosa reached base again on a fielder's
choice.
</P>
<P>
   As Sosa led off the sixth inning, he was seeing Lawrence for the
third time, which was enough. He drove the ball an estimated 417
feet to the first row of the right-center-field crowd. Misplayed by
a fan, the ball dropped into the area between the outfield and the
stands.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, Sosa looked bad, swinging late on an outside
pitch by reliever Jeff Tabaka, a left-hander. Sosa leads the league
in strikeouts with 141, or one every four at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth, he hit a longer homer-length foul into the upper
deck off of Ricardo Rincon, driving the crowd into a frenzy. When
the home plate umpire, Angel Hernandez, called an outside pitch for
the third strike, fans booed, then streamed for the exit. Sosa
finished the night 2 for 5, raising his batting average to .314.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs' 8-4 victory was their sixth straight.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs have hit home runs in 17 consecutive games, a club
record.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, just two players, Sosa and McGwire, have hit 21
during that span.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa said he appreciated the warm reaction from the Pirates
fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They like me everywhere,'' Sosa said, beginning to grin. ``And
I would like to tell them that I love them, too.''

CARDS SIGN WADSWORTH TO SIX-YEAR DEAL 
</HEADLINE>

   IRVING, Texas _ Who needs practice?
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals first-round draft pick Andre Wadsworth apparently
doesn't need training camp or drills after ending his 44-day
holdout Saturday by signing a six-year deal that could be worth as
much as $42 million.
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth, who received a team-record signing bonus of $10.491
million, not only will dress for today's season opener against the
Dallas Cowboys but also is expected to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We presume he's in good physical condition, knowing the type
of person Andre is,'' said Coach Vince Tobin, who released rookie
defensive end Mike Moten to make room for Wadsworth on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think he'll get some snaps in the nickel as a pass rusher.
When you're the left end, you've got four guys rushing, all you
need to know is you rush up the field and try to sack the
quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth's agent, Roosevelt Barnes, said Wadsworth is ready to
play. ``He's like a caged animal,'' Barnes said. ``If they would
let him start, he'd start.''
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth said he is in ``the best physical shape he could
possibly be in but not football shape.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to train for constant repetitions of seven or eight
seconds of total explosion,'' said Wadsworth, who added that he's
not concerned of the health risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll make sure I stretch real well and make sure I watch what
I eat in the pregame meal because I know I'll have the butterflies.
Hopefully, I can dance around and (play) a little nickel, take some
little baby steps.''
</P>
<P>
   Until late Friday night, a deal between the Cardinals and
Wadsworth's agents, Eugene Parker and Barnes, didn't appear
imminent.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals maintained Wadsworth, the Florida state defensive
end who was the third pick overall, wanted to be paid as much as
San Diego Chargers rookie quarterback Ryan Leaf, the second pick
overall who received a five-year, $31 million deal.
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth didn't get as much as Leaf, but the Cardinals can opt
out of the deal after three years. If they decide to end the
contract after five years, Wadsworth's total deal would be worth
$30 million.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bidwill, team vice president who had been in France
until Friday, said both sides made concessions.
</P>
<P>
   A concession the Cardinals made was to allow the contract to
include escalators, pay-for-performance clauses.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the escalators were likely to be earned, Barnes said
they were if Wadsworth is  &UR; ...  &UR; (MISSINGTYPE)
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no gimmes, but he should be able to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   A concession Wadsworth's agents made a week ago was to abandon
their demand that the contract include voidable years. On Friday,
they dropped the amount of total package.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was time to play football,'' Michael Bidwill said. ``Andre
wanted to play football. We wanted him to play football.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said Wadsworth got involved in the negotiations and that
he started dealing directly with Michael Bidwill and his brother,
Bill Jr., who oversees contract negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two days, B.J. (Bidwill Jr.) and Michael got
personally involved,'' Barnes said. ``It was a lot smoother dealing
directly with them. They called me late (Friday) night and put a
proposal on the table. We put a proposal on the table. We were
within striking distance and then Michael and B.J. got aggressive
when they saw we could make a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The final contract wasn't much different than the deal the two
sides almost reached a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth said he wasn't upset that the negotiations took so
long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew eventually I was going to come (to terms),'' Wadsworth
said. ``I didn't know when.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to thank the Cardinals for showing confidence in me and
investing in me. I think this was perfect timing. Like a fine wine
or fine cheese, it takes time to come out and taste good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals didn't know that the impasse had ended until 12:45
p.m. Saturday when team owner Bill Bidwill grabbed the microphone
on the team's charter plane and told the team that Wadsworth had
agreed to terms.
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth, meanwhile, then boarded a plane in Tallahassee, Fla.,
for Dallas. He has been living there and taking a graduate class in
business administration during his holdout.
</P>
<P>
   The bonus the Cardinals paid Wadsworth _ part of it will be
deferred _ is the third largest given to an NFL rookie.
Indianapolis quarterback Peyton Manning, the first pick overall,
received an $11.6 million bonus. Leaf was paid a bonus of $11.25
million.
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth will earn the minium base salary of $144,000 for a
rookie this year. His annual salaries will then increase 25 percent
each year.
</P>
<P>
   His salary-cap figure for this season will be $1.89 million, the
remaining available under the team's rookie pool.
</P>
<P>
   With Wadsworth signing, the Cardinals now are about $2 million
under the $54.3 million salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a credit to the organization it stepped up to the plate
and got the contract signed,'' Tobin said. ``Hopefully, this is a
turning point in this organization.''
