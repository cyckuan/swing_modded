<HEADLINE> Pie Throwers Convicted of Battery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Three pie-throwers who pelted Mayor Willie  
Brown in the face were convicted of battery on Tuesday by jurors 
who apparently decided the offense wasn't so serious. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury deliberated for more than a day and asked the judge  
whether ``throwing a pie can be regarded as an act of comedy and 
not as an act of battery.'' Ultimately, they convicted the 
activists of battery, which carries a six month jail term. 
</P>
<P>
	They acquitted the pie-throwers of the more serious misdemeanor,  
assault on a public official, which is punishable by a year in 
jail. Sentencing was set for Feb. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a pastry uprising going on,'' an unrepentant Rahula  
Janowski told reporters after the verdict against her and two 
fellow members of the Biotic Baking Brigade. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy District Attorney Maria Bee said the verdict showed  
``there is a line between free speech and battery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown was hit with cherry, pumpkin and tofu pies while giving a  
speech in November. Janowski, 27, of San Francisco, Justin Gross, 
27, of Berkeley, and Jerard Livernois, 34, of San Francisco, said 
they were protesting the mayor's policies on homelessness.

	Clinton Addresses Congress, Public  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Speaking at this hour before a Congress and  
nation torn over impeachment, President Clinton is outlining his 
plans for Social Security, child care, education, crime-fighting, 
the environment and the Pentagon in his annual State of the Union 
address. ``With our budget surplus growing, our economy expanding, 
our confidence rising, now is the time for this generation to meet 
our historic responsibility to the 21st century,'' he says. He also 
calls for raising the minimum wage by $1 an hour over two years to 
$6.15. Despite the extreme partisan divisions in Washington right 
now, House Speaker Dennis Hastert has told lawmakers to be on good 
behavior. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton: Boost Social Security Fund  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's long-awaited proposal to  
shore up Social Security would use budget surpluses to ensure the 
retirement system can pay promised benefits. It also would create 
separate 401(k)-style accounts for most working Americans. And for 
the first time, the government could invest some of Social 
Security's cash reserves in the stock market. Those proposals, 
included in Clinton's State of the Union address, are part of the 
president's blueprint for using about $4.4 trillion in government 
surpluses now expected over the next 15 years. 

</P>
<P>
	Defense Team Presents Clinton's Side  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- White House Counsel Charles Ruff opened  
President Clinton's impeachment defense with a fervent plea to the 
senators who will decide the president's fate: ``He must not be 
removed from office.'' Ruff declared that ``William Jefferson 
Clinton is not guilty of the charges'' leveled by the House, 
including perjury and obstruction of justice in the cover-up of his 
affair with Monica Lewinsky. Ruff offered a point-by-point rebuttal 
of each allegation, criticized Kenneth Starr's handling of Linda 
Tripp and accused the House of ``prosecutorial ... fudge.''

	Survey Finds U.S. Cities Vibrant  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For a third straight year, local officials  
across America report that cities are strong, vibrant centers of 
industry and culture with improving opportunities for their 
residents. The 15th annual State of America's Cities survey paints 
a largely rosy picture of urban America with improvements in 
economic conditions, police-community relations and recreational 
opportunities. However, 34 percent of officials saw an increase in 
the need for emergency food and clothing distribution, shelter and 
health care.

	Defiant Milosevic Defends Crackdown  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A defiant Slobodan Milosevic  
defended Yugoslavia's crackdown in Kosovo, telling NATO's two top 
generals that he has a ``right to fight against terrorism.'' 
Milosevic's government has long maintained that ethnic Albanian 
rebels, who are fighting for independence from Serbia, are part of 
a terrorist organization. The State Department acknowledged that a 
meeting today between the NATO officials and the Yugoslav president 
appeared to have made little headway. The NATO leaders delivered a 
warning that Milosevic risks airstrikes if he does not honor the 
terms of a three-month-old cease-fire.

	New Weight-Loss Drug Called Safe  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- An advisory panel to the FDA has judged an  
experimental diet drug to be safe and effective enough for the U.S. 
market. Orlistat, trade-named Xenical, helped obese people shed 
pounds and keep them off in a two-year study, according to 
researchers. The drug, manufactured by Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., 
blocks absorption of about one-third of fat that people consume, 
researchers said.

	Microsoft Beats Earnings Estimates  
</P>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. far outperformed analysts'  
estimates for its second quarter, racking up a 72 percent increase 
in profits as strong growth in personal computer shipments boosted 
demand for its software. Microsoft had net income of $1.98 billion 
and diluted earnings per share of 73 cents for the quarter ended 
Dec. 31. Revenues for the quarter were $4.94 billion.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dennis Rodman has decided to retire from  
professional basketball and will likely go into the sports and 
entertainment field, his agent said. Dwight Manley said the 
controversial Chicago Bulls forward and seven-time NBA rebounding 
leader gave him the news this afternoon. Rodman won three 
championships with the Chicago Bulls in 1996, 1997 and 1998, and 
two titles with the Detroit Pistons in 1989 and 1990.

<HEADLINE> Americans Watch Clinton Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Many Americans watching President Clinton's speech to Congress  
on Tuesday said it told them more about the state of the presidency 
than the state of the union. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael O. Norton of Boston didn't much like what he saw, but  
Joe Tarin in El Paso, Texas, was proud of Clinton for sticking to 
his agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's sitting here as if everything's going OK. I think it's  
just a facade,'' said Norton, a 40-year-old salesman who watched 
President Clinton's State of the Union speech Tuesday night from 
the Boston Athletic Club. ``He's talking about all the safe issues. 
This is like a last-ditch effort to save himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others saw a different Clinton -- one unswayed by his impeachment  
trial, one who has stayed true to his agenda despite the political 
turmoil around him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's more confident -- it's like he's not even thinking about  
the other issues. He's really saying, `The sky's the limit,''' said 
Tarin, one of about 20 people who fell silent at L &AMP; J Cafe, a bar 
and Democratic hangout east of downtown El Paso. ``I think he's 
putting the stamp on his administration. He's saying, `I'm not 
going to let history judge me by the impeachment trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's words were received with smiles, cheers and heads  
nodding in agreement at the Mambi Restaurant, a neighborhood bar 
and chicken takeout spot in northern Manhattan frequented primarily 
by Dominican immigrants. People stopping in for a drink or dinner 
were glued to the television, which broadcast the speech dubbed in 
Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
	As Clinton talked about a proposed retirement savings plan,  
Pedro Dominguez, a 31-year-old pharmacist from nearby Bergen, N.J., 
said the president had not allowed the trial to cripple his work. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looks like a little confused, but he's doing a good job for  
the people -- a great job,'' he said. ``He's doing something for the 
people. He tried to make a better life for the people of the United 
States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jean Joseph, who watched Clinton from a barber shop called  
Chicago's in the largely black, working-class San Francisco 
neighborhood of Western Addition, agreed that the president looked 
confident. However, he said, the confidence was probably coming 
from Clinton's belief that the public is fed up with his enemies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, it's not confidence for the right reason,''  
said Joseph, a 25-year-old finance analyst. ``He's not drawing 
confidence from the quality of his job so much as for the disdain 
for politics and the political games that are being played.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary student Don Brown,  
hearing Clinton talk about the need for ``discipline'' in creating 
academic standards was just too much. 
</P>
<P>
	``Discipline?'' Brown, 25, scoffed at the television set.  
``That's something he ought to apply to himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow students who watched the speech with Brown at an  
apartment in Wake Forest, N.C. agreed, laughing at the mixed 
responses of attendees in the House chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Supreme Court is not even clapping,'' said Chris Thompson,  
30, of Durham. ``He's subverting the whole judicial system -- that's 
why.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others rebuffed the suggestion made by some legislators that  
Clinton should have postponed the speech because it came at such an 
awkward time during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not Bill Clinton. The Bill Clinton I know is going  
forward,'' said Robert Harlin, owner of Chicago's barber shop. 
``He's said all this stuff before but the more times he says it, it 
gives people hope that there's a future, that there's a tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second year in a row that Clinton delivered his State  
of the Union speech against a backdrop of personal scandal. Last 
year's speech came just a week after initial reports of his sexual 
relationship with Monica Lewinsky.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seizes Stage From GOP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton wasn't the only one trying  
to prove he could separate the Senate impeachment trial from his 
conduct of the nation's business. Congress wants to demonstrate it 
can operate on two tracks as well. 
</P>
<P>
	But majority-party Republicans wound up watching largely in  
silence Tuesday night as Clinton grabbed the spotlight -- addressing 
a national TV audience on the State of the Union even as he remains 
the defendant in a Senate impeachment trial by day. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite dueling congressional news conferences over agendas,  
Clinton also offered the day's most dramatic new initiative: a plan 
to shore up Social Security by using budget surpluses and allowing 
some of the money to be invested in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	Not surprisingly, Clinton did not utter a word about his  
impeachment as he turned in a buoyant 77-minute performance, 
offering a large grab bag of legislative proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Clinton is the one on trial for his job, largely  
subdued Republicans clearly appeared the most uncomfortable, 
turning into -- at least for the duration of the speech -- a largely 
silent majority. Democrats, for the most part, applauded 
vigorously. 
</P>
<P>
	A few Republicans, including House Judiciary Committee Chairman  
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., declined to attend. But most of them sat 
stiffly through the speech. As he walked down the aisle, few 
Republicans reached for his extended hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Others offered grudging respect even as they criticized the  
specific proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I found fault with a lot of it, but it was a nice speech,''  
said Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio. Said the new House speaker, Dennis 
Hastert, R-Ill.: ``The president has made a good speech, but now we 
must put aside the rhetoric and get down to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mindful of opinion polls showing that most Americans want  
Clinton to remain in office, Republicans went to great lengths to 
stress their ability to get on to issues of substance and not be 
preoccupied with the impeachment process. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter what the outcome of the president's situation, life  
in America will go on,'' said Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash, who 
delivered half of the GOP televised response. ``Our lives will 
continue to be filled with practical matters, not constitutional 
ones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a good performance,'' said Wayne Fields, a professor at  
Washington University in St. Louis who has written a book on 
presidential addresses. ``He was able to demonstrate a kind of 
composure and control that suggests he's still the president. 
Americans needed to be reassured that the office is functioning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And in making many Republicans in the audience squirm, Clinton  
also managed to convey ``that if there's a breakdown in government, 
it's happening on their side, not his side,'' Fields said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the sight of Clinton delivering the address in the House  
chamber -- before both his accusers and his judges -- was an 
extraordinary one to many observers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just weird, it's just strange,'' said James Thurber, a  
political scientist at American University, comparing the event to 
an opera. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tenor's standing up and singing before those who indicted  
him and those who are judging him.'' Still, Thurber said, the 
president's song ``shows he can deal with most issues of governing 
at the same time this (trial) is going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question that the unpopularity of the impeachment  
has worried Republicans a great deal and prompted them to try to 
jump start a legislative agenda,'' said Tom Mann, director of 
governmental studies at the Brookings Institution. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president gained by just showing up. He reminded the  
public why they like him in office, reminding them of peace and 
prosperity and, just for a moment, turning the attention away from 
what the public has tired of long ago,'' Mann said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although some lawmakers had suggested Clinton postpone the  
speech -- or deliver it in writing -- few expected him to voluntarily 
pass up the chance to address a national audience on his own terms. 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't mean Republicans were comfortable by what Sen. Phil  
Gramm, R-Texas, likened to a visit to the dentist. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't withdraw the invitation because we didn't want it to  
look like we were not going to carry on business,'' said Sen. Kay 
Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	And one stark realty remains for the president. Today, as he  
gets back to business promoting his agenda, the Senate also resumes 
the business of trying Clinton.

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- President-elect Hugo Chavez warned  
Tuesday that Congress could be dissolved if it tries to stop 
Venezuela from adopting a new constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	At a press conference, Chavez charged that Venezuela's  
traditional political parties are already trying to derail his plan 
for a national referendum on whether to convene a constituent 
assembly to rewrite the constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	If Congress tries to interfere with the work of the proposed  
assembly, ``then the assembly could dissolve it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez, a former paratrooper who led a failed 1992 coup attempt,  
won a landslide victory in the December by riding a wave of 
discontent over corruption and poverty. His opponents fear he will 
rule with an iron fist and question his commitment to democracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez, who takes office Feb.2, made the constituent assembly  
the centerpiece of his campaign, saying that Venezuela's 1961 
constitution is no longer capable of addressing society's needs.

Abdullah on Saturday in Carmen de Bolivar, a town 360 miles north 
of Bogota, said Antonio Leiva, who works at the government 
anti-kidnapping office. 
</P>
<P>
	Danish media said the rebels had demanded $75,000 for Abdullah's  
release. Leiva said he did not know if the ransom was paid.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Agricultural scientists from four nations  
will help Nicaraguan and Honduran farmers rebuild their seed 
supplies and restore food production abilities which were 
devastated by Hurricane Mitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Future Harvest, an agricultural education group based in  
Washington, said Monday that the two-year program will help 
re-establish crops wiped out by the storm and teach farmers 
techniques to decrease their vulnerability in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Agricultural research centers in Mexico, Colombia, Peru and  
Italy are leading the effort, Future Harvest said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Mitch hit Central America in late October, destroying  
up to 70 percent of Honduras' and Nicaragua's basic food crops, 
primarily beans and maize. About 80 percent of the commercial crops 
destined for export were lost.

	QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Ecuador is in a critical situation due to  
a massive budget deficit inherited by his government, President 
Jamil Mahuad said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a serious crisis, the worst in 70 years,'' Mahuad, who  
took office five months ago, said in the annual State of the Union 
address to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecuador's budget deficit topped $1.5 billion in 1998, he said.  
The tiny South American nation's total budget was $5.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The deficit caused Ecuador's 1998 inflation rate to reach 43.4  
percent, the highest in Latin America, Mahuad said. 
</P>
<P>
	Battered by El Nino-powered floods and low world prices for oil,  
its principal export, Ecuador's economy grew by only 0.8 percent in 
1998, he said. In 1999, the economy is expected to grow by 1.7 
percent with inflation of 22 to 27 percent.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The leftist Zapatista rebels have found  
sponsors in 25 of the country's 31 states to provide assistance to 
rebel representatives organizing a referendum on Indian rights, 
rebel supporters said Tuesday, 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels hope to eventually be present in all of Mexico's  
2,500 townships and then hold conferences and the referendum on 
March 21. 
</P>
<P>
	The sponsors, which include political, union and civic groups,  
will help promote the planned meetings, said Rosario Ibarra, one of 
the event organizers. The results of the referendum on a proposed 
law guaranteeing Indian rights will be released soon after the 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The Zapatistas staged a brief armed uprising in the southern  
state of Chiapas in 1994. Peace talks between the rebels and the 
government have been stalled since 1996 due to disagreements over 
the Indian rights law.

<HEADLINE>  Atlanta Revels in Falcons 1st Bowl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- No one expected the Atlanta Falcons to be in the  
Super Bowl. Even the NFL was caught off guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Dan Reeves was grinning with satisfaction Monday as he  
discussed his dealings with the league after the Falcons shocked 
the heavily favored Minnesota Vikings in the NFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, following Atlanta's 30-27 overtime victory, Reeves  
met with two NFL officials about the schedule of events at the Jan. 
31 Super Bowl in Miami. He couldn't help but notice the itinerary 
was sprinkled with references to the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, on Monday, the NFL faxed Reeves a memo that included  
another faux pas. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could tell they weren't expecting us because it said,  
`Atlanta Falcons, head coach Denny Green,''' Reeves said, grinning 
with satisfaction. ``They had changed the team from Minnesota 
Vikings, but they forgot to change the head coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Well, get used to the idea of Atlanta playing in the Super Bowl,  
as strange as that may seem for a franchise that's had only eight 
winning seasons in 33 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Denver is an early seven-point favorite in  
the Super Bowl, which doesn't bother the Falcons a bit. They have 
reveled in the role of underdog all season, beating a Minnesota 
team that was a double-figure favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole country had them beating us by 11 points, had them  
on top of the world,'' tight end O.J. Santiago said. ``Every time I 
looked at the TV, it seemed like Minnesota was on there. There's 
nothing wrong with that. They broke a lot of records. 
</P>
<P>
	``But at 14-2 (Atlanta's record during the regular season), you  
think somebody would notice we've got a good team. Now, maybe they 
will notice us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oh, they're noticing -- especially in Atlanta, where the city  
awoke Monday with a giant ``Dirty Bird'' hangover. 
</P>
<P>
	The party spilled into the streets as soon as Andersen's kick  
sailed through the uprights, then moved to Hartsfield Atlanta 
International Airport, where the team was greeted by more than 
5,000 people late Sunday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	``You felt like you were in a dream world,'' said linebacker  
Jessie Tuggle, who has been with the Falcons for a dozen, mostly 
losing seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 4,000 or so revelers jammed the team's suburban training  
complex, creating a rush hour-like traffic jam in the middle of the 
night. The scene was surreal when the players, after taking buses 
from the airport, appeared on a second-floor balcony, saluting the 
crowd that had taken over the practice field below. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was absolutely nuts,'' Tuggle said. ``It was like a rock  
concert in Suwanee, Ga.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Dan Reeves, who underwent heart bypass surgery just five  
weeks ago, endured a whirlwind schedule Monday. After getting only 
4 1/2 hours of sleep, he appeared on ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' 
stopped by Piedmont Hospital for a routine checkup, and held his 
usual postgame news conference in Suwanee. The team will begin 
practicing for the Broncos on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the Super Bowl focus will be on Reeves, who will be  
facing the team he coached for 12 years and took to three title 
games. He'll also be facing the coach he fired for alleged 
subordination and the quarterback who said playing for Reeves was 
``hell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves, fired by the Broncos after the 1992 season, insisted  
Monday that he has buried any hard feelings for Mike Shanahan and 
John Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't live in the past,'' the Falcons coach said. ``If  
you're going to be a football coach and you preach and teach to the 
players that they should look to the next play and not think about 
the last one, I think you have to go through life the same way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves said there was a reconciliation of sorts last summer,  
when by chance all three wound up playing golf on the same day at 
Augusta National. The Atlanta coach congratulated Shanahan and 
Elway on their Super Bowl victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's done in the past is done,'' Reeves said. ``I can look  
myself in the mirror and say I did what was best for my football 
team at the time. You have to make some tough decisions. I can't 
change them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, there are new debts to pay.  
</P>
<P>
	Reeves, who turns 55 today, promised to perform the ``Dirty  
Bird'' dance in downtown Atlanta if the Falcons made the Super 
Bowl. He claims he did just that in the pre-dawn hours Monday, 
stopping his car along Peachtree Street and flapping his arms. 
</P>
<P>
	There's only one problem: he had no witnesses.  
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't say how long and I didn't say when, so I did it this  
morning,'' Reeves said with a smile. ``It was 6:45, and there was 
nobody on the road. That's why I did it, and I did it goooood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Falcons receiver Terance Mathis, who caught the touchdown pass  
that sent the game to overtime, wasn't buying Reeves' version of 
events. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a copout, man,'' Mathis said with a laugh. ``He could  
have at least called the media and alerted them. That doesn't 
count. We're going to make him do it.''

<HEADLINE> Study: Inner-City Shoppers Have Cash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Despite having only a limited number of stores  
in their neighborhoods, inner-city residents still buy clothes, 
electronics and furniture more often than the average American 
household, a new study shows. 
</P>
<P>
	While it's been known that urban America is a largely untapped  
retail market, the study, which was released today, illustrates the 
significant purchasing power found in inner cities and what these 
residents want to buy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone is chasing after retailing in places like Beverly  
Hills, but very few are chasing places like the south side of 
Chicago,'' said Anne Habiby, director of research for the 
Boston-based Initiative for a Competitive Inner City, which did the 
study with the accounting and consulting firm 
PricewaterhouseCoopers. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they don't realize is that the inner cities have a much  
higher disposable retail dollar than almost any suburban square 
mile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study of 1,205 inner-city households was done by mail in  
October and November 1997, and the results were compared with an 
existing PricewaterhouseCoopers database of shoppers nationwide. 
The new report is a more detailed version of two other reports 
issued last June. The Initiative said this is the first time that 
such a vast amount of material has been collected on a national 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
	The study shows that inner-city shoppers spend nearly 11 percent  
more on clothing annually than the average U.S. household. 
African-Americans buy the most, almost 30 percent more than the 
average American consumer. 
</P>
<P>
	Many also spend generously on their homes. Forty-three percent  
of inner-city shoppers said they purchase furniture, compared with 
30 percent of all U.S. shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-one percent of African Americans and 37 percent of  
Hispanics bought a television, VCR or stereo in the past year, 
compared with 25 percent of average U.S. households. 
</P>
<P>
	When they shop, urban consumers have greater brand loyalty than  
the average population. They are also more apt to look for stores 
that accept credit cards and offer superior customer service. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also highlights inner-city shoppers' demand for better  
prices, especially for groceries and clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	While there is clearly room for growth in the inner cities, the  
market is still severely underserved. Most retail sales are 
relegated to small, specialty stops, which are expensive and carry 
only a limited inventory. 
</P>
<P>
	The intention of the study is to show well-known national retail  
chains that there is a huge potential of the urban market. Only 
handful of stores, like the drug store chain Rite-Aid and Sears, 
currently operate stores in inner cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest push is for an increased number of discount chains,  
like Target and Wal-Mart, in urban areas. Inner-city shoppers spend 
significantly less than the average consumer at these stores, even 
though they are the biggest area of growth in U.S. retailing today.

<HEADLINE> Priest Who Died at Altar Is Mourned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- Like her fellow parishioners at St. Mary's  
Catholic Church, Peggy Puglisi has known how to say the rosary 
since she was a child. But when her priest collapsed and died while 
celebrating Mass, the words just wouldn't come. 
</P>
<P>
	Monsignor Adam J. Kostick was stricken by an apparent heart  
attack moments after consecrating the bread and wine during 
Sunday's Mass. His hands were still raised in prayer when he closed 
his eyes and collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were crying,'' said Puglisi, one of about 700  
parishioners in church at the time. ``Some of us started saying the 
rosary. We've known that all our lives, but everybody was mumbling 
and stumbling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kostick, who turned 73 last week, had been pastor of the church  
in this Washington suburb for the past 16 years. Hundreds of his 
parishioners gathered at the church Monday for a regular weekday 
Mass that was overshadowed by their priest's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people took comfort in how Kostick died.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's the way he wanted to die -- at the altar,'' said  
Monsignor James Beattie, pastor of St. Bartholomew's Church in 
nearby Bethesda, who played golf with Kostick every Tuesday for the 
past 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Kostick gleefully announced that the congregation had  
raised $1.3 million, nearly double its goal, for school 
scholarships and improvements to the church and its grounds, which 
includes a 19th century cemetery where writer F. Scott Fitzgerald 
is buried. 
</P>
<P>
	``He made sure he got this whole place in shape first, and then  
he died,'' parishioner Nancy Keefe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Until a new pastor is found, the church's associate pastor, Rev.  
L. James Downs, is leading the congregation, which is made up of 
about 2,000 families. 
</P>
<P>
	The church plans to offer grief counseling to parishioners,  
particularly children, Downs said, noting that members of the 
church's youth choir were just 15 feet from Kostick when he 
collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's so difficult,'' he said. ``We hope to defuse some of  
their fright.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A funeral Mass is scheduled for Thursday at St. Mary's.

<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- The Oakland Athletics re-signed relief  
pitcher T.J. Mathews to a $750,000, one-year contract Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mathews, who was 7-4 with a save and a 4.58 ERA with Oakland  
last season, earned $315,000 last year. He was the last player on 
the A's roster who was eligible for arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	Mathews made his major league debut with St. Louis four years

<HEADLINE>  Atlanta Revels in Falcons 1st Bowl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- No one expected the Atlanta Falcons to be in the  
Super Bowl. Even the NFL was caught off guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Dan Reeves was grinning with satisfaction Monday as he  
discussed his dealings with the league after the Falcons shocked 
the heavily favored Minnesota Vikings in the NFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, following Atlanta's 30-27 overtime victory, Reeves  
met with two NFL officials about the schedule of events at the Jan. 
31 Super Bowl in Miami. He couldn't help but notice the itinerary 
was sprinkled with references to the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, on Monday, the NFL faxed Reeves a memo that included  
another faux pas. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could tell they weren't expecting us because it said,  
`Atlanta Falcons, head coach Denny Green,''' Reeves said, grinning 
with satisfaction. ``They had changed the team from Minnesota 
Vikings, but they forgot to change the head coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Well, get used to the idea of Atlanta playing in the Super Bowl,  
as strange as that may seem for a franchise that's had only eight 
winning seasons in 33 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Denver is an early seven-point favorite in  
the Super Bowl, which doesn't bother the Falcons a bit. They have 
reveled in the role of underdog all season, beating a Minnesota 
team that was a double-figure favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole country had them beating us by 11 points, had them  
on top of the world,'' tight end O.J. Santiago said. ``Every time I 
looked at the TV, it seemed like Minnesota was on there. There's 
nothing wrong with that. They broke a lot of records. 
</P>
<P>
	``But at 14-2 (Atlanta's record during the regular season), you  
think somebody would notice we've got a good team. Now, maybe they 
will notice us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oh, they're noticing -- especially in Atlanta, where the city  
awoke Monday with a giant ``Dirty Bird'' hangover. 
</P>
<P>
	The party spilled into the streets as soon as Andersen's kick  
sailed through the uprights, then moved to Hartsfield Atlanta 
International Airport, where the team was greeted by more than 
5,000 people late Sunday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	``You felt like you were in a dream world,'' said linebacker  
Jessie Tuggle, who has been with the Falcons for a dozen, mostly 
losing seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 4,000 or so revelers jammed the team's suburban training  
complex, creating a rush hour-like traffic jam in the middle of the 
night. The scene was surreal when the players, after taking buses 
from the airport, appeared on a second-floor balcony, saluting the 
crowd that had taken over the practice field below. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was absolutely nuts,'' Tuggle said. ``It was like a rock  
concert in Suwanee, Ga.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Dan Reeves, who underwent heart bypass surgery just five  
weeks ago, endured a whirlwind schedule Monday. After getting only 
4 1/2 hours of sleep, he appeared on ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' 
stopped by Piedmont Hospital for a routine checkup, and held his

<HEADLINE> UConn Still No. 1 in AP Hoops Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Miami coach Leonard Hamilton understands the historical  
significance of finding the Hurricanes among college basketball's 
top 25 teams. He just hopes his team deserves the same respect come 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you have to earn the right to be in the Top 25,''  
Hamilton said Monday after Miami broke a 39-year absence from The 
Associated Press rankings by capturing the 25th spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not important on January 18th,'' the coach said. ``Now,  
would it be important for the school and the kids to get national 
recognition? Yes, it would. If at the end of the season we're where 
we want to be, I'll be happy. Not on January 18th.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last time Miami was ranked by the AP was the end of the  
1959-60 season, when the Hurricanes were 10th. The span in-between 
included a 15-year gap when the university discontinued the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no change at the top, with Connecticut ranked No. 1  
for the eighth consecutive week and Duke a solid No. 2 for the 
sixth week in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut (15-0), an easy winner over Notre Dame and  
Pittsburgh last week, received 53 first-place votes and 1,755 
points from the national media panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke (17-1), which beat Wake Forest and Florida State last week,  
topped 18 ballots and had 1,721 points. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 3 Stanford and No. 4 Maryland each moved up one spot, taking  
advantage of Cincinnati's first setback in a loss to North 
Carolina-Charlotte. The Bearcats dropped two places to fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn, joining Connecticut as the only unbeaten teams in  
Division I, rose two notches to sixth. The Tigers were followed in 
the Top Ten by Kentucky, St. John's, Arizona and North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State was 11th, followed by New Mexico and UCLA. Next  
came five straight Big Ten teams -- Iowa, Wisconsin, Purdue, 
Minnesota and Indiana. Kansas was 19th and Syracuse 20th. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Christian, Arkansas, Oklahoma State, Louisville and Miami  
rounded out the Top 25. Louisville (10-3) is the week's other 
newcomer, ranked for the first time this season after winning four 
straight. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami (11-3) entered the rankings after winning nine of its past  
10 games, losing only to Notre Dame. Its other losses have been to 
Kentucky and North Carolina-Charlotte; wins have included Ohio 
State and St. John's. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Hamilton, Miami's players accepted the news in a rather  
low-key fashion. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a definite accomplishment,'' said Tim James, the  
Hurricanes' leading scorer with an 18.8 average. ``We've just got 
to keep it strong from here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami's basketball tradition is a brief one. The 1959-60 team  
earned the school's first NCAA tournament berth after a 23-3 
season, losing to Western Kentucky in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Barry, who went on to a Hall of Fame NBA career, played at  
Miami from 1963-65 before jumping to the pros. In 1970, the school 
dropped the sport because of a lack of interest in South Florida, 
not to return until 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a team that's trying to build a tradition,'' said  
Hamilton, 109-132 in his ninth season at Miami. ``Once we get 
there, I hope we'll stay there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State and Clemson fell out of the rankings this week.  
Losses to Iowa and Michigan dropped Ohio State from 21st. Clemson, 
25th last week, lost to Florida State and Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State's exit ends the Big Ten's record-tying run of seven  
teams at one week. The conference also had seven teams ranked in 
January 1993, also lasting one week.

<HEADLINE> Text of House Managers' Response </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Text of House managers' response to White House Counsel Charles  
Ruff's presentation to the Senate in defense of President Clinton: 
</P>
<P>
	WHITE HOUSE CLAIM:   	
</P>
<P>
	White House Counsel Charles Ruff today claimed that the managers  
have only alleged that President Clinton lied to the grand jury 
about the nature and timing of his relationship with Monica 
Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	THE TRUTH:   	
</P>
<P>
	Here are four examples of perjurious statements made to the  
grand jury: 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``I was trying to figure out what the facts were.'' --  
President Clinton, grand jury testimony, Aug. 17, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the president's perjurious response as to why he was  
coaching Betty Currie, a potential witness, when he said to her in 
his deposition: 
</P>
<P>
	--''I was never alone with Monica, right?''  
</P>
<P>
	--''You were always there when Monica was there, right?''  
</P>
<P>
	--''Monica came on to me, and I never touched her, right?''  
</P>
<P>
	--''She wanted to have sex with me, and I cannot do that.''  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``I wasn't paying a great deal of attention.'' -- President  
Clinton, grand jury testimony, Aug. 17, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the president's perjurious response as to why he let  
his attorney use a false affidavit that the president encouraged 
Monica Lewinsky to file in order to prevent questioning before a 
federal judge. Note: the videotape shows the president looking 
directly at his attorney when he discussed the affidavit with the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	3. ``My goal in this deposition was to be truthful.'' --  
President Clinton, grand jury testimony, Aug. 17, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the president's perjurious response as to what his oath  
meant to him in the judicial proceeding in which he perjured 
himself in order to prevent a citizen from pursuing a civil rights 
claim. 
</P>
<P>
	4. ``I said to them things that were true about the  
relationship.'' -- President Clinton, grand jury testimony, Aug. 17, 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the president's perjurious response to questions about  
statements he made to White House aides whom he knew would be 
called before the grand jury to give testimony.

<HEADLINE> Pirjo Haeggman Stamped by Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- She broke the tape at races with  
stunning frequency and helped break the gender barrier at the top 
of the Olympics. Now Pirjo Haeggman has recorded another first, one 
that spoils a shining career. 
</P>
<P>
	Haeggman on Tuesday became the first IOC member to resign amid  
the bribery scandal roiling the Olympic community. She said she 
never violated her oath and denied any wrongdoing but said she 
could no longer function as a leader of sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Olympic Games are in the future the most important  
happening in sports, and one which unites the whole world,'' said 
the former sprinter, known better as a loyal member of the rank and 
file than as an Olympic power broker. 
</P>
<P>
	Until her name surfaced last week in allegations connected with  
Salt Lake City winning the 2002 Winter Games, the 47-year-old 
Haeggman embodied some of the qualities dearest to the self-image 
of Finns and the Olympics themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Even in a country with a history of fine runners, Haeggman was a  
standout. She won national championships in the 100- and 400-meters 
12 times and competed in three Olympics -- Munich in 1972, Montreal 
in 1976 and Moscow in 1980. Her top Olympic performance was fourth 
place in the 400 meters in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	A year after her last Olympic race, Haeggman was one of the  
first two women appointed to the IOC, a point of national pride. 
She also pursued teaching and commercial careers, starting out as a 
physical education teacher, switching to sales and marketing in the 
1980s, then returning to teaching in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, the Finnish post office issued a stamp picturing  
Haeggman and fellow runner Riitta Salin. 
</P>
<P>
	Haeggman was born Airi Pirjo Maritta in 1951 in Sotkamo, a small  
town on the shore of a vast lake in the heavily forested uplands of 
eastern Finland. She won her first national title in 1964 and kept 
racking them up until 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	Between competing and training, she was studying -- earning a  
master's degree in physical education when she was just 22. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1974, she married Bjarne Haeggman and they have two sons.  
They divorced in 1995, but before then came the events that linked 
her to the bribery investigation which has shaken the Olympic 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
	Bjarne Haeggman reportedly worked briefly for the Salt Lake bid  
committee and for 20 months in a Canadian government job initiated 
by the committee pushing Toronto's bid for the 1996 Olympics. 
Toronto also paid $650-a-month rent on the family's house in Sault 
Ste. Marie, Ontario, according to bid committee chief Paul 
Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
	``My impression up to this day has been that the rent for our  
dwelling was paid according to the contract by my husband's

the committee paid the rent.''

	Haeggman also said she quit the IOC to free the Helsinki 2006  
Winter Olympics bid from any harm her tarnished reputation might 
cause. She resigned from her marketing position with the bid 
committee.

own career,'' Haeggman said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wants Lower Trade Barriers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- To combat a rise of protectionism in the wake  
of the global financial crisis, the Clinton administration plans to 
push an ambitious agenda to lower trade barriers, including new 
trade talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials said Tuesday that the new round of  
talks, which could be called the Clinton Round, will be the key 
U.S. goal at a meeting of trade ministers from more than 120 
countries in December. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must tear down barriers, open markets and expand trade,''  
Clinton said in his State of the Union speech Tuesday night. At the 
same time, he warned Japan that if its steel exports ``are not 
reversed, America will respond.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said Clinton believes it is important to push ahead with  
trade liberalization in an effort to counter growing protectionist 
sentiment as nations struggle to cope with the 18-month global 
currency crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``This period of financial stress puts a lot of pressure on our  
trading partners to backtrack on reform and openness and the 
president sees a new round as keeping the momentum going for 
openness,'' said an administration official, who spoke on condition 
of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will need new trade negotiating authority from Congress.  
This authority, known as ``fast track'' because it requires 
Congress to consider any agreements on an expedited basis without 
the chance for amendments, has been a contentious issue for the 
past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has been blocked in efforts to win fast track  
authority because of determined opposition from environmental and 
labor groups who are insisting that any new trade agreements must 
include greater protections for worker rights and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Philip Crane, chairman of the subcommittee that handles  
trade matters in the House, called on Clinton to back up his call 
for new global trade talks with an aggressive effort to get fast 
track approved by Congress in the next six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be extraordinarily difficult for the president to be  
credible in these negotiations without having fast track 
authority,'' said Crane, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Hufbauer, an economist at the Institute of International  
Economics, said that the decision to push ahead with a new trade 
round was not likely to overcome opposition to fast track among 
Democrats, especially in the House. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clinton will really have to work to persuade those in his own  
party in the face of determined opposition among labor unions,'' 
Hufbauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Greg Mastel, a trade expert at the Economic Strategy  
Institute, said a new trade round, with its promise of major trade 
liberalization in a number of areas, ``improves the chances for 
fast track but it is still an uphill battle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	European and Japanese officials had been urging the United  
States to back a new, comprehensive round of negotiations but the 
administration had been debating internally just how broad those 
talks should be, fearing a repeat of the impasse that plagued the 
last global trade talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Those discussions, known as the Uruguay Round, because they were  
launched in 1986 in Punta del Este, Uruguay, dragged on for seven 
years because countries could not reach agreement on all facets of 
the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	While planning to push for comprehensive talks, the  
administration wants a more limited range of negotiations than the 
Uruguay Round. Among the areas it will seek to cover are industrial 
tariffs, agriculture, services, intellectual property, labor rights 
and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Europeans and Japan have said they would like a three-year  
deadline on the talks, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The actual scope of the talks will be decided in discussions  
over the next several months leading up to the December ministerial 
meeting. While the site has not been selected, the six cities being 
considered are Dallas, Denver, Detroit, San Diego, Seattle and 
Honolulu.

<HEADLINE> Russia Denies Defaulting on Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Despite missing large payments to foreign  
creditors, Russia still denies that it has defaulted on its 
international debts, the finance minister said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Russia won't agree to the default. We're sure that we can  
reach an understanding'' with creditors, Finance Minister Mikhail 
Zadornov said in parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Western investors declared Russia in default on its debts to the  
London Club of commercial creditors last month. Since then, 
government officials have repeatedly engaged in semantic arguments 
to say that the country is not in default. 
</P>
<P>
	The London Club was expected to announce today whether it will  
demand a faster repayment of about $23 billion in loans. Russia has 
also missed payments recently on its debt to the Paris Club, a 
group of government creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's total foreign debt is about $150 billion, and $17.5  
billion comes due this year. The government said it hopes to repay 
about $9.5 billion this year and restructure the remaining $8 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the government is trying to win approval for an  
austere budget designed to help lift Russia out of its worst 
economic crisis since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Parliament's lower house gave initial approval to the budget  
last month, but Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said he wanted to 
see more spending on social welfare programs.

<HEADLINE> Dunn, Largent To Give GOP Response </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two House Republicans who tried unsuccessfully  
to unseat their majority leader will deliver the GOP response to 
President Clinton's State of the Union address tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jennifer Dunn of Washington will focus on tax relief and  
Social Security reform. Rep. Steve Largent of Oklahoma will discuss 
education and national defense. Their remarks are expected to be 
broadcast by major TV networks beginning at about 10:30 p.m. EST. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunn and Largent lost their bids to topple House Majority Leader  
Richard Armey, R-Texas, in a caucus election in November. 
</P>
<P>
	The two were chosen by Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., to make the  
GOP response when it appeared he would become the next speaker of 
the House. After Livingston announced that he would forego the 
speakership and leave Congress, his successor, Rep. Dennis Hastert, 
R-Ill, reaffirmed the choice of Dunn and Largent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We both are family people,'' Dunn said between rehearsals  
Monday, adding that she will refer to her children in the address. 
``Steve's been a famous football player, I'm a single mother. We're 
an example of the diversity that we want to see in our party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While she may refer indirectly to the Senate impeachment trial,  
Dunn said, she mostly wants to send messages of optimism and 
reassurance about the GOP agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to get the work done,'' she said. ``The reason we're  
sent back here is to work across the aisle to solve problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dunn and Largent will speak outdoors, from a balcony of the  
Cannon House Office Building. The brightly lit Capitol will be 
visible in the darkness behind them. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hardest part of the whole thing is winnowing it down,''  
Dunn said. ``It's very tough to write a speech for seven minutes.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Again Delays Windows 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Will Windows 2000 make it out in 1999?  
</P>
<P>
	That's the question at least one analyst is raising after  
Microsoft Corp. said it had again pushed back the release of a new 
test version of its Windows 2000 operating system for business 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	In a posting Monday on its Web site, Microsoft said the third  
``beta'' or test version of Windows 2000 is now expected out ``in 
the April 1999 timeframe'' with the final version expected to ship 
in late 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, the product's in great shape and we just want to  
take the extra few days to put the last final touches on it,'' said 
Ed Muth, Microsoft's group manager for enterprise marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	Windows 2000 is Microsoft's most important new product. The  
massive and sophisticated network software program, which will be 
marketed in different versions for customers ranging from 
individual users to giant corporations, will be Microsoft's primary 
operating system for business and large-scale computing. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft officials characterized the latest delay as minor,  
since the most recent date for Beta 3's release had been March. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry analyst Rob Enderle, vice president of Giga Information  
Group in Santa Clara, Calif., suggested, however, that Windows 2000 
might not be ready for sale until June 2000. If so, he said, that 
could hurt Microsoft's financial performance next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The two big products they have coming out over the next year  
are Windows 2000 and Office 2000'' -- the latter an upgrade to 
Microsoft's business software suite, Enderle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many corporate clients might wait to adopt Windows 2000 until  
after it has a track record and the inevitable fixes are issued for 
problems found in use. And many companies likewise won't make the 
switch to Office 2000, due out later this year, until they are 
running the new operating system, Enderle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Software delays are hardly rare at Microsoft. Its flagship  
product, Windows 95 and its successor, Windows 98, both were 
repeatedly postponed as testers found things needing to be fixed. 
</P>
<P>
	Windows 2000, originally known as Windows NT Version 5.0, once  
was expected in 1998. The first test version of the software was 
released in August 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The second beta was due out last June, but wasn't released until  
September. Microsoft originally had planned only a ``Beta 2 
refresh'' rather than a full-scale third beta, but changed its mind 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Muth said the latest delay ``isn't really a question of  
problems'' in the software. Rather, ``it's a question of fit and 
finish work'' to make sure the beta is ready. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our standards for the beta are very, very high,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Concern for Florida Tourist Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Two robberies that left a Canadian man dead and a  
prominent Latin American businesswoman in critical condition have 
sparked concern for tourist safety in south Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The attacks have rekindled memories of tourist killings that  
plagued the state in the early 1990s and have led to worries about 
the area's image during the Jan. 31 Super Bowl at nearby Pro Player 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're at the height of the tourist season, with Super Bowl  
coming,'' Miami-Dade County Manager Merrett Stierheim told the 
Sun-Sentinel of Fort Lauderdale for its Tuesday editions. ``Without 
question, this is a sensitive time for us. ... We're concerned. 
We've been down this road before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Benoit Lessard, 69, a retired truck driver from Quebec, was shot  
through the heart early Sunday by a gunman who may have followed 
him home from Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport to an 
area populated by Canadian snowbirds and retirees. 
</P>
<P>
	He was ambushed one day after wealthy Panamanian Lynn Motta was  
robbed and repeatedly shot at a shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after Lessard was killed, his wife and daughter packed and  
left Miami-Dade County for good. 
</P>
<P>
	Stierheim stressed that Miami-Dade County's crime rate has  
drastically improved since 1993, when three German tourists were 
killed in robberies. ``This is not the Miami we saw in 1993,'' he 
said. ``But it depends on what the media does, especially the 
tabloids. The last time they blew things up. They would be doing a 
tremendous disservice if they did that again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state's tourism industry took two years to recover from the  
effects of 10 tourist-related slayings in 1992 and 1993. Of those 
killings, six were committed in the Miami area. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, the Miami-Dade County created a tourism police  
patrol at Miami International Airport and nearby car rental 
agencies, where much of the crime was occurring. They put up new 
highway signs and created maps to help keep tourists from getting 
lost and venturing into dangerous areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Tourist robberies investigated by the Miami-Dade police  
department have dropped significantly since then, falling 86 
percent from 1992 to 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami-Dade police were still searching for suspects in both  
attacks. They are investigating the possibility that both Lessard 
and Motta were targeted and stalked. 
</P>
<P>
	Motta, shot several times, remained in critical condition  
Tuesday at Jackson Memorial Hospital. Surveillance video from 
inside the mall may show the suspect tailing Motta while she 
shopped, police said. She was shot in the mall's garage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The subject tried to take her purse and she refused to let  
go,'' said Miami-Dade police spokesman detective Rudy Espinosa. 
</P>
<P>
	Tourism officials in Miami-Dade and Broward counties said the  
shootings weren't tourism related, arguing that both victims were 
picked randomly. 
</P>
<P>
	``This doesn't fit the profile of a tourist target,'' said Nicki  
Grossman, president of the Greater Fort Lauderdale Convention &AMP; 
Visitors Bureau. ``If somebody had followed (Lessard) to a hotel 
and done this, it would be a different story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We survey our visitors every month and crime hardly registers  
on the radar screen,'' said William Talbert, acting president and 
chief executive officer of the Greater Miami Convention &AMP; Visitors 
Bureau.

<HEADLINE> McDonald's Names US Marketing Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- McDonald's Corp. on Tuesday named a former Boston  
Chicken Inc. executive as its new head of U.S. marketing, one of 
the fast-food chain's key posts in determining the direction of 
domestic sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oak Brook, Ill.-based chain said it had promoted Larry Zwain  
to the position of senior vice president of marketing, a job in 
which he will report directly to Alan Feldman, the company's 
president of U.S. operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Zwain, who resigned as chief executive of Boston Chicken shortly  
before it filed for bankruptcy protection, had been serving for the 
past 18 months as a regional manager in the company's Northeast 
division. 
</P>
<P>
	Before joining Boston Chicken in 1996, Zwain was president and  
chief operating officer of PepsiCo Inc.'s international restaurants 
business, which has since been spun off into Tricon Global 
Restaurants Inc. comprising Pizza Hut, Kentucky Fried Chicken and 
Taco Bell. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald's has been seeking a successor to longtime marketing  
chief Brad Ball since he left the chain last April for a job at 
Warner Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
	While several high-profile candidates reportedly turned down the  
job, analysts have praised Feldman and company Chairman Jack 
Greenberg for steering the chain in the right direction over the 
past year. 
</P>
<P>
	After months of struggling sales and declining market share, the  
chain last year gained market share and boosted sales at stores 
open at least a year, in part because of such successful promotions 
as Beanie Babies and Monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald's also switched its advertising spending from about 80  
percent on the national level to only 50 percent in order to 
concentrate spending more on local markets, matching its 
realignment of business operations into regional markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Zwain also revealed the company plans to revive its Beanie  
Babies promotion this year, although he declined to discuss 
details. Analysts have said the company's two previous Beanie 
Babies promotions were the most successful in its history and 
contributed significantly to McDonald's bottom line.

<HEADLINE>  British Aerospace Buying Marconi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- British Aerospace PLC is acquiring General  
Electric Co. PLC's Marconi Electronics division for $12.7 billion 
in stock in a deal that creates a British defense group expected to 
rival the American defense giants. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase, announced today, will create the third-largest  
defense and aerospace group in the world after Boeing and Lockheed 
Martin in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined British Aerospace-Marconi defense and aerospace  
business is valued at $25.7 billion at current market prices. 
</P>
<P>
	British Aerospace chairman Sir Richard Evans told a news  
conference the deal ``represents an important step in the 
restructuring of the aerospace and defense industry in Europe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The merged company could be the ``one major player'' to speak  
for Britain in the looming reorganization of Europe's defense 
industry, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the decision disappointed European defense companies, which  
had hoped for a cross-border deal to create a powerful European 
group to rival the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's DaimlerChrysler Aerospace, also known as Dasa, had  
been expected until recently to merge with British Aerospace. In a 
statement, Dasa said the deal would make ``balanced European 
horizontal mergers such as Dasa-BAe impossible and create an 
obstacle to European integration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dasa said it will now consider mergers with other European or  
U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomson-CSF of France, which had wooed Marconi, said it  
disapproved of the merger plan. 
</P>
<P>
	But British Aerospace chief executive John Weston said there was  
``nothing in (today's) announcement that shuts any door'' to a deal 
with Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	He denied that BAe had paid too much for Marconi, but shares in  
both BAe and GEC fell Tuesday on the belief that it had, dealers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	At midday on the London exchange, shares in British Aerospace  
had dropped 11.3 percent while GEC shares were down 4.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, GEC shareholders will receive shares in New  
British Aerospace amounting to just under 37 percent of the 
enlarged business, and will retain their holdings in what is left 
of GEC, which is unrelated to the U.S. conglomerate General 
Electric Co. 
</P>
<P>
	British Aerospace shareholders will have about 63 percent of the  
new aerospace business. 
</P>
<P>
	GEC chief executive Lord Simpson said the merger was  
advantageous for shareholders, giving them a stake in the enlarged 
British Aerospace and a more focused GEC. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies said the merger will lead to annual cost savings  
of about $453.7 million within three years of the deal, probably 
around the end of 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The one-time cost of achieving the savings is about $330 million  
over that three year period. 
</P>
<P>
	British Aerospace and Marconi, which together employ some  
130,000 people worldwide, said the restructuring could result in a 
small number of lost jobs.

<HEADLINE> NATO Generals Warn Yugo Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO generals held six hours of  
``not completely successful'' negotiations Tuesday with hard-line 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic over the escalating violence 
in Kosovo, a Western source close to the talks said. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.N. war crimes investigator, meanwhile, was denied entry into  
Yugoslavia for a second day and an American diplomat expelled after 
accusing Serbs of massacring 45 ethnic Albanians was given 24 more 
hours to remain in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Only three months after Yugoslavia narrowly escaped NATO  
attacks, the Western alliance's top generals returned to Belgrade 
and held talks with Milosevic over the deteriorating situation in 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Western source said the generals were not able to convince  
Milosevic to live up to all conditions laid down by the alliance to 
bring peace to Kosovo but said: ``we made progress in certain 
areas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yugoslav president, however, appeared unimpressed by renewed  
NATO threats of airstrikes -- unlike last October when he agreed to 
a cease-fire in Kosovo. Milosevic's security forces on Tuesday 
defiantly continued bombarding the Racak area where the ethnic 
Albanians were massacred last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of people have fled the region around Racak, southwest  
of the Kosovo capital of Pristina, and scores have been killed in 
five days of heavy fighting. A Serb police commander was shot to 
death Tuesday and two policemen were wounded in clashes with ethnic 
Albanian rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	The Racak massacre discovered last Saturday has prompted world  
outrage at Milosevic and revived calls for NATO military action to 
make the government obey the three-month-old shaky truce. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright warned Tuesday the  
possibility of airstrikes was ``on the table.'' In Washington, 
officials said the United States demanded that Milosevic identify 
who gave the order for the massacre in southern Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	American Gen. Wesley Clark and Germany's Klaus Naumann said  
before Tuesday's meeting that they would deliver a strong warning 
to Milosevic to end the onslaught. The NATO commanders were also to 
demand that those responsible for the massacre be brought to 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Their meeting with Milosevic lasted into the evening, and the  
generals did not comment afterward. They were expected to report 
directly to the NATO leadership in Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
	The generals also insisted that Milosevic reverse a buildup of  
troops and special police in the province where a ceasefire 
negotiated last October is unraveling, State Department spokesman 
James P. Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Monday, Milosevic's government has ordered the American  
head of Kosovo international monitors out of the country and has 
denied entry to the chief prosecutor of the U.N. war crimes court, 
Louise Arbour. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the authorities allowed William Walker, the former  
U.S. ambassador to El Salvador, another 24 hours in Yugoslavia. But 
it was not clear whether the decision to expel Walker would be 
revoked completely. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO and international officials demand that the Yugoslavs let  
Walker stay, allow a war crimes investigation, halt their crackdown 
and withdraw military and special police forces they have sent into 
Kosovo in excess of numbers allowed in the October agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	They say Kosovo Albanians and Yugoslav forces both have violated  
the cease-fire pledge and must work toward a political settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	But a defiant Milosevic might be counting on the international  
discord over NATO attacks against Yugoslavia to pursue his policies 
in Kosovo, where government forces are trying to crush a rebellion 
by majority ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in  
Europe, which runs the monitoring mission, Knut Vollebaek, was 
expected in Belgrade on Wednesday for talks with Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's defense minister, Rudolf Scharping, said he was not  
ready to abandon diplomacy yet for the military option. But Italian 
Premier Massimo D'Alema indicated that NATO would be allowed to use 
Italian bases if it decided to launch airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Any possible airstrike would likely require the exodus first of  
the estimated 700 international monitors in Serbia and orders from 
NATO officials for military action. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said Tuesday  
that NATO warplanes could go on attack within four days if NATO 
chiefs agreed to that. 
</P>
<P>
	Top NATO officials are to meet Wednesday at NATO headquarters to  
discuss the Belgrade talks and the violence in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest Serb police actions followed several attacks by the  
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army and repeated calls by Serb minority in 
Kosovo and ultranationalists that the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army 
be defeated. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic's year-long crackdown against the KLA has claimed as  
many as 2,000 lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelling in the Racak area, about 18 miles southwest of  
Pristina, has driven an estimated 5,300 civilians into the hills.

<HEADLINE> Congress Resuming Legislative Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Top Senate Republicans are unveiling an agenda  
focusing on Social Security, tax cuts and other issues as the new 
Congress begins burrowing into its legislative tasks. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and other Senate GOP  
leaders today planned to reveal their first five bills of the 106th 
Congress, which began its two-year life earlier this month. The 
announcement of each party's initial bills is a biennial ritual 
that each uses to publicize its top priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislative work will begin slowly as usual, with little but  
committee work going on this month. But with polls showing most 
members of the public disenchanted with GOP efforts to remove 
President Clinton from office, Republicans are especially 
interested in demonstrating that they are eager to address issues 
of concern to voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``A good message is the work moves forward,'' said Rep. Jennifer  
Dunn, R-Wash., in an interview Monday. Dunn and Rep. Steve Largent, 
R-Okla., will be delivering the GOP response tonight to Clinton's 
State of the Union address. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Senate Republicans' first five bills will focus on  
Social Security, tax cuts, education, anti-crime and anti-drug 
initiatives, and defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democrats also plan to unveil their top five bills.  
</P>
<P>
	In the House, new Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said Monday he  
would reserve H.R.1, the House's first bill of the new Congress, 
for the president's legislation on strengthening the pension 
program for the elderly and disabled. Clinton has called for 
buttressing the program for the impending retirement of baby 
boomers, but has provided no details on how he would do it and is 
not expected to reveal any soon. 
</P>
<P>
	The flurry of activity comes as lawmakers return to the Capitol  
in full force, in time to hear Clinton's address tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	The House meets Tuesday, but mainly so members can be around for  
Clinton's address in the evening. It will then recess until Feb. 2, 
although many committees will remain at work. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate was meeting briefly this morning for speeches on  
legislation. After lunch, senators will resume their more familiar 
mode of late, hearing the Clinton impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Topping off what will unavoidably be a peculiar day, those same  
senators will then troop across the Capitol after dinner to hear 
the president's address. 
</P>
<P>
	The full Senate's legislative schedule is uncertain after that,  
mainly because of the unsure timing of the impeachment trial. It is 
possible that the Senate will meet for legislative business on 
Wednesday and Friday mornings, though little more than speeches are 
likely because no bills are ready for floor consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Appropriations Committee was planning almost daily  
hearings in preparation for its work later this year on spending 
bills for 2000. GOP leaders want to get those bills finished as 
early as possible, in hopes of avoiding a replay of last fall's 
mammoth $520 billion spending measure, which handed Clinton several 
victories just before the elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Other panels planning early hearings include the Senate Budget  
Committee, with 11 hearings on budget topics; the House Ways and 
Means Committee, at which Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan 
will testify on economic issues; the House's renamed Armed Services 
Committee, which will hear from the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and the 
Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, which will consider 
efforts to impose new controls on health-maintenance organizations.

<HEADLINE> Gov. Ventura's Appointee Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Gov. Jesse Ventura's choice to head  
Minnesota's Department of Natural Resources resigned Tuesday amid a 
furor over his having been ticketed for fish-and-game violations. 
</P>
<P>
	In a state where many are passionate about the environment and  
wilderness pursuits, Alan Horner stepped down after two top 
department officials resigned to protest his appointment. 
</P>
<P>
	Horner said the furor would have made directing the department  
problematic. ``When I weigh my dedication to this job against the 
toll it may take on my personal and family life, my family comes 
first,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura accepted the resignation but said he didn't ask for it.  
</P>
<P>
	When news broke Friday of Horner's violations, Ventura called  
them minor. On Tuesday, the former pro wrestler criticized the 
scrutiny that lead to Horner's departure, saying it could 
discourage others from going into public service. 
</P>
<P>
	``He made a mistake. He got fined. He paid the fine,'' Ventura  
said. ``Shouldn't it have ended there?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The day after Horner's appointment, a tip led reporters to check  
records that showed he had two tickets and a warning for 
fish-and-game violations since 1988. One ticket was for fishing 
without a license, the other for an unlicensed ice fishing house. 
The warning was for hunting grouse without a license, which Horner 
had left in a motel room. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Commissioner Ron Nargang, who planned to leave the agency  
soon anyway, resigned Friday in protest after meeting with Horner. 
Assistant Commissioner Gail Lewellan quit Monday, saying respect 
for fish and game laws has to apply to fish-and-game employees, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
	Department employees said that during a meeting after the  
violations became public, Horner derided agency game wardens as 
``crappie cops,'' a reference to a small game fish. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics said that remark may have hurt him more than the  
violations did. 
</P>
<P>
	``To refer disparagingly to conservation officers -- that's an  
extraordinarily difficult job in this state,'' said Ginny Yingling, 
state director for the Sierra Club. 
</P>
<P>
	The appointment was subject to Senate approval, but that is  
normally considered a formality. Horner had already taken the oath 
of office. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewellan would not comment on whether she would return to  
the department now that Horner is out. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura, a third-party candidate elected in November in a  
startling upset for both the Democrats and the Republicans, has 
appointed a little more than half of his Cabinet so far. Many of 
the appointees could be considered political insiders -- either 
holdovers from Gov. Arne Carlson's administration or people with 
government experience -- but a few, including Horner, were 
surprises. Horner's appointment is the first to fail. 
</P>
<P>
	Horner, 52, has no experience in state government but has an  
undergraduate degree in zoology and a master's in business. He owns 
a business that manufactures architectural woodwork for commercial 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Ventura, he is a former Navy SEAL. The two did not know  
each other until after Ventura's election, when Horner sent in a 
resume to Ventura, who admitted the SEAL service caught his eye. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ventura administration promised no repeat of the appointment  
furor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the next time the governor decides on a DNR  
commissioner, we will check the DNR records,'' said John Wodele, 
Ventura's spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Complaints by Federal Workers Swell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government spent at least $866 million  
during the 1990s investigating and settling a growing number of 
federal employee complaints alleging discrimination and other 
mistreatment, an Associated Press review of government records 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Employee complaints are on the rise even while the federal work  
force is shrinking. Employment experts say government workers are 
bigger complainers than private sector employees because they're 
more sensitive about their rights and more aware of how to use the 
government's multi-layered redress system. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've made it very easy for people to complain,'' said Nancy  
Vollertsen, a Minneapolis attorney practicing employment law. 
</P>
<P>
	Downsizing seems to have contributed to the complaints. Between  
1990 and 1997, the government's civilian payroll fell from 3.1 
million to 2.8 million, increasing competition for jobs and 
complaints from those laid off. Other causes include greater 
sensitivity to discrimination, changes in the law and a 
multilayered grievance process that doesn't exist at private 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Private firms also get worker complaints. But in studying 10  
years of complaints, the Senior Executive Association, a federal 
managers group, said government employees file seven times as many 
complaints as workers at private companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Walter Thomas filed a complaint contending the State Department  
unfairly denied him job assignments because he is black. ``The 
system accepts blacks as long as they stay in positions and never 
rise to the top,'' Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	His case evolved into a class-action lawsuit for black foreign  
service officers that took 10 years and $3.8 million to settle. The 
1996 agreement also included costs more difficult to tally -- 
promotions for some officers and diversity training. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP review of federal records found that from 1990 through  
1997, the government spent $378 million on counselors, judges and 
investigators who handle complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	An additional $488 million went to employees who won  
compensation awards ranging from a few thousand dollars to millions 
for class-action lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	No single agency tracks all worker complaints or costs. The AP  
reviewed documents from the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission, the Merit System Protection Board, the U.S. Special 
Counsel and the Treasury Department Judgment Fund. But many hidden 
costs, such as confidential financial settlements, couldn't be 
calculated. 
</P>
<P>
	Evidence of the upward trend:  
</P>
<P>
	--Civil rights complaints rose 70 percent, from 17,000 cases in  
1990 to nearly 29,000 cases in 1997, a preliminary EEOC report 
indicates. 
</P>
<P>
	--EEOC figures show twice as many employees appealed decisions in  
1997 than they did in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	--The number of workers appealing layoffs to the Merit System  
Protection Board rose from 726 in 1996 to 1,126 one year later. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, one-fifth of the allegations in EEOC complaints  
concerned racial discrimination, mostly toward blacks. But whites 
filed about one-fourth of the race cases, alleging reverse 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some people who just haven't gotten the message''  
despite years of affirmative action programs, said Melodee Stith, 
the Interior Department's equal opportunity director. 
</P>
<P>
	Some critics contend affirmative action programs increase  
tensions and encourage complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as the government pursues race- or gender-based hiring  
policies, you are going to end up offending someone,'' says George 
Nesterczuk, staff director of the House Government Reform and 
Oversight Committee's civil service panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Preliminary EEOC figures for 1997 showed agencies made an  
official finding of discrimination in only 359, or 4 percent, of 
the 8,728 discrimination cases decided by federal agencies. But 
more than 6,000 other cases were resolved with corrective action. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts attribute some of the rise in discrimination complaints  
to a 1991 law enabling federal employees to seek compensatory 
damages of up to $300,000 in such cases and to the 1990 Americans 
With Disabilities Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all employees prevail. Mail carrier Pamela Heintzelman  
claimed disability discrimination after the Postal Service fired 
her, alleging she misrepresented a back injury that kept her from 
working full hours. Postal investigators had videotaped 
Heintzelman, who raises Australian shepherd dogs, running and 
bending at several dog shows while on paid leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Heintzelman said those activities were not the type of  
repetitive movement that hurts her back. She lost in court, but her 
union helped her return to the Postal Service as a clerk. 
</P>
<P>
	The government is trying to reduce complaints.  
</P>
<P>
	The EEOC has proposed ways to streamline complaints processing  
and develop mediation programs. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, Congress authorized federal agencies to use alternative  
dispute resolution, a mediation method popular in the private 
sector. More than 40 agencies are trying it. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the Postal Service, source of the most complaints,  
say employee complaints recently fell by 77 percent in three 
regions offering mediation.

<HEADLINE> HID Headlights Mimic Daylight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Luxury cars have always drawn admiring looks  
for their graceful lines, well-appointed interiors and powerful 
engines. Now they have eye-catching headlights to boot, ones that 
will soon be making it into less costly cars. 
</P>
<P>
	The bright, bluish lights are known as high-intensity discharge  
lamps. They provide about twice the brightness of ordinary 
headlights, closely approximating daylight. At the same time, they 
use less power and can last for 100,000 miles of driving time. 
</P>
<P>
	While HID lights arrived on the scene in high-end cars as a  
$1,000 option, some experts believe they will soon displace halogen 
headlights -- the current technology -- just as other lighting 
systems bettered the oil lamps first used on cars. 
</P>
<P>
	``HID is kind of a prestige thing, but over time, and it will be  
a relatively short period of time, people are going to expect them 
on their car,'' said George Peterson, president of AutoPacific, an 
automotive consulting company. 
</P>
<P>
	Some motorists have complained about being dazzled by the HID  
lights. 
</P>
<P>
	A lighting specialist at the National Highway Traffic Safety  
Administration said some people are more sensitive to light that 
has a blue cast. But he said the lights meet the intensity and beam 
shape standards in place since 1978, the last time the government 
made a major revision of its standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Halogen lamps generate light by heating a tungsten filament  
inside a capsule filled with halogen gas. The gas helps prevent 
blackening of the capsule as the filament slowly burns out. 
</P>
<P>
	High-intensity discharge lamps operate more like vapor-filled  
streetlights. They don't have a filament, but create light by 
zapping an arc between two electrodes. That arc excites a different 
kind of gas, usually xenon, which in turn ignites metallic salts. 
</P>
<P>
	The lights appear brighter to the eye because of their spectral  
content. Although their beams travel no farther or wider than those 
produced by halogen lights, they contain more light at the margins. 
The light fades less at the edges. 
</P>
<P>
	The light also appears blue, although it can go through a  
spectrum of colors as it passes through tinted glass and rear view 
mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
	More powerful headlights have long been popular in Europe, where  
driving speeds can double those in the United States. Over the past 
few years, American car buyers have started ordering HID lamps as 
an option. 
</P>
<P>
	Eager to tap the market, lighting companies are now  
investigating two other options for HID lamps. One is as a 
replacement bulb for existing halogen headlights. The other is as 
an auxiliary light, such as a fog lamp. 
</P>
<P>
	``The light is amazing and customers love them,'' said Lou  
Brown, a salesman at a Lexus dealership in Alexandria, Va.

<HEADLINE> California Locals Criticize Drug Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDWAY, Calif. (AP) -- The annual harvest-season hunts for  
marijuana fields by drug agents in low-flying helicopters routinely 
kill birds, stampede farm animals, violate environmental laws and 
terrify innocent homeowners, residents of California's rugged north 
country testified Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to be here to see what it is like -- from the first of  
August through September, it's like a war zone,'' said Dan Weaver. 
</P>
<P>
	Weaver and two dozen others testified at a public hearing  
ordered as part of a settlement in a lawsuit challenging 
``Operation Greensweep,'' an August 1990 drug raid. 
</P>
<P>
	``The big problem is these helicopters. This whole thing would  
be calmed down significantly by getting those guys up higher,'' 
Weaver said. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents complained that their privacy and property were  
violated and said the propellor wash from the helicopters killed 
birds and spooked livestock. 
</P>
<P>
	Last June, the settlement called on the Bureau of Land  
Management to draw up a handbook for its drug raiders. The 
guidelines are expected to be released in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Denson said helicopters buzzed his barn and frightened his  
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``They say they fly at 500 feet, but actually, they're coming in  
at 200 feet. We're saying the handbook should require them to fly 
at least 1,000 to 1,500 feet,'' said Denson, who lives in Redway, 
about 220 miles north of San Francisco in Humboldt County. 
</P>
<P>
	Redway is within the so-called ``Emerald Triangle'' made up of  
Humboldt, Mendocino and Trinity counties. The region is known for 
its lush wilderness, where many marijuana growers operate.

	Clinton Lays Out Ambitious Agenda  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite the threat of his removal from office,  
President Clinton tonight outlined his plan for the next two years, 
putting Social Security at the top of his agenda. In his State of 
the Union address, Clinton urged new spending for child care, 
education, crime-fighting, the environment and the Pentagon. He 
called for raising the minimum wage by $1 an hour over two years to 
$6.15 and announced that the Justice Department will sue the 
tobacco industry to recover billions of dollars in health care 
costs spent on smokers. He made no mention of his impeachment but 
backed House Speaker Dennis Hastert's call for Republicans and 
Democrats to work in a spirit of bipartisanship and civility. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Offers Social Security Plan  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's proposal to shore up  
Social Security would use budget surpluses and create separate 
401(k)-style accounts for most working Americans. It would be the 
first time the government could invest some of Social Security's 
cash reserves in the stock market. ``It will open the doors to all 
kinds of mischief involving government dictates, favoritism and 
cronyism,'' warned Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas. But Republicans also 
have made reforming the nation's retirement system a priority too 
this year, with party leaders even offering to introduce 
legislation Clinton recommends. 

</P>
<P>
	Defense Team Presents Clinton's Side  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- White House Counsel Charles Ruff opened  
President Clinton's impeachment defense with a fervent plea to the 
senators who will decide the president's fate: ``He must not be 
removed from office.'' Ruff declared that ``William Jefferson 
Clinton is not guilty of the charges'' leveled by the House, 
including perjury and obstruction of justice in the cover-up of his 
affair with Monica Lewinsky. Ruff offered a point-by-point rebuttal 
of each allegation, criticized Kenneth Starr's handling of Linda 
Tripp and accused the House of ``prosecutorial ... fudge.''

	NATO Generals Warn Yugo Leader  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The State Department acknowledged  
that a meeting between NATO officials and Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic to end the violence in Kosovo appeared to have 
made little headway. A defiant Milosevic defended Yugoslavia's 
crackdown in Kosovo, telling NATO's two top generals that he has a 
``right to fight against terrorism.'' Milosevic's security forces 
also continued bombarding the Racak area where the ethnic Albanians 
were massacred last weekend. 

</P>
<P>
	Court To Decide on Internet Porn  
</P>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Justice Department and the American  
Civil Liberties Union will square off before a judge tomorrow over 
a federal law requiring companies to keep Internet material 
considered ``harmful to minors'' away from children. The Child 
Online Protection Act would require some commercial Web sites to 
collect a credit card number or some other access code as proof of 
age. The ACLU's legal director argues that the law will turn the 
Internet into an ``often meaningless means of communicating only 
about things that are fit for a 6-year-old.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Disputed Stem Cell Research Financed  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is about to finance  
research using the body's own ``master cells'' -- the building 
blocks of tissue that scientists have culled from human embryos. 
Studying how to harness these embryonic stem cells and turn them 
into therapies for Alzheimer's disease or diabetes is considered 
one of the most promising new frontiers of science. The head of the 
National Institutes for Health said a federal ban on human embryo 
research does not apply to these studies because the 
laboratory-grown cells could never grow into an entire human being.

	New Weight-Loss Drug Called Safe  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- An advisory panel to the FDA has judged an  
experimental diet drug to be safe and effective enough for the U.S. 
market. Orlistat, trade-named Xenical, helped obese people shed 
pounds and keep them off in a two-year study, according to 
researchers. The drug, manufactured by Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., 
blocks absorption of about one-third of fat that people consume, 
researchers said.

<HEADLINE> Missouri Sues Hog Producing Farm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Missouri sued its largest hog producer,  
alleging a pattern of pollution by Premium Standard Farms and 
seeking a halt to its massive breeding operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Jay Nixon asked in a lawsuit Tuesday that hog  
breeding by Premium Standard be stopped until a judge of the 
Jackson County Circuit Court approves plans for managing the hog 
waste from feedlots that each house thousands of swine. 
</P>
<P>
	Premium Standard ``has failed in its obligations to obey the  
law, to not despoil the environment, and to be a good neighbor to 
those Missourians whose families have been farming this land for 
generations,'' Nixon said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The violations have been numerous, they have been ongoing and,  
in some cases, they have been unreported,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Premium Standard Farms, headquartered in Kansas City, had no  
immediate comment on the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Continental Grain Co. bought controlling interest in  
Premium Standard Farms, which is the nation's third-largest hog 
producer. Recently, Continental initiated an internal environmental 
audit of its operations and turned over possible violations it has 
uncovered. It had promised to continue such audits. 
</P>
<P>
	Nixon said the lawsuit, which seeks court-ordered penalties for  
pollution, was filed after talks broke down between his office and 
Premium Standard. 
</P>
<P>
	Nixon said the attorney general's office ended the talks after  
learning that Premium Standard had spread too much hog waste on 
agricultural land even as the discussions were under way. 
</P>
<P>
	Nixon said the sheer amount of hog manure and urine being  
generated by the company's operations in three adjoining northern 
Missouri counties -- Mercer, Putnam and Sullivan -- has had ``a 
profound negative impact'' on the quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
	Premium Standard ``can and should implement available technology  
to reduce those odors,'' Nixon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say Premium Standard's operations have helped revive  
the rural economy in northern Missouri through good paychecks and 
stable incomes. Its plants use high technology to breed hogs, 
fatten them and send them to market.

<HEADLINE> Subpoenas Issued in Salt Lake Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The former secretary to the man who led  
Salt Lake's bid effort for the 2002 Winter Games will tell federal 
investigators on Wednesday that she was just doing as she was told. 
</P>
<P>
	David Watkiss said that Stephanie Pate was subpoenaed to appear  
before a federal grand jury here on Wednesday, but asked instead to 
meet with investigators privately. 
</P>
<P>
	Pate, who was the secretary to Tom Welch, the man who led the  
effort to win the Games for Salt Lake, was not a ``player,'' in the 
actions that have given rise to allegations of bribery, Watkiss 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just did what we were instructed to do,'' Watkiss said,  
using the plural form lawyers sometimes use for their clients. 
</P>
<P>
	Watkiss said he assumes investigators want to ask Pate what has  
been in the news -- lavish gifts, cash, scholarships and free 
medical care given to International Olympic Committee members by 
Salt Lake bid boosters. 
</P>
<P>
	The top two executives of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee  
have resigned, and Welch, who resigned amid a spousal abuse charge 
in 1997, was stripped of his consulting contract and pension. 
</P>
<P>
	In interviews last week, Welch admitted giving $50,000 in cash  
to an African IOC member who said he needed the money for poor 
childrens' sports programs and $10,000 to the mayoral election 
campaign of an IOC member in Chile. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to meet with the government tomorrow and then the  
government can decide whether it wishes to present Ms. Pate before 
a grand jury,'' Watkiss said. ``The grand jury appearance can be 
much shorter once the government understands what she knows and 
what she doesn't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyer said he had advised Pate against talking to other  
investigators looking into the Olympic mess until after she talks 
with the Department of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our bottom line is we're trying to cooperate with the  
Department of Justice investigation to the best of our ability,'' 
Watkiss said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other lawyers representing key players in Salt Lake's bid have  
either not returned calls or made no comments when contacted by The 
Associated Press on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A Justice Department official confirmed that more than one  
subpoena for grand jury testimony has been issued. 
</P>
<P>
	The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, would not say  
who or how many received subpoenas or when they were called to 
appear before the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Two federal grand juries are regularly empaneled in Salt Lake  
and at least one meets on Wednesdays. 
</P>
<P>
	Beside the SLOC resignations in recent weeks, the casualties of  
the scandal so far have been a top U.S. Olympic Committee who 
resigned last week after revealing a business relationship with 
Welch; and IOC member Pirjo Haeggman of Finland, who resigned on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	A probe by an independent Salt Lake ethics committee is due Feb.  
11 but could be finished sooner, and the USOC investigation should 
be finished in February. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department investigation into possible fraud and  
bribery is being led by Richard Wiedis, a former bank-fraud 
prosecutor from Washington who is working in Salt Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI spokesman George Dougherty said Tuesday the investigation  
likely will take months. 
</P>
<P>
	``These types of investigations take a long time ... but we  
understand the urgency here to get this matter resolved quickly and 
so we're going to expedite our investigation,'' Dougherty said. 
``Obviously, we don't want it to drag out for a year or so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In complex white collar crimes, it's not unusual for prosecutors  
to go before a grand jury many times as they build their case, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to give specifics about the status of the  
investigation or whether the grand jury would hear evidence on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Deseret News has reported the Internal Revenue Service and  
the U.S. Customs Service have joined the FBI in examining 
allegations swirling about Salt Lake's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS would look at whether Salt Lake Olympics bid and  
organizing officials failed to list money paid for scholarships, 
gifts and cash contributions on tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
	Customs has been asked to look at allegations that bid officials  
took large amounts of cash with them to Budapest in June 1995, when 
the International Olympic Committee selected Salt Lake to host the 
2002 Winter Games, according to the Deseret News.

<HEADLINE> For Clinton, It Was Big a Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	From the rap of one gavel sealing President Clinton's  
impeachment to the bang of another opening his State of the Union 
address, it was a month of drama and denial and distractions: 
</P>
<P>
	Dec. 19 -- The House impeached Clinton on charges of perjury and  
obstructing justice. At a post-vote pep rally, Clinton clung to his 
wife's hand and vowed not to vacate the Oval Office ``until the 
last hour of the last day of my term.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dec. 20 -- Overnight, Clinton's job approval rating soared from  
68 percent to 72 percent in an NBC poll. Another survey showed 
Republicans with their worst popularity rating in 14 years. An 
angry parishioner confronted Clinton outside church: ``Damn you, 
for what you've done to the nation!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dec. 21 -- Time magazine announced Clinton and his prosecutor,  
Kenneth Starr, share the 1998 distinction of ``Man of the Year.'' 
Investors shrugged off impeachment and sent the Dow surging 175 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Dec. 22 -- America yawned. Only one-third of American adults told  
a Pew Research survey they paid very close attention to the House 
votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Dec. 23 -- House Repubican Whip Tom DeLay pressed senators to  
read ``reams of evidence that have not been publicly aired.'' The 
Buffalo Bills and New York Jets proved a bigger draw to TV viewers 
than the House impeachment votes, according to Nielsen ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	Dec. 29 -- Senate Republican Leader Trent Lott set the date for  
Clinton's trial. Gawkers descended on Greenville, Tenn., where a 
traditional birthday wreath from Clinton was placed on the grave of 
Andrew Johnson, the only other U.S. president to be impeached. 
</P>
<P>
	Dec. 30 -- Lott floated a plan short-circuiting Clinton's trial.  
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde said it would 
``sacrifice substance and duty for speed.'' Andean soothsayers in 
Peru officially predicted Clinton would survive. 
</P>
<P>
	Dec. 31 -- The Gallup Poll's annual survey named Clinton and his  
wife, Hillary, America's ``most admired'' man and woman. Pope John 
Paul II was runner-up in the male category. Chief Justice William 
H. Rehnquist toured the Senate chamber in preparation for the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 1 -- Clinton opened the year with a midnight kiss for his  
wife and a call for Washington to ``move away from the politics of 
personal destruction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 3 -- Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., said it would be ``unseemly  
and distracting'' for Clinton to deliver the State of the Union 
speech at the same time as his impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 4 -- After a ceremonial swearing-in, the 106th Congress'  
first order of business in the House was to name prosecutors for 
Clinton's trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 6 -- Clinton celebrated a projected budget surplus of more  
than $76 billion for this year. New House Speaker Dennis Hastert 
asked Congress to rise from its ``pool of bitterness.'' Democratic 
leader Dick Gephardt proposed, ``Let's bury the hatchet.'' Supreme 
Court sources promised Rehnquist would preside over Clinton's trial 
in a gold-striped robe inspired by a costume in a Gilbert and 
Sullivan comic opera. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 7 -- Senators sworn in as jurors signed an oath book with  
souvenir pens misprinted ``Untied States Senator.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 8 -- Unemployment hit a 41-year peacetime low. ``Most things  
are going right for our country,'' Clinton exalted. The Dow shot up 
106 points. Senators reveled in self-congratulation after putting 
off partisan debate on trial witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 9 -- Lott pledged ``above all, fairness.''  
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 11 -- In trial filings, the White House said perjury and  
obstruction are not impeachable. GOP lawmakers rebutted: ``If this 
is not enough, what is?'' Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt 
held a California sideshow ``outing'' House prosecutor Bob Barr as 
an alleged hypocrite. Clinton danced the tango. NASA pronounced 
1998 the hottest year on record. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 12 -- The House prosecutors' argument ``reads like a cheap  
mystery,'' snickered White House press secretary Joe Lockhart. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 13 -- Clinton agreed with the three-fourths of Americans in  
a CBS poll who said he needn't mention the scandal in his State of 
the Union: ``I think the American people have heard about that 
quite extensively over the last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 14 -- On Trial Day 1, House prosecutors accused Clinton of  
``egregious and criminal'' acts. Newcomer Peter Fitzgerald, a GOP 
senator from Illinois, was numb from six hours of sitting. ``Those 
chairs are more museum pieces,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 15 -- Draped with praise on Wall Street, Clinton joked it  
was ``the sort of thing people say for your funeral. I don't think 
we're there yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 16 -- Clinton must be removed or else the presidency would  
be ``deeply and perhaps permanently damaged,'' Hyde said in closing 
the House presentation. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 18 -- Witnesses ``may be inevitable'' sighed Senate  
Democratic leader Tom Daschle. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 19 -- White House Counsel Charles F.C. Ruff began Clinton's  
trial defense. ``Are we at that horrific moment in our history when 
our union can be preserved only by taking the step that the framers 
saw as a last resort?'' Ruff asked. Clinton took to the well of the 
House chamber to address Congress and the nation.

<HEADLINE> Indian, Pakistani Forces Clash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SRINAGAR, India (AP) -- Indian troops today clashed with  
Pakistani soldiers who tried to seize a military post on a glacier 
in disputed Kashmir, killing four Pakistani soldiers, a news agency 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The clash took place after nearly 20 Pakistani soldiers advanced  
toward Indian-held territory on the Siachen glacier, the Press 
Trust of India news agency said, quoting an Indian military 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indian soldiers opened fire and later saw the Pakistanis  
retreating carrying the bodies of four soldiers, the report said. 
There was no immediate comment by the Pakistan government. 
</P>
<P>
	The glacier, located 20,000 feet above sea level, is the world's  
highest battle ground. Today's clash was the first this year, 
although skirmishes on the frozen battlefield are common. The two 
sides clashed at least 11 times in 1998, the military statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	India and Pakistan have fought two wars over disputed Kashmir in  
the past 51 years. India controls two-thirds of Kashmir and 
Pakistan controls the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, celebrations ending the holy Muslim fasting month of  
Ramadan were marred today by two clashes between Muslim separatists 
and soldiers that left six men dead in Kashmir, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldiers acting on a tip searched a neighborhood in Thuntwaliwar  
Ganderbull, 25 miles north of Kashmir's summer capital of Srinagar. 
Police said militants opened fire during the search, setting off an 
exchange in which four militants were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar incident in Lalpur Lolab, a village 75 miles north of  
Srinagar, killed two militants. No soldiers were killed or injured 
in either incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of groups in Kashmir, India's only Muslim majority state,  
have been fighting government troops since 1989 to secede from 
predominantly Hindu India, either to become independent or join 
with the neighboring Islamic country of Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> Obstacles for Social Security Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- President Clinton wants to invest nearly $700  
billion in Social Security reserves in stocks, but market watchers 
believe the ambitious plan will face too many political obstacles 
to have much impact on the long-running bull market. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's proposal, unveiled Tuesday in his State of the Union  
address, also must conquer worries about the wisdom of investing 
Americans' retirement money in potentially volatile stocks -- 
especially amid persistent fears that stock prices may already be 
too high. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ultimately, I think it happens -- but I think it happens with  
such a small sliver of the Social Security pie that it will not 
have a noteworthy effect on stocks in the near term,'' said Charles 
Crane, chief market strategist at Key Asset Management. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton proposed using more than $2.7 trillion in expected  
budget surpluses over the next 15 years -- or 62 percent of the 
total -- to directly bolster Social Security's cash reserves. Of 
that, nearly $700 billion would be invested in the stock market by 
an independent government board in hopes of gaining higher returns. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest would be kept, as they are now, in safer but  
historically lower-yielding U.S. Treasury bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people across the country are going to get a better  
deal on Social Security if that happens, if the historical 
relationship and trends continue as they have for the entire 
century,'' said Robert Robbins, a bullish market strategist at 
Robinson-Humphrey Co. ``Investing long-term, equities are the way 
to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But standing in the proposal's path are Republicans who oppose  
government participation in private financial markets, preferring 
to see Social Security money diverted into personal accounts. 
Clinton is siding with Democrats who say that would expose 
Americans to too much financial risk. 
</P>
<P>
	``So far the market regards this possible outcome with keen  
interest, but without tremendous conviction,'' said Tom Madden, 
chief investment officer for domestic equities at Federated 
Investors. ``Given the president's current difficulties and the 
entire focus of the Congress on the impeachment trial, how fast 
such an initiative could go forward is an open question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fears also remain that stocks have climbed too fast and are too  
risky. Indeed, blue-chip stocks managed only a slight gain Tuesday 
as investors worried that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan 
might attempt to cool the market's recent advances in testimony to 
Congress today. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are probably scratching their heads and saying the  
Social Security system ... is missing out on great investment 
opportunities by not having been in the market in the last eight 
years. But widows and orphans also haven't lost money either at any 
point,'' said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jeffries &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very difficult to explain to people: 'You lost money, you  
lost part of your Social Security, because we made bad investment 
decisions,''' Hogan said. ``That can't happen in the boring old 
bonds that they're invested in now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also proposed that another 11 percent of the total  
surplus, about $500 billion, would go to subsidize new accounts to 
supplement Social Security benefits that would be similar to the 
401(k) plans many companies offer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton plan promises to pour millions more into the market,  
but the more significant impact may be psychological, said Robbins. 
</P>
<P>
	``It adds a little more credibility to the stock market and may  
cause people to separately move more money from relatively 
low-return investments and realize that long-term stocks are the 
place to be,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Brazil Senate OKs Austerity Measure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRASILIA, Brazil -- Brazil's Senate passed a key austerity  
measure Tuesday, boosting a government drive to shore up the 
country's ailing economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The 81-seat Senate voted 64-12 to raise a tax on all financial  
transactions from 0.2 to 0.38 percent. The measure, expected to 
yield $9.6 billion a year, will now go to the other house of 
Congress, the Chamber of Deputies, for two full votes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate vote is a boost for Brazil after it devalued its  
currency last week, losing the cornerstone of its economic 
stabilization plan: a strong currency pegged to the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	A dollar peg can make a currency more stable, but it also  
obligates the country adopting it to defend the currency's value 
with such measures as raising interest rates or buying the currency 
on the open market with foreign exchange reserves. Brazil had taken 
both measures to support its real, exacerbating its economic 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the devaluation, attention has switched to Congress as it  
votes on an austerity plan aimed at saving $17.9 billion in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chamber of Deputies will vote Wednesday on a more  
controversial measure that would reduce civil servants' pensions by 
as much as 25 percent. The bill, expected to yield about $2.6 
billion a year, would then go to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they manage that it would be a neat show of force that  
Congress has done some wham-bam quick measures,'' said David 
Fleischer, a professor of political science at the University of 
Brasilia. 
</P>
<P>
	But Fleischer pointed out that about 120 Federal Deputies in the  
513-seat chamber receive pensions and would be voting themselves a 
25 percent cut. 
</P>
<P>
	The global financial crisis hit Brazil in August, when investors  
withdrew their money for fear that the government couldn't cover a 
$65 billion budget deficit and might default on its loans. 
</P>
<P>
	An emergency credit line of $41.5 billion put together by the  
International Monetary Fund helped shore up confidence in the 
country's economy, but the money was conditioned on approval of 
tough austerity measures. 
</P>
<P>
	When Congress balked on a similar pensions bill in December,  
investor confidence flagged and billions of dollars fled the 
country, forcing the government to devalue its currency, the real. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States fears that if Brazil suffers an Asian-style  
currency crisis, its economy could hurt other countries in the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
	However, World Bank President James Wolfensohn said in  
Washington on Tuesday that Latin American countries were dealing 
well with Brazil's financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Nose-diving currencies and a loss of investor confidence could  
cause a regional economic contraction, which in turn would affect 
U.S. exports and hurt the U.S. economy, which has about 2,000 
American multinationals doing business in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sao Paulo Stock Exchange responded positively to the  
devaluation, climbing an astonishing 33.4 percent Friday -- the day 
the government removed restrictions of currency trading -- and 5.4 
percent Monday. On Tuesday, apparently spurred by the Senate's 
vote, the stock exchange closed up a further 3.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the real closed slightly stronger: at 1.56 to the  
dollar compared to Monday's close of 1.59. That amounts to a 
decline of 22 percent since the government began a series of steps 
last week to devalue it. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the reason for the devaluation was to give the government  
some room to lower interest rates, raised to stem the flow of 
dollars out of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	But those interest rates -- some of the highest in the world at  
around 29 percent -- were crippling the economy and also forcing 
Brazil's public sector debt to grow exponentially. It now stands at 
around 8 percent of Brazil's gross domestic product (GDP). 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, however, the government hiked interest rates to  
around 32 percent to head off inflationary pressures. By raising 
rates, analysts say, the government also gains more bargaining 
power to convince the opposition to pass the reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Pedro Malan told reporters in Washington it was  
too early to estimate the impact of the rates on the country's 
burgeoning public deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Malan has been in Washington since Friday, attending meetings  
with the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the 
Inter-American Development Bank and the U.S. Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil has received about $9 billion of the IMF-led rescue  
package and is now seeking the release of another $9 billion 
installment.

<HEADLINE> $470M Shipbuilding Merger Completed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (AP) -- A $470 million merger will combine  
Newport News Shipbuilding and Avondale Industries and create a 
company that can design, build and maintain every type of warship 
in the Navy fleet. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company will be known as Newport News Avondale  
Industries and will have almost 24,000 employees. It will have 
estimated 1999 revenues of $2.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Byron Callan, a shipbuilding industry analyst at Merrill Lynch  
in New York, said the merger announced Tuesday reflects a trend 
that is likely to continue among ship construction companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been an ongoing process,'' said Callan. ``... It  
looks like you're going to have two yards, possibly three, when all 
is said and done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The transaction approved by the boards of directors of the two  
companies will give Avondale shareholders 1.196 shares of Newport 
News stock for each share of Avondale stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger is subject to approval by the shareholders of both  
companies and by federal regulators. The deal is expected to close 
in the second quarter of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport News Shipbuilding builds and maintains all of the Navy's  
aircraft carriers and many of its submarines.The New Orleans-based 
Avondale Industries builds many Navy surface warships. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company's chief competitors will be General Dynamics,  
which owns Electric Boat, Bath Iron Works and National Steel and 
Shipbuilding Co., and Litton Industries, parent of Ingalls 
Shipbuilding. 
</P>
<P>
	William P. Fricks, chairman and chief executive officer of  
Newport News Shipbuilding, noted that the combined company will 
have operations on the East, West and Gulf coasts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our geographic diversity enhances the combined company's  
ability to deliver high-quality, cost-effective fleet maintenance 
services to the U.S. Navy, and arguably makes us the most capable 
and flexible shipbuilder in the nation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fricks will become chairman and chief executive in the new  
company, and Albert L. Bossier Jr., will serve as vice chairman 
while remaining president and chief executive of Avondale. 
</P>
<P>
	Fricks said the new company will start with a $6 billion backlog  
in contract work. The total includes more than $2.5 billion for 
aircraft carrier construction, refueling and maintenance through 
2002. Submarine construction programs represent nearly $1 billion, 
and the first two ships of a new class of amphibious assault ships 
represent $2 billion.

<HEADLINE>  Brazil Senate OKs Austerity Measure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's Congress turned in a mixed  
performance Tuesday as investors the world over watched nervously 
to see if Brazil could keep its economy on track after a nearly 25 
percent currency devaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	Boosting Brazil's ailing economy, the Senate voted 64-12 to  
approve a financial transactions tax that is expected to yield $9.6 
billion a year for depleted government coffers. The bill must now 
go to the other house of Congress, the Chamber of Deputies, for two 
full votes. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a more controversial measure on cutting pensions, which  
government allies in the Chamber had hoped to vote on Wednesday, 
was put off for at least another day. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chamber will decide Wednesday when to vote on the measure,  
which would raise about $2.6 billion a year by slashing civil 
servants' pensions by as much as 25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil roiled world markets on Jan. 13 when it attempted a  
limited devaluation of its currency, the real. But two days later, 
markets rallied after Brazil stopped using its foreign reserves to 
buy up reals. 
</P>
<P>
	All told, the real has lost 24 percent of its value.  
</P>
<P>
	Since keeping its currency strong against the dollar was the  
cornerstone of Brazil's economic stabilization plan, it must now 
rely on Congress to implement austerity measures aimed at saving 
about $17.9 billion in 1999 if it is to keep the economy from 
spiraling out of control. 
</P>
<P>
	Silvio Camargo, head of international institutional equity sales  
for Banco Fator in Sao Paulo, said the pension-cutting vote is 
essential to show investors Brazil is back on track. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like the government has enough support to pass it,  
but any setbacks would increase turbulence a lot,'' he said, adding 
that Congress' failure to pass a similar bill in December was 
largely responsible for the current crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	However, about 120 Federal Deputies in the 513-seat chamber  
receive pensions and would be voting themselves a 25 percent cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Variations on the measure have already been voted down four  
times and the government probably accepted the postponement fearing 
that failure to pass it could have terrible repercussions.

 *UNDATED: do this.    	
</P>
<P>
	Here's some good news. In the past six years, we have cut the  
welfare rolls nearly in half. Two years ago from this podium, I 
asked five companies to lead a national effort to hire people off 
welfare. Tonight, our Welfare to Work Partnership includes 10,000 
companies who have hired hundreds of thousands of people. And our 
balanced budget will help another 200,000 people move to the 
dignity and pride of work. I hope you will support it. 
</P>
<P>
	We must do more to bring the spark of private enterprise to  
every corner of America, to build a bridge from Wall Street to 
Appalachia to the Mississippi Delta to our Native American 
communities. With more support for community development banks, for 
empowerment zones; for 100,000 more vouchers for affordable 
housing. And I ask Congress to support our bold new plan to help 
businesses raise up to $15 billion in private sector capital to 
bring jobs and opportunities to our inner cities and rural areas -- 
with tax credits and loan guarantees, including the new American 
Private Investment Companies modeled on the Overseas Private 
Investment Company. 
</P>
<P>
	Thank you.  
</P>
<P>
	Now, for years and years and years we've had this OPIC, this  
Overseas Private Investment Corporation, because we knew we had 
untapped markets overseas. But our greatest untapped markets are 
not overseas, they are right here at home and we should go after 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Now we must work hard to help bring prosperity back to the  
family farm. You know -- as this Congress knows very well, dropping 
prices and the loss of foreign markets have devastated too many 
family farms. Last year the Congress provided substantial 
assistance to help stave off a disaster in American agriculture, 
and I am ready to work with lawmakers of both parties to create a 
farm safety net that will include crop insurance reform and farm 
income assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	I actually do -- I ask you to join with me and do this. This  
should not be a political issue. Everyone knows what an economic 
problem is going on out there in rural America today, and we need 
an appropriate means to address it. Thank you. 
</P>
<P>
	We must strengthen our lead in technology. It was government  
investment that led to the creation of the Internet. I propose a 28 
percent increase in long-term computing research. 
</P>
<P>
	We also must be ready for the 21st century, from its very first  
moment, by solving the so-called ``Y2K'' computer problem. Now, we 
had one member of Congress stand up and applaud and we may have 
about that ratio out there applauding at home in front of their 
television sets. But remember, this is a big, big problem. And 
we've been working hard on it. Already we've made sure that the 
Social Security checks will come on time. And I -- but I want all 
the folks at home listening to this to know that we need every 
state and local government, every business, large and small, to 
work with us to make sure that this Y2K computer bug will be 
remembered as the last headache of the 20th century, not the first 
crisis of the 21st. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, for our own prosperity, we must support economic growth  
abroad. You know, until recently, a third of our economic growth 
came from exports. But over the past year and a half, financial 
turmoil overseas has put that growth at risk. Today much of the 
world is in recession, with Asia hit especially hard. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the most serious financial crisis in half a century. To  
meet it, the United States and other nations have reduced interest 
rates and strengthened the International Monetary Fund. And while 
the turmoil is not over, we have worked very hard with other 
nations to contain it. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, we have to continue to work on the long-term  
project, building a global financial system for the 21st Century 
that promotes prosperity and tames the cycles of boom and bust that 
has engulfed so much of Asia. This June I will meet with other 
world leaders to advance this historic purpose. And I ask all of 
you to support our endeavors. 
</P>
<P>
	I also ask you to support creating a freer and fairer trading  
system for 21st century America. 
</P>
<P>
	I'd like to say something really serious to everyone in this  
chamber in both parties. I think trade has divided us and divided 
Americans outside this chamber for too long. Somehow we have to 
find a common ground on which business and workers, and 
environmentalists, and farmers and government can stand together. I 
believe these are the things we ought to all agree on. So let me 
try. 
</P>
<P>
	First, we ought to tear down barriers, open markets and expand  
trade. But at the same time, we must ensure that ordinary citizens 
in all countries actually benefit from trade -- a trade that 
promotes the dignity of work -- and the rights of workers, and 
protects the environment. We must insist that international trade 
organizations be open to public scrutiny instead of mysterious, 
secret things subject to wild criticism. When you come right down 
to it, now that the world economy is becoming more and more 
integrated, we have to do in the world what we spent the better 
part of this century doing here at home -- we have got to put a 
human face on the global economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Now we, we must enforce our trade laws when imports unlawfully  
flood our nation. I have, I have already informed the government of 
Japan that if that nation's sudden surge of steel imports into our 
country is not reversed, America will respond. 
</P>
<P>
	We must help all American manufacturers hit hard by the present  
crisis -- with loan guarantees and other incentives to increase 
American exports by nearly $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	I'd like to believe we can achieve a new consensus on trade  
based on these principles, and I ask the Congress again to join me 
in this common approach and to give the president the trade 
authority long used, and now overdue and necessary, to advance our 
prosperity in the 21st century. (Applause.) 
</P>
<P>
	Tonight, I also issue a call to the nations of the world to join  
the United States in a new round of global trade negotiation to 
expand exports of services, manufactures and farm products. 
</P>
<P>
	Tonight I say we will work with the International Labor  
Organization on a new initiative to raise labor standards around 
the world. And this year, we will lead the international community 
to conclude a treaty to ban abusive child labor everywhere in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	If we do these things -- invest in our people, our communities,  
our technology, and lead in the global economy -- then we will begin 
to meet our historic responsibility to build a 21st Century 
prosperity for America. 
</P>
<P>
	You know, no nation in history has had the opportunity and the  
responsibility we now have: to shape a world that is more peaceful, 
more secure, more free. 
</P>
<P>
	All Americans can be proud that our leadership helped to bring  
peace in Northern Ireland. All Americans can be proud that our 
leadership has put Bosnia on the path to peace. And with our NATO 
allies, we are pressing the Serbian government to stop its brutal 
repression in Kosovo, to bring those -- thank you, thank you, to 
bring those responsible to justice and to give the people of Kosovo 
the self-government they deserve.

<HEADLINE> French Cycling Chief Admits Rrrors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Anti-drug investigations now being carried out by  
the French Cycling Federation point to possible errors in previous 
testing, the federation's president told a French newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have noted a number of anomalies,'' FFC president Daniel  
Baal said in an interview to be published Wednesday by France Soir. 
</P>
<P>
	Baal said that investigations have confirmed a widespread use of  
banned drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The controls show that we need to get down to work,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Professional cycling still is trying to recover from the scandal  
that rocked the 1998 Tour de France. Tour organizers threw out the 
Spanish Festina team after team officials admitted to the 
systematic use of banned drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The FFC wants to set up a scheme under which cyclists would be  
tested every three months. That system would allow the federation 
to detect unusual changes in cyclists' physical condition, Baal 
said.

<HEADLINE> Coe, Newspaperman, Dies at 82 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- Gordon H. Coe, whose long newspaper career  
ended when his son and wife were prosecuted in a notorious serial 
rape case, has died of complications from a stroke. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	Coe died Saturday in Edmonds, where he lived in a nursing home.  
</P>
<P>
	As managing editor of The Spokane Chronicle, Coe headed the  
paper's coverage of the so-called South Hill rapist. His son, Fred 
-- who later changed his name to Kevin -- was charged with some of 
the attacks in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	Coe, who oversaw a tips hotline on the rapes, turned over  
day-to-day coverage of the case to others and retired after his 
son's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Coe was convicted in 1981 on four rape counts and was  
sentenced to life in prison. After the convictions were overturned 
on appeal, he was convicted of three counts in a 1985 retrial. Two 
counts were later vacated and he was left with a 25-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon Coe's wife, the late Ruth Coe, was convicted in 1982 of  
trying to hire someone to kill the judge and prosecutor in her 
son's rape trial. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1993 interview with The Associated Press, Coe defended his  
wife and son, blaming their prosecutions on a conspiracy of Spokane 
County elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutions -- later subject of a true-crime book, ``Son,''  
by Jack Olsen that was made into a television movie -- had a 
profound effect on the family. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're aware of it every minute of every day,'' Coe said.  
``We're never going to live a normal life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coe was born in Spokane on Sept. 16, 1916, and became a reporter  
for The Spokane Chronicle in 1938. He served for 25 years as city 
editor and became managing editor in 1975. The Chronicle ceased 
publication in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Ravens Name Brian Billick As Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OWINGS MILLS, Md. (AP) -- Brian Billick was hired as coach of the  
Baltimore Ravens today, two days after his team was upset in the 
NFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	Billick, the offensive coordinator of the Minnesota Vikings, was  
to be introduced at an evening news conference, a Ravens 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Billick replaces Ted Marchibroda, who was fired last month after  
the Ravens completed a 6-10 season. 
</P>
<P>
	He came to Baltimore for an interview today after the Cleveland  
Browns crossed him off their list of prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	``This thing could happen at any time,'' Billick said Monday  
before leaving Minnesota. ``I think they have all the information 
they need. I certainly have all the information I need about the 
organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Billick was a candidate to become the expansion Browns' first  
head coach. But Cleveland eliminated him from contention Monday, 
with president Carmen Policy citing ``philosophical differences'' 
as the main reason behind the surprise announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Billick has been the Vikings' offensive coordinator the past  
five years. Under his direction, the Vikings scored an NFL-record 
556 points this regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	That's attractive to the Ravens, who need to bolster an attack  
to complement a defense that held opponents below 17 points in half 
the games. Minnesota beat Baltimore 38-28 this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Baltimore has some intriguing aspects,'' Billick said Monday.  
``I'm very impressed with Mr. Modell -- both Modells, Art and David 
-- in terms of their concept of where that organization is going. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Vice president of player personnel) Ozzie Newsome is one of  
the best personal people in the business. They've got talent, and I 
was excited by the city of Baltimore, the energy that was there 
when we (played) there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Billick became available after the Vikings were upset 30-27 in  
overtime by the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday. Had the Vikings won, the 
Ravens would not be able to interview Billick until after the Super 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Billick was hired, another prime candidate for the  
Ravens' job was Jacksonville Jaguars offensive coordinator Chris 
Palmer, 
</P>
<P>
	The Ravens also interviewed Pittsburgh Steelers defensive  
coordinator Jim Haslett. Emmitt Thomas was considered a candidate 
until he followed Ray Rhodes from Philadelphia to Green Bay as the 
defensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore originally wanted either George Seifert or Mike  
Holmgren, both having already established themselves as outstanding 
NFL coaches. But Seifert signed with Carolina, and Holmgren 
canceled a trip to Baltimore after accepting a job with the Seattle 
Seahawks.

<HEADLINE>  Finnish IOC Member Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The first IOC member resigned Tuesday in the  
growing Olympic bribery scandal -- not one of the committee's power 
brokers but a former sprint champion who said her only offense was 
being too naive. 
</P>
<P>
	Pirjo Haeggman of Finland, one of the first two women appointed  
to the International Olympic Committee, submitted her resignation 
in person to IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch in Lausanne, 
Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	Haeggman is one of 13 members implicated in the investigation  
into allegations of misconduct by IOC delegates stemming from Salt 
Lake's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games, the biggest 
corruption scandal in Olympic history. 
</P>
<P>
	While Haeggman was the first IOC member to resign since the  
scandal broke, three other Olympic officials have also quit. They 
are Salt Lake Organizing Committee President Frank Joklik and 
Senior Vice President Dave Johnson, and Alfredo La Mont, the U.S. 
Olympic Committee's senior director of international relations. 
</P>
<P>
	Haeggman is only the second IOC member to resign in a scandal.  
Robert Helmick stepped down in 1991 as an IOC member and president 
of the U.S. Olympic Committee amid allegations of conflict of 
interest in contracts with sports associations. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement from Helsinki, Haeggman denied any wrongdoing but  
said she could no longer function as an IOC member. She said she 
had been ``rash and perhaps naive in my trust in other people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haeggman's ex-husband, Bjarne, reportedly worked briefly for the  
Salt Lake bid committee and for 20 months in an Ontario government 
job initiated by the Toronto committee bidding for the 1996 Summer 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Haeggman was among the nine IOC members accused of serious  
violations who faced possible expulsion, a senior Olympic official 
close to the investigation told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Four other members have been cited for minor violations and face  
warnings or no sanctions at all, according to the official, who 
spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The 13 members all received letters from IOC investigators  
asking to explain actions by themselves or members of their 
families. Tuesday was the deadline for replies. 
</P>
<P>
	Anita DeFrantz, a vice president from the United States and the  
highest ranking woman in IOC history, said she was surprised by 
Haeggman's action but glad a fellow former athlete had made the 
sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who would've thought Pirjo would resign?'' said DeFrantz, a  
bronze medal rower in 1976. ``I guess it renews my belief in 
Olympians, that when she was called to task, she said `All right, I 
have been judged guilty and I will resign.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Haeggman resigned four days before the IOC investigators, headed  
by vice president Dick Pound, are to meet in Lausanne to conclude 
their inquiry and make recommendations to the executive board. 
</P>
<P>
	The board can suspend any members found guilty of serious  
misconduct. A special general assembly has been called for March 
17-18 to vote on expulsions. 
</P>
<P>
	The senior IOC official said the committee hoped other members  
facing expulsion would resign to avoid embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
	The official said the eight other members accused of serious  
offenses were Agustin Arroyo (Ecuador), Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi 
(Libya), Zein El Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gadir (Sudan), Jean-Claude Ganga 
(Republic of Congo), Lamine Keita (Mali), Charles Mukora (Kenya), 
Sergio Santander (Chile) and David Sibandze (Swaziland). 
</P>
<P>
	Those cited for minor infractions were Kim Un-Yong, an executive  
board member from South Korea; Vitaly Smirnov, former vice 
president from Russia; Dutch member Anton Geesink; and protocol 
chief Louis Guirandou-N'Diaye of Ivory Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Haeggman, 47, was an IOC member since 1981, appointed at the  
same session along with Flor Isava-Fonseca of Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
	A 400-meter runner in the 1972, '76 and '80 Olympics, Haeggman  
was 12-time Finnish champion at 100 and 400 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC president thanks Mrs. Haeggman for all the services  
which she gave to the Olympic movement as an athlete and as a 
member of the organization,'' an IOC statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Henderson, who was head of the 1996 Toronto bid, said his  
organization paid the $650-a-month rent in Sault Ste. Marie, 
Ontario, for Haeggman and her ex-husband. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson said the money was to be repaid to the Toronto  
committee and was neither a gift nor an attempt to win the IOC 
member's vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch knew of and approved the payments, according to  
Henderson, who said he did not know if the bid committee was 
reimbursed. 
</P>
<P>
	Haeggman said she never knew the Toronto committee paid the rent  
or that her ex-husband received fees from Salt Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	``My impression up to this day has been that the rent for our  
dwelling was paid according to the contract by my husband's 
employer,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC investigation is one of four into allegations that  
members or their relatives received cash payments, scholarships, 
jobs, free medical treatment, help with real estate deal and other 
enticements from Salt Lake boosters. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the scandal broke last month, allegations have surfaced of  
vote-buying by other cities during other Olympic selections. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC leaders reiterated Tuesday they would expand the Salt Lake  
inquiry to other cities if there is hard evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the very beginning, we received a mandate to investigate  
every possible form of corruption, not limited to Salt Lake City,'' 
IOC executive board member Jacques Rogge said. ``But to bring 
charges against someone, you need documented evidence. As of today, 
I have not seen documented evidence from other cities. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``If documented evidence shows up, if we find it, it is sure the  
IOC will bring charges against those people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The federal grand jury in Salt Lake City is scheduled to start  
hearing testimony Wednesday in an investigation thought to focus on 
tax and bribery charges. Among those subpoenaed to testify was 
Stephanie Pate, secretary to former Salt Lake bid and organizing 
committee chief Tom Welch. 
</P>
<P>
	-- At least two IOC members from Africa accepted prostitutes  
offered by Amsterdam's bid committee for the 1992 Olympics, a 
member of an Olympic promotional group said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was there and saw it, IOC members being offered women and  
two accepting,'' Prince Frederic von Saxe-Lauenberg, a member of 
the Pierre de Coubertin International Committee, told The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to identify the two African members and said six  
other members on an inspection visit to Amsterdam in 1986 declined 
the offer. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Nagano Gov. Goro Yoshimura, who chaired the committee that won  
the 1998 Winter Olympics, said a sword reportedly worth about 
$13,000 was presented to Samaranch in person. But the IOC said the 
sword was not found in the ``Samaranch Collection,'' which consists 
of art, Olympic torches and other gifts the president has received 
through the years.

<HEADLINE> White House To Open Clinton Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- White House lawyers are mounting an aggressive  
defense of President Clinton only hours before he delivers a State 
of the Union address from the very chamber where he was impeached 
for ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said today that some  
Democratic members of the House Judiciary Committee will join 
Clinton's defense team, along with former Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark. 
He declined to name the House Democrats or say how many are 
involved, but said they were joining the team at the White House 
request. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart told reporters that Bumpers and the others were added  
because they ``can offer some valuable insight into how we got to 
this point.'' They will make presentations during Clinton's 
defense, Lockhart said, and will be able to explain how ``it moved 
forward in a very partisan way, and in a way that was not fair to 
the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In opening arguments before the Senate, Clinton's defense team  
was focusing on conflicts in testimony gathered by Independent 
Counsel Kenneth Starr, a shift in strategy aimed at undercutting 
House charges of perjury and obstruction of justice, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Clinton's lawyers have expressed interest in having  
some Democrats from the House Judiciary Committee join the defense 
team, according to officials familiar with the White House 
discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	This will be the second year that Clinton's State of the Union  
address has been clouded by charges of marital infidelities. He 
presented his 1998 speech a few days after the Monica Lewinsky 
story was made public. 
</P>
<P>
	At his trial, meanwhile, the switch from not discussing the  
facts to disputing many of them could bolster Republican demands 
for witnesses to help resolve the disputes. The White House has 
been fighting that prospect but now expects witnesses, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, John Podesta, the White House chief of staff, said  
today there is no assurance that witnesses could resolve whatever 
conflicts might exist in testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think after our defense team has put down the case on the  
facts, the law and the Constitution, have reminded the senators 
there are 60,000 pages of testimony from over 100 witnesses that 
are before them already, they may find there is no need for 
witnesses,'' Podesta said on NBC's ``Today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Clinton's lawyers conclude their arguments, he said, they  
will move to dismiss the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle said Monday that witnesses  
might be inevitable. In an interview with The Associated Press, the 
South Dakota Democrat said witnesses could lead to the spectacle of 
100 senators watching former Ms. Lewinsky, the former White House 
intern, ``point to where the president touched her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., dismissed Daschle's warning as  
``all-or-nothing'' scare tactics that are ``just not true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House GOP prosecutors on Saturday finished a three-day  
presentation of their case in support of two articles of 
impeachment that were approved Dec. 19 on mostly partisan votes. 
The White House will get 24 hours to present its rebuttal. White 
House Counsel Charles F.C. Ruff was to spend several hours 
presenting opening defense arguments today before the trial 
recesses for Clinton's State of the Union address in the House 
chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	After the White House finishes its presentation, the Senate will  
submit questions in writing to both sides, to be read by Chief 
Justice William Rehnquist as presiding trial officer. 
</P>
<P>
	One area of White House attack is witness testimony in regard to  
the alleged obstruction of justice. Ms. Lewinsky says she got a 
call from Clinton's secretary, Betty Currie, arranging to pick up 
gifts from the president a few hours after Ms. Lewinsky told 
Clinton of her concern that she'd have to turn over the presents to 
lawyers in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit against the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mrs. Currie says she thinks it was Ms. Lewinsky who  
initiated the gift return and Mrs. Currie has testified that she 
has no recollection of ever talking to Clinton about returning the 
gifts, before or after she picked them up. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton legal team credits Mrs. Currie's account, while  
noting that both witnesses testified that the president did not ask 
Ms. Lewinsky to surrender the gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	Such back-and-forth forms the backdrop for Clinton's address  
tonight, when bitter political enemies crowd onto the House floor 
as the president, his legacy already soiled by impeachment, lays 
out his agenda for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders have advised their rank and file to give him a  
courteous, but restrained, reception. Senate Republican aides who 
asked not to be identified said GOP leaders were quietly spreading 
the word that senators should adopt the demeanor of Supreme Court 
justices who will attend and not express themselves during the 
address. 
</P>
<P>
	Absent will be House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde,  
who said he prefers to avoid crowds. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey released Monday by the Pew Research Center for the  
People &AMP; the Press showed that a steady two-thirds of Americans 
want it the trial to end with Clinton still in office, and that 
less than one-third are paying close attention to the historic 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty-nine percent said the trial had not changed their opinions  
about whether the president should be removed from office or 
resign.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Case for Two More Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Appealing past his impeachment accusers and  
jurors, President Clinton made his case for the future to Americans 
who like the job he's doing. On trial for that job, Clinton said 
that he has strengthened the state of the union and can make it 
stronger still in the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``America is working again,'' Clinton said Tuesday night in a  
State of the Union address boasting of prosperity, warning against 
complacency and promising to set about the work of the 21st 
century. 
</P>
<P>
	To keep his hand in that work, he will have to win acquittal in  
his Senate impeachment trial, but that he could not ask of the 
accusing Congress in joint session, with the Cabinet, Supreme Court 
justices, diplomats and soldiers, the government of the United 
States assembled for the president's hour-plus at center stage. 
</P>
<P>
	It is an occasion of state and ritual, annual but extraordinary  
this time for the state of a president impeached and on Senate 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton did not speak of that. He did say he hoped that a  
century hence another president could look back and say ``that we 
put aside our divisions and found a new hour of healing and 
hopefulness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He offered a catalog of proposals, some tuned to the political  
center, some to Democratic domestic priorities. It was, Clinton 
noted, the last State of the Union report of the 20th century, and 
he used it to show himself as a president at work, tending to 
business and looking for more. 
</P>
<P>
	He wants 60 percent of an expected $4 trillion budget surplus  
over the next 15 years put into Social Security as a first step 
toward keeping the system solvent. That's coupled with a proposal 
to put some of the money into the stock market and to create new 
retirement accounts for individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	He seeks new education aid, tested for results by Washington;  
increased defense spending over the next decade, tax cuts tailored 
to help cover the cost of long-term health care, for the disabled, 
for child care. He recommends, again, a patients' bill of rights in 
managed care. He's got a crime bill to help hire 50,000 new police 
officers. He wants the minimum wage increased. 
</P>
<P>
	While it is not a menu to Republican taste, it does include some  
proposals that could be a beginning toward compromise, the only way 
things can be done in a divided government anyhow. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House billed it as Clinton's most ambitious agenda  
since his first State of the Union address, in 1993. And it meshes 
with his dual strategy for winning impeachment acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a legal defense plus a political offensive, displayed in  
an extraordinary cross-Capitol drama. 
</P>
<P>
	First, Clinton's lawyer argued in the Senate that he is not  
guilty and not impeachable on the perjury and obstruction of 
justice charges voted by the Republican House over the Monica 
Lewinsky affair. ``He must not be removed from office,'' Charles 
Ruff, the White House counsel, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, it was Clinton's turn, in the House chamber, where he was  
impeached just one month ago. The timing drew an undertone of 
criticism and led some Republicans to stay away. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the Monica Lewinsky investigation began, a year ago, while  
he was dishonestly denying it, Clinton has been saying that he 
would do the people's business, putting his scandal troubles in a 
mental box so that they wouldn't intrude on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	The polls indicate the effectiveness of that course. The latest  
round suggests that well over 60 percent of Americans approve of 
his performance in office. They say overwhelmingly that Clinton is 
not honest and trustworthy, and just as overwhelmingly that they 
are satisfied with the way things are going for the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	For all the Republicans' insistence that impeachment should not  
be affected by the polls, assembling a two-thirds Senate vote to 
convict and unseat a president with those ratings would defy 
political gravity. 
</P>
<P>
	The same surveys show that most people think the Senate trial  
should end, and that about two-thirds want Clinton to remain in 
office to serve out the term that will end two years from 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In another sign that his stick-to-business argument is working,  
Republicans made a point of beginning State of the Union day by 
presenting their own agenda, including a 10 percent income tax cut 
Clinton's program would block. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people's business is going forward in the United States  
Senate,'' said Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader. 
</P>
<P>
	And while Clinton didn't speak of impeachment, Republicans did.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our country is not in crisis,'' Rep. Jennifer Dunn of  
Washington said in the GOP response to Clinton's address. ``No 
matter what the outcome of the president's situation, life in 
America will go on.''

<P>
	Haeggman was among the nine IOC members accused of serious  
violations who faced possible expulsion, a senior Olympic official 
close to the investigation told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Four other members have been cited for minor violations and face  
warnings or no sanctions at all, according to the official, who 
spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The 13 members all received letters from IOC investigators  
asking to explain actions by themselves or members of their 
families. Tuesday was the deadline for replies. 
</P>
<P>
	Anita DeFrantz, a vice president from the United States and the  
highest ranking woman in IOC history, said she was surprised by 
Haeggman's action but glad a fellow former athlete had made the 
sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who would've thought Pirjo would resign?'' said DeFrantz, a  
bronze medal rower in 1976. ``I guess it renews my belief in 
Olympians, that when she was called to task, she said `All right, I 
have been judged guilty and I will resign.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Haeggman resigned four days before the IOC investigators, headed  
by vice president Dick Pound, are to meet in Lausanne to conclude 
their inquiry and make recommendations to the executive board. 
</P>
<P>
	The board can suspend any members found guilty of serious  
misconduct. A special general assembly has been called for March 
17-18 to vote on expulsions. 
</P>
<P>
	The senior IOC official said the committee hoped other members  
facing expulsion would resign to avoid embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
	The official said the eight other members accused of serious  
offenses were Agustin Arroyo (Ecuador), Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi 
(Libya), Zein El Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gadir (Sudan), Jean-Claude Ganga 
(Republic of Congo), Lamine Keita (Mali), Charles Mukora (Kenya), 
Sergio Santander (Chile) and David Sibandze (Swaziland). 
</P>
<P>
	Those cited for minor infractions were Kim Un-Yong, an executive  
board member from South Korea; Vitaly Smirnov, former vice 
president from Russia; Dutch member Anton Geesink; and protocol 
chief Louis Guirandou-N'Diaye of Ivory Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Haeggman, 47, was an IOC member since 1981, appointed at the  
same session along with Flor Isava-Fonseca of Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
	A 400-meter runner in the 1972, '76 and '80 Olympics, Haeggman  
was 12-time Finnish champion at 100 and 400 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC president thanks Mrs. Haeggman for all the services  
which she gave to the Olympic movement as an athlete and as a 
member of the organization,'' an IOC statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Henderson, who was head of the 1996 Toronto bid, said his  
organization paid the $650-a-month rent in Sault Ste. Marie, 
Ontario, for Haeggman and her ex-husband. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson said the money was to be repaid to the Toronto  
committee and was neither a gift nor an attempt to win the IOC 
member's vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch knew of and approved the payments, according to  
Henderson, who said he did not know if the bid committee was 
reimbursed. 
</P>
<P>
	Haeggman said she never knew the Toronto committee paid the rent  
or that her ex-husband received fees from Salt Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	``My impression up to this day has been that the rent for our  
dwelling was paid according to the contract by my husband's 
employer,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC investigation is one of four into allegations that  
members or their relatives received cash payments, scholarships, 
jobs, free medical treatment, help with real estate deal and other 
enticements from Salt Lake boosters. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the scandal broke last month, allegations have surfaced of  
vote-buying by other cities during other Olympic selections. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC leaders reiterated Tuesday they would expand the Salt Lake  
inquiry to other cities if there is hard evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the very beginning, we received a mandate to investigate  
every possible form of corruption, not limited to Salt Lake City,'' 
IOC executive board member Jacques Rogge said. ``But to bring 
charges against someone, you need documented evidence. As of today, 
I have not seen documented evidence from other cities. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``If documented evidence shows up, if we find it, it is sure the  
IOC will bring charges against those people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The federal grand jury in Salt Lake City is scheduled to start  
hearing testimony Wednesday in an investigation thought to focus on 
tax and bribery charges. Among those subpoenaed to testify was 
Stephanie Pate, secretary to former Salt Lake bid and organizing 
committee chief Tom Welch. 
</P>
<P>
	-- At least two IOC members from Africa accepted prostitutes  
offered by Amsterdam's bid committee for the 1992 Olympics, a 
member of an Olympic promotional group said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was there and saw it, IOC members being offered women and  
two accepting,'' Prince Frederic von Saxe-Lauenberg, a member of 
the Pierre de Coubertin International Committee, told The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to identify the two African members and said six  
other members on an inspection visit to Amsterdam in 1986 declined 
the offer. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Nagano Gov. Goro Yoshimura, who chaired the committee that won  
the 1998 Winter Olympics, said a sword reportedly worth about 
$13,000 was presented to Samaranch in person. But the IOC said the 
sword was not found in the ``Samaranch Collection,'' which consists 
of art, Olympic torches and other gifts the president has received 
through the years.

<HEADLINE> Couple Disoriented on Wintry Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PAINESVILLE, Ohio (AP) -- Tom Benner remembers the fear of the  
86-year-old woman who showed up at his tavern in the bitter cold, 
wondering where she and her husband could find a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``She told me she and her husband had already been driving for  
more than six hours,'' Benner said Tuesday. ``I told her to wait 
while I call for some help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few minutes later, he found Betty Schneider outside, walking  
in the parking lot of the Gallop Inn, looking for her 90-year-old 
husband, Nicholas. 
</P>
<P>
	He was later found in his car Friday night, killed by a fire  
that began after the car crashed into a snow pile that may have 
blocked the doors. The fire began in a front-seat floor area that 
has electrical wiring for the door, air bag and heater of the 1999 
four-wheel drive Subaru. 
</P>
<P>
	Painesville Fire Capt. Ken Takacs said there was no evidence of  
foul play. ``He was an elderly gentleman who got disoriented,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Schneiders apparently headed out Friday to go to a doctor's  
appointment, but got lost and wound up miles from home. The weather 
was well below freezing and roadways were still icy from a winter 
storm. 
</P>
<P>
	The Schneiders, who live in the Cleveland suburb of Parma,  
eventually pulled into the Gallop Inn about 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Schneider, alone and frightened, walked into the tavern  
about 10 miles from Parma and found Benner. 
</P>
<P>
	``She said to me, ``My husband's gone!''' Benner said. ``That  
was the closest she came to crying. You could tell she was 
devastated.''

<HEADLINE> NIH: Put Babies in Bed on Backs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Parents are being reminded to place babies on  
their back when they are put to bed to reduce the chance of sudden 
infant death syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development  
issued the reminder Tuesday, noting that traditionally there has 
been a higher incidence of sudden infant death in cold weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 3,000 babies each year fall victim to sudden, unexplained  
death in the first year of life. The causes of SIDS are unclear, 
and it is not currently possible to predict which infants may be 
affected. 
</P>
<P>
	But researchers said that since they launched the campaign to  
get parents to place babies on their backs there has been a 43 
percent reduction in sudden infant deaths.

<P>
	Lake effect snow showers were falling over parts of the Great  
Lakes this morning while heavy rain was reported in central 
California. Later today, precipitation is expected to continue 
along the Pacific coast while mainly dry weather was predicted 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Variably cloudy skies and dry weather were predicted from  
northern New England through the mid-Atlantic States. But a weak 
frontal boundary may approach areas of the eastern Great Lakes and 
northern New England later today, causing cloudy skies and a chance 
for a few snow showers by nightfall. Partly cloudy skies and dry 
weather are predicted over the Southeast and lower Mississippi 
Valley today. 
</P>
<P>
	Dry weather is also forecast over most parts of the central  
United States. However, a weak low pressure may bring a chance for 
some very light rain or sprinkles to areas along the Ohio River. 
Further north, a few lake effect snow showers may occur in parts of 
Michigan. Otherwise, skies across the region were expected to range 
from mostly cloudy over the northern tier of states, to mostly 
sunny in the southern Plains. 
</P>
<P>
	A storm system is expected to continue to affect many areas in  
the West. Rain and higher elevation-snow may occur over most of the 
West Coast, east into the Rocky Mountain States. The heaviest 
precipitation is forecast in the Pacific Northwest, with moderate 
to heavy rain possible over western areas of Washington and Oregon. 
Localized flash flooding could also occur. 
</P>
<P>
	Windy conditions may also be a problem in the Northwest, with  
some wind gusts over 60 mph. Further south, rain is likely over 
most of California, with snow in the Sierra-Nevada Range. Areas 
above 5,000 feet may receive more than 10 inches of snow before 
nightfall. 
</P>
<P>
	Highs in the 30s and 40s were forecast for most of New England,  
the Midwest, the central Plains and most of the Pacific Northwest; 
in the 40s and 50s in most of the Pacific Southwest, parts of the 
middle Plains and the mid-Atlantic states; in the 60s and 70s in 
the Southeast, the Southern Plains, southern California and central 
Texas; and in the 80s in southern Texas and Florida.

<HEADLINE>  Atlanta Revels in Falcons 1st Bowl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- No one expected the Atlanta Falcons to be in the  
Super Bowl. Even the NFL was caught off guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Dan Reeves was grinning with satisfaction Monday as he  
discussed his dealings with the league after the Falcons shocked 
the heavily favored Minnesota Vikings in the NFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, following Atlanta's 30-27 overtime victory, Reeves  
met with two NFL officials about the schedule of events at the Jan. 
31 Super Bowl in Miami. He couldn't help but notice the itinerary 
was sprinkled with references to the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, on Monday, the NFL faxed Reeves a memo that included  
another faux pas. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could tell they weren't expecting us because it said,  
`Atlanta Falcons, head coach Denny Green,''' Reeves said, grinning 
with satisfaction. ``They had changed the team from Minnesota 
Vikings, but they forgot to change the head coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Well, get used to the idea of Atlanta playing in the Super Bowl,  
as strange as that may seem for a franchise that's had only eight 
winning seasons in 33 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Denver is an early seven-point favorite in  
the Super Bowl, which doesn't bother the Falcons a bit. They have 
reveled in the role of underdog all season, beating a Minnesota 
team that was a double-figure favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole country had them beating us by 11 points, had them  
on top of the world,'' tight end O.J. Santiago said. ``Every time I 
looked at the TV, it seemed like Minnesota was on there. There's 
nothing wrong with that. They broke a lot of records. 
</P>
<P>
	``But at 14-2 (Atlanta's record during the regular season), you  
think somebody would notice we've got a good team. Now, maybe they 
will notice us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oh, they're noticing -- especially in Atlanta, where the city  
awoke Monday with a giant ``Dirty Bird'' hangover. 
</P>
<P>
	The party spilled into the streets as soon as Andersen's kick  
sailed through the uprights, then moved to Hartsfield Atlanta 
International Airport, where the team was greeted by more than 
5,000 people late Sunday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	``You felt like you were in a dream world,'' said linebacker  
Jessie Tuggle, who has been with the Falcons for a dozen, mostly 
losing seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 4,000 or so revelers jammed the team's suburban training  
complex, creating a rush hour-like traffic jam in the middle of the 
night. The scene was surreal when the players, after taking buses 
from the airport, appeared on a second-floor balcony, saluting the 
crowd that had taken over the practice field below. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was absolutely nuts,'' Tuggle said. ``It was like a rock  
concert in Suwanee, Ga.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Dan Reeves, who underwent heart bypass surgery just five  
weeks ago, endured a whirlwind schedule Monday. After getting only 
4 1/2 hours of sleep, he appeared on ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' 
stopped by Piedmont Hospital for a routine checkup, and held his 
usual postgame news conference in Suwanee. The team will begin 
practicing for the Broncos on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the Super Bowl focus will be on Reeves, who will be  
facing the team he coached for 12 years and took to three title 
games. He'll also be facing the coach he fired for alleged 
subordination and the quarterback who said playing for Reeves was 
``hell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves, fired by the Broncos after the 1992 season, insisted  
Monday that he has buried any hard feelings for Mike Shanahan and 
John Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't live in the past,'' the Falcons coach said. ``If  
you're going to be a football coach and you preach and teach to the 
players that they should look to the next play and not think about 
the last one, I think you have to go through life the same way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves said there was a reconciliation of sorts last summer,  
when by chance all three wound up playing golf on the same day at 
Augusta National. The Atlanta coach congratulated Shanahan and 
Elway on their Super Bowl victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's done in the past is done,'' Reeves said. ``I can look  
myself in the mirror and say I did what was best for my football 
team at the time. You have to make some tough decisions. I can't 
change them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, there are new debts to pay.  
</P>
<P>
	Reeves, who turns 55 today, promised to perform the ``Dirty  
Bird'' dance in downtown Atlanta if the Falcons made the Super 
Bowl. He claims he did just that in the pre-dawn hours Monday, 
stopping his car along Peachtree Street and flapping his arms. 
</P>
<P>
	There's only one problem: he had no witnesses.  
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't say how long and I didn't say when, so I did it this  
morning,'' Reeves said with a smile. ``It was 6:45, and there was 
nobody on the road. That's why I did it, and I did it goooood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Falcons receiver Terance Mathis, who caught the touchdown pass  
that sent the game to overtime, wasn't buying Reeves' version of 
events. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a copout, man,'' Mathis said with a laugh. ``He could  
have at least called the media and alerted them. That doesn't 
count. We're going to make him do it.''

<HEADLINE> Auburn-Kentucky Will Be a Showdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- In most years, Kentucky would have every  
reason to be confident going into Wednesday night's game against 
Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, though, the sixth-ranked Tigers are off to a 17-0  
start, while the No. 7 Wildcats look vulnerable, having lost three 
of their last eight games. 
</P>
<P>
	Led by junior college transfer Chris Porter, who is averaging  
16.8 points and 8.7 rebounds, Auburn has breezed, winning all but 
one of its games by double-digit margins. 
</P>
<P>
	The defending national champions, on the other hand, have  
struggled in recent weeks, losing consecutive games to Duke and 
Louisville in December, then losing at home last week to Tennessee 
and struggling to beat Mississippi 63-57 on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky coach Tubby Smith sounded envious Tuesday as he talked  
about the Tigers, who are among the nation's statistical leaders in 
scoring offense and defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're very athletic. They're playing so well together as a  
team,'' Smith said. ``When you're playing with that confidence, 
it's tough to beat anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn has benefited from the stability of having had Porter,  
Bryant Smith, Mamadou N'diaye, Scott Pohlman and Doc Robinson start 
every game. The Wildcats, on the other hand, have routinely juggled 
lineups as Smith has searched for the right combination. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have that consistency yet,'' Smith said.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite not having won at Rupp Arena since 1988, Auburn coach  
Cliff Ellis did not expect his team to be intimidated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they're as prepared as they possibly can be,'' Ellis  
said. ``Kentucky's a great team, but I think we're a good team, 
too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn (5-0 Southeastern Conference) may have snuck up on some  
early opponents, but the 17-0 record means the Tigers are no longer 
a surprise, said Ellis, who will be coaching his 700th Division I 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every game is going to be a war,'' he said. ``In this position  
you're going to get everybody's best shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky (15-4, 4-1 SEC) may play without center Jamaal  
Magloire, who Smith said will be suspended for patting the 
underside of a Mississippi player's chin during Saturday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Magloire received a tehcnical foul and was benched by Smith for  
the last 16 minutes of the Mississippi game, but said afterward 
that he thought the incident had fired up his teammates. Smith 
disagreed and said Tuesday that Magloire would be punished further, 
though he refused to give details or say whether Magloire would 
miss the Auburn game.

	Ruff Presents Clinton's Side  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- White House Counsel Charles Ruff opened  
President Clinton's impeachment defense today with statements of 
Clinton's innocence and an attack on the House's ``rush to 
judgment.'' Ruff offered Senators a point-by-point rebuttal on each 
allegation of perjury and obstruction of justice. He also accused 
the House of ``prosecutorial ... fudge'' on one key piece of 
evidence, saying the House was wrong about its claim that Clinton 
had ordered his secretary to retrieve gifts the president had given 
Monica Lewinsky. Similarly, Ruff said the House was mistaken about 
a key fact in connection with Clinton's efforts to find Lewinsky a 
job. The White House is expected to continue its presentation 
tomorrow and Thursday.

	Social Security Plan To Be Offered  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will announce his  
long-awaited proposal to shore up Social Security during his State 
of the Union address tonight. His plan would use budget surpluses 
to ensure the retirement system can pay promised benefits. It also 
would create separate 401(k)-style accounts for most working 
Americans, marking the first time the government could invest some 
of Social Security's cash reserves in the stock market. Republicans 
also have made reforming the nation's retirement system a priority 
this year, with party leaders even offering to introduce 
legislation Clinton recommends.

	NATO on Alert for Kosovo Strikes  
</P>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- NATO planes and missiles remain on  
alert for strikes against Yugoslavia, ready to spring into action 
after an order from political authorities. Last fall, Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic halted his offensive against ethnic 
Albanians in Kosovo only under the threat of attacks. Gens. Wesley 
Clark, the American who serves as NATO's supreme allied commander 
in Europe, and Klaus Naumann, the German who chairs the NATO 
Military Committee, went to Belgrade today to warn Milosevic that 
if he didn't end his latest offensive in Kosovo the consequences 
could be severe. NATO's Council meets tomorrow to discuss the next 
step.

	Court Denies 'Three-Strikes' Appeal  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a pair of crime-related decisions, the  
Supreme Court today left intact California's three-strikes law for 
repeat offenders and allowed Florida to continue using the electric 
chair as the sole means of the state's death penalty. The justices 
rejected the appeal of a man sentenced to 25 years to life in 
prison after he stole a bottle of vitamins from a supermarket, his 
ninth conviction. They also rejected a condemned man's contention 
that electrocution is a cruel and outmoded method of capital 
punishment.

	New Weight-Loss Drug Called Safe  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- An experimental diet drug that scientists hope is  
safer than the ill-fated Redux and fen-phen helped obese people 
shed pounds and keep them off in a two-year study, researchers say. 
Orlistat, trade-named Xenical, has been judged safe and effective 
by an advisory panel to the FDA. Orlistat blocks absorption of 
about one-third of fat that people consume, explains the study's 
author. The drug's manufacturer, Hoffman LaRoche Inc., expects a 
final decision from the FDA soon.

	Microsoft Beats Earnings Estimates

<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Strong growth in personal computer shipments  
during the second-quarter boosted demand for Microsoft's software, 
increasing the company's revenues by 38 percent from a year ago. 
Microsoft's revenues for the quarter were $4.94 billion. It had net 
income of $1.98 billion and diluted earnings per share of 73 cents 
for the quarter ended Dec. 31.

all day. The Dow industrials rose 14.67 to 9,355.22. On the NYSE, 
advancers edged decliners 1,530-1,522. The Nasdaq rose 59.47 to

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dennis Rodman, the controversial seven-time NBA  
rebounding leader, has decided to retire from professional 
basketball, his agent said today. ``He doesn't want to play,'' 
agent Dwight Manley said. ``He wants to go into the sports and 
entertainment field.'' Rodman won three championships with the 
Chicago Bulls in 1996, 1997 and 1998, and two titles with the 
Detroit Pistons in 1989 and 1990.

member to resign in the growing Olympic bribery scandal. Haeggman 
submitted her resignation to IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch 
in Lausanne, Switzerland. She is one of 13 members implicated in 
the investigation into allegations of misconduct by IOC delegates 
stemming from Salt Lake's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games.

<HEADLINE> Conn. Prof Wins Discrimination Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A jury has awarded more than $12.6  
million to a former chemistry professor who had filed a sex 
discrimination lawsuit after being denied tenure at Hartford's 
Trinity College. 
</P>
<P>
	The award may be the largest ever in a U.S. tenure case,  
education experts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Leslie Craine, 55, was hired in 1987. She was given the  
unanimous recommendation of her department but was denied tenure in 
1993. She sued and lost her job the following year. 
</P>
<P>
	The case went to trial in November in Hartford Superior Court.  
The jury issued its verdict Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors rejected her claim of age discrimination but agreed with  
her on claims of sex discrimination and breach of contract. The 
award included $671,304 for loss of past and future wages, $2 
million for sex discrimination, $4 million for emotional distress 
and $6 million in punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	``We asked the jury to send a message that it is not appropriate  
to treat women differently than men,'' said Jacques J. Parenteau, a 
lawyer for Craine. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for the school, Felix J. Springer, said women make up  
about half of Trinity's faculty and one-third of its tenured 
faculty, ``a record I suspect is among the best in New England.'' 
The school plans to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan Kurland, associate general secretary of the American  
Association of University Professors in Washington, said courts 
traditionally have deferred to schools on tenure decisions. He said 
the jury award may be the largest of its kind. 
</P>
<P>
	Craine now teaches part time at Central Connecticut State  
University in New Britain.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Lays Out Ambitious Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Before a Congress torn over impeachment,  
President Clinton offered a bold plan Tuesday to protect Social 
Security with the huge budget surpluses that Republicans are eyeing 
for tax cuts. ``First things first,'' Clinton insisted. 
</P>
<P>
	On a day of high drama that shifted from his trial in the Senate  
to his State of the Union address, Clinton also urged spending 
billions of dollars for new programs in child care, education, 
crime-fighting, the environment and the Pentagon. And he called for 
raising the minimum wage by $1 an hour over two years to $6.15. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said that ``with our budget surplus growing, our  
economy expanding, our confidence rising, now is the time for this 
generation to meet our historic responsibility to the 21st century. 
Let's get to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In response to Clinton's speech, Republicans said the nation's  
business would not be hurt regardless of the outcome of Clinton's 
impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our country is not in crisis. There are no tanks in the  
streets,'' Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., said in prepared remarks. 
``No matter what the outcome of the president's situation, life in 
America will go on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two special guests were invited to sit in the House chamber with  
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton as the president spoke: civil 
rights pioneer Rosa Parks and baseball slugger Sammy Sosa. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's speech came eight hours after White House lawyers  
began defending the president in a Senate trial, arguing he was 
innocent of perjury and obstruction of justice charges and ``must 
not be removed from office.'' The president was to speak from the 
same House chamber where lawmakers voted exactly one month ago 
along party lines to impeach him -- only the second time in history 
that has happened. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's advance text made no mention of his impeachment or the  
Senate trial that ended for the day just hours before. His closest 
reference was a mention of the ``clash of controversy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On education, the president said he would send Congress a plan  
that for the first time holds states and school districts 
accountable for their progress and rewards them for results, he 
said. Schools that fail to comply could lose some of the $15 
billion the federal government spends on education. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe we must change the way we invest that money, to  
support what works and to stop supporting what doesn't,'' the 
president said. No child should graduate from high school ``with a 
diploma he or she can't read,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	In his remarks on foreign policy, Clinton said the United States  
will continue to contain Iraq's Saddam Hussein. ``And we will work 
for the day when Iraq has a government worthy of its people,'' 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the aftermath of the killing of more than 40 ethnic Albanians  
in Kosovo, Clinton said the United States and NATO allies ``are 
pressing the Serbian government to stop its brutal repression in 
Kosovo, to bring those responsible to justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also proposed $4.2 billion -- a 70 percent increase -- to  
dismantle and destroy Russia's nuclear arsenal and redirect the 
work of Russian scientists from weapons to civilian research. 
</P>
<P>
	On Social Security, Clinton's proposal sets up a monumental  
fight over how to protect the giant retirement program and deal 
with GOP tax-cutting ambitions against a background of $4 trillion 
in projected surpluses over 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's proposal would create new 401(k)-style  
retirement accounts for workers and invest some of Social 
Security's cash reserves in the stock market for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	In sharp contrast, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott called for  
a 10 percent across-the-board tax cut. Republicans also attacked 
the idea of having the government invest Social Security cash on 
Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, no, a thousand times no,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas,  
House Ways and Means chairman. ``If you thought a government 
takeover of health care was bad, just wait until the government 
becomes an owner of America's private sector companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moving from last year's call to ``save Social Security first,''  
Clinton proposed transferring about 60 percent of expected budget 
surpluses over the next 15 years -- $2.7 trillion -- to the Social 
Security account to keep the program solvent until 2055. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-five percent of that money would be invested by the  
government in the stock market in hopes of achieving higher 
returns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I reach out my hand to those of you of both parties in both  
houses and ask you to join me in saying we will save Social 
Security now,'' Clinton said. ``Last year, we wisely reserved all 
of the surplus until we knew what it would take to save Social 
Security. Again, I say, we should not spend any of it until after 
Social Security is truly saved. 
</P>
<P>
	``First things first.''  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's plan also would reserve 15 percent of the surplus --  
$650 billion over 15 years -- for the ailing Medicare system. An 
additional 11 percent of the surplus -- $500 billion -- would be 
devoted to new government-subsidized retirement accounts, with the 
Treasury matching the savings of lower-income people. The rest of 
the surplus would go for military spending and domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Never before has a president delivered a State of the Union  
address under such extraordinary conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's House accusers and Senate judges were the immediate  
audience, although his real target was the millions of Americans 
watching at home. His job was to convince them he is faithful to 
their interests and should remain in power. 
</P>
<P>
	Given the extreme partisan divisions, House Speaker Dennis  
Hastert, R-Ill., admonished lawmakers to be on good behavior and to 
listen to the president's address ``soberly and with the dignity 
that befits the United States Congress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's major proposals include:  
</P>
<P>
	--$1 billion in tax credits for businesses to encourage  
investment in impoverished urban and rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
	--A tax credit of up to $250 per child age 1 or younger for  
parents who stay home to care for them. 
</P>
<P>
	--A $1,000 tax credit for Americans with long-term health-care  
needs and family members who care for them. 
</P>
<P>
	--$12 billion to improve military readiness and modernization in  
fiscal 2000 -- growing to $110 billion over six years.

<HEADLINE>  Philippine Court Orders Execution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- The lawyers of a convicted child  
rapist refused to concede defeat today after the Supreme Court gave 
the go-ahead for him to become the first person executed in the 
Philippines in 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The court withdrew its earlier order delaying the execution of  
Leo Echegaray, a poor house painter convicted of repeatedly raping 
his 10-year-old stepdaughter, and instructed a lower court to set a 
date for his death. 
</P>
<P>
	Echegaray, 38, was about to be executed Jan. 4 when the Supreme  
Court ordered a six-month delay to allow Congress time to review a 
law that restored capital punishment in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a marathon 10-hour session that ended early today, the  
House of Representatives decided against any reconsideration of the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of human rights lawyers, the Free Legal Assistance  
Group, which represents Echegaray, said they are planning to file a 
motion with the Supreme Court for reconsideration if Echegaray 
agrees. 
</P>
<P>
	The court's decision ``has strengthened our resolve to continue  
to fight for the abolition of the death penalty,'' they said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Echegaray, however, told his wife, Zenaida, that he no longer  
had any hope of stopping his execution. 
</P>
<P>
	``Up to the last moment I will shout to the world that I did not  
rape that child. They'll kill an innocent man,'' Zenaida quoted him 
as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	In the decision, 11 of the 15 justices voted to lift the  
restraint order on Echegaray's execution, saying it was clear 
Congress would not repeal the death penalty law. Two were opposed 
and two other newly appointed justices abstained. 
</P>
<P>
	President Joseph Estrada, who has launched a high-profile  
anti-crime campaign, hailed the decision and urged the lower court 
to set an execution date immediately ``so we can get this over 
with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Estrada has said he will not pardon Echegaray. He also has  
turned down appeals from the Vatican, the European Union and Canada 
to abolish capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision was a blow for Manila's Archbishop Jaime Cardinal  
Sin, the country's most influential church official, who has led a 
campaign against the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Deep in my heart, I'm against it,'' Sin said.  
</P>
<P>
	Echegaray is the first among more than 800 death-row inmates to  
be scheduled for execution. More than 450 of those on death row 
were convicted of rape, including 159 who abused their own children 
or other close relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 13 other death row inmates could be executed this year.  
</P>
<P>
	The court's decision to delay Echegaray's execution set off an  
uproar among many Filipinos exasperated by crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Pro-death penalty protesters staged noisy rallies and the  
Supreme Court received bomb threats. 
</P>
<P>
	Echegaray's lawyers released a study Monday saying there were  
serious flaws in the country's judicial system, which could result 
in the execution of innocent people. 
</P>
<P>
	It also showed that crime has declined since the abolition of  
the death penalty in 1987, raising questions about whether capital 
punishment deters crime, lawyer Maria Socorro Diokno said. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 1924 and 1976, the Philippines executed 84 people.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1987, a new constitution abolished the death penalty but gave  
Congress the option of restoring it for ``heinous'' crimes such 
rape and kidnapping. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislators, alarmed by a rise in crime, brought back capital  
punishment in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Toronto Fingered in IOC Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Amid all the reports of lavish treatment for IOC  
members, this favor seems anything but jet-set -- a government 
forestry job and a modest home in the remote Ontario steel city of 
Sault Ste. Marie. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet revelations that such a job was provided in 1989 to Finnish  
forester Bjarne Haeggman helped convince his ex-wife, Pirjo 
Haeggman, to resign from the IOC on Tuesday -- the first IOC member 
to quit as a result of the steadily widening bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The job with Ontario's Natural Resources Ministry was arranged  
with the help of the Toronto committee that bid to host the 1996 
Summer Games. The committee also paid the Haeggmans' $650-a-month 
rent in Sault Ste. Marie. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators also have alleged that Bjarne Haeggman did  
consulting work in Salt Lake City at the time that city was 
successfully bidding for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Henderson, who was head of the Toronto bid committee,  
insisted in an e-mail sent Monday to Toronto media that the rent 
money was supposed to be repaid by the Haeggmans and was not an 
attempt to win Pirjo Haeggman's vote for Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	But Henderson said he was unsure whether his committee was in  
fact reimbursed and instructed Ron Bertram, the committee's chief 
operating officer, to try to find the records. 
</P>
<P>
	Trevor Isherwood, who at the time was an Ontario forest  
management official, said Henderson flew to Sault Ste. Marie to 
personally push for Bjarne Haeggman to be hired, and later 
pressured the ministry to keep the Finn on the job even though his 
work was lackluster. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he was very interested in working,'' Isherwood  
told the Toronto Sun. 
</P>
<P>
	Isherwood said Haeggman had a masters degree in forestry and was  
qualified for the job, which involved making an inventory of trees 
in Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
	The Finn was given a 20-month contract, was paid about $36,000,  
and quit four days before the IOC vote in September 1990 that 
awarded the 1996 Games to Atlanta. Toronto finished third in the 
voting behind Athens. 
</P>
<P>
	The Haeggmans lived for more than a year in a white wood-paneled  
bungalow in Sault Ste. Marie, a steel and paper-mill city of 80,000 
across the St. Mary's River from Michigan's Upper Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson -- who is in Australia for the world sailing  
championships -- said in his e-mail that his committee made no 
secret of the arrangement with the Haeggmans. He contended that 
even IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch knew about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone knew she was here and both Atlanta and Salt Lake  
(Olympic bid committees) visited her there (Sault Ste. Marie) and 
her address in the IOC Directory stated that,'' Henderson said. 
``And she and I had cleared it through Samaranch and the Finn 
Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was all open and above board.''  
</P>
<P>
	But Henderson confirmed the Toronto committee ended up paying  
the Haeggmans' rent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Sault landlord demanded a better covenant than a (promise  
from) a `Finnish immigrant' and would accept payment only from a 
Canadian account, so TOOC (the Toronto committee) paid,'' Henderson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And to my knowledge, Bjarne was billed by TOOC or was supposed  
to reimburse (TOOC) from his salary since living on the street with 
two young kids in the winter in Sault Ste. Marie was not an 
option.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement from Helsinki, Pirjo Haeggman said she thought  
the rent was paid ``according to the contract by my husband's 
employer. It is a surprise for me that the committee paid the 
rent.''

<HEADLINE> Bonds Prices Are Mostly Lower / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices were mostly lower Tuesday as many  
traders stayed on the sidelines awaiting testimony by Federal 
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 13/32  
point, or $4.06 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, rose to 5.14 percent from 5.12 percent 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. financial markets were closed Monday in observance of  
Martin Luther King Jr. Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan testifies before the House Ways and Means Committee  
Wednesday morning. While investors don't expect any major suprises 
from the testimony, the recent market volatility provoked by 
Brazil's currency devaluation last week still has them on edge. 
</P>
<P>
	A turbulent stock market that finally ended up higher also  
reduced demand for Treasury securities as a safe haven. The Dow 
Jones industrial average rose 14.67 to 9,355.22, while the 
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index posted a new record, rising 
59.97 to 2,408.17. 
</P>
<P>
	In other bond trading Tuesday, prices of short-term Treasury  
securities fell between 1/8 point and 3/16 point, and intermediate 
maturities fell 7/32 point to 1/4 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a 
financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, fell 3.64 
points from Friday to 1,315.55. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.38 percent as the  
discount fell .04 percentage point to 4.28 percent. Six-month 
yields were 4.46 percent as the discount rose 0.03 percentage point 
to 4.31 percent. One-year yields were 4.47 percent as the discount 
rose by 0.02 percentage point from Friday to 4.28 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.38 percent from 4.81 Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell to 124 17/32 from 124 19/32 Friday. The 
average yield to maturity remained unchanged at 5.17 percent.

<HEADLINE> Delta Profits Up; Northwest's Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Delta Air Lines' profits climbed 2 percent in the last three  
months of 1998, benefiting from heavy holiday traveling. But 
Northwest Airlines suffered a $181.3 million loss due to a 15-day 
pilots strike, reversing a profit from a year earlier. 

</P>
<P>
 *Delta Air Lines    	
</P>
<P>
	The nation's third-largest airline reported Tuesday it earned  
$194 million, or $1.29 per diluted share, for its fiscal second 
quarter ended Dec. 31. Delta earned $190 million, or $1.20 per 
share, in the same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta-based Delta reported revenue of $3.45 billion, up  
slightly from $3.43 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The results topped analysts' expectations for earnings of $1.26  
per share, according to First Call Corp. But Delta shares closed 
down 37 1/2 cents at $55.62 1/2 in trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of its current fiscal year, profits  
rose to $520 million, or $3.38 per share, from $443 million, or 
$2.84 per share, in the first half of fiscal 1998. Revenue rose to 
$7.25 billion from $6.99 billion. 

</P>
<P>
 *Northwest Airlines    	
</P>
<P>
	The fourth-quarter loss at Northwest equaled $2.31 per diluted  
share and reversed a profit of $105.4 million, or 97 cents a share, 
in the final quarter of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue at the fourth-largest carrier dropped 11 percent to  
$2.21 billion from $2.49 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding costs related to the strike and other special charges,  
Northwest posted an operating loss of $1.49 per share, less than 
the $1.51-per-share loss analysts' had expected, according to First 
Call. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest shares closed up 31 1/4 cents at $26.81 1/4 on the Nasdaq  
Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest pilots staged a 15-day strike that ended Sept. 12, and  
it took several additional days before the Eagan, Minn.-based 
airline could fully restore its scheduled service. The company 
estimated its fourth-quarter pretax costs to recover from the 
strike were $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest has reached contract agreements with its smaller  
unions but is still in negotiations with unions representing 12,000 
flight attendants, 10,000 mechanics and cleaners and 15,000 other 
ground workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Also hindering fourth-quarter results was a $66 million pretax  
charge related to the retiring seven Boeing 747 aircraft and $36 
million in payments related to Northwest's collective bargaining 
agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, Northwest lost $285.5 million, or $3.48 per  
share, compared to profits of $596.5 million, or $5.21 per share, 
in 1997. Revenue fell to $9.04 billion from $10.22 billion.

<HEADLINE> Bond Funds Offer Broader Choice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Thanks to all the turmoil in the securities  
markets last year, investors in bond mutual funds enjoy a wider 
range of choices than they have seen in quite some time. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the markets went bonkers last summer, there wasn't much  
to distinguish among the various types of bonds. Despite the great 
differences in risk and other characteristics among different bond 
categories, the market was treating them all as members of the 
same, rather dull species. 
</P>
<P>
	But once a serious deflation scare swept through the world's  
financial centers, all that changed. As investors rushed to buy the 
highest-quality bonds and dump everything else, razor-thin yield 
spreads suddenly opened wide. 
</P>
<P>
	As of yearend, noted bond managers at the fund firm of Pioneer  
Investment Management in Boston, yields on mortgage-backed 
securities were about 1.75 percentage points, or 175 basis points, 
above comparable yields on U.S. Treasury securities, marking the 
biggest spread in almost 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``If mortgage prepayments stabilize, this sector would become  
even more attractive,'' said Sherman Russ, co-director of Pioneer's 
U.S. and global fixed-income group. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, he observed, ``intermediate, investment-grade corporate  
bonds offer a 150-basis-point spread over Treasuries, which already 
discounts a considerable slowdown in the economy.'' For lower-rated 
high-yield, or ``junk'' bonds, ``the spread is over 500 basis 
points, more than double equivalent Treasury yields.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The point here is not to recommend any type of bond fund as a  
market-timing opportunity. Wide spreads can always get wider, and 
by themselves they do not necessarily tell you much about which 
type of investment will produce a better absolute return over any 
future period. 
</P>
<P>
	As Sandy Rufenacht, manager of the Janus High-Yield Fund in  
Denver, writes in that fund's annual report, ``Currently, the 
high-yield market appears to be stabilizing ... However, the extent 
to which lower interest rates will help the high-yield market 
depends on whether economic and political conditions calm enough to 
persuade investors to move out of the safety, but reduced yield, of 
Treasury positions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other words, predicting how the markets will behave is a  
chancy business. But even in the midst of that uncertainty, greater 
yield spreads can give you better choices as you decide how to 
allocate your assets. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, high-yield bonds tend to rise and fall with the  
pace of economic activity, behaving a bit like stocks, while 
top-quality bonds move more reflexively up or down in the opposite 
direction from interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	In times when junk bond yields aren't much higher than those of  
higher-quality bonds, investors don't get compensated very well for 
taking the extra risk. But with a wider yield spread, a junk-bond 
fund may make more sense as a kind of compromise between stocks and 
bonds, especially for someone who is worried that the stock market 
might be overvalued. 
</P>
<P>
	As Kenneth Taubes, co-director with Russ in Pioneer's  
bond-management operations, put it: ``This is an asset-allocation 
question rather than a market decision. If an investor already has 
a major allocation to equities and relatively low exposure to cash 
and high-quality fixed income, then high-yield bonds may not be 
appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	``But if the equity allocation is low, high-yield instruments  
should at least be considered. These bonds have already discounted 
a fair amount of slowing in the economy and are trading at 
historically cheap levels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In these high-speed times in the markets, situations that look  
attractive to bond-fund analysts sometimes don't last very long. 
Sheldon Jacobs, who publishes the No-Load Fund Investor newsletter 
in Irivington-on-Hudson, N.Y., issued a recommendation in late 
summer for three funds specializing in the riskiest of all bonds, 
emerging-markets bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We said they would show rewarding gains over a period of  
years,'' Jacobs says. ``Well, the gains came more quickly than 
expected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a jump of about 25 percent in the funds' net asset values  
per share, Jacobs backed off. ``Many issues held in these funds are 
no longer seriously undervalued,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Are There Crocodiles in the Amazon? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *AP Business Analyst    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Some of those Internet stocks have risen so far  
so fast they defy comparison with anything in the past. They are in 
a class by themselves, a rather unruly one where students set the 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
	They put a firecracker under eBay's shares and rocketed it more  
than 1,000 percent in a few months. They put Yahoo! on a catapult 
and snapped the rope. They multiplied Amazon.com's price 55 times 
since it went public. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why can't Johnny add?'' asks Michael Flament as he viewed such  
lack of decorum. Could this be rational, wondered Flament, 
economist and market analyst for Wright Investors' Service, a 
conservative money manager. 
</P>
<P>
	His wonderment led him to America Online's performance, which by  
mid-January had multiplied its market value 200 times over 1999 
earnings. Note: That's 200 times expected earnings, not last year's 
actual earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Does it make any sense?'' he asked after doing some additional  
calculations. He decided to find out how large America Online's 
market value was in terms that could provide some relationship with 
the past. 
</P>
<P>
	This is what he found:  
</P>
<P>
	AOL's market value is as large as the entire Standard &AMP; Poor's  
publishing group, including Dow Jones, McGraw-Hill, Times Mirror, 
Gannett, Knight-Ridder, Tribune Co. and The New York Times -- plus 
Eastman Kodak. 
</P>
<P>
	These are all wonderful companies, tested in the marketplace and  
through various economic conditions. They have long histories, 
great products, lots of real estate, and experienced workers and 
managements. 
</P>
<P>
	Such comparisons, however, serve only to convince some investors  
that stocks such as AOL are once-in-a-lifetime opportunities, and 
others to argue that they are incredibly overpriced. 
</P>
<P>
	Flament, therefore, chose Amazon.com for comparison with a  
relatively newer company most people, perhaps excepting regulators, 
think they understand. Microsoft was the 1980s version of a new-age 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988, when Microsoft's annual sales were in the same $500  
range as Amazon's are now, it was earning $125 million and its 
stock was valued at a high of $4 billion. It had a price-to-sales 
ratio of 8 and a price-to-earnings ratio of 32. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the market value of Amazon stock exceeds $20 billion,  
five times what Microsoft was worth a decade ago. It sells at 40 
times sales and, since it has yet to earn a profit, an infinite P-E 
ratio. 
</P>
<P>
	It took Microsoft's shares almost 10 years from its 1986 initial  
public offering, during which earnings rose nearly 50 percent a 
year, to expand by as much as no-profit Amazon has in little more 
than 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
	With professional reserve, Flament concludes that ``it appears  
then that investors in Amazon.com are making some extremely 
generous assumptions about the potential for selling books on the 
Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It may be argued that nobody can say with certainty that  
Internet stocks are overpriced. Some investors maintain we are in a 
new age were old rules do not apply, and that only the marketplace 
itself has answers. 
</P>
<P>
	That might be true, and probably the majority of investors hope  
it is, but the past, including the recent past, has stories to 
tell, and one of them is how often it's heard that one about the 
dawning of a new era.

<HEADLINE> Crowd Welcomes Korda, Players Don't </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- The crowd, at least, welcomed him  
back. 
</P>
<P>
	Petr Korda walked onto the court for the first match in defense  
of his Australian Open championship to cheers and applause from the 
fans that he won last year with his trademark celebratory scissors 
kick. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he is the center of a drug controversy, has been shunned by  
players who are demanding his suspension and is suffering the 
ignominy of being the first Grand Slam winner since the Open era 
started in 1968 not to be seeded for the defense of his title. 
</P>
<P>
	Korda talks like the controversy doesn't matter to his game.  
With his lawyers defending an appeal by the International Tennis 
Federation against a decision by its own appeals committee which 
stripped the Czech of prize money and ranking points but left him 
still in the game, he refuses to comment about the positive test 
result for the steroid Nandrolone at Wimbledon last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But after struggling for nearly four hours for a five-set  
victory over 83rd-ranked Spaniard Galo Blanco, Korda on Tuesday 
admitted to being unprepared for the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never defended such a big title in my life,'' the  
20th-ranked Korda said. ``I'm just trying to do the best I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Korda is defiant.  
</P>
<P>
	``I always fight and I never give up,'' he said. ``If the guy  
beats me on the court, I always admit that the guy was better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The match was Korda's first in Australia since last year's  
final, and local support was strong among the capacity crowd of 
6,000 at Melbourne Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year you didn't let us down. This year we won't let you  
down,'' read one banner. 
</P>
<P>
	The match was dominated by baseline rallies, and Korda added to  
his woes when he turned his left ankle in the third set. 
</P>
<P>
	Blanco refused to shake Korda's hand after the match, claiming  
the injury was a ploy to gain time to rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Korda denied the injury was faked, saying his ankles had been  
weak since Wimbledon. He said his left ankle was sore and swollen 
and might force him to retire from the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said to the trainer, `I'm not going to give up, I'll be on  
the court until the last ball,' '' Korda said. ``He said it was 
going to be painful. It was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leading 4-3 in the third set when he went down, Korda went on to  
win the match 6-3, 6-7 (1-7), 6-4, 6-7 (4-7), 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Korda also denied being disappointed at not being given center  
court to defend his title. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't ask to play on the Show Court if your ranking is  
20,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I respect wherever they put me. As my father always told me:  
`It doesn't matter where you play, you can play on the potato field 
with triangular balls, but you have to play tennis.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Korda is spending as much time as possible with his wife and two  
daughters during the tournament, and avoiding the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the first week of a Grand Slam it is always difficult, a  
lot of people in the locker room,'' he said. ``Every year I spend 
less time. I don't even eat here, I eat in the hotel, try to listen 
to music. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to enjoy tennis and to play tennis.''

<HEADLINE> Dennis Hayes Quits Hayes Corp. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORCROSS, Ga. (AP) -- Dennis Hayes has resigned from the board of  
the company that bears his name, severing his official connection 
with Hayes Corp., the modem maker that has been under bankruptcy 
protection since October. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayes, who resigned as chairman last fall, gave up his position  
on the board of directors Monday. He said the move is designed to 
free him from potential conflict with the company. 
</P>
<P>
	``From a personal perspective, the past year has been very  
stressful,'' he said. ``I have had to watch things that were 
difficult to observe and not be able to change the outcome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hayes, who remains the company's largest individual shareholder,  
said he hopes to stay involved in the industry, where the shift to 
broadband communications is creating new opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayes co-founded the company, which was once the dominant maker  
of analog modems, in 1978. Manufacturing at the suburban Atlanta 
company was shuttered in November, and most of the rest of 
operations ceased Jan. 4.

<HEADLINE> Test Performed on King Probe Papers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two documents that a former FBI agent said he  
took from James Earl Ray's car in 1968 after the assassination of 
the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. have passed one scientific test 
designed to detect whether they are bogus, a federal official says. 
</P>
<P>
	But the results do not prove the documents are authentic or that  
they clear Ray in the murder, the official said Monday on condition 
of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The former agent, Donald Wilson, came forward last March with  
the two documents, which he said he had kept hidden for 30 years 
after the civil rights leader's assassination. An FBI spokesman at 
that time called them fabrications. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson's documents both have the name ``Raul'' written on them.  
Shortly after Ray pleaded guilty in 1969 to the King killing in 
return for a 99-year sentence, he recanted and claimed he was set 
up by a smuggler he knew only as Raul. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray died in prison in April at age 70 from liver disease,  
unsuccessful in his long bid to obtain a trial. The King family 
supported his efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tests can't establish authenticity, but they can determine  
if a document is bogus in certain ways. One test failed to show the 
documents were bogus,'' the federal official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other tests are planned, this official said. ``Investigators  
still have doubts about them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the test results fall short of confirming the  
documents' validity, Wilson told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, 
which first reported the results, that he believed the test was ``a 
very positive development.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't extricate Ray from the arena of responsibility, but  
it gives credibility to the existence of this mystery man Raul,'' 
Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's encouraging,'' said King's son, Dexter Scott King. ``I  
hope this will lead to something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In August, Attorney General Janet Reno ordered a limited probe  
into two developments that have come to light since King's 
assassination in Memphis, Tenn., on April 4, 1968: Wilson's 
documents and a public statement by former restaurant owner Lloyd 
Jowers that a mobster paid him $100,000 to hire a hit man. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno approved a limited investigation by the Justice  
Department's civil rights division into the two allegations, which 
had not been fully examined by earlier federal probes of the King 
killing. King's widow, Coretta Scott King, and her four children 
had urged President Clinton and Reno to begin a broader probe by 
setting up a national commission with power to offer immunity for 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis Garrison, Jowers' attorney, told The Journal-Constitution  
that his client wants to receive immunity before talking with 
Justice Department investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're calling and writing pretty regularly,'' Garrison said  
of the federal investigators. ``But he's still a little fearful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jowers, 72 and in ill health, owned a restaurant on the ground  
floor of the building from which authorities say Ray fired the 
fatal shot from a second-floor bathroom window. Jowers has told the 
Kings that the shot came from a brushy area behind the restaurant 
and that the shooter handed him the rifle moments after the 
assassination. Jowers claims to have hidden the rifle and then 
given it to an unnamed conspirator the next morning.

<HEADLINE>  Rodman Is Retiring -- Or Is He? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Worm took an unexpected turn. In another  
curious lifestyle choice, Dennis Rodman has retired -- or has he? 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after his agent announced Tuesday that Rodman was  
``retiring,'' the NBA's most outlandish player denied it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to play this year,'' Rodman told Fox Sports  
News. ``I am in limbo, but I'm not going to say I'm retired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And once again -- just like his bizarre wedding to Carmen Electra  
-- it showed that nothing with Rodman is ever quite certain. 
</P>
<P>
	In a strange twist earlier in the day, his former coach, Chuck  
Daly of the Orlando Magic, said he had heard Rodman had been traded 
to the New York Knicks for Buck Williams -- a rumor that was quickly 
shot down. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, whose multicolored hair, body piercings and tattoos made  
a fashion statement across the NBA and beyond, has become the 
latest star to leave Chicago as the Bulls rebuild after the 
retirement of Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	But is he gone for good?  
</P>
<P>
	The seven-time rebounding leader who once donned a wedding gown,  
kicked a cameraman, head-butted a referee and dated Madonna is 
leaving the game, Rodman's agent said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dennis is retiring,'' Dwight Manley said, although Rodman has  
considered retiring in each of the last five years. ``He doesn't 
want to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He wants to go into the sports and entertainment field. Some  
people have convinced him that he wants to become a movie star.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manley got the news from Rodman in a phone conversation Tuesday  
and said there are several teams still interested in signing the 
wacky 37-year-old Rodman, known for his ferocious workouts and 
frequent forays to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Manley, who said he is severing his relationship with Rodman,  
declined to identify the teams that are interested in him. 
</P>
<P>
	One team not interested is Chicago, which is housecleaning this  
week following the retirement of Jordan. Scottie Pippen, Luc 
Longley and Steve Kerr are all headed to new teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman won three championships with the Bulls in 1996, 1997 and  
1998, and two titles with the Detroit Pistons in 1989 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	But off the court is where Rodman marketed himself and became a  
marked man for his antics and ventures into poor taste. 
</P>
<P>
	He once announced his marriage, only to show up at a New York  
book signing in a wedding gown and blond wig -- sans groom; he 
offended Mormons and was fined $50,000 for making derogatory 
comments during the 1997 finals in Salt Lake City; he skipped 
practice during the NBA Finals last summer to attend a wrestling 
match in Detroit, and later as ``Rodzilla'' teamed with Hulk Hogan 
to beat Karl Malone and Diamond Dallas Page. 
</P>
<P>
	He drew a six-game suspension for head-butting referee Ted  
Bernhardt in 1996 and drew another for 11 games in 1997 for kicking 
a courtside cameraman in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	He was always in trouble, first with the Pistons; then during  
his brief stay in San Antonio, where his behavior damaged Spurs' 
chances at the NBA title; and finally during his three 
championships years with the Bulls, where he became a Chicago 
favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman became popular in his first season with the Bulls for  
taking his No. 91 jersey off and throwing it into the stands after 
every home game. 
</P>
<P>
	His tardiness and selfish antics often tested his teammates'  
patience and that of coach Phil Jackson, who handled him as well as 
anyone could. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson once suggested an ultimate therapy for his bad-boy board  
man. 
</P>
<P>
	``Electric shock is the next treatment,'' Jackson said.  
</P>
<P>
	Rodman has appeared in movies and TV shows, had a stint on MTV,  
and wrote his life story, ``Bad As I Wanna Be,'' that became a 
bestseller. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been sued -- most recently by a cocktail waitress who said  
he jammed a $100 bill down her blouse and grabbed her breast. 
</P>
<P>
	The man who once courted Madonna recently married Electra, his  
longtime girlfriend, although days later there were reports of an 
annulment filing. 
</P>
<P>
	In another bizarre chapter, however, the former ``Baywatch''  
actress later denied the marriage was off. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman didn't need the ball to be effective. His career scoring  
average was just 7.5 points, but at 6-foot-8 he was one of the 
great rebounders in league history with a 13.2 average and seven 
straight titles. 
</P>
<P>
	He had an uncanny sense of where the ball would come off the  
rim, in addition to the ability to tip rebounds to himself with his 
long arms. 
</P>
<P>
	And he was also one of the game's most bothersome defenders --  
grabbing, shoving and holding under the basket -- to the frustration 
of his opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	Then-Seattle coach George Karl accused Rodman of flopping to  
draw fouls during the 1996 finals, but he also was quick to say 
Rodman was the difference in a grueling six-game series with the 
Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman set various school records for shooting and rebounding  
during his career at Southeastern Oklahoma State from 1983 to 1985. 
He led the Savages to a third-place finish in the NAIA his senior 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	His jersey has been retired at the school in Durant, which also  
inducted Rodman into its Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's helped us in recruiting,'' said Southeastern coach Tony  
Robinson. ``Kids are always calling, interested in the school 
Dennis Rodman played in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson did not coach Rodman but did watch him play. Robinson  
described Rodman as tough and competitive as a student. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was, believe it or not, real quiet and shy when he played  
here,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman was selected by the Pistons in the second round of 1986  
and spent seven years there before being traded to the Spurs in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	He came to the Bulls in 1995 and blended with Jordan and Pippen  
to help Chicago capture three straight titles.

<HEADLINE> Kemppel Wins 5k Ski Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RUMFORD, Maine (AP) -- Three-time Olympic skier Nina Kemppel of  
Anchorage, Alaska, made it two straight national titles Tuesday, 
winning the women's 5-kilometer classic race while local favorite 
Marcus Nash won the men's race. 
</P>
<P>
	After a night of heavy rain that ended before dawn, Kemppel won  
the race in 14 minutes, 10.9 seconds. University of Vermont racer 
Tessa Benoit of South Pomfret, Vt., drew closer to a ticket to the 
Nordic World Championships with her second top-three result in 
14:38.4 and Wendy Wagner of Park City, Utah, completed the podium. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't expect to see the courses in this good condition  
after the rains we had,'' Kemppel said, ``but Chisholm Ski Club has 
been known to pull off miracles, so I shouldn't have been 
surprised.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She felt stronger as the race, as brief as it was, went on,  
noting ``I really felt good over the last 2 1/2 Ks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nash, whose mother Mary, a doctor in Fryeburg, Maine, came to  
watch, edged his roommate and two-time Olympic teammate, Justin 
Wadsworth of Bend, Ore., for his fourth national title. His time 
was 24:59.2 to 25:22.8 for Wadsworth. John Bauer of Duluth, Minn., 
who won Saturday's 30K opener, was third. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't have my roommate, just back from a separated  
shoulder -- with his arm in a sling for the last month -- beat me. 
I'd never hear the end of it,'' Nash laughed. 
</P>
<P>
	Rob Whitney of Anchorage, Alaska, was the top junior in the  
men's race, finishing seventh overall, while Rebecca Quinn of 
Gunnison, Colo., again led the junior women with another 
fourth-place finish. Five men and five women will be named Thursday 
night, after the next races, to compete Feb. 3-7 in the World 
Junior Championships at Saalfelden, Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, five men and four women will be picked next Sunday  
when the championships conclude to compete in the World 
Championships Feb. 18-28 at Ramsau, Austria.

<HEADLINE> NBA Settlement Delayed Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- All sorts of deals are being made, from Scottie  
Pippen heading to the Houston Rockets to Latrell Sprewell going to 
the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Those transactions will be finalized as soon as the NBA lockout  
settlement is put into writing and signed, but that process 
continues to be delayed. Teams received a memo today from the 
league office saying training camps will not open until Thursday at 
the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
	The day-to-day delays haven't stopped teams from moving ahead  
with plans to reshuffle players in anticipation of the season 
starting Feb. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Bulls agreed to a sign-and-trade deal sending Pippen  
to the Rockets for forward Roy Rogers and a second-round draft 
pick, and the Knicks were set to acquire Latrell Sprewell from 
Golden State for John Starks and Chris Mills, numerous league 
sources told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, top free agent Antonio McDyess was expected to choose  
between Denver and Phoenix by the end of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Also:  
</P>
<P>
	--Minnesota, Toronto and Denver agreed on a three-way trade  
sending guard Chauncey Billups to the Nuggets, center Dean Garrett 
and guard Bobby Jackson to the Timberwolves and guard Micheal 
Williams and two No. 1 picks to the Raptors. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Bulls signed and traded guard Steve Kerr and center Luc  
Longley, with Kerr going to San Antonio, and Longley headed to 
Phoenix for forward Martin Muursepp, forward-center Mark Bryant and 
guard-forward Bubba Wells. 
</P>
<P>
	--New Jersey reportedly acquired center Jim McIlvaine from  
Seattle for forwards Michael Cage and Don MacLean. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Los Angeles Lakers sent forward Tony Battie to Boston for  
center Travis Knight. 
</P>
<P>
	--Vlade Divac is waiting for McDyess to decide before he goes to  
Phoenix, Denver or Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
	All of those deals cannot be completed until league and union  
lawyers put the settlement into writing. In addition, both sides 
are trying to resolve several differences that have arisen. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll know for sure (today) whether we'll be starting  
Wednesday or Thursday,'' league spokesman Chris Brienza said. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest disagreement concerns the new average salary  
exception, which allows teams already over the salary cap to sign 
an extra free agent. The union wants the exception to be used for 
six-year contracts; the league wants it limited to three-year 
deals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls will sign Pippen to a deal worth $67.2 million for  
five years before trading him. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the salaries for Pippen and Rogers do not match, the  
deal is allowable under NBA rules because Houston will have enough 
salary cap room to fit in Pippen's contract. His salary for this 
season will be $10.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen, a six-time champion with the Bulls, had talked to the  
Rockets about signing with them as a free agent. He apparently 
agreed to the sign-and-trade deal because it allows him to make 
more money than Houston could have offered. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition of Pippen should clear the way for Charles  
Barkley to re-sign with Houston for the $1 million minimum, giving 
the Rockets a formidable front line of Barkley, Pippen and Hakeem 
Olajuwon, and allowing Barkley to keep his Larry Bird-exception 
rights for another year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am excited about my new career in Houston, and even though  
everything seems to be changing, I hope Bulls fans everywhere will 
understand that it is time for a new era to begin in Chicago,'' 
Pippen said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chicago has been my home for nearly half my life, and with  
family and friends here I will always treat the city as home. I 
only hope the city of Chicago will continue to treat me as one of 
their own. Thanks for all the great memories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks emerged as the leading contender in the Sprewell  
sweepstakes after Golden State general manager Garry St. Jean told 
all the interested teams to make their best offers by 4 p.m. EST 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell, a three-time All-Star, drew the longest  
nondrug-related suspension in league history last season for 
choking his coach, P.J. Carlesimo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks will send Starks and Mills to the Warriors, two  
league sources said today. New York originally offered Mills and 
guard Chris Childs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks, Heat and Pacers had been known to be the leading  
bidders, and the AP learned that a complicated four-team trade 
involving Golden State, Miami, Cleveland and Boston also was 
discussed. 
</P>
<P>
	In that scenario, Sprewell would have gone to the Heat along  
with Bimbo Coles and Clarence Weatherspoon, with Golden State 
getting Brent Barry, Dan Majerle and Bobby Sura. Boston would have 
received Jamal Mashburn and Vitaly Potapenko, and Cleveland would 
have received Paul Pierce and Andrew Declercq. 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess is expected to decide today between re-signing with  
Phoenix or going to Denver. The Rockets and Bulls were among his 
earlier choices. 
</P>
<P>
	``Houston and Chicago are out of the picture,'' agent James  
Bryant said. ``Tony has analyzed the situation carefully, and he's 
most at home with those two options: Phoenix is going to stay a 
winner and Denver is going to be a winner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If McDyess stays in Phoenix, the Nuggets are expected to make a  
final push for Divac or Timberwolves free agent forward Tom 
Gugliotta. If McDyess returns to Denver, where he played in the 
1995-96 and 1996-97 seasons, the Suns' fallback plan would be to 
sign Divac to play alongside Longley. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports out of Belgrade said Divac would sign with Sacramento,  
but to do so the Kings would have to renounce the rights to Corliss 
Williamson to have enough cap space to pay Divac. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-way trade involving the Timberwolves, Raptors and  
Nuggets had been rumored since Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP learned of the Battie-Knight trade from two league  
sources. It will reunite Knight with the Lakers, the team he played 
for before signing with Boston as a free agent. The Lakers acquired 
Battie from the Denver Nuggets in last June's Nick Van Exel trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerr will sign with the Bulls for $11 million over five years,  
then be shipped to the Spurs. San Antonio was undecided on exactly 
who it would send back to the Bulls, although Monty Williams was a 
possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Other previously undisclosed deals in the works:  
</P>
<P>
	--Clippers free agent forward Loy Vaught was close to accepting a  
five-year offer from Detroit for about $23 million. 
</P>
<P>
	--Rockets guard Matt Maloney was expected to re-sign with  
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	--Hawks free agent guard Eldridge Recasner was close to agreeing  
to a deal with Charlotte for four years and $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	--Celtics center Popeye Jones was expected to re-sign with Boston  
for $8 million over three years. 
</P>
<P>
	--Wizards forward Harvey Grant was headed to Philadelphia for two  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The league and union also were squabbling over changes to  
``circumvention'' rules. The league wants to prohibit wink-and-nod 
deals in which a team would sign a free agent for one year with the 
unwritten understanding that a long-term deal would follow using 
the Bird exception. The union contends changes to that rule were 
never discussed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we have a realistic chance of getting it done by the  
end of (Tuesday),'' union lawyer Jeffrey Kessler said.

<HEADLINE> Dems To Rally 'Round the TV Set </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- With chicken wings on the menu, beer on tap and a  
big-screen television on hand, area college students planned to 
party at a local bar for ... the State of the Union address? 
</P>
<P>
	That's right. Tonight's speech by President Clinton is sparking  
Super Bowl-like viewing parties by Democrats seeking to boost 
morale during the trial of the president. 
</P>
<P>
	And Washington is helping with the celebrations. When word got  
out that Toby Chaudhuri was planning a State of the Union Watch 
party for Boston-area students, he said representatives from the 
White House and Democratic National Committee immediately called 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've upped the grassroots communication at the White House  
since the impeachment,'' said Chaudhuri, chairman of the College 
Democrats of Massachusetts and a University of 
Massachusetts-Amherst student. 
</P>
<P>
	Chaudhuri said he received an e-mail from the White House just  
days before Clinton's lawyers were to present his impeachment 
defense, asking him to invite local activists to the party and 
inform the White House so it could tell the media about the crowds 
of Clinton supporters rallying around their television sets. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the missive, from the president's deputy assistant, Ben  
Johnson, had a postscript: ``I can't begin to tell you how 
important this is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State of the Union parties are nothing new. But since the  
impeachment trial, Democratic operatives have been working overtime 
to drum up support. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton supporters have planned similar parties all over the  
country -- at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, at the First 
Iconium Baptist Church in Atlanta, at the Bellevue City Park in 
Seattle and at union halls, college campuses and sports bars. 
</P>
<P>
	Some, like Kevin McGraph, Democratic Town Committee Chairman in  
Milford, Conn., decided to hold the gatherings without any 
prompting. He plans to watch the speech at a neighbor's house with 
two dozen fellow Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Greta Moran, Hillsboro County Democratic chairwoman in New  
Hampshire, plans on having 15-20 people over to her home in 
Merrimack, where they'll get a chance to talk about Clinton's 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	For novice party givers, the DNC has a whole organizing packet  
for a ``Get Back To Work! State of the Union House Party'' that 
includes a pledge card, an invitation and a sample word processing 
document to create flyers. 
</P>
<P>
	The DNC even invited each organizer to participate in a  
conference call today with the DNC general chairman, Gov. Roy Romer 
of Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before the absolute necessity to have things like this, it was  
just sort of a fun event to bring people together for a common 
purpose,'' said Janice Campbell, a Boston University senior who 
plans to attend Chaudhuri's party at Crossroads Tavern. ``Now we 
want to show in a recognizable way our solidarity for the 
president.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Deliver State of Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- On trial in the Senate, President Clinton goes  
before Congress and the nation tonight to make the case for his 
presidency with a State of the Union address setting an ``ambitious 
and activist agenda'' for the remainder of his administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's challenge was to generate interest in his proposals  
among lawmakers still caught up in the impeachment proceedings 
against him, and aides said his speech would be brimming with ideas 
on education, health care, Social Security and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the end of the speech, people will look not at an  
administration that has entered the last two years of office and is 
slowing down, but an administration that is energized and is 
looking forward to moving into the 21st century with an ambitious 
and activist agenda,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the address fell on the same day Clinton's defense team  
began its presentation in the Senate, and White House officials 
conceded that the GOP-controlled Congress wouldn't rush to 
rubber-stamp the agenda of a chief executive many Republicans want 
to see removed from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Undaunted, Clinton's plan was to continue to portray himself  
hard at work on the nation's business, outlining initiatives to 
shore up the Social Security system and renewing calls to build new 
schools, overhaul the campaign finance system and increase the 
minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Clinton challenged Congress to reserve all of the  
burgeoning budget surplus to ``save Social Security first.'' This 
year, the catch phrase is to ``save Social Security now,'' Lockhart 
said. Clinton is proposing to use most of the surplus to build cash 
reserves of the big retirement system and to subsidize 401(k)-style 
accounts that would exist in addition to Social Security benefits, 
but not replace them. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials said the president was prepared to  
challenge Republicans who want to use the surplus for tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's have a good national debate on whether we think ... we  
should use this 15-year surplus from our prosperity and fiscal 
discipline to just enjoy more consumption now, or whether we should 
try to save it in a way that takes care of our major Medicare and 
Social Security savings issues and frees up the next generation to 
not have to deal with this burden,'' said presidential economic 
adviser Gene Sperling. ``That's a good debate we look forward to 
having.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton planned to embrace a minimum-wage proposal sponsored by  
Sen. Edward Kennedy, D- Mass., calling for a 50-cent increase in 
the hourly base pay in September 1999, and another in September 
2000, bringing the rate to $6.15 an hour. A similar plan was 
defeated last year. 
</P>
<P>
	He also will call for a new round of trade negotiations as an  
answer to the current global economic turmoil. The talks would be 
launched in December at a U.S. meeting of the more than 120 nations 
that are members of the World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	And an administration official said the president will seek $1  
billion in block grants to the states to continue the 
welfare-to-work program begun two years ago for another year. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was scheduled to deliver his address at 9 p.m. EST in  
the House chamber before Congress and a live television and radio 
audience. It was here that on Dec. 19 a House bitterly divided 
along party lines voted to impeach him, marking the first time 
since 1868 that a president faced trial in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republicans had urged Clinton to delay his visit to Capitol  
Hill, and senior GOP senators were encouraging colleagues to adopt 
a stoic demeanor for the speech. Dennis Hastert, the new House 
speaker, asked colleagues to be courteous despite ``discomfort'' 
over the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``Out of respect for the office of the presidency and for the  
state of our union, we will listen to the president's remarks 
soberly and with the dignity that befits the United States 
Congress,'' Hastert wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was expected to seek a $110 billion increase in Pentagon  
spending over six years and ask the Congress to allow Americans as 
young as 55 buy into Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	The president has already said that his fiscal 2000 budget to be  
announced next month will seek tax incentives to encourage Wall 
Street to invest in underserved rural and inner-city communities. 
On Monday Education Secretary Richard Riley previewed one of the 
administration's education priorities: to hold states and school 
districts accountable for the achievements of students and 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	The threat to withhold some federal education money from states  
that fail to end social promotions and set standards won the 
enthusiastic approval of a key labor constituency. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very useful for the federal government to put its clout  
behind the kind of things that a number school districts are now 
doing,'' said Sandra Feldman, president of the American Federation 
of Teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Monday, the administration said Clinton would propose a tax  
credit of up to $500 per child, age 1 or younger, to offset costs 
for parents who choose to stay home to care for their kids. The 
proposal is part of a larger child care package that seeks $18 
billion over five years to aid working poor and middle-class 
families. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration also floated a proposal for $1 billion over  
five years to improve health care for many of the nation's 32 
million uninsured adults. The money would be used to encourage 
community clinics and hospitals to work together to keep track of 
patients and make sure they get needed treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	On foreign policy, he will emphasize the importance of fighting  
terrorism and call on the Senate again to ratify the Comprehensive 
Test Ban Treaty. Clinton will call for expanding cooperation and 
assistance to the former Soviet Union to strengthen the safety and 
security of nuclear stockpiles, proposing incentives for Russian 
weapons experts to study nonmilitary research.

<HEADLINE> Conference USA Criticizes Referee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Conference USA has publicly criticized an  
official for a call he made in the final seconds of Cincinnati's 
loss to UNC Charlotte last week, but the league office said the 
result will not be overturned. 
</P>
<P>
	With 17.5 seconds left in UNC Charlotte's 62-60 victory,  
official Tom O'Neill blew his whistle on a missed one-and-one free 
throw situation. Cincinnati rebounded the miss, then Melvin Levett 
hit a 3-pointer, but the officials ruled the play dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Conference USA commissioner Mike Slive reviewed the play Monday  
with Dale Kelley, the league's supervisor of officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Slive issued a statement saying it was apparent that  
the ball was live after the missed free throw attempt by UNC 
Charlotte, and that Cincinnati should have been allowed to continue 
to play after the rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	``The conference has departed from its normal policy of not  
commenting publicly on officiating matters because of the obvious 
lapse by the official and the fact that this was not a judgment 
call,'' the statement said. ``The conference regrets this error.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conference USA said any reprimand of O'Neill would be dealt with  
internally.

<HEADLINE> White House Team To Hit Details </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After White House Counsel Charles Ruff's  
slashing oratory, the president's legal team will move to the 
details of the impeachment case over the last two days of their 
opening presentation. And then senators will get their first chance 
to ask questions of the two sides. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials said Special Counsel Gregory Craig will  
open Wednesday's session attacking the evidence used by House 
prosecutors to charge that Clinton lied at least four times before 
a federal grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	He is to be followed by White House Deputy Counsel Cheryl Mills,  
who will analyze the evidence of alleged obstruction of justice in 
Oval Office Secretary Betty Currie's retrieval of presidential 
gifts from Monica Lewinsky after the gifts had been subpoenaed in 
December 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said Craig is likely to attack the House prosecutors'  
assertion that Clinton lied before the grand jury when he testified 
that ``I wasn't paying a great deal of attention'' and ``I said 
things that were true'' in his earlier sworn answers about Ms. 
Lewinsky in the Paula Jones case. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig will argue the president wasn't affirming the accuracy of  
his earlier testimony and was simply trying to describe his state 
of mind and intentions, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the president's private attorney, David Kendall,  
will dissect the rest of the evidence offered by House prosecutors 
in their impeachment article accusing Clinton of obstruction. 
Kendall is expected to be followed by former Sen. Dale Bumpers, 
D-Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning Friday, Republican and Democratic senators will be  
able to ask questions of the prosecution and defense teams, 
submitting their queries through Chief Justice William Rehnquist. 
Senators will have 16 hours over two days to ask questions, with 
the time evenly divided between the two parties in two hour 
segments.

<HEADLINE> Bizzy Bone Convicted of Assault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- A student barber's complaint accusing  
rapper Bizzy Bone of dragging him down a flight of stairs was 
motivated by greed, a lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bone Thugs-N-Harmony rapper, whose real name is Byron  
McCane, could face up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine if 
convicted of assault and disorderly conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	McCane, 22, confronted Terrance Harden at the Hair Experts  
Barber School on Sept. 16 to find out why he had been spreading 
rumors about him, defense lawyer Randy Treneff said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think both of them (McCane and Harden) thought when they met  
in such a public place that it was going to be an amiable 
meeting,'' Treneff told jurors Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the discussion became heated, and two of the rapper's  
bodyguards -- who were not charged -- grabbed Harden as he tried to 
attack McCane, the lawyer said. McCane denies that he hurt Harden. 
</P>
<P>
	Treneff said Harden filed the complaint because he was looking  
for money from McCane, whose band won the 1997 Grammy Award for 
best rap performance by a duo or group.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Slips, Japanese Stocks Lower / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar slipped against the yen today as the  
market continued to watch developments in Brazil. Japanese stocks 
fell in light trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 34.62 points,  
or 0.25 percent, closing the day's trading at 13,770.44. On Monday, 
the average gained 66.20 points, or 0.48 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In late afternoon, the dollar bought 114.04 yen, down 0.10 yen  
from late in Tokyo on Monday and also below its late New York level 
of 114.35 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar initially gained ground against the yen in Tokyo as  
the market was encouraged by Brazil's decision to float its 
currency and to move ahead with reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Brazil's central bank made permanent a temporary  
decision last week to allow the real to trade at market rates in 
foreign exchange trading without any intervention. The move risks 
sparking a new surge of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States fears that if Brazil falls into an Asian style  
currency crisis, its economy Latin America's largest could drag 
down other nations in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Many traders, however, remained cautious about the stability of  
regional markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still have to wait and see whether Brazil is really going  
to recover,'' said Akihiko Ena, foreign exchange manager at Nippon 
Trust Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 113.80 yen and 114.95 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the euro was quoted at 132.46 yen, up from 132.34 yen  
late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, traders said the market reacted  
little to the afternoon opening of the new regular session of 
Japan's Parliament, where Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi again pledged 
to do his best to ensure economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to pessimistic news, the government said in a closely  
watched monthly report today that despite mild improvements, the 
economy remains mired in a prolonged slump. 
</P>
<P>
	While there appeared some signs of improvement, employment and  
corporate capital investment deteriorated, leaving the overall 
state of the economy ``very severe,'' the Economic Planning Agency 
said in its report for December. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of Japanese bankruptcy cases was the highest last  
year since 1984, while the amount of liabilities left was the 
largest since World War II, according to a report released today by 
Teikoku Databank, a private credit research agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan is stuck in its worst recession since World War II, as  
debt-ridden financial institutions cut back on lending, starving 
companies of cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 308  
million shares, down from Monday's turnover of 334 million shares. 
Advances outnumbered declines 602 to 487, with 186 issues 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 0.99 points, or 0.09 percent, to 1,074.80. 
The TOPIX closed up 5.85 points, or 0.55 percent, Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.865 percent from 1.725 percent Monday, driving its 
price down to 99.47 yen from 100.60 yen.

	Highlights from Tuesday's impeachment proceedings against  
President Clinton: 
</P>
<P>
	--White House Counsel Charles F.C. Ruff presented opening  
arguments to the Senate on behalf of President Clinton, arguing 
that the president ``is not guilty of the charges that have been 
preferred against him. He did not commit perjury. He did not 
obstruct justice. He must not be removed from office.''

	--Ruff also said there was a lack of specificity in the charges  
against the president, arguing, ``There is not a court anywhere, 
highest to lowest, that would hesitate, if they were confronted 
with an indictment written like these articles, to throw it out.'' 
Ruff went on to call the articles ``empty vessels to be filled with 
some witches brew of charges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Ruff closed his presentation emotionally, asking, ``Are we at  
that horrific moment in our history when our union can be preserved 
only by taking the step that the framers saw as a last resort?'' 
</P>
<P>
	--The White House abandoned plans to have congressional Democrats  
present segments of the defense arguments. However, former Sen. 
Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., will present part of the defense, and joined 
Clinton's lawyers at the defense table in the Senate on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	--President Clinton spent much of the day preparing for his State  
of the Union speech Tuesday night.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Hearing Resumes in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The House of Lords may need to pinpoint exactly  
when Gen. Augusto Pinochet was recognized formally as Chile's 
leader in order to decide if he is entitled to immunity from arrest 
in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, lawyers for Spain and Britain argued before Britain's  
highest court that Pinochet came to power in 1973 as head of a 
military junta, which is not the same as being a head of state. 
</P>
<P>
	They contend that any crimes he committed in that capacity would  
not be covered under Britain's state immunity laws, which protect 
heads of state from prosecution for actions taken in their official 
capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet's lawyers, meanwhile, claim he was recognized as head  
of state immediately after the Sept. 11, 1973 coup that toppled an 
elected Marxist president, Salvador Allende. 
</P>
<P>
	That argument is just one of the tricky legal issues facing  
Britain's highest court, which resumes the hearing today to decide 
for a second time whether the 83-year-old general can be charged in 
Britain with gross violations of human rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The general's fate was sent back to the House of Lords after it  
set aside its own 3-2 ruling denying Pinochet immunity. The law 
lords, a panel from the House of Lords that heard the case, 
conceded last month that one judge who voted against Pinochet had 
close ties with Amnesty International, a human rights group 
campaigning to put the general on trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet, who remains under police guard in a rented mansion  
west of London, was arrested on a Spanish warrant Oct. 16 alleging 
crimes against humanity that included the deaths of Spaniards 
during his 1973-90 regime. 
</P>
<P>
	The aging general's lawyers have argued that his arrest is  
illegal under British law because the alleged acts were carried out 
when he was head of state. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't accept that a head of a junta is the same as a head  
of state,'' said Alun Jones, a lawyer for the governments of 
Britain and Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones also argued that some new allegations suggest Pinochet  
directed his supporters to commit murder, torture and 
hostage-taking in the days before the coup -- and therefore before 
he could claim immunity. 
</P>
<P>
	These allegations are part of Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon's  
full case against Pinochet. Garzon was in court Monday, but did not 
speak. 
</P>
<P>
	If Pinochet again loses, a lengthy extradition battle will  
begin. If he wins, he will be free to go home. 
</P>
<P>
	An official Chilean report says 3,197 people were murdered or  
disappeared at the hands of Pinochet's secret police after he 
seized power.

<HEADLINE> Court Won't Revive Ticketmaster Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) --Pop concertgoers who accuse Ticketmaster of  
using its dominance in the ticket-sales business to boost service 
charges lost a Supreme Court appeal today. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, without comment, refused to revive ticket buyers'  
effort to force Ticketmaster to pay triple damages for alleged 
overcharges. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit accused Ticketmaster of monopolizing the  
ticket-sales business for large popular music concerts and of using 
its advantage to charge sales and handling fees as high as $20 per 
ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	Ticketmaster has exclusive contracts with almost every major  
concert promoter and with concert venues representing 63 percent of 
the nation's concert hall seats, the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit accused Ticketmaster of engaging in price-fixing  
with those promoters and concert venues, and of boycotting the rock 
band Pearl Jam, which had a running feud with Ticketmaster over the 
size of its service charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit sought triple damages and a court order requiring  
Ticketmaster to stop such practices. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge in St. Louis dismissed the claim for damages,  
saying the ticket buyers lacked legal standing to sue. The 8th U.S. 
Circuit Court of Appeals agreed, although it said the ticket buyers 
still could seek a court order to bar any future violations of law. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Supreme Court precedent, damages for price-fixing can be  
sought only by someone who directly bought something from a seller. 
Indirect purchasers do not have standing to sue. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court said concert venues are the direct purchasers  
of Ticketmaster's services. Ticket buyers are indirect purchasers 
and therefore they cannot sue, the appeals court concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, the ticket buyers' lawyers said  
the 8th Circuit court ruling effectively makes Ticketmaster immune 
from such lawsuits. The concert venues have no incentive to sue 
because they reap a share of the ticket fees, the appeal said. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyers agreed with Ticketmaster's attorneys  
that the buyers cannot seek damages from the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Campos vs. Ticketmaster, 98-127.

<HEADLINE> Some in GOP Skip Clinton Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Several Republicans decided to boycott  
President Clinton's State of the Union address Tuesday, saying it 
was inappropriate for Clinton to appear before Congress during his 
impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president is demonstrating his lack of respect for the  
Congress,'' Reps. John Shadegg, R-Ariz., and Bob Schaffer, R-Colo., 
wrote in a letter to their GOP colleagues explaining why they 
wouldn't attend the speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not play a role in facilitating his disrespect,'' they  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also conspicuously absent when the justices of the Supreme Court  
entered the House chamber was Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who 
is presiding over the Senate trial deciding whether to remove 
Clinton from office. Rehnquist's aides reportedly had questioned 
whether it was appropriate for him to attend the speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Schaffer, in an interview before the speech, said he was staying  
away out of respect for the presidency, which he said Clinton had 
``defiled'' by his affair with Monica Lewinsky. Permitting the 
speech to go forward, he said, was ``conveying a sense of normalcy 
to the country and to the world that I think is inaccurate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most Republicans, however, decided to follow the lead of new  
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., who wrote in a letter Friday 
that despite the ``discomfort,'' Congress had a duty to hear the 
views of the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``Out of respect for the office of the presidency, and for the  
state of our union, we will listen to the president's remarks 
soberly and with the dignity that befits the United States 
Congress,'' Hastert said. 
</P>
<P>
	There were also no reports of Democrats who planned to skip the  
speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Freshman Rep. Tom Tancredo, R-Colo., said he hadn't seen the  
Hastert letter when he decided not to attend the speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's incredibly inappropriate for the House to  
actually offer the invitation,'' he said. ``Didn't we just impeach 
the guy?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tancredo said he thought about having to stand up and applaud  
when the president enters the chamber, and ``I just couldn't do 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Whip Don Nickles, R-Okla., said Senate GOP  
attendance would match that in normal years. ``I figure we will 
have reluctant attendance,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H. originally planned to stay away in  
protest, but changed his mind, said his spokeswoman Karen Hickey. 
``He still doesn't think it's appropriate. But he thought it would 
be best if he attended lest it be perceived as an affront to the 
presidency,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio, said he was going to ``do my very  
best to hear what he has to say and try to forget he's involved in 
this other thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among those not attending was Rep. Bob Barr., R-Ga., one of the  
13 House prosecutors in the Senate impeachment trial. Barr, in a 
statement, said he would watch on television but believed it was 
``inappropriate and awkward for the president to make this speech 
directly to those sitting in judgment of him and those presenting 
the case against him in the Senate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who has  
led the case seeking Clinton's removal from office, also decided 
not to attend. His spokesman, Sam Stratman, said Hyde usually stays 
away because he's not comfortable in large crowds. 
</P>
<P>
	He quoted Hyde as saying he would ``leap to my feet in applause  
in the comfort of my living room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another senior Republican, Rep. John Boehner of Ohio, decided to  
skip the speech, but his spokesman said it had nothing to do with 
the impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Boehner was in Hawaii with his wife celebrating their 25th  
wedding anniversary.

<HEADLINE> Rescuer Saves Life, Loses His Own </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAUNTON, Mass. (AP) -- John Silvia said he was wasn't surprised  
his older brother jumped into an ice-covered pond to save a boy. It 
was something Richard Silvia had done before. 
</P>
<P>
	The man who often rescued his younger brothers when the ice gave  
way under their hockey skates saved the life of a 14-year-old boy 
Monday. But he lost his own. 
</P>
<P>
	``If someone was in dire straits, he would be there,'' John  
Silvia said Tuesday of his older brother, weeping as he placed 
flowers on the spot where rescue workers had tried to resuscitate 
the 39-year-old mental health assistant. ``He would have done it 
for anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As he walked along the train tracks from work, Richard Silvia  
heard a familiar sound coming from the pond where he had played as 
a youngster. A child was calling for help. 
</P>
<P>
	A break in the ice marked the spot where Silvia drowned after  
saving Kevin Vargas from the unnamed pond, one of several in an 
area known as ``The Brickyard'' after a factory torn down decades 
ago. Silvia was under about 10 feet of water for nearly an hour 
before divers found his body. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Kevin and a friend had been horsing around on the  
ice when the boy slipped in. The friend ran for help, bumping into 
Silvia before fetching Kevin's mother. 
</P>
<P>
	She arrived in time to see Silvia push her son to safety. She  
watched as her son unwittingly kicked his rescuer, sending him 
underwater for the last time. She alerted authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ricky's pulled me out of many a pond,'' said John Silvia, 33,  
who had worked as a mental health assistant alongside his brother 
for 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way he went does give me some comfort,'' the brother said,  
staring at the icy glaze on the pond where his brother died. ``He 
gave everything.''

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From Letters on Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from letters written by constituents to Republican  
Sens. John Chafee of Rhode Island and Slade Gorton of Washington: 
</P>
<P>
	To Chafee:  
</P>
<P>
	--''I have voted for you during your last two terms of office and  
am proud to have done so. ... If President Clinton is impeached I 
will not vote for ANY Republican candidates for office for the next 
eight years.'' From the village of Rumford in the city of East 
Providence, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
	--''Senator Chafee, please be not the 'voice of compromise,' nor  
the 'reasonable, bipartisan solution to this ordeal' that Clinton 
has no right to even ask for. Instead be the FIRST voice in the 
Senate to speak loudly and clearly for equal justice under the 
law.'' From an Tiverton independent voter. 
</P>
<P>
	----''I know what I think but what I think is not important. What  
is important is that the Senate does what is best for our 
Constitutional government not just for the present but for all the 
future years to come.'' From Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
	--''I am sickened by President Clinton's behavior. However, I am  
even more deeply offended by the President's impeachment.'' From 
Bristol. 
</P>
<P>
	--''It may hurt us for a while but that is not what the law is  
about. It hurts children when their parents are put in jail for 
doing wrong. It also hurts them when they are taken out of the home 
because of neglect or abuse. ... But we do what is right even if 
people get hurt because the person who commits a crime has to be 
punished.'' From a former Clinton supporter in Warwick. 

</P>
<P>
	To Gorton:  
</P>
<P>
	--''The point of view that all politicians are liars and  
Washington would be a ghost town if all liars were removed is an 
exaggeration (I hope). Or that all men are adulterous, fallible to 
a few trailer camp tramps or stalkers.'' From Bellevue, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	--''Let's cut our losses and lick our national wounds. Let's get  
on with the business of our lives and our nation's business.'' From 
Tacoma. 
</P>
<P>
	--''I listened to all the folderol (some) and it didn't alter my  
opinion of how well he has taken care of governmental affairs. My 
husband and I are seniors, Episcopalian. ... We think he should be 
censured -- with a firm smack on those hands that fondled (Monica 
Lewinsky).'' From Port Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	--''For the good of our children, and our country, we need to  
show severe punishment for his serious misdeeds.'' From Seattle.

<HEADLINE> Bond Funds Offer Broader Choice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Thanks to all the turmoil in the securities  
markets last year, investors in bond mutual funds enjoy a wider 
range of choices than they have seen in quite some time. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the markets went bonkers last summer, there wasn't much  
to distinguish among the various types of bonds. Despite the great 
differences in risk and other characteristics among different bond 
categories, the market was treating them all as members of the 
same, rather dull species. 
</P>
<P>
	But once a serious deflation scare swept through the world's  
financial centers, all that changed. As investors rushed to buy the 
highest-quality bonds and dump everything else, razor-thin yield 
spreads suddenly opened wide. 
</P>
<P>
	As of yearend, noted bond managers at the fund firm of Pioneer  
Investment Management in Boston, yields on mortgage-backed 
securities were about 1.75 percentage points, or 175 basis points, 
above comparable yields on U.S. Treasury securities, marking the 
biggest spread in almost 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``If mortgage prepayments stabilize, this sector would become  
even more attractive,'' said Sherman Russ, co-director of Pioneer's 
U.S. and global fixed-income group. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, he observed, ``intermediate, investment-grade corporate  
bonds offer a 150-basis-point spread over Treasuries, which already 
discounts a considerable slowdown in the economy.'' For lower-rated 
high-yield, or ``junk'' bonds, ``the spread is over 500 basis 
points, more than double equivalent Treasury yields.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The point here is not to recommend any type of bond fund as a  
market-timing opportunity. Wide spreads can always get wider, and 
by themselves they do not necessarily tell you much about which 
type of investment will produce a better absolute return over any 
future period. 
</P>
<P>
	As Sandy Rufenacht, manager of the Janus High-Yield Fund in  
Denver, writes in that fund's annual report, ``Currently, the 
high-yield market appears to be stabilizing ... However, the extent 
to which lower interest rates will help the high-yield market 
depends on whether economic and political conditions calm enough to 
persuade investors to move out of the safety, but reduced yield, of 
Treasury positions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other words, predicting how the markets will behave is a  
chancy business. But even in the midst of that uncertainty, greater 
yield spreads can give you better choices as you decide how to 
allocate your assets. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, high-yield bonds tend to rise and fall with the  
pace of economic activity, behaving a bit like stocks, while 
top-quality bonds move more reflexively up or down in the opposite 
direction from interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	In times when junk bond yields aren't much higher than those of  
higher-quality bonds, investors don't get compensated very well for 
taking the extra risk. But with a wider yield spread, a junk-bond 
fund may make more sense as a kind of compromise between stocks and 
bonds, especially for someone who is worried that the stock market 
might be overvalued. 
</P>
<P>
	As Kenneth Taubes, co-director with Russ in Pioneer's  
bond-management operations, put it: ``This is an asset-allocation 
question rather than a market decision. If an investor already has 
a major allocation to equities and relatively low exposure to cash 
and high-quality fixed income, then high-yield bonds may not be 
appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	``But if the equity allocation is low, high-yield instruments  
should at least be considered. These bonds have already discounted 
a fair amount of slowing in the economy and are trading at 
historically cheap levels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In these high-speed times in the markets, situations that look  
attractive to bond-fund analysts sometimes don't last very long. 
Sheldon Jacobs, who publishes the No-Load Fund Investor newsletter 
in Irivington-on-Hudson, N.Y., issued a recommendation in late 
summer for three funds specializing in the riskiest of all bonds, 
emerging-markets bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We said they would show rewarding gains over a period of  
years,'' Jacobs says. ``Well, the gains came more quickly than 
expected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a jump of about 25 percent in the funds' net asset values  
per share, Jacobs backed off. ``Many issues held in these funds are 
no longer seriously undervalued,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> AFC Title Game Ratings Are Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The AFC championship game between the New York  
Jets and Denver Broncos produced a preliminary rating of 26.6 with 
a 48 share for CBS Sports, the network said on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Each rating point represents 994,000 homes. The share is the  
percentage watching a broadcast among those televisions on at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	The preliminary rating is a six percent increase over NBC's  
rating for last year's AFC title game between Denver and 
Pittsburgh. That game did a 25 rating and 54 share. 
</P>
<P>
	For the season, CBS reported a combined rating of 11.7 and 26  
share for AFC games, an increase of one percent from last year's 
11.6 rating and 27 share. 
</P>
<P>
	A Fox Sports spokesman said that network's ratings for the NFC  
championship game would not be available until Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Worries About Super Bowl Fans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- As the Super Bowl approaches, South Florida could  
have another image problem thanks to two robberies that left a 
Canadian man dead and a prominent Latin American businesswoman 
fighting for her life. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're at the height of the tourist season, with the Super Bowl  
coming,'' Miami-Dade County Manager Merrett Stierheim said. 
``Without question, this is a sensitive time for us. ... We're 
concerned. We've been down this road before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The attacks have rekindled memories of tourist killings in the  
early 1990s as the area gets ready to play host to the Super Bowl 
on Jan. 31 in Pro Player Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Benoit Lessard, 69, a retired truck driver from Quebec, was shot  
through the heart early Sunday by a gunman who may have followed 
him home from Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport to an 
area populated by Canadian snowbirds and retirees. 
</P>
<P>
	He was ambushed one day after wealthy Panamanian Lynn Motta was  
robbed and repeatedly shot at a shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after Lessard was killed, his wife and daughter packed and  
left Miami-Dade County for good. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think they have warm feelings about this area  
anymore,'' said neighbor Kathleen Mendes, who was awakened by the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Stierheim stressed that Miami-Dade County's crime rate has  
improved since 1993, when three German tourists were killed in 
robberies. ``This is not the Miami we saw in 1993,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's tourism industry took two years to recover from the  
effects of 10 tourist-related slayings in 1992 and 1993. Of those 
killings, six were committed in the Miami area. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, the Miami-Dade County created a tourism police  
patrol at Miami International Airport and nearby car rental 
agencies, where much of the crime was occurring. They put up new 
highway signs and created maps to help keep tourists from getting 
lost and venturing into dangerous areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Tourist robberies investigated by the Miami-Dade Police  
Department have dropped significantly since then, falling 86 
percent from 1992 to 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami-Dade police, who were investigating the possibility that  
Lessard and Motta were targeted and stalked, were still searching 
for suspects in both attacks. Detectives said on Tuesday they knew 
the nickname and neighborhood of a suspect in Motta's shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Motta, shot several times, remained in critical condition at  
Jackson Memorial Hospital. Surveillance video from inside the mall 
might show the suspect tailing Motta while she shopped, police 
said. She was shot in the mall's garage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The subject tried to take her purse and she refused to let  
go,'' said Miami-Dade police spokesman detective Rudy Espinosa. 
</P>
<P>
	Tourism officials in Miami-Dade and Broward counties said the  
shootings weren't tourism related, arguing that both victims were

<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Preferences for minorities and women in San  
Francisco city contracts were challenged in court Tuesday by a 
salesman for a white, male-owned contractor that wasn't allowed to 
bid on a city project. 
</P>
<P>
	The Superior Court suit, filed by the Pacific Legal Foundation,  
accuses San Francisco of violating Proposition 209, the 1996 
initiative that prohibited state and local government preferences 
based on race or sex. 
</P>
<P>
	A San Francisco ordinance gives companies owned by minorities or  
women an advantage in bidding for city contracts. Federal courts 
upheld it after city officials presented evidence of longstanding 
race and sex discrimination by the city in contracting fields 
covered by the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
	After the passage of Proposition 209, a lawsuit challenging the  
entire San Francisco ordinance was filed. A ruling in the city's 
favor is now on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest suit, filed Friday, is narrower. It challenges only a  
provision of the ordinance that reserves certain city contracts for 
companies owned by women or minorities if discrimination in a 
particular department has become so rooted that good-faith efforts 
have failed to eliminate it. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit said a white, male-owned company, Ford Graphics, was  
notified by the city last July that it was ineligible to bid on a 
certain project because the project had been classified as a 
``set-aside'' available only to companies owned by minorities, 
women or local residents, another preferred category. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy City Attorney Marc Slavin said the city hadn't seen the  
lawsuit but was confident that its ordinance was valid.

<HEADLINE> UPS To Settle Bias Suit for $12.1 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- In agreeing to settle a racial discrimination  
lawsuit for $12.1 million, United Parcel Service of America Inc. 
said it wanted to show all its employees they would be treated 
fairly by the Atlanta-based company. 
</P>
<P>
	``With this settlement, we are saying that we are making  
absolutely sure that all our employees understand the options that 
they have available to them and that they do have a future with 
this company,'' said Norman Black, spokesman for the express 
carrier and package delivery company. 
</P>
<P>
	Agreement on the suit, originally filed in U.S. District Court  
in San Francisco in April 1997, was reached Friday. A trial date 
had never been scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	Another lawsuit filed by 11 drivers in July 1997, also alleging  
racial discrimination by UPS, is still pending. 
</P>
<P>
	Black said final approval of the April suit must come from the  
court, which he expected would happen sometime in March. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're assuming that the judge will approve it, and there's no  
reason to believe he won't,'' he said. ``It's the final document by 
both sides.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suit alleged that UPS did not adequately inform its black  
part-time workers of procedures and opportunities for advancement, 
said Black. 
</P>
<P>
	James Finberg, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said black  
workers were not being treated as well as whites when it came to 
promotions. 
</P>
<P>
	The major portion of the settlement -- $8.2 million -- will go to  
about 12,000 current and former part-time hourly black workers in 
the company's Northwest and Pacific regions, UPS said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Finberg said the settlement also includes $476,000 to be paid to  
seven black full-time UPS workers, $150,500 to seven part-time 
employees who were the representative plaintiffs on the lawsuit and 
about $3.3 million in lawyers' fees and other costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement also provides that UPS ``will enhance information  
provided to applicants and employees about job opportunities and 
promotion procedures,'' the company said.

<HEADLINE> IMF Defends Its Asian Fiscal Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In its first analysis of the Asian financial  
upheaval,the International Monetary Fund defended itself against 
criticism that some of the austerity measures it required three 
nations to pursue were misguided and worsened the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	While the IMF gave itself a passing grade for handling the  
crisis, the report issued by the 182-nation organization on Tuesday 
did concede that mistakes were made in some areas. 
</P>
<P>
	They included misjudging the severity of the recessions that  
followed adoption of IMF recommendations by Thailand, South Korea 
and Indonesia in exchange for billion-dollar rescue packages. 
</P>
<P>
	But the report places some of the blame for the financial crisis  
on global investors who lent money to these developing nations and 
then rapidly withdrew it at the first sign of trouble. It says ways 
must be found to get the private sector involved in preventing and 
resolving these crises. 
</P>
<P>
	The Asian financial meltdown began in Thailand in July 1997. It  
spread to other countries in the region and then, in 1998, to 
Russia and Latin America -- threatening the global financial system. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil, Latin America's largest economy, received a $41.5  
billion IMF bailout last November. But investors kept pulling their 
money out of the country, leading the government to devalue its 
currency last week and raise interest rates Monday in an attempt to 
calm markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF's sister institution, the World Bank, and several  
prominent economists have argued that it would be better in a 
crisis for countries to let their currencies fall but keep interest 
rates low in an effort to revive the economies as quickly as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Presenting the 149-page report at a news conference, John  
Boorman, the IMF's director of policy development and review 
department, said the Asian crisis ``could have been avoided if 
policies had been implemented differently.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to critics of the IMF's high interest rate  
recommendations, Boorman said they were ``needed at the outset to 
help prevent currencies from going into a downward spiral and we 
believe that has worked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the report shows that Thailand, South Korea and  
Indonesia ``did not raise interest rates soon enough or boldly 
enough to head of a full blown crisis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boorman said the austerity measures the IMF urged on the three  
Asian nations were needed so governments would have the money 
needed for a costly restructuring of their banking systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``That tightening was then put into reverse once it became  
apparent that the recessions these countries faced were going to 
deeper than expected,'' Boorman said, ``and that expansive budget 
policies would be needed to cushion economies in their 
recessions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report includes a summary of views expressed by the IMF's 24  
executive directors when they reviewed the report on Dec. 21. 
Boorman said these directors concluded a central lesson was the 
importance of efforts to involve the private sector early when 
crises develop.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Lays Out Ambitious Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, standing before a Congress  
torn over his fate, proposed Tuesday to protect Social Security 
with the huge budget surpluses that Republicans are eyeing for tax 
cuts. He also announced the government will sue the tobacco 
industry for smokers' health costs. 
</P>
<P>
	On a day of high drama that shifted from his daytime trial in  
the Senate to his prime-time State of the Union speech, Clinton 
made no mention of the sex-and-lies case that led to his 
impeachment and imperils his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the economy booming and the budget balanced, Clinton  
said America's achievements are sometimes overlooked ``in the clash 
of controversy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several Republicans boycotted the 77-minute speech; Chief  
Justice William Rehnquist, presiding over Clinton's trial, also 
stayed away. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, in their response to the president's speech, said  
the nation's business would not be hurt regardless of the outcome 
of Clinton's trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our country is not in crisis,'' said Rep. Jennifer Dunn,  
R-Wash. ``No matter what the outcome of the president's situation, 
life in America will go on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton opened his address by recalling the admonition of new  
House Speaker Dennis Hastert for Republicans and Democrats to work 
in a spirit of bipartisanship. ``Mr. Speaker, let's do exactly 
that,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the ornate House chamber where he was impeached one month ago  
on a party-line vote, the president was received with respect and 
interrupted by applause 95 times. Democrats were most enthusiastic. 
Two of his harshest Republican critics -- House Majority Leader Dick 
Armey of Texas and House Majority Whip Tom DeLay of Texas -- sat 
stonily side by side. 
</P>
<P>
	As Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott left the chamber,  
photographers overheard him asking a companion whether Clinton had 
``no shame.'' Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., a member of the House 
prosecution team, said, ``I think as soon as this trial is over, 
whether it's this president or another president, we will be 
dealing with these (policy) issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Demanding that Washington reserve $4 trillion in expected budget  
surpluses to shore up Social Security and Medicare, Clinton 
declared, ``First things first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a new salvo against smoking, Clinton announced the Justice  
Department will sue the tobacco industry. He also is seeking a 
55-cent-a-pack tax on cigarettes. ``Our children are targets of a 
massive media campaign to hook them on cigarettes,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president also urged spending billions of dollars for new  
programs in child care, education, crime-fighting, the environment 
and the Pentagon. And he called for raising the minimum wage by $1 
an hour over two years to $6.15. 
</P>
<P>
	``With our budget surplus growing, our economy expanding, our  
confidence rising, now is the time for this generation to meet our 
historic responsibility to the 21st century,'' Clinton said. 
``Let's get to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's speech came eight hours after White House lawyers  
began defending the president in a Senate trial, arguing he was 
innocent of perjury and obstruction of justice charges and ``must 
not be removed from office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two special guests sat in the House chamber with first lady  
Hillary Rodham Clinton as the president spoke: civil rights pioneer 
Rosa Parks and baseball slugger Sammy Sosa. Clinton singled out his 
wife, saying ``I honor her'' for her work with children and on 
behalf of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	On education, the president said he would send Congress a plan  
that for the first time holds states and school districts 
accountable for their progress and rewards them for results, he 
said. Schools that fail to comply could lose some of the $15 
billion the federal government spends on education. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe we must change the way we invest that money, to  
support what works and to stop supporting what doesn't,'' the 
president said. No child should graduate from high school ``with a 
diploma he or she can't read,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	In his remarks on foreign policy, Clinton said the United States  
will continue to contain Iraq's Saddam Hussein. ``And we will work 
for the day when Iraq has a government worthy of its people,'' 
Clinton said. In the aftermath of the killing of more than 40 
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, Clinton said the United States and NATO 
allies ``are pressing the Serbian government to stop its brutal 
repression in Kosovo, to bring those responsible to justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also proposed $4.2 billion -- a 70 percent increase -- to  
dismantle and destroy Russia's nuclear arsenal and redirect the 
work of Russian scientists from weapons to civilian research. 
</P>
<P>
	On Social Security, Clinton's proposal sets up a monumental  
fight over how to protect the giant retirement program and deal 
with GOP tax-cutting ambitions against a background of $4 trillion 
in projected surpluses over 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's plan would create new 401(k)-style retirement  
accounts for workers and invest some of Social Security's cash 
reserves in the stock market for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	In sharp contrast, Lott called for a 10 percent across-the-board  
tax cut. Republicans also attacked the idea of having the 
government invest Social Security cash on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, no, a thousand times no,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas,  
House Ways and Means chairman. ``If you thought a government 
takeover of health care was bad, just wait until the government 
becomes an owner of America's private sector companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton proposed transferring about 60 percent of expected  
budget surpluses over the next 15 years -- $2.7 trillion -- to the 
Social Security account to keep the program solvent until 2055. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-five percent of that money would be invested by the  
government in the stock market in hopes of achieving higher 
returns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I reach out my hand to those of you of both parties in both  
houses and ask you to join me in saying we will save Social 
Security now,'' Clinton said. ``Last year, we wisely reserved all 
of the surplus until we knew what it would take to save Social 
Security. Again, I say, we should not spend any of it until after 
Social Security is truly saved. 
</P>
<P>
	``First things first.''  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's plan also would reserve 15 percent of the surplus --  
$650 billion over 15 years -- for the ailing Medicare system. An 
additional 11 percent of the surplus -- $500 billion -- would be 
devoted to new government-subsidized retirement accounts, with the 
Treasury matching the savings of lower-income people. The rest of 
the surplus would go for military spending and domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Never before has a president delivered a State of the Union  
address under such extraordinary conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's House accusers and Senate judges were the immediate  
audience, although his real target was millions of Americans 
watching at home. His job was to convince them he is faithful to 
their interests and should remain in power.

<HEADLINE>  Scottie Pippen To Play for Rockets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Keep the door open, the exodus from the Chicago  
Bulls is picking up speed. 
</P>
<P>
	With Michael Jordan trading in his gym shoes for golf spikes,  
the Bulls are wasting little time in breaking up the six-time 
champions. Scottie Pippen will be traded to the Houston Rockets, 
with Steve Kerr and Luc Longley following him out the door. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls will sign Pippen to a five-year, $67.2 million deal --  
with an additional $15 million in incentives -- and then promptly 
ship him to the Rockets. In return, Chicago will get forward Roy 
Rogers and a second-round draft pick, said numerous league sources 
who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am excited about my new career in Houston, and even though  
everything seems to be changing, I hope Bulls fans everywhere will 
understand that it is time for a new era to begin in Chicago,'' 
Pippen said Monday night in a statement released by his agent, 
Jimmy Sexton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chicago has been my home for nearly half my life, and with  
family and friends here I will always treat the city as home. I 
only hope the city of Chicago will continue to treat me as one of 
their own. Thanks for all the great memories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kerr, one of the best 3-point shooters in the league, will sign  
a five-year, $11 million deal with the San Antonio Spurs, according 
to a source close to the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	And Longley, the starting center on the Bulls' last three  
championship teams, was reportedly headed to the Phoenix Suns. 
According to newspaper reports, Longley will sign a five-year, $30 
million deal with the Bulls, who will then trade him to Phoenix for 
forward Martin Muursepp, forward-center Mark Bryant and 
guard-forward Bubba Wells. 
</P>
<P>
	The departures of Pippen, Kerr and Longley are only part of the  
bad news for Bulls fans. Free agent Antonio McDyess has crossed the 
Bulls off his list of potential suitors because he wants to play 
for a winner, his agent said. 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix and Denver are now the front-runners in the McDyess  
sweepstakes, James Bryant told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``Houston and Chicago are out of the picture,'' Bryant said.  
``Tony has analyzed the situation carefully, and he's most at home 
with those two options: Phoenix is going to stay a winner and 
Denver is going to be a winner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bulls general manager Jerry Krause is keeping silent while he  
wheels and deals, but he said last week the Bulls had three 
options. If Jordan stayed, Chicago would try and bring back the 
championship team. If he left, the Bulls would try and sign their 
own key free agents and make a run at some of the others available. 
</P>
<P>
	And if those plans failed, the Bulls will rebuild completely.  
Chicago is still interested in free agent Brent Barry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jerry is going to target key free agents in terms of being as  
competitive as we can this year,'' new coach Tim Floyd said. ``If 
we are unable to get those guys, he will remain vigilant in his 
plans to bring it back to the level where it's been. But that could 
be a process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judging by the Pippen deal, it's going to be. Although the  
salaries for Pippen and Rogers do not match, the deal is allowable 
under NBA rules because Houston will have enough salary cap room to 
fit in Pippen's contract. His salary for this season will be $10.6 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal won't be finalized until the lockout ends Wednesday or  
Thursday. He should be in uniform for the Rockets when they play an 
exhibition game against San Antonio on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to confirm anything,'' Rockets spokesman Tim  
Frank said. ``The lockout is technically not over. We're still 
under lockout restrictions. No deal can officially be done until 
that cloak is lifted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen, a six-time champion with the Bulls, is considered one of  
the top three free agents up for grabs as NBA teams prepare to open 
training camps delayed by the 6 1/2-month lockout. The seven-time 
All-Star forward had talked to the Rockets about signing with them 
as a free agent, and it wasn't immediately clear why he agreed to a 
sign-and-trade deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition of Pippen should clear the way for Charles  
Barkley to re-sign with Houston, giving the Rockets a formidable 
front line of Barkley, Pippen and Hakeem Olajuwon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to thank the Chicago Bulls, the great people of  
the city of Chicago and all my teammates for 11 wonderful 
seasons,'' Pippen said. ``I would also like to personally thank the 
Bulls for helping me through this period of free agency. I wish 
them the best, because that is what Chicago deserves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 33-year-old Pippen has been with Chicago since the 1987-88  
season when he was drafted out of Central Arkansas. Last season, he 
averaged 19.1 points and 5.2 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the Bulls, they have four players under contract and will  
have only a handful of practices before playing the Indiana Pacers 
on Sunday in an exhibition game. Those would be the same Pacers who 
have been practicing together throughout the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	``I may have to have a roster in my hands to figure who is out  
there, and that isn't great,'' Floyd said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody can envision the days of playing sandlot  
football and drawing plays in the dirt. We could actually be moving 
Gatorade bottles around the sideline for the game Sunday.''

<HEADLINE>  Broncos' Defense Gives No Ground </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The Denver Broncos have the kind of stingy run  
defense that wins championships. 
</P>
<P>
	In two straight playoff games, the Broncos have smothered the  
opposition's running attack, holding the Miami Dolphins and New 
York Jets to identically minuscule totals: 14 yards on 13 carries. 
</P>
<P>
	If they can summon a third effort of that magnitude against the  
Atlanta Falcons on Jan. 31 he Broncos probably can start sizing 
their second straight Super Bowl championship rings. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the playoffs, the name of the game is running the  
football,'' Broncos defensive coordinator Greg Robinson said. ``If 
you can't run, it makes life harder on the quarterback. The team 
that can control the football usually wins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an AFC divisional playoff game on Jan. 9, the Broncos shut  
down Karim Abdul-Jabbar and the Miami running attack, forcing Dan 
Marino to try to win the game by himself. Marino was not up to the 
task, and Denver rolled 38-3. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sunday's AFC championship game, Curtis Martin and his Jets  
teammates were similarly stuffed. Even though Vinny Testaverde 
threw for 356 yards, he was intercepted twice. 
</P>
<P>
	In their last four games, in fact, the Broncos have been superb  
against the run, yielding a combined 88 yards on 67 carries, an 
average of only 1.3 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver's defense mounted a similar late-season surge a year ago.  
For most of the 1997 season, Denver struggled against the run and 
finished a mediocre 16th in the NFL, allowing 112.7 yards per game. 
They yielded 4.7 yards per carry, the highest ever for a Super Bowl 
champion, but tightened their run defense in the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, they improved to No. 3 in the NFL, allowing 80.4  
yards per game and 3.6 yards per carry, but have been even better 
the last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have veteran leadership,'' defensive end Neil Smith said  
Tuesday, ``and I think we just know when it's time to turn it on 
late in the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 31, the Broncos will try to turn it on again against  
Atlanta's Jamal Anderson, who finished second in the NFL to 
Denver's Terrell Davis with 1,846 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos believe the powerful, 234-pound Anderson, who  
carried an NFL-record 410 times during the regular season, presents 
one of their toughest challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anderson is a runner who will rip your arms right out of the  
sockets if you don't wrap him up,'' defensive tackle Trevor Pryce 
said. ``From what I've seen, you don't arm-tackle that guy. You 
have to get a lot of people around him and force him to run 
laterally if you can. It's going to be one of our biggest 
challenges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos also were worried about Martin, who ran for 1,287  
yards this season, but they quickly neutralized him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Curtis Martin is a great cutback runner,'' Robinson said.  
``He's been the difference in a lot of their ballgames, but our 
guys were determined he wasn't going to be the difference in this 
last one. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did a great job against the run, but we've got another  
great runner coming up. We've got work to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker Glenn Cadrez said stopping the run ``is something we  
have a lot of confidence in because it's something we've done all 
year. The way we've been playing, teams have to throw the ball 50 
times and complete about 40 of them, because they're not going to 
beat us on the ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker Bill Romanowski, who had a game-high 11 tackles  
against the Jets despite suffering a concussion, said discipline 
has been a key to Denver's defensive resurgence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody has been very disciplined in what they do,'' he  
said. ``It's been 11 guys flying to the ball. The discipline and 
the guys making plays is the reason we've been fortunate enough to 
stop the run, which sets everything up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, who now has just 101 yards rushing in four career games  
against Denver, said, ``There was a man matched up on me everywhere 
I went. They pursued the ball really well and they wrapped up. They 
didn't just hit, they made tackles.''

<HEADLINE>  Scottie Pippen To Play for Rockets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Keep the door open, the exodus from the Chicago  
Bulls is picking up speed. 
</P>
<P>
	With Michael Jordan trading in his gym shoes for golf spikes,  
the Bulls are wasting little time in breaking up the six-time 
champions. Scottie Pippen will be traded to the Houston Rockets, 
with Steve Kerr and Luc Longley following him out the door. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls will sign Pippen to a five-year, $67.2 million deal --  
with an additional $15 million in incentives -- and then promptly 
ship him to the Rockets. In return, Chicago will get forward Roy 
Rogers and a second-round draft pick, said numerous league sources 
who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am excited about my new career in Houston, and even though  
everything seems to be changing, I hope Bulls fans everywhere will 
understand that it is time for a new era to begin in Chicago,'' 
Pippen said Monday night in a statement released by his agent, 
Jimmy Sexton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chicago has been my home for nearly half my life, and with  
family and friends here I will always treat the city as home. I 
only hope the city of Chicago will continue to treat me as one of 
their own. Thanks for all the great memories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kerr, one of the best 3-point shooters in the league, will sign  
a five-year, $11 million deal with the San Antonio Spurs, according 
to a source close to the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	And Longley, the starting center on the Bulls' last three  
championship teams, was reportedly headed to the Phoenix Suns. 
According to newspaper reports, Longley will sign a five-year, $30 
million deal with the Bulls, who will then trade him to Phoenix for 
forward Martin Muursepp, forward-center Mark Bryant and 
guard-forward Bubba Wells. 
</P>
<P>
	The departures of Pippen, Kerr and Longley are only part of the  
bad news for Bulls fans. Free agent Antonio McDyess has crossed the 
Bulls off his list of potential suitors because he wants to play 
for a winner, his agent said. 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix and Denver are now the front-runners in the McDyess  
sweepstakes, James Bryant told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``Houston and Chicago are out of the picture,'' Bryant said.  
``Tony has analyzed the situation carefully, and he's most at home 
with those two options: Phoenix is going to stay a winner and 
Denver is going to be a winner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bulls general manager Jerry Krause is keeping silent while he  
wheels and deals, but he said last week the Bulls had three 
options. If Jordan stayed, Chicago would try and bring back the 
championship team. If he left, the Bulls would try and sign their 
own key free agents and make a run at some of the others available. 
</P>
<P>
	And if those plans failed, the Bulls will rebuild completely.  
Chicago is still interested in free agent Brent Barry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jerry is going to target key free agents in terms of being as  
competitive as we can this year,'' new coach Tim Floyd said. ``If 
we are unable to get those guys, he will remain vigilant in his 
plans to bring it back to the level where it's been. But that could 
be a process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judging by the Pippen deal, it's going to be. Although the  
salaries for Pippen and Rogers do not match, the deal is allowable 
under NBA rules because Houston will have enough salary cap room to 
fit in Pippen's contract. His salary for this season will be $10.6 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal won't be finalized until the lockout ends Wednesday or  
Thursday. He should be in uniform for the Rockets when they play an 
exhibition game against San Antonio on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to confirm anything,'' Rockets spokesman Tim  
Frank said. ``The lockout is technically not over. We're still 
under lockout restrictions. No deal can officially be done until 
that cloak is lifted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen, a six-time champion with the Bulls, is considered one of  
the top three free agents up for grabs as NBA teams prepare to open 
training camps delayed by the 6 1/2-month lockout. The seven-time 
All-Star forward had talked to the Rockets about signing with them 
as a free agent, and it wasn't immediately clear why he agreed to a 
sign-and-trade deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition of Pippen should clear the way for Charles  
Barkley to re-sign with Houston, giving the Rockets a formidable 
front line of Barkley, Pippen and Hakeem Olajuwon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to thank the Chicago Bulls, the great people of  
the city of Chicago and all my teammates for 11 wonderful 
seasons,'' Pippen said. ``I would also like to personally thank the 
Bulls for helping me through this period of free agency. I wish 
them the best, because that is what Chicago deserves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 33-year-old Pippen has been with Chicago since the 1987-88  
season when he was drafted out of Central Arkansas. Last season, he 
averaged 19.1 points and 5.2 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the Bulls, they have four players under contract and will  
have only a handful of practices before playing the Indiana Pacers 
on Sunday in an exhibition game. Those would be the same Pacers who 
have been practicing together throughout the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	``I may have to have a roster in my hands to figure who is out  
there, and that isn't great,'' Floyd said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody can envision the days of playing sandlot  
football and drawing plays in the dirt. We could actually be moving 
Gatorade bottles around the sideline for the game Sunday.''

<HEADLINE> Cargill Profits Widen in First Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Cargill Inc., which sustained heavy losses on  
financial trading in Russia and emerging markets, still managed to 
widen earnings during the first half of its fiscal year by selling 
its international seed business. 
</P>
<P>
	Cargill, which sold the seed business to Monsanto Co. for $1.4  
billion, on Tuesday reported earnings of $587 million for the six 
months ended Nov. 30, compared to $124 million in the same period a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Cargill, one of the world's largest privately owned companies,  
was hard hit in the period by Russia's devaluation of the ruble and 
the country's failure to make payments on foreign debts. The 
company did not release the size of its operating loss for the 
first half of the year but has previously said it was significant. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it has since reduced the size and scope of its  
financial operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Several of our commodity trading and food processing  
businesses performed well in the first six months of fiscal 1999,'' 
said Cargill Vice Chairman Robert Lumpkins. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some, however, were hurt by the prolonged economic slowdown in  
Asia and other emerging markets that weakened demand for 
agricultural products just as back-to-back big harvests boosted 
supplies,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lumpkins said Cargill's balance sheet and cash flow remain  
strong, and the company is moving ahead with the agreement 
announced in November to acquire the global grain business of 
Continental Grain Co. 
</P>
<P>
	That deal will be the subject of a Jan. 26 hearing in the U.S.  
Senate. Several senators called for a congressional review after 
the nation's two largest grain companies announced their plans to 
merge. 
</P>
<P>
	Cargill, with about 80,600 employees, sells, processes and  
distributes agricultural, financial and industrial products in 65 
countries and has business activities in 130 additional countries.

<HEADLINE>  Broncos' Defense Gives No Ground </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The Denver Broncos have the kind of stingy run  
defense that wins championships. 
</P>
<P>
	In two straight playoff games, the Broncos have smothered the  
opposition's running attack, holding the Miami Dolphins and New 
York Jets to identically minuscule totals: 14 yards on 13 carries. 
</P>
<P>
	If they can summon a third effort of that magnitude against the  
Atlanta Falcons on Jan. 31 he Broncos probably can start sizing 
their second straight Super Bowl championship rings. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the playoffs, the name of the game is running the  
football,'' Broncos defensive coordinator Greg Robinson said. ``If 
you can't run, it makes life harder on the quarterback. The team 
that can control the football usually wins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an AFC divisional playoff game on Jan. 9, the Broncos shut  
down Karim Abdul-Jabbar and the Miami running attack, forcing Dan 
Marino to try to win the game by himself. Marino was not up to the 
task, and Denver rolled 38-3. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sunday's AFC championship game, Curtis Martin and his Jets  
teammates were similarly stuffed. Even though Vinny Testaverde 
threw for 356 yards, he was intercepted twice. 
</P>
<P>
	In their last four games, in fact, the Broncos have been superb  
against the run, yielding a combined 88 yards on 67 carries, an 
average of only 1.3 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver's defense mounted a similar late-season surge a year ago.  
For most of the 1997 season, Denver struggled against the run and 
finished a mediocre 16th in the NFL, allowing 112.7 yards per game. 
They yielded 4.7 yards per carry, the highest ever for a Super Bowl 
champion, but tightened their run defense in the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, they improved to No. 3 in the NFL, allowing 80.4  
yards per game and 3.6 yards per carry, but have been even better 
the last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have veteran leadership,'' defensive end Neil Smith said  
Tuesday, ``and I think we just know when it's time to turn it on 
late in the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 31, the Broncos will try to turn it on again against  
Atlanta's Jamal Anderson, who finished second in the NFL to 
Denver's Terrell Davis with 1,846 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos believe the powerful, 234-pound Anderson, who  
carried an NFL-record 410 times during the regular season, presents 
one of their toughest challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anderson is a runner who will rip your arms right out of the  
sockets if you don't wrap him up,'' defensive tackle Trevor Pryce 
said. ``From what I've seen, you don't arm-tackle that guy. You 
have to get a lot of people around him and force him to run 
laterally if you can. It's going to be one of our biggest 
challenges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos also were worried about Martin, who ran for 1,287  
yards this season, but they quickly neutralized him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Curtis Martin is a great cutback runner,'' Robinson said.  
``He's been the difference in a lot of their ballgames, but our 
guys were determined he wasn't going to be the difference in this 
last one. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did a great job against the run, but we've got another  
great runner coming up. We've got work to do.'' 
</P>

have a lot of confidence in because it's something we've done all

times and complete about 40 of them, because they're not going to 
beat us on the ground.''

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Lays Out Ambitious Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, standing before a Congress  
torn over his fate, proposed Tuesday to protect Social Security 
with the huge budget surpluses that Republicans are eyeing for tax 
cuts. He also announced the government will sue the tobacco 
industry for smokers' health costs. 
</P>
<P>
	On a day of high drama that shifted from his daytime trial in  
the Senate to his prime-time State of the Union speech, Clinton 
made no mention of the sex-and-lies case that led to his 
impeachment and imperils his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the economy booming and the budget balanced, Clinton  
said America's achievements are sometimes overlooked ``in the clash 
of controversy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several Republicans boycotted the 77-minute speech; Chief  
Justice William Rehnquist, presiding over Clinton's trial, also 
stayed away. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, in their response to the president's speech, said  
the nation's business would not be hurt regardless of the outcome 
of Clinton's trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our country is not in crisis,'' said Rep. Jennifer Dunn,  
R-Wash. ``No matter what the outcome of the president's situation, 
life in America will go on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton opened his address by recalling the admonition of new  
House Speaker Dennis Hastert for Republicans and Democrats to work 
in a spirit of bipartisanship. ``Mr. Speaker, let's do exactly 
that,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the ornate House chamber where he was impeached one month ago  
on a party-line vote, the president was received with respect and 
interrupted by applause 95 times. Democrats were most enthusiastic. 
Two of his harshest Republican critics -- House Majority Leader Dick 
Armey of Texas and House Majority Whip Tom DeLay of Texas -- sat 
stonily side by side. 
</P>
<P>
	As Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott left the chamber,  
photographers overheard him asking a companion whether Clinton had 
``no shame.'' Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., a member of the House 
prosecution team, said, ``I think as soon as this trial is over, 
whether it's this president or another president, we will be 
dealing with these (policy) issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Demanding that Washington reserve $4 trillion in expected budget  
surpluses to shore up Social Security and Medicare, Clinton 
declared, ``First things first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a new salvo against smoking, Clinton announced the Justice  
Department will sue the tobacco industry. He also is seeking a 
55-cent-a-pack tax on cigarettes. ``Our children are targets of a 
massive media campaign to hook them on cigarettes,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president also urged spending billions of dollars for new  
programs in child care, education, crime-fighting, the environment 
and the Pentagon. And he called for raising the minimum wage by $1 
an hour over two years to $6.15. 
</P>
<P>
	``With our budget surplus growing, our economy expanding, our  
confidence rising, now is the time for this generation to meet our 
historic responsibility to the 21st century,'' Clinton said. 
``Let's get to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's speech came eight hours after White House lawyers  
began defending the president in a Senate trial, arguing he was 
innocent of perjury and obstruction of justice charges and ``must 
not be removed from office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two special guests sat in the House chamber with first lady  
Hillary Rodham Clinton as the president spoke: civil rights pioneer 
Rosa Parks and baseball slugger Sammy Sosa. Clinton singled out his 
wife, saying ``I honor her'' for her work with children and on 
behalf of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	On education, the president said he would send Congress a plan  
that for the first time holds states and school districts 
accountable for their progress and rewards them for results, he 
said. Schools that fail to comply could lose some of the $15 
billion the federal government spends on education. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe we must change the way we invest that money, to  
support what works and to stop supporting what doesn't,'' the 
president said. No child should graduate from high school ``with a 
diploma he or she can't read,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	In his remarks on foreign policy, Clinton said the United States  
will continue to contain Iraq's Saddam Hussein. ``And we will work 
for the day when Iraq has a government worthy of its people,'' 
Clinton said. In the aftermath of the killing of more than 40 
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, Clinton said the United States and NATO 
allies ``are pressing the Serbian government to stop its brutal 
repression in Kosovo, to bring those responsible to justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also proposed $4.2 billion -- a 70 percent increase -- to  
dismantle and destroy Russia's nuclear arsenal and redirect the 
work of Russian scientists from weapons to civilian research. 
</P>
<P>
	On Social Security, Clinton's proposal sets up a monumental  
fight over how to protect the giant retirement program and deal 
with GOP tax-cutting ambitions against a background of $4 trillion 
in projected surpluses over 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's plan would create new 401(k)-style retirement  
accounts for workers and invest some of Social Security's cash 
reserves in the stock market for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	In sharp contrast, Lott called for a 10 percent across-the-board  
tax cut. Republicans also attacked the idea of having the 
government invest Social Security cash on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, no, a thousand times no,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas,  
House Ways and Means chairman. ``If you thought a government 
takeover of health care was bad, just wait until the government 
becomes an owner of America's private sector companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton proposed transferring about 60 percent of expected  
budget surpluses over the next 15 years -- $2.7 trillion -- to the 
Social Security account to keep the program solvent until 2055. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-five percent of that money would be invested by the  
government in the stock market in hopes of achieving higher 
returns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I reach out my hand to those of you of both parties in both  
houses and ask you to join me in saying we will save Social 
Security now,'' Clinton said. ``Last year, we wisely reserved all 
of the surplus until we knew what it would take to save Social 
Security. Again, I say, we should not spend any of it until after 
Social Security is truly saved. 
</P>
<P>
	``First things first.''  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's plan also would reserve 15 percent of the surplus --  
$650 billion over 15 years -- for the ailing Medicare system. An 
additional 11 percent of the surplus -- $500 billion -- would be 
devoted to new government-subsidized retirement accounts, with the 
Treasury matching the savings of lower-income people. The rest of 
the surplus would go for military spending and domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Never before has a president delivered a State of the Union  
address under such extraordinary conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's House accusers and Senate judges were the immediate  
audience, although his real target was millions of Americans 
watching at home. His job was to convince them he is faithful to 
their interests and should remain in power.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls Against Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen Tuesday as  
dealers took profits on the dollar's recent rise and as higher 
yields on Japanese government bonds helped bolster the yen. The 
dollar was barely changed against the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar fell to 113.49 yen in late New York trading, down  
from 114.35 late Monday when trading was light because of the 
Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday. The euro was quoted at $1.1614, 
barely rising from $1.1601 late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar initially rose Tuesday against the yen and euro,  
largely on the wings of Brazil's decision Monday to float its 
currency, which many see as an important step toward curing that 
country's financial ills. 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan, the yen gained strength from rising interest rates.  
The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 
1.865 percent from 1.725 percent Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's certainly something people are eyeing,'' said David  
Gilmore, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics in Essex, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was also hit by profit-taking following its rise over  
the past week. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was profit-taking after a pretty good run since ... last  
week,'' said Henry Willmore, a senior economist at Barclays 
Capital. 
</P>
<P>
	But traders remained cautious and didn't make any major moves  
ahead of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's testimony before 
Congress Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In other markets, the dollar was quoted at 1.3753 Swiss francs,  
down from 1.3811 Monday, and 1.5306 Canadian dollars, up from 
1.5283. The British pound rose to $1.6554 from $1.6529. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Monday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.6841 German 
marks, down from 1.6861; 5.6465 French francs, down from 5.6529; 
and 1,666.67 Italian lire, down from 1,669.45.

<HEADLINE> Jones' Team Decries 1st Legal Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Paula Jones' lawyers say her first  
legal team, which won a key round in her sexual harassment case at 
the U.S. Supreme Court, isn't entitled to any share of her $850,000 
settlement with President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas law firm of Rader, Campbell, Fisher &AMP; Pyke said in  
court papers filed Tuesday that Joseph Cammarata and Gilbert Davis' 
work was ``riddled with malpractice'' and that they abandoned her 
case because they lacked ``professional ability'' and ``personal 
resolve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cammarata and Davis said they were offended by the claim and  
that they left the case after Mrs. Jones refused their advice to 
accept a settlement offer that included $700,000 and a vague 
apology. They say they are owed $875,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything we touched, we won,'' Davis said. ``Everything they  
touched, they lost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cammarata added: ``It's a cheap attack on us to enrich  
themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones claims Clinton propositioned her May 8, 1991, at the  
Excelsior Hotel in Little Rock, when he was Arkansas governor and 
she was a state worker. Clinton has denied the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
	She sued Clinton in 1994. Although a federal judge in Little  
Rock ruled that any trial could wait until Clinton left office, the 
U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously in 1997 that the president had 
no right to such a delay. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Sugar, Coffee, Grains, Soybeans Fall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Sugar, coffee, grain and soybean futures suffered broad losses  
Tuesday on U.S. futures exchanges as investors worried Brazil's 
currency crisis will extend to Latin America and possibly to the 
United States, further dimming the world export picture. 
</P>
<P>
	Sugar futures tumbled nearly 9 percent, for its biggest one-day  
loss in more than three years on the Board of Trade of the City of 
New York as producer selling from Brazil, the world's largest sugar 
producer, confirmed fears that that country's currency devaluation 
would result in a flood of exports from people seeking hard cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Most commodities are priced in U.S. dollars, which means  
Brazilian marketers would be able to boost exports and receive more 
of their own currency, the real. 
</P>
<P>
	Sugar futures prices have been plagued for months by ample world  
supplies and reduced demand, and the Brazilian situation appears to 
have accelerated the slide in prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Raw sugar for March delivery tumbled 0.73 cent to 7.69 a pound,  
the lowest active-contract price since Dec. 28 and the biggest 
one-day loss since October 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee futures also tumbled on fears of increased selling from  
Brazil, which is the world's largest coffee exporter and recently 
harvested its largest crop in 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Further depressed prices was a report released late Friday from  
industry trade group the Green Coffee Association, which said U.S. 
inventories rose a sharp 140,000 bags weighing 145 pounds each. 
That puts inventories at a healthy 1.408 million bags, at a time 
when the peak consumption period is winding down. 
</P>
<P>
	With Central American supplies still pouring in after late  
harvests, analysts expect U.S. inventories to rise even more 
sharply in coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	March arabica coffee fell 9 cents, or 8 percent, to $1.066 a  
pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Grain and soybean futures prices also fell sharply, on the  
Chicago Board of Trade, amid perceptions world demand for U.S. 
products will remain weak in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybean futures initially fell as beneficial weekend  
rains increased the likelihood that Argentina and Brazil will bring 
in largest harvests, at a time when a global economic crisis has 
rocked American export business. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures retreated on news that Egypt, one of the largest  
purchasers of American wheat, had tendered for only one U.S. cargo 
over the weekend, instead choosing to buy competing crops from 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Futures prices across the board also faced continued pressure  
from concerns Brazil's economic crisis will spread to other Latin 
American nations, reducing what scant demand U.S. farmers have been 
relying on in the face of currency troubles in Asia and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	March wheat fell 8 1/2 cents to $2.68 1/2 a bushel; March corn fell 1 3/4  
cents to $2.13 3/4 a bushel; March oats fell 2 cents to $1.05 3/4 a 
bushel; March soybeans fell 7 1/4 cents to $5.25 a bushel.

<HEADLINE>  Brazil Stocks Up Despite Rate Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- Brazilian stocks were higher today  
despite a spike in interbank lending rates to 32 percent following 
the government announcement that it would float its currency on a 
long-term basis. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank raised its overnight interbank lending rate  
from 29.80 percent in what some analysts said was a bid to 
discourage inflation and an outflow of investment from Latin 
America's largest economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices on the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange slipped early on  
the news but later were up 3.9 percent. The rise followed gains on 
Friday and Monday in the wake of the government's decision to stop 
spending hard currency to shore up its overvalued currency, the 
real. 
</P>
<P>
	The real weakened today, trading at 1.60 to the dollar compared  
to Monday's close of 1.59 percent. The currency has tumbled 24 
percent since the government began a series of steps to devalue it. 
</P>
<P>
	The government now must take the painful measures of cutting its  
swollen budget deficit and raising taxes if it is to preserve 
investor confidence and win additional foreign financial aid -- two 
elements seen as crucial in the effort to save Brazil's economy. 
</P>
<P>
	To do so, however, the government must push reforms through an  
independent-minded and often cantankerous Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brazil has already won,'' declared President Fernando Henrique  
Cardoso, speaking at a news conference with the leaders of both 
houses of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet many analysts think it too early to claim victory.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think that Brazil has still got to do a lot of homework on  
the fiscal front,'' said Mauro Schneider, chief economist at ING 
Barings in Sao Paulo. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States fears that if Brazil suffers an Asian-style  
currency crisis, its economy could hurt other countries in the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
	Nose-diving currencies and a loss of investor confidence could  
cause a regional economic contraction, which in turn would affect 
U.S. exports and hurt the U.S. economy, which has about 2,000 
American multinationals doing business in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's finance minister, Pedro Malan -- eager to win another  
installment of a $41 billion emergency loan package -- was in 
Washington to explain to the Clinton administration, the 
International Monetary Fund and investors how his government will 
make its promised reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardoso, meanwhile, defended his government's move to end once  
and for all its expensive four-year defense of the real's value, 
saying the shift to a floating currency was a necessary first step 
to turning around the economy in this nation of 165 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	Global stock markets rallied after Brazil permanently floated  
its currency and sought to assure the rest of the world that it 
will drive ahead with further tough reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil has received around $9 billion of the IMF-led rescue  
package and is now seeking the release of another $9 billion 
installment. 
</P>
<P>
	But the IMF is requiring that Cardoso's government first raise  
taxes and cut spending to reduce its public deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	This, however, is meeting vocal opposition from state governors  
who claim they lack the means to pay their multibillion-dollar 
debts to the federal government.

<HEADLINE> Will Stroh's Be Toasting the Millennium? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The Stroh family has sold beer in Detroit since  
1850. But industry experts are wondering if a company full of 
19th-century tradition will toast the new millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stroh Brewery Co. has been struggling with declining sales,  
a loss of contract business, increased competition and heavy debt. 
And that has fueled industry speculation the company would be sold 
to Pabst Brewing Co. and its assets split between Pabst and Miller 
Brewing Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not going to be able to turn it around without  
exploring strategic alternatives -- merging or divesting,'' said 
Skip Carpenter, an analyst with Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette 
Securities Corp. Stroh ``clearly will not be a long-term survivor 
if they remain in their current situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials strongly disagree with such forecasts, noting  
that past predictions of doom haven't come true. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Stroh Brewery Company has for some time predicted that  
there would be further consolidation in the industry,'' said 
spokeswoman Lacey Logan. ``However, there has never been a 
timetable for this to occur. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stroh has the wherewithal to go it alone and will take  
necessary steps to remain competitive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What can't be denied, however, is that 1998 was a bitter year.  
</P>
<P>
	Stroh's shipments declined 15 percent through the third quarter,  
a drop of 1.9 million barrels, according to Benj Steinman, 
president of Beer Marketer's Insights, a trade newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the worsening of a trend,'' he said. ``They've been down  
any number of years, but that's the steepest drop so far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinman says part of the problem was lower sales due to  
increased competition beginning in 1997. Brewers of higher-priced 
brands lowered their prices, hurting companies like Stroh, which 
sells lower-end brands like Colt 45 and Old Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also was hurt by Pabst's decision to switch its  
contract brewing from Stroh to Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, Stroh announced it was closing its brewery in  
Tampa, Fla., laying off more than 150 people there, to cut 
capacity. It also said it was cutting jobs in its Detroit 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Stroh is still a family-owned company, and doesn't have to  
release financial disclosure forms. But according to the Milwaukee 
Journal Sentinel, the company squeezed out a profit on operations 
in the third quarter of 1998 due to cost-cutting, but lost money 
for the year due to heavy debt payments. Stroh increased its debt 
load after the 1996 purchase of La Crosse, Wis.-based G. Heileman 
Brewing Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The company employs about 3,000 nationwide. It has breweries in  
Texas, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Washington and 
Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
	It's among the last of a host of brewing concerns founded by  
German immigrant families. 
</P>
<P>
	When Bernard Stroh stepped off the docks in Detroit in 1850, his  
family already had been brewing beer for two generations in 
Germany. In Detroit, he cooked up some beer in a small barrel and 
started delivering it in a wheelbarrow. The brew found a market in 
an area where darker, English-style beers had predominated. 
</P>
<P>
	By the turn of the century, there were 23 breweries in Detroit,  
and The Stroh Brewing Co. was the largest. It was pouring out 
50,000 barrels a year. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1950, the company was brewing 300,000 barrels a year. For a  
couple of decades, Stroh was satisfied with being a regional 
player. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1980, then-president Peter Stroh decided to grow. In 1978,  
his company rolled out Stroh's Light -- the first new brand in the 
company's history. It bought the F&AMP;M Schafer Brewing Co. in 1979 
and the Jos. Schlitz Brewing Co. in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Those purchases made Stroh the nation's third-largest brewer  
behind Miller and Anheuser-Busch Inc., moving 25 million barrels of 
beer a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stroh family put much of its profits back into Detroit,  
spending $150 million over the past 20 years in redevelopment 
projects. The family also sponsored major events such as Fourth of 
July fireworks, the Detroit Grand Prix and the Montreaux-Detroit 
Jazz Festival. 
</P>
<P>
	But soon after it bought Schlitz, the company started losing  
ground, and found itself with too much capacity. It shed workers, 
closing its Detroit brewery in 1985. Four years later, Peter Stroh 
announced the company was looking for a partner or a buyer to help 
pay the company's debts and to add cash. 
</P>
<P>
	The reasons for his move then are the same ones that bedevil the  
company now. Stroh's brands have competed on price. But since the 
1970s, Anheuser-Busch and Miller's parent, the Phillip Morris Cos., 
have spent billions on advertising for their brands and kept costs 
low. 
</P>
<P>
	Those tactics won millions of customers for them. Today, the two  
provide about 77 percent of the beer sold in the country, according 
to Beer Marketer's Insights. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1989, the Stroh family agreed to sell to Coors Brewing Co.,  
but the deal fell apart. Stroh itself later fed a consolidation 
trend in the industry in the purchase of G. Heileman. 
</P>
<P>
	But the company continued to lose market share, and had about 7  
percent of the market in 1998 -- fourth behind Anheuser, Miller and 
Coors. 
</P>
<P>
	Logan says the company chose to reduce sales, mainly by  
eliminating slow-selling brands, to strengthen profits during the 
price war. She also said the company was running ahead of schedule 
on repaying its debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``This type of pricing strategy driven by these two large  
brewers does damage to all (brewers),'' Logan said. ``It not only 
drives margins down, but in the long term it diminishes brand 
equity and value.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under a scenario described by the Journal Sentinel, based on  
industry speculation, Stroh would be sold to Pabst. Pabst would 
close Stroh's Detroit headquarters and sell its malt liquor brands 
to Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes sense that they would be looking at something like  
that,'' said Jennifer Solomon, an analyst with Saloman Smith 
Barney. ``I would think given the level of discussion and given the 
fact that it's consistent with what's going on in the industry, 
there's something behind the talk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some industry watchers say Stroh could recover -- if overall  
prices go up, and if the company keeps cutting costs. But with 
Anheuser setting a goal of owning 60 percent of the market, such 
moves will be hard. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's happening is that for major brewers, the only way to be  
successful is to steal share from competitors,'' said Gary 
Hemphill, vice president of Beverage Marketing Corp. in New York. 
``Busch and Miller and Coors are being pretty successful.''

<HEADLINE> Space Plan Prototype Suffers Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The first flight of the X-33, prototype for a  
space plane, will be pushed back because of a problem with one of 
its two hydrogen fuel tanks. 
</P>
<P>
	The X-33 is a $1.2 billion program by NASA and Lockheed Martin  
Corp. to test the design of the VentureStar, an unmanned, reusable 
space vehicle. The X-33 is a scaled-down suborbital version that 
was expected to fly this winter or spring. 
</P>
<P>
	On Dec. 22 at the company's plant in Sunnyvale, Calif., the  
inner wall of one of the fuel tanks separated while being bonded. 
Lockheed Martin has said that making the big tanks to prevent 
seepage of liquid hydrogen would be a major technical challenge, 
requiring development of new processes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Lindeke, spokesman for Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works plant  
in Palmdale, Calif., said Tuesday the problem would delay the first 
X-33 flight by about seven months at the most. 
</P>
<P>
	The X-33 has been plagued by other problems, including a  
five-month delay in the delivery of its engine. When it is 
complete, the 273,000-pound plane will be launched as many as 15 
times from Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave Desert and will 
land at two sites in the West. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed Martin officials still insist they can meet their  
planned 2004 operational date for the VentureStar, which will ferry 
supplies to space stations and place satellites in orbit more 
cheaply than the space shuttle.

<HEADLINE> McCarthy Settles Suit Against NMSU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS CRUCES, N.M. (AP) -- Former New Mexico State basketball coach  
Neil McCarthy settled his lawsuit against the university for 
$835,000 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The school agreed to pay McCarthy in exchange for his agreement  
to dismiss his lawsuit, filed in October 1997 over a 1996 contract. 
The lawsuit was set to go to trial Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarthy, pleased with the settlement, contended that a deal is  
a deal and all he wanted was the reasonable value of the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	New Mexico State president William Conroy said Tuesday that  
removing McCarthy as coach was the right thing to do, but that ``it 
is sometimes difficult and expensive to do the right thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement is about 25 percent of what the former coach  
sought, Conroy said. 
</P>
<P>
	When McCarthy was removed, ``we stated that NMSU would not  
tolerate the perception that winning games outweighs the 
educational mission of this university,'' Conroy said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the university was confident it could have won in court,  
but ``putting an end to this lawsuit was also the right thing to 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State District Judge Robert Robles in December ruled the  
contract between McCarthy and former university president J. 
Michael Orenduff was valid. 
</P>
<P>
	The school had declared the contract void after Orenduff was  
ousted as president. McCarthy then was removed as Aggies head coach 
and reassigned to an assistant athletics director job days later. 
He remained out on sick leave for most of 1997-98; the NMSU regents 
fired him last August. 
</P>
<P>
	NMSU attorneys had claimed the contract was invalid because the  
regents never officially ratified it. They claimed McCarthy was 
employed under a 1994 amendment to a former contract. 
</P>
<P>
	But McCarthy's attorneys countered that NMSU kept paying him  
under the 1996 contract for 10 months -- from November 1996 to 
September 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Robles in December also dismissed four of McCarthy's claims  
against NMSU, including that he was fired in retaliation for filing 
the lawsuit. That left only one claim -- breach of contract.

<HEADLINE> Tampa Bay Gets Nylander for Nazarov </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- The Tampa Bay Lightning, looking to improve  
the NHL's lowest-scoring offense, obtained center-wing Michael 
Nylander from the Calgary Flames on Tuesday for right wing Andrei 
Nazarov. 
</P>
<P>
	Nylander, 26, has two goals and three assists in nine games. He  
spent the first part of the season recovering from a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Lightning coach-general manager Jacques Demers said Nylander  
will play wing on the first or second line and will join the team 
for Thursday's game at Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
	``We needed to upgrade our talent and we've done that,'' Demers  
said. ``We got a tremendous talent who is still a very young man. 
He's 100 percent healthy and excited to be coming down here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nazarov, at 6-foot-5 and 230 pounds, will give the Flames a  
physical forward. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes things don't work out, so I've got to move,''  
Nazarov said. ``I didn't have any problems with the coach or his 
coaching. I was surprised.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year old Nazarov has two goals and 43 penalty minutes in  
26 games.

<HEADLINE> McEnroe Wants His Style Remembered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Now that he's in the Hall of Fame, John McEnroe  
feels comfortable with his place in tennis history. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how he'd like to be remembered after being elected to the  
tennis shrine with Australian Ken McGregor, McEnroe ignored his 
seven Grand Slam championships. Instead, he focused on his style 
and energy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not the biggest. I'm not the strongest. I'm not the  
fastest,'' he said. ``The effort and intensity and understanding of 
technique and doing something adventurous -- that's what I'd like to 
be remembered for. 
</P>
<P>
	``I bought some energy to the sport, a style of play not  
duplicated almost at all. I feel I was a good athlete, in some ways 
underrated. I had reasonable attributes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They would include the famous McEnroe temper, set off by all  
manner of episodes. He doesn't rant and rave anymore, now that he's 
almost 40. But he does get steamed over some things like the 
deterioration of the Davis Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Once considered as important as any of the Slams, the Cup has  
drifted into a second-class citizenship, shrugged off because it 
does not provide players with the two staples of their sport -- 
prize winnings and ranking points. 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe thinks that's a terrible development.  
</P>
<P>
	``When you look back on your career, what do you remember?''  
McEnroe said. ``Being part of the Davis Cup or your ranking and the 
money you won? You don't put aside the chance to represent your 
country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi did that last fall, leaving  
America's semifinal Cup challenge to ailing Jim Courier, who pulled 
out because of an arm injury, veteran Todd Martin and two rookies, 
Justin Gimelstob and Jan-Michael Gambill. They lost 4-1 to Italy in 
Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe was not amused.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not here to badmouth any player,'' he said. ``I can lose  
as easy as they did and bring some energy to it. I'm not quite sure 
why people don't think I can play doubles. I'm hitting better than 
I have for six or eight years. My stated goal is to be the George 
Foreman of tennis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's some tongue in cheek there, but also some truth. He  
admires what Foreman has done in boxing. ``If I could emulate him, 
able to pick his spots,'' he said. The idea is appealing for 
McEnroe, who is No. 1 on the Nuveen Seniors Tour with eight 
victories this season. He can still hit the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe played Davis Cup tennis for 12 years, posting a 59-10  
record. He holds six Cup records, including most singles victories 
(41), and seems almost as proud of those wins as the seven Grand 
Slam titles, 77 singles and 77 doubles championships that led to 
his election to the Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility. 
He was part of five winning Davis Cup teams. 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe said his most memorable match was the five-set loss to  
Bjorn Borg in the finals at Wimbledon in 1980. He pushed that match 
to the limit after winning a fourth-set tiebreaker 18-16. 
</P>
<P>
	``The match with Borg is the one I hear about most,'' McEnroe  
said. ``It showed me that in losing you can elevate your status. 
Even if you don't win every time, if you're part of history that 
makes it OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe had another idea for history.  
</P>
<P>
	With the United States opening the next Davis Cup series at  
England, America must consider its prospects if Sampras and Agassi 
stay home again and the British team is playing at home with Top 10 
players like Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski. 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe looked squarely at David Dinkins, New York's ex-mayor  
and a longtime tennis fan and player, who had come to honor him. 
</P>
<P>
	With a twinkle in his eye, the new Hall of Famer offered an  
idea. 
</P>
<P>
	``McEnroe-Dinkins for the Davis Cup,'' he said. ``We can handle  
Henman and Rusedski. Don't worry.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Calif. Donors Gave $83.7M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- California's deep-pocketed political donors  
led the nation in campaign contributions during the last federal 
election cycle, the Los Angeles Time reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	California donors gave at least $83.7 million to federal  
candidates from virtually every state and both political parties, 
according to a preliminary analysis of fund-raising records 
submitted to the Federal Election Commission. New York was second 
with $82.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota and House  
Democratic leader Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri were among the 
top recipients. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times hired the Campaign Study Group, a Virginia-based  
consulting firm, to review the preliminary election commission 
records. Final numbers were expected in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The Campaign Study Group analyzed individual and corporate  
donations of $200 or more in 1997 and through Oct. 14, 1998. 
Federal law limits individual donations to $1,000 per candidate but 
donors can give unlimited ``soft money'' donations to political 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
	Only corporate officers or corporate political action committees  
can donate directly to candidates. Corporations themselves are 
prohibited from doing so. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's major individual donors heavily favored Democrats in  
the most recent federal election -- the top 25 gave almost twice as 
much to Democrats as to Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, the top 30 corporate donors gave nearly twice as  
much money to Republicans as to Democrats -- $27.5 million compared 
with $14.2 million. In California, however, major corporate donors 
showed slightly more favoritism toward Democrats, the newspaper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``California is one of the few places in the country that has a  
substantial base of wealthy Democratic donors,'' said political 
consultant Darry Sragow. ``If you're running in Indiana, you could 
count on your fingers and toes the significant Democratic donors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The top individual donor to federal campaigns was San Francisco  
developer Walter H. Shorenstein, a longtime major Democratic 
fundraiser. He gave at least $463,000 to the Democratic National 
Committee.

<HEADLINE> White House To Open Clinton Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- White House lawyers are mounting an aggressive  
defense of President Clinton only hours before he delivers a State 
of the Union address from the very chamber where he was impeached 
for ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In opening arguments before the Senate, Clinton's defense team  
was focusing on conflicts in testimony gathered by Independent 
Counsel Kenneth Starr, a shift in strategy aimed at undercutting 
House charges of perjury and obstruction of justice, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Clinton's lawyers have expressed interest in having  
some Democrats from the House Judiciary Committee join the defense 
team, according to officials familiar with the White House 
discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	This will be the second year that Clinton's State of the Union  
address has been clouded by charges of marital infidelities. He 
presented his 1998 speech a few days after the Monica Lewinsky 
story was made public. 
</P>
<P>
	At his trial, meanwhile, the switch from not discussing the  
facts to disputing many of them could bolster Republican demands 
for witnesses to help resolve the disputes. The White House has 
been fighting that prospect but now expects witnesses, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, John Podesta, the White House chief of staff, said  
today there is no assurance that witnesses could resolve whatever 
conflicts might exist in testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think after our defense team has put down the case on the  
facts, the law and the Constitution, have reminded the senators 
there are 60,000 pages of testimony from over 100 witnesses that 
are before them already, they may find there is no need for 
witnesses,'' Podesta said on NBC's ``Today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Clinton's lawyers conclude their arguments, he said, they  
will move to dismiss the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle said Monday that witnesses  
might be inevitable. In an interview with The Associated Press, the 
South Dakota Democrat said witnesses could lead to the spectacle of 
100 senators watching former Ms. Lewinsky, the former White House 
intern, ``point to where the president touched her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., dismissed Daschle's warning as  
``all-or-nothing'' scare tactics that are ``just not true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House GOP prosecutors on Saturday finished a three-day  
presentation of their case in support of two articles of 
impeachment that were approved Dec. 19 on mostly partisan votes. 
The White House will get 24 hours to present its rebuttal. White 
House Counsel Charles F.C. Ruff was to spend several hours 
presenting opening defense arguments today before the trial 
recesses for Clinton's State of the Union address in the House 
chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	After the White House finishes its presentation Friday or  
Saturday, the Senate will submit questions in writing to both 
sides, to be read by Chief Justice William Rehnquist as presiding 
trial officer. 
</P>
<P>
	One area of White House attack is witness testimony in regard to  
the alleged obstruction of justice. Ms. Lewinsky says she got a 
call from Clinton's secretary, Betty Currie, arranging to pick up 
gifts from the president a few hours after Ms. Lewinsky told 
Clinton of her concern that she'd have to turn over the presents to 
lawyers in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit against the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mrs. Currie says she thinks it was Ms. Lewinsky who  
initiated the gift return and Mrs. Currie has testified that she 
has no recollection of ever talking to Clinton about returning the 
gifts, before or after she picked them up. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton legal team credits Mrs. Currie's account, while  
noting that both witnesses testified that the president did not ask 
Ms. Lewinsky to surrender the gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	Such back-and-forth forms the backdrop for Clinton's address  
tonight, when bitter political enemies crowd onto the House floor 
as the president, his legacy already soiled by impeachment, lays 
out his agenda for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders have advised their rank and file to give him a  
courteous, but restrained, reception. Senate Republican aides who 
asked not to be identified said GOP leaders were quietly spreading 
the word that senators should adopt the demeanor of Supreme Court 
justices who will attend and not express themselves during the 
address. 
</P>
<P>
	Absent will be House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde,  
who said he prefers to avoid crowds. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey released Monday by the Pew Research Center for the  
People &AMP; the Press showed that a steady two-thirds of Americans 
want it the trial to end with Clinton still in office, and that 
less than one-third are paying close attention to the historic 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty-nine percent said the trial had not changed their opinions  
about whether the president should be removed from office or 
resign.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Boost Social Security Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will propose in his State of  
the Union address tonight to use most of the government budget 
surplus to bolster Social Security and create new 401(k)-style 
retirement accounts for most American workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The president also will propose using some of the surplus money  
to support the ailing Medicare system, and spending another 11 
percent for military and other domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's proposal includes no income tax cuts and thus is  
certain to set up conflicts with many Republicans who want the 
budget surplus spent, at least in part, to reduce taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president is saying through his plan that by saving  
instead of squandering the surpluses brought on by our discipline 
and prosperity, we can address much of our long-term retirement 
challenge in a way that lifts that burden off our children and 
grandchildren,'' said White House economic adviser Gene Sperling. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's proposals would commit more than $4 trillion in budget  
surpluses expected by the federal government over the next 15 
years. The surpluses are the result of spending curbs lawmakers set 
in the 1997 balanced-budget act and tax revenue flowing from the 
healthy U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will suggest using about 62 percent of the extra money --  
or $2.8 trillion -- to directly bolster Social Security's cash 
reserves. Another 11 percent, or $500 billion, would go to the new 
government-subsidized retirement savings accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 15 percent would go to strengthen Medicare, the nation's  
health insurance program for the elderly and disabled, which like 
Social Security is expected to be financially overburdened by the 
huge, aging baby boom generation. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the surplus -- about 11 percent -- Clinton wants for  
other spending, including military readiness and domestic programs, 
Sperling said. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House estimates the spending would keep Social  
Security solvent through 2054 and Medicare through 2020. Clinton 
also will suggest that other structural changes may be needed, but 
he would leave those choices, which could include raising the 
retirement age, to be decided through bipartisan negotiations with 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House proposal answers Republican congressional  
leaders' demands for Clinton to specify how he wants to see 
surpluses spent, but could continue to thwart the major tax cuts 
many GOP lawmakers want. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have grown increasingly frustrated since Clinton  
asked Congress in last year's State of the Union address to set 
aside surpluses for Social Security, and then let a whole year pass 
without offering a specific plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has been trying to come up with a plan that could appeal  
to both parties, Sperling said. 
</P>
<P>
	Using part of the surplus to help Americans build savings to  
supplement Social Security is something GOP chairmen in the House 
and Senate have proposed. Democratic leaders have said they could 
live with it, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan Clinton intends to outline tonight, 60 percent of  
the expected surplus would be used to add to Social Security's cash 
reserves. Of that, Clinton will propose about one-fourth should be 
invested, in bulk by an independent government board, in the stock 
market in hopes of increasing its value. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Republicans strongly oppose government-controlled  
investment of Social Security money, citing the risk of political 
interference in private companies. They'd prefer to see some Social 
Security taxes diverted into personal accounts that individuals 
would control. But Clinton has sided with Democrats who counter 
that would expose people to too much financial risk. 
</P>
<P>
	The president will ask Congress to help him devise a way that  
bulk investment decisions could be made by a board insulated from 
politics and limited to options such as stock index funds, Sperling 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the Social Security cash infusion would be kept -- as  
the program's cash reserves have been traditionally -- in safer, but 
historically lower-yielding U.S. Treasury bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Clinton administration officials predict, Social  
Security would be prevented from running short of cash until about 
2054 -- more than 20 years longer than is currently expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton would be willing to discuss using the remaining budget  
surpluses only after Social Security is shored up, Sperling said. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, he would ask that another 11 percent of the money go to  
subsidize new Individual Retirement Accounts -- dubbed Universal 
Saving Accounts -- to supplement Social Security benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The accounts would work something like the 401(k) savings plans  
many companies offer, allowing workers to choose among several 
investment options such as stock and bond funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The government would make an annual lump-sum contribution to  
individual accounts, then match workers' own contributions up to a 
limit. The president would want a sliding scale for the matching 
dollars to give bigger subsidies to those with lower incomes, and 
might disqualify the wealthiest -- perhaps the top 5 percent -- from 
the money altogether, Sperling said. 
</P>
<P>
	As a hypothetical example, Sperling said a worker earning  
$45,000 a year might get an initial government payment of $100, 
then a 50 percent government match of his or her own contributions 
up to a maximum of $600. The result would be $1,000 in the worker's 
account at year's end, with $400 of that from the government. 
</P>
<P>
	The portion of the surplus going to Medicare -- about $650  
billion to $700 billion -- would push back the date that program is 
expected to run short of money from 2008 to about 2020, 
administration officials estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will suggest that with additional, structural reforms to  
Social Security and Medicare, the money could go even further. 
</P>
<P>
	The president will ask lawmakers to strive to keep both programs  
fully funded until 2075, to add a Medicare prescription drug 
benefit and provide additional help to single elderly women, now 
the poorest retirees.

<HEADLINE> Ousted Partygoer Fires on Others </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A man who had been bounced from a nightclub  
during a Martin Luther King Day celebration opened fire on people 
leaving the party Tuesday, wounding seven. 
</P>
<P>
	The most seriously hurt was a 20-year-old pregnant woman who was  
shot in the leg. She was in good condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said the gunman was a 20-year-old who had been thrown  
out of the club after a scuffle. The man fired at least 12 shots 
from about 40 yards away. 
</P>
<P>
	``He randomly fired what we believe was a semiautomatic weapon  
into the crowd. The sad thing is seven were shot, but we're lucky 
more weren't hurt,'' Detective Al Gonzales said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police chased the gunman's car but lost him.  
</P>
<P>
	The wounded included a security guard -- an off-duty police  
officer -- whose bulletproof vest stopped a bullet.

<HEADLINE> Delgado, Sele Seeking Raises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Toronto first baseman Carlos Delgado sought $6.5  
million and Texas pitcher Aaron Sele asked for $6.25 million, the 
top figures Tuesday when 38 players exchanged salary arbitration 
numbers with their teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore catcher Charles Johnson asked for $5.1 million and New  
York Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter asked for $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 62 players filed for arbitration last week. There  
were 14 settlements Tuesday, led by Yankees pitcher Andy Pettitte's 
one-year deal for $5.95 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The 38 players who swapped figures -- down from 60 last year --  
are believed to be the fewest since 1979. Players who do not settle 
will be scheduled for arbitration hearings from Feb. 1-21, but no 
more than 10 cases are expected to go that far. 
</P>
<P>
	Delgado made $2.4 million last year, when he hit .292 with 38  
homers and 115 RBIs, and had been rumored to be thinking of asking 
$9 million. The Blue Jays countered him at $4.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Sele earned $2.85 million last year, when he went 19-11 with a  
4.23 ERA. The Rangers offered $4.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter and Yankees closer Mariano Rivera, who each made $750,000  
last season, are both guaranteed big raises. Jeter was offered $3.2 
million, and Rivera sought $4.25 million and was offered $3 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees owner George Steinbrenner said he hoped Jeter and Rivera  
would work out deals before hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be nice with all the team coming back, but I don't  
handle that, so I can't say,'' Steinbrenner said during an NHL game 
between Buffalo and Tampa Bay. ``They'll bring it to me and say 
would you approve of this or that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, traded from Los Angeles to Baltimore in the offseason,  
was offered $3.6 million by Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures for other top players: Houston closer Billy Wagner  
($3.3 million-$2 million); San Diego pitcher Sterling Hitchcock 
($4.75 million-$3.85 million); New York Mets second baseman Edgardo 
Alfonzo ($3.85 million-$2.5 million); St. Louis pitcher Darren 
Oliver ($4.15 million-$3.55 million) and Chicago White Sox second 
baseman Ray Durham ($4.3 million-$3.35 million). 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland reliever Ron Villone had the smallest range, asking  
for $500,000 and being offered $425,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Pettitte, Houston right-hander Jay Powell got a  
$3.65 million, three-year contract and 12 players agreed to 
one-year deals: Chicago Cubs infielder Jose Hernandez ($2.4 
million), Montreal right-hander Dustin Hermanson ($2.05 million), 
Chicago White Sox right-hander James Baldwin ($1.9 million), Los 
Angeles right-hander Darren Dreifort ($1.9 million), Houston 
right-hander Sean Bergman ($1,875,000), Anaheim right-hander Steve 
Sparks ($1.35 million), Detroit right-hander Bryce Florie ($1.3 
million), Oakland right-hander T.J. Mathews ($750,000), Cubs 
catcher Tyler Houston ($715,000), Philadelphia left-hander Paul 
Spoljaric ($750,000), Texas catcher Gregg Zaun ($425,000) and Tampa 
Bay left-hander Terrell Wade ($250,000) 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the New York Mets had a tentative deal with  
right-hander Jason Isringhausen. 
</P>
<P>
	Among free agents, the Mets agreed to a $750,000, one-year  
contract with left-hander Allen Watson, Minnesota agreed to a minor 
league contract with right-hander Bob Wells and Toronto agreed to a 
minor league contract with right-hander Vincente Palacios.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From State of Union Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from President Clinton's State of the Union address:  
</P>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, at your swearing in you asked us all to work  
together in a spirit of civility and bipartisanship. Mr. Speaker, 
let's do exactly that. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	My fellow Americans, I stand before you tonight to report that  
the state of our union is strong. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, America is working again. The promise of our future is  
limitless. But we cannot realize that promise if we allow the hum 
of our prosperity to lull us into complacency. How we fare as a 
nation far into the 21st century depends upon what we do as a 
nation today. 
</P>
<P>
	So, with our budget surplus growing, our economy expanding, our  
confidence rising, now is the moment for this generation to meet 
our historic responsibility to the 21st century. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	First and above all, we must save Social Security for the 21st  
century. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The best way to keep Social Security a rock-solid guarantee is  
not to make drastic cuts in benefits, not to raise payroll tax 
rates, not to drain resources from Social Security in the name of 
saving it. Instead, I propose that we make the historic decision to 
invest the surplus to save Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	... So let me say to you tonight, I reach out my hand to all of  
you in both houses in both parties and ask that we join together in 
saying to the American people, we will save Social Security now. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	I can tell you that one of the greatest concerns of our  
generation is our absolute determination not to let our growing old 
place an intolerable burden on our children and their ability to 
raise our grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	Our economic success and our fiscal discipline now give us the  
opportunity to lift that burden from their shoulders, and we should 
take it. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	No child should graduate from high school with a diploma her or  
she can't read. We do our children no favors when we allow them to 
pass from grade to grade without mastering the material. 
</P>
<P>
	But we can't just hold students back because the system fails  
them. So my balanced budget triples the funding for summer school 
and after-school programs to keep a million children learning. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Today too many schools are so old they're falling apart, or so  
over crowded students are learning in trailers. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, Congress missed the opportunity to change that. This  
year, with 53 million children in our schools, Congress must not 
miss that opportunity again. I ask you to help our communities 
build or modernize 5,000 schools. 
</P>
<P>
	If we do these things -- end social promotion, turn around  
failing schools, build modern ones, support qualified teachers, 
promote innovation, competition and discipline -- then we will begin 
to meet our generation's historic responsibility to create 21st 
century schools. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The most basic tool of all is a decent income. So let's raise  
the minimum wage by a dollar an hour over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
	And let's make sure that women and men get equal pay for equal  
work by strengthening enforcement of the equal pay laws. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Managed care has literally transformed medicine in America,  
driving down costs, but threatening to drive down quality as well. 
I think we ought to say to every American, you should have the 
right to know all your medical options, not just the cheapest. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Smoking has cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars under  
Medicare and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	... Taxpayers shouldn't pay for the cost of lung cancer,  
emphysema, and other smoking-related illnesses; the tobacco 
companies should. 
</P>
<P>
	So tonight I announce that the Justice Department is preparing a  
litigation plan to take the tobacco companies to court and with the 
funds we recover to strengthen Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	I want all the folks at home listening to this to know that we  
need every state and local government, every business large and 
small to work with us to make sure that this Y2K computer bug will 
be remembered as the last headache of the 20th century, not the 
first crisis of the 21st. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Today, much of the world is in recession, with Asia hit  
especially hard. This is the most serious financial crisis in half 
a century. ... 
</P>
<P>
	When you come right down to it, now that the world economy is  
becoming more and more integrated, we have to do in the world what 
we spent the better part of this century doing here at home. We 
have got to put a human face on the global economy. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	All Americans can be proud that our leadership renewed hope for  
lasting peace in the Middle East. ... 
</P>
<P>
	I ask Congress to provide resources so that all parties can  
implement the Wye Agreement, to protect Israel's security, to 
stimulate the Palestinian economy, to support our friends in 
Jordan. We must not -- we dare not let them down. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	For nearly a decade, Iraq has defied its obligation to destroy  
its weapons of terror and the missiles to deliver them. America 
will continue to contain Saddam and we will work for the day when 
Iraq has a government worthy of its people. 
</P>
<P>
	Now last month in our action over Iraq, our troops were superb.  
Their mission was so flawlessly executed that we risk taking for 
granted the bravery and the skill it required. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	As we work for peace, we must also meet threats to our nation's  
security, including increased danger from outlaw nations and 
terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	We will defend our security wherever we are threatened -- as we  
did this summer when we struck at Osama bin Laden's network of 
terror. 
</P>
<P>
	The bombing of our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania reminds us  
again of the risks faced every day by those who represent America 
to the world. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	We must continue to support security and stability in Europe and  
Asia -- expanding NATO and defining its new missions, maintaining 
our alliance with Japan, with Korea, with our other Asian allies, 
and engaging China. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	I ask Congress to restore the five-day waiting period for buying  
a handgun and extend the Brady Bill to prevent juveniles who commit 
violent crimes from buying a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	We must do more to keep our schools the safest places in our  
communities. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Discrimination or violence because of race or religion, ancestry  
or gender, disability or sexual orientation, is wrong and it ought 
to be illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	We must all be profoundly grateful for the magnificent  
achievements of our forbearers in this century. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet perhaps in the daily press of events, in the clash of  
controversy, we don't see our own time for what it truly is -- a new 
dawn for America. 
</P>
<P>
	A hundred years from tonight another American president will  
stand in this place and report on the State of the Union. He or she 
will look back on the 21st century shaped in so many ways by the 
decisions we make here and now. 
</P>
<P>
	So let it be said of us then that we were thinking not only of  
our time, but of their time; that we reached as high as our ideals; 
that we put aside our divisions and found a new hour of healing and 
hopefulness; that we joined together to serve and strengthen the 
land we love. 
</P>
<P>
	My fellow Americans, this is our moment. Let us lift our eyes as  
one nation, and from the mountaintop of this American century, look 
ahead to the next one -- asking God's blessing on our endeavors and 
on our beloved country.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Seeks Curbs on Drug Raiders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDWAY, Calif. (AP) -- For years, federal helicopters have buzzed  
over a lush stretch of Northern California in search of marijuana 
patches, scaring livestock and angering residents who don't like 
the noise. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, fed-up homeowners are hoping to help the government  
literally rewrite the book on drug raiding. 
</P>
<P>
	At an unusual public hearing Monday, two dozen people offered  
testimony to advise the federal Bureau of Land Management on the 
handbook it must write on how to conduct raids in the region known 
as ``The Emerald Triangle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The rule book would be something written down that people  
could see in advance and they would know what was coming,'' said Ed 
Denson, a ranch owner. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, U.S. District Judge Fern Smith approved a settlement  
that ordered the BLM to craft new guidelines for its agents 
conducting the annual harvest-season raids. It followed years of 
litigation over 1990's ``Operation Greensweep,'' in which state, 
local and federal agents, and Army troops raided pot farms. 
</P>
<P>
	Local residents have long complained that the noise and  
propeller wash from the choppers harms the environment because the 
craft fly too low. 
</P>
<P>
	BLM authorities, citing security concerns, did not attend  
Monday's hearing, which was supervised by a retired state justice. 
But residents' testimony will be included in the record when 
federal officials consider public comment for the book. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to be here to see what it is like -- from the first of  
August through September, it's like a war zone,'' said Dan Weaver. 
``The big problem is these helicopters. This whole thing would be 
calmed down significantly by getting those guys up higher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denson said helicopters buzzed his barn and frightened his  
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``They say they fly at 500 feet, but actually, they're coming in  
at 200 feet. We're saying the handbook should require them to fly 
at least 1,000 to 1,500 feet,'' said Denson, who lives in Redway, 
about 220 miles north of San Francisco in Humboldt County. 
</P>
<P>
	Humboldt, Mendocino and Trinity counties are known for their  
lush wilderness and the region is the richest marijuana growing 
area in the nation. Last year, authorities reportedly seized 1,100 
marijuana plants and more than eight tons of cultivation gear in 
just one raid. 
</P>
<P>
	The handbook, which is expected to be out in June, will govern  
only BLM raids, but other local, state and federal agencies that 
confiscate pot plants also are expected to use the book as a guide.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Sliding; Dow Down 86 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks were continuing to slide at  
midday on fears that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan might 
attempt to cool the market's advances. But Nasdaq stocks were 
higher Internet shares continued to rise. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 86.77 at 9,253.78, after rising as high as 9,398.99, up 58.44, 
in the first hour. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite, which is heavily weighted in technology  
shares, was up 25.23 at 2,373.43, although it had narrowed its gain 
from the best level of the day, up 46.19 at 2,394.39. And the 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 3.94 at 1,239.32. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues overtood advancners by a 9-to-8 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 372.86 million 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Eugene Peroni, technical analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott in  
Philadelphia, said the market was backing up on fears that 
Greenspan will testify before Congress on Wednesday that the market 
has gone too far too fast. 
</P>
<P>
	Any hint that Greenspan is reasserting his ``irrational  
exuberance'' warning of last year will squelch already dim hopes 
that the Fed will ease interest rates soon, Peroni said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of the big moves in Internet stocks and the fact that  
the down has gone on to make a new high recently, the bias seems to 
favor that he will be a bit more cautious,'' Peroni said. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology shares got a boost from the announcement that At Home  
Corp. will buy Excite Inc., one of the leading destinations on the 
World Wide Web, for about $6.7 billion in stock in one of the 
largest Internet company deals ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Excite's shares shot up 26 15/16 to 94 7/16, but At Home's  
shares were down 1/2 at 101 1/2 after being higher earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet-related stocks were higher. On the Big Board, AOL was  
up 2 1/2 at 149. In Nasdaq trading, Lycos was up 15 1/8 at 103. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was digesting an unusually large helping of corporate  
earnings reports. Industrial companies reporting this morning 
included Honeywell, Clorox, Parker-Hannifin and Morton 
International. 
</P>
<P>
	High-profile financial services companies reporting this morning  
included Chase Manhattan; Bear, Stearns; BankAmerica and Keycorp. 
Chase shares were up 2 1/4 at 73 1/8, but BankAmerica's were down 1 13/16 
at 62 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Chase report fourth-quarter net earnings of $1.31 per diluted  
share, compared with 97 cents a year ago. Analysts had expected 
Chase to earn $1.19. BankAmerica reported fourth-quarter net income 
of 66 cents per diluted share, down from 81 cents a year ago, with 
charges in both quarters. Analysts had expected 93 cents a share.

<HEADLINE> Motion Ahead in Okla. Bombing Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Attorneys for convicted Oklahoma City bombing  
conspirator Terry Nichols say they will ask for a new trial after 
they review 12,000 witness statements turned over by prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief filed Tuesday with the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of  
Appeals, Nichols' attorney Michael Tigar said he didn't learn the 
government had thousands of witness statements until during the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``Another motion for a new trial will be filed when a review of  
these is completed, but this episode illustrates the double 
standard at work here,'' Tigar said. 
</P>
<P>
	The motion will be his second before the appeals court. Nichols'  
first motion for a new trial is scheduled to be heard Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal jury convicted Nichols a year ago of involuntary  
manslaughter and conspiracy in the 1995 blast that killed 168 
people and injured hundreds of others. He was sentenced to life in 
prison and ordered to pay $14.5 million in restitution. 
</P>
<P>
	He was acquitted of murder, explosives and property-destruction  
charges. Co-defendant Timothy McVeigh was convicted of murder and 
other charges and sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Tigar said he was reserving the right to go back to the appeals  
court because federal prosecutors withheld crucial evidence that 
could have helped Nichols. 
</P>
<P>
	Tigar said he learned of the evidence after an FBI agent  
admitted during the trial that a witness described a gray truck at 
a Kansas lake, where prosecutors contend the bomb was made, and 
that the official report changed the color to blue. Nichols owned a 
blue GMC pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
	Tigar said the defense team is reviewing the statements to see  
if there are other discrepancies.

<HEADLINE> NYC Mayor Softens Stand on Garbage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York City's mayor appears to have put a lid  
on talk that other states have a duty to haul away city garbage 
since out-of-towners take advantage of the Big Apple's resources. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never said they were obligated to do it,'' Mayor Rudolph  
Giuliani said Monday. ``We pay them for it; this is a business. 
This isn't a question of obligation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani's remarks seem to be a retreat from his controversial  
statements last week in which he claimed that since tourists 
benefit from spending time in New York, they also should accept New 
York trash. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have room here to handle the garbage that's produced  
not just by New Yorkers, but the 3 million more people who come 
here that utilize the place every day,'' the mayor said then. 
``This is a reciprocal relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those comments angered lawmakers in states like Virginia and New  
Jersey, where New York ships thousands of tons of waste for 
disposal every year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't say, ``You should take it,''' the mayor explained  
Monday. ``I said, `If you want to do business with us, we're 
willing to do business with you.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Cristyne Lategano, Giuliani's communications director, said  
Monday the mayor's earlier statements had been misconstrued in the 
media and by Virginia politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore said he wanted to curb the  
dumping of out-of-state trash in Virginia, and ban barges from 
moving trash on state waterways. 
</P>
<P>
	He was reacting to word that Waste Management Inc., a  
trash-disposal company, wants to dump an additional 4,000 tons of 
New York City trash in Virginia every day. 
</P>
<P>
	The company already ships out 2,400 tons of New York City trash  
daily. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman was blunt in  
commenting on New York's plan to ship garbage to transfer stations 
in her state, saying ``Drop dead.''

<HEADLINE> Seagram Expected To Start Layoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Seagram Co. will lay off more than 500 people  
in the first round of job cuts as it merges its Universal Music 
Group with Polygram NV, the former rival it acquired last month, 
sources said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The layoffs, expected to begin as early as Thursday in New York  
and Los Angeles, eventually will include 3,000 of 15,500 music 
division employees. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, as many as 200 artists could be cut from a diverse  
roster that includes Sheryl Crow, Boyz II Men, Nine Inch Nails and 
Luciano Pavarotti, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Bernstein, spokesman for Universal Music Group, declined to  
comment on the layoffs or discuss which artists would see their 
contracts terminated. 
</P>
<P>
	Seagram, hurt by a string of box office disappointments, said  
when it acquired Polygram it would fire workers and artists as part 
of a plan to save $300 million by combining the Universal and 
Polygram music operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said previously the consolidation would include  
merging a number of record labels. Island Records and Mercury 
Records will be merged into a single label. Polygram's Verve and 
Universal's GRP jazz labels also will combine. Motown and Universal 
will merge, and Interscope, Geffen and A&AMP;M will become units of 
Universal's West Coast music group. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street generally has been positive about the Polygram  
acquisition and the plans for cost savings in the music division, 
said Linda Bannister, an analyst with Edward Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were some cost savings to be realized, and that includes  
head count reductions. It's definitely a positive step,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Seagram was hurt in 1998 by box office disappointments and an  
exodus of key film executives. Two of its big fall releases, 
``Babe: Pig in the City'' and ``Meet Joe Black,'' were flops that 
led to the departure of Universal Pictures chairman Casey Silver 
and Universal's chief executive, Frank Biondi Jr. Other 
disappointments included the political satire ``Primary Colors'' 
and the comedy ``BASEketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company has had better luck so far this year. ``Patch  
Adams,'' the Robin Williams comedy, is among the hit films of the 
new year with earnings expected to top $100 million this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The disappointments have taken a toll on Seagram's stock, which  
has fluctuated from a high of $46.68 3/4 to a low of $25.12 1/2 during 
the past 12 months. Seagram shares dropped 31 1/4 cents to $42.50 on 
the New York Stock Exchange Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a move unrelated to the layoffs, Seagram on Tuesday announced  
it reached an agreement in principle to sell some Polygram film 
library assets to Carlton Communications PLC for $150 million in 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale includes about 200 movies, including ``The Eagle has  
Landed'' and ``The Big Easy,'' along with 9,000 hours of television 
programming.

<HEADLINE> Court Won't Revive Abortion Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today refused to revive a  
1994 defamation lawsuit that Operation Rescue and three of its 
leaders filed against Sen. Edward M. Kennedy for linking the 
anti-abortion group to murder and other violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices let stand rulings that immunized Kennedy, D-Mass.,  
and later the federal government, from being sued over his 
comments. 
</P>
<P>
	The rejected appeal said lower courts wrongly concluded that a  
federal law giving governmental employees such legal protection was 
intended to include members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit filed by Operation Rescue National, Randall Terry,  
Philip Lawler and Robert Jewitt stemmed from Kennedy's Nov. 15, 
1993, attendance at a fund-raising luncheon in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	At a post-luncheon news conference, Kennedy discussed a  
then-pending bill to give abortion clinics federal protection 
against the use or threat of violence, physical obstruction or 
destruction of property. Kennedy was the primary sponsor of the 
bill that became the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act of 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to a question, Kennedy said, ``People can have a  
difference on public policy issues, but when we have a national 
organization like Operation Rescue that has as a matter of national 
policy firebombing and even murder, that's unacceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The anti-abortion group known for sponsoring massive blockades  
at abortion clinics across the nation sued Kennedy in a 
Massachusetts state court, accusing him of defamation. 
</P>
<P>
	The group and the three leaders who sued ``have never advocated  
firebombing or murder as part of their opposition to abortion,'' 
their lawyers said. The lawsuit said Kennedy had falsely accused 
them of criminal conduct, and by doing so had hurt their 
reputations. 
</P>
<P>
	The state court case was transferred to a federal court and the  
federal government replaced Kennedy as the defendant. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1988 law, called the Westfall Act, amended the Federal Tort  
Claims Act to make such a transfer and substitution possible when 
federal employees are sued for acts taken within the scope of their 
official duties. The law also grants legal immunity to all 
``officers or employees'' of the federal government's three 
branches. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge relied on the 1988 law in throwing out the  
lawsuit, and the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the 
dismissal after agreeing that Congress intended to include its own 
members in the definition of ``officers and employees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Operation Rescue vs. U.S., 98-525.

	Many companies take out ``key man'' insurance -- a specially

<HEADLINE> Microsoft, 3Com To Develop Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. and computer hardware maker 3Com  
Corp. plan to work together to develop network products based on 
Microsoft's Windows operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the alliance, announced Tuesday, Santa Clara,  
Calif.-based 3Com will open a development center near Microsoft's 
headquarters in Redmond to devise and test new products. 
</P>
<P>
	The Microsoft-3Com arrangement is aimed primarily at corporate  
and other large organization digital networks, although some 
products will be targeted at home users. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate announcement Tuesday, Microsoft archrival Sun  
Microsystems Inc. said it would collaborate with Royal Philips 
Electronics and Sony Corp. on technology to link household 
appliances together. 
</P>
<P>
	3Com is a leading manufacturer of computer modems and network  
switching and routing hardware. It also makes the popular Palm line 
of handheld computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies said they would step up efforts to develop  
``converged networks'' that can carry voice, video and text data 
over a single system. 
</P>
<P>
	Traditionally, companies and organizations have had to maintain  
separate systems for telephone, television, computer data and other 
methods of transmitting information. But the emergence of digital 
systems and high-capacity data carriers has allowed those different 
types of data to be transmitted over a common network. 
</P>
<P>
	That should save companies money, Microsoft and 3Com officials  
said, while allowing them to offer new services that combine 
computer, video and voice data. 
</P>
<P>
	3Com plans to embed elements of the new Windows 2000 operating  
system in some of its products, including the high-speed switches 
that transfer data within corporate networks. 
</P>
<P>
	For individual consumers, 3Com and Microsoft are working on  
in-home networks and high-speed Internet access. By the first half 
of this year, 3Com will package Microsoft software with its cable 
and high-capacity telephone line modems. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Sun, Philips and Sony said they plan to develop a way  
to link home appliances that use the Home Audio-Video 
interoperability technology to outside services that use Sun's Jini 
software. 
</P>
<P>
	The HAVi specifications, created by Sony and seven other major  
home electronics manufacturers, let different digital devices, such 
as stereos, computers and televisions, link together in a home 
network. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun's Jini is written in the Palo Alto, Calif., company's Java  
language, which can run on all types of computers, making it easier 
to get devices to work together. 
</P>
<P>
	Combining Jini and HAVi will allow people to operate digital  
electronic products in their homes from remote or mobile locations. 
It also would allow access to a wide variety of outside services, 
such as having a newspaper print directly to a customer's home 
printer, Sun said.

<HEADLINE> Tennis Hall Enshrines McEnroe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Almost 40 now and a member of the Hall of Fame,  
John McEnroe is still feisty and ready to defend the United States' 
honor at the Davis Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	He is convinced he could do as good a job, at least in doubles,  
as most of the players showing up lately. 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe, elected Tuesday with Australian Ken McGregor, never has  
quite figured out the deterioration of Davis Cup on the tennis 
landscape. Many players prefer to show up at smaller tournaments 
where they can earn ranking points and prize money, both 
unavailable, at the Davis Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	When top players make that choice, it leaves McEnroe puzzled and  
troubled. 
</P>
<P>
	``What more can you ask than a chance to represent your  
country?'' he said. ``Tennis is a selfish, individual game. There's 
no better way to blow off tension than to play Davis Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe played Davis Cup tennis for 12 years, posting a 59-10  
record. He holds six Cup records, including most singles victories 
(41), and seems almost as proud of those wins as the seven Grand 
Slam titles, 77 singles and 77 doubles championships that led to 
his election to the Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility. 
He was part of five winning Davis Cup teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes, McEnroe said, he played Davis Cup at times when he  
might have preferred to be doing something else. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't easy to lose to (Jimmy) Connors in five sets at  
Wimbledon, then go play Davis Cup,'' he said. ``I was exhausted, 
but what better thing could I do? 
</P>
<P>
	``The tradition of the sport is important. Davis Cup is  
important for the game. It's bigger than the players in my opinion. 
Others feel differently, apparently.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, with Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi saying they wanted  
no part of it, the United States Davis Cup team was composed of 
ailing Jim Courier, who pulled out because of an arm injury, 
veteran Todd Martin and two rookies, Justin Gimelstob and 
Jan-Michael Gambill. They lost 4-1 to Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe was stung by the outcome.  
</P>
<P>
	``I can lose as easy as they did and bring some energy to it,''  
he said. ``I'm not quite sure why people don't think I can play 
doubles. I'm hitting better than I have for six or eight years. My 
stated goal is to be the George Foreman of tennis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That said, there has been no invitation to play. So McEnroe will  
do his hitting in seniors matches. He is No. 1 on the Nuveen 
Seniors Tour with eight victories this season. He also functions as 
the conscience of the sport, reminding players to think about their 
priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you look back on your career, what do you remember?''  
McEnroe said. ``Being part of the Davis Cup or your ranking and the 
money you won? You don't put aside the chance to represent your 
country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the first round of the next Davis Cup, the United States will  
play at England. The Americans' assignment will be all the more 
difficult if its top players stay home and the British team 
includes Top 10 players like Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski. 
</P>
<P>
	Then McEnroe had an idea. He looked squarely at David Dinkins,  
New York's ex-mayor and a longtime tennis fan and player, who had 
come to honor him. 
</P>
<P>
	With a twinkle in his eye, the new Hall of Famer threw out a  
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	``McEnroe-Dinkins for the Davis Cup,'' he said. ``We can handle  
Henman and Rusedski. Don't worry.''

<HEADLINE> Boxer Suffers Neck Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHEVERLY, Md. (AP) -- A neck injury is costing William Joppy a  
chance to defend the WBA middleweight title on Feb. 6, but is 
expected to fight again following the serious auto accident.

Capitol Heights, Md., on Monday when his car was hit broadside by 
another auto.

Dunlop said. ``The driver of the other vehicle was not hurt.''

<HEADLINE> Mets Raise Prices, Add New Seats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York Mets fans can get a close-up look at  
Mike Piazza and his new high-priced teammates -- if they're willing 
to pay. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets said Tuesday they are adding five rows of premium seats  
directly behind home plate. Tickets in the first two rows of the as 
yet unnamed section will cost $150 per game (which comes to $12,150 
for the season), and tickets in the third, fourth and fifth rows 
will cost $100 per game. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be a total of 90 seats in the new section, generating  
about $875,000 in revenue. The exact number of seats in each row 
hasn't been determined, the Mets said. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees started the trend last year, adding 90  
first-row Legends Boxes at a cost of $16,000 for the season, which 
came to an average of $197.53 per game. After winning the World 
Series, the Yankees did not increase the price of those tickets 
this year but raised the price of their best box seats -- which 
include waiter service -- by $5 to $50. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets raised the price of their best regular seats by $10 to  
$45. Those seats also include waiter service. 
</P>
<P>
	Inner field and inner loge boxes increase by $6 to $30, while  
outer field, outer loge and mezzanine boxes increase by $4 to $25. 
Loge reserved goes up $3 to $22, while mezzanine reserved and upper 
boxes go up $3 to $18. 
</P>
<P>
	Upper reserved and the back rows of loge and mezzanine reserved  
increase $1 to $10. Senior citizen seats of specified dates remain 
at $1. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets, who start selling individual game tickets Saturday,  
increased their payroll from $35.0 million in 1997 to $58.7 million 
last season and figure to be at $70 million or so this year after 
signing Piazza to a $91 million, seven-year contract, and giving Al 
Leiter and Robin Ventura $32 million, four-year deals.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Deliver State of Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- On trial in the Senate, President Clinton goes  
before Congress and the nation tonight to make the case for his 
presidency with a State of the Union address setting an ``ambitious 
and activist agenda'' for the remainder of his administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's challenge was to generate interest in his proposals  
among lawmakers still caught up in the impeachment proceedings 
against him, and aides said his speech would be brimming with ideas 
on education, health care, Social Security and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the end of the speech, people will look not at an  
administration that has entered the last two years of office and is 
slowing down, but an administration that is energized and is 
looking forward to moving into the 21st century with an ambitious 
and activist agenda,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the address fell on the same day Clinton's defense team  
began its presentation in the Senate, and White House officials 
conceded that the GOP-controlled Congress wouldn't rush to 
rubber-stamp the agenda of a chief executive many Republicans want 
to see removed from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Undaunted, Clinton's plan was to continue to portray himself  
hard at work on the nation's business, outlining initiatives to 
shore up the Social Security system and renewing calls to build new 
schools, overhaul the campaign finance system and increase the 
minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Clinton challenged Congress to reserve all of the  
burgeoning budget surplus to ``save Social Security first.'' This 
year, the catch phrase is to ``save Social Security now,'' Lockhart 
said. Clinton is proposing to use most of the surplus to build cash 
reserves of the big retirement system and to subsidize 401(k)-style 
accounts that would exist in addition to Social Security benefits, 
but not replace them. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials said the president was prepared to  
challenge Republicans who want to use the surplus for tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's have a good national debate on whether we think ... we  
should use this 15-year surplus from our prosperity and fiscal 
discipline to just enjoy more consumption now, or whether we should 
try to save it in a way that takes care of our major Medicare and 
Social Security savings issues and frees up the next generation to 
not have to deal with this burden,'' said presidential economic 
adviser Gene Sperling. ``That's a good debate we look forward to 
having.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton planned to embrace a minimum-wage proposal sponsored by  
Sen. Edward Kennedy, D- Mass., calling for a 50-cent increase in 
the hourly base pay in September 1999, and another in September 
2000, bringing the rate to $6.15 an hour. A similar plan was 
defeated last year. 
</P>
<P>
	He also will call for a new round of trade negotiations as an  
answer to the current global economic turmoil. The talks would be 
launched in December at a U.S. meeting of the more than 120 nations 
that are members of the World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	And an administration official said the president will seek $1  
billion in block grants to the states to continue the 
welfare-to-work program begun two years ago for another year. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was scheduled to deliver his address at 9 p.m. EST in  
the House chamber before Congress and a live television and radio 
audience. It was here that on Dec. 19 a House bitterly divided 
along party lines voted to impeach him, marking the first time 
since 1868 that a president faced trial in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republicans had urged Clinton to delay his visit to Capitol  
Hill, and senior GOP senators were encouraging colleagues to adopt 
a stoic demeanor for the speech. Dennis Hastert, the new House 
speaker, asked colleagues to be courteous despite ``discomfort'' 
over the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``Out of respect for the office of the presidency and for the  
state of our union, we will listen to the president's remarks 
soberly and with the dignity that befits the United States 
Congress,'' Hastert wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was expected to seek a $110 billion increase in Pentagon  
spending over six years and ask the Congress to allow Americans as 
young as 55 buy into Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	The president has already said that his fiscal 2000 budget to be  
announced next month will seek tax incentives to encourage Wall 
Street to invest in underserved rural and inner-city communities. 
On Monday Education Secretary Richard Riley previewed one of the 
administration's education priorities: to hold states and school 
districts accountable for the achievements of students and 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	The threat to withhold some federal education money from states  
that fail to end social promotions and set standards won the 
enthusiastic approval of a key labor constituency. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very useful for the federal government to put its clout  
behind the kind of things that a number school districts are now 
doing,'' said Sandra Feldman, president of the American Federation 
of Teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Monday, the administration said Clinton would propose a tax  
credit of up to $500 per child, age 1 or younger, to offset costs 
for parents who choose to stay home to care for their kids. The 
proposal is part of a larger child care package that seeks $18 
billion over five years to aid working poor and middle-class 
families. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration also floated a proposal for $1 billion over  
five years to improve health care for many of the nation's 32 
million uninsured adults. The money would be used to encourage 
community clinics and hospitals to work together to keep track of 
patients and make sure they get needed treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	On foreign policy, he will emphasize the importance of fighting  
terrorism and call on the Senate again to ratify the Comprehensive 
Test Ban Treaty. Clinton will call for expanding cooperation and 
assistance to the former Soviet Union to strengthen the safety and 
security of nuclear stockpiles, proposing incentives for Russian 
weapons experts to study nonmilitary research.

<HEADLINE>  McEnroe Named to Tennis Hall of Fame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- John McEnroe, the tempestuous winner of four  
U.S. Open titles and three Wimbledon crowns, was elected to the 
International Tennis Hall of Fame today. 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe produced great tennis, starting with well-placed serves  
and usually ending with sharp, winning volleys. 
</P>
<P>
	But his accomplishments shared equal billing with his tantrums.  
McEnroe could be merciless toward linesmen and referees, berating 
them with profane outbursts that often riled the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Also voted into the hall was Ken McGregor of Australia. He was  
elected as a master player. The two will be inducted into the Hall 
of Fame at Newport, R.I., July 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The youngest player to reach the No. 1 ranking, McEnroe burst  
onto the tennis scene at the French Open in 1977 when he teamed 
with Mary Carillo to win the mixed doubles title. 
</P>
<P>
	Equally skilled in singles and doubles, McEnroe won 77 titles in  
each. Among his 17 major crowns were Wimbledon singles 
championships in 1981, '83 and '84, and U.S. Open singles titles in 
1979-81 and '84. 
</P>
<P>
	He paired with Peter Fleming for doubles champinships at  
Wimbledon in 1979, '81, '83 and '84, and at the U.S. Open in '79, 
'81 and '83. He teamed with Michael Stich to win Wimbledon in '92 
and with Mark Woodforde to capture the U.S. Open in '89. 
</P>
<P>
	As a member of the U.S. Davis Cup team, McEnroe compiled a 59-10  
overall record in 12 years. He was the ATP Tour's Player of the 
Year in '81, '83 and '84, and he and Fleming won Doubles Team of 
the Year honors in '79 and '81. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1980, at 21 years, 15 days, McEnroe became the youngest  
player to achieve the No. 1 ranking. During his career, he was the 
top-ranked men's player for a total of 170 weeks, and finished as 
the No. 1 player four straight years (1981-84). 
</P>
<P>
	McGregor was an integral member of the 1950 Australian Davis Cup  
team that ended the United States' four-year possession of the Cup. 
The Aussies also won the international team trophy in 1951 and '52. 
</P>
<P>
	McGregor teamed with countryman and Hall of Famer Frank Sedgman  
to complete the only male Grand Slam in doubles in 1951, and the 
duo won three of the four majors the following year. McGregor also 
won the U.S. mixed doubles championship with Hall of Famer Margaret 
Osborne duPont in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
	In singles, McGregor was ranked in the top 10 from 1950-52 and  
won the Australian title in 1952, defeating Sedgman in the final.

<HEADLINE> Jets Should Recall Where They Were </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A prolific offense with balance and flare. A stingy defense that  
allowed the second-fewest points in the league, one behind the 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
	A solid coaching staff with a history of championships. Proven  
personnel acquisition skills and a decent amount of room under the 
salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
	A nice mix between youth and experience. An offseason workout  
program that seems to keep players healthy through the grind of 16 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	What more could you want?  
</P>
<P>
	How about a spot in the Super Bowl?  
</P>
<P>
	That explains the long faces as the New York Jets packed their  
belongings and headed into the offseason two weeks and one game 
before they planned. Their 23-10 loss at Denver in the AFC 
championship game clouded their view of an amazing turnaround from 
1-15 two years ago to the AFC East championship and a chance at the 
NFL title for the first time in 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to know that with less than 20 minutes left we were  
still in the game,'' quarterback Vinny Testaverde said, ``and to 
know that we were 30 minutes away from going to the Super Bowl, and 
we were playing the world champs in their backyard, and we were 
playing well. To lose it the way we did, it's hard to accept. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you get blown out, it's easier to accept; then they were  
the better team and you lost. The good thing is we know we can play 
with the best of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When was the last time the Jets could say that?  
</P>
<P>
	The core of the dangerous offense (416 points) is young:  
Keyshawn Johnson, Wayne Chrebet, Curtis Martin, Kevin Mawae, Jason 
Fabini, Dedric Ward, Kyle Brady. 
</P>
<P>
	There is a nice blend of experience and youth, particularly on  
defense, where backs Aaron Glenn, Ray Mickens and Victor Green are 
approaching their primes, while linebackers Bryan Cox and Mo Lewis 
already are there. 
</P>
<P>
	There's the experience that comes with performing well in highly  
pressurized games. 
</P>
<P>
	``From my standpoint, and I hope all our standpoints, this  
season is history,'' said Cox, a key addition as a free agent. 
``You can write all you want about what we did, where we came from 
and how much ... but it wasn't a success, because we didn't attain 
the goal we set out to attain. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we did this year won't help us win one game next year.  
We're not going to sneak up on anyone, we're going to play the No. 
1 schedule in the AFC East and we are going to have to be ready to 
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells will have them ready, as he always does.  
</P>
<P>
	But the Jets play in the toughest division in football, with  
four teams making the playoffs. And the loss at Denver raised a few 
questions, particularly about protecting the ball and producing a 
running game against one of the league's top teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, 1998 was a monumental success for a franchise that had  
never before won a division title since joining the NFL in the 1970 
merger. The Jets were 8-1 at home. They won 13 of 15 games 
Testaverde started. They went into such difficult places as Kansas 
City, New England, Tennessee, Miami and Buffalo and won. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, there were some positives,'' said Cox, a locker  
room leader who had a superb year as a pass rusher, run stuffer and 
general creator of mayhem and doubt for opposing offenses. ``For 
one, I had fun. That's the biggest positive you can take from it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two, we won a lot of games. Three, we dispelled a lot of myths  
and notions about what the New York Jets were. So we did some 
things that were good, but we didn't reach our goal.''

<HEADLINE> Heart-Burning Operation Found Safe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- An operation in which doctors burn away heart  
tissue to try to eliminate heart rhythm disturbances almost always 
succeeds and has low risks, researchers reported today in the 
biggest study ever on the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	The results, the researchers said, should encourage doctors to  
consider radiofrequency catheter ablation over drugs when treating 
patients with certain irregular heart rhythms, including a rapid 
beat. 
</P>
<P>
	``This procedure has clearly moved into a front-line therapy of  
choice,'' said Dr. Eric Prystowsky of the Indiana Heart Institute 
in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings were published in today's issue of Circulation, a  
journal of the American Heart Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Catheter ablation was introduced about 10 years ago and has  
grown rapidly, with thousands now performed every year. The 
irregular heart rhythms treated by catheter ablation are usually 
not life-threatening but cause palpitations that can frighten 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Catheters are threaded through blood vessels from the groin or  
an arm or leg into the heart and used to burn away tissue 
containing nerve pathways that cause the heart to misfire. The 
catheter emits radio frequencies so strong that it can destroy 
tissue. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers looked at 1,050 patients at 18 hospitals who  
underwent a catheter ablation. 
</P>
<P>
	The irregular rhythm, or arrhythmia, disappeared in about 95  
percent of the patients. A few patients needed repeated treatment, 
and 3 percent developed major complications, including three who 
died within a month of the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers said there was a 1 percent risk that patients  
would eventually require a pacemaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients who fare poorly after surgery ``generally have the most  
heart disease. Some of them are going to die, period,'' Prystowsky 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgery generally costs $10,000 to $12,000 and up, and it's  
usually covered by insurance, although insurers frequently require 
that drugs be tried first. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier studies of catheter ablation tended to focus on  
individual, elite hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are numbers we can hang our hats on and will help us  
when we discuss options using this procedure rather than drug 
therapy,'' said the study's lead author, Dr. Hugh Calkins of Johns 
Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Kenneth Ellenbogen, director of cardiac electrophysiology at  
the Medical College of Virginia/Virginia Commonwealth University, 
said the findings seemed to confirm that the technique is 
relatively safe and is a ``very effective alternative to lifelong 
drug therapy.''

<HEADLINE>  New Speaker Hastert on the Rostrum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After four years of having rival Newt Gingrich  
peering over his shoulder, President Clinton had new House Speaker 
Dennis Hastert seated behind him at his State of the Union address 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert, R-Ill., who succeeded the former Rep. Gingrich, R-Ga.,  
as speaker two weeks ago, presided over the address in the House 
chamber along with Vice President Al Gore, the president of the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The new speaker promised two weeks ago to end the partisan  
fighting that marked Congress during Gingrich's speakership. 
Clinton, at the beginning of his speech, commended Hastert for a 
bipartisan spirit and turned around to shake hands with the 
seven-term lawmaker. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hastert took issue with the president's agenda, saying in a  
statement that it lacked a comprehensive tax cut and didn't go far 
enough to bolster national defense and return education to local 
control. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Clinton ``gave another good speech under difficult  
circumstances,'' but cautioned that ``the American people need more 
than good speeches.'' 
</P>

	Nonetheless, Hastert noted that he pledged when he took office  
to work with the Democrats and ``I reaffirm that promise today.''

<HEADLINE> Brewers To Retire Molitor's Number </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Paul Molitor, who is being wooed by the  
Milwaukee Brewers for a front office job, will have his No. 4 
retired in a ceremony at County Stadium this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Molitor will join Hall of Famers Robin Yount (19), Hank Aaron  
(44) and Rollie Fingers (34) as the only Brewers to have their 
numbers retired. Jackie Robinson's No. 42 also has been retired by 
all clubs in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``What great company,'' Molitor told Milwaukee television  
station WTMJ. ``I'm very thankful for that opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Molitor told the station he was still mulling his future, which  
could include going into TV broadcasting or taking a front office 
job with the Brewers or his hometown Minnesota Twins. He said he 
hoped to have a decision sometime in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Molitor is the Brewers' career leading hitter with a .303  
average. 
</P>
<P>
	``Paul is one of the greatest players ever to wear a Brewers  
uniform,'' team president Wendy Selig-Prieb said. ``His 
accomplishments belong in the company of Aaron, Yount and Fingers 
in the history of this franchise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his 21-year major league career, which included 1978-92 with  
the Brewers, Molitor collected 3,319 hits, eighth-best in major 
league history. His 39-game hitting streak in 1987 is the 
fifth-longest in baseball history. 
</P>
<P>
	Molitor, who represented the Brewers at the All-Star game five  
times, hit .355 in the 1982 World Series, which Milwaukee lost in 
seven games to St. Louis. He recorded the first five-hit game in 
Series history.

<HEADLINE> United States Seen in Good Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- By most measures, the state of America, if not  
necessarily the state of the union, is terrific. Crime is down, the 
economy is up, gasoline is cheap and jobs are plentiful. 
</P>
<P>
	And the impeachment trial of the president taking credit for all  
this good news has apparently left Americans unfazed. A new poll 
shows Americans satisfied with their lot and with President Clinton 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a few hiccups last year, the stock market continues to  
defy both expectations and common sense. The Dow Jones industrial 
average hit a new high of 9,643.32 on Jan. 8, following on an 
unprecedented fourth consecutive year of double-digit percentage 
gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Unemployment was 4.3 percent last month -- the lowest monthly  
rate since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	Inflation isn't an issue. Prices for many popular consumer goods  
such as computers and home electronics keep going down. 
</P>
<P>
	Gas prices are cheaper than many young drivers have ever known.  
Practical folks who squeezed into econo-boxes a decade ago are 
happily tooling about in big, gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-year, fixed-rate home mortgages average below 7 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	Crime is at its lowest levels in decades. Every region of the  
nation and communities of all sizes shared in a 5 percent drop in 
serious crimes reported to police in the first half of 1998, the 
FBI reports. In New York City, the mayor is reduced to fretting 
about jaywalkers. 
</P>
<P>
	Welfare caseloads nationwide are down more than 40 percent from  
the high in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans haven't worried about the missile race and throw  
weight and such for a while now. Clinton's economic overtures to 
Fidel Castro's Cuba earlier this month caused barely a ripple at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps not surprisingly, the national mood is downright cheery.  
</P>
<P>
	A survey released this week by the Pew Research Center for the  
People and the Press proclaimed that 53 percent of Americans are 
satisfied with the way things are going -- up from 46 percent a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5  
percentage points, also indicates only 15 percent of people are 
watching a lot of the impeachment trial on television. Two-thirds 
of the public wants Clinton to remain in office.

<HEADLINE> White House Opens Clinton Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- White House Counsel Charles Ruff opened  
President Clinton's impeachment defense Tuesday with ringing 
statements of Clinton's innocence, an attack on the House's ``rush 
to judgment'' and a fervent plea to the senators who will decide 
the president's fate: ``He must not be removed from office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking so quietly at times that some senators strained in  
their seats to listen, Ruff declared that ``William Jefferson 
Clinton is not guilty of the charges'' leveled by the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff spoke from his wheelchair, his breastpocket copy of the  
Constitution on a nearby table, a few hours before Clinton's 
delivery of the State of the Union address across the Capitol in 
the House chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	The awkward juxtaposition -- a somber trial in the shadow of a  
moment of grand political pageantry -- prompted some congressional 
Republicans to announce they would skip the president's speech. 
Many more said they would attend out of respect for the office if 
not for the current occupant. 
</P>
<P>
	In an opening statement, Ruff offered a point-by-point rebuttal  
of each allegation, criticized Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr 
for his handling of witness Linda Tripp and accused the House of 
``prosecutorial ... fudge'' on one key piece of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will defend the president on the facts and on the law and  
on the constitutional principles that must guide your 
deliberations,'' he pledged. 
</P>
<P>
	On emotion, too, as he answered Judiciary Committee Chairman  
Henry Hyde's invocation of America's war dead in remarks last week. 
His father fought at Omaha Beach on D-Day, Ruff said in a chamber 
suddenly grown deathly still. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't fight -- no one fought -- for one side of this case or  
the other,'' Ruff said, his voice quavering. ``He fought as all 
those did for our country, our Constitution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff ridiculed the House's demand for witnesses in the case,  
although Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle conceded on Monday 
that at least some witnesses are likely to be subpoenaed. No formal 
decisions have been made, and the possibility of a sharp partisan 
battle exists in the Senate as the two sides address the issue in 
the next week or so. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Republican sources said GOP leaders were continuing  
to withhold judgment on whether to invite Clinton to testify. They 
noted that Ruff had referred to Clinton's own unspoken thoughts at 
key points in the case on which Republicans accuse him of perjury. 
Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., brought up his own view at a meeting of 
GOP senators that Clinton ``could be compelled to testify'' under 
Senate rules and court decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	One Democrat, California Sen. Barbara Boxer, referred to the  
political undertones of a trial the public appears to want wrapped 
up quickly. A party-line vote on calling witnesses means 
``Republicans will go into the year 2000 as the party of 
impeachment,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But House Republicans said there was no reason for the Senate to  
back off, and several aides suggested that by alluding to 
disagreements about the facts of the case Ruff may have actually 
increased the likelihood that witnesses will be called. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike last week, this time it was the lawmaker-prosecutors who  
sat at their table writing notes as the president's counsel spoke. 
And moments after the day's trial session was over, they rushed out 
a written rebuttal citing several instances of alleged perjury by 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., said of Ruff's presentation: ``He's  
done the best job with what is an inherently weak case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is accused of perjury and obstruction of justice in  
connection with attempting to conceal his sexual relationship with 
Monica Lewinsky. He has not appeared in the Senate for any of the 
trial sessions to date, and is not expected to. 
</P>
<P>
	As has been the case since the trial began, lines of tourists  
formed in the plaza outside the Capitol hoping for a 15-minute turn 
in the public galleries. Among those in the VIP gallery were Whoopi 
Goldberg, the television personality, who watched bent forward, her 
face cupped in her hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff's appearance in the well of the Senate -- he contracted a  
paralyzing disease while in Africa in the 1960s and now works from 
a wheelchair -- came after a three-day presentation of the case 
against the president by the House prosecutors. The White House 
added to its legal team, giving former Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., a 
seat at the table. But officials quickly retreated from a plan to 
enlist help from three House Democrats after objections were 
raised. 
</P>
<P>
	``William Jefferson Clinton is not guilty of the charges that  
have been preferred against him,'' were the first words Ruff 
directed to the senators, and again his last words. ``He did not 
commit perjury. He did not obstruct justice. He must not be removed 
from office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff was biting in his description of the House impeachment  
process. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is not a court anywhere, highest to lowest, that would  
hesitate, if they were confronted with an indictment written like 
these articles, to throw it out,'' Ruff said, glancing toward the 
table where the House prosecutors sat. 
</P>
<P>
	He questioned Starr's decision to permit Mrs. Tripp to provide  
assistance to Paula Jones' lawyers after beginning to cooperate 
with prosecutors. The Jones sexual harassment lawsuit was the 
genesis of the impeachment case, since it was the decision of her 
attorneys to seek depositions from Ms. Lewinsky and the president 
that led to Starr's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff returned to his theory of prosecutorial ``fudge-making''  
later, when he said the House was wrong about its claim that 
Clinton had ordered his secretary to retrieve gifts the president 
had given Ms. Lewinsky. Similarly, he said the House was mistaken 
about a key fact in connection with Clinton's efforts to help Ms. 
Lewinsky find a job, adding ``the prosecutors have got it wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the schedule in effect, the White House is expected to  
continue presenting its defense on Wednesday and Thursday. Friday 
and Saturday have been set aside for senators to ask questions of 
the two teams of attorneys, although the queries will be given to 
Chief Justice William Rehnquist for him to pose as the presiding 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
	The first two days of next week are expected to be taken up with  
debate over an expected White House call to adjourn the trial, and 
on the House's call for witnesses. Under Senate rules, these 
debates will be held behind closed doors, unless two-thirds of the 
Senate decides otherwise. Republican aides said they doubted that 
would happen.

<HEADLINE> Beware Super Bowl Package Tours </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Super Bowl fans may be anxious to travel to  
Miami, but the government has a warning: Make sure your package 
tour includes tickets to the game, or you may be watching from 
afar. 
</P>
<P>
	The Transportation Department reminded sports fans heading to  
the Super Bowl on Jan. 31 that every year there are people fooled 
by tours that appear to be a bargain, but then don't include game 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	If a travel agent or tour representative claims that a game  
ticket is included, the buyer should demand that the ticket -- or a 
written confirmation of a ticket -- be provided at the time of 
purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	The department also suggests buyers pay with a credit card,  
which affords some protection under fair credit practice laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal consumer protection laws require that an operator  
marketing a Super Bowl package, including game tickets, have the 
tickets in hand, or have a written contract for them, before the 
operator starts advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	Those heading to the Super Bowl on public charter flights should  
also know: 
</P>
<P>
	--If the operator makes a major change in the tour -- such as  
changing the flight's departure or arrival city, changing the dates 
of the trip or switching to a hotel not named in the solicitation 
material -- the buyer may cancel and get a full refund. 
</P>
<P>
	--No tour can be canceled less than 10 days before departure,  
except for causes that make it physically impossible to operate it. 
</P>
<P>
	--On such charters, travelers are required to sign and receive a  
copy of a detailed operator-participant contract.

<P>
	Last year, the House passed the bipartisan campaign finance  
reform legislation sponsored by Representatives Shays and Meehan 
and Senators McCain and Feingold. But a partisan minority in the 
Senate blocked reform. So I'd like to say to the House: Pass it 
again, quickly. (Applause.) And I'd like to say to the Senate, I 
hope you will say yes to a stronger American democracy in the year 
2000. Thank you. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1997, our Initiative on Race has sought to bridge the  
divides between and among our people. In its report last fall, the 
Initiative's Advisory Board found that Americans really do want to 
bring our people together across racial lines. We know it's been a 
long journey. For some it goes back to before the beginning of our 
republic, for others back since the Civil War, for others 
throughout the 20th century. But for most of us alive today, in a 
very real sense this journey began 43 years ago when a woman named 
Rosa Parks sat down on a bus in Alabama and wouldn't get up. She's 
sitting down with the first lady tonight, and she may get up or 
not, as she chooses. 
</P>
<P>
	We know that our continuing racial problems are aggravated, as  
the presidential initiative said, by opportunity gaps. The 
initiative I have outlined tonight will help to close them. But we 
know that the discrimination gap has not been fully closed, either. 
</P>
<P>
	Discrimination or violence because of race or religion, ancestry  
or gender, disability or sexual orientation is wrong and it ought 
to be illegal. Therefore, I ask Congress to make the Employment 
Nondiscrimination Act and the Hate Crimes Prevention Act the law of 
the land. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, since every person in America counts, every American ought  
to be counted. We need a census that uses most modern scientific 
methods to do that. 
</P>
<P>
	Our new immigrants must be part of our one America. After all,  
they're revitalizing our cities, they're energizing our culture, 
they're building up our new economy. We have a responsibility to 
make them welcome here, and they have a responsibility to enter the 
mainstream of American life. That means learning English and 
learning about our democratic system of government. There are now 
long waiting lines of immigrants that are trying to do just that. 
Therefore, our budget significantly expands our efforts to help 
them meet their responsibility. I hope you will support it. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether, whether our ancestors came here on the Mayflower, on  
slave ships, whether they came to Ellis Island or LAX in Los 
Angeles, whether they came yesterday or walked this land a thousand 
years ago, our great challenge for the 21st century is to find a 
way to be one America. We can meet all the other challenges if we 
can go forward as one America. 
</P>
<P>
	You know, barely more than 300 days from now, we will cross that  
bridge into the new millennium. This is a moment, as the First Lady 
has said, to honor the past and imagine the future. 
</P>
<P>
	I'd like to take just a minute to honor her for leading our  
Millennium Project, for all she's done for our children, for all 
she has done in her historic role to serve our nation and our best 
ideals at home and abroad. I honor her. Thank you. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year I called on Congress and every citizen to mark the  
millennium by saving America's treasures. Hillary has traveled all 
across the country to inspire recognition and support for saving 
places like Thomas Edison's Invention Factory or Harriet Tubman's 
Home. Now we have to preserve our treasures in every community. And 
tonight, before I close, I want to invite every town, every city, 
every community to become a nationally recognized ``Millennium 
Community'' by launching projects that save our history, promote 
our arts and humanities, prepare our children for the 21st century. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, the response has been remarkable, and I want to say a  
special word of thanks to our private sector partners and to 
members in Congress, of both parties, for their support. Just one 
example: Because of you, the Star Spangled Banner will be preserved 
for the ages. 
</P>
<P>
	In ways large and small, as we look to the millennium, we are  
keeping alive what George Washington called ``the sacred fire of 
liberty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six years ago, I came to office in a time of doubt for America,  
with our economy troubled, our deficit high, our people divided. 
Some even wondered whether our best days were behind us. But across 
this country, in a thousand neighborhoods, I have seen, even amidst 
the pain and uncertainty of recession, the real heart and character 
of America. 
</P>
<P>
	I knew then that we Americans could renew this country.  
</P>
<P>
	Tonight, as I deliver the last State of the Union address of the  
20th century, no one anywhere in the world can doubt the enduring 
resolve and boundless capacity of the American people to work 
toward that ``more perfect union'' of our founders' dreams. 
</P>
<P>
	We're now at the end of a century when generation after  
generation of Americans answered the call to greatness, overcoming 
Depression, lifting up the dispossessed, bringing down barriers to 
racial prejudice, building the largest middle class in history, 
winning two world wars and the ``long twilight struggle'' of the 
Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
	We must all be profoundly grateful for the magnificent  
achievements of our forbears in this century. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet perhaps in the daily press of events, in the clash of  
controversy, we do not see our own time for what it truly is: a new 
dawn for America. 
</P>
<P>
	A hundred years from tonight, another American president will  
stand in this place to report on the State of the Union. He -- or 
she -- will -- will look back -- he or she will look back on a 21st 
century shaped in so many ways by the decisions we make here and 
now. So let it be said of us then that we were thinking not only of 
our time, but of their time; that we reached as high as our ideals; 
that we put aside our divisions and found a new hour of healing and 
hopefulness; that we joined together to serve and strengthen the 
land we love. 
</P>
<P>
	My fellow Americans, this is our moment. Let us lift our eyes as  
one nation, and from the mountaintop of this American century, look 
ahead to the next one, asking God's blessing on our endeavors and 
on our beloved country. 
</P>
<P>
	Thank you, and good evening.

<HEADLINE> Walsh Takes On GM Role With 49ers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Reversing a pattern of high-profile  
executive departures, the San Francisco 49ers have hired Bill Walsh 
as the first step in the rebuilding of their front office. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh, 67, back for a third tour with the 49ers, will take  
charge of the team's football operations as general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	The appointment of Walsh, a three-time Super Bowl winner in 10  
years as 49ers coach and a consultant with the team in 1996, was 
scheduled to be announced at a news conference today. 
</P>
<P>
	He is seen as the stabilizing force in a front office that over  
the last six months has seen its top officers resign or be fired. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Donahue, 54, UCLA's coach for 20 years and a broadcaster  
the past three years, also has been hired as director of player 
personnel, though his addition may not be formally announced until 
later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The team also plans to hire former 49ers receiver Gene  
Washington as an executive vice president, which would make him one 
of the highest ranking blacks in a front office role in the league. 
Washington, 52, currently is the NFL's director of football 
development. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the club quashed speculation about coach Steve  
Mariucci's job security, signing him to a five-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources said Washington's arrival in the San Francisco front  
office probably wouldn't be completed until the 49ers' muddled 
ownership picture is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie DeBartolo is awaiting NFL clearance to resume active  
ownership of the team. He ceded day-to-day control to his sister, 
co-owner Denise DeBartolo York, in December 1997 when he was 
targeted in a Louisiana gambling fraud probe. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo pleaded guilty last October to failing to report a  
felony crime and was placed on probation and fined $2 million. He 
also must testify against former Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards, who 
allegedly received $400,000 from DeBartolo as part of an 
influence-peddling scheme involving issuance of riverboat casino 
licenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL is expected to decide by this spring whether to allow  
DeBartolo to regain control of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh's return puts the the 49ers' front office back on a stable  
course after a series of departures that began in July when Carmen 
Policy quit as team president because of a falling-out with 
DeBartolo. Policy joined Al Lerner's successful bid for the 
Cleveland expansion franchise and is now a minority owner and 
president of the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Dwight Clark resigned as San Francisco's general manager in late  
November to join Policy in assembling the Browns. Larry Thrailkill, 
who succeeded Policy on an interim basis, quit this month and Vinny 
Cerrato was fired last week as director of player personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	John McVay, who came out of retirement to become acting general  
manager and added acting president in the aftermath of Thrailkill's 
departure, is expected to remain with the club through next season 
to help Walsh run the team.

<HEADLINE> McCarthy Settles Suit Against NMSU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS CRUCES, N.M. (AP) -- For a man who soon will come into  
$835,000, Neil McCarthy wasn't in a mood to celebrate Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarthy, who in 12 seasons as the men's basketball coach at New  
Mexico State won 248 games and led the Aggies to five NCAA 
tournaments, was angry at how the university announced it had 
settled his breach-of-contract lawsuit against the school. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the terms of the contract, McCarthy will receive a lump  
sum payment on Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	A press release from the university announcing the settlement  
said that, while the school still believed it would have won the 
case in court, it chose to settle with McCarthy because it was 
``also the right thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``New Mexico State claims they could win the suit, so why didn't  
they go to court?'' the ever fiesty McCarthy asked during an 
interview at his home in west Las Cruces. ``I thought both of us 
could take the high road out of town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A major point of contention for McCarthy was the university's  
statement which said McCarthy's job performance was the overriding 
issue in the decision by athletic director Jim Paul to remove him 
from the coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
	``If my job performance was so bad, why did they reassign me to  
assistant athletic director so that I could work with other coaches 
and make sure they know the NCAA rules?'' McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been one to back off from a bully,'' McCarthy  
added. ``Someone tries to bully me, and I see red.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The battle of words aside, McCarthy concedes his days in Las  
Cruces are running short. He and his wife, Vivian, have put their 
townhouse located near the Picacho Hills Country Club on the market 
and are looking at moving either to San Diego or Salt Lake City, 
where two of their daughters live. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's over for me. I wish the people of Las Cruces the best,''  
McCarthy said. ``I really appreciate the support I've gotten here 
from the community. I had 12 very good years here. They've changed 
the board of regents, they've changed the athletic director, 
they've changed the president and they changed coach McCarthy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCarthy said he has watched the Aggies, now coached by Lou  
Henson, play several times on TV, but has not attended any of their 
home games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been very difficult because I'm a basketball coach and  
never ventured into the land of legal intricacies,'' McCarthy said. 
``It's been quite educative in that regard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCarthy, 58, said he doesn't know if he will seek another  
coaching job, or if he even wants to. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to say what the future holds,'' he said. ``I'm just  
looking to put the last 16 months behind me. I've had some 
inquiries from some pro teams, but it's very difficult to do 
anything when you're in the middle of a litigation battle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And McCarthy is adamant that the school could have settled the  
case much sooner by simply buying out his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole thing could have been settled a week after they  
decided to make a change,'' he said. ``It's a pity they spent so 
much money. The university made itself look bad and the lawyers 
made all the money.''

 *Cincinnati Airport Earns Praise    	
</P>
<P>
	CINCINNATI WINS AIRPORT POPULARITY CONTEST: Airports tend to  
generate more complaints than praise from travelers in the United 
States, but Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport was 
named the second-best airport in the world in a survey by OAG 
Worldwide, a travel information publisher. Singapore's Changi 
Airport was ranked first in the survey of frequent travelers around 
the world, and Copenhagen's Kastrup airport came in third. In the 
rankings of U.S. airports, Cincinnati's airport was followed by 
Denver International Airport and Orlando (Fla.) International 
Airport. 

</P>
<P>
	FROM THE SILVER LINING DEPARTMENT: Yes, the arrival of 2000  
could throw computers out of kilter, creating problems for 
businesses and institutions dependent on high technology, but it 
could also mean opportunities for job seekers. Challenger, Gray &AMP; 
Christmas, an employment consultancy, says bartering agents, who 
could help businesses buy and sell goods in the event of a cash 
shortage, could find they're in demand. So could private security 
officers, who Challenger Gray says could help supplement possibly 
overworked police forces. Therapists might also find they have 
plenty of clients if the frustration level among people trying to 
fix the Y2K problems -- or even among the rest of us -- gets too 
high. 

</P>
<P>
	DREAM OFFICE: Many people who study sleep habits believe it's  
perfectly natural for workers to want to take a nap during the 
afternoon. And according to Inc. magazine, some companies agree. 
Klettke &AMP; Associates, a small Chicago public relations firm, has a 
nap room, and the boss is one of the people frequently using it. At 
PCI Services, a Boston-based company, there are two nap rooms, each 
with a recliner and small cot, to serve 52 employees. Ear plugs are 
available on request. 

</P>
<P>
	VINTAGE YEARS: The approaching end of the century means people  
are compiling lists of the biggest and best of the 1900s. Wine 
Spectator magazine has its own list, 12 wines that range from a 
1900 Chateau Margaux to a 1974 cabernet sauvignon produced by 
Heitz, a California vineyard. Both wines were pricey for their 
times -- the French wine sold for $3, while the Heitz was priced at 
$25. Today, the Margaux would set a buyer back $9,000, while the 
Heitz is a relative bargain at $350.

<HEADLINE> Pluto May Lose Planet Designation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Poor Pluto -- its days as one of our  
solar system's nine major planets may be numbered. 
</P>
<P>
	Two groups within the International Astronomical Union are  
thinking about reclassifying the relatively puny planet, either 
calling it a ``minor planet'' or lumping it in with an entirely new 
class of objects. 
</P>
<P>
	``For at least 20 years, it's been obvious that Pluto doesn't  
fit,'' said University of Maryland astronomer Mike A'Hearn, who 
heads the Planetary Systems Sciences Division of the International 
Astronomical Union. 
</P>
<P>
	With a diameter of only 1,440 miles, Pluto, the planet farthest  
from the sun, is smaller than Earth's moon. And while other ``major 
planets'' have roughly circular orbits, Pluto carves out a sweeping 
ellipse that frequently takes it closer than Neptune, planet No. 8, 
to the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	A'Hearn wants to create a new class of objects for ice balls  
that orbit beyond Neptune and call them Trans-Neptunian Objects. 
Pluto would be Trans-Neptunian Object No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Marsden of the union's Minor Planet Center said he has a  
better idea. He'd like to see Pluto classified as a ``minor 
planet,'' of which there are thousands, then make it take a number. 
The prized number 10,000 will probably come up next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a demotion,'' for Pluto to be referred to as the  
10,000th minor planet, Marsden insisted. ``It's an honor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Mexico astronomer Alan Hale, co-discoverer of Comet  
Hale-Bopp, suggested the debate is somewhat silly since there's 
really no clear definition of what a planet is. And, besides, ``a 
hypothetical resident of Jupiter would probably laugh at our 
calling Earth a `major planet.'''

<HEADLINE>  2 Japan Banks in Tentative Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- In the latest sign of consolidation in Japan's  
troubled banking industry, two trust banks have reached a tentative 
agreement to merge. 
</P>
<P>
	The union of Chuo Trust &AMP; Banking Co. and Mitsui Trust &AMP; Banking  
Co. would create a rival to the country's largest trust bank, 
Mitsubishi Trust &AMP; Banking Co. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing the deal Tuesday, executives from the two banks  
said they hope to complete the deal in April 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike commercial banks catering to retail customers, trust  
banks specialize in managing funds for corporations, pensions and 
big individual investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal comes as Japanese banks struggle to dispose of piles of  
bad loans left from the collapse of property prices nearly a decade 
ago. Many banks have been left holding land as collateral for 
soured loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Those loan problems and sweeping deregualtion in Japan's finance  
industry have prompted many banks to restructure or form alliances, 
often with foreign firms, in order to survive. 
</P>
<P>
	But the combination of Mitsui and Chuo would be the first full  
merger involving major banks since the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi 
Ltd. was formed in 1996 to create a major commercial bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the final arrangements for the deal have not been  
finished, the banks tentatively agreed that one Mitsui Trust share 
would be exchanged for three-tenths of a Chuo Trust share, which 
would value the merger at $1.63 billion as of the close of trading 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	At a press conference, Mitsui president Keiu Nishida and Chuo  
president Shozo Endo said that Chuo would lead the combined 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Together the banks would have assets of some $138 billion,  
second among trust banks only to Mitsubishi Trust and Banking, 
which has $158 billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies had combined revenues of $10 billion in the year  
ended last March. Mitsui is currently Japan's third largest trust 
bank and Chuo the sixth-biggest. 
</P>
<P>
	The banks said they expect current tie-ups with foreign partners  
-- such as the alliance between State Street Trust &AMP; Banking Co. and 
Mitsui Trust -- will contribute to the merged bank.

<HEADLINE> Woman Who Changed Name Off Ballot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Carol Moseley-Braun won't be on the ballot in  
next month's city election. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Lauryn K. Valentine -- who changed her name to match  
the former senator's -- didn't register to vote under her new name 
in time to run for alderman, the Chicago Board of Elections ruled 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Board members also said it appears the 21-year-old market  
researcher intended to mislead voters by changing her name to run 
for public office. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine changed her name to Moseley-Braun in September, saying  
she just wanted to honor her role model. 
</P>
<P>
	Three months later, she announced her bid for alderman in the  
Feb. 23 election, prompting protests from the original 
Moseley-Braun and incumbent Alderman Percy Giles. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Moseley-Braun's campaign manager, Ernest Henton Jr.,  
said he'll appeal the election board's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a total, total miscarriage of justice,'' Henton said.  
``How can one say that it's false and misleading to use your 
name?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giles, who filed the objection, said he feared some people would  
have voted for Moseley-Braun thinking she was the former senator. 
</P>
<P>
	An attorney for the original Moseley-Braun said the 51-year-old  
Chicago Democrat still plans to ask a judge to reverse the name 
change. The former senator lost her re-election bid to Republican 
Peter Fitzgerald in November.

<HEADLINE> Cubs Sign Hernandez, Houston </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Jose Hernandez, who played seven different  
positions last season, agreed with the Chicago Cubs on a $2.4 
million, one-year contract while catcher Tyler Houston accepted a 
$715,000, one-year deal Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez hit .254 last season, setting career highs for 23  
homers (23) and RBIs (75). The five-year veteran, who came to the 
Cubs in a 1993 trade with the Indians, played mostly at third base 
and shortstop. He also had time in left field, center field, first 
base, second base and right field. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston hit nine homers and drove in 33 runs while batting .255  
in 95 games. He can also play third and first. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston homered in Game 1 of the first round of the playoffs  
against Atlanta's John Smoltz. The left-handed hitter, who could 
share time this season with Benito Santiago, has a .272 average in 
246 major league games. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez made $725,000 last season and Houston made made  
$225,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago still has two unsigned players in arbitration: pitchers  
Terry Adams and Matt Karchner. Adams asked for a raise from 
$295,000 to $895,000 and was offered $615,000. Karchner asked for a 
raise from $300,000 to $925,000 and was offered $660,000.

<HEADLINE> NFL Hall Welcomes Diehard Fans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANTON, Ohio (AP) -- Not far from where Joe Namath and Weeb  
Ewbank are immortalized in bronze, Ed Anzalone climbed on someone's 
shoulders and began the war cry that rocks the Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
	``J-E-T-S! Jets! Jets! Jets!'' screamed Anzalone, also known as  
``Fireman Ed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pro Football Hall of Fame never had heard or seen anything  
like it. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time since its doors opened for fans in 1963, the  
hall has fans among its members. It christened its Visa Hall of 
Fans exhibit on Tuesday by recognizing 31 of the most diehard NFL 
fans in the land -- one from each team, including the Cleveland 
Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fireman Ed'' was part of the Hall's Class of '99 along with  
``Mr. Cheer or Die,'' ``Mama Blue,'' ``Jersey John,'' ``Boltman,'' 
``Arrowman,'' ``Green Man,'' ``The Packalope'' and ``Big Dawg,'' 
the leader of the Cleveland Browns' Dawg Pound. 
</P>
<P>
	There was also:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Jerry Vecchia, who has worn at least one piece of clothing  
with the New York Giants logo on it since 1983. ``Twenty-four hours 
a day, seven days a week,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	-- ``Da Pope'', also known as Lionel Alphonso Sr., who began  
dressing like the Pope for every New Orleans Saints home game since 
Pope John Paul II visited the Superdome in 1987. ``Bless you,'' he 
said upon enshrinement. 
</P>
<P>
	-- ``Barrel Man,'' also known as Tim McKernan, who wears an  
orange cowboy hat, boots and an orange barrel supported by 
suspenders over his bare chest -- and bare bottom -- at every Denver 
Broncos home game. ``Gets a little cold sometimes,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a dream come true for all fans and especially for  
these 31,'' said Lido Starelli, who has missed one San Francisco 
49ers game in 53 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Starelli, a San Francisco season-ticket holder since the team's  
founding in 1946, has a room dedicated to the 49ers in his home, 
which includes every program, media guide, lapel pin, stationary, 
Christmas card and pocket schedule from the last 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I saw the 49ers first play, I just fell in love with it.  
My first game was like the birth of my first child,'' he said. 
``The 49ers have given me so many great memories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only time Starelli missed a 49ers home game was in 1959 when  
his father died. 
</P>
<P>
	``December fifth, against the Baltimore Colts,'' he said when  
asked if he remembered the date of that game. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Curtis saw the Atlanta Falcons play their first preseason  
home game in 1965 and hasn't missed one since. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been to 252 regular season games, 62 preseason and 75 out  
of town,'' said Curtis, a retired Air Force colonel. ``And now I'm 
finally going to a Super Bowl.''

<P>
 *UNDATED: they deserve.    	
</P>
<P>
	All Americans can be proud that our leadership renewed hope for  
lasting peace in the Middle East. Some of you were with me last 
December as we watched the Palestinian National Council completely 
renounce its call for the destruction of Israel. Now I ask Congress 
to provide resources so that all parties can implement the Wye 
Agreement, to protect Israel's security, to stimulate the 
Palestinian economy, to support our friends in Jordan. We must not, 
we dare not, let them down. I hope you will help. Thank you. 
</P>
<P>
	As we work for peace, we must also meet threats to our nation's  
security, including increased dangers from outlaw nations and 
terrorism. We will defend our security wherever we are threatened, 
as we did this summer when we struck at Osama bin Laden's network 
of terror. The bombing of our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania 
reminds us again of the risks faced every day by those who 
represent America to the world. So let's give them the support they 
need, the safest possible workplaces, and the resources they must 
have so America can continue to lead. 
</P>
<P>
	We must work to keep terrorists from disrupting computer  
networks. We must work to prepare local communities for biological 
and chemical emergencies, to support research into vaccines and 
treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	We must increase our efforts to restrain the spread of nuclear  
weapons and missiles, from Korea to India and Pakistan. We must 
expand our work with Russia, Ukraine and the other former Soviet 
nations to safeguard nuclear materials and technology so they never 
fall into the wrong hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Our balanced budget will increase funding for these critical  
efforts by almost two-thirds over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
	With Russia, we must continue to reduce our nuclear arsenals.  
The START II Treaty and the framework we have already agreed to for 
START III could cut them by 80 percent from their Cold War height. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been two years since I signed the Comprehensive Test Ban  
Treaty. If we don't do the right thing, other nations won't either. 
I ask the Senate to take this vital step: Approve the Treaty now, 
to make it harder for other nations to develop nuclear arms and to 
make sure we can end nuclear testing forever. 
</P>
<P>
	For nearly a decade, Iraq has defied its obligations to destroy  
its weapons of terror and the missiles to deliver them. America 
will continue to contain Saddam, and we will work for the day when 
Iraq has a government worthy of its people. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, last month, in our action over Iraq, our troops were  
superb. Their mission was so flawlessly executed, that we risk 
taking for granted the bravery and the skill it required. Captain 
Jeff Taliaferro, a 10-year veteran of the Air Force, flew a B-1B 
bomber over Iraq as we attacked Saddam's war machine. He is here 
with us tonight. I'd like to ask you to honor him and all the 
33,000 men and women of Operation Desert Fox. Captain Taliaferro. 
</P>
<P>
	It is time to reverse the decline in defense spending that began  
in 1985. (Applause.) Since April, together we have added nearly $6 
billion to maintain our military readiness. My balanced budget 
calls for a sustained increase over the next six years for 
readiness, for modernization and for pay and benefits for our 
troops and their families. 
</P>
<P>
	You know, we are the heirs of a legacy of bravery represented in  
every community of America by millions of our veterans. America's 
defenders today still stand ready at a moment's notice to go where 
comforts are few and dangers are many, to do what needs to be done 
as no one else can. They always come through for America. We must 
come through for them. 
</P>
<P>
	The new century demands new partnerships for peace and security.  
The United Nations plays a crucial role, with allies sharing 
burdens America might otherwise bear alone. America needs a strong 
and effective U.N. I want to work with this new Congress to pay our 
dues and our debts. Thank you. 
</P>
<P>
	We must continue to support security and stability in Europe and  
Asia, expanding NATO and defining its new missions, maintaining our 
alliance with Japan, with Korea, with our other Asian allies, and 
engaging China. 
</P>
<P>
	In China last year, I said to the leaders and the people what  
I'd like to say again tonight: Stability can no longer be bought at 
the expense of liberty. But I'd also like to say again to the 
American people: It's important not to isolate China. The more we 
bring China into the world, the more the world will bring change 
and freedom to China. 
</P>
<P>
	Last spring, with some of you, I traveled to Africa, where I saw  
democracy and reform rising, but still held back by violence and 
disease. We must fortify African democracy and peace by launching 
Radio Democracy for Africa, supporting the transition to democracy 
now beginning to take place in Nigeria, and passing the African 
Trade and Development Act. Thank you. 
</P>
<P>
	We must continue to deepen our ties to the Americas and the  
Caribbean, our common work to educate children, fight drugs, 
strengthen democracy, and increase trade. 
</P>
<P>
	In this hemisphere, every government but one is freely chosen by  
its people. We are determined that Cuba, too, will know the 
blessings of liberty. 
</P>
<P>
	The American people have opened their hearts and their arms to  
our Central American and Caribbean neighbors who have been so 
devastated by the recent hurricanes. Working with Congress, I am 
committed to help them rebuild. When the first lady and Tipper Gore 
visited the region, they saw thousands of our troops and thousands 
of American volunteers. In the Dominican Republic, Hillary helped 
to rededicate a hospital that had been rebuilt by Dominicans and 
Americans working side by side.

	The government would invest about a quarter of the money in the  
stock market to try to increase its value -- a first for Social 
Security. Investment decisions would be made by an independent 
board. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the cash infusion would be kept, as Social  
Security's reserves have been in the past, in safer, but 
historically lower-yielding, U.S. Treasury bonds. There would be 
one difference, however, as those bonds are purchased in the 
future: Lawmakers could use the proceeds -- essentially money 
borrowed from Social Security by the rest of the government -- only 
to pay down the national debt, not for other spending, as is the 
practice now. 
</P>
<P>
	If the plan is enacted, officials estimate a cash shortage now  
expected to hobble the nation's public pension program starting in 
2032 would be put off by more than 20 years to 2055. Also, the 
nation's publicly held debt by 2014 would drop to its lowest level 
as a percentage of gross domestic product since 1917. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Congress and the White House would consider additional  
structural changes to Social Security, such as raising the 
retirement age. 
</P>
<P>
	--Devote about 11 percent more of the surplus to new retirement  
savings accounts for most American workers that would be separate 
from Social Security, giving people a new source of old-age income. 
Based on current projections, government contributions to the 
accounts would total about $500 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The accounts would work much like the 401(k) savings plans many  
companies offer workers, with a range of investment options such as 
stock and bond funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The government would give each person an annual lump sum for his  
account, then additional contributions paralleling his own savings 
up to a limit. A sliding scale would mean bigger subsidies for 
those with lower incomes and might disqualify the wealthiest, 
perhaps 5 percent, from the money altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, a worker earning $45,000 a year might get an  
initial government payment of $100, then a 50 percent government 
match of the contributions the worker makes up to a maximum of 
$600. The result would be $1,000 in the worker's account at the end 
of the year, with $400 of it coming from the government. 
</P>
<P>
	The lowest-income workers might have their savings fully  
matched.

<HEADLINE> Court Won't Bar Electric Chair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today refused to bar  
Florida's use of the electric chair as the sole means of imposing 
the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices, without comment, rejected an appeal in which death  
row inmate Eduardo Lopez, a convicted murderer, challenged death in 
the electric chair as unlawfully cruel and unusual punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 38 states with capital punishment, only four require  
execution by electrocution. They are Florida, Alabama, Georgia and 
Nebraska. Two others, Tennessee and Kentucky, recently have 
provided for lethal injection as alternative method. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the nation, states employ electrocution, lethal  
injection, hanging, firing squad and the gas chamber to execute 
their worst criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida officials imposed a one-year moratorium on executions  
after a fire started during Pedro Medina's March 25, 1997, 
electrocution. Flames and smoke rose from his head while he was 
strapped into the 74-year-old electric chair and the electric 
current turned on. 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy report said Medina died instantly and had not  
suffered any pain from the fire, blamed on conducting sponges in 
the chair's headpiece. 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida Supreme Court voted 4-3 during the one-year  
moratorium that continued use of the electric chair would not 
violate the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment. 
That decision cited special rules -- a protocol -- that state prison 
officials had adopted in the wake of Medina's execution. 
</P>
<P>
	The Legislature voted last year to keep electrocution as the  
state's only means of execution. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeal acted on today contended, ``Florida continues to  
botch executions, fails to follow the protocol established after 
Mr. Medina was burned alive in the electric chair, and mutilates 
the bodies of condemned inmates in the electric chair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But state prosecutors urged the justices to reject Lopez's  
appeal. ``Nothing in this court's precedents suggests that a method 
of execution that does not involve the infliction of wanton or 
unnecessary pain ... can, or should, be rendered unconstitutional 
simply based upon the number of jurisdictions that do or do not 
allow it,'' they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lopez was sentenced to death for the 1983 murder of a young  
child during a Dade County house robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Lopez vs. Singletary, 98-6065.

<HEADLINE> Pettitte Agrees to 1-Year Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Andy Pettitte is headed for spring training  
instead of a salary arbitration hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Pettitte, the AL's top winner in the last three years, and the  
New York Yankees agreed Tuesday on a one-year deal for $5.95 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Pettitte filed for arbitration last week, but settled before  
exchanging contract proposals with the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad. I like Pettitte,'' Yankees owner George Steinbrenner  
said in Florida at the NHL game between Buffalo and Tampa Bay. ``I 
didn't want any troubles with him. Nobody did, because we really 
like him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pettitte, a 26-year-old left-hander, was 16-11 with a 4.24 ERA  
in 1998, struggling with his control and mechanics for much of the 
season. He came up big in the World Series, pitching 7 1-3 shutout 
innings to win Game 4 as the Yankees completed their sweep of San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	He has won 55 games in the last three seasons, topped in the  
majors only by Atlanta's John Smoltz with 56. 
</P>
<P>
	Pettitte is 67-35 with a 3.75 ERA lifetime, and his .657 winning  
percentage is second among active players with 100 or more starts, 
trailing only Baltimore's Mike Mussina (.667). 
</P>
<P>
	Pettitte made $3.8 million last year and is eligible for free  
agency after the 2000 season. He can reach $6 million this year by 
earning the two bonuses in his contract: $25,000 for 200 innings 
and $25,000 for making the AL All-Star team. 
</P>
<P>
	New York has two players left in arbitration, shortstop Derek  
Jeter and closer Mariano Rivera. Both are eligible for the first 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter, the 1996 AL Rookie of the Year, asked for a raise from  
$750,000 to $5 million -- which would make him the highest-paid 
player ever with just three years of major league service. The 
Yankees offered $3.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera, tied for sixth in the AL with 36 saves last season,  
asked for a raise from $750,000 to $4.25 million and was offered $3 
million.

<HEADLINE> Marion Jones Wins Jesse Owens Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Marion Jones, who threatened Florence Griffith  
Joyner's world sprint records last year, is the winner of the 1999 
Jesse Owens International Trophy Award. 
</P>
<P>
	The sensational 23-year-old Jones, who won 36 of 37 finals last  
year, losing only her last competition, the long jump to Germany's 
Heike Drechsler, received 85 votes in balloting by an international 
panel of electors. 
</P>
<P>
	Cross country skier Bjorn Daehlie of Norway, winner of three  
gold medals and one silver at the 1998 Winter Olympics, finished 
second with 78 votes. Ethiopia's Haile Gebrselassie, who set world 
records at 5,000 and 10,000 meters last year and won the 1998 Jesse 
Owens Award, was third with 38 votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones' victories in the 100 and 200 meters at the World Cup in  
Johannesburg, South Africa in September made her the second-fastest 
ever at those distances, behind Griffith Joyner. Jones was timed in 
10.65 seconds for the 100 and 21.62 for the 200. Griffith Joyner's 
records are 10.49 and 21.34. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Jones also twice long-jumped 23 feet, 11 3/4 inches, the  
best mark in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	She is the first American to be ranked No. 1 in the world in  
three events in the same year. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones will be honored at a dinner Feb. 11 at the Waldorf-Astoria  
Hotel.

<HEADLINE> Watson Signs With Mets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Mets, who made Allen Watson their  
latest addition, say they've given fans a reason to believe this 
year. To pay for that, it will cost a little more to go to the 
ballpark this season. 
</P>
<P>
	As Watson agreed Tuesday to a $750,000, one-year contract, the  
Mets said the price of their best seats will increase by $10 this 
season to $45. And they're adding 90 new seats in five rows right 
behind home plate that will cost $100-$150 per game. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson, a 28-year-old left-hander from Middle Village, N.Y.,  
grew up near Shea Stadium, but was a Yankees fan. He joins a staff 
that already has five starters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll go to spring training and see what happens,'' said  
Watson, who became a free agent last month when Anaheim failed to 
offer him a contract by the Dec. 20 deadline. ``I'd like to 
start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Watson was 6-7 with a 6.04 ERA last year, giving up 122 hits in  
92 1-3 innings. He was hampered by a strained left elbow and went 
on the disabled list from May 24-July 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully I'll get back to where I was the second half last  
year,'' said Watson, 3-2 with a 4.07 ERA in the second half after 
going 3-5 with a 7.69 ERA in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	New York already has starters Al Leiter, Bobby Jones, Rick Reed,  
Hideo Nomo and Masato Yoshii. 
</P>
<P>
	``Left-handed pitchers are such a luxury,'' Mets pitching coach  
Bob Apodaca said. ``We had only Al Leiter, but his strength is 
against right-handed hitters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Watson, who made $2.9 million, gets a $50,000 signing bonus and  
a $700,000 base salary (he is guaranteed $500,000 if he is cut 
during spring training). 
</P>
<P>
	He can earn $1.75 million in bonuses if he starts: $75,000 for  
five starts, $175,000 more for 10 starts, $250,000 for 15, $350,000 
for 20 and $450,000 each for 25 and 27. 
</P>
<P>
	He can earn $250,000 in bonuses if he relieves: $50,000 each for  
45, 50, 53, 55 and 60 appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland also sought Watson, who began his career with St.  
Louis and San Francisco and wanted to return to the National 
League. As a hitter, he has a .255 career average with 19 RBIs in 
165 at-bats -- better numbers than the Mets' No. 8 hitter, shortstop 
Rey Ordonez (.246 with 42 RBIs in 505 at-bats last season). 
</P>
<P>
	In starting their annual caravan, which culminates with the  
opening of single-game ticket sales Saturday, the Mets brought 
nearly a dozen players to Manhattan for the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care how many big players you have on a team, if you  
don't play together, you're not going to win,'' catcher Mike Piazza 
said. ``That's been proven time and time again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York kept Piazza with a $91 million, seven-year contract and  
Leiter with a $32 million, four-year deal, then signed third 
baseman Robin Ventura for $32 million over four years and 
outfielder Rickey Henderson for $2.3 million this season. The Mets 
also obtained reliever Armando Benitez from Baltimore and 
outfielder Bobby Bonilla from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``On paper, we're better than the way we finished last year and  
we're a little better than when we started,'' manager Bobby 
Valentine said. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Pitcher Jason Isringhausen and the Mets reached agreement  
on a one-year contract for $350,000, plus incentives, and didn't 
exchange arbitration numbers. Among the four other Mets still in 
arbitration, infielder Edgardo Alfonzo asked for $3.85 million and 
was offered $2.5 million, Ordonez asked for $2,275,000 and was 
offered $1.25 million, Benitez asked for $2.4 million and was 
offered $1,575,000, and reliever Turk Wendell asked for $1,575,000 
and was offered $1.05 million. ... The $45 seats include waiter 
service. Inner field and inner loge boxes increase by $6 to $30, 
while outer field, outer loge and mezzanine boxes increase by $4 to 
$25. Loge reserved goes up $3 to $22, while mezzanine reserved and 
upper boxes go up $3 to $18. Upper reserved and the back rows of 
loge and mezzanine reserved increase $1 to $10. Senior citizen 
seats of specified dates remain at $1. In the new section, seats in 
the first two rows go for $150, the next three for $100.

<HEADLINE> At Home, Excite Are Neighbors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDWOOD CITY, Calif. (AP) -- At Home Corp. and Excite Inc.  
already had several things in common before the announcement of 
their planned merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Both were launched just three years ago among hundreds of pipe  
dream Silicon Valley upstarts. And together, working from the same 
Redwood City office park, their offices separated by a slimy pond, 
they've watched each other soar. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, when At Home said it would buy Excite, the 1,300  
employees who have worked side by side for years said the $6.7 
billion deal wasn't just a financial merger. It was like the 
joining of two groups of friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``Working weird hours at night, I'd look over and see that their  
lights were on, too,'' said At Home's marketing director Jonathan 
Rosenberg. ``We're really a lot alike.'' 
</P>
<P>
	True, the companies have very different missions. At Home  
provides super high-speed Internet access through cable TV lines 
while Excite is ``portal'' Web site, a place where surfers go to 
get a variety of services such as searching, e-mail and news. 
</P>
<P>
	Excite will be able to use At Home's superior technology to  
replace slow telephone connections to the Internet. This should 
improve the speed and reliability of its content, which includes 
everything from news stories and stock quotes to celebrity chat 
rooms and online shopping venues. By doing so, it hopes to draw 
traffic away from its major competitors, most notably Yahoo!, a 
rival portal which has grown rapidly in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	Excite, started in a garage by six Stanford University graduates  
who borrowed $15,000 from their parents, now gets 17 million 
viewers a month. At Home was founded by a team of high-tech 
veterans looking to run their own show. While it serves just 
330,000 homes, its service is growing fast as Internet users get 
impatient with the slow hookups that telephone lines give them. 
</P>
<P>
	Employees Tuesday said they were certain the deal would enhance  
both companies. At Excite, workers were expressing another 
sentiment: relief that they weren't bought by a much larger 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole company was hearing rumors about Microsoft, AOL,  
Yahoo. I was like, shoot me,'' said Kristin Hoefer, an Excite 
network programming manager in charge of user loyalty. ``When I 
heard it was At Home, I was like, sweet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, between television interviews and photo shoots, top  
managers from both companies chatted by the pond between the 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of our guys have ordered these really cool remote control  
motor boats,'' said said Excite cofounder Joe Kraus. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope they have shooters on them,'' said Milo Medin, At  
Home's Chief Technology Officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, but there's a submarine,'' said Kraus, demonstrating with  
his hands how it will move underwater. 
</P>
<P>
	``Very cool,'' said Medin. ``I hope you'll share.''

<HEADLINE> Military Call-Up in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUANDA, Angola (AP) -- Hundreds of young men lined up outside  
government offices Tuesday to register for compulsory military 
service and possible combat duty in Angola's renewed civil war. 
</P>
<P>
	Fighting between the government and UNITA rebels resumed last  
month, shattering a 1994 peace accord. The government has launched 
a widespread media campaign to warn against attempts to dodge the 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Men between the ages of 20 and 22 have one week to register with  
the authorities and receive a registration slip they must carry 
with them at all times. Those caught without it face immediate 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Registration for military service is mandatory. However, during  
implementation of the U.N.-brokered peace deal, the government 
relaxed its recruitment drive. 
</P>
<P>
	In the suburb of Samba, one of nine municipalities in the  
capital where registration was taking place, dozens of young men 
waited in the hot afternoon sun outside the town office. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said about 200 men had registered, handing over a  
photograph and their identity card to be photocopied. Officials 
slowly filled in the registration forms by hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Two men, both age 20, said they had brothers in the army and did  
not mind being called up. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to go, so we've got to go,'' they said, shrugging.  
They asked not to be identified by name. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said they did not know how many men might be  
registered over the coming week. 
</P>
<P>
	The army has about 100,000 troops, though only about 30,000 of  
them are believed to be well-trained. The rebels have an estimated 
30,000 soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1994 peace agreement halted a two-decade civil war that  
started after Angola's 1975 independence from Portugal. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the government and UNITA -- a Portuguese acronym for the  
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola -- blame each 
other for failing to comply with the deal.

<HEADLINE> New Round of Korea Peace Talks Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Negotiators started a new round of Korean peace  
talks today, hoping to finally end nearly five decades of cold war 
on the divided peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
	The North and South Korean delegations sat facing each other on  
two sides of a square of four tables. The U.S. and Chinese 
delegations, the other main combatants in the 1950-53 war, sat on 
the other sides. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim Gye Gwan, North Korean deputy foreign minister, was  
presiding as North Korea took its first turn at the chairing talks 
that began in December 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal of the talks is to establish a permanent peace to  
replace the armistice that ended the 1950-53 Korean war. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous rounds of the peace talks saw prolonged haggling on the  
procedural details of negotiations, highlighting just how long the 
way ahead was likely to be. 
</P>
<P>
	Diplomats said they hoped the meeting today would formalize an  
agreement to assign two subcommittees to handle different issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks are expected to close Friday, North Korean deputy  
delegation leader Li Gun told Korean reporters as he left 
preparatory talks Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Few details emerged from talks and a meeting of the delegations'  
deputy heads in advance of the official opening. 
</P>
<P>
	The first two rounds of talks in December 1997 and last March  
stalled over North Korean demands that the conference agree on an 
agenda -- including its demands for withdrawal of 37,000 U.S. troops 
from South Korea -- before setting up the two working groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The general talks follow the failure of the United States in  
weekend meetings with North Korea in Geneva to gain access to a 
suspected North Korean underground nuclear weapons site. 
</P>
<P>
	Those negotiations, which were expected to set the tone for the  
four-party talks, will resume next weekend.

<HEADLINE>  Jordan's King Returns Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Piloting his own plane, King Hussein safely  
landed today in Jordan's capital following six months of cancer 
treatment at the Mayo Clinic in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	PLO chief Yasser Arafat was among the tens of thousands of  
people who braved freezing rain to welcome home the king, whose 
Boeing 737 touched down at Amman's Marka Military Base without 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
	The king, in a dress shirt and tie, was beaming as he brought  
the aircraft to a halt on the tarmac, pausing a moment from the 
pilot's seat in the cockpit to peer out at the crowd welcoming him 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	Bedouin tribesmen slaughtered sheep and camels along the  
roadsides to offer their thanks for Hussein's safe arrival. 
</P>
<P>
	Hussein, who put on a dark blue suit and a red-and-white  
checkered kaffiyeh when the plane came to a halt, fell to his knees 
and prayed on a carpet set on the tarmac after departing the 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Several members of the royal family wiped tears from their eyes  
as the aircraft landed. It was escorted by U.S.-made F-16 and 
French-built Mirage jet fighters of Jordan's air force as it 
entered Jordanian airspace. 
</P>
<P>
	Yemen's president and the emir of Qatar were among about 1,000  
diplomats and other dignitaries who stood in long lines to greet 
the 63-year-old monarch, who appeared thinner but spoke animatedly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am feeling better,'' the king told reporters at the airport.  
</P>
<P>
	Government officials say Hussein has recovered fully following  
six months of chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant for 
non-Hodgkins lymphoma at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. He had 
spent the past two weeks recuperating in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	The absence was his longest from the kingdom he has ruled for 46  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Hussein and his wife, Queen Noor, accompanied by other family  
members, then drove in a royal motorcade through the streets of the 
capital to greet their countrymen, who jammed the 25-mile route. 
</P>
<P>
	Security was tight in the narrow, bustling streets of downtown  
Amman. 
</P>
<P>
	Army and police helicopters, decorated with Jordanian flags and  
welcome banners, buzzed the skies. 
</P>
<P>
	Tens of thousands of people lined Amman's streets, cheering,  
chanting, waving banners, dancing and beating drums. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials had earlier said they expected 1 million people to  
greet Hussein, but the turnout was lower, possibly due to the rainy 
weather.

<HEADLINE>  Jordan's King Returns Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Piloting his own plane, King Hussein safely  
landed today in Jordan's capital following six months of cancer 
treatment at the Mayo Clinic in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	PLO chief Yasser Arafat was among the tens of thousands of  
people who braved freezing rain to welcome home the king, whose 
Boeing 737 touched down at Amman's Marka Military Base without 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
	The king, in a dress shirt and tie, was beaming as he brought  
the aircraft to a halt on the tarmac, pausing a moment from the 
pilot's seat in the cockpit to peer out at the crowd welcoming him 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	Bedouin tribesmen slaughtered sheep and camels along the  
roadsides to offer their thanks for Hussein's safe arrival. 
</P>
<P>
	Hussein, who put on a dark blue suit and a red-and-white  
checkered kaffiyeh when the plane came to a halt, fell to his knees 
and prayed on a carpet set on the tarmac after departing the 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Several members of the royal family wiped tears from their eyes  
as the aircraft landed. It was escorted by U.S.-made F-16 and 
French-built Mirage jet fighters of Jordan's air force as it 
entered Jordanian airspace. 
</P>
<P>
	Yemen's president and the emir of Qatar were among about 1,000  
diplomats and other dignitaries who stood in long lines to greet 
the 63-year-old monarch, who appeared thinner but spoke animatedly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am feeling better,'' the king told reporters at the airport.  
</P>
<P>
	Government officials say Hussein has recovered fully following  
six months of chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant for 
non-Hodgkins lymphoma at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. He had 
spent the past two weeks recuperating in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	The absence was his longest from the kingdom he has ruled for 46  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Hussein and his wife, Queen Noor, accompanied by other family  
members, then drove in a royal motorcade through the streets of the 
capital to greet their countrymen, who jammed the 25-mile route. 
</P>
<P>
	Security was tight in the narrow, bustling streets of downtown  
Amman. 
</P>
<P>
	Army and police helicopters, decorated with Jordanian flags and  
welcome banners, buzzed the skies. 
</P>
<P>
	Tens of thousands of people lined Amman's streets, cheering,  
chanting, waving banners, dancing and beating drums. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials had earlier said they expected 1 million people to  
greet Hussein, but the turnout was lower, possibly due to the rainy 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
	``King Hussein is like a father to me, and I have to pay respect  
for him,'' said 5-year-old Mohammed Salameh, his lips trembling 
from the cold as he stood waiting to catch a glimpse of the 
monarch.

<HEADLINE> Minn. Resources Nominee Withdraws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Gov. Jesse Ventura's choice for head of  
the state's Department of Natural Resources withdrew his name today 
amid a controversy because he was twice ticketed for violating fish 
and game rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Horner, a former Navy SEAL like Ventura, told Ventura that  
his passion for the state's natural resources remain strong. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is clear, however, that when I weigh my dedication to this  
job against the toll it may take on my personal and family life, my 
family comes first,'' Horner said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura praised Horner, and expressed dismay over the  
controversy that had prompted two DNR officials to resign in 
protest. 
</P>
<P>
	``While I understand that this action may be in the best  
interest of our citizens, I continue to be disheartened by the 
intense scrutiny placed on our citizens as they enter public 
service,'' Ventura said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura's spokesman, John Wodele, said the two resignations  
weren't a big factor in Horner's departure. It was more an issue of 
whether Horner would be able to make changes at the department with 
questions looming about his character, Wodele said. He said Ventura 
didn't ask for Horner's withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Commissioner Gail Lewellan said Monday that she was  
stepping down because respect for fish and game laws must apply to 
all employees. Deputy Commissioner Ron Nargang, who planned to 
retire soon anyway, left Friday in protest after meeting with 
Horner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was hoping to stay with the DNR, assuming my philosophy of  
managing the DNR was compatible with the new commissioner,'' 
Lewellan said. ``Apparently, it isn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewellan also said Horner, a 52-year-old businessman, has given  
different versions of what happened when he received two tickets 
and a warning for violating DNR laws since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	News of Horner's violations surfaced after Ventura named him  
last week. He had been accused of fishing or hunting without 
carrying the proper license. 
</P>
<P>
	Although DNR employees can be disciplined or fired for violating  
hunting and fishing rules, Horner and Ventura, the former 
professional wrestler whose election as a third-party candidate 
stunned the nation in November, have called the violations minor. 
</P>
<P>
	DNR employees told WCCO-TV that during a department meeting  
after the violations became public, Horner minimized the violations 
and derided DNR game wardens as ``crappie cops.'' (Crappie is a 
type of fish.) 
</P>
<P>
	``Without an apology or at least some clarification, major  
clarification of his stand, yes, he should resign,'' said Tony 
Cornish, who heads the state's Conservation Officers Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Horner owns Aaron Carlson Corp., which manufactures  
architectural woodwork for commercial buildings. Like Ventura, he 
is a former Navy SEAL. The two did not know each other until after 
the election, when Horner sent in a resume to Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he has no experience in state government, Horner has an  
undergraduate degree in zoology and a master's in business. 
</P>
<P>
	The post of DNR commissioner is one of the toughest and most  
visible in Minnesota, where residents care passionately about 
fishing, hunting and outdoor sports. The appointment must be 
confirmed by the state Senate, but such approval is usually a 
formality. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked today if she would try to return to her job, Lewellan  
said, ``I'm still dealing with having lost my job. I'm not going to 
say anything about what I'm going to do next.'' Nargang said he 
would not try for his job back.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was slightly lower against the yen early  
Wednesday amid a dearth of major market-moving news. Japanese 
stocks advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 113.52 yen in early trading, down 0.52 yen  
from late Tuesday in Tokyo but slightly above its level of 113.49 
yen in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average rose 27.56 points, or 0.20 percent, to  
13,798.00 in the first 30 minutes of trading. On Tuesday, the 
average closed down 34.62 points, or 0.25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, Asian investors selling yen to buy  
dollars, nudged the U.S. currency higher from its New York levels, 
though trading remained sluggish. 
</P>
<P>
	The main focus for the dollar continued to be the situation in  
Brazil, movements on Wall Street and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan's testimony before Congress later Wednesday, traders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices started slightly higher  
despite a lack of market-moving news. Sentiment remained bearish on 
skepticism about the economy's chances of moving onto a recovery 
path this year, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank shares were mixed but mostly higher after more indications  
of consolidation within Japan's banking industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's Mitsui Trust and Banking Co. and Chuo Trust and Banking  
Co. said Tuesday they will begin negotiations on a merger to form 
the nation's largest trust bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal comes as Japanese banks struggle to dispose of  
mountains of bad loans left from the collapse of property prices in 
the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section gained 1.68 points, or 0.16 percent, to 1,076.48. The 
TOPIX closed down 0.99 points, or 0.09 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond  
fell to 1.860 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.765 percent, 
driving its price up to 99.51 yen from 99.47 yen.

<HEADLINE> Serb Forces Pound Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PETROVO, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serb forces pounded the hills  
surrounding a village where civilians were massacred, ignoring 
demands by NATO and the United States to honor a three-month-old 
cease-fire in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The continued shelling indicated the government was not  
softening its hard-line campaign against the ethnic Albanian Kosovo 
Liberation Army, which is seeking independence from Serbia, the 
main Yugoslav republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Two top NATO generals were en route to Belgrade and were  
expected to warn Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic of possible 
NATO strikes unless he abides by terms of the Oct. 12 agreement 
intended to end fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	In a series of provocative moves Monday, the Serb-led government  
ordered the American head of the international peace verification 
mission to leave the country within 48 hours and barred the chief 
U.N. war crimes prosecutor from entering Kosovo to investigate the 
massacre of 45 ethnic Albanians in the village of Racak. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelling in the Racak area, about 20 miles southwest of  
Pristina, drove an estimated 3,500 civilians into the hills and 
forests on Monday. Ruzhdi Jashari, a local Kosovo Albanian 
activist, said most of those fleeing lacked shelter and were 
suffering from cold and hunger. 
</P>
<P>
	Near Petrovo, a recently shelled village close to Racak,  
refugees huddled in front of two lean-tos made of sticks and straw 
and partially covered with plastic sheeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Nurije Hysenaj, 61, said dozens sleep inside, sharing a space of  
two square yards and warmed by a small wood-burning stove. 
</P>
<P>
	``They will kill us ... and nobody is doing anything to stop  
this bloodshed,'' she told a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said Monday that Gen.  
Wesley Clark, supreme allied commander in Europe, and German Gen. 
Klaus Naumann would demand that Milosevic bring to justice those 
responsible for the massacre in Racak. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Milosevic will be  
making a ``grave mistake'' if he does not abide by the commitments 
he made during talks last October with U.S. envoy Richard 
Holbrooke. 
</P>
<P>
	The generals were to have gone to Belgrade on Monday, but  
delayed the visit after Yugoslav authorities said Milosevic was too 
busy to see them. 
</P>
<P>
	Belgrade's tough stand follows increasing calls by Kosovo's Serb  
minority and Milosevic's ultra-nationalist allies for the 
government to crush the Kosovo Liberation Army. Ethnic Albanians 
form 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million people, and most want 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, it was uncertain whether all key NATO members would  
support military action. Germany's defense minister, Rudolf 
Scharping, said he was not ready to abandon diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Tensions rose dramatically Saturday after international  
verifiers found the bodies of the ethnic Albanians, including three 
women and a 12-year-old boy, in a gully near Racak. 
</P>
<P>
	William Walker, the American head of the international peace  
verification mission, accused Serb police of the massacre, despite 
government claims the dead were guerrillas killed in combat. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yugoslav government, in a statement distributed by its  
Tanjug news agency, declared Monday that Walker's comments were in 
``flagrant violation of the agreement made'' with the OSCE, which 
oversees the October agreement. The government ordered Walker to 
leave Yugoslavia within 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	In Brussels, Belgium, NATO spokesman Jamie Shea called the  
expulsion order ``outrageous.'' He told BBC-TV he hoped Yugoslav 
authorities would ``come to their senses and reconsider this unwise 
decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The move against Walker appeared to be part of a Yugoslav  
program of defiance. Earlier Monday, Yugoslav guards at the 
Macedonian border turned back U.N. war crimes prosecutor Louise 
Arbour when she tried to cross into Kosovo to investigate the 
massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. Security Council held an emergency meeting Monday to  
discuss the massacre. But China and Russia, both veto-wielding 
permanent members, oppose military moves against Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations insists its court in The Hague has  
jurisdiction throughout the former Yugoslavia, including Kosovo. In 
a statement Monday, the Yugoslav government said the U.N. court 
``does not have and cannot have jurisdiction in Kosovo'' since the 
conflict is ``a clear matter of terrorism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO threatened airstrikes last year to pressure Milosevic to  
call off his offensive against ethnic Albanian rebels and begin 
talks with the ethnic Albanians on Kosovo's future. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides, however, have rejected U.S. proposals for expanded  
self-rule for Kosovo. With diplomacy at a stalemate, prospects of a 
full-scale resumption of fighting have increased.

<HEADLINE> Joe DiMaggio Released From Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) -- Once comatose and near death from a  
persistent lung infection, Joe DiMaggio has gone home to work on 
his recovery -- and his pitching. 
</P>
<P>
	The 84-year-old baseball great was released Monday from Memorial  
Regional Hospital, where he had spent more than three months. He 
hopes to visit Yankee Stadium in New York to throw out the season's 
opening pitch April 9. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. DiMaggio wishes to express his thanks to the doctors, ICU  
nurses and staff at Memorial Regional Hospital for helping him 
recover from infectious pneumonia, as well as to the 250 million 
people out there who are praying for him,'' his lawyer, Morris 
Engelberg, said in a statement Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. DiMaggio is looking forward to opening day in Yankee  
Stadium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner visited DiMaggio in  
early January. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe will certainly toss out the first ball,'' Steinbrenner  
said Monday. ``It's a wonderful moment for me personally and for 
the fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hospital officials and DiMaggio's doctor's office refused to  
discuss his condition at the time of his discharge. Engelberg's 
statement did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio entered the intensive care unit on Oct. 12 and spent 99  
days there. He reportedly will have 24-hour nursing at his home in 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio had a cancerous tumor removed from his right lung two  
days after he was admitted. He had recurring pneumonia in his left 
lung despite treatment with three antibiotics, and had fluid 
drained from his lungs several times. 
</P>
<P>
	He slipped into a coma last month, prompting cardiologist Dr.  
Earl Barron to give him a slim chance of survival. When DiMaggio 
came out of the coma, his first order of business was to admonish 
his doctor for providing public updates on his condition. His 
privacy was more cherished than ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Not surprisingly, details of his hospital release were terse.  
Some hospital staff weren't even aware he had been discharged. The 
Daily News in New York reported that his granddaughters, Paula and 
Cathy, were at his bedside at his home. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio's last public appearance was Sept. 27, when he was  
honored at Yankee Stadium and received replicas of nine 
championship rings that were stolen from his hotel room three 
decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees had wanted him to throw out the ceremonial first  
pitch at the World Series, but by then he was in the hospital just 
north of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	He celebrated his 84th birthday in the hospital on Nov. 25,  
surrounded by family. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak in 1941 is still considered  
one of the greatest feats in all sports. 
</P>
<P>
	He was voted into the Hall of Fame in 1955, four years after his  
retirement, and in 1969 was chosen as the greatest living baseball 
player. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio played in 11 All-Star games and 10 World Series in 13  
seasons with the Yankees. He batted .325 with 361 home runs, was a 
two-time batting champion and a three-time most valuable player.

<HEADLINE> Gore Visits Tornado-Torn Neighborhood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Tenn. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore visited his  
mother's old hometown today, offering support and promises of aid 
to victims of tornadoes that killed eight people. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to bring a lot of help in here, we're going to  
help you rebuild,'' Gore promised a shook-up Peggy Turner, 65, as 
residents in a heavily damaged neighborhood around South Side High 
School picked through what was left of their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president, who began the day with Gov. Don Sundquist,  
Lt. Gov. John Wilder and Tennessee House Speaker Jimmy Naifeh, 
planned to tour other neighborhoods and meet with hospitalized 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tennessee Emergency Managment Agency said damage was  
reported in 28 counties. Gore announced today that 12 counties have 
been declared federal disaster areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's 86-year-old mother, Pauline, was born in Palmersville but  
her family moved to Jackson when she was young and she spent much 
of her childhood there. 
</P>
<P>
	In Bemis, just south of Jackson, a teary-eyed and shaking Shelby  
Phifer climbed over the heap of bricks and glass that was once her 
living room Monday, past the shattered fish tank and overturned 
furniture, until she found what she was looking for. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pictures -- pictures of my babies,'' she said, pulling  
ragged portraits out from under glass. ``Everything else can be 
replaced. All I want is the pictures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She, her husband and their three children had crammed into their  
home's shower stall as the storm blew through. 
</P>
<P>
	The Phifers waited until it was safe and climbed out a bedroom  
window into the dark and went to a shelter. They were hardly 
prepared for the scene daylight brought. 
</P>
<P>
	The front and back rooms of their two-story brick home were  
gone. So was most of the roof. Five-year-old daughter Page's room 
was open to the sky, little dresses fluttering in the wind. 
</P>
<P>
	In every direction, the devastation seemed worse: a washing  
machine wrapped around a tree, crushed cars and Christmas 
decorations strewn along the street. 
</P>
<P>
	Six people in the Jackson area died, including a woman in her  
30s and her 10-year-old daughter. A 72-year-old woman died in 
nearby Henderson County and a 41-year-old woman was killed in 
Hardeman County. 
</P>
<P>
	Wrecked cars and trucks dotted the wind-swept landscape around  
Jackson while twisted metal, broken boards and clumps of insulation 
hung from broken trees and power lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Jordan said he was lifted off the floor by the swirling  
winds as he struggled frantically to hold onto his 7-year-old son, 
Logan, by one of his arms. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I was going to lose him,'' he said. ``But I wasn't  
going to let go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Logan was apparently hit in the head by storm debris, but  
doctors said the boy's skull fracture would heal with no permanent 
damage. ``He's going to be OK,'' Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
	A few miles away, Jean Newell surveyed the shambles the tornado  
had left of her home -- all that remained was the tiny corner of the 
bathroom where she had ridden out the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just as quick as I slammed the bathroom door, everything just  
fell apart,'' Newell said. It took rescuers half an hour to dig her 
out from the debris. ``It was right after me. It was right on my 
heels. I was running for dear life for that door.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Tenn. (AP) -- When Vice President Al Gore asked an  
injured teen-ager on Tuesday how her family fared when a tornado 
demolished their home, he was stunned by her reply. 
</P>
<P>
	``My father didn't make it,'' Jamie Thomas, 18, said from a  
wheelchair at Jackson-Madison County General Hospital, where she 
was being treated for a broken neck.

	Gore then leaned forward, patted her hand and whispered he was  
sorry. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, following a tour of a tornado-ravaged neighborhood in  
the city where his mother lived as a child, Gore marveled at the 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was amazed,'' he said. ``The power of this tornado is very  
humbling to anyone who walks in its wake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tornado was part of a storm system that walloped parts of  
western and central Tennessee on Sunday evening. Eight people were 
killed -- including Miss Thomas' father, Terry Thomas, 43 -- and at 
least 100 injured, and about 1,900 homes and businesses were 
damaged or destroyed, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore announced a dozen counties have been declared federal  
disaster areas. Residents are eligible for federal loans and grants 
to repair tornado damage. 
</P>
<P>
	During a walk down a road lined by damaged houses, broken trees  
and downed power lines, heard the tale of Peggy Turner, 65, who 
grabbed her son, Terry Elkins, around the waist and held on as the 
winds tore the roof from their house. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `Mama, what are you doing?' `I said if it takes you,  
it's gonna take me, too,''' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bless your heart,'' Gore said.

<HEADLINE> Governors Say States Are In Good Shape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's governors say the state of their  
states is great, especially in comparison with the ugly state of 
affairs in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	With polls showing Americans weary of the impeachment  
proceedings, Republican and Democratic governors alike are using 
their annual State of the State addresses to hold their 
administrations up as models of get-alongsmanship. 
</P>
<P>
	``These may be dark days in our nation's capital, but not in  
Connecticut's capital,'' Republican Gov. John Rowland told 
assembled legislators Jan. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time Clinton delivers his State of the Union address  
Tuesday night to a congressional audience that will include House 
prosecutors and Senate jurors, about half the governors will have 
presented their annual reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as the president will Tuesday, governors are taking credit  
for more jobs, fewer crimes and less unemployment than this time 
last year. And the governors, like Clinton, are unveiling plans to 
create better schools, improve health care and fight crime. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is no comparison in their working conditions. The  
state of state politics is less rancorous than in Washington, 
governors say. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have taken pride in the notion that all of Vermont is one  
community and that our political disagreements need not take on the 
partisan tone of the debate in our nation's capital,'' Democratic 
Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont said in his Jan. 7 address. 
</P>
<P>
	``Recent national events have caused some to doubt  
representative democracy,'' Democratic Gov. Frank O'Bannon of 
Indiana said on Jan. 12. ``Much of the work we do in this Hoosier 
capitol could restore their faith.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a series of interviews, several governors said state  
politicians are driven less by ideology than their Washington 
counterparts are. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have that luxury,'' Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee said.  
``We have to work with our political opponents and walk their 
neighborhoods.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A fellow Republican, Gov. Ed Schafer of North Dakota, said, ``We  
get in political fights here in North Dakota, then we go off and 
have lunch together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Operatives in both parties say the governors are simply telling  
voters what they want to hear. Only in comparison with a 
presidential impeachment trial are state politics tame. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is all wishful thinking,'' said Democratic  
consultant Dane Strother, who helped elect Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes 
in November. ``Deep down, nobody wants divisiveness but that's what 
politics is all about. Politics is about choosing A or B, and 
framing the debate in a way that favors your position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A look at the agendas offered by Democratic and Republican  
governors this month suggests that they're at least willing to 
share ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	Several chief executives, including Rowland, O'Bannon and  
Republican Gov. George Bush of Texas, offered programs to get 
children reading earlier. Schools are a top priority from coast to 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
	``My first priority -- in fact, my first, second and third  
priority -- is education,'' declared Democratic Gov. Gray Davis on 
Jan. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	With their economies booming, most governors are offering some  
sort of tax relief. New York Gov. George Pataki, a potential GOP 
presidential nominee, promised to place $1 billion of surplus cash 
in reserve to protect tax cuts he has already signed into law. 
</P>
<P>
	States have already cut taxes by at least $7 billion in the  
current fiscal year and by a total of $22 billion in the last five 
years, according to the National Governors Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``Someone once said that taxes are a necessary evil,'' Pataki  
said in his Jan. 6 State of the State address. ``They were half 
right. By cutting taxes as much as we have, we've shown that much 
of this government's taxing wasn't necessary at all.''

<HEADLINE> Super Letdown for Vikings' Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- Another year, another heartache in  
Minnesota. Only this might be the biggest one of all. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings' shocking loss to Atlanta in the NFC championship  
game stung the organization at least as deeply as any 
disappointment in its first 37 seasons, including those four Super 
Bowl losses in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	It has been 22 years since the last of those Super setbacks, and  
this team was the one that was supposed to make up for those years 
of frustration. Instead, it just tossed another one on the pile. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to swallow, more than anything else,'' defensive end  
Derrick Alexander said Monday as the Vikings packed up their 
belongings in a somber locker room. ``The expectations for the 
entire team were to go so far and do so many great things, and to 
fall short of that is very disappointing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday afternoon's crushing 30-27 overtime loss at home to the  
Falcons led to a near-sleepless night for many of the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	Nose tackle Jerry Ball spent much of night staring out the  
window of his downtown Minneapolis hotel room as a heavy, wet snow 
fell on the city, wondering what went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Anderson barely slept after missing a 38-yard field goal --  
his first miss in more than a year -- that could have clinched the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Randall Cunningham was up until 4 a.m. after leading the  
highest-scoring offense in NFL history to just seven points after 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point in time, it's just such an abrupt stoppage, you  
can't think clearly,'' tight end Andrew Glover said. ``It was hard 
to sleep, it's hard to really believe it was happening. It all 
seemed like a dream, a bad dream at that. But it's reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't supposed to end like this, not this soon.  
</P>
<P>
	No defense was supposed to be able to stop Minnesota's explosive  
offense. Atlanta did after falling behind 20-7 late in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	No offense was supposed to be able to function properly in the  
din of a Metrodome filled with 64,060 wild fans, the largest crowd 
ever to see a playoff game in Minnesota. The Falcons did. 
</P>
<P>
	No team was supposed to keep the Vikings from a Jan. 31 date in  
Miami with the AFC champions. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're going to keep replaying plays that you could have made  
and situations. And it's gone,'' said safety Robert Griffith, who 
dropped a diving interception attempt on the play before Atlanta's 
tying touchdown with 49 seconds left in regulation. ``That's just 
the way we're built. There's nothing we can do about it now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After going 11 years without even reaching the conference title  
game, the Vikings felt they had assembled a team capable of winning 
their first Super Bowl. Their 15-1 regular-season record and 
NFL-record 556 points seemed to prove they were right. 
</P>
<P>
	They routed Arizona -- just business as usual -- in the divisional  
playoffs and then jumped to a 13-point lead late in the first half 
Sunday. The lead still was 10 with just over 13 minutes remaining 
in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami seemed just a plane ride away.  
</P>
<P>
	``You get to the championship game and you really feel you're on  
your way to the Super Bowl and it ends the way it did, so abruptly, 
it's the most devastating emotional thing you have to deal with as 
a coach,'' said offensive coordinator Brian Billick, who flew to 
Baltimore on Monday to interview for a head coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
	The day perhaps was hardest for Anderson, the 17-year veteran  
who never has been to a Super Bowl despite four trips to the 
conference final (two with Pittsburgh and last season with San 
Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson had kicked 46 consecutive field goals when he lined up  
for a 38-yarder late in the fourth quarter. He had made all 106 of 
his kicks this season, including extra points. 
</P>
<P>
	But he pushed this one barely wide of the left upright with 2:07  
left, keeping the Vikings' lead at 27-20 and allowing Atlanta a 
chance it grasped. 
</P>
<P>
	Tears welled in Anderson's eyes Monday as he recalled meeting  
his 9-year-old son, Austin, after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first I saw him he came over and gave me a big hug and  
reminded me of one of the lessons that I try to teach him all the 
time,'' Anderson said. ``He said, `Well, Dad. You tell me all the 
time you can't make 'em all.' It was a hard way to learn that 
lesson myself. 
</P>
<P>
	``That certainly hit home.''

                           *Harvey Miller    	
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Television comedy writer Harvey Miller, who  
won an Oscar nomination for the screenplay ``Private Benjamin,'' 
died Jan. 8 of heart failure. He was 63. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller's film, television and stage career started in the 1960s.  
On the side, he started writing and selling material to standup 
comics, including Dick Gregory, Shecky Greene, Alan King and Sandy 
Baron. 
</P>
<P>
	Baron brought Miller with him to Hollywood in 1967 to work on  
the television series ``Hey Landlord!'' Through that show, Miller 
met the writer-producer team of Jerry Belson and Garry Marshall, 
building a relationship that would last through several television 
shows over many years. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller wrote, produced and directed ``The Odd Couple'' in 1973,  
for which he was nominated for two Emmy Awards. He was also 
nominated for an Emmy for work on ``Love, American Style.'' Other 
television credits include writing and directing ``Taxi'' and ``The 
Tracey Ullman Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller was co-author of ``Private Benjamin,'' which starred  
Goldie Hawn. In 1980, the screenplay was named the year's best by 
the Writers Guild of America, and was later nominated for an Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Miller opened a one-man show called ``A Cheap Date With  
Harvey Miller'' at the Court Theatre in Los Angeles. The show had 
been scheduled for an off-Broadway run in the spring.

</P>
<P>
	FAIRBANKS, Alaska (AP) -- Edgar Nollner Sr., the last survivor of  
a desperate 1925 dog team relay that carried diphtheria serum to 
Nome, died Monday in the Yukon River village of Galena. He was 94. 
</P>
<P>
	The serum relay inspired the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, an  
annual 1,100-mile run from Anchorage to Nome that began in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	Nollner was 20 when he hooked up his seven dogs, loaded the  
serum into his sled and mushed 24 miles in bitter cold from Whiskey 
Creek to Galena on the Yukon River. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 10th of 20 mushers who relayed the serum in a record 5 1/2  
days. It usually took about 30 days for a single team to make the 
674-mile journey from Nenana to Nome. 
</P>
<P>
	Nollner was born Nov. 11, 1904, at Old Louden, about 12 miles  
upriver from Galena. He was a trapper, fisherman, barge pilot and 
woodcutter. With two wives -- both of whom he outlived -- he had 23 
children. Family members estimate he has about 200 grandchildren.

<P>
                           *Hanna Sulner    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hanna Sulner, a handwriting expert who was roped  
into helping Hungarian Communists frame Jozsef Cardinal Mindszenty 
on treason charges in 1949, died Jan. 5. She was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Sulner fled to the West soon after the Mindszenty frame-up  
and exposed the plot. Since 1950 she had lived in New York as one 
of the country's top authorities on disputed documents. She wrote 
the 1966 handbook ``Disputed Documents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mindszenty was a celebrity opponent of the Communist takeover of  
Hungary in 1948, a time when other opponents were summarily shot or 
jailed. 
</P>
<P>
	Sulner and her husband were enlisted -- under threat of death --  
to forge Mindszenty's handwriting and signature on documents used 
to publicly discredit him and frame him on treason charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Mindszenty was convicted after a three-day trial in February  
1949. The Sulners, after escaping to Austria, denounced the trial 
as a sham.

</P>
<P>
	HUDSON, Wis. (AP) -- Thomas Zosel, an engineer credited with  
preventing at least 1.5 billion pounds of pollutants from being 
produced at 3M, died Saturday at age 55. 
</P>
<P>
	As manager of environmental initiatives in 3M's Corporate  
Environmental Technology and Safety Services organization, Zosel 
was responsible in part for improving the company's environmental 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maplewood-based Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing said he  
was best known for initiating 3M's Pollution Prevention Pays 
Program, which changes products and manufacturing processes to 
eliminate sources of pollution. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of his death, Zosel was serving on the Clean Air Act  
Advisory Committee of the EPA. He was past chair of the American 
Institute of Chemical Engineers Center for Waste Reduction 
Technologies, and chair of the National Pollution Prevention Center 
Advisory Board.

<HEADLINE> Meola Returns U.S. Soccer Roster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Goalkeeper Tony Meola, who hasn't played  
for the United States since the 1994 World Cup, was among 18 
players selected Tuesday for this weekend's exhibition game at 
Bolivia. 
</P>
<P>
	Meola, 29, has been the starter for the New York/New Jersey  
MetroStars in Major League Soccer the past three years. He was left 
off the team for last summer's World Cup in France in favor of 
Kasey Keller, who starts for Leicester City in England's Premier 
League, and Brad Friedel, who plays for Liverpool. 
</P>
<P>
	``Meola has justified his call up to the national team,'' said  
new U.S. coach Bruce Arena, once Meola's coach at the University of 
Virginia. ``He's brought a great attitude to the camp. ... You can 
see the difference in his experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meola has played 87 times for the United States but not at all  
since July 4, 1994, when the Americans were eliminated from the 
World Cup with a 1-0 loss to Brazil at Stanford, Calif. He then 
left soccer to try out for the New York Jets and act in an 
off-Broadway show but returned when MLS started play in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Under former coach Steve Sampson, Meola joined the national team  
just once, for a training camp last January before an exhibition 
game against Sweden, but Sampson decided in the days before the 
game to recall Friedel from Liverpool. 
</P>
<P>
	Arena has coached just one game with the national team, a  
scoreless tie against Australia on Nov. 6. He is taking a mixture 
of veterans and young players to Sunday's game at Santa Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
	Just five players selected were on the team for last summer's  
last-place finish among the 32 nations at the World Cup in France: 
defenders Jeff Agoos and Eddie Pope, midfielders Cobi Jones and 
Claudio Reyna and forward Joe-Max Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	With 111 international appearances, Jones is the veteran on the  
roster. Eight players have fewer than five international 
appearances and four are from D.C. United, the team Arena coached 
in MLS before joining the national team. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, 0-2-3 against Bolivia, returns home next week  
for a Feb. 6 exhibition game against Germany at Jacksonville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	The full roster (teams are MLS unless noted):  
</P>
<P>
	Goalkeepers--Tony Meola (New York/New Jersey), Tom Presthus  
(D.C.) 
</P>
<P>
	Defenders--Jeff Agoos (D.C.), Gregg Berhalter (Cambuur  
Leeuwarden, Netherlands), C.J. Brown (Chicago), Robin Fraser (Los 
Angeles), Eddie Pope (D.C.), Richie Williams (D.C.) 
</P>
<P>
	Midfielders--Chris Armas (Chicago), Imad Baba (New England), Cobi  
Jones (Los Angeles), Eddie Lewis (San Jose), Clint Mathis (Los 
Angeles), Claudio Reyna (VfL Wolfsburg, Germany) 
</P>
<P>
	Forwards--Jovan Kirovski (Fortuna Cologne, Germany), Roy Lassier  
(D.C.), Brian McBride (Columbus), Joe-Max Moore (New England)

arbitration with the Los Angeles Dodgers by agreeing to a $1.9 
million, one-year contract with the team Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dreifort, a 26-year-old right-hander, earned $685,000 last  
season, when he went 8-12 with a 4.00 ERA. He appeared in 32 for 
the Dodgers, 26 of them starts, with one complete game. He struck 
out 168 batters in 180 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	The signing left shortstop Mark Grudzielanek as the only Dodgers  
player in arbitration. Grudzielanek has asked for $2.6 million and 
the Dodgers have offered $1.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Grudzielanek, 28, earned $350,000 last season, when he hit .272  
with 10 homers and 62 RBIs while playing in 156 games. He played in 
105 games for the Montreal Expos and 51 for the Dodgers.

<HEADLINE> Rocker Tommy Lee Must Go to Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MALIBU, Calif. (AP) -- Rocker Tommy Lee must go to court Feb. 4  
to answer allegations that he used alcohol, a violation of his 
probation for spousal abuse that could land him in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Lawrence Mira, who warned Lee eight months ago that a  
slip-up could send him to prison for three years, set the hearing 
date Tuesday after learning through news reports that the Motley 
Crue drummer was allegedly drinking recently with bandmates in 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee served about four months in jail after he pleaded no contest  
to kicking his estranged wife, former ``Baywatch'' star Pamela 
Anderson Lee, while she held their son, Dylan, in February 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Mira ordered Lee to stay away from alcohol and drugs. Lee also  
had to donate $5,000 to a battered women's shelter, stay at least 
100 yards away from his estranged wife, attend anger management

<HEADLINE> White House To Open Clinton Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Opening President Clinton's trial defense,  
White House lawyers today added congressional Democrats to their 
team to bolster arguments that his impeachment was handled in a 
``very partisan way.'' The Senate Republican leader rejected 
Democratic suggestions that calling witnesses would turn the trial 
into a lurid show. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it should lead to an unseemly spectacle. You  
don't have to get into the details,'' said Majority Leader Trent 
Lott. He said he hadn't made a final decision on recommending 
witnesses, calling it ``premature'' to do so before the White House 
made its opening arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	The tactical move by the White House came on an extraordinary  
day in which Clinton was both opening his defense at the first 
presidential trial in 131 years and also delivering the State of 
the Union address to a Congress that has impeached him. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said today that some  
Democratic members of the House Judiciary Committee will join 
Clinton's defense team, along with former Sen. Dale Bumpers of 
Arkansas, a longtime ally of the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart declined to name the House Democrats or say how many  
are involved. He said they were joining the team at the White House 
request to ``offer some valuable insight into how we got to this 
point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity,  
said the White House was interested in having Reps. John Conyers of 
Michigan, Rick Boucher of Virginia and Tom Barrett of Wisconsin 
join the team. Each would speak before the Senate as part of the 
president's defense. 
</P>
<P>
	All three are members of the Judiciary Committee, where  
Democrats battled Republicans to the end in opposition to the 
articles of impeachment that eventually cleared the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	LockhartHe said the lawmakers would make presentations during  
the opening arguments to explain how the impeachment effort ``moved 
forward in a very partisan way, and in a way that was not fair to 
the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House team also was to focus on conflicts in testimony  
gathered by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, a shift in strategy 
aimed at undercutting House charges of perjury and obstruction of 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
	This will be the second year that Clinton's State of the Union  
address has been clouded by charges of marital infidelities. He 
presented his 1998 speech a few days after the Monica Lewinsky 
story was made public. 
</P>
<P>
	At his trial, meanwhile, the switch from not discussing the  
facts to disputing many of them could bolster Republican demands 
for witnesses to help resolve the disputes. The White House has 
been fighting that prospect but now expects witnesses, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, John Podesta, the White House chief of staff, said  
today there is no assurance that witnesses could resolve whatever 
conflicts might exist in testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think after our defense team has put down the case on the  
facts, the law and the Constitution, have reminded the senators 
there are 60,000 pages of testimony from over 100 witnesses that 
are before them already, they may find there is no need for 
witnesses,'' Podesta said on NBC's ``Today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Clinton's lawyers conclude their arguments, he said, they  
will move to dismiss the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle said Monday that witnesses  
might be inevitable. In an interview with The Associated Press, the 
South Dakota Democrat said witnesses could lead to the spectacle of 
100 senators watching former Ms. Lewinsky, the former White House 
intern, ``point to where the president touched her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., dismissed Daschle's warning as  
``all-or-nothing'' scare tactics that are ``just not true.'' Lott 
seconded Kyl's opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	House GOP prosecutors on Saturday finished a three-day  
presentation of their case in support of two articles of 
impeachment that were approved Dec. 19 on mostly partisan votes. 
The White House will get 24 hours to present its rebuttal. White 
House Counsel Charles F.C. Ruff was to spend several hours 
presenting opening defense arguments today before the trial 
recesses for Clinton's State of the Union address in the House 
chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	After the White House finishes its presentation, the Senate will  
submit questions in writing to both sides, to be read by Chief 
Justice William Rehnquist as presiding trial officer. 
</P>
<P>
	One area of White House attack is witness testimony in regard to  
the alleged obstruction of justice. Ms. Lewinsky says she got a 
call from Clinton's secretary, Betty Currie, arranging to pick up 
gifts from the president a few hours after Ms. Lewinsky told 
Clinton of her concern that she'd have to turn over the presents to 
lawyers in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit against the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mrs. Currie says she thinks it was Ms. Lewinsky who  
initiated the gift return and Mrs. Currie has testified that she 
has no recollection of ever talking to Clinton about returning the 
gifts, before or after she picked them up. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton legal team credits Mrs. Currie's account, while  
noting that both witnesses testified that the president did not ask 
Ms. Lewinsky to surrender the gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	Such back-and-forth forms the backdrop for Clinton's address  
tonight, when bitter political enemies crowd onto the House floor 
as the president, his legacy already soiled by impeachment, lays 
out his agenda for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders have advised their rank and file to give him a  
courteous, but restrained, reception. Senate Republican aides who 
asked not to be identified said GOP leaders were quietly spreading 
the word that senators should adopt the demeanor of Supreme Court 
justices who will attend and not express themselves during the 
address. 
</P>
<P>
	Absent will be House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde,  
who said he prefers to avoid crowds.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Boost Social Security Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will propose in his State of  
the Union address tonight spending most of the government budget 
surplus to bolster Social Security and create new 401(k)-style 
retirement accounts for most American workers. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time, some of the money in Social Security cash  
reserves would be invested by the government in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a bold approach to save Social Security now,'' said White  
House press secretary Joe Lockhart. ``You remember last year was to 
`save Social Security first.' It's moved to now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president also will call for using some of the budget  
surplus to support the ailing Medicare system and spending another 
11 percent for military and domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's proposal includes no income tax cuts and thus is  
certain to set up conflicts with many Republicans who want the 
budget surplus spent, at least in part, to reduce taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional Republicans placed Social Security atop their own  
agenda for the new Congress. At a news conference, Senate Majority 
Leader Trent Lott said the GOP was committed to saving the giant 
pension program without raising taxes or cutting benefits for 
current recipients. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the first bill to be introduced in the Senate this year  
would be reserved for the subject, and it would be left blank until 
March in hopes the White House would submit a formal proposal. 
House and Senate committees will hold a joint hearing on the 
subject in March, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's proposals would commit more than $4 trillion in budget  
surpluses expected by the federal government over the next 15 
years. The surpluses are the result of spending curbs lawmakers set 
in the 1997 balanced-budget act and tax revenue flowing from the 
healthy U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will suggest using about 62 percent of the extra money --  
or more than $2.7 trillion -- to directly bolster Social Security's 
cash reserves. Another 11 percent, or $500 billion, would go to the 
new government-subsidized retirement savings accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 15 percent of the surplus would go to strengthen  
Medicare, the nation's health insurance program for the elderly and 
disabled, which like Social Security is expected to be financially 
overburdened by the huge, aging baby boom generation. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the surplus -- about 11 percent -- Clinton wants for  
other spending, including military readiness and domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House estimates the spending would keep Social  
Security solvent through 2055 and Medicare through 2020. Clinton 
also will suggest that other structural changes may be needed, but 
he would leave those choices, which could include painful choices 
such as raising the retirement age, to be decided through 
bipartisan negotiations with Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House proposal answers Republican congressional  
leaders' demands for Clinton to specify how he wants to see 
surpluses spent, but could continue to thwart the major tax cuts 
many GOP lawmakers want. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has been trying to come up with a plan that could appeal  
to both parties, Sperling said. 
</P>
<P>
	Using part of the surplus to help Americans build savings to  
supplement Social Security is something GOP chairmen in the House 
and Senate have proposed. Democratic leaders have said they could 
live with it, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan Clinton intends to outline tonight, 60 percent of  
the expected surplus would be used to add to Social Security's cash 
reserves. Of that, Clinton will propose about one-fourth should be 
invested, in bulk by an independent government board, in the stock 
market in hopes of increasing its value. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Republicans strongly oppose government-controlled  
investment of Social Security money, citing the risk of political 
interference in private companies. They'd prefer to see some Social 
Security taxes diverted into personal accounts that individuals 
would control. But Clinton has sided with Democrats who counter 
that would expose people to too much financial risk. 
</P>
<P>
	The president will ask Congress to help him devise a way that  
bulk investment decisions could be made by a board insulated from 
politics and limited to options such as stock index funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the Social Security cash infusion would be kept -- as  
the program's cash reserves have been traditionally -- in safer, but 
historically lower-yielding U.S. Treasury bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Clinton administration officials predict, Social  
Security would be prevented from running short of cash until about 
2055 -- more than 20 years longer than now expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton would be willing to discuss using the remaining budget  
surpluses only after Social Security is shored up. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, he would ask that another 11 percent of the money go to  
subsidize new Individual Retirement Accounts -- dubbed Universal 
Saving Accounts -- to supplement Social Security benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The accounts would work something like the 401(k) savings plans  
many companies offer, allowing workers to choose among several 
investment options such as stock and bond funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The government would make an annual lump-sum contribution to  
individual accounts, then match workers' own contributions up to a 
limit. The president would want a sliding scale for the matching 
dollars to give bigger subsidies to those with lower incomes, and 
might disqualify the wealthiest -- perhaps the top 5 percent -- from 
the money altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	As a hypothetical example, Sperling said a worker earning  
$45,000 a year might get an initial government payment of $100, 
then a 50 percent government match of his or her own contributions 
up to a maximum of $600. The result would be $1,000 in the worker's 
account at year's end, with $400 of that from the government. 
</P>
<P>
	The portion of the surplus going to Medicare -- about $650  
billion to $700 billion -- would push back the date that program is 
expected to run short of money from 2008 to about 2020, 
administration officials estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will suggest that with additional, structural reforms to  
Social Security and Medicare, the money could go even further. 
</P>
<P>
	The president will ask lawmakers to strive to keep both programs  
fully funded until 2075, to add a Medicare prescription drug 
benefit and provide additional help to single elderly women, now 
the poorest retirees.

<HEADLINE> Bulk Wine Prices Soaring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ROSA, Calif. (AP) -- Strong holiday wine sales are  
dispelling industry fears that Sonoma and Napa vintners raised 
prices too high, said Ed Everett, president of New World Wines, a 
San Francisco wine distributor and consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite fears of a slowdown, they all seemed to have one  
fabulous holiday season,'' Everett said. ``There is no sign of a 
slowdown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A skimpy 1998 grape harvest combined with strong retail sales  
during the holidays have sent bulk wine prices soaring 
</P>
<P>
	The price of bulk wine in Sonoma and Napa counties is up 10 to  
25 percent this year, depending on the varietal, said Bill 
Turrentine, a San Anselmo wine broker. Bulk wine prices in other 
regions of California are holding steady or even rising slightly, 
no small feat after plunging roughly 50 percent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is shifting back to a seller's market,'' said Turrentine.  
``It certainly shows there is no excess of grapes or wine as we 
speak, right today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bulk wine market, where surplus wine is bought and sold by  
wineries before it is bottled, is closely watched within the 
industry as a barometer of future wine and grape prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The impact on consumers will not be known at least until spring,  
one of the peak periods for new releases by wineries. The full 
impact could take longer to measure because red wines now being 
traded on the bulk market will not be released to retailers for 
several years. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever happens, the impact will vary depending on the price of  
the wine. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, consumers already are seeing retail prices drop  
for wines listed at $8 a bottle and below, said Ben Pearson, 
general manager of the Bottle Barn in Santa Rosa. This segment is 
affected the most by mammoth vineyard developments coming into 
production in the Central Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	But retail wine prices are holding steady or rising modestly in  
the $10 to $15 range, Pearson said. And the price of top-tier wines 
is continuing to skyrocket, especially for cabernet sauvignon, 
reflecting a continuing shortage of the highest-quality red wines. 
</P>
<P>
	``The prices are better now, but not dramatically better,''  
Pearson said. ``A lot of people are holding the line, or taking 
modest increases. Red wine prices are still going up. Any big 
deals, in terms of price reductions, will be at the lower end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bulk wine prices rose to astronomical levels in early 1997 after  
small harvests in three of the previous four years. But the market 
shifted abruptly that winter after a record-breaking 1997 grape 
harvest, which was so big that many vintners had to scramble to 
find enough room in their tanks for all the grapes. 
</P>
<P>
	Grape growers then suffered unseasonable rain and cold weather  
in 1998. The result: Grape tonnage dropped 30 to 50 percent in some 
California vineyards. Now, bulk wine prices are rising again as 
wineries look for ways to meet consumer demand.

<HEADLINE> Author Surrenders on Jury Indictment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- The author of a book about conspiracy  
theories in the Oklahoma City bombing surrendered today on charges 
he attempted to influence jurors in a grand jury investigation of 
the 1995 blast. 
</P>
<P>
	David Hoffman, 38, was indicted Dec. 30, but the indictment  
remained sealed until today. As he was led away by sheriff's 
deputies, Hoffman said he was being persecuted by Oklahoma County 
District Attorney Bob Macy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bob Macy has put 53 people on death row, some of whom he knew  
to be innocent,'' Hoffman said as he was pulled inside the jail. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now he's trying to prosecute a lowly reporter for speaking the  
truth about a crime he was charged to investigate but failed to do 
so,'' Hoffman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the indictment were not immediately made public.  
Hoffman, author of ``The Oklahoma City Bombing and The Politics of 
Terror,'' had said last week that he was indicted for sending 
copies of his book and ``inspirational notes'' to jurors during 
their investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman, who runs an alternative San Francisco-based newspaper,  
the Haight-Ashbury Free Press, has said grand jury members 
complained about being coerced. He said he didn't try to contact 
jurors directly. He also said he didn't remember precisely what he 
said in the notes. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury met for 18 months. In its final report last  
month, it dismissed one after another of the theories that have 
been put forth about a larger conspiracy or a government coverup. 
Hoffman's book makes just such allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can state with assurance that we do not believe that the  
federal government had prior knowledge that this horrible terrorist 
attack was going to happen,'' grand jurors wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement distributed after his arrest by a friend, Hoffman  
accused Macy, Gov. Frank Keating and Attorney General Drew 
Edmondson of obstructing justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's who influenced and coerced the grand jury. These are  
the people who tampered with the legal process,'' Hoffman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The April 19, 1995, bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal  
Building killed 168 people. 
</P>
<P>
	``The jurors are not good people,'' Hoffman said shortly after  
he was indicted. ``If they were good people, they would have 
returned more indictments. This is the biggest government coverup 
since the Kennedy assassination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman is scheduled to be arraigned this afternoon. Hoffman has  
said he is serving a deferred sentence on an unrelated stalking 
charge and does not want the indictment to lead to a lengthy jail 
stay. Hoffman served five days in the Oklahoma County Jail on the 
stalking charge, which stemmed from his attempt to court a woman 
who spurned his attentions.

<P>
	The Kemper Open, in one of the worst spots on the PGA Tour  
schedule, has come up with an unusual incentive to attract players. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with a $500,000 purse increase to $2.5 million, tournament  
officials will try to sign the winner to a one-year deal in which 
he would get a logo fee for carrying the Kemper name somewhere on 
either his shirt or bag, plus $200,000 if he goes on to win a 
major. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange, the winner would be required to make a couple of  
promotional appearances for Kemper and allow his name to be used in 
advertising and on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason for the incentive?  
</P>
<P>
	``We think this will help us get more people here to play,''  
said Kemper tournament chairman Ben Bundred. 
</P>
<P>
	Kemper is among several tournaments that fear getting squeezed  
out by the addition of the World Golf Championship events and huge 
purse increases. The fact it is the week after Colonial and the 
week before Memorial doesn't help, especially with the U.S. Open 
right around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
	Some fear that four majors and five $5 million events could make  
tournaments like the Kemper an afterthought. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to find out,'' Bundred said. ``It scares me a  
little bit.'' 
</P>
<P>

<P>
	 *BRITISH BUMP:* With the 40 percent increase in purses on the  
PGA Tour, commissioner Tim Finchem says he anticipates the major 
championships to keep pace. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I operate a major, I don't want to be too far away'' from  
purses at other events, he said last week at the Mercedes 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	The Royal and Ancient Golf Club apparently doesn't agree.  
</P>
<P>
	The purse for this year's British Open will be about $3 million  
(1.85 million pounds), an increase of roughly $165,000 (100,000 
pounds) from last year. This year's champion will get 320,000 
pounds, compared to 300,000 pounds that Mark O'Meara earned last 
year for winning. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase of 20,000 pounds to the winner is only the fourth  
largest raise this decade. The winner's share increased by 75,000 
pounds in 1996, and by 50,000 pounds in each of the past two 
years.

this year -- a mouthpiece to help her overcome Temporo-Mandibular 
Joint syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
	Webb's jaw never properly developed as a child, and it got so  
bad at times last year that her jaw would pop when she opened her 
mouth and sometimes wouldn't shut. Because of the pressure in her 
mouth generated by TMJ, it began to produce pain in her lower neck. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kept thinking that I'm only 23,'' Webb said. ``What's it  
going to be like when I'm 30?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Webb is supposed to keep the mouthpiece in at all times, even  
when she sleeps. The only time she cheats is during meals.

	``It makes it hard to get your teeth on the food, and it doesn't

	 *BALLESTEROS BUDDY:* Seve Ballesteros has selected Roberto De  
Vicenzo to introduce him when he is inducted into the World Golf 
Hall of Fame in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballesteros, who has won two Masters and three British Opens,  
first met De Vicenzo at Royal Birkdale in 1976 when they played a 
few practice rounds. As a 19-year-old in his first major 
championship, Ballesteros finished second to Johnny Miller in the 
British Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``He treated me with the same fondness and affection as a father  
would treat his own son,'' Ballesteros said. ``Furthermore, he gave 
me several pieces of advice which proved very useful later on 
during my career.'' 
</P>
<P>

would have needed 13 more victories to get in under the previous 
system.

	``Personally, I'd rather they kept it tough like it was  
before,'' Davies said. ``If you get 30 wins, that's pretty

<HEADLINE> TV Boasts Some Midseason Successes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- At first, Sandy Grushow could hardly  
believe his ears. 
</P>
<P>
	As most TV executives do in the morning, the president of  
Twentieth Century Fox Television had called a telephone hot line 
that gives the previous night's Nielsen Media Research ratings. 
When he heard the numbers for the premiere of NBC's new drama, 
``Providence,'' he thought it was a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite some bad reviews and a time slot that hadn't been very  
successful for NBC, ``Providence'' finished higher than any drama 
premiere since ``ER.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's no guarantee of success, but it had done better than most  
new shows do. Thirteen million TV sets were tuned to NBC by viewers 
who wanted to check out ``Providence.'' A few days later, Fox's 
animated comedy, ``The PJs,'' also scored unexpectedly high ratings 
in its debut. 
</P>
<P>
	What both shows had in common was the chance to bow far from the  
traditional September start of the TV season, when networks trot 
out dozens of new shows in the hope that a handful will catch on. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of the excitement that the fall premiere season means  
for viewers, many in the business fear it has become an anachronism 
or, worse, counterproductive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think most programming executives understand and appreciate  
the value of launching a show at a time when there is not nearly as 
much volume as there is in the fall,'' said Grushow, whose company 
produces programs like ``Ally McBeal'' and ``Dharma &AMP; Greg.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But the system is working against them,'' he said. ``The  
system is rigged against hit creation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	September debuts meant something when there were only three  
broadcast networks; a new show had the chance to stand out. Now, 
with six networks airing original prime-time lineups, and cable 
also competing for attention, many programs are lost in the crowd. 
Last season, a crushing 43 series debuted for the six networks in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
	It's no wonder many of them disappeared before most viewers knew  
they were on. It was much the same this past September. There were 
no new hits, and the season was judged to be a flop. But was that 
premature? ``Becker,'' which joined the CBS schedule in late 
October, has done well and this month's new shows at least 
alleviated the depression of network executives. 
</P>
<P>
	The non-September shows have an advantage, with networks able to  
bombard viewers with enough advertisements to let them know what's 
coming. Absent competition, the shows attract more curious channel 
surfers. 
</P>
<P>
	Newer networks seem particularly attuned to the value of  
avoiding September. The WB launched a promotional blitz to build a 
buzz for ``Dawson's Creek'' last January. ``King of the Hill'' was 
a midseason hit for Fox, and ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' launched 
midyear for the WB. Fox is introducing two prime-time cartoons in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past five years, there's been little change in the  
percentage of fall premieres that were still around a year later, 
said Stacey Lynn, vice president of broadcast research for TN 
Media, an ad-buying firm. But during the same period, the survival 
rate of midseason replacements has risen steadily. 
</P>
<P>
	So the solution is simple, right? How about one or two shows  
premiering each week, 52 weeks a year? 
</P>
<P>
	Don't bet on it. That would force the industry to change the way  
it's been doing business since the dawn of television. 
</P>
<P>
	TV's financial structure is built on a cycle that begins when  
network executives unveil their fall schedules to advertisers in 
New York each May. That launches a buying frenzy known as the 
``upfront,'' when companies lock in commercials for much of the 
next season. The practice lends at least a little fiscal stability 
to an unpredictable business, and it would be severely disrupted by 
an ever-evolving schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollywood's talent tends to be locked into contracts that end  
with the TV season in May or June, and there's a dearth of writers 
and actors for shows that don't follow the traditional development 
clock. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are all to some extent a prisoner of the system that has  
been in place for so long,'' said Lloyd Braun, chairman of Buena 
Vista Television, which makes the new ``Felicity'' and ``Sports 
Night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC Entertainment President Scott Sassa was the beneficiary of  
good timing for ``Providence.'' But asked about TV's rigid 
calendar, he expressed little desire to rock the boat and doubted 
things would fundamentally change. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of trying to change the system, networks this year are  
generally giving their new September series more time to settle in 
and find an audience. That has especially been the case at ABC, 
where the critically praised ``Sports Night'' and ``Cupid'' have 
been kept on the air despite ratings that are mediocre or worse. 
</P>
<P>
	The system appears to be one of those things that people in the  
business love to complain about but ultimately know won't change. 
Grushow will have to be satisfied with small victories: He 
persuaded ABC to launch his company's new show, ``Strange World,'' 
in midseason instead of September. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really afraid,'' Grushow said, ``that the system is so  
ingrained that it's the proverbial tail wagging the dog.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ...  
</P>
<P>
	SATURDAY'S SILVER ANNIVERSARY: Next fall marks the 25th  
anniversary of NBC's groundbreaking ``Saturday Night Live'' comedy 
series. The network plans to celebrate just like it did for the 
15th, with a three-hour, prime-time anniversary special Sept. 26. 
Ten years ago, an anniversary special was the second-rated show for 
the entire week, and NBC clearly hopes lightning strikes twice.

<HEADLINE> Freeze Tolerant Genes Discovered / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- For Michigan State University researcher  
Michael Thomashow, the secret to helping fruits and vegetables 
survive the cold may be in the genes. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant molecular biologist knew most plants have special  
freeze-tolerant genes that are activated by low temperatures. The 
genes encode proteins that help maintain the integrity of the 
plant's cell structure by stabilizing cell membranes. 
</P>
<P>
	However, it can be disastrous when the temperature dips quickly  
and plants can't adjust, as was the case in the freeze that turned 
California's citrus into mush last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Freezing temperatures cause the cell membranes to rupture,  
draining the juice inside the cell. When the temperature warms up 
again, that plant, tree or fruit becomes dehydrated and useless. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think more than likely, the problem with (California) citrus  
was that these genes were not being turned on very well,'' 
Thomashow said. ``They were not sensing low temperatures very well 
for whatever reason. Maybe they were bred that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several years ago, Thomashow first found the actual genes that  
program proteins to help the plant protect itself from the cold. 
Last year, he announced he had discovered a gene that works as a 
``master switch,'' turning on the worker genes that encode proteins 
to do their job during frigid temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have warm temperatures, you have none of these  
freeze-tolerant worker genes, but at cold temperatures, you have a 
lot of them,'' Thomashow said. ``We think we can increase plants to 
higher freeze tolerance levels by fooling the plant to think it's 
cold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One solution is to insert the master switch genes into plants  
and use a safe chemical to activate it. 
</P>
<P>
	That way, farmers can quickly raise the freeze tolerance level  
of their crops right after hearing the weather forecast. 
</P>
<P>
	But such practical application may be at least several years  
away. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomashow signed a contract in September with Mendel  
Biotechnology in Hayward, a Northern California company that will 
try to find practical applications for the scientist's findings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a slow process,'' Mendel President Mike Fromm said.  
``We're now getting into the nuts and bolts of putting the genes 
into different crops.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists must find ways to insert the master switch genes and  
then test the crop first in the lab, then later in greenhouses or 
temperature chambers. 
</P>
<P>
	Fromm estimates it will take three to five years before his  
scientists offer successful samples to farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a fantastic piece of science,'' Fromm said.  
``Mike (Thomashow) has found the most important gene in fighting 
the freeze.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the results of Thomashow's work may not be seen in the  
fields for a while, his discoveries will help other scientists in 
similar research around the world, said Charles Guy, plant 
physiologist at University of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been working for more than 20 years to identify worker  
genes in citrus trees that help them deal with cold weather. So 
far, he's found about five. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that Thomashow and several other labs around the  
world have really brought us to the door of genetically engineering 
cold tolerance in practical and realistic ways,'' Guy said.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Lays Out Ambitious Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, standing before a Congress  
torn over his fate, proposed Tuesday to protect Social Security 
with the huge budget surpluses that Republicans are eyeing for tax 
cuts. He also announced the government will sue the tobacco 
industry for smokers' health costs. 
</P>
<P>
	On a day of high drama that shifted from his daytime trial in  
the Senate to his prime-time State of the Union speech, Clinton 
made no mention of the sex-and-lies case that led to his 
impeachment and imperils his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the economy booming and the budget balanced, Clinton  
said America's achievements are sometimes overlooked ``in the clash 
of controversy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several Republicans boycotted the 77-minute speech; Chief  
Justice William Rehnquist, presiding over Clinton's trial, also 
stayed away. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, in their response to the president's speech, said  
the nation's business would not be hurt regardless of the outcome 
of Clinton's trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our country is not in crisis,'' said Rep. Jennifer Dunn,  
R-Wash. ``No matter what the outcome of the president's situation, 
life in America will go on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton opened his address by recalling the admonition of new  
House Speaker Dennis Hastert for Republicans and Democrats to work 
in a spirit of bipartisanship. ``Mr. Speaker, let's do exactly 
that,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the ornate House chamber where he was impeached one month ago  
on a party-line vote, the president was received with respect and 
interrupted by applause 95 times. Democrats were most enthusiastic. 
Two of his harshest Republican critics -- House Majority Leader Dick 
Armey of Texas and House Majority Whip Tom DeLay of Texas -- sat 
stonily side by side. 
</P>
<P>
	Demanding that Washington reserve $4 trillion in expected budget  
surpluses to shore up Social Security and Medicare, Clinton 
declared, ``First things first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a new salvo against smoking, Clinton announced the Justice  
Department will sue the tobacco industry. He also is seeking a 
55-cent-a-pack tax on cigarettes. ``Our children are targets of a 
massive media campaign to hook them on cigarettes,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also urged spending billions of dollars for new programs  
in child care, education, crime-fighting, the environment and the 
Pentagon. And he called for raising the minimum wage by $1 an hour 
over two years to $6.15. 
</P>
<P>
	``With our budget surplus growing, our economy expanding, our  
confidence rising, now is the time for this generation to meet our 
historic responsibility to the 21st century,'' Clinton said. 
``Let's get to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's speech came eight hours after White House lawyers  
began defending the president in a Senate trial, arguing he was 
innocent of perjury and obstruction of justice charges and ``must 
not be removed from office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two special guests sat in the House chamber with first lady  
Hillary Rodham Clinton as the president spoke: civil rights pioneer 
Rosa Parks and baseball slugger Sammy Sosa. Clinton singled out his 
wife, saying ``I honor her'' for her work with children and on 
behalf of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	On education, the president said he would send Congress a plan  
that for the first time holds states and school districts 
accountable for their progress and rewards them for results, he 
said. Schools that fail to comply could lose some of the $15 
billion the federal government spends on education. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe we must change the way we invest that money, to  
support what works and to stop supporting what doesn't,'' the 
president said. No child should graduate from high school ``with a 
diploma he or she can't read,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	In his remarks on foreign policy, Clinton said the United States  
will continue to contain Iraq's Saddam Hussein. ``And we will work 
for the day when Iraq has a government worthy of its people,'' 
Clinton said. In the aftermath of the killing of more than 40 
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, Clinton said the United States and NATO 
allies ``are pressing the Serbian government to stop its brutal 
repression in Kosovo, to bring those responsible to justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also proposed $4.2 billion -- a 70 percent increase -- to  
dismantle and destroy Russia's nuclear arsenal and redirect the 
work of Russian scientists from weapons to civilian research. 
</P>
<P>
	On Social Security, Clinton's proposal sets up a monumental  
fight over how to protect the giant retirement program and deal 
with GOP tax-cutting ambitions against a background of $4 trillion 
in projected surpluses over 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's proposal would create new 401(k)-style  
retirement accounts for workers and invest some of Social 
Security's cash reserves in the stock market for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	In sharp contrast, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott called for  
a 10 percent across-the-board tax cut. Republicans also attacked 
the idea of having the government invest Social Security cash on 
Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, no, a thousand times no,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas,  
House Ways and Means chairman. ``If you thought a government 
takeover of health care was bad, just wait until the government 
becomes an owner of America's private sector companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton proposed transferring about 60 percent of expected  
budget surpluses over the next 15 years -- $2.7 trillion -- to the 
Social Security account to keep the program solvent until 2055. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-five percent of that money would be invested by the  
government in the stock market in hopes of achieving higher 
returns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I reach out my hand to those of you of both parties in both  
houses and ask you to join me in saying we will save Social 
Security now,'' Clinton said. ``Last year, we wisely reserved all 
of the surplus until we knew what it would take to save Social 
Security. Again, I say, we should not spend any of it until after 
Social Security is truly saved. 
</P>
<P>
	``First things first.''  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's plan also would reserve 15 percent of the surplus --  
$650 billion over 15 years -- for the ailing Medicare system. An 
additional 11 percent of the surplus -- $500 billion -- would be 
devoted to new government-subsidized retirement accounts, with the 
Treasury matching the savings of lower-income people. The rest of 
the surplus would go for military spending and domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Never before has a president delivered a State of the Union  
address under such extraordinary conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's House accusers and Senate judges were the immediate  
audience, although his real target was millions of Americans 
watching at home. His job was to convince them he is faithful to 
their interests and should remain in power.

Social Security is truly saved. 
</P>
<P>
	``First things first.''  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's plan also would reserve 15 percent of the surplus --  
$650 billion over 15 years -- for the ailing Medicare system. An 
additional 11 percent of the surplus -- $500 billion -- would be 
devoted to new government-subsidized retirement accounts, with the 
Treasury matching the savings of lower-income people. The rest of 
the surplus would go for military spending and domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Never before has a president delivered a State of the Union  
address under such extraordinary conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's House accusers and Senate judges were the immediate  
audience, although his real target was millions of Americans 
watching at home. His job was to convince them he is faithful to 
their interests and should remain in power.

<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. plans to acquire an engineering  
company with expertise in stamping aluminum automotive parts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford announced Tuesday that it has signed a letter of intent to  
acquire Troy Design and Manufacturing of Redford, with which it has 
worked for more than 20 years to design dies to stamp aluminum. 
Ford said the acquisition fits with its goal to increase the use of 
lightweight parts. 
</P>
<P>
	``High-volume application of lightweight materials, including  
aluminum, is a key to increasing fuel economy and decreasing 
emissions to address global environmental concerns,'' said Neil 
Ressler, Ford's chief technical officer.

<HEADLINE> Fed To Stand Pat on Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Last year, with the global economy threatening  
to spin out of control following the collapse of the Russian ruble, 
the Federal Reserve came to the rescue with a string of interest 
rate cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	But economists are not looking for that pattern to be repeated  
now that the global crisis has jumped to Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the widespread belief is that the central bank will  
remain on the sidelines for now, expressing watchful concern about 
developments in Latin America but constrained from lowering rates 
further by a U.S. economy that, despite the global crisis, has 
shown little sign of slowing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Fed eased pre-emptively in late 1998. What did it get for  
this?'' said Paul Kasriel, chief economist at Northern Trust Co. in 
Chicago. ``An economy stronger than it bargained for and a stock 
market higher than the Fed feels is justified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed's views on the 18-month-old global financial crisis,  
which last week struck in Brazil, were to be revealed today with an 
appearance by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan before the 
House Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The appearance marked Greenspan's first congressional testimony  
on the economy since September. At that time, financial markets in 
the United States and around the world were plunging as investors 
feared that the global crisis that began in Asia in mid-1997 had 
entered a new and far more virulent phase with the decision by 
Russia to default on billions of dollars in foreign debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan declared then that the Fed was ready to prevent the  
market turmoil from ``really spilling over and creating some very 
significant difficulties for all of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He followed up that pledge with three rapid-fire reductions in  
the central bank's federal funds rate, the interest that banks 
charge each other on overnight loans. The last reduction on Nov. 17 
pushed the funds rate down to 4.75 percent, its lowest level in 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Those Fed rate cuts were enough to do the trick, calming  
investor fears and pushing U.S. stock prices back into record 
territory. The renewed investor confidence helped the U.S. economy 
weather the pummeling applied to American factories and farms by 
the big loss in export sales to Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Bolstered by a confident consumer sector, the overall economy  
was probably growing at a brisk 4 percent annual rate in the 
just-completed October-December quarter, many analysts believe, a 
growth rate that pushed unemployment back down to a three-decade 
low of 4.3 percent. In December, the current expansion notched 
another record, becoming at 93 months the longest peacetime period 
of uninterrupted growth in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
	Most economists are looking for growth to slow markedly in 1999  
as the drag from foreign turmoil finally begins to bite. But the 
slowdown has yet to occur and for that reason, economists don't 
believe Greenspan is likely to signal any change in Fed policy. 
</P>
<P>
	While the rapid U.S. growth rate and low unemployment would  
normally have the central bank pondering rate increases because of 
inflation fears, prices have continued to be well-behaved. Consumer 
inflation was up just 1.6 percent last year, capping the best 
back-to-back inflation performance in 33 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The combination of a strong U.S. economy and unsettled  
conditions overseas will keep the central bank on hold at least 
through the first half of this year, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is that the Fed will stand pat and not do  
anything,'' said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo in 
Minneapolis.

<HEADLINE>  British Aerospace Buying Marconi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- British Aerospace PLC is buying Marconi  
Electronics for $12.7 billion, creating the world's third-largest 
defense company and a rival to industry leaders Boeing Co. and 
Lockheed Martin Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, which must be approved by British antitrust  
authorities, was poorly received by other members of the European 
defense industry, which has been reorganizing itself in hopes of 
launching its own defense giant to take on Lockheed and Boeing. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's DaimlerChrysler Aerospace, or DASA -- which until  
recently had been expected to merge with British Aerospace -- said 
the deal could make other defense mergers difficult and ``create an 
obstacle to European integration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Marconi suitor Thomson-CSF of France agreed that ``it is  
hard to see how that (merger) fits into a wider European picture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense contractors as well as governments on the European  
continent had favored a cross-border merger in order to create a 
more international company, rather than a combination of two 
British firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders also expressed disapproval with the deal, selling  
off shares of British Aerospace as well as those of from General 
Electric Co. PLC, Marconi's parent company. GEC, as it is commonly 
known, is unrelated to U.S. industrial giant General Electric Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors, believing that British Aerospace was paying too much  
for Marconi, pushed shares in British Aerospace down 14 percent on 
the London Stock Exchange. GEC shares fell 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	British Aerospace, which manufactures civil and military  
aircraft, guided weapons, ordnance and electronics equipment, 
insisted that the deal will help, rather than hinder, the creation 
of a pan-European defense group. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reorganization of our industry in Europe is a highly  
complex process and it is helped enormously if just one major 
player speaks for each country,'' chairman Sir Richard Evans told a 
news conference in London. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reality is that Europe can actually afford only one major  
aerospace entity. We absolutely have to move European consolidation 
forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Industry insiders fear that, unless Europe's defense  
manufacturers pool their skills, finances and research, they will 
be picked off one by one by U.S. firms keen to expand into European 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	DASA said it will now consider mergers with other European  
companies. Other potential members of a European defense group 
include France's Aerospatiale, Spain's Construcciones Aeronauticas 
and Finmeccanica of Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Lord Simpson, chief executive of GEC, said the growing demand  
for Marconi's advanced avionics, radar and defense systems had made 
it the ``pretty girl of the defense consolidation dance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson said the deal ``is very much a win-win situation'' that  
will give shareholders a stake in the enlarged British Aerospace 
and a more focused GEC, which is Britain's second-largest defense 
contractor with annual sales of about $6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the deal, British Aerospace will assume $2.5 billion  
of GEC debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies said the merger will lead to annual cost savings  
of about $453.7 million within three years, probably around the end 
of 2002. The one-time cost of achieving the cost savings is put at 
about $330 million over that three-year period. 
</P>
<P>
	GEC retains its civil electronics and telecommunications  
businesses and the Marconi name. 
</P>
<P>
	British Aerospace and Marconi, which together employ some  
130,000 people worldwide -- more than 18,000 of them in the United 
States -- said most jobs would be safeguarded. But restructuring 
could result in a small number of jobs being lost.

<HEADLINE> Report: China Tobacco Profits Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- Profits for China's state tobacco  
monopoly rose 18 percent last year to $11 billion, boosted by a 
crackdown on smuggled and counterfeit cigarettes, state media 
reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The profit increase came despite a 3.1 percent decline in  
cigarette sales to 1.6 trillion, the China Daily newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	China is the world's biggest tobacco market, with an estimated  
320 million smokers. Cigarette sales account for about 10 percent 
of government revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	The lure of such a huge market, coupled with small import quotas  
and high taxes, has led to widespread smuggling of foreign brands 
and underground production. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese authorities seized 1.4 billion smuggled cigarettes last  
year and 9.4 billion illegally made cigarettes, the report said. It 
said they shut down nearly 1,300 illegal production facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Some legitimate producers were ordered to suspend output because  
of large inventories, the China Daily said. At the end of the year, 
Chinese tobacco companies had a total backlog of 148.9 billion 
unsold cigarettes.

<HEADLINE> Gov. Bush Touts Character in Speach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush was sworn in for a  
second term on Tuesday, saying Texas must teach children that moral 
character counts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must be willing to draw a clear line between right and  
wrong,'' the Republican governor said in a speech delivered at the 
same time President Clinton's defense lawyers were making arguments 
in his impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, an undeclared front-runner among prospective 2000 GOP  
presidential candidates, made no mention of Clinton. But he said it 
is important to teach Texas children values along with academic 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people think it's inappropriate to make moral judgments  
anymore. Not me,'' Bush said, drawing a cheer from onlookers. 
</P>
<P>
	``For our children to have the kind of life we want for them,  
they must learn to say yes to responsibility, yes to family, yes to 
honesty and work, and no to drugs, no to violence, no to 
promiscuity or having babies out of wedlock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who won re-election in November with 69 percent of the  
vote, leads a state government that's dominated almost entirely by 
Republicans for the first time since Reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
	All 29 statewide officeholders are Republicans, and the GOP  
controls the Texas Senate. While the 150-member House remains 
Democratic, that majority of 78 seats is the smallest in a century. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush used the speech to revisit his campaign theme of  
compassionate conservatism. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must rally the armies of compassion that are in every  
community of this state,'' he said. ``We must encourage them to 
love, to nurture, to mentor, to help and thus to offer hope to 
those who have none.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seen Urging New Trade Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton plans to call for a new  
round of global trade negotiations in his State of the Union speech 
tonight, hoping to counter protectionist forces set loose by the 
current worldwide financial turmoil, a senior administration 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
	The official, speaking on grounds of anonymity, said Clinton  
would seek to ensure that a broad range of trade areas would be 
covered by the talks, which would be launched in December at a U.S. 
meeting of the more than 120 nations that are members of the World 
Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will frame the request for new trade talks as an answer  
to the current global economic turmoil. Forty percent of the world 
has been plunged into recession and he still-prosperous U.S. 
economy has suffered record-high trade deficits as American 
exporters lose overseas markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president believes these negotiations are more important  
than ever because of the financial turmoil,'' said the 
administration official. ``This period of financial stress puts a 
lot of pressure on our trading partners to backtrack on reform and 
openness and the president sees a new round as keeping the momentum 
going for openness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new round of talks would require Congress to grant the  
president new trade negotiating authority to conduct the 
discussions under a ``fast track'' that would prohibit Congress 
from amending the agreement once it is reached. However, Clinton 
has been blocked for several years in his efforts to win a renewal 
of fast-track authority because of disputes over how labor and 
environmental issues should be treated in trade negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration wants to include protection of worker rights  
and the environment in trade discussions, which traditionally focus 
on how to lower trade barriers so goods can flow more freely 
between nations. But Republicans, backed by American businesses, 
have balked at this suggestion, warning that it risks diluting the 
main purpose of the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	European and Japanese officials had been urging the United  
States to back a new, comprehensive round of negotiations but the 
administration had been debating internally just how broad those 
talks should be, fearing a repeat of the experience under the last 
global trade talks. That Uruguay Round, launched in 1986 in Punta 
del Este, Uruguay, dragged on for seven years because countries 
could not reach agreement on all facets of the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	It is possible the new round could be called the Clinton Round  
since the president is proposing the talks and they will be 
launched at a ministerial meeting in the United States in December, 
according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported 
Clinton's decision in today's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	One other round of global talks was named for a U.S. president,  
the Kennedy round conducted from 1964 to 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	The location for the U.S. conference has not been set although  
several cities, including Dallas, Detroit and Honolulu, are under 
consideration as a site.

<HEADLINE>  First Lady Cheers Clinton at Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton praised his wife Tuesday  
night for ``her historic role'' in serving the country. For her 
part, the first lady rose to her feet repeatedly to applaud her 
husband's State of the Union address. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton took her customary front-row seat in the visitors'  
gallery overlooking the floor of the House several minutes before 
the president was led into the chamber. Chicago Cubs slugger Sammy 
Sosa, Denver Mayor Wellington E. Webb, civil rights stalwart Rosa 
Parks and Tipper Gore were among those seated with her. 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing a black pantsuit brightened by a gold-toned American  
eagle pinned to her left shoulder, Mrs. Clinton smiled, applauded 
and stood when members of Congress, led by Democrats, stood 
repeatedly to applaud the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton singled his wife out for special recognition after he  
noted that ``the bridge into the new millennium'' was less than 400 
days away. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton has spearheaded a project celebrating the nation's  
past and its future with the approach of the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to take just a minute to honor her, for leading our  
millennium project, for all she's done for our children, for all 
she has done in her historic role to serve our nation and our best 
ideals at home and abroad, I honor her,'' Clinton said, slowly 
emphasizing his last three words. Mrs. Clinton smiled, rose from 
her seat in the gallery and mouthed ``Thank you'' to the applauding 
crowd below. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second straight year that Clinton delivered his  
showcase speech against the backdrop of the Monica Lewinsky 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, news of his relationship with the former White House  
intern became public just a few days before his 1998 address, and 
Mrs. Clinton quickly stepped into the role of chief presidential 
defender. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, her public comments have been limited to expression  
of love, support and admiration for her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's tribute to his wife Tuesday night was the second in  
less than a week. 
</P>
<P>
	He moved her to tears last Friday at the annual Democratic  
National Committee fund-raising gala with an unscripted tribute for 
her accomplishments and unwavering support through difficult times. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love her for it, but our country should love her for it as  
well,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, a Chicago native, met Sosa last October in the  
Dominican Republic, Sosa's homeland, where they were both involved 
in bringing relief to hurricane victims. She also invited him to 
preside over the lighting of the national Christmas tree last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, in his speech, noted that sports records are broken  
sooner or later but making other people's lives better was 
``something that lasts forever. So for far more than baseball, 
Sammy Sosa, you are a hero of two countries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa and Mark McGuire of the St. Louis Cardinals last season  
both smashed the home record of 61 set by the Yankees' Roger Maris 
in 1961. McGuire finished with 70 home runs and Sosa 66 for the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side of Mrs. Clinton was Loc Truong, a 23-year-old  
Vietnam refugee and AmeriCorps member who mentors students at San 
Luis Obispo High School in California.

	Industry insiders fear that, unless Europe's defense  
manufacturers pool their skills, finances and research, they will 
be picked off one by one by U.S. firms keen to expand into European 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	DASA said it will now consider mergers with other European  
companies. Other potential members of a European defense group 
include France's Aerospatiale, Spain's Construcciones Aeronauticas 
and Finmeccanica of Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Lord Simpson, chief executive of GEC, said the growing demand  
for Marconi's advanced avionics, radar and defense systems had made 
it the ``pretty girl of the defense consolidation dance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson said the deal ``is very much a win-win situation'' that  
will give shareholders a stake in the enlarged British Aerospace 
and a more focused GEC, which is Britain's second-largest defense 
contractor with annual sales of about $6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the deal, British Aerospace will assume $2.5 billion  
of GEC debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies said the merger will lead to annual cost savings  
of about $453.7 million within three years, probably around the end 
of 2002. The one-time cost of achieving the cost savings is put at 
about $330 million over that three-year period. 
</P>
<P>
	GEC retains its civil electronics and telecommunications  
businesses and the Marconi name. 
</P>
<P>
	British Aerospace and Marconi, which together employ some  
130,000 people worldwide -- more than 18,000 of them in the United 
States -- said most jobs would be safeguarded. But restructuring 
could result in a small number of jobs being lost.

<HEADLINE> Toronto Fingered in IOC Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Amid all the reports of lavish treatment for IOC  
members, this favor seems anything but jet-set -- a government 
forestry job and a modest home in the remote Ontario steel city of 
Sault Ste. Marie. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet revelations that such a job was provided in 1989 to Finnish  
forester Bjarne Haeggman helped convince his ex-wife, Pirjo 
Haeggman, to resign from the IOC on Tuesday -- the first IOC member 
to quit as a result of the steadily widening bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The job with Ontario's Natural Resources Ministry was arranged  
with the help of the Toronto committee that bid to host the 1996 
Summer Games. The committee also paid the Haeggmans' $650-a-month 
rent in Sault Ste. Marie. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators also have alleged that Bjarne Haeggman did  
consulting work in Salt Lake City at the time that city was 
successfully bidding for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Henderson, who was head of the Toronto bid committee,  
insisted in an e-mail sent Monday to Toronto media that the rent 
money was supposed to be repaid by the Haeggmans and was not an 
attempt to win Pirjo Haeggman's vote for Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	But Henderson said he was unsure whether his committee was in  
fact reimbursed and instructed Ron Bertram, the committee's chief 
operating officer, to try to find the records. 
</P>
<P>
	Trevor Isherwood, who at the time was an Ontario forest  
management official, said Henderson flew to Sault Ste. Marie to 
personally push for Bjarne Haeggman to be hired, and later 
pressured the ministry to keep the Finn on the job even though his 
work was lackluster. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he was very interested in working,'' Isherwood  
told the Toronto Sun. 
</P>
<P>
	Isherwood said Haeggman had a masters degree in forestry and was  
qualified for the job, which involved making an inventory of trees 
in Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
	The Finn was given a 20-month contract, was paid about $36,000,  
and quit four days before the IOC vote in September 1990 that 
awarded the 1996 Games to Atlanta. Toronto finished third in the 
voting behind Athens. 
</P>
<P>
	The Haeggmans lived for more than a year in a white wood-paneled  
bungalow in Sault Ste. Marie, a steel and paper-mill city of 80,000 
across the St. Mary's River from Michigan's Upper Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson -- who is in Australia for the world sailing  
championships -- said in his e-mail that his committee made no 
secret of the arrangement with the Haeggmans. He contended that 
even IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch knew about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone knew she was here and both Atlanta and Salt Lake  
(Olympic bid committees) visited her there (Sault Ste. Marie) and 
her address in the IOC Directory stated that,'' Henderson said. 
``And she and I had cleared it through Samaranch and the Finn 
Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was all open and above board.''  
</P>
<P>
	But Henderson confirmed the Toronto committee ended up paying  
the Haeggmans' rent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Sault landlord demanded a better covenant than a (promise  
from) a `Finnish immigrant' and would accept payment only from a 
Canadian account, so TOOC (the Toronto committee) paid,'' Henderson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And to my knowledge, Bjarne was billed by TOOC or was supposed  
to reimburse (TOOC) from his salary since living on the street with 
two young kids in the winter in Sault Ste. Marie was not an 
option.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement from Helsinki, Pirjo Haeggman said she thought  
the rent was paid ``according to the contract by my husband's 
employer. It is a surprise for me that the committee paid the 
rent.''

<HEADLINE> CORE: Sosa Made Outrageous Demands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sammy Sosa failed to appear for a Congress of  
Racial Equality fund-raiser at which he was scheduled to be honored 
and CORE officials said he made outrageous demands. 
</P>
<P>
	CORE attorney Mel Sachs said Sosa's people made excessive  
demands that could not be met before the Monday dinner, a charge 
the agent for the Chicago Cubs outfielder denied. 
</P>
<P>
	CORE national chairman Roy Innis said the organization agreed to  
provide Sosa with four first-class round-trip airline tickets 
between New York and his Dominican Republic home, a limousine and a 
double hotel suite in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	But CORE officials balked at Sosa's alleged demands for a  
private jet to fly him to and from the Mike Tyson fight at Las 
Vegas Saturday night and a $50,000 charitable donation to help 
Dominican hurricane victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't afford a private jet, and even if I could, I  
wouldn't do it,'' Innis said at the dinner, which was attended by 
2,500 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa, who hit 66 home runs last year, second only to Mark  
McGwire's record 70, has ``to learn how to deal with his 15 minutes 
of fame,'' Innis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Innis' remarks caused a group of about 20 Dominican leaders to  
leave the Martin Luther King Jr. Day dinner in protest. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa was supposed to receive CORE's International Brotherhood  
Award for achievement. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa's agent, Adam Katz, said CORE's statements about the  
negotiations were distorted. 
</P>
<P>
	``We by no means ever asked CORE to pay for private airplanes,''  
he said. ``To be engaged in a disagreement or misunderstanding with 
the people at CORE is extremely disappointing to Sammy and me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Katz said that while Sosa has traveled by private plane during  
this offseason, he doesn't expect charitable organizations to pay. 
Sosa has tried to arrange several functions in short time periods 
during his U.S. trips. Katz said Sosa never committed to the CORE 
event and the schedule became too congested for him to attend.

<HEADLINE>  Knicks To Acquire Latrell Sprewell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Knicks apparently emerged as the  
winning bidder in the Latrell Sprewell auction, and the three-time 
All-Star is expected to be dealt to New York as soon as the lockout 
ends, sources told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Two league sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the  
Knicks beat out the Miami Heat and Indiana Pacers in the bidding 
for Sprewell, whose attack on Golden State Warriors coach P.J. 
Carlesimo last season led to one of the harshest penalties in NBA 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	However, The New York Times and San Jose Mercury News reported  
today that Seattle and Portland might still be in the running after 
making last-minute bids for the guard. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear who the Knicks would send to the  
Warriors. New York was believed to be offering forward Chris Mills 
and guard Chris Childs, with Golden State general manager Garry St. 
Jean asking for John Starks. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Jean told all interested teams to make their best offers by  
4 p.m. EST Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal would work under salary cap guidelines if any two of  
the three Knicks were packaged together. Sprewell was due to make 
$8.3 million this season, while Childs makes $3.64 million, Mills 
makes $3.6 million and Starks makes $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Knicks, Sprewell would play alongside the Knicks' other  
shooting guard, Allan Houston, in a three-guard formation much like 
New York used for most of last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks, Heat and Pacers had been known to be the leading  
bidders in the Sprewell sweepstakes, and the AP learned that a 
complicated four-team trade involving Golden State, Miami, 
Cleveland and Boston also was discussed. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell would have gone to the Heat along with Bimbo Coles and  
Clarence Weatherspoon, with Golden State getting Brent Barry, Dan 
Majerle and Bobby Sura. Boston would have received Jamal Mashburn 
and Vitaly Potapenko, and Cleveland would have received Paul Pierce 
and Andrew Declercq. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the league's most notorious choke artist -- as Sprewell  
has come to be known for obvious reasons -- will be playing in the 
harsh spotlight of the nation's media capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell has averaged 20.1 points over his six-year career,  
including a career-high 24.2 points in 1996-97. 
</P>
<P>
	He was suspended for one year and had his contract terminated by  
the Warriors for his attack on coach Carlesimo in December 1997, 
although an arbitrator reduced the suspension to 68 games and 
reinstated the final two years of his contract after a hearing last 
February. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell will make $9 million next season, but more importantly  
will elevate the Knicks to the status of top Eastern Conference 
contender for the upcoming season. 
</P>
<P>
	No deals can be finalized until the lockout settlement is put  
into writing, which won't happen until Tuesday night at the 
earliest. If the deal is finalized Tuesday night, trades and free 
agent signings will begin Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Warms to Surprising Falcons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- No one expected the Atlanta Falcons to be in the  
Super Bowl. Even the NFL was caught off guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Dan Reeves was grinning with satisfaction Monday as he  
discussed his dealings with the league after the Falcons shocked 
the heavily favored Minnesota Vikings in the NFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, following Atlanta's 30-27 overtime victory, Reeves  
met with two NFL officials about the schedule of events at the Jan. 
31 Super Bowl in Miami. He couldn't help but notice the itinerary 
was sprinkled with references to the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, on Monday, the NFL faxed Reeves a memo that included  
another faux pas. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could tell they weren't expecting us because it said,  
`Atlanta Falcons, head coach Denny Green,''' Reeves said, grinning 
with satisfaction. ``They had changed the team from Minnesota 
Vikings, but they forgot to change the head coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Well, get used to the idea of Atlanta playing in the Super Bowl,  
as strange as that may seem for a franchise that's had only eight 
winning seasons in 33 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Denver is an early seven-point favorite in  
the Super Bowl, which doesn't bother the Falcons a bit. They have 
reveled in the role of underdog all season, beating a Minnesota 
team that was a double-figure favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole country had them beating us by 11 points, had them  
on top of the world,'' tight end O.J. Santiago said. ``Every time I 
looked at the TV, it seemed like Minnesota was on there. There's 
nothing wrong with that. They broke a lot of records. 
</P>
<P>
	``But at 14-2 (Atlanta's record during the regular season), you  
think somebody would notice we've got a good team. Now, maybe they 
will notice us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oh, they're noticing -- especially in Atlanta, where the city  
awoke Monday with a giant ``Dirty Bird'' hangover. 
</P>
<P>
	The party spilled into the streets as soon as Morten Andersen's  
kick sailed through the uprights, then moved to Hartsfield Atlanta 
International Airport, where the team was greeted by more than 
5,000 people late Sunday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	``You felt like you were in a dream world,'' said linebacker  
Jessie Tuggle, who has been with the Falcons for a dozen, mostly 
losing seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 4,000 or so revelers jammed the team's suburban training  
complex, creating a rush hour-like traffic jam in the middle of the 
night. The scene was surreal when the players, after taking buses 
from the airport, appeared on a second-floor balcony, saluting the 
crowd that had taken over the practice field below. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was absolutely nuts,'' Tuggle said. ``It was like a rock  
concert in Suwanee, Ga.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves, who underwent heart bypass surgery just five weeks ago,  
endured a whirlwind schedule Monday. After getting only 4 1/2 hours of 
sleep, he appeared on ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' stopped by 
Piedmont Hospital for a routine checkup, and held his usual 
postgame news conference in Suwanee. The team will begin practicing 
for the Broncos on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the Super Bowl focus will be on Reeves, who will be  
facing the team he coached for 12 years and took to three title 
games. He'll also be facing the coach he fired for alleged 
subordination and the quarterback who said playing for Reeves was 
``hell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves, fired by the Broncos after the 1992 season, insisted  
Monday that he has buried any hard feelings for Mike Shanahan and 
John Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't live in the past,'' the Falcons coach said. ``If  
you're going to be a football coach and you preach and teach to the 
players that they should look to the next play and not think about 
the last one, I think you have to go through life the same way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves said there was a reconciliation of sorts last summer,  
when by chance all three wound up playing golf on the same day at 
Augusta National. The Atlanta coach congratulated Shanahan and 
Elway on their Super Bowl victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's done in the past is done,'' Reeves said. ``I can look  
myself in the mirror and say I did what was best for my football 
team at the time. You have to make some tough decisions. I can't 
change them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, there are new debts to pay.  
</P>
<P>
	Reeves, who turns 55 today, promised to perform the ``Dirty  
Bird'' dance in downtown Atlanta if the Falcons made the Super 
Bowl. He claims he did just that in the pre-dawn hours Monday, 
stopping his car along Peachtree Street and flapping his arms. 
</P>
<P>
	There's only one problem: he had no witnesses.  
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't say how long and I didn't say when, so I did it this  
morning,'' Reeves said with a smile. ``It was 6:45, and there was 
nobody on the road. That's why I did it, and I did it goooood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Falcons receiver Terance Mathis, who caught the touchdown pass  
that sent the game to overtime, wasn't buying Reeves' version of 
events. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a copout, man,'' Mathis said with a laugh. ``He could  
have at least called the media and alerted them. That doesn't 
count. We're going to make him do it.''

<HEADLINE> Willey Case Witness Pleads Innocent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- Vowing to fight the charges with ``every  
last breath in my body,'' a woman who undercut Kathleen Willey's 
claim of an unwanted sexual advance by President Clinton said 
Tuesday the case should be thrown out because prosecutor Kenneth 
Starr has a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Julie Hiatt Steele pleaded innocent to three counts of  
obstruction of justice and one of making a false statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Her attorney, Nancy Luque, said Starr had obtained a grand jury  
indictment in Virginia in order to avoid the federal courts in 
Washington where he suffered a setback in prosecuting Clinton 
friend, Webster Hubbell. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, Starr is appealing the decision of a federal  
judge who threw out a tax evasion case against Hubbell. Luque said 
she will move to dismiss the Virginia indictment against Ms. Steele 
on the grounds that it should have been brought in the District of 
Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the federal courthouse in Alexandria, Ms. Steele said  
she ``could not imagine being caught in a political storm ... (for) 
crimes I did not commit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I intend to fight the charges with every last breath in my  
body,'' Ms. Steele said, acknowledging she has received offers of 
significant financial help. She did not give any details. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment against Ms. Steele details events which raise the  
possibility someone persuaded her to give a phony story last 
February that was helpful to Clinton in the Paula Jones sexual 
harassment lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele in an affidavit denied that Mrs. Willey told her  
about the president's sexual advance and asserted that Mrs. Willey 
asked Ms. Steele to lie to a Newsweek magazine reporter regarding 
the alleged advance. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment says Ms. Steele initially declined to sign the  
affidavit last Jan. 28 on the advice of her attorney, but that 
``sometime thereafter ... changed her mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment does not state why she supposedly changed her  
mind, but states that Ms. Steele was interviewed by ``an attorney 
for President Clinton'' three weeks before signing the affidavit on 
Feb. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Luque said Starr has a conflict of interest because of his prior  
contact with lawyers in the Paula Jones case before he was 
appointed to investigate the Clintons. Starr spoke on several 
occasions with Mrs. Jones's lawyers about whether a civil case 
could move forward against a sitting president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I plead absolutely not guilty,'' Ms. Steele told U.S. District  
Judge Claude Hilton, who set a trial date of March 30. Luque told 
the judge three times she was willing to waive the speedy trial 
law, a move that would have given her more time to prepare for her 
defense. But Hilton said there was no reason not to proceed 
promptly. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr has had ``over a year'' and spent ``a million dollars'' in  
bringing the case, Luque said.

<HEADLINE> Price's Family Struggles With Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NACOGDOCHES, Texas (AP) -- Relatives of a former Stephen F.  
Austin basketball star who had a brief stint as a professional 
player were struggling Tuesday to understand why Katrina Price 
would kill herself. 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old basketball star apparently took her life with a  
shotgun early Monday in the apartment she shared with her younger 
sister, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Glenda Shead, one of her eight sisters, said Price called her  
family shortly before the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	``She talked to one sister about 6 yesterday morning,'' Shead,  
40, said. ``She just said she was deeply depressed, and we offered 
to come and visit with her and help her. But an hour after she hung 
up, it happened. We had no idea she was this depressed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Price never told her family what was depressing her, Shead said.  
</P>
<P>
	A neighbor called 911 after hearing screams. A minute later, a  
shot rang out. Police found Price dead, slumped over a shotgun. 
There were no signs of a struggle and it appeared she shot herself, 
Sgt. Paul Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Price's sister, Lucy Price, told police she awoke to find her  
sister holding a shotgun. Peterson said it appears Lucy Price, who 
attends Stephen F. Austin, tried to talk her sister out of killing 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
	Police got a 911 call from Lucy Price at 6:58 a.m. saying that  
her sister had shot herself. 
</P>
<P>
	Katrina Price played briefly in the now defunct American  
Basketball League after going undrafted in the WNBA. She was a 
member of the Long Beach StingRays and later the Philadephia Rage, 
but the league collapsed after filing for bankruptcy in December. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her career in the ABL was cut short, but she seemed to be OK  
with it,'' Shead said from her home in Kilgore, where the family 
gathered to prepare for Price's funeral. ``She was just looking 
forward to working this spring at one of the schools in Nacogdoches 
and going overseas in September'' to play in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Police told the family that Price left a note, but Shead said  
she has not seen it. 
</P>
<P>
	Price was a third-team All-America player last season when she  
averaged 22.1 points and 5.3 rebounds per game. The 5-foot-10 guard 
was the Ladyjacks' career scoring leader with 2,278 points.

<HEADLINE> Critics Pressing Olympics Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Utah critics of Salt Lake staging the 2002  
Winter Games are demanding a statewide vote on whether taxpayers 
are willing to accept potential financial liability. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar initiative effort four years ago was unsuccessful, but  
that was before the scandal over Salt Lake Olympics officials' 
distributing hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, scholarships 
and gifts to IOC members and their relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	In another development Monday, IOC officials said their  
investigation into the allegations of corruption will extend beyond 
Salt Lake's efforts to secure the Winter Olympics to bids made by 
other cities in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	In Lausanne, Switzerland, IOC Director General Francois Carrard  
said a six-member IOC investigating commission is determined ``to 
look at every piece of evidence'' concerning graft, bribery and 
vote-buying allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	He was quoted by The Washington Post as saying the inquiry no  
longer is confined to Salt Lake City's bid but that investigators 
are gathering facts worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	People involved in other cities' Olympic bids recently have come  
forward with assertions that some IOC members suggested that how 
they would vote might hinge on how well they were treated. 
</P>
<P>
	``For many years, there were rumors. We have never been able to  
have the beginning of evidence,'' Carrard said. ``We had 
allegations; we had hearsay. When we tried to get evidence, we 
always faced a wall of silence, even by people who said publicly 
they would disclose certain things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, due to the Salt Lake City scandal, Carrard said, the IOC is  
for the first time uncovering hard facts, including ``names, 
amounts, account numbers and access to files and documents from 
where we could go on with the investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC's panel, led by vice president Dick Pound of Canada, has  
asked 13 IOC members to explain actions by themselves or members of 
their families. IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch says nine 
cases are serious enough to possibly lead to expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC executive board will recommend action Jan. 24, with the  
full 115-member IOC called into special session March 17-18 to 
decide their fate and consider changes in the bidding process. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound, interviewed on ABC's Nightline news program Monday night,  
said that before the March meeting, ``we will write to the leaders 
of all the bid committees in recent games ... and ask them to come 
forward now that they can see we're serious'' about getting rid of 
the bad apples. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe they'll come forward. Maybe we'll find some additional  
names. Maybe we'll find the same people,'' he said. ``It's not 
something we're shirking. It's going to be painful and it's 
embarrassing but we're going to come out of it, I think, a stronger 
and better Olympics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Utahns for Responsible Public Spending is not sure even a  
stronger, better Olympics should be in Utah, particularly if its 
taxpayers may have to foot part of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've gotta figure out who's going to pay and quit pointing  
fingers at each other,'' said Stephen Pace, head of the group 
critical of Utah holding the games. ``The governor says the state 
has a moral obligation. Do voters believe they do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The group filed a proposed initiative petition with the  
lieutenant governor's office. If the Legislature doesn't force the 
IOC to share in the financial risks or call a public vote on state 
guarantees of public debt, the group will begin circulating the 
petition to put the issue on the 2000 general election ballot. It 
would need around 125,000 signatures. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years ago, the group failed to get enough signatures on an  
almost identical initiative petition. Pace hopes the scandal will 
give the effort new steam. ``The shock is just beginning to set in 
for the people,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The petition is phrased to say that Utah would not guarantee or  
reimburse the debt or obligations of any organization hosting the 
Olympic Winter Games. If voters approved it, Salt Lake City alone 
would be on the hook. 
</P>
<P>
	The city, by contract with the International Olympic Committee,  
is obligated to pay any debts left behind by the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah's governor in 1991 signed a contract saying the state would  
stand behind Salt Lake in meeting any shortfall, and current Gov. 
Mike Leavitt says the state has a moral obligation. Yet he 
acknowledges Utah's Constitution prohibits the state from 
guaranteeing a city's debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Pace believes Utah residents would vote to stop the Olympics,  
although that's not something his group can legally propose via an 
initiative drive. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the chance of dumping the games were put to the people this  
spring, I think they'd do it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC chairman Robert Garff has said he remains confident  
organizers can raise all the money they need to meet the $1.4 
billion budget 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Payne, IOC marketing director, also expressed confidence  
Monday. He said no sponsor had pulled out, and the amount raised 
through sponsorship to date is $900 million -- which is more than at 
this state for any other Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as Salt Lake City is concerned, let me say  
unequivocally that the sponsor issues are not putting the games in 
jeopardy,'' he said. ``The 2002 Salt Lake City Games will go on and 
will be extremely successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his state-of-the-state address Monday night, Leavitt noted  
Utah's ``relentless soul-searching'' over the scandal and its 
willingness to expose the mistakes and form new Olympic leadership. 
The IOC should do the same, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They must tell all, they must expel the offenders, they must  
change the bid process and return the Olympics to its place as a 
force of human ennoblement,'' Leavitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let history remember this as the cleansing moment when we all  
looked inward and returned the games to its roots of athleticism 
and altruism rather than money and materialism.''

<HEADLINE> Super Bowl Security Is Top Secret </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Football fans watching television on Super Bowl  
Sunday will see the fanfare of the game's biggest day. Chances are 
they won't see the covert operations of security personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	The men and women entrusted with the safety of the 75,000 fans  
at the stadium and the thousands of other visitors to this 
spotlight-hungry city will be prepared for everything from 
pickpockets to terrorists as they try to blend into the 
surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the public will never know what we did, but they will  
know that they enjoyed themselves and saw a good game,'' FBI 
spokesman Mike Fabregas said. 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to discuss the scope of the FBI's involvement or  
measures being taken to protect the crowds attending the Super Bowl 
on Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once you go into (discussing) your security detail, you don't  
have one,'' NFL spokesman Pete Abitante said, 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI and Emergency Management Services are just a few of the  
30 or so local, state and national agencies whose personnel are 
planning for every contingency and assessing all the ``what if'' 
scenarios. At least 327 officers, many undercover, will supplement 
2,500 security guards specifically trained for game day. 
</P>
<P>
	Evacuation plans are being mapped out for Pro Player Stadium as  
well as routes to the nearest hospital or trauma center. A plan is 
in place in case an expectant mother goes into labor or a child 
gets lost. And there is no shortage of plans for calming 
overzealous fans or intoxicated revelers. 
</P>
<P>
	Security experts who were willing to discuss plans and  
expectations for high-visibility events are not involved in the 
1999 Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a nightmare,'' said Reginald Rutherford, an operations  
manager for Don Cornelius Productions in California, whose security 
credits include the Academy Awards and the 1993 Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't ever know if you're picking up a bomb or a briefcase  
that someone has lost,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	With more than 1.3 billion expected TV viewers in 180 countries,  
the biggest game in sports becomes a compelling target. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a perfect venue to make a statement,'' said Lou Palumbo,  
a former law enforcement agent whose company, The Elite Group, 
Ltd., works with the Academy Awards and Golden Globe Awards and has 
handled soccer's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Knowles, director of community relations at the stadium,  
said beefed-up security is not just a one-day concern. Since 
Monday, he said, visitors to the stadium needed to have an 
appointment to get past the front gates. 
</P>
<P>
	Security experts say it's the glitches -- insufficient batteries  
for communication equipment, personnel who don't show up on time -- 
that can ruin a foolproof plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter what, there's always something last minute,'' said  
New Jersey-based security consultant Wendell Huggins. 
</P>
<P>
	But the challenge of the championship game is the length of the  
event and associated festivities, such as the weeklong NFL 
Experience and parties being held in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm 
Beach counties. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever you bring 75,000 people together, you have concerns  
for their safety,'' said Wilfredo Alvarez, an executive on the 
Super Bowl host committee. ``It's no different than (monitoring) 
the weather to make sure we're prepared for rain ... because those 
things will impact the event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's a much different picture this year than Alvarez's first  
Super Bowl in 1989, when race riots touched off by a deadly police 
shooting of a fleeing motorcyclist became a story during game week. 
</P>
<P>
	It's possible authorities had the Super Bowl in mind when they  
swept into the mostly poor Liberty City neighborhood over the 
Christmas holidays in an effort to end two months of gang struggle 
for control of the drug trade. The crackdown resulted in the 
capture of a reputed gang leader believed to be at the center of 
the turf war that left 12 people dead since August. 
</P>
<P>
	Palumbo said the trick to carrying out a good security plan is  
detail and efficiency -- without turning the host city into a police 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an exercise in cerebral superiority,'' he said. ``It's  
got nothing to do with muscle.''

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Testimony Could Be Risky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Both sides in President Clinton's impeachment  
trial could face big risks if Monica Lewinsky is called to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a nightmare for everybody. We hear so many stories about  
this woman; who knows what the truth is?'' says New York lawyer 
Gregory Joseph, former chairman of the American Bar Association's 
litigation section. 
</P>
<P>
	``In trials, stuff happens. It never plays live the way it does  
on paper,'' added Denver lawyer Larry Pozner, president of the 
National Association of Criminal Defense lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors want the Senate to call witnesses to help  
decide whether Clinton should be removed from office for what he 
did in covering up his affair with Ms. Lewinsky, a former White 
House intern. 
</P>
<P>
	Putting Ms. Lewinsky on the stand could backfire for the  
prosecutors if it turns into a ``sordid sex tell-all,'' said 
Pozner. But she could hurt Clinton too. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her testimony keeps alive the issue of perjury and the more  
troubling issue of obstruction of justice,'' said Edward Ohlbaum, a 
law professor and director of the trial advocacy program at Temple 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	Although many have read her grand jury testimony and heard her  
voice in tape-recorded conversations with Linda Tripp, ``You don't 
know how she's going to come across testifying publicly,'' said 
Washington lawyer Barbara Nicastro. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyers would get a chance to judge her demeanor ahead of  
time. The Senate trial agreement says witnesses will be called to 
testify only if both sides get a chance to question them in 
advance. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky herself faces no risk, aside from the embarrassment  
of having to testify, as long as she tells the truth. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for immunity from prosecution, she promised  
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr last July she would testify 
truthfully in court and in ``congressional proceedings.'' Because 
of the immunity deal, she can't rely on the Constitution's Fifth 
Amendment protection against self-incrimination to avoid 
testifying. 
</P>
<P>
	But if she lies, the agreement can be voided and she can be  
prosecuted for perjury. Therefore, she would be expected to stick 
closely to her previous testimony in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	New York trial lawyer Gerald Lefcourt said Clinton's lawyers can  
try to reinforce Ms. Lewinsky's statement to the grand jury that 
``No one ever asked me to lie and I was never promised a job for my 
silence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors can ask about her statement that even though Clinton  
did not tell her to lie, he also did not urge her to tell the 
truth. ``I knew what that meant,'' she told the grand jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors can ask about presidential secretary Betty Currie's  
retrieval of gifts Clinton gave Ms. Lewinsky. And they can try to 
use her testimony to bolster their argument that Clinton lied about 
details of their physical relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	They could do that ``in a G-rated way'' by simply asking her to  
confirm that her grand jury testimony on that question was 
truthful, said John Barrett, a New York University law professor 
and former prosecutor in the Iran-Contra arms and money scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Several lawyers predicted attorneys on both sides will question  
Ms. Lewinsky cautiously to avoid seeming to abuse her, but Barrett 
said they must be ready to be more aggressive if her testimony 
seems to favor the other side. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the worst things that could happen to the prosecution,  
Pozner said, would be if she were to ``look up and say, 'I said 
before no one pressured me.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicastro said Ms. Lewinsky could harm the president by  
testifying that she got a clear impression he wanted her to 
continue covering up the affair as they had before. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Ms. Lewinsky's testimony did not change the known facts  
in a major way, ``The exercise will at least allow the Senate to 
size her up -- test her credibility, memory, motivations, attitude, 
maturity and perception,'' Barrett said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's how live testimony goes. It's always a bit of a wild  
card,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Team Unlike House Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The team of seven lawyers defending President  
Clinton was put together gradually through years of scandal, from 
Whitewater to campaign fund raising to Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	As a group, they stand in contrast to the 13 white congressmen  
the House sent to manage the prosecution. There are two women at 
the defense table; one of them, Cheryl Mills, is black. The team's 
leader, Charles Ruff, uses a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
	Three were called to testify as witnesses in Independent Counsel  
Kenneth Starr's grand jury investigation of the Lewinsky affair and 
alleged cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
	The president was grappling with other troubles -- Whitewater,  
Paula Jones' lawsuit, foreign fund raising -- when Ruff arrived as 
Clinton's fifth White House counsel in January 1997. Despite 
intense pressure, Ruff seems to relish his sensitive mission, 
calling it ``the most exciting job I've ever had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff's presentations are typically direct, forceful in a low-key  
way, and heavy on logic. He surprised many people when he conceded, 
at a House Judiciary Committee hearing, that reasonable people 
might determine that the president testified falsely under oath. 
But Ruff insisted Clinton didn't intend to lie. 
</P>
<P>
	A former Watergate prosecutor, he is known as an expert in  
white-collar criminal law whose clients have included Sen. Charles 
Robb, D-Va., and former Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio. Ruff, 59, 
contracted a paralyzing disease while working in Africa in the 
1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's dour-faced and scholarly personal attorney, David  
Kendall, has tussled with Starr since Starr was named independent 
counsel to investigate Whitewater in 1994. Although he prefers to 
work quietly behind the scenes, it was Kendall who pounded Starr 
with questions about his prosecutorial tactics at a House Judiciary 
Committee hearing. On Thursday, Kendall, 54, will present Clinton's 
defense on obstruction of justice charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall, raised a Quaker in Indiana, became friends with Hillary  
Rodham and Bill Clinton at Yale Law School. He has represented a 
diverse group of clients, including the tabloid National Enquirer 
and The Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall's law partner, Nicole Seligman, 42, is also helping the  
defense. She's perhaps best known as one of Oliver North's lawyers 
during the Iran-Contra scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their vaunted legal skills, Kendall and Ruff have been  
accused of lacking political acumen. That's where Gregory Craig 
comes in. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig, another Yale friend of the Clintons, was added to the  
anti-impeachment team last year as its political strategist and its 
public face. Before coming to the White House, Craig, 53, held a 
senior post in the State Department, worked for Sen. Edward 
Kennedy, D-Mass., and helped defend John W. Hinckley Jr. after he 
tried to assassinate President Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
	Mills, on the other hand, rarely speaks publicly. Known as a  
devoted protector of the president and first lady, she has served 
in the White House since Clinton took office. 
</P>
<P>
	Mills, who plans to argue part of Clinton's defense against  
obstruction of justice charges, counts two key witnesses to the 
alleged cover-up among her friends -- Betty Currie and Vernon 
Jordan. She testified before Starr's grand jury about her contacts 
with Mrs. Currie and Jordan as events at issue in the case were 
unfolding. 
</P>
<P>
	Mills, 33, has come under attack from House Republicans who  
questioned her truthfulness during a congressional probe of 
allegations that White House computer files were misused to aid 
Clinton's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Seligman and two others at the defense table aren't expected to  
speak during the trial's opening phase. Deputy White House counsel 
Bruce Lindsey, Clinton's confidant and closest adviser for three 
decades, has weathered every political storm but seldom spoken out. 
The White House fought all the way to the Supreme Court, and lost, 
to prevent Lindsey's testimony before Starr's grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Lanny Breuer's best-known cases as a private attorney was  
a successful lawsuit against the Clinton administration on behalf 
of a gay Marine who broke Pentagon rules. He was recruited to the 
Clinton damage-control team from Ruff's former law firm, Covington 
and Burling, in 1997, and works mostly in the background. 
</P>
<P>
	Breuer, 40, also was called before Starr's grand jury.

<HEADLINE>  Knicks To Acquire Latrell Sprewell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Knicks apparently emerged as the  
winning bidder in the Latrell Sprewell auction, and the three-time 
All-Star is expected to be dealt to New York as soon as the lockout 
ends, sources told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Two league sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the  
Knicks beat out the Miami Heat and Indiana Pacers in the bidding 
for Sprewell, whose attack on Golden State Warriors coach P.J. 
Carlesimo last season led to one of the harshest penalties in NBA 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	However, The New York Times and San Jose Mercury News reported  
today that Seattle and Portland might still be in the running after 
making last-minute bids for the guard. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear who the Knicks would send to the  
Warriors. New York was believed to be offering forward Chris Mills 
and guard Chris Childs, with Golden State general manager Garry St. 
Jean asking for John Starks. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Jean told all interested teams to make their best offers by  
4 p.m. EST Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal would work under salary cap guidelines if any two of  
the three Knicks were packaged together. Sprewell was due to make 
$8.3 million this season, while Childs makes $3.64 million, Mills 
makes $3.6 million and Starks makes $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Knicks, Sprewell would play alongside the Knicks' other  
shooting guard, Allan Houston, in a three-guard formation much like 
New York used for most of last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks, Heat and Pacers had been known to be the leading  
bidders in the Sprewell sweepstakes, and the AP learned that a 
complicated four-team trade involving Golden State, Miami, 
Cleveland and Boston also was discussed. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell would have gone to the Heat along with Bimbo Coles and  
Clarence Weatherspoon, with Golden State getting Brent Barry, Dan 
Majerle and Bobby Sura. Boston would have received Jamal Mashburn 
and Vitaly Potapenko, and Cleveland would have received Paul Pierce 
and Andrew Declercq. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the league's most notorious choke artist -- as Sprewell  
has come to be known for obvious reasons -- will be playing in the 
harsh spotlight of the nation's media capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell has averaged 20.1 points over his six-year career,  
including a career-high 24.2 points in 1996-97. 
</P>
<P>
	He was suspended for one year and had his contract terminated by  
the Warriors for his attack on coach Carlesimo in December 1997, 
although an arbitrator reduced the suspension to 68 games and 
reinstated the final two years of his contract after a hearing last 
February. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell will make $9 million next season, but more importantly  
will elevate the Knicks to the status of top Eastern Conference 
contender for the upcoming season. 
</P>
<P>
	No deals can be finalized until the lockout settlement is put  
into writing, which won't happen until Tuesday night at the 
earliest. If the deal is finalized Tuesday night, trades and free 
agent signings will begin Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Brokerages Have Good Fourth Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Investment banks and brokerages easily beat Wall  
Street's profit estimates for the final quarter of 1998, rebounding 
from the beating the industry took during the turbulent third 
quarter, but most fell short of their year-end results for 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Several investment banks took charges in the quarter to cover  
the cost laying off hundreds of workers after alarming trading 
losses during the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry's exception was Charles Schwab, which reported  
record numbers. The discount broker rode the Internet wave. As more 
small, retail investors bought stocks and mutual funds online, 
Schwab was an early convert. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of 1998, Schwab had 2.2 million online accounts with  
$174 billion in assets. Online trading accounted for 61 percent of 
the firm's daily trading, up from 41 percent in 1997. 
</P>

	The industry leader, based in New York, reported profits of $359  
million, or 86 cents a diluted share, for the fourth quarter,

	SEATTLE (AP) -- Microsoft outperformed analysts' estimates for  
second-quarter profits as strong growth in personal computer 
shipments boosted demand for its software. Microsoft had net income

<HEADLINE> Clinton Invites Guests to Address </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A teacher involved in a gun safety program, a  
Vietnamese refugee who mentors high school students and a mother 
fighting to prevent school violence were among the guests invited 
to President Clinton's State of the Union address on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Joanna Quintana-Barroso, Loc Truong and Suzann Wilson sat with  
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton as Clinton delivered his annual 
speech to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Barroso teaches third grade at Little Havana's Coral Way  
Elementary School, a school with innovative programs including 
alternative education classes for at-risk children, a Stop the 
Violence Day and Drug Awareness Week. 
</P>
<P>
	The 29-year-old teacher has also been involved with the school's  
curriculum-based gun safety program, which encourages students to 
stay away from guns and violence with weapons by having them sign a 
symbolic pledge. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a city school with a realistic perspective on what's  
going on,'' she said of the K-5 elementary school where she has 
taught for seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	Truong, 23, mentors students at San Luis Obispo High School in  
California through AmeriCorps, the president's domestic volunteer 
program. He works with eight students, helping them with homework, 
looking for jobs and serving as a role model for appropriate 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	He moved to San Luis Obispo 18 years ago after leaving his  
native Vietnam on a boat with his parents and seven siblings. Two 
years ago, he graduated from college with a degree in biochemistry, 
with the intention of becoming a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	But his experiences with Americorps during the past two years  
have persuaded him to become a high school principal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just love working with kids,'' he said. ``That is where my  
passion is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Wilson called for stronger laws to prevent school violence  
after her daughter was among those slain in last year's school 
shooting in Jonesboro, Ark. Her 11-year-old daughter, Britthney 
Varner, three other students and a teacher were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Wilson said after the shootings that she wanted to do  
something positive, such as keeping children away from firearms. 
Ms. Wilson and her sister, Regina Kaut, created People Against 
Violence Everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	In the months after the shootings, Ms. Wilson made her case  
before Arkansas legislators. Gov. Mike Huckabee formed a citizen's 
group to make recommendations on how to reform the state's juvenile 
justice system.

<HEADLINE> Drug Flap Volleys Across Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- The country-club chumminess of men's  
tennis is dissolving into a den of dissension, with players lobbing 
charges at each other amid calls for stronger drug rules and a 
change in ATP Tour leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	An already foul mood among the players at the start of the  
Australian Open, touched off by the Petr Korda drug controversy, 
turned downright nasty Tuesday when Jim Courier alleged many 
players, especially Europeans, may be guilty of blood doping. 
</P>
<P>
	Austria's Thomas Muster challenged Courier to name names, then  
assailed ATP Tour chief executive officer Mark Miles for his ``very 
weak'' leadership on the drug issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Korda kept his silence on the ``exceptional circumstances'' that  
allowed him to escape a one-year suspension when he appealed his 
positive test for the anabolic steroid Nandrolone at Wimbledon last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	But the man Korda beat in the first round, Spain's Galo Blanco,  
accused the Czech of lying and faking a sprained ankle to take a 
rest during the third set of their five-setter. Blanco refused to 
offer the customary handshake after the match. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't trust Korda,'' Blanco said, ``so I didn't want to  
shake his hand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andre Agassi, for one, wanted Korda to explain the reasons he  
gave the appeals panel when he asked for leniency. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish everybody could know his innocence or his guilt,''  
Agassi said. ``I don't think anybody appreciates the confusion in 
it. We have rules in our sport that need to be enforced and 
respected. I don't think it's healthy for the game when players 
don't have the security that the rules are being properly 
enforced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Courier hit a nerve with everyone when he charged that blood  
doping may be more prevalent in tennis than steroid use. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have a great suspicion of steroid use among players,''  
Courier said. ``I'm much more inclined to have a concern for 
something that we cannot test for under the current system, which 
is blood doping.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blood doping, the withdrawal and reintroduction of an athlete's  
own blood to boost oxygen in red cells and enhance performance, has 
been associated more with endurance sports like cycling in the Tour 
de France. 
</P>
<P>
	Certain drugs, notably erythropoietin (EPO), produce the same  
effect and have been widely used by cyclists. Now, Courier 
believes, some European tennis players are taking EPO and eluding 
detection in urine tests because it is a naturally occurring 
substance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I mean when almost half of the Tour de France last year was  
booted out for doing that type of nonsense, it's clearly prevalent 
in European sports. And most of our tour is in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``By deduction -- and I'm throwing darts, I have no proof, I  
can't name names, I wouldn't bother naming names -- but it just 
seems a logical way for a player to improve himself. I'll be pretty 
(ticked) off in 10 years if I find people were doing that and I was 
losing to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That kind of dart-throwing brought an angry response from  
Muster. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we are pretty much on the edge of destroying the sport  
by making comments like that,'' Muster said. ``If you don't have 
proof, you shouldn't say things like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ATP Players Council president Todd Martin doubted blood doping  
or the use of EPO were common in tennis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe I'm a little naive. I hope it is not widespread,''  
Martin said. ``Until it can be proven that it is widespread, I am 
going to give the guys the benefit of the doubt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He acknowledged, though, that players were talking about the  
possibility of introducing blood testing in addition to urinalysis 
in an effort to clamp down on all forms of drug use. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would be great if we had blood tests three or four  
times a year,'' said Britain's Greg Rusedski, ``because the 
problems are EPO and growth hormone and stuff like that, which 
can't really be detected with urine tests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Muster laid much of the blame on the ATP Tour leadership. Korda  
never should have been allowed to compete in any tournament after 
he tested positive, Muster said, and should be forced to sit out 
until his appeal is finally resolved by the Committee for 
Arbitration in Sport in Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way this whole thing is being handled is pretty weak, and  
the way the ATP meeting (Saturday night) went was very weak,'' 
Muster said. ``I lost all belief that we have someone behind the 
players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Muster made it clear that he was talking about Miles, who has  
been CEO of the tour since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida-based ATP Tour, Muster said, is ``a big company  
where the left doesn't know what the right does. ... I have been in 
the council, I have been at meetings, and it's shocking. That's why 
I am not on the council anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Muster criticized Miles for jumping around on issues, from  
on-court coaching and player conduct to shifting relations with the 
International Tennis Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are so many things which are ridiculous at the moment,''  
Muster said. ``I just don't understand it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miles shrugged off Muster's personal attack.  
</P>
<P>
	``Thomas and I have had differences of opinion in the past, so  
it's probably not unique,'' he said. ``I share the players' 
frustration at what appears to be a flawed judgment by the appeal 
panel.''

<HEADLINE>  Bulls' Dennis Rodman To Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dennis Rodman, the colorful and controversial  
seven-time NBA rebounding leader, has decided to retire from 
professional basketball, his agent said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't want to play,'' agent Dwight Manley said. ``He  
wants to go into the sports and entertainment field. Some people 
have convinced him that he wants to become a movie star.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manley said the Chicago Bulls forward gave him the news late  
this afternoon over the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	He is retiring even though several teams are interested in him,  
Manley said. He declined to be specific. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that would be fair to those teams,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Rodman won three championships with the Chicago Bulls in 1996,  
1997 and 1998, and two titles with the Detroit Pistons in 1989 and 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
	His career was also marked by his outrageous antics, from dating  
Madonna to flying off to gamble in Las Vegas several times a month 
to marrying actress Carmen Electra to seeking an annulment to 
dressing in drag at his book signing. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman also made an appearance as a professional wrestler over  
the summer and said he would like to continue doing that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to represent him anymore,'' said Manley, who was  
obviously miffed at his star client's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Manley refused to predict whether Rodman would change his mind,  
but said his decision to stop representing him ``is irreversible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman's retirement brings further drama to the breakup of the  
Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past week, Michael Jordan has retired and Scottie Pippen,  
Luc Longley and Steve Kerr have agreed to sign-and-trade deals 
sending them to Houston, Phoenix and San Antonio, respectively.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Address-2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *UNDATED: 21st century.    	
</P>
<P>
	I propose that we use a little over 11 percent of the surplus to  
establish universal savings accounts -- USA accounts -- to give all 
Americans the means to save. With these new accounts, Americans can 
invest as they choose, and receive funds to match a portion of 
their savings, with extra help for those least able to save. 
</P>
<P>
	USA accounts will help all Americans to share in our nation's  
wealth, and to enjoy a more secure retirement. I ask you to support 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourth, we must invest in long-term care. I propose -- I propose  
a tax credit of $1,000 for the aged, ailing or disabled and the 
families who care for them. Long-term care will become a bigger and 
bigger challenge with the aging of America -- and we must do more to 
help our families deal with it. 
</P>
<P>
	I was born in 1946, the first year of the baby boom. I can tell  
you that one of the greatest concerns of our generation is our 
absolute determination not to let our growing old place an 
intolerable burden on our children and their ability to raise our 
grandchildren. Our economic success and fiscal discipline now give 
us an opportunity to lift that burden from their shoulders and we 
should take it. 
</P>
<P>
	Saving Social Security and Medicare, creating USA accounts --  
this is the right way to use the surplus. If we do so -- if we do so 
-- we will still have the resources to meet critical needs in 
education and defense. And I want to point out that this proposal 
is fiscally sound. Listen to this: If we set aside 60 percent of 
the surplus for Social Security and 16 percent for Medicare, over 
the next 15 years that saving will achieve the lowest level of 
publicly held debt since right before World War I, in 1917. 
</P>
<P>
	So With these four measures -- saving Social Security,  
strengthening Medicare, establishing the USA accounts, supporting 
long-term care -- we can begin to meet our generation's historic 
responsibility to establish true security for 21st century seniors. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, there are more children, from more diverse backgrounds, in  
our public schools than at any time in our history. Their education 
must provide the knowledge and nurture the creativity that will 
allow our nation to thrive in the new economy. Today we can say 
something we couldn't say six years ago: With tax credits and more 
affordable student loans, with more work-study grants and more Pell 
grants, with education IRAs and the new HOPE scholarship tax cut 
that more than 5 million Americans will receive this year, we have 
opened the doors of college to all Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Thank you.  
</P>
<P>
	With our support, nearly every state has set higher academic  
standards for public schools, and a voluntary national test is 
being developed to measure the progress of our students. With over 
one billion dollars in discounts available this year, we are well 
on our way to our goal of connecting every classroom and library to 
the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, you passed our proposal to start hiring 100,000 new  
teachers to reduce class size in the early grades. Now I ask you to 
finish the job. 
</P>
<P>
	You know, our children are doing better. SAT scores are up. Math  
scores have risen in nearly all grades. But there's a problem: 
While our fourth-graders outperform their peers in other countries 
in math and science, our eighth-graders are around average, and our 
12th-graders rank near the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
	We must do better. Now each year the national government invests  
more than $15 billion in our public schools. I believe we must 
change the way we invest that money, to support what works and to 
stop supporting what does not work. 
</P>
<P>
	First, later this year, I will send Congress a plan that for the  
first time holds states and school districts accountable for 
progress and rewards them for results. My Education Accountability 
Act will require every school district receiving federal help to 
take the following five steps: 
</P>
<P>
	First, all schools must end social promotion.  
</P>
<P>
	Now, no child should graduate from high school with a diploma he  
or she can't read. We do our children no favors when we allow them 
to pass from grade to grade without mastering the material. 
</P>
<P>
	But we can't just hold students back because the system fails  
them. So my balanced budget triples the funding for summer school 
and after-school programs to keep a million children learning. 
</P>
<P>
	If you doubt this will work, just look at Chicago, which ended  
social promotion and made summer school mandatory for those who 
don't master the basics. Math and reading scores are up three years 
running -- with some of the biggest gains in some of the poorest 
neighborhoods. It will work and we should do it. 
</P>
<P>
	Second, all states and school districts must turn around their  
worst performing schools -- or shut them down. That's the policy 
established in North Carolina by Gov. Jim Hunt. North Carolina, 
made the biggest gains in test scores in the nation last year. Our 
budget includes $200 million to help states turn around their own 
failing schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Third, all states and school districts must be held responsible  
for the quality of their teachers. The great majority of teachers 
do a fine job. But in too many schools, teachers don't have college 
majors -- or even minors -- in the subjects they teach. 
</P>
<P>
	New teachers should be required to pass performance exams, and  
all teachers should know the subjects they are teaching. This 
year's balanced budget contains new resources to help them reach 
higher standards. 
</P>
<P>
	And to attract talented young teachers to the toughest  
assignments, I recommend a sixfold increase in our program for 
college scholarships for students who commit to teach in the inner 
cities, and isolated rural areas and in Indian communities. Let us 
bring excellence to every part of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Thank you.  
</P>
<P>
	Fourth, we must empower parents with more information and more  
choices. In too many communities, it is easier to get information 
on the quality of the local restaurants than on the quality of the 
local schools. Every school district should issue report cards on 
every school. 
</P>
<P>
	And parents should have more choice in selecting their public  
schools. When I became president, there was one independent, public 
charter school in all of America. With our support, on a bipartisan 
basis, today there are 1,100. My budget assures that early in the 
next century, there will be 3,000.

<HEADLINE> Montreal Stadium To Be Repaired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- Montreal's glitch-plagued Olympic Stadium will  
be closed for at least a month after a large section of its roof 
crashed to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said Tuesday that an auto show scheduled for this  
weekend and a boat show planned next month would be canceled 
because of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Five people were injured Monday when a panel of the roof gave  
way under the weight of wet snow. About 200 people were in the 
stadium at the time, setting up the auto show. 
</P>
<P>
	Birdair, the U.S. company that made the $24 million roof, must  
now file a series of reports with Montreal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The Montreal Expos, who play their home games at the stadium and  
want a new baseball-only ballpark, hope the roof problems will be 
solved by the time they start their season in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Expos manager Felipe Alou seemed to take the problems in in  
stride. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe I won't be going out to change the pitcher too many  
times,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Montrealers interviewed by the local media Tuesday  
suggested it was time to tear down the stadium, the most visible 
legacy of the 1976 Olympic Games that left the city with a 
still-outstanding debt. 
</P>
<P>
	A Montreal demolition company estimated it would take a year to  
tear the stadium down and cost about $3 million.

<HEADLINE> 15 Players Settle Arbitration Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Andy Pettitte and 14 other players don't have to  
worry about salary arbitration anymore this winter, agreeing to 
contracts Tuesday just before teams and players exchanged numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	Pettitte agreed to a $5.95 million, one-year contract, up from  
$3.8 million last year, and has the chance to earn $50,000 more in 
bonuses: $25,000 for pitching 200 innings and $25,000 for making 
the AL All-Star team. 
</P>
<P>
	Pettitte, a 26-year-old left-hander, was 16-11 with a 4.24 ERA  
in 1998, struggling with his control and mechanics for much of the 
season. He came up big in the World Series, pitching 7 1-3 shutout 
innings to win Game 4 as the Yankees completed their sweep of San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad. I like Pettitte,'' Yankees owner George Steinbrenner  
said at the NHL game between Buffalo and Tampa Bay. ``I didn't want 
any troubles with him. Nobody did, because we really like him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Pettitte, Houston right-hander Jay Powell got a  
$3.65 million, three-year contract and seven right-handed pitchers 
agreed to one-year deals: Montreal's Dustin Hermanson ($2.05 
million), James Baldwin of the Chicago White Sox ($1.9 million), 
the Dodgers' Darren Dreifort ($1.9 million), Houston's Sean Bergman 
($1,875,000), Anaheim's Steve Sparks ($1.35 million), Detroit's 
Bryce Florie ($1.3 million) and Oakland's T.J. Mathews ($750,000). 
</P>
<P>
	Also agreeing to one-year contracts were Cubs infielder Jose  
Hernandez ($2.4 million) and catcher Tyler Houston ($715,000); 
Philadelphia left-hander Paul Spoljaric ($750,000); Texas catcher 
Gregg Zaun ($425,000); and Tampa Bay left-hander Terrell Wade 
($250,000) 
</P>
<P>
	After reaching a tentative deal earlier in the day, the New York  
Mets and right-hander Jason Isringhausen finalized a $350,000, 
one-year contract that includes incentive bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Among free agents, the Mets agreed to a $750,000, one-year  
contract with left-hander Allen Watson, Minnesota agreed to a minor 
league contract with right-hander Bob Wells and Toronto agreed to a 
minor league contract with right-hander Vincente Palacios.

<HEADLINE> McEnroe Named to Tennis Hall of Fame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- John McEnroe, winner of four U.S. Open titles  
and three Wimbledon crowns, was elected into the International 
Tennis Hall of Fame today. 
</P>
<P>
	Also voted into the Hall was Ken McGregor of Australia. He was  
elected as a Master Player. The two will be inducted into the Hall 
of Fame at Newport, R.I., July 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The youngest player to reach the No. 1 ranking, McEnroe burst  
onto the tennis scene at the French Open in 1977 when he teamed 
with Mary Carillo to win the mixed doubles title. 
</P>
<P>
	When he wasn't battling officials, McEnroe produced great  
tennis, starting with well-placed serves and usually ending with 
sharp volleys. 
</P>
<P>
	Equally skilled in singles and doubles, McEnroe won 77 titles in  
each. Among his 17 major crowns were Wimbledon singles 
championships in 1981, '83 and '84, and U.S. Open singles titles in 
1979-81 and '84. 
</P>
<P>
	He paired with Peter Fleming for doubles champinships at  
Wimbledon in 1979, '81, '83 and '84, and at the U.S. Open in '79, 
'81 and '83. He teamed with Michael Stich to win Wimbledon in '92 
and with Mark Woodforde to capture the U.S. Open in '89. 
</P>
<P>
	As a member of the U.S. Davis Cup team, McEnroe compiled a 59-10  
overall record in 12 years. He was the ATP Tour's Player of the 
Year in '81, '83 and '84, and he and Fleming won Doubles Team of 
the Year honors in '79 and '81. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1980 at the age of 21 years, 15 days, McEnroe became the  
youngest player to achieve the No. 1 ranking. During his career, he 
was the top-ranked men's player for a total of 170 weeks, and 
finished as the No. 1 player four straight years from 1981-84. 
</P>
<P>
	McGregor was an integral member of the 1950 Australian Davis Cup  
team that ended the United States' four-year possession of the Cup. 
The Aussies also won the international team trophy in 1951 and '52. 
</P>
<P>
	McGregor teamed with countryman and Hall of Famer Frank Sedgman  
to complete the only male Grand Slam in doubles in 1951, and the 
duo won three of the four majors the following year. McGregor also 
won the U.S. mixed doubles championship with Hall of Famer Margaret 
Osborne duPont in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
	In singles, McGregor was ranked in the top 10 from 1950-52 and  
won the Australian title in 1952, defeating Sedgman in the final.

	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United Nations Children's Fund  
appealed to donors Tuesday for $136 million in emergency assistance 
to help nearly 50 million children and women who are victims of 
war, natural disasters and poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency also appealed to the U.N. Security Council to

emergency situations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Children and women are not only the first casualties in armed  
conflicts, they are being deliberately targeted and are being 
forced to take part in these conflicts as well,'' UNICEF Executive 
Director Carol Bellamy said. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Congo Rebels Say Peace Not in Sight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOMA, Congo (AP) -- Congolese rebels who have been trying to  
topple President Laurent Kabila for five months said today that 
they would not lay down their arms until Kabila meets them at the 
negotiating table. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels said they would pay little heed to a cease-fire  
commitment reached by five African nations that have sent troops 
into Congo to fight either for or against Kabila. 
</P>
<P>
	Without direct negotiations, ``we will remove Kabila  
militarily,'' Bizima Karaha, a rebel leader, said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Congo rebels took up arms five months ago, troops from  
Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad have joined Kabila, while Rwanda 
and Uganda support the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	Rwanda and Uganda agreed Monday in the Namibian capital,  
Windhoek, to sign a cease-fire accord at a later date with Angola, 
Zimbabwe and Namibia. Chad did not send representatives to those 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Namibian President Sam Nujoma said after the one-day summit that  
the cease-fire would be signed by all parties, including the 
rebels, in Lusaka, Zambia. Neither Kabila nor the rebels 
participated in the Windhoek talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only direct negotiations will do,'' Karaha said. ``The  
agreement on a cease-fire is good for the foreign countries, and it 
may be good for the people of Congo, if it brings us a step closer 
to direct negotiations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Kabila has refused to negotiate with the rebels, a  
coalition of ethnic Tutsis, disaffected Congolese soldiers and 
opposition politicians. Kabila accuses them of being puppets of 
Rwanda and Uganda. 
</P>
<P>
	Both countries, which helped topple former dictator Mobutu Sese  
Seko and install Kabila in power in May 1997, now accuse Kabila of 
being in league with thousands of Rwandan and Ugandan rebels and 
failing to secure their western borders, where the rebels cross in 
and out of Congo. 
</P>
<P>
	Since they took up arms in August, the Congolese rebels have  
advanced to the eastern half of Africa's third-largest nation.

<HEADLINE> Boeing To Sell Light 'Copter Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Boeing announced today that it has agreed to sell  
the light helicopter product lines it acquired in its merger with 
McDonnell Douglas to a subsidiary of RDM, a European industrial 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale divests Boeing of all the civil and commercial  
helicopter products it inherited in the 1997 merger. Boeing will 
remain in the military helicopter business. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, MD Helicopters Holding Inc., an indirect  
subsidiary of RDM, will buy Boeing's MD-500, MD-600N and MD 
Explorer series of helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale price was not disclosed. The deal, which is subject to  
approval by the Federal Trade Commission, is expected to be 
completed by mid-February. 
</P>
<P>
	MD Helicopters said it will initially continue to assemble the  
helicopters at the existing Boeing plant at Falcon Field Airport in 
Mesa, Ariz., but would build its own facilities in Mesa later. No 
real estate is included in the deal, Boeing officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	MD Helicopters will offer jobs to Boeing employees who work on  
the same product lines, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	RDM, a defense and aerospace company, is a subcontractor to  
Boeing for landing gear and fuselage assemblies for Apache attack 
helicopters, which are assembled at Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing delivered 36 helicopters from its commercial product  
lines in 1998, up from 30 delivered in 1997. It took orders for 22 
helicopters in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Boeing reached agreement to sell the MD-500 and  
MD-600 lines to Bell Helicopter Textron, but the deal was called 
off following questions by the FTC. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the AH-64 Apache, Boeing's military helicopters  
include the RAH-66 Comanche, CH-47 Chinook and V-22 Osprey 
tiltrotor, all built near Philadelphia.

<HEADLINE> Court KOs Trade Center Case Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One of four men convicted of the 1993 bombing  
at the World Trade Center in New York City lost a Supreme Court 
appeal today. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices turned away arguments that Mahmoud Abouhalima was  
denied a fair trial when convicted of helping bring about the 
explosion that killed six people and injured more than 1,000 more. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's action, taken without comment, left intact a ruling in  
which the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last August said all 
four militant Muslims had received a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
	While upholding the convictions, the appeals court did order  
resentencing because the four did not have lawyers when each was 
sentenced to 240 years in prison. They had lawyers during their 
six-month trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The four, arrested weeks after the Feb. 26, 1993, bombing of the  
110-story twin towers, said they sought to avenge U.S. support for 
Israel and to protest this nation's foreign policy in the Middle 
East. 
</P>
<P>
	Abouhalima's appeal to the nation's highest court said the trial  
was tainted by, among other things, a prosecutor's improper closing 
argument to the jury and the presiding judge's apparent hostility 
toward the defendants. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeal also contended that Abouhalima's conviction was based  
on ``equivocal circumstantial inferences'' of his role in the 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Abouhalima vs. U.S., 98-7145.

<HEADLINE> Finnish IOC Member Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- A Finnish member of the IOC  
resigned today, the first member of the international committee to 
step down in the widening bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Olympic Committee said that Pirjo Haeggman,  
one of 13 members it is investigating, presented her resignation to 
IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC president thanks Mrs. Haeggman for all the services  
which she gave to the Olympic movement as an athlete and as a 
member of the organization,'' an IOC statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Haeggman, 47, was an IOC member since 1981 and one of the first  
two women on the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	A middle-distance runner in the 1972, '76 and '80 Olympics, she  
was 12-time Finnish champion at 100 and 400 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	Haeggman's ex-husband, Bjarne, reportedly worked briefly for the  
Salt Lake bid committee and for 20 months in an Ontario government 
job initiated by the Toronto committee bidding for the 1996 Summer 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Paul Henderson, who was head of the Toronto bid,  
said his organization paid the $650-a-month rent in Sault Ste. 
Marie, Ontario, for Haeggman and her ex-husband. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson said in an e-mail sent Monday to Toronto news media  
that the money was to be repaid to the Toronto committee and was 
neither a gift nor an attempt to win the IOC member's vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch knew of and approved the payments, according to  
Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Toronto bid chief said he did not know if Haeggman ever  
reimbursed the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Haeggman is only the second IOC member to resign in a scandal.  
Robert Helmick stepped down in 1991 as an IOC member and president 
of the U.S. Olympic Committee amid allegations of conflict of 
interest in contracts with sports associations. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, IOC officials said their investigation into the  
allegations of corruption will extend beyond Salt Lake's efforts to 
secure the Winter Olympics to bids made by other cities in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC director general Francois Carrard said a six-member IOC  
investigating commission is determined ``to look at every piece of 
evidence'' concerning graft, bribery and vote-buying allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	He was quoted by The Washington Post as saying the inquiry no  
longer is confined to Salt Lake City's bid but that investigators 
are gathering facts worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	People involved in other cities' Olympic bids recently have come  
forward with assertions that some IOC members suggested that how 
they would vote might hinge on how well they were treated. 
</P>
<P>
	``For many years, there were rumors. We have never been able to  
have the beginning of evidence,'' Carrard said. ``We had 
allegations; we had hearsay. When we tried to get evidence, we 
always faced a wall of silence, even by people who said publicly 
they would disclose certain things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, due to the Salt Lake City scandal, Carrard said, the IOC is  
for the first time uncovering hard facts, including ``names, 
amounts, account numbers and access to files and documents from 
where we could go on with the investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC's panel, led by vice president Dick Pound of Canada, has  
asked 13 IOC members to explain actions by themselves or members of 
their families. Samaranch says nine cases are serious enough to 
possibly lead to expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC executive board will recommend action Jan. 24, with the  
full 115-member IOC called into special session March 17-18 to 
decide their fate and consider changes in the bidding process. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound, interviewed on ABC's ``Nightline'' Monday night, said  
that before the March meeting, ``we will write to the leaders of 
all the bid committees in recent games ... and ask them to come 
forward now that they can see we're serious'' about getting rid of 
the bad apples. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe they'll come forward. Maybe we'll find some additional  
names. Maybe we'll find the same people,'' he said. ``It's not 
something we're shirking. It's going to be painful and it's 
embarrassing but we're going to come out of it, I think, a stronger 
and better Olympics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Utah, Olympic critics demanded a statewide vote on whether  
taxpayers are willing to accept potential financial liability. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar initiative effort four years ago was unsuccessful, but  
that was before the scandal over Salt Lake Olympics officials' 
distributing hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, scholarships 
and gifts to IOC members and their relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Utahns for Responsible Public Spending is not sure even a  
stronger, better Olympics should be in Utah, particularly if its 
taxpayers may have to foot part of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've gotta figure out who's going to pay and quit pointing  
fingers at each other,'' said Stephen Pace, head of the group 
critical of Utah holding the games. ``The governor says the state 
has a moral obligation. Do voters believe they do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The group filed a proposed initiative petition with the  
lieutenant governor's office. If the Legislature doesn't force the 
IOC to share in the financial risks or call a public vote on state 
guarantees of public debt, the group will begin circulating the 
petition to put the issue on the 2000 general election ballot. It 
would need around 125,000 signatures. 
</P>
<P>
	The city, by contract with the IOC, is obligated to pay any  
debts left behind by the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah's governor in 1991 signed a contract saying the state would  
stand behind Salt Lake in meeting any shortfall, and current Gov. 
Mike Leavitt says the state has a moral obligation. Yet he 
acknowledges Utah's Constitution prohibits the state from 
guaranteeing a city's debt. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC chairman Robert Garff has said he remains confident  
organizers can raise all the money they need to meet the $1.4 
billion budget 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Payne, IOC marketing director, said no sponsor had  
pulled out, and the amount raised through sponsorship to date is 
$900 million -- more than at this point for any other Winter 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as Salt Lake City is concerned, let me say  
unequivocally that the sponsor issues are not putting the games in 
jeopardy,'' he said. ``The 2002 Salt Lake City Games will go on and 
will be extremely successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his state-of-the-state address Monday night, Leavitt noted  
Utah's ``relentless soul-searching'' over the scandal and its 
willingness to expose the mistakes and form new Olympic leadership. 
The IOC should do the same, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They must tell all, they must expel the offenders, they must  
change the bid process and return the Olympics to its place as a 
force of human ennoblement,'' Leavitt said.

<HEADLINE> Banks Post Mixed Results in Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Some of the nation's largest banks reported  
mixed results for the fourth quarter of 1998. Lower interest rates 
spurred rising fees for new home loans and refinancings, but there 
were some problems with bad loans. 
</P>
<P>
	BankAmerica, Bank One and Wells Fargo all merged with other  
banks in 1998, complicating the earnings released Tuesday with 
charges to cover the costs of layoffs, severance and branch 
closings. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got a lot of restructuring charges, so there's a lot of  
noise in the quarter, but underlying it, there's pretty good growth 
almost universally,'' said Nancy A. Bush, an analyst with Ryan, 
Beck &AMP; Co. in New Jersey. Overall, the industry's results have been 
``much better than anybody anticipated,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But most bank stocks fell Tuesday as some investors, worried  
about Brazil's shaky position, decided to cash out and take 
advantage of last week's run-up in price. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are concerns we are headed into another period of  
disturbed capital markets,'' Bush said. ``There doesn't seem to be 
a lot of confidence that while there seems to be stabilization, 
that it's going to stay stable for long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Chase Manhattan Bank, which had the strongest results,  
rose almost 5 percent Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, but 
declines of 1 percent or more were being recorded by the other big 
banks reporting results. 
</P>
<P>
	Chase closed up $3.50 at $74.37 1/2 a share. BankAmerica fell 56 1/4  
cents to $64, Bank One dropped $1 to $54.12 1/2, Wells Fargo fell 68 3/4 
cents to $36.81 3/4 and J.P. Morgan declined $2.81 1/4 to $105.93 3/4. 

</P>
<P>
 *BankAmerica Corp.    	
</P>
<P>
	The nation's second-largest bank reported a profit of $1.60  
billion, or 91 cents a diluted share, for the quarter, excluding 
the cost of the company's merger with NationsBank last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	While in line with Wall Street's expectations, BankAmerica's  
profits fell 5 percent from $1.68 billion, or 94 cents a diluted 
share, a year earlier, which excludes a charge related to 
NationsBank's merger with Barnett Banks. The figures for final 
quarter of 1997 were adjusted as if all three banks were combined 
then. 
</P>
<P>
	BankAmerica's investment in D.E. Shaw continued to drag down the  
bank's performance. 
</P>
<P>
	BankAmerica took a $43 million in trading loss in the fourth  
quarter and wrote down its investment in Shaw by $158 million. That 
reduced the bank's profit before taxes by $201 million, or 7 cents 
a share. 
</P>
<P>
	In the final quarter of 1998, BankAmerica also took a $441  
million after-tax charge to cover the cost of its merger with 
NationsBank. Including the charge, fourth quarter profits were 
$1.16 billion, or 66 cents a diluted share. 
</P>
<P>
	In the fourth quarter of 1997, the banks recorded a $220 million  
charge for the merger with Barnett Banks. Including that charge, 
the bank earned $1.46 billion, or 81 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, BankAmerica, which is based in Charlotte, N.C.,  
posted net earnings of $5.17 billion, or $2.90 a diluted share, 
compared with $6.54 billion, or $3.61 a share, in 1997. 

</P>
<P>
 *Chase Manhattan Corp.    	
</P>
<P>
	The No. 3 bank, based in New York, reported net income of $1.15  
billion, or $1.31 a share, topping analysts' expectations of $1.19 
a share. Chases' results compare with $850 million, or 94 cents a 
share, in the final quarter of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Loan loss provisions in the fourth quarter rose to $701 million  
from $468 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	For the full year, earnings were $4.02 billion, or $4.51 a  
share, compared with $3.85 billion, or $4.17 a share in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Loan loss provisions for the year were $2.7 billion, up from  
$1.8 billion in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Overdue loans totaled $1.61 billion at the end of December, up  
from $1.02 billion at the end of 1997. 

</P>
<P>
 *J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co.    	
</P>
<P>
	The No. 4 bank, based in New York, reported operating earnings  
of $175 million, or 86 cents a share, excluding an after-tax charge 
of $86 million to cover the cost of laying off about 800 people and 
consolidating its European offices. 
</P>
<P>
	J.P. Morgan's results were more than double analysts'  
expectations of 38 cents a share, but down 35 percent from a year 
earlier, when it earned $271 million, or $1.33 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Including the charge, net income in the final quarter of 1998  
was $89 million, or 42 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, J.P. Morgan had net earnings of $963 million,  
or $4.71 a share, compared with $1.47 billion, or $7.17 a share, in 
1997. 

</P>
<P>
 *Bank One Corp.    	
</P>
<P>
	The No. 5 bank, based in Chicago, turned a fourth-quarter profit  
of $1.04 billion, or 88 cents a diluted share, excluding a $1.16 
billion charge from its merger with First Chicago NBD Corp. The 
results matched analysts' average estimates, and compare with $890 
million, or 75 cents a share, in the final quarter of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Including the one-time charges, Bank One earned $226 million, or  
19 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Net earnings for all of 1998 were $3.12 billion, or $2.61 a  
share, compared with $2.96 billion, or $2.43 a share in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	It acknowledged credit losses of $951 million in the 1998 fourth  
quarter, compared with $970 million a year earlier and $943 million 
in the third quarter of 1998. 

</P>
<P>
 *Wells Fargo &AMP; Co.    	
</P>
<P>
	The No. 7 bank, based in San Francisco, reported fourth-quarter  
profits of $768 million, or 46 cents a share, excluding a $1.2 
billion charge for its merger with Norwest Corp. in November, and a 
$300 million charge for losses in Puerto Rico at Norwest's consumer 
finance unit. 
</P>
<P>
	The results, which were in line with analysts' expectations,  
compare with net income of $650 million, or 39 cents a share, for 
the fourth quarter of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Including the one-time charges, Wells Fargo posted a quarterly  
net loss of $194 million, or 12 cents a diluted share. 
</P>
<P>
	Including unusual charges, Wells Fargo earned $1.95 billion, or  
$1.17 a share, in 1998, down from $2.50 billion, or $1.48 a share, 
in 1997.

<HEADLINE> CBS Rides 2 `60 Minutes' to Top / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS's reproduction of its ``60 Minutes''  
stopwatch is among several new things that are working for networks 
during television's second season. 
</P>
<P>
	The debut of ``60 Minutes II'' made it the second straight week  
that a new show was in the Nielsen Media Research top 10. The 
newsmagazine teamed with its more famous father to help CBS beat 
NBC for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	``60 Minutes II'' was the most-watched program last Wednesday  
night, drawing the highest ratings of any regularly scheduled CBS 
program in its time slot since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's drama ``Providence'' didn't quite match the ratings of its  
highly-rated premiere. But it still finished tied for 12th in the 
week's rankings and was the top-rated show on any network last 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The new animated Fox comedy, ``The PJ's,'' isn't quite in that  
lofty company and was sharply criticized for its depiction of 
blacks this week by filmmaker Spike Lee. But Fox could be heartened 
that ``The PJ's'' drew more viewers than the show that immediately 
preceded it, ``King of the Hill'' on Tuesday's schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong showings by some of January's new programs are a  
marked contrast to the fall season, when none of network TV's new 
shows established themselves as hits. 
</P>
<P>
	Season ratings leader CBS had a 10.4 rating and 17 share last  
week, Nielsen said Tuesday. NBC had a 9.1 rating and 15 share, ABC 
had a 7.6 rating and 12 share and Fox was at 6.9 and 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the developing networks, the WB had a 3.4 rating and 5  
share, nearly double UPN's 1.8 rating and 3 share. Pax TV had a 0.8 
rating and 1 share. 
</P>
<P>
	The original ``60 Minutes'' was the week's most popular  
entertainment or news show, benefiting from the big audience that 
watched the National Football League conference championship game 
immediately preceding it. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC had alarmingly low ratings for some of its comedies,  
including the once-strong ``Mad About You.'' ``Working'' snuck back 
onto the NBC schedule only to be the lowest-rated series entry 
among any show broadcast by NBC, CBS, ABC or Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Nightly News'' won the evening news competition for the  
10th straight week. Its 9.2 rating and 17 share narrowly beat ABC's 
``World News Tonight,'' which had a 9.1 rating and 17 share. The 
``CBS Evening News'' had an 8.2 rating and 15 share. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. Share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of Jan. 11-17, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were: ``AFC Championship Post-Game Show,'' CBS, 19.6; ``60 
Minutes,'' CBS, 17.6; ``Friends,'' NBC, 15.6; ``ER,'' NBC, 14.8; 
``Frasier,'' NBC, 14.3; ``Jesse,'' NBC, 13.8; ``Touched By an 
Angel,'' CBS, 12.8; ``60 Minutes II,'' CBS, 12.3; ``Law and 
Order,'' NBC, 11.7; ``NYPD Blue,'' ABC, 11.7.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From Impeachment Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from President Clinton's defense presentation before  
the Senate, as transcribed by the Federal Document Clearing House: 

</P>
<P>
	``William Jefferson Clinton is not guilty of the charges that  
have been preferred against him. He did not commit perjury. He did 
not obstruct justice. He must not be removed from office. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, merely to say those words brings into sharp relief the  
fact that I and my colleagues are here today, in this great 
chamber, defending the president of the United States. For only the 
second time in our nation's history, the Senate is convened to try 
the president of the United States on articles of impeachment. 
There is no one who does not feel the weight of this moment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nonetheless, our role as lawyers, as much as it would be in  
any other forum. We will not be able to match the eloquence of the 
13 managers who spoke to you last week. We will try, however, to 
respond to the charges levied against the president as directly and 
candidly as possible and to present his defense as clearly and as 
cogently as we are able. 
</P>
<P>
	``We seek on his behalf no more than we know you will give us --  
a fair opportunity to be heard, a fair assessment of the facts and 
the law, and a fair judgment.'' -- Charles F.C. Ruff, White House 
counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``We will defend the president on the facts and on the law and  
on the constitutional principles that must guide your 
deliberations. Some have suggested that we fear to do so. We do 
not.'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``And at the end of our presentation, we will have demonstrated  
beyond any doubt that there is no basis on which the Senate can or 
should convict the president of any of the charges brought against 
him.'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The principal focus of the discovery being conducted by the  
Jones lawyers during this period was not on the merits of their 
client's case. They devoted most of their time and their energy to 
attempts to pry into the personal life of the president. Mr. 
Bennett, the president's counsel, objected to those efforts on the 
ground that they had no relevance in Ms. Jones' claims, and were 
intended to do nothing other than advance the agendas of those who 
were supporting Ms. Jones' lawsuit.'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``On April 1, 1998, Judge Wright granted summary judgment in  
favor of President Clinton, dismissing the Jones suit in its 
entirety. 
</P>
<P>
	``She ruled that no evidence that Ms. Jones had offered or that  
her lawyers had discovered made out any viable claim of sexual 
harassment or intentional infliction of emotion distress. 
</P>
<P>
	``Importantly, Judge Wright ruled that evidence of any pattern  
or practice of comparable conduct by the president was not 
important to the case.'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``In mid-January 1998, Linda Tripp has brought the independent  
counsel information that she had been gathering surreptitiously for 
months about Ms. Lewinsky's relationship with the president and her 
involvement in the Jones case, and thus began the penultimate 
chapter. 
</P>
<P>
	``As you will see, Ms. Tripp's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky  
and her role in these matters is more than merely a backdrop to the 
succeeding events.'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``On ... (Jan.) 16, (1998) Ms. Tripp invited Ms. Lewinsky to  
have lunch with her in the Pentagon City mall, and there she was 
greeted by a corps of FBI agents and independent counsel lawyers 
and taken to a hotel room where she spent the next several hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ms. Tripp was in the room next door for much of that time.  
When she left that evening, she went home to meet with the Jones 
lawyers with whom we know she has been in contact for many months, 
in order to brief them about her knowledge of the relationship 
between Ms. Lewinsky and the president, so that they in turn could 
question the president the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
	As the independent counsel himself has acknowledged, Ms. Tripp  
was able to play this oddly multifaceted role because, although as 
part of her immunity agreement the OIC could have prevented her 
from talking about Ms. Lewinsky, they inexplicably chose not to.'' 
-- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The (House Judiciary) committee called no fact witnesses.  
</P>
<P>
	``Despite numerous efforts to extract from the committee some  
description of the specific charges against which the president 
would have to defend himself, it was not until approximately 4:30 
on Dec. 9, as I was completing my testimony before the committee, 
that any such notice was provided. 
</P>
<P>
	``And then it came in the form of four draft articles of  
impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Three days later, the committee reported out those articles.''  
-- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``And so we are here. But before moving on, let me pause on an  
important procedural point. Although the Senate has asked that the 
parties address the issue of witnesses only after these 
presentations have been completed, the managers spent much of their 
time last week explaining to you why, if only witnesses could be 
called, you would be able to resolve all of the supposed conflicts 
in the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tell me, then, how is it that the managers can be so certain  
of the strength of their case? They didn't hear any of these 
witnesses.'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The only witness they called, the independent counsel himself,  
acknowledged that he had not even met any of the witness who 
testified before the grand jury. Yet they appeared before you to 
tell you that they are convinced of the president's guilt and that 
they are prepared to demand his removal from office.'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, the managers would have you believe that the Judiciary  
Committee and the House were really nothing more than grand jurors, 
serving as some routine screening device to sort out impeachment 
chaff from impeachment wheat. Thus, as they would have it, there 
was no need for anything more than a review of the cold record 
prepared by the independent counsel.'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``You have before you all that you need to reach this  
conclusion: There was no basis for the House to impeach, and there 
is now and never will be any basis for the Senate to convict.'' -- 
Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, the managers have not shown and could not on this record  
or any record prove that the president committed any of the 
offenses charged in the articles. But even if they could, these 
offenses would not warrant you deciding to remove the president 
from office. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this regard, an impeachment trial is unlike any other. You  
are the judges of the law and the facts and the appropriate 
sanction. Before casting a vote of guilty or not guilty, you must 
decide not only whether the president committed the acts with which 
he is charged, but whether those acts so seriously undermine the 
integrity of our governmental structure that he must be removed 
from office.'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Far be it from me or indeed anyone else to instruct this body  
on its constitutional role.'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The president may be removed from office only upon impeachment  
for and conviction of treason, bribery, or other high crimes and 
misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The offenses charged here, even if supported by the evidence,  
do not meet that lofty standard. A standard that the framers 
intentionally set at this extraordinarily high level to ensure that 
only the most serious offenses -- and in particular, those that 
subverted our system of government would justify overturning a 
popular election.'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Impeachment is not a remedy for private wrongs; it's a method  
of removing someone whose continued presence in office would cause 
grave danger to the nation.'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Absent the element of danger to the state, we believe the  
delegates to the federal convention of 1787 in providing that the 
president should serve for a fixed elective term, rather than 
during good behavior or popularity, struck the balance in favor of 
stability in the executive branch.'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``To argue then, as the managers do, that the phrase ``other  
crimes and misdemeanors'' was really meant to encompass a wide 
range of offenses that one might find in a compendium of English 
criminal law simply flies in the face of the clear intent of the 
framers, who carefully chose their language and knew exactly what 
those words meant and knew exactly what risks they intended to 
protect against.'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, the managers have made fun of the notion that hundreds of  
distinguished scholars and historians expressed their opinion that 
the offenses with which the president has been charged are not high 
crimes or misdemeanors. Indeed, they suggested, not too subtly, 
that they must have signed those letters because they were 
political supporters of the president. ... Is it possible instead 
that distinguished scholars of all political persuasions thought it 
important to offer their professional opinion on a matter of the 
greatest historical and legal import because they cared about our 
country? Because they cared that the constitutional process not be 
debased?'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps if the majority members of the full Judiciary  
Committee had paused for even a moment to consider these issues; if 
they'd taken even a few hours to debate the question of what 
constitutional standard should apply, one might now give greater 
credence to the belated constitutional exposition that they have 
offered here. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, perhaps the majority was convinced by their own  
rhetoric; by the oft-repeated mantra that impeachment is merely a 
preliminary step in the process, and that the House need not be 
concerned with its weighty constitutional duty, and saw little 
reason to explore the constitutional underpinnings of that duty.'' 
-- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Our Senate must ask here whether the conduct charged against  
President Clinton would in its nature be inconsistent with the 
decision to allow him to continue to perform the duties of his 
office, just as you would ask, if you had a judge before you or 
another civil officer before you, whether the charges are similarly 
inconsistent with the notion that he or she should be allowed to 
continue to perform those duties.'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether weighing the constitutional and governmental  
implications of removal or asking whether the accused can be 
expected to perform his duties, the Senate has always recognized 
that the test will be different depending on the office that the 
accused holds.'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``As I told the Judiciary Committee on Dec. 9 when I testified  
before them, not all serious misconduct flowing from one of the 
president's official roles is impeachable. Neither is all serious 
misconduct flowing from his personal conduct immune from 
impeachment. Judgments must be made, and they must be based on the 
core principles that inform the framers' decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The managers would, in effect, ask you to eschew making these  
judgments.'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``They speak of perjury and obstruction of justice in general  
terms, and they argue that they are offenses inimical to the system 
of justice. No one here would dispute that simplistic proposition. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the managers will not walk with you down the difficult  
path. They will not speak of facts, of differing circumstances, and 
differing societal interests. They will not because they do not 
appear to recognize that those questions must be asked.'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Perjury about some official act may indeed be a  
constitutionally acceptable basis for impeachment. Perjury about a 
purely private matter should at the very least lead this body to 
question whether no matter how seriously we take the person's 
violation, for example, of the witness' oath, the drastic remedy of 
removal from office is the proper response.'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The principle that guides your deliberations, I suggest, must  
not only be faithful to the intent of the framers, it must be 
consistent with the governmental structure that they gave us and 
the delicate relationship between the legislative branch and the 
executive branch that is the hallmark of that structure.'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``We submit to you that given the gravity of the decision you  
must reach, each of you should go further and ask whether the House 
has established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, lawyers and laymen too often, I think, treat the standard  
of proof as meaningless legal jargon with no real application to 
the world of difficult decisions, but I suggest to you that it is 
much more than that. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the guidepost that shows you the way through the  
labyrinth of conflicting evidence. It tells you to look within 
yourself and ask: Would I make the most important decisions of my 
life based on the level of certainty I have about these facts?'' -- 
Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``You have been asked to take this action in circumstances where  
even taking the darkest view of the managers' position, there is no 
suggestion of corruption or misuse of office or any other conduct 
that places our system of government at risk in the two remaining 
years of this president's term, when once again the people will get 
the chance to decide who should lead them.'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``There is not a court anywhere, from highest to lowest, would  
hesitate if they were confronted with an indictment written like 
these articles, to throw it out.'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``They have, in essence, treated these articles as empty vessels  
to be filled with some witches' brew of charges considered, charges 
considered and abandoned, and charges never considered at all.'' -- 
Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``In particular, each charges multiple offenses and is therefore  
void -- in the criminal-justice vernacular -- for duplicity, because 
in a criminal case and here as well, lumping multiple offenses 
together in one charging document creates a risk that a verdict may 
be based, not on a unanimous finding of guilt, as to any particular 
charge, but instead, may be composed with multiple individual 
judgments, and that risk is in direct violation of the requirement 
of the Constitution that this body agree by a two-thirds majority 
before the president may be removed.'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
		   ------	 
</P>
<P>
	``As we have noted, both articles are framed in the broadest  
generalities and composed of multiple different offenses. Nothing 
contained in the Judiciary Committee's majority report or in the 
trial brief or in the presentation of the managers can cure the 
constitutional infirmity that affect -- infects these articles.'' -- 
Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I want you to have in mind throughout our presentation, and  
indeed throughout the rest of these proceedings, this one 
principle: be wary, be wary, of the prosecutor who feels it 
necessary to deceive the court.'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The mere fact that the recollections of two witnesses may  
differ does not mean that one is committing perjury. Common sense 
and the stringent requirements of the law dictate that more is 
required.'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Any assessment of that testimony must begin with one immutable  
fact: He admitted that he had, in his words, inappropriate, 
intimate contact with Monica Lewinsky. No one who was present for 
that testimony, has read the transcript, or watched the video tape, 
could come away believing anything other than that the president 
and Ms. Lewinsky engaged in sexual conduct.'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The managers in their eagerness to find misconduct where none  
had found it before have searched every nook and cranny of the 
grand jury transcript and sent forward to you a shopping list of 
alleged misstatements, obviously in the hope that among them you 
will find one with which you disagree. But they hope in vain. 
</P>
<P>
	The record simply will not support a finding that the president  
perjured himself before the grand jury.'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not here to talk to you today about the president's  
testimony in the Jones deposition. We do seek to convince you that 
before the grand jury, the president was open, candid, truthful.'' 
-- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Common sense also is enough to tell you that there cannot be  
any basis for charging a witness with perjury on the ground that 
you disbelieve his testimony about his own subjective belief in a 
definition of a term used in a civil deposition. Not only is there 
no evidence to support such a charge here, it is difficult to 
contemplate what evidence the managers might hope to rely on to 
meet that burden.'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The managers, as was true of the majority report and the  
independent counsel referral before that, build their theory in 
this case not on any pillars of obstruction, but on shifting sand 
castles of speculation.'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``In truth, the only reasonable explanation for these events is  
the one the president gave to the grand jury. He was simply not 
concerned about gifts. He gave a lot, he got a lot. And he saw no 
need to engage in any effort to conceal them. 
</P>
<P>
	The president did not urge Ms. Lewinsky to conceal the gifts he  
had given her, and of course, he did not lie to the grand jury 
about that subject.'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Article II alleges that the president obstructed justice by  
denying to his closest aides that he had a sexual relationship with 
Monica Lewinsky, the very same denial he made to his family and his 
friends and the American people. 
</P>
<P>
	These allegedly impeachable denials took place in the immediate  
aftermath of the public revelation of the Lewinsky matter, at the 
very time that the president was denying that relationship to the 
entire country on national television. 
</P>
<P>
	Having made the announcement to the whole country, it is simply  
absurd, I suggest to you, to believe that he was somehow attempting 
corruptly to influence the senior staff when he told them virtually 
the same thing, at the same time.'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Under the theory proffered by the managers, in essence every  
person who heard the president's denial could have been called to 
the grand jury in order to create still an additional charge of 
obstruction of justice.'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The managers have constructed out of sealing wax and string  
and spiders' webs, a theory that would ... lend to a series of 
otherwise innocuous and indeed exculpatory events of dark and 
sinister cast.'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not here to defend William Clinton, the man. He, like  
all of us, will find his judges elsewhere. We are here to defend 
William Clinton, the president of the United States, for whom you 
are the only judges. 
</P>
<P>
	You are free to criticize him, to find his personal conduct  
distasteful, but ask whether this is the moment when, for the first 
time in our history, the actions of a president have so put at risk 
the government the framers created that there is only one solution. 
</P>
<P>
	You must find not merely that removal is an acceptable option,  
that we will be OK the day after you vote. You must find that it's 
the only solution, that our democracy should not be made to sustain 
two more years of this president's service.'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing that our form of government cannot abide is the  
notion that impeachment is merely one more weapon the Congress can 
use in the contest between the legislative and executive 
branches.'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Suppose that you find that the president committed one or more  
of the offenses that the managers have charged. Then there remains 
only one issue before you. Whatever your feelings may be about 
William Clinton the man, or William Clinton the political ally or 
opponent, or William Clinton the father and the husband, ask only 
this: should William Clinton the president be removed from office? 
Are we at that horrific moment in our history when our union can be 
preserved only by taking the step that the framers saw as a last 
resort?'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm never certain how to respond when an advocate on the other  
side of a case calls up images of patriots over the centuries who 
have sacrificed themselves to preserve our democracy. I have no 
personal experience with war. I've only visited Normandy as a 
tourist. 
</P>
<P>
	But I do know this: My father was on Omaha Beach 55 years ago.  
If you want to know how he would feel if he were here today, he 
wouldn't fight -- no one fought for one side of this case or the 
other. He fought as all those did for our country and our 
Constitution. And as long as each of us -- manager, president's 
counsel, senator -- does his or her constitutional duty, those who 
fought for their country will be proud.'' -- Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``We, the people of the United States, have formed a more  
perfect union. We formed it; we nurtured it; we've seen it grow. We 
have not been perfect. And perhaps the most extraordinary thing 
about our Constitution that it thrives despite our human 
imperfections. 
</P>
<P>
	When the American people hear the president talk to Congress  
tonight, they will know the answer to the question: Neighbor, how 
stands the union? It stands strong, vibrant, free. 
</P>
<P>
	And I close as I opened two hours ago -- two and a half hours ago  
-- William Jefferson Clinton is not guilty of the charges that have 
been brought against him. He didn't commit perjury. He didn't 
obstruct justice. He must not be removed from office.'' -- Ruff.

<HEADLINE> Tigers Sign Florie, Four Others </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The Detroit Tigers avoided salary arbitration by  
agreeing Tuesday to a $1.3 million, one-year contract with pitcher 
Bryce Florie. 
</P>
<P>
	Florie, a right-hander, was 8-9 with a 4.80 ERA last season and  
made $600,000. He started a career-high 16 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Center fielder Brian Hunter, the only Tiger remaining in  
arbitration, asked for $2.75 million and was offered $1.75 million. 
The Detroit News reported Tuesday that the Tigers had offered 
Hunter a two-year contract worth more than $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Tuesday, Detroit agreed to one-year contract with  
pitchers Dave Borkowski, Will Brunson, Francisco Cordero and Matt 
Drews. 
</P>
<P>
	Borkowski pitched last season for Double-A Jacksonville, where  
he led the Southern League with 16 wins. He went 16-7 with a 4.63 
ERA in 28 starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Brunson, signed off waivers from the Los Angeles Dodgers on  
Sept. 6, appeared in eight games with the Tigers last season. He 
allowed no runs in three innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordero was sidelined for much of 1998 with a stress fracture of  
his right elbow. He pitched for Jacksonville and for Class-A 
Lakeland, where he was 1-1 with eight saves and a 4.86 ERA. Drews 
was 5-17 with a 6.57 ERA for Triple-A Toledo.

<HEADLINE> Tennis' Graf Reconciles With Father </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMBURG, Germany (AP) -- Steffi Graf has reconciled with her  
father, and he plans to watch her play at the Australian Open, 
Stern magazine reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Graf was released from prison nine months ago after being  
convicted on tax evasion charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf managed his daughter's career during her rise to the No. 1  
ranking and he handled her earnings from her 20 Grand Slam titles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only complaint I have after all this was the lack of  
communication,'' Stern quoted Steffi Graf as saying. ``All he had 
to say was `I can't keep up with it anymore.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Steffi Graf has since hired a professional manager, and her  
father won't be taking over his old job, Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Graf, 59, was sentenced in January 1997 to three years,  
nine months for evading taxes on $6.55 million of his daughter's 
tennis earnings. He was released in April 1998 after serving more 
than half the sentence, counting pretrial custody. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time he was at one his daughter's tournaments was at  
Wimbledon, shortly before he was arrested on Aug. 2, 1995. The 
Australian Open began Monday, and his daughter is seeded 10th.

<HEADLINE> Marine's Comment Sparks Controversy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP PENDLETON, Calif. (AP) -- Staff Sgt. Paul Rinnander thought  
he was making an offhand comment to a Marine base newspaper. But 
his few choice words landed him in trouble and sparked a nationwide 
debate over free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Rinnander, an 11-year veteran with a flawless record, was asked  
by a reporter for the Scout newspaper's ``Marine on the street'' 
column whether anything bugged him about the corps. 
</P>
<P>
	``Recruit discipline,'' answered Rinnander, 29. ``There is a  
total lack of discipline and respect shown by Marines coming out of 
basic training.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately for Rinnander, Sgt. Maj. Lewis G. Lee -- the corps'  
senior enlisted man -- was visiting Camp Pendleton when the comment 
was published in October. Soon Rinnander was ordered to report to 
Parris Island, S.C., to become a drill instructor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't say it wasn't retaliation. He shot his mouth off  
and now he's going to be a (drill instructor) in 2000,'' Lee said 
Tuesday from his Pentagon office. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did that boy a favor,'' Lee said. ``He said the Marine Corps  
should do a better job. Now he's got a chance to prove he can 
help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lee, 48, sent Rinnander a blistering e-mail, expressing  
``regret'' that they didn't get to discuss the matter in person: 
``It would have been an unforgettable meeting for you. ... Don't 
respond to my e-mail, you'll only (expletive) me off more at you 
than I already am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rinnander was stunned. His children, ages 5 and 9, live with his  
ex-wife in San Diego and he wanted to be a San Diego recruit depot 
instructor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in the Marine Corps to help defend and protect the  
Constitution, and I thought that meant freedom of speech,'' he 
said. ``Now it looks like I'm being punished for speaking what I 
think is the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The confrontation has generated mounds of letters to the  
national Marine Corps Times. Opinions are about split.

<HEADLINE> Court Rejects Long-Distance Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today refused to make it  
easier for the nation's biggest local phone companies to break into 
the $90 billion long-distance market. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, without comment, rejected appeals in which three of  
the five regional Bell telephone companies challenged the special 
hurdles Congress placed in the way of their offering long-distance 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC Communications, US West and Bell Atlantic said the special  
requirements they must meet, spelled out in the Telecommunications 
Act of 1996, are discriminatory and single them out for punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Constitution bars laws that apply to an individual or a  
specific group and is punitive, and the phone companies' appeals 
said Congress subjected them to such a ``bill of attainder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The appeal filed jointly on behalf of SBC and US West contended  
that Congress never before has ``singled out named companies to 
forbid them, and them alone, from engaging in otherwise lawful 
lines of business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal appeals courts in New Orleans and the District of  
Columbia rejected that argument and upheld the disputed 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyers urged the highest court to leave  
those rulings intact, arguing that ``nothing in the challenged 
provisions can plausibly be characterized as punishment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 law requires Baby Bells to open their local phone  
markets to long-distance companies and other potential rivals 
before the Federal Communications Commission will let them sell 
their own long-distance service to local customers. 
</P>
<P>
	No Bell company has yet won such FCC approval because, the  
commission says, none has sufficiently opened its market. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, the five Baby Bells provide more than 80 percent of  
the local phone service in the United States. The other two 
regional companies are BellSouth and Ameritech. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court currently has under study, and is expected to  
decide by July, the validity of federal rules aimed at quickly 
opening the $110 billion local telephone market to competition. At 
issue in that separate dispute is whether the FCC or the states 
have the authority to set pricing rules for the new competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for SBC and US West urged the justices ``to provide the  
lower courts -- and Congress -- with needed guidance as to the rules 
governing the legislature's ability to impose burdens on a targeted 
few.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They said the challenged provisions are depriving consumers of  
as much as $300 billion in savings that would flow from a more 
competitive long-distance market. 
</P>
<P>
	Government lawyers disagreed, telling the court that the Baby  
Bells' challenge threatens ``to unravel much of the 1996 act, to 
the great detriment of American consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court five times has struck down acts of Congress as  
unconstitutional bills of attainder, most notably laws that exposed 
members or adherents of the Confederacy and Communist Party to 
punitive treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike sanctions based on someone's political affiliation,  
``business regulations based on corporate economic power and 
incentives ... rest not on a desire to 'punish' the regulated 
corporations but on a recognition of the objective dangers posed by 
monopoly power,'' government lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the phone companies' appeals were supported in  
friend-of-the-court briefs submitted by 12 states -- Arizona, 
Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Michigan, Mississippi, New Mexico, 
Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The cases are SBC Communications vs. FCC, 98-652, and Bell  
Atlantic vs. FCC, 98-653.

<HEADLINE> United States Seen in Good Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- By most measures, the state of America, if not  
necessarily the state of the union, is terrific. Crime is down, the 
economy is up, gasoline is cheap and jobs are plentiful. 
</P>
<P>
	And the impeachment trial of the president taking credit for all  
this good news has apparently left Americans unfazed. A new poll 
shows Americans satisfied with their lot and with President Clinton 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a few hiccups last year, the stock market continues to  
defy both expectations and common sense. The Dow Jones industrial 
average hit a new high of 9,643.32 on Jan. 8, following on an 
unprecedented fourth consecutive year of double-digit percentage 
gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Unemployment was 4.3 percent last month -- the lowest monthly  
rate since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	Inflation isn't an issue. Prices for many popular consumer goods  
such as computers and home electronics keep going down. 
</P>
<P>
	Gas prices are cheaper than many young drivers have ever known.  
Practical folks who squeezed into econo-boxes a decade ago are 
happily tooling about in big, gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-year, fixed-rate home mortgages average below 7 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	Crime is at its lowest levels in decades. Every region of the  
nation and communities of all sizes shared in a 5 percent drop in 
serious crimes reported to police in the first half of 1998, the 
FBI reports. In New York City, the mayor is reduced to fretting 
about jaywalkers. 
</P>
<P>
	Welfare caseloads nationwide are down more than 40 percent from  
the high in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans haven't worried about the missile race and throw  
weight and such for a while now. Clinton's economic overtures to 
Fidel Castro's Cuba earlier this month caused barely a ripple at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps not surprisingly, the national mood is downright cheery.  
</P>
<P>
	A survey released this week by the Pew Research Center for the  
People and the Press proclaimed that 53 percent of Americans are 
satisfied with the way things are going -- up from 46 percent a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5  
percentage points, also indicates only 15 percent of people are 
watching a lot of the impeachment trial on television. Two-thirds 
of the public wants Clinton to remain in office.

<HEADLINE> Court To Decide on Internet Porn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Justice Department and the American  
Civil Liberties Union will square off before a judge Wednesday over 
a federal law requiring companies to keep Internet material 
considered ``harmful to minors'' away from children. 
</P>
<P>
	The Child Online Protection Act, the second major effort by  
Congress to protect children on the Internet, would require 
commercial Web sites to collect a credit card number or some other 
access code as proof of age before allowing Internet users to view 
online material ``harmful to minors.'' Violators could get up to 
six months in jail and a $50,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-day hearing opens before U.S. District Judge Lowell A.  
Reed. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Congress wins this, the Internet would go from being the  
most revolutionary, creative technology in history to a pretty 
tame, often meaningless means of communicating only about things 
that are fit for a 6-year-old,'' said Stefan Presser, legal 
director of the ACLU of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, Reed temporarily blocked enforcement of the law.  
Now, the judge will decide whether a preliminary injunction -- a 
more permanent delay -- should be issued. A ruling is expected by 
Feb. 1, when the restraining order expires. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say the law is a sensible way to keep Internet  
pornography away from children. Unlike the Communications Decency 
Act of 1996, which was struck down by the Supreme Court on First 
Amendment grounds, the new law applies only to commercial Web 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The law would act as a ``brown paper wrapper'' protecting  
children from pornographic and obscene material, said Donna Rice 
Hughes, a spokeswoman for Enough Is Enough, an advocacy group. Ms. 
Hughes' relationship with Colorado Sen. Gary Hart sank his 
presidential campaign in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	``Playboy and Penthouse are protected speech for adults, not  
kids,'' she said. ``We want to do the same thing in cyberspace with 
respect to the World Wide Web.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ACLU has argued that the law, signed by President Clinton in  
October, violates the First Amendment and could be used to 
prosecute gays, AIDS activists or doctors distributing 
gynecological information. 
</P>
<P>
	Others are concerned that a bill aimed mainly at pornographic  
Web sites might inadvertently snare mainstream sites, especially as 
the Internet becomes an entertainment medium that could include 
movies. 
</P>
<P>
	A friend-of-the-court brief on the ACLU's behalf has been filed  
by more than 20 organizations representing publishers, Internet 
service providers, journalists and the technology industry. The 
groups contend that filtering software and other technology do a 
far better job than any federal law ever could. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are many more effective ways of protecting children from  
inappropriate content on the Internet than this ill-conceived law 
that limits the rights of adults to free speech,'' said Jerry 
Berman of the Center for Democracy and Technology, an Internet 
policy think tank. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., the only lawmaker in that chamber to  
vote against the measure, argued that the law would not pass 
constitutional muster because it sets a national -- as opposed to 
local -- obscenity standard. The Supreme Court has never approved 
such a standard before.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Address-4 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	In the past six years, we have cut the welfare rolls nearly in  
half. Two years ago, from this podium, I asked five companies to 
lead a national effort to hire people off welfare. Tonight, our 
Welfare to Work Partnership includes 10,000 companies who have 
hired hundreds of thousands of people. Our balanced budget will 
help another 200,000 people move to the dignity and pride of work. 
</P>
<P>
	We must bring the spark of private enterprise to every community  
in America -- to inner cities and remote rural areas -- with more 
support for community development banks, empowerment zones and 
100,000 vouchers for affordable housing. And I ask Congress to 
support our bold plan to help businesses raise up to $15 billion of 
private sector capital to bring jobs and opportunity to our inner 
cities and rural areas -- with tax credits and loan guarantees, 
including new American Private Investment Companies modeled on our 
Overseas Private Investment Corporation. Our greatest untapped 
markets are not overseas -- they are right here at home. 
</P>
<P>
	We must bring prosperity back to the family farm. Dropping  
prices and the loss of foreign markets have devastated too many 
family farmers. I am ready to work with lawmakers of both parties 
to create a farm safety net including crop insurance reform and 
farm income assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	We must strengthen our lead in technology.  
</P>
<P>
	Government investment led to the creation of the Internet. I  
propose a nearly 30 percent increase in long-term computing 
research. 
</P>
<P>
	We must be ready for the 21st century from its very first  
moment, by solving the ``Y2K'' computer problem. If we work hard 
with state and local governments and businesses large and small, 
the ``Y2K problem'' can be remembered as the last headache of the 
20th century, not the first crisis of the 21st. 
</P>
<P>
	For our own prosperity, we must support economic growth abroad.  
</P>
<P>
	Until recently, one-third of our economic growth came from  
exports. But over the past year and a half, financial turmoil 
overseas has put that growth at risk. Today, much of the world is 
in recession, with Asia hit especially hard. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the most serious financial crisis in a half century. To  
meet it, the U.S. and other nations have reduced interest rates and 
strengthened the International Monetary Fund. While the turmoil is 
not over, we are working with other industrial nations to contain 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, we will continue to work on a global basis to  
build a financial system for the 21st century that promotes 
prosperity and tames the cycles of boom and bust. This June I will 
meet with other world leaders to advance this historic purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	We must also create a freer and fairer trading system for the  
21st century. Trade has divided Americans for too long. We must 
find the common ground on which business, workers, 
environmentalists, farmers and government can stand together. 
</P>
<P>
	We must tear down barriers, open markets, and expand trade. At  
the same time, we must ensure that ordinary citizens in all 
countries benefit from trade -- trade that promotes the dignity of 
work, the rights of workers, the protection of the environment. And 
we must insist that international trade organizations be open to 
public scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	We must enforce our trade laws when imports unlawfully flood our  
nation. I have already informed the government of Japan that if 
that nation's sudden surge of steel imports into our country is not 
reversed, America will respond. 
</P>
<P>
	And we must act to help all American manufacturers hit hard by  
the present crisis -- with loan guarantees and other incentives to 
increase U.S. exports by nearly $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	We can achieve a new consensus on trade, based on these  
principles. I ask Congress to join me in this common approach and 
give the president the trade authority long used to advance our 
prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, we should expand trade with our neighbors in Central  
America and the Caribbean. And because trade and investment are the 
keys to African development -- we must finally pass the African 
Growth and Opportunity Act. 
</P>
<P>
	And tonight, I also issue a call to the nations of the world to  
join the United States in a new round of global negotiations to 
expand exports of services, of manufactures, and most of all, farm 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	We will work with the International Labor Organization on a new  
initiative to lift up labor standards around the world. And this 
year, we will lead the international community to conclude a treaty 
to ban abusive child labor everywhere in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	If we do these things -- invest in our people, our communities,  
and our technology, and lead in the global economy -- then we will 
begin to meet the historic responsibility of our generation to 
build a 21st century prosperity for America. 
</P>
<P>
	A Strong America in a New World  
</P>
<P>
	No nation in history has had the opportunity and the  
responsibility we now have to shape a world more peaceful, secure 
and free. 
</P>
<P>
	All Americans can be proud that our leadership helped to bring  
peace in Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	All Americans can be proud that our leadership has put Bosnia on  
the path to peace. And with our NATO allies, we are pressing the 
Serbian government to stop its brutal repression in Kosovo, to 
bring those responsible to justice, and give the people of Kosovo 
the self-government they deserve.

<HEADLINE> Md. Mortgage Co. Disputes Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, Md. (AP) -- A mortgage company is disputing an  
announcement by the Clinton administration that it has agreed to a 
$6.5 billion settlement of discrimination accusations. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of Columbia National Inc. denied that the company, the  
Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Fort Worth 
Human Relations Commission reached a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Executive Officer Dave Gallitano said the only agreement  
with HUD is to continue the company's mission to bring home 
mortgage loans to low-to-moderate income families. 
</P>
<P>
	``The statements released by the White House and HUD are  
inaccurate and very misleading,'' Gallitano said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia National was accused of violating the Fair Housing Act  
by making too few loans to minority or low-to-moderate income 
families. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton announced the settlement Monday in a tribute  
to Martin Luther King Jr., saying the Columbia, Md.-based lender 
agreed to make $6 billion in home mortgage loans available over 
five years to minorities and low- to moderate-income families in 28 
states. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also will spend $529 million on programs designed to  
increase home ownership among minority and poor families, the 
president said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Columbia National said the $6.5 billion figure actually  
represent the ``volume of loans we made over the past five years.'' 
It said it was told HUD had made no finding of discrimination.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Stocks Up Despite Rate Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- Brazilian stocks were higher today  
despite a spike in interbank lending rates to 32 percent following 
the government announcement that it would float its currency on a 
long-term basis. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank raised its overnight interbank lending rate  
from 29.80 percent in what some analysts said was a bid to 
discourage inflation and an outflow of investment from Latin 
America's largest economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices on the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange slipped early on  
the news but later were up 3.9 percent. The rise followed gains on 
Friday and Monday in the wake of the government's decision to stop 
spending hard currency to shore up its overvalued currency, the 
real. 
</P>
<P>
	The real weakened today, trading at 1.60 to the dollar compared  
to Monday's close of 1.59 percent. The currency has tumbled 24 
percent since the government began a series of steps to devalue it. 
</P>
<P>
	The government now must take the painful measures of cutting its  
swollen budget deficit and raising taxes if it is to preserve 
investor confidence and win additional foreign financial aid -- two 
elements seen as crucial in the effort to save Brazil's economy. 
</P>
<P>
	To do so, however, the government must push reforms through an  
independent-minded and often cantankerous Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brazil has already won,'' declared President Fernando Henrique  
Cardoso, speaking at a news conference with the leaders of both 
houses of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet many analysts think it too early to claim victory.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think that Brazil has still got to do a lot of homework on  
the fiscal front,'' said Mauro Schneider, chief economist at ING 
Barings in Sao Paulo. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States fears that if Brazil suffers an Asian-style  
currency crisis, its economy could hurt other countries in the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
	Nose-diving currencies and a loss of investor confidence could  
cause a regional economic contraction, which in turn would affect 
U.S. exports and hurt the U.S. economy, which has about 2,000 
American multinationals doing business in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's finance minister, Pedro Malan -- eager to win another  
installment of a $41 billion emergency loan package -- was in 
Washington to explain to the Clinton administration, the 
International Monetary Fund and investors how his government will 
make its promised reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardoso, meanwhile, defended his government's move to end once  
and for all its expensive four-year defense of the real's value, 
saying the shift to a floating currency was a necessary first step 
to turning around the economy in this nation of 165 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	Global stock markets rallied after Brazil permanently floated  
its currency and sought to assure the rest of the world that it 
will drive ahead with further tough reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil has received around $9 billion of the IMF-led rescue  
package and is now seeking the release of another $9 billion 
installment. 
</P>
<P>
	But the IMF is requiring that Cardoso's government first raise  
taxes and cut spending to reduce its public deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	This, however, is meeting vocal opposition from state governors  
who claim they lack the means to pay their multibillion-dollar 
debts to the federal government.

<HEADLINE> GOP Tempers Clinton Criticisms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans accused President Clinton of  
proposing too much spending and too few tax cuts but generally held 
their fire on a State of the Union address framed against the 
partisan divisions of the impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats stood by their president, but some liberals expressed  
concerns about new defense spending and a prosperous nation's 
inattention to the plight of the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, studiously polite during past Clinton State of the  
Union speeches, were noticeably more distant this year, mostly 
keeping their applause short and unenthusiastic. Two House leaders 
who have been strong critics of Clinton, Majority Leader Dick 
Armey, R-Texas, and Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, sat stiffly in their 
seats and did not clap. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an opportunity, the Congress and the White House,  
working together, ... to have an agenda that we can advance that 
the American people will really approve of,'' said Senate Majority 
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., sounding the theme that the trial need 
not impede cooperation in passing legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The political paradox,'' said House Banking Committee Chairman  
Jim Leach, R-Iowa, ``is that the president's personal problems with 
Congress are likely to cause a redoubled effort at both ends of 
Pennsylvania Avenue to develop a constructive legislative 
relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., attending his first State of the  
Union as House speaker, said Clinton ``gave another good speech 
under difficult circumstances.'' But he said the president fell 
short in not proposing a comprehensive tax cut, not devoting enough 
attention to national security and not shifting more education 
programs to local control. 
</P>
<P>
	House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas,  
stressed that Republicans, who are seeking a 10 percent 
across-the-board tax rate cut, were dissatisfied with Clinton's 
plans to spend more and offer only limited tax cuts. ``Instead of 
using the surplus to retire the debt or return it to the American 
people through lower taxes, the president is proposing to spend it 
all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri said Clinton's  
speech, in which he introduced a far-reaching plan to protect 
Social Security and urged spending in numerous other programs in 
child care, education and crime-fighting, was his most vigorous 
since his first address to Congress six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has put forward an historic and aggressive set of  
initiatives, taking a giant leap towards addressing Americans' 
concerns as we approach a new century,'' Gephardt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Martin Frost of Texas, chairman of the House Democratic  
Caucus, said the president, with his ``bold agenda,'' ``did the 
country and the Congress a service tonight by moving our focus away 
from partisan politics and personal attacks and toward common-sense 
proposals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the liberal wing of the party also expressed concerns about  
some aspects of the agenda. Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., questioned 
Clinton's plan to spend more on defense, saying: ``We are locked 
into a perpetual arms race with ourselves'' that deprives social 
programs of needed funding. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Earl Hilliard, D-Ala., stressed that amid all the talk of  
prosperity, ``the people living on the streets of America and 
huddling in the shelters of our cities are our neighbors and our 
fellow citizens, and we must end their poverty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several lawmakers stayed away from the speech to protest  
Clinton's appearance before Congress at the same time the Senate is 
weighing his future in office. ``It's incredibly inappropriate for 
the House to actually offer the invitation. Didn't we just impeach 
the guy?'' asked Republican freshman Rep. Tom Tancredo of Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Others said the Lewinsky scandal would inevitably affect  
Clinton's ability to carry through on his goals. Sen. Dick Lugar, 
R-Ind., predicted bipartisan efforts in such areas as Social 
Security, health care, education and law enforcement, but said 
``progress this year may depend largely on working around corrosive 
effects of the White House predicament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Steve Largent, R-Okla., who joined Rep. Jennifer Dunn,  
R-Wash., in delivering the official Republican response to the 
speech, spoke of the need for reconciliation in national divisions 
that affect racial and family relationships as well as the 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reconciliation requires the humility and courage to say 'I am  
sorry, I was wrong will you forgive me?' Therein lies the healing 
salve for the wounded soul of our nation,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Pluto May Lose Planet Designation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M.(AP) -- Pluto's days as one of our solar  
system's nine major planets may be numbered.	
</P>
<P>
	Two groups within the International Astronomical Union are  
thinking about reclassifying the relatively puny planet -- either 
calling it a ``minor planet'' or lumping it in with an entirely new 
class of objects. 
</P>
<P>
	``For at least 20 years, it's been obvious that Pluto doesn't  
fit,'' said University of Maryland astronomer Mike A'Hearn, who 
heads the Planetary Systems Sciences Division of the International 
Astronomical Union. 
</P>
<P>
	With a diameter of only 1,440 miles, Pluto, the planet farthest  
from the sun, is smaller than the moon. And while other ``major 
planets'' have roughly circular orbits, Pluto carves out a sweeping 
ellipse that frequently takes it closer than Neptune, planet No. 8, 
to the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	A'Hearn wants to create a new class of objects for ice balls  
that orbit beyond Neptune and call them Trans-Neptunian Objects. 
Pluto would be Trans-Neptunian Object No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Marsden of the International Astronomical Union's Minor  
Planet Center said he has a better idea: reclassify Pluto as a 
``minor planet,'' of which there are thousands, then make it take a 
number. The prized number 10,000 will probably come up next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a demotion,'' for Pluto to be referred to as the  
10,000th minor planet, Marsden insisted. ``It's an honor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Mexico astronomer Alan Hale, co-discoverer of Comet  
Hale-Bopp, suggested the debate is somewhat silly since there's 
really no clear definition of what a planet is. And, besides, ``a 
hypothetical resident of Jupiter would probably laugh at our 
calling Earth a `major planet.'''

<HEADLINE> Suicide Suspected in Price's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NACOGDOCHES, Texas (AP) -- A neighbor called 911 after hearing  
screams. A minute later, a shot rang out and former Stephen F. 
Austin basketball star Katrina Price was dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Price, 23, was found slumped on top of a shotgun early Monday.  
Police Sgt. Paul Peterson said it appeared the shooting was a 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were no signs of a struggle and there appeared to be a  
shotgun lying under the body, which would tend to lead us toward 
that conclusion,'' Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Price lived in an apartment with her sister, Lucrettia ``Lucy''  
Price. According to Peterson, Lucrettia awoke to find her sister 
holding the shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people who lived downstairs heard screaming,'' Peterson  
said. ``Apparently, Lucy had woken up and had found Katrina. It 
appears she was frantically trying to talk Katrina out of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The neighbors called police to report the fight. They then  
called back to report the shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was less than a minute between the two 911 calls,''  
Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Price, who attends SFA, is not a suspect, police  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Katrina Price was a third-team All-America player last season  
when she averaged 22.1 points and 5.3 rebounds per game. The 
5-foot-10 guard was the Ladyjacks' all-time leading scorer with 
2,278 points, and she's among the SFA's top 10 in seven other 
categories. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are all devastated,'' said SFA athletics director Steve  
McCarty. ``Every member on that team either played with Katrina 
last season or knew of her. This is a very emotional time in their 
lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monday night's game between Stephen F. Austin and Sam Houston  
State in Hunstville was postponed because of Price's death. 
University counselors worked with the players and coaches to help 
cope with the loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Price tried out for the WNBA but went undrafted. She was offered  
the chance to attend a free-agent camp, but instead opted to join 
the American Basketball League. 
</P>
<P>
	The Long Beach StingRays made Price the seventh overall pick in  
the May draft, but the team disbanded before she ever played a 
game. She was placed on the Philadelphia Rage roster in August and 
was a reserve when the league filed for bankruptcy in December when 
it could no longer compete with the higher-profile WNBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Price, a Waco native, led La Vega High to the state finals her  
senior season and graduated second in her class. She received her 
bachelor's degree from SFA last May and was enrolled in graduate 
courses for the spring semester, which began last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Katrina was the epitome of a student-athlete,'' said McCarty.  
``She graduated from here with honors and she played with honor. 
She did everything to the utmost of her ability with class and 
character.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Price was the Southland Conference's marquee player during her  
four years. 
</P>
<P>
	She played in all but one of the 123 games in her career,  
starting 120 of them. She was the first four-time member of the 
league's all-tournament team, a three-time all-conference player 
and a two-time winner of the SLC's player of the year award. 
</P>
<P>
	Price is survived by eight sisters: DeLores Turner, Glenda  
Shead, Margaret Banks, Carolyn Eagan, LaVell Price, DeShanda Price, 
Lesia Phillips and Lucrettia Price. 
</P>
<P>
	The sisters released a statement through their aunt, Barbara  
Price, saying: 
</P>
<P>
	``The family is saddened by the loss of our loved one. Katrina  
was a most generous and loving person. We were so proud of her. She 
always tried to set an example through basketball to the youth in 
the community.''

<P>
	Some of President Clinton's proposals in his State of the Union  
address: 
</P>
<P>
                          	 *RETIREMENT   	
</P>
<P>
	--Transfer 62 percent of nation's expected budget surpluses over  
the next 15 years -- $2.7 trillion -- to the Social Security account 
to keep the program solvent until 2055. 
</P>
<P>
	--Invest 25 percent of that money in the stock market in search

	Clinton Defense Opens  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- White House Counsel Charles Ruff opened  
President Clinton's defense today by telling senators at the 
impeachment trial the president was innocent of a ``witches' brew 
of charges'' brought by House prosecutors. Ruff attacked the 
conclusions of the Republican congressmen as a ``rush to 
judgment.'' Clinton is accused of perjury and obstruction of 
justice in connection with his affair with a former White House 
intern. The White House also added some congressional Democrats to 
the defense team, possibly Reps. John Conyers of Michigan and Tom 
Barrett of Wisconsin.

	Jones: Ex-Lawyers Should Get Nothing  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Paula Jones' lawyers say her original  
legal team abandoned her case and is not entitled to any part of 
the $850,000 that President Clinton paid to settle her sexual 
harassment lawsuit. Lawyers Joseph Cammarata and Gilbert K. Davis, 
who successfully argued to the Supreme Court that Clinton should 
stand trial while still in office, are seeking $875,000 in fees and 
expenses. Mrs. Jones' most recent lawyers, the Dallas law firm of 
Rader, Campbell, Fisher &AMP; Pyke, said in a court filing today that 
Cammarata and Davis cannot make a valid claim to the money because 
they ``abandoned'' her.

	London Pinochet Hearing Continues  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Lawyers for Spain and Britain seeking to quash  
Gen. Augusto Pinochet's immunity claim argued today that 
international law protects no one from prosecution for crimes 
against humanity, including heads of state. The former Chilean 
dictator was arrested in London on a Spanish warrant alleging he 
ordered murders, kidnapping and torture during his 1973-90 rule. 
Pinochet's lawyers contend his Oct. 16 arrest is illegal under 
British law because the alleged acts were carried out when he was 
Chile's leader. If Pinochet loses, a lengthy extradition battle 
would begin.

	Court Won't Revive Redlining Suit  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today refused to revive a  
massive civil rights lawsuit against many of the nation's largest 
insurance companies filed on behalf of 93,000 homeowners living in 
predominantly black neighborhoods of St. Louis and Kansas City, Mo. 
The 1996 lawsuit accused insurance companies of discriminatory 
``redlining'' -- refusing to sell homeowners insurance on equal 
terms based on the racial composition of their neighborhoods. The 
insurance companies were accused of conspiring to violate the 
federal Fair Housing Act.

	Michigan 'Madam' Gets Probation  
</P>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- The Huntington Woods Madam, accused of  
running a million-dollar-a-year call-girl ring in a Detroit suburb, 
was placed today on two years' probation. Marci Devernay pleaded 
guilty to racketeering in exchange for the dismissal of five other 
counts related to the prostitution ring she allegedly ran out of 
her home. Last week, police released 7,000 names from her 
computerized little black book. In addition, police said there are 
another 7,000 names on Ms. Devernay's Rolodex and about 6,000 more 
in paper files that will be released later.

	HIV-Positive Private Pleads Guilty  
</P>
<P>
	ABERDEEN, Md. (AP) -- An HIV-infected Army private pleaded guilty  
today to aggravated assault for having unprotected sex with nine 
men. Pfc. Gerland Squires also pleaded guilty to disobeying a 
superior officer who ordered her to tell her partners she carried 
the virus. She could get up to 77 years in prison. An Army 
spokesman said Ms. Squires learned she had AIDS in mid-1997 when 
taking a blood test. Prosecutors said she had sex with six enlisted 
men and three civilians between February and October of last year.

	Ravens Hire Billick As Coach  
</P>
<P>
	OWINGS MILLS, Md. (AP) -- Minnesota offensive coordinator Brian  
Billick was hired as coach of the Baltimore Ravens today, two days 
after the Vikings lost to Atlanta in the NFC championship game. 
Billick had also interviewed with the Cleveland Browns, but the 
expansion team yesterday said Billick was no longer a candidate. 
The Ravens fired coach Ted Marchibroda after a 6-10 season. Under 
Billick's direction, the Vikings scored an NFL-record 556 points 
this regular season.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Finish Higher / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A powerful rally in technology stocks, fueled by  
the latest Internet merger, sent the Nasdaq Stock Market rocketing 
to new highs and pulled a laggard Dow industrials out of a slump 
late in Tuesday's session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average, at one point down as much as  
130.54, recovered to close up 14.67 at 9,355.22. 
</P>
<P>
	Even more impressive was the 59.97-point gain, a rise of 2.5  
percent, in the Nasdaq composite index, which closed at a record 
2,408.17, a lift that spilled over to the blue-chip industrials, 
said Larry Wachtel, market strategist at Prudential Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq barreled past its previous closing high of 2,384.59,  
which was set Jan. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a moonshot,'' Wachtel said of the performance of the  
technology heavy Nasdaq market. ``When you have powerful stocks 
like Microsoft, Dell and Cisco doing that well, it's very hard to 
keep the rest of the market sitting there doing zippo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite opened sharply higher and pressed upward  
all day, after At Home Corp. agreed to purchase Internet company 
Excite in a $6.7 billion stock swap. Excite's stock shot up 42 1/2 to 
close at 110, and At Home's shares rose 13 3/8 to 115 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was not hampered, as it was for part of last week, by  
news from Brazil. After rocking world markets by devaluing its 
currency last Wednesday, Brazil's Senate passed a key austerity 
measure Tuesday in a first step to shore up the country's ailing 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's Bovespa index closed 3.8 higher in Sao Paulo, Latin  
America's largest market. 
</P>
<P>
	On the New York Stock Exchange, advancing issues barely  
outnumbered decliners as volume was moderately heavy at 952.96 
million shares as of 4 p.m., off slightly from Friday's session. 
The market was closed on Monday for Martin Luther King Jr. Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Advances in blue-chip stocks were crimped most of the day by  
fears that Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan might attempt to cool the 
market's recent advances when he testifies Wednesday before the 
House Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors remember well the chairman's ``irrational exuberance''  
speech in December of 1996, when the Dow was trading at around 
6,500. At the time, Greenspan questioned whether stocks were 
trading at values far too rich to be justified by earnings 
projections and general outlook on the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The comment produced a brief stumble in stocks. But the Dow is  
now some 3,000 points higher and there continue to be jitters on 
whether stocks are overvalued. 
</P>
<P>
	Any hint that Greenspan is reasserting his ``irrational  
exuberance'' warning will squelch already dim hopes that the Fed 
will ease interest rates soon, said Eugene Peroni, market analyst 
at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of the big moves in Internet stocks and the fact that  
the down has gone on to make a new high recently, the bias seems to 
favor that he will be a bit more cautious,'' Peroni said. 
</P>
<P>
	A flood of earnings reports proved mixed. Chase stock rose 3 1/2  
points to 74 3/8 after the bank said it earned $1.31 per diluted share 
in the fourth quarter, up from 94 cents a share a year ago and 
topping analysts' expectations of $1.19 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	But BankAmerica's stock fell 5/8 to 64 after that bank said it  
earned 91 cents per diluted share, down from 94 cents a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 8.74 to 1,252.00 , the NYSE  
composite index rose 1.44 to 594.83, and the American Stock 
Exchange composite index fell 1.68 to 707.61. The Russell 2000 
index of smaller companies rose 3.84 to 430.89. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, the Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo fell 0.25 percent, the  
DAX index in Frankfurt rose 0.45 percent, the FT-SE 100 index in 
London fell 1.57 percent, and the CAC index in Paris declined 0.86 
percent.

<HEADLINE> Disputed Stem Cell Research Financed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a move that could speed new treatments for  
devastating diseases but that also raises ethical questions, the 
Clinton administration is about to finance research using ``master 
cells'' -- the building blocks of tissue that scientists have culled 
from human embryos. 
</P>
<P>
	Studying how to harness these embryonic stem cells and turn them  
into therapies for Alzheimer's disease or diabetes, as well as ways 
to prevent birth defects and rebuild damaged organs, is considered 
one of the most promising new frontiers of science. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also controversial because these ``master cells'' are  
present only in early-stage human embryos. Some anti-abortion 
groups in particular call stem cell research morally unacceptable, 
because to get the cells, embryos would have to be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now the research has largely been taboo, because federal  
law prohibits using taxpayers' money for research using human 
embryos. 
</P>
<P>
	But scientists working last year with scarce private funding  
succeeded in isolating some embryonic stem cells -- both from 
aborted fetuses and from unused embryos from infertility treatments 
-- and succeeded in multiplying the stem cells in laboratories to 
grow a supply for research. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the National Institutes of Health, the main provider of  
money for U.S. medical research, says that because these lab-grown 
stem cells do not constitute an embryo, it thus is legal for NIH to 
fund experiments using them -- and it will do so within months. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know this is ethically sensitive territory,'' NIH Director  
Harold Varmus said Tuesday after announcing the decision before 
President Clinton's National Bioethics Advisory Commission. But 
``the prospects of benefit to living human beings ... are 
dramatic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stem cells are the basic or primordial cells from which all of a  
human's tissues and organs develop. By themselves, the cells can't 
grow into a person. 
</P>
<P>
	But if scientists could control how the cells switch on to form  
different bodily tissues, they might produce lifesaving therapies: 
Growing heart cells to rebuild disease-ravaged hearts, or 
insulin-producing cells for diabetics, or new brain cells for 
victims of Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The NIH's decision ``is terrific'' because it will speed that  
research ``absolutely by years,'' said Dr. John Gearhart of Johns 
Hopkins University, who grew one of the stem cell supplies from 
aborted fetuses. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, NIH involvement will ensure the science is done  
with the public scrutiny not possible when private companies 
control the purse strings, Gearhart added. 
</P>
<P>
	Abortion opponents immediately decried the decision.  
</P>
<P>
	``Today's announcement ... is the latest step by the Clinton  
administration to treat human beings as property to be manipulated 
and destroyed,'' said Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	NIH money will allow researchers to ``experiment with cells  
obtained from human beings ruthlessly killed in the first weeks of 
life,'' said Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	The congressman didn't say whether he would challenge NIH's  
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of Congress' ban, NIH ``will not fund the act of  
destruction itself, but will reward those who destroy embryos by 
paying them to develop the cells and tissues they have obtained by 
destructive means,'' said Richard Doerflinger of the National 
Conference of Catholic Bishops. 
</P>
<P>
	The bioethics commission will wrestle with other questions: How  
appropriate is it to derive stem cells from live human embryos? 
After all, University of Wisconsin scientists successfully used 
spare embryos with the full consent of couples treated at 
infertility clinics, who donated the embryos they didn't end up 
using to attempt a pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
	And what if doctors one day decide they want to create an embryo  
solely for the purpose of deriving stem cells -- which means growing 
the embryo to destroy it? 
</P>
<P>
	It also may be possible to use cloning techniques to derive  
human stem cells by, for instance, placing human genes into an 
animal's egg to grow a hybrid embryo. 
</P>
<P>
	Varmus says he does not expect Congress to stop his funding  
plans. Indeed, Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Penn., who heads the 
subcommittee that controls NIH's budget, has been investigating 
stem cell research and praised the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got the potential for enormous advances in medical  
science and we should utilize them,'' Specter said. Even where stem 
cells did come from live embryos, they were embryos destined to be 
discarded ``that could not be used to produce human life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Within months, NIH will draw up guidelines that set just what  
kind of research the agency will fund.

	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Left-hander Terrell Wade, who spent  
most of Tampa Bay's inaugural season on the disabled list 
recovering from shoulder surgery, agreed Tuesday to a $250,000, 
one-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Wade, 25, was the team's 30th selection in the 1997 expansion  
draft from the Atlanta Braves. He started two games on the Devil

during a rehabilitation assignment with Class A St. Petersburg and 
Triple-A Durham. 
</P>
<P>
	In his two appearances for Tampa Bay, Wade was 1-1 with a 5.06  
ERA in 10 2-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Wade was one of two Devil Rays who filed for arbitration last

<HEADLINE> Court Allows Prudential Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today left intact a $2  
billion class action settlement over allegations that insurance 
agents for Prudential Insurance Co. misled policyholders over a 
13-year period. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices, without comment, rejected appeals from some  
policyholders who challenged the 1997 settlement's fairness. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement covered more than 8 million policyholders who may  
have been duped into buying devalued insurance policies. Of the 
potential class members, only 1.1 million had applied by last 
summer to receive any compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators concluded that Prudential agents routinely lied to  
prospective policyholders to make sales during the period of Jan. 
1, 1982, to Dec. 31, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	When U.S. District Judge Alfred Wolin in Newark, N.J., approved  
the settlement, some class members objected and appealed. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the settlement  
last October. 
</P>
<P>
	``The district court's finding that the proposed settlement was  
fair, reasonable and adequate was well within its sound 
discretion,'' the appeals court ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Malakof, a Pittsburgh, Pa., lawyer representing some of  
the objecting class members, said the settlement requires 
policyholders to do too much and compensates only ``those people 
who are sophisticated enough to file a 16-page claim form.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fewer than 20,000 people acted in time to ``opt out'' of the  
settlement and reserve the right to sue on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	Malakof said many policyholders likely will continue to pay  
premiums to the Newark-based insurance company for years before 
realizing they were misled about their policies' ultimate value. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the appeals acted on today argued that such an unwieldy  
group of potential beneficiaries never should have been certified 
as a ``class.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The appeal said the Prudential settlement conflicts with a 1997  
Supreme Court decision that made it more difficult to find 
nationwide solutions in massive liability litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Prudential and some class members urged the justices  
to reject the appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	The cases are Krell vs. Prudential Insurance, 98-819, and  
Johnson vs. Prudential Insurance, 98-888.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Address-6 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	With her was someone who has been very important to the relief  
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Sports records are made, and sooner or later, they are broken.  
But making other people's lives better -- and showing our children 
the true meaning of brotherhood -- that's something that lasts 
forever. So for far more than baseball, Sammy Sosa, you are a hero 
of two countries. 
</P>
<P>
	If we do all these things -- pursue peace, fight terrorism,  
increase our strength and renew our alliances -- then we will begin 
to meet our generation's historic responsibility to build a 
stronger 21st century America in a freer, more peaceful world. 
</P>
<P>
	As the world has changed, so have our own communities. We must  
make them safer, more livable, more united. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, we will reach our goal of 100,000 community police  
officers -- ahead of schedule and under budget. The Brady Bill has 
stopped a quarter million felons, fugitives and stalkers from 
buying handguns. Now, the murder rate is the lowest in 30 years, 
and the crime rate has dropped for six straight years. 
</P>
<P>
	Tonight, I propose a 21st century crime bill to deploy the  
latest technologies and tactics to make our communities even safer. 
</P>
<P>
	My balanced budget will help put up to 50,000 more police on the  
beat in the areas hardest hit by crime, and to equip them with new 
tools, from crime-mapping computers to digital mug shots. 
</P>
<P>
	We must break the deadly cycle of drugs and crime. My budget  
expands support for drug testing and treatment. It says to 
prisoners: If you stay on drugs, you stay behind bars. And it says 
to those on parole: To keep your freedom, keep free of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress should restore the 5-day waiting period for buying a  
handgun. And you should extend the Brady Bill to prevent juveniles 
who commit violent crimes from buying a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	We must keep our schools the safest places in our communities.  
</P>
<P>
	Last year, we were horrified and heartbroken by the tragic  
killings in Jonesboro, Paducah, Pearl, Edinboro, Springfield. We 
are deeply moved by the courageous parents who are working to keep 
guns out of the hands of children -- so that other parents don't 
have to live through their loss. 
</P>
<P>
	One of them is Suzann Wilson of Jonesboro, Ark. After she lost  
her daughter, she came to the White House with a powerful plea: 
``Please, please, for the sake of your children, lock up your guns. 
... Don't let what happened in Jonesboro happen in your town.'' She 
is here tonight with the first lady and we thank her for her 
courage and commitment. In memory of all the children who lost 
their lives to school violence, let's strengthen the Safe and 
Drug-Free School Act. Let's pass legislation to require child 
trigger locks. Let's keep our children safe. 
</P>
<P>
	A century ago, President Theodore Roosevelt defined our ``great,  
central task'' as ``leaving this land even a better land for our 
descendants than it is for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today, we are restoring the Florida Everglades, saving  
Yellowstone, preserving the red-rock canyons of Utah, protecting 
California's redwoods and our precious coasts. 
</P>
<P>
	But our most fateful new challenge is the threat of global  
warming. 1998 was the warmest year ever recorded. Last year's heat 
waves, ice storms, and floods are but a hint of what future 
generations may endure if we don't act now. 
</P>
<P>
	So tonight, I propose a new clean air fund to help communities  
reduce pollution, and tax incentives and investments to spur clean 
energy technologies. And I will work with Congress to reward 
companies that take early, voluntary action to reduce greenhouse 
gases. All communities face a preservation challenge, as they grow, 
and green space shrinks. Seven thousand acres of farmland and open 
space are lost every day. In response, I propose two major 
initiatives: first, a one-billion-dollar Livability Agenda to help 
communities save open space, ease traffic congestion, and grow in 
ways that enhance every citizen's quality of life; second, a 
one-billion-dollar Lands Legacy Initiative to preserve places of 
natural beauty all across America -- from the most remote wilderness 
to the nearest city park. I thank Vice President Gore for his 
visionary leadership in helping to develop these historic 
proposals. To get the most out of your community, you have to give 
something back. That's why we created AmeriCorps -- our national 
service program that gives today's generation a chance to serve 
their communities and earn money for college. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, in just four years, 100,000 young people have built  
low-income homes with Habitat for Humanity, helped tutor children, 
worked with FEMA to ease the burden of natural disasters and 
performed countless other acts of service that have made America 
better. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of them are here with us tonight. I thank them for their  
service -- and I ask Congress to give more young Americans the 
chance to follow their lead. 
</P>
<P>
	We must work to renew our national community for the 21st  
Century.

<HEADLINE> Busy Day for Justice Rehnquist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist might  
accomplish a first today, presiding over the Supreme Court and 
President Clinton's impeachment trial, then attending the 
president's State of the Union address. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief justice presided over the Supreme Court's regularly  
scheduled session this morning as the court issued orders and heard 
oral arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	Rehnquist appeared testy at times during arguments in a  
Pennsylvania case. At one point, he told a lawyer, ``You've been 
asked several questions. Try to answer the question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the afternoon, he was crossing the street to oversee the  
day's impeachment trial proceedings in the Capitol's Senate 
chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	In the evening, Rehnquist can complete the triple-header by  
attending Clinton's annual State of the Union address before a 
joint session of Congress in the House chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	Supreme Court justices traditionally sit on the front row in  
their judicial robes, remaining silent as various members of 
Congress interrupt the president's speech with applause or cheers. 
</P>
<P>
	However, not all of the justices attend every time, and it was  
possible Rehnquist would stay away to avoid any appearance of a 
conflict because of his role in the impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Rehnquist, an amateur artist, once skipped the president's  
address to attend the first night of an adult-education painting 
class in suburban Arlington County. That happened in 1984, two 
years before he was elevated to chief justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg declined comment Monday on  
whether the chief justice planned to attend the president's 
address. The court typically does not announce in advance which 
justices will attend a State of the Union speech. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other chief justice to preside over a presidential  
impeachment trial was Chief Justice Salmon Chase, who oversaw the 
1868 trial in which President Andrew Johnson was acquitted by one 
vote. Presidents sent their State of the Union messages to Congress 
in written form at that time, and Johnson delivered his message 
months before the trial.

<HEADLINE> High Court To Rule on Sex Bias Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The NCAA, accused of discriminating against  
female athletes in the way it enforces eligibility rules, wants the 
Supreme Court to shield it from lawsuits based on a federal law 
banning sexual bias in educational programs receiving federal 
financial aid. 
</P>
<P>
	After hearing arguments today, the justices will decide sometime  
by late June whether the anti-bias law known as Title IX of the 
Education Amendments of 1972 applies to the National Collegiate 
Athletic Association. 
</P>
<P>
	If so, the NCAA will have to defend itself against Renee Smith's  
accusations that she illegally was declared ineligible years ago 
for intercollegiate volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
	A focal point of the three-year legal battle is whether the  
powerful NCAA can be considered an indirect recipient of federal 
aid because of the dues it collects from its 1,200 member schools -- 
virtually all of whom are federally subsidized. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith has some firepower on her side. The Clinton administration  
is urging the court to rule for her and keep her 1996 lawsuit 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who lives in Wintersville, Ohio, played volleyball for  
St. Bonaventure University in the 1991-92 and 1992-93 seasons. She 
chose not to participate the following season, and graduated in 
less than three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith later pursued a graduate degree at Hofstra University and  
a law degree at the University of Pittsburgh. At each, her attempts 
to play two more seasons of volleyball were thwarted by an NCAA 
rule that bars graduate students from competing in intercollegiate 
athletics at a school other than the one from which they earned 
their undergraduate degree. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's lawsuit says the NCAA grants male student-athletes a  
disproportionate number of waivers from that eligibility rule. But 
the NCAA, noting that many more men apply for such waivers, says a 
higher percentage of female applicants are granted them. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge threw out Smith's lawsuit, but the 3rd U.S.  
Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated her Title IX claim last year. 
``The NCAA is not merely an incidental beneficiary of federal 
funds,'' the appeals court ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith is now a lawyer, licensed to practice in California and  
about to take the Ohio bar examination in February. She works for 
her father's mining and industrial supply company, and last fall 
was an assistant volleyball coach at Weir High School in Weirton, 
W.Va. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is NCAA vs. Smith, 98-84.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seen Urging New Trade Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton plans to call for a new  
round of global trade negotiations in his State of the Union speech 
tonight, hoping to counter protectionist forces set loose by the 
current worldwide financial turmoil, a senior administration 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
	The official, speaking on grounds of anonymity, said Clinton  
would seek to ensure that a broad range of trade areas would be 
covered by the talks, which would be launched in December at a U.S. 
meeting of the more than 120 nations that are members of the World 
Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will frame the request for new trade talks as an answer  
to the current global economic turmoil. Forty percent of the world 
has been plunged into recession and he still-prosperous U.S. 
economy has suffered record-high trade deficits as American 
exporters lose overseas markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president believes these negotiations are more important  
than ever because of the financial turmoil,'' said the 
administration official. ``This period of financial stress puts a 
lot of pressure on our trading partners to backtrack on reform and 
openness and the president sees a new round as keeping the momentum 
going for openness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new round of talks would require Congress to grant the  
president new trade negotiating authority to conduct the 
discussions under a ``fast track'' that would prohibit Congress 
from amending the agreement once it is reached. However, Clinton 
has been blocked for several years in his efforts to win a renewal 
of fast-track authority because of disputes over how labor and 
environmental issues should be treated in trade negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration wants to include protection of worker rights  
and the environment in trade discussions, which traditionally focus 
on how to lower trade barriers so goods can flow more freely 
between nations. But Republicans, backed by American businesses, 
have balked at this suggestion, warning that it risks diluting the 
main purpose of the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	European and Japanese officials had been urging the United  
States to back a new, comprehensive round of negotiations but the 
administration had been debating internally just how broad those 
talks should be, fearing a repeat of the experience under the last 
global trade talks. That Uruguay Round, launched in 1986 in Punta 
del Este, Uruguay, dragged on for seven years because countries 
could not reach agreement on all facets of the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	It is possible the new round could be called the Clinton Round  
since the president is proposing the talks and they will be 
launched at a ministerial meeting in the United States in December, 
according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported 
Clinton's decision in today's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	One other round of global talks was named for a U.S. president,  
the Kennedy round conducted from 1964 to 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	The location for the U.S. conference has not been set although  
several cities, including Dallas, Detroit and Honolulu, are under 
consideration as a site.

<HEADLINE> White Sox Sign Baldwin for $1.9M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Right-hander James Baldwin got a six-fold salary  
increase Tuesday, agreeing to a $1.9 million, one-year contract 
with the Chicago White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	Baldwin, 27, was 10-3 with a 3.68 ERA during the second half of  
last season, finishing 13-6 with a 5.32 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	``James is a key part of our starting rotation for 1999, and it  
is great to have his contract situation resolved,'' general manager 
Ron Schueler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Baldwin's 13 victories in 1998 were a career high and marked the  
third straight season he has won 10 games or more. He also has 
struck out 100 or more hitters in each of the past three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Second baseman Ray Durham, the last White Sox player in  
arbitration, asked for a raise from $1,935,000 to $4.3 million. He 
was offered $3.35 million.

<HEADLINE> Tigers Name Female Groundskeeper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) -- Groundbreaking achievement is nothing  
new for the first woman ever named head groundskeeper for a major 
league baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
	The Detroit Tigers said Tuesday that Heather Nabozny will direct  
grooming at Tiger Stadium starting March 1. She replaces Frank 
Feneck, who is retiring after more than 35 years on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	At age 28, she's among the youngest head groundskeepers in the  
majors. 
</P>
<P>
	For Nabozny, who spent five years as head groundskeeper for the  
West Michigan Whitecaps, the Tigers' west Michigan minor league 
affiliate, the position is a chance to hone what she calls her 
``passion for perfection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The child of a lawn-care company owner, Nabozny fell in love  
with grass long before she ever earned a degree in turf management. 
</P>
<P>
	``Taking care of a surface that players play on is incredible,''  
she said Tuesday, her voice growing more animated as she described 
the importance of moisture on the diamond and customizing the 
infield to individual player's needs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like baseball, but I watch more how the ball plays rather  
than the game ... whether the cleats stick, how the ball bounces,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just doing my job like everyone else,'' she said, adding  
she's not intimidated at the thought of directing a ground crew of 
as many as 15 men. ``I've always worked with males. Going to school 
I was the only one in the turf program. I'm pretty used to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nabozny's job will include moving the team into a new stadium in  
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Heather has obviously done an outstanding job with the field  
in West Michigan,'' Tigers assistant general manager Steve 
Lubratich said in a statement. ``We look forward to her bringing 
the same level of expertise and enthusiasm to the grounds here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My advice to Heather is do what she's doing and don't listen  
to anybody,'' said George Toma, who has spent more than 40 years 
groundskeeping for the Kansas City Royals and more than 30 years 
with the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	He was impressed when he met Nabozny two years ago. ``Some of  
the women, they're going to do a better job than the men. Heather's 
going to do a good job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nabozny may not always be in a league of her own. There are a  
handful of women groundskeepers in the minor and major leagues 
already working their way up the ranks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a really big deal,'' said Connie Rudolph, head  
groundskeeper for the St. Paul Saints, a minor league team in St. 
Paul, Minn. ``She's going to be a real model for a lot of girls. 
... She was chosen because she's going to do an excellent job.''

<HEADLINE> Court Mulls Workers' Compensation Pay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Those insurers who pay workers state-required  
compensation for injuries suffered at work are no more an arm of 
the government than other private insurance companies are, a lawyer 
for the providers told the Supreme Court on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The determination is key to whether insurers could be sued for  
violating employees' due-process rights under the Constitution. A 
judge had dismissed claims filed by employees who found their 
benefits cut off in Pennsylvania pending a review. 
</P>
<P>
	Several other states also authorize the withholding of disputed  
payments while a review is pending, and a ruling in the employees' 
favor could raise questions about the integrity of those state 
laws. Insurers argued that such dispute-resolution mechanisms are 
legal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Private companies regularly withhold payments during  
disputes,'' said Michael W. McConnell, an attorney for several of 
the workers comp insurers. ``If you're involved with a fender 
bender and you have a dispute, the insurance company will decline 
to pay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Loralyn McKinley, representing 10 employees, considered workers  
compensation a state benefit because state law mandated coverage 
and created a complex regulatory scheme governing payments and 
dispute resolution. 
</P>
<P>
	``The individual is trapped in the system and is not permitted  
to go outside the system,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Stephen G. Breyer questioned that premise, noting that  
dozens of other insurance types are heavily regulated as well, some 
of which carry state-assisted backup funds to cover liability the 
insurers cannot cover themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you claim that all insurance that is regulated is a state  
action?'' he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Pennsylvania's 1993 workers compensation law only requires  
employers to pay for ``reasonable'' and ``necessary'' medical care 
for employees who suffer work-related injuries or disease and to 
pay money as partial replacement of lost wages. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to the spiraling costs of medical treatment, the  
state Legislature gave insurers authority to withhold payments for 
disputed medical bills until a review, which usually takes a few 
months, is completed. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is American Manufacturers Mutual Insurance Co. vs.  
Sullivan, 97-2000.

<HEADLINE> Arctic Ozone Loss Could Pose Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The densely populated regions of North America  
and Europe could face the threat of increased ultraviolet radiation 
if ozone loss over the Arctic, such as occurred in 1996 and 1997, 
resumes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ozone in the upper atmosphere blocks the sun's ultraviolet rays,  
which can cause sunburn, skin wrinkling, eye damage and even 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Thinning of that layer over the Antarctic in the 1980s led to  
the ban on ozone-damaging chemicals, such as certain refrigerants 
and spray-can propellants. 
</P>
<P>
	But those chemicals already released remain in the air for  
years, and researchers now are reporting potentially serious 
thinning of the ozone layer over the Arctic, where there is a 
greater hazard to people if the damage spreads. 
</P>
<P>
	It's too soon, however, to declare a definite trend, said the  
scientists, noting that the situation improved a bit last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Damage to the ozone layer was first noticed in the Antarctic,  
where circular winds, known as a vortex, trap air, giving chemicals 
the chance to react with the ozone. 
</P>
<P>
	The Antarctic is usually colder than the Arctic, causing more  
frequent stratospheric clouds of the type that lead to ozone 
depletion within the vortex. In 1996-1997, however, the Arctic 
vortex produced low temperatures and ozone depletion as great as 
that recorded in the Antarctic during the early 1980s, the 
researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	This threatens to ``allow the penetration of enhanced UV  
radiation at northern mid-high latitudes,'' warn researchers in the 
latest issue of the Journal of Geophysical Research, published by 
the American Geophysical Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the sparsely populated region in the southern mid- to  
high-latitudes, an expanded area of damaged ozone in the north 
could affect parts of Europe and North America. 
</P>
<P>
	Georg Hansen of the Norwegian Institute for Air Research in  
Tromso, Norway, and Martyn P. Chipperfield of Cambridge University 
in England studied the northern ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
	``In particular, if Arctic (ozone) depletion persists later in  
the year, as in 1997, more UV will penetrate to the surface when 
the sun is higher in the sky in late spring and summer,'' 
Chipperfield said in an interview via electronic mail. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is the possibility that the Arctic may becoming more  
Antarctic-like,'' he said. ``Certainly 1997 was nearer than other 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Chipperfield added, ``the winter polar vortex in the  
Arctic is very variable, and last year (1997-98) the vortex was 
warm, weak and there was little ozone loss. It is too soon to 
detect a definite trend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hansen and Chipperfield, using data collected from the Norwegian  
island of Andoya, reported that in 1995-1996 and 1996-1997, overall 
ozone depletion reached a maximum of 48 percent below the long-term 
average and up to 60 percent at the most affected altitude, 12 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
	And the 1996-1997 vortex lasted exceptionally long, into early  
May, extending the period of reduced ozone levels. This led in turn 
to increased ultraviolet radiation in northern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Reductions in the northern ozone layer have also been reported  
by scientists at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration and National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

<HEADLINE> Reagan Son To Head Conservative PAC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gary Bauer, a conservative activist preparing  
to run for president, has tapped Ronald Reagan's son to head his 
political action committee while he seeks the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Reagan, a California-based radio talk show host, will  
take over as head of the Campaign for Working Families once Bauer 
establishes a presidential exploratory committee, said Tim 
Goeglein, spokesman for the PAC. He is expected to form the 
committee next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer has raised more than $6 million in two years with the PAC,  
building a political base he hopes will propel him to the GOP 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	In another move to free himself up for 2000, Bauer resigned  
Friday as chairman of the Family Research Council, one of the 
nation's fastest-growing conservative advocacy groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer likely will face stiff competition for support of social  
conservatives. The field almost certainly will include better-known 
conservatives, such as Vice President Dan Quayle and publisher 
Steve Forbes.

<HEADLINE> Interest Rates Fall in T-Bill Sale / T-Bills  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury  
securities fell in Tuesday's auction to the lowest level in nearly 
three months. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department sold $7.51 billion in three-month bills  
at a discount rate of 4.280 percent, down from 4.390 percent last 
week. An additional $7.5 billion was sold in six-month bills at a 
rate of 4.310 percent, down from 4.405 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The rates were the lowest since Oct. 26, when three-month bills  
sold for 4.070 percent and the six-month rate was 4.155 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors  
-- 4.387 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling 
for $9,891.80 and 4.467 percent for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,782.10. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Tuesday that the  
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index 
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 4.51 
percent last week from 4.55 percent the previous week.

	White House To Open Clinton Defense  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawyers for President Clinton today will begin  
their defense aimed at keeping Clinton from becoming the first 
president thrown out of office. Clinton's defense team is expected 
to focus on conflicts in testimony gathered by Independent Counsel 
Kenneth Starr, a shift in strategy aimed at undercutting House 
charges of perjury and obstruction of justice, sources say. 
Officials say the president's lawyers are thinking about asking 
some Democrats from the House Judiciary Committee to join the 
defense team. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton To Address Nation  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- On the same day that his lawyers begin  
defending him against impeachment charges in a trial in the Senate, 
President Clinton is set to deliver his State of the Union address. 
Clinton will promote an ``ambitious and activist agenda'' for the 
remainder of his term, hoping to move attention away from his legal 
trouble. Aides say his speech is brimming with ideas on education, 
health care, Social Security and other issues. But White House 
officials concede that the GOP-controlled Congress won't rush to 
approve the agenda of a president many Republicans want to see 
removed from office.

	Internet Firm AtHome To Buy Excite

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- High-speed Internet provider AtHome is buying  
World Wide Web search engine Excite for about $6.7 billion in stock 
in one of the largest Internet company deals ever. The deal would 
surpass America Online's $4.2 billion acquisition of Netscape last 
year. The deal could eventually give AT&AMP;T control of one of the 
highly sought-after portals that serve as entry points onto the 
Internet. AtHome is owned by Tele-Communications, and TCI is in the 
process of merging with AT&AMP;T. Excite has lagged behind other 
Web-site companies, such as Yahoo!, and has been looking for a 
larger partner.

<P>
	BEDFORD, Pa. (AP) -- Gusty rain and snowstorms pounded the  
Midwest and Northeast last night, knocking out power to thousands 
of people and causing accidents from Illinois to New England. 
Farther west, blowing snow caused whiteout conditions in Minnesota 
and Illinois, closing schools and causing a number of accidents. 
The storms knocked out power to at least 23,500 customers in 
Pennsylvania 24,000 in Connecticut and 18,000 in New Jersey. 
Inbound flights to Newark Airport in New Jersey were delayed as 
much as six hours. Wind gusts as high as 71 mph were reported.

ignoring demands by NATO and the United States to honor a 
three-month-old cease-fire in Kosovo. The renewed fighting 
indicates that the government was not softening its hard-line 
campaign against the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which 
is seeking independence from Serbia, the main Yugoslav republic. 
The Serb-led government yesterday ordered the American head of the 
international peace verification mission to leave the country 
within 48 hours and barred the chief U.N. war crimes prosecutor 
from entering Kosovo to investigate the massacre of 45 ethnic 
Albanians.

Housing and Urban Development and the Fort Worth Human Relations 
Commission reached a settlement. Chief Executive Officer Dave 
Gallitano said the only agreement with HUD is to continue to bring 
home mortgage loans to low-to-moderate income families. Columbia 
National was accused of violating the Fair Housing Act by making 
too few loans to minority or low-to-moderate income families.

<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks fell in light trading today as the  
market reacted little to the prime minister's pledge to ensure 
economic recovery. The Nikkei closed down 34.62 points at 
13,770.44. 

</P>
<P>
	Many NBA Moves Expected  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With the finalization of the settlement of the  
NBA lockout looming, all sorts of deals are being made, from 
Scottie Pippen heading to the Houston Rockets to Latrell Sprewell 
going to the New York Knicks. When the new collective bargaining 
agreement is put into writing, which could be as early as tonight, 
teams will be allowed to finalize deals. But many moves are now set 
to go, including the Chicago Bulls dumping All-Star Pippen on the 
Houston Rockets for marginal forward Roy Rogers and a second-round 
pick. Also, NBA sources said the Golden State Warriors would trade 
controversial but high-scoring guard Sprewell to the Knicks.

<HEADLINE> Quotes on Senate Impeachment Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- On a day in which the Senate impeachment trial  
entered its second week and in which President Clinton delivered 
his State of the Union address, here are some of the comments heard 
on Capitol Hill: 

</P>
<P>
	``We have one of those unique moments in history when we can do  
something about a very, very important program for all Americans, 
and that's to put security back in the Social Security program.'' -- 
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Tonight's speech was a good example of why Congress should  
stop attacking Bill Clinton. ...Despite the partisan attacks he's 
been under, Bill Clinton has never lost sight of what the American 
people really care about: good jobs, strong families and a vibrant 
economy.'' -- Rep. Bob Brady, D-Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important for Republicans to demonstrate that they can  
govern. With a tiny majority we have, the only way we can do that 
is to compromise with the president. We should not respond to the 
president's proposal with knee-jerk, negative reaction.'' -- Rep. 
William Greenwood, R-Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I think as soon as this trial is over, whether it's this  
president or another president, we will be dealing with these 
issues.'' -- Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of us were troubled coming here right in the middle of a  
trial where we're supposed to be deciding matters fairly and 
objectively. We should keep our poise. We're supposed to be 
deciding matters fairly and objectively, not by whether or not the 
president can make a great speech.'' -- Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a great speech. Getting on with the nation's business  
is what the American people want the president and Congress to be 
doing.'' -- Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``We revere the presidency and the office of the president, and  
we are able to compartmentalize ..., greeting the president in the 
chamber and proceeding with impeachment.'' -- Rep. George Gekas, 
R-Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Actually much of it is doable. A lot of it is doable, but if  
we spend a couple of months on impeachment we'd have an atmosphere 
around here where almost none of it is doable.'' -- Sen. Patrick 
Leahy, D-Vt. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``It was great politics and theater. He proposed more new  
programs. I don't know if I can count them all. He was spending all 
of the surplus. ... He set a very partisan tone, engaging an area 
and then veering immediately to the Democratic side. That's what I 
regret about it.'' -- Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``From farms to crime to education, it was the kind of things  
Americans could listen to, perhaps quizzically and ask where all 
the money is coming from, but there will be priorities.'' -- Sen. 
Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The tape from the calculator is still rolling down the Capitol  
steps. He's going to have to step back from his extensive agenda 
and focus on the critical issues.'' -- Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``He did everything but buy a new dress for the Statue of  
Liberty.'' -- Rep. Joseph Moakley, D-Mass.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Offers Ramadan Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton marked the end of Islam's  
holiest month Tuesday with a wish that living conditions will 
improve soon for the people of Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	In videotaped remarks, Clinton offered his best wishes to  
adherents of Islam for completing a month of fasting in observance 
of Ramadan, saying their sacrifice provided the lesson of 
discipline. 
</P>
<P>
	``It delivers a profound reward -- the chance to teach people of  
every faith what is precious about Islam: Its charity, its 
generosity, its essential humanity,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said he hopes ``we will see the lives of the Iraqi  
people improve. They have suffered for too long from oppression and 
war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president also called for ``a rising tide of peace on  
Earth'' in the Middle East, Asia, Iran, Afghanistan and Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the leader of a nation of many, many faiths, I pledge that  
we will do all we can to strengthen relations with the Islamic 
community around the world in the year ahead,'' Clinton said. ``In 
the United States, we deeply respect the Muslim Americans who 
observe Ramadan. And we look forward to working with Muslims 
everywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke by videotape in honor of Id al-Fitr, a three-day  
feast celebrating the end of Ramadan.

<HEADLINE> HIV-Positive Private Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ABERDEEN, Md. (AP) -- An HIV-infected Army private pleaded guilty  
Tuesday to aggravated assault for having unprotected sex with nine 
men. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfc. Gerland Squires, 21, also pleaded guilty to disobeying a  
superior officer who ordered her to tell her partners she carried 
the virus. 
</P>
<P>
	She could get up to 77 years in prison.  
</P>
<P>
	She reached a plea bargain at the start of her trial Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Ms. Squires had sex with six enlisted men and  
three civilians between February and October of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Army spokesman John Yaquiant said that after taking a blood test  
to get married, Ms. Squires learned in mid-1997 that she was 
infected with the AIDS virus. Yaquiant said he did not know whether 
she got married. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Squires was stationed at Aberdeen Proving Ground, which was  
rocked by a sex scandal in 1997 when drill sergeants were accused 
of forcing female recruits to have sex. Eleven instructors were 
convicted or resigned. One instructor was cleared. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to the scandal, the Army pledged to do a better job  
of screening drill sergeants and added ethics training for 
recruits.

<HEADLINE> Ravens Give Billick Six-Year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Art Modell plans to keep his new head coach  
around for a long, long time. 
</P>
<P>
	Modell signed Brian Billick to a six-year contract Tuesday, less  
than 24 hours after the Minnesota Vikings' offensive coordinator 
began the interview process with the Baltimore Ravens owner over a 
friendly dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully this is one of many contracts,'' Modell said at a  
news conference at the Ravens' stadium at Camden Yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Billick, architect of the Vikings' record-setting offense this  
season, didn't need to have his arm twisted to take the job. He 
first became enamored with Baltimore when the Vikings visited in 
December, and his opinion didn't change during his return trip. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the minute I arrived here to play the Baltimore Ravens to  
this point right now, I've been nothing but overwhelmed by this 
organization,'' Billick said. 
</P>
<P>
	Billick has been the Vikings' offensive coordinator for five  
years. Minnesota scored an NFL-record 556 points during the regular 
season, with a team-record 6,264 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``What sold me on him was his performance. What he has done in  
Minnesota hasn't been achieved by anyone else,'' Modell said. ``He 
probably had the most potent team in NFL history in Minnesota.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Star Tribune of Minneapolis, Billick will  
receive $9 million for six years, the most lucrative contract ever 
given to a first-time head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``Six years is a minimum gamble. This is a good man,'' Modell  
said. ``We waited for the opportunity to interview Brian, and we're 
glad we did. He has a wonderful passion for the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Billick became eligible to interview for the Ravens job after  
the Vikings were eliminated from the playoffs Sunday with a 30-27 
overtime loss to the Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	``We spoke to 28 people about Brian, including the best man at  
his wedding,'' said David Modell, the owner's son and a key figure 
in the interview process. ``We knew we had an incredible 
high-quality candidate, someone we knew would do a terrific job 
leading this franchise now and for a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Billick, 44, takes over a team that went 6-10 last season and  
16-31-1 in three years under Ted Marchibroda, who was fired Dec. 
28. Marchibroda was hired shortly after the franchise's departure 
from Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Billick signed with the Ravens one day after the expansion  
Cleveland Browns dropped him as a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Before speaking to Billick, Modell interviewed Jacksonville  
Jaguars offensive coordinator Chris Palmer, Pittsburgh Steelers 
defensive coordinator Jim Haslett and Philadelphia Eagles defensive 
coordinator Emmitt Thomas, who ended up taking a job in Green Bay 
under new coach Ray Rhodes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ravens originally hoped to get Packers coach Mike Holmgren,  
who took a job with the Seattle Seahawks before following through 
with his planned interview in Baltimore. Modell also considered 
talking to former San Francisco 49ers coach George Seifert, who 
signed with Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Billick, however, was hardly a consolation pick. The Ravens were  
desperate to revive an offense that finished 14th in the 15-team 
AFC in total yardage, and Billick comes to Baltimore with a 
reputation as an offensive whiz. 
</P>
<P>
	But his prowess extends beyond the dizzying numbers that the  
Vikings rolled up this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brian did an excellent job with the Vikings,'' said Frank  
Gilliam, Minnesota's vice president of player personnel. ``He's a 
guy we hate to lose, and we expect him to be successful with the 
Ravens.''

<HEADLINE> Study: Urbanites Have Buying Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Despite having only a limited number of stores  
in their neighborhoods, inner-city residents still buy clothes, 
electronics and furniture more often than the average American 
household, a new study shows. 
</P>
<P>
	While it's been known that urban America is a largely untapped  
retail market, the study, expected to be released today, 
illustrates the significant purchasing power found in inner cities 
and what these residents want to buy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone is chasing after retailing in places like Beverly  
Hills, but very few are chasing places like the south side of 
Chicago,'' said Anne Habiby, director of research for the 
Boston-based Initiative for a Competitive Inner City, which did the 
study with the accounting and consulting firm 
PricewaterhouseCoopers. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they don't realize is that the inner cities have a much  
higher disposable retail dollar than almost any suburban square 
mile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study of 1,205 inner-city households was done by mail in  
October and November 1997, and the results were compared with an 
existing PricewaterhouseCoopers database of shoppers nationwide. 
The new report is a more detailed version of two other reports 
issued last June. The Initiative said this is the first time that 
such a vast amount of material has been collected on a national 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
	The study shows that inner-city shoppers spend nearly 11 percent  
more on clothing annually than the average U.S. household. 
African-Americans buy the most, almost 30 percent more than the 
average American consumer. 
</P>
<P>
	Many also spend generously on their homes. Forty-three percent  
of inner-city shoppers said they purchase furniture, compared with 
30 percent of all U.S. shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-one percent of African Americans and 37 percent of  
Hispanics bought a television, VCR or stereo in the past year, 
compared with 25 percent of average U.S. households. 
</P>
<P>
	When they shop, urban consumers have greater brand loyalty than  
the average population. They are also more apt to look for stores 
that accept credit cards and offer superior customer service. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also highlights inner-city shoppers' demand for better  
prices, especially for groceries and clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	While there is clearly room for growth in the inner cities, the  
market is still severely underserved. Most retail sales are 
relegated to small, specialty stops, which are expensive and carry 
only a limited inventory. 
</P>
<P>
	The intention of the study is to show well-known national retail  
chains that there is a huge potential of the urban market. Only 
handful of stores, like the drug store chain Rite-Aid and Sears, 
currently operate stores in inner cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest push is for an increased number of discount chains,  
like Target and Wal-Mart, in urban areas. Inner-city shoppers spend 
significantly less than the average consumer at these stores, even 
though they are the biggest area of growth in U.S. retailing today.

<HEADLINE>  Knicks To Get Sprewell in Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Knicks emerged as the winning  
bidder in the Latrell Sprewell auction, and the three-time All-Star 
is expected to be dealt to New York as soon as the lockout ends, 
sources told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Two league sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the  
Knicks beat out the Miami Heat and Indiana Pacers in the bidding 
for Sprewell, whose attack on Golden State Warriors coach P.J. 
Carlesimo last season led to one of the harshest penalties in NBA 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks will send John Starks and Chris Mills to the  
Warriors, two league sources said today. New York originally 
offered Mills and guard Chris Childs. 
</P>
<P>
	Warriors general manager Garry St. Jean told all interested  
teams to make their best offers by 4 p.m. EST Monday. The New York 
Times and San Jose Mercury News said Seattle and Portland made late 
bids, which a source close to the Trail Blazers said was not true. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell, who will make $9 million next season, will elevate the  
Knicks to the status of the top Eastern Conference contender. 
</P>
<P>
	He joins the Knicks' other shooting guard, Allan Houston, in a  
three-guard formation much like New York used for most of last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks, Heat and Pacers had been known to be the leading  
bidders in the Sprewell sweepstakes, and the AP learned a 
complicated four-team trade involving Golden State, Miami, 
Cleveland and Boston also was discussed. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell would have gone to the Heat along with Bimbo Coles and  
Clarence Weatherspoon, with Golden State getting Brent Barry, Dan 
Majerle and Bobby Sura. Boston would have received Jamal Mashburn 
and Vitaly Potapenko, and Cleveland would have received Paul Pierce 
and Andrew Declercq. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the league's most notorious choke artist -- as Sprewell  
has come to be known for obvious reasons -- will be playing in the 
harsh spotlight of the nation's media capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell has averaged 20.1 points over his six-year career,  
including a career-high 24.2 points in 1996-97. 
</P>
<P>
	He was suspended for one year and had his contract terminated by  
the Warriors for his attack on coach Carlesimo in December 1997, 
although an arbitrator reduced the suspension to 68 games and 
reinstated the final two years of his contract after a hearing last 
February. 
</P>
<P>
	No deals can be completed until the lockout settlement is put  
into writing, which won't happen until Tuesday night at the 
earliest. If the deal is set Tuesday night, trades and free agent 
signings will begin Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Warms to Surprising Falcons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- During 20 years as an Atlanta Falcons  
season-ticket holder, Steve Holman often got disheartened -- so much 
so two years ago that he let the ticket renewal deadline pass. 
</P>
<P>
	But right afterward, he had a change of heart.  
</P>
<P>
	``I thought, all these years -- one of these days it's going to  
pay off,'' he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	So he rushed down to the Falcons ticket office and was allowed  
to renew his season tickets without losing his seniority. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday he was celebrating that spur-of-the-moment decision  
after learning he'll be able to buy two of the hottest tickets in 
town. In the aftermath of Atlanta's first NFC title, fans were 
flocking to the Falcon bandwagon to join the loyalists who saw the 
team through losing seasons in 13 of the previous 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've endured this for so many years,'' Holman said. ``All of  
them who were always saying, `You're a fool' for buying those 
tickets every year are the ones who've been calling me now saying, 
`Hey, you got any playoff tickets?' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a lot of fun. ``Our day has come!''  
</P>
<P>
	Under an NFL formula, each participating team will receive about  
11,000 tickets, to be distributed to staff and club associates and 
then split among season-ticket holders via a lottery. 
</P>
<P>
	Holman, a Powder Springs, Ga., industrial supply salesman, was  
notified he could buy two Super Bowl tickets from the Falcons at 
$325 each. Other veteran fans were calling ticket brokers who said 
single tickets were starting at $1,650 each. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, sports-related businesses already were gearing up for  
the big day Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're working on our game plan now,'' Tony Choice, manager at  
a Buffalo's Cafe in suburban Marietta, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his restaurant sold $400 worth of takeout chicken wings  
even before it opened its doors Sunday and another seven 40-pound 
cases of wings to customers who dined in and watched the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are hoping this is going to be a big bonus,'' said Diana  
Harris, president of Glorious Events catering. 
</P>
<P>
	She said her business, which usually caters many  
business-related Super Bowl parties, could jump by a third for this 
year's game, adding another $50,000 in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's all totally speculative,'' added the 27-year veteran of  
the catering business. ``I'm a native Atlantan and we've never done 
a Falcons Super Bowl before. So it's going to be interesting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Braves Clubhouse store in the CNN Center, manager Don  
Shields said ``tons of people'' had called or come by looking for 
Falcons Super Bowl shirts and caps. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be hot -- probably as big as when the Braves won  
their first championship,'' Shields said. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Tolbert, 18, of Douglasville, had already been waiting  
more than an hour at the store for the caps due to arrive Monday 
afternoon. But he showed no impatience. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been waiting a long time for this,'' Tolbert said.  
``I've been waiting all my life. Who would think the Falcons are 
going to be in the Super Bowl?''

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Beats Earnings Estimates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Strong growth in personal computer shipments late  
last year helped software giant Microsoft Corp. produce a 72 
percent increase in second-quarter profits, easily beating Wall 
Street estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Microsoft remains worried about the global economy, and  
about whether the need to fix the Year 2000 computer problem will 
keep corporations from buying new software, Greg Maffei, 
Microsoft's chief financial officer, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft had net income of $1.98 billion and diluted earnings  
per share of 73 cents for the quarter ended Dec. 31, up from $1.13 
billion or 42 cents a share a year ago. Analysts surveyed by First 
Call had expected 59 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for the quarter were $4.94 billion, up 38 percent from  
$3.59 billion a year ago. The quarterly profits and revenues were 
records. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every now and again, they have a quarter that really takes  
your breath away,'' said analyst Scott McAdams of McAdams Wright 
Ragen Inc. in Seattle. ``Clearly, they beat the street, and 
handsomely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's Windows operating system runs the vast majority of  
personal computers, and healthy sales during the holidays for new 
PCs, especially cheaper models aimed at home users, meant more 
money for Microsoft, Maffei said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of Windows NT, an operating system for high-end  
workstations and computer networks, likewise were robust. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft has now licensed more than 25 million copies of the NT  
version for workstations, including 3 million new licenses in the 
most recent quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand also remained strong for Microsoft's Office suite of  
business software, even though a new version is expected out in the 
next few months. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Maffei said he expected Microsoft's financial  
performance to remain strong through its fiscal year that ends June 
30, the company is worried about uncertainties in the Asian and 
Latin American markets as well as the effect of the Year 2000 
computer bug. 
</P>
<P>
	Many companies might decide not to buy any new software this  
year that isn't related to fixing the bug, which may cause computer 
systems performing calculations involving dates to begin generating

<P>
	Maffei made no mention of the ongoing antitrust trial against  
Microsoft and other cases the company is fighting, except to note 
that general and administrative costs had risen to $149 million 
from $106 million, ``due, in part, to higher legal costs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of its fiscal year, Microsoft had net  
earnings of $3.67 billion or $1.35 a diluted share on revenues of 
$8.89 billion, up from profits of $1.8 billion or 67 cents a share 
on revenues of $6.72 billion in the year-ago period.

<HEADLINE> For TV Networks, Big Coverage Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Impeachment was about the only thing President  
Clinton didn't mention during his State of the Union address. 
</P>
<P>
	But television cameras filled in the blanks -- and then some --  
Tuesday night by continually linking Clinton's performance with his 
chances of surviving a Senate impeachment trial where his lawyers 
defended him earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS, ABC, NBC and the cable news networks twice interrupted  
regular programming Tuesday. In the afternoon, they covered lawyer 
Charles Ruff's opening statement on Clinton's behalf before the 
Senate and, in prime time, they covered the president's annual 
message to the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many people here in the Capitol are struck by the `what ifs' --  
what could be done, what might be done, without the impeachment 
trial hanging over the country,'' ABC's Peter Jennings said after 
Clinton spoke. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not the first time coverage of Clinton's State of the  
Union speech left networks distracted. Last year, the Monica 
Lewinsky story had just broken and, the year before, Clinton 
competed with the verdict in O.J. Simpson's civil trial, NBC's Tom 
Brokaw noted. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton stressed the nation's prosperity and a laundry list of  
proposals. He tried for home run after home run with TV viewers, 
pointing out guests like Sammy Sosa and Rosa Parks in the House 
gallery. 
</P>
<P>
	``The White House believes the best defense against impeachment  
is a strong offense tonight,'' NBC's Tim Russert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps even more than usual during a partisan speech,  
Republicans on camera looked like they'd much rather be elsewhere. 
Many frowned, sat uncomfortably and made clapping motions so softly 
it seemed they were hoping no one would hear. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, I don't know if they applauded at all,'' said CBS's  
Dan Rather. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS's Scott Pelley and ABC's Cokie Roberts both said Clinton  
changed portions of his speech to appear conciliatory to Congress. 
``He is trying very hard to work with the people who are trying 
him,'' Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's many policy statements were brushed over in the  
post-speech commentary. Instead, analysts focused on what the 
president's performance would mean for his chances of surviving the 
Senate trial. NBC used its analysis time to chase the story of when 
the Senate might vote on whether to proceed with the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC commentator Bill Kristol, a former GOP activist, said he had  
spoken to a top Republican during the speech who was impressed by 
Clinton's toughness. ``It was an impressive performance,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennings said Clinton appeared ``awkward at times and nervous.''  
</P>
<P>
	Commentators treated the speech as the second part of Clinton's  
defense strategy for the day after Ruff's arguments before the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff was given good grades for a low-key presentation. NBC's  
Gwen Ifill said Ruff was so soft-spoken it may have obscured how 
harshly he criticized House impeachment managers. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN's Candy Crowley called it ``the most cogent defense of the  
president we've heard to date.''

<HEADLINE>  2 Japan Banks in Tentative Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- In the latest sign of consolidation in Japan's  
troubled banking industry, two trust banks have reached a tentative 
agreement to merge. 
</P>
<P>
	The union of Chuo Trust &AMP; Banking Co. and Mitsui Trust &AMP; Banking  
Co. would create a rival to the country's largest trust bank, 
Mitsubishi Trust &AMP; Banking Co. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing the deal Tuesday, executives from the two banks  
said they hope to complete the deal in April 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike commercial banks catering to retail customers, trust  
banks specialize in managing funds for corporations, pensions and 
big individual investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal comes as Japanese banks struggle to dispose of piles of  
bad loans left from the collapse of property prices nearly a decade 
ago. Many banks have been left holding land as collateral for 
soured loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Those loan problems and sweeping deregualtion in Japan's finance  
industry have prompted many banks to restructure or form alliances, 
often with foreign firms, in order to survive. 
</P>
<P>
	But the combination of Mitsui and Chuo would be the first full  
merger involving major banks since the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi 
Ltd. was formed in 1996 to create a major commercial bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the final arrangements for the deal have not been  
finished, the banks tentatively agreed that one Mitsui Trust share 
would be exchanged for three-tenths of a Chuo Trust share, which 
would value the merger at $1.63 billion as of the close of trading 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	At a press conference, Mitsui president Keiu Nishida and Chuo  
president Shozo Endo said that Chuo would lead the combined 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Together the banks would have assets of some $138 billion,  
second among trust banks only to Mitsubishi Trust and Banking, 
which has $158 billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies had combined revenues of $10 billion in the year  
ended last March. Mitsui is currently Japan's third largest trust 
bank and Chuo the sixth-biggest. 
</P>
<P>
	The banks said they expect current tie-ups with foreign partners  
-- such as the alliance between State Street Trust &AMP; Banking Co. and 
Mitsui Trust -- will contribute to the merged bank.

<HEADLINE> Court OKs $1-A-Head Beef Ad Fee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today left intact the  
$1-per-head fee cattle producers must pay on all cattle sold in or 
imported to the United States to fund generic advertising for beef 
and beef products. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, without comment, rejected a Kansas cattle rancher's  
challenge to the fee required by a 1985 federal law, the Beef 
Promotion and Research Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Goetz's lawsuit, filed on behalf of all other cattle  
producers, contended that the fee violates free-speech and 
equal-protection rights and amounts to an unlawful tax. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge and the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled  
against Goetz and upheld the assessment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The objective of the act is valid and the stimulation of the  
beef market is a proper regulatory activity,'' the appeals court 
ruled last July. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court said the fee is not a tax because its primary  
purpose is not to raise revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	In rejecting Goetz's free-speech and equal-protection arguments,  
the appeals court relied on a 1997 Supreme Court decision that 
upheld a federal program forcing some fruit producers to pay for 
generic ads to promote their industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Goetz vs. Glickman, 98-607.

<HEADLINE>  Knicks To Get Sprewell in Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Knicks emerged as the winning  
bidder in the Latrell Sprewell auction, and the three-time All-Star 
is expected to be dealt to New York as soon as the lockout ends, 
sources told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Two league sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the  
Knicks beat out the Miami Heat and Indiana Pacers in the bidding 
for Sprewell, whose attack on Golden State Warriors coach P.J. 
Carlesimo last season led to one of the harshest penalties in NBA 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks will send John Starks and Chris Mills to the  
Warriors, two league sources said today. New York originally 
offered Mills and guard Chris Childs. 
</P>
<P>
	Warriors general manager Garry St. Jean told all interested  
teams to make their best offers by 4 p.m. EST Monday. The New York 
Times and San Jose Mercury News said Seattle and Portland made late 
bids, which a source close to the Trail Blazers said was not true. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell, who will make $9 million next season, will elevate the  
Knicks to the status of the top Eastern Conference contender. 
</P>
<P>
	He joins the Knicks' other shooting guard, Allan Houston, in a  
three-guard formation much like New York used for most of last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks, Heat and Pacers had been known to be the leading  
bidders in the Sprewell sweepstakes, and the AP learned a 
complicated four-team trade involving Golden State, Miami, 
Cleveland and Boston also was discussed. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell would have gone to the Heat along with Bimbo Coles and  
Clarence Weatherspoon, with Golden State getting Brent Barry, Dan 
Majerle and Bobby Sura. Boston would have received Jamal Mashburn 
and Vitaly Potapenko, and Cleveland would have received Paul Pierce 
and Andrew Declercq. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the league's most notorious choke artist -- as Sprewell  
has come to be known for obvious reasons -- will be playing in the 
harsh spotlight of the nation's media capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell has averaged 20.1 points over his six-year career,  
including a career-high 24.2 points in 1996-97. 
</P>
<P>
	He was suspended for one year and had his contract terminated by  
the Warriors for his attack on coach Carlesimo in December 1997, 
although an arbitrator reduced the suspension to 68 games and 
reinstated the final two years of his contract after a hearing last 
February. 
</P>
<P>
	No deals can be completed until the lockout settlement is put  
into writing, which won't happen until Tuesday night at the 
earliest. If the deal is set Tuesday night, trades and free agent 
signings will begin Wednesday.

<HEADLINE>  PGA Tour Rolling in the Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Two weeks gone, halfway home to a million.  
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, it took until the third week of February before  
anyone on the PGA Tour climbed past the $500,000 mark in season 
earnings. David Duval was the first, but only after two top-10 
finishes in California, a tie for 27th at Phoenix, then a win at 
Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Sluman just spent the first two weeks of the year in Hawaii  
and returned to the mainland with $531,050, thanks to a tie for 
13th in the season-opening Mercedes Championships and winning the 
Sony Open in Honolulu last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The good news for the PGA and its rich new world of golf is  
this: Sluman has not said anything about taking the rest of the 
year off. 
</P>
<P>
	At least not yet.  
</P>
<P>
	As the PGA embarks on a year in which total prize money is up 40  
percent to $132 million, one of the concerns is that more will mean 
less -- the more money a player makes, the less he is likely to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's conceivable,'' Duval said, ``that come the U.S. Open,  
there might be a player at $3.5 million if you win the right 
events. That's all great. He could say, `I'll take off and see 
y'all at the Tour Championship.' 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem with that is you're going to lose some competitive  
sharpness. And you might lose it for a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Mickelson can attest to that.  
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, he won at Pebble Beach and was runner-up in the  
Sprint International and World Series to move from 13th to second 
on the money list. Mickelson took the next six weeks off and 
returned in style -- he missed the cut at Las Vegas, missed the cut 
at Disney and finished 17th out of 30 players in the Tour 
Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Tim Finchem expects growing pains to come with the  
largest increase in total prize money since it tripled to about 
$450,000 the year after the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	At the root of the change are the three World Golf Championships  
events, which account for one-third of the $36 million in new 
money. Finchem's hope is that more players will play more 
tournaments, instead of taking corporate money for private outings 
or appearance money overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	``This level of prize money allows us to compete more  
effectively for the attention of our players,'' he said. ``Our 
focus is to have a system whereby the total number of tournament 
starts on average by the top 30 or top 50 players is as good or 
better than it was before. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that will happen.''  
</P>
<P>
	Tiger Woods already has suggested that he may drop a few  
tournaments to compensate for the Match Play Championship in late 
February and the Stroke Play Championship in November. 
</P>
<P>
	If Ernie Els wins Match Play and has $3 million by the end of  
the PGA Championship, will he have enough incentive to play until 
the last few weeks of the season? 
</P>
<P>
	Will Greg Norman play more tournaments to prepare for the five  
$5 million events and the four majors, or less to be fresh for 
them? 
</P>
<P>
	``Are we going to have a few growing pains? Probably,'' Mark  
O'Meara said. ``I think when you look at what's happened, the 
purses and stuff going up, you can sit there and say, `That's good, 
that's bad, that's this or that.' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's wonderful. It's a nice problem to have these $3  
million or $5 million events for players to compete at a very high 
level. If they play well, they're rewarded. In that aspect, I don't 
see the players going on strike sometime soon. I think they're 
going to be playing more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And there certainly will be more at stake than the size of the  
bank account, which was true even when first place didn't pay more 
than $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	To take chunks of time off during the summer could put some  
players in jeopardy of dropping in the Ryder Cup points standings. 
Voting for player of the year likely will come down to the wire, as 
will the battle for No. 1 on the money list. And winning the money 
list is still a priority for most players, whether it takes $2.6 
million or $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're going to keep up with David Duval, who's going to  
play 26 or 27 times, you better play,'' Finchem said. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval is only in his fifth year on tour, but he understands the  
importance of a good schedule -- not so much how many tournaments, 
but building a routine and sticking with it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The money isn't something you think about when you're  
playing,'' Duval said. ``But it's awfully nice when you're done.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Invites Guests to Address </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A teacher involved in a gun safety program, a  
Vietnamese refugee who mentors high school students and a mother 
fighting to prevent school violence were among the guests invited 
to President Clinton's State of the Union address on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Joanna Quintana-Barroso, Loc Truong and Suzann Wilson will be  
sitting with first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton as Clinton delivers 
his annual speech to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Barroso teaches third grade at Little Havana's Coral Way  
Elementary School, a school with innovative programs including 
alternative education classes for at-risk children, a Stop the 
Violence Day and Drug Awareness Week. 
</P>
<P>
	The 29-year-old teacher has also been involved with the school's  
curriculum-based gun safety program, which encourages students to 
stay away from guns and violence with weapons by having them sign a 
symbolic pledge. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a city school with a realistic perspective on what's  
going on,'' she said of the K-5 elementary school where she has 
taught for seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	Truong, 23, mentors students at San Luis Obispo High School in  
California through AmeriCorps, the president's domestic volunteer 
program. He works with eight students, helping them with homework, 
looking for jobs and serving as a role model for appropriate 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	He moved to San Luis Obispo 18 years ago after leaving his  
native Vietnam on a boat with his parents and seven siblings. Two 
years ago, he graduated from college with a degree in biochemistry, 
with the intention of becoming a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	But his experiences with Americorps during the past two years  
have persuaded him to become a high school principal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just love working with kids,'' he said. ``That is where my  
passion is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Wilson called for stronger laws to prevent school violence  
after her daughter was among those slain in last year's school 
shooting in Jonesboro, Ark. Her 11-year-old daughter, Britthney 
Varner, three other students and a teacher were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Wilson said after the shootings that she wanted to do  
something positive, such as keeping children away from firearms. 
Ms. Wilson and her sister, Regina Kaut, created People Against 
Violence Everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	In the months after the shootings, Ms. Wilson made her case  
before Arkansas legislators. Gov. Mike Huckabee formed a citizen's 
group to make recommendations on how to reform the state's juvenile 
justice system.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets closed lower Tuesday,  
with share prices slipping in Tokyo on news that Japan faces a 
prolonged economic slump. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 34.62  
points, or 0.25 percent, closing the day's trading at 13,770.44. On 
Monday, the average gained 66.20 points, or 0.48 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the market reacted little to the Tuesday afternoon  
opening of the new regular session of Japan's Parliament, where 
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi again pledged to do his best to ensure 
economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	But the mood of pessimism was heightened by a closely watched  
government report that said that despite mild improvements, the 
Japanese economy remains mired in a prolonged slump. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of Japanese bankruptcy cases was the highest last  
year since 1984, while the amount of liabilities left was the 
largest since World War II, according to a report released by 
Teikoku Databank, a private credit research agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar slipped against the yen as the market  
continued to watch developments in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	In late afternoon, the dollar bought 114.04 yen, down 0.10 yen  
from late in Tokyo on Monday and also below its late New York level 
of 114.35 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Brazil's central bank made permanent a temporary  
decision last week to allow the real to trade at market rates in 
foreign exchange trading without any intervention. The move risks 
sparking a new surge of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices in Hong Kong slumped, pushed down by profit-taking  
and lingering concern over Brazil's economic health. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue-chips, fell 112.43 points, or 1.0 percent, to close at 
10,290.11. On Monday, the index surged 255.14 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said prices fell as investors took profits following  
Monday's sharp gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Market participants also remained concerned about Brazil's high  
level of debt, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	If Brazil falls into an Asian-style currency crisis, its economy  
-- Latin America's largest -- could drag down other nations in the 
region, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The markets were closed in Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia  
for holidays. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower as worries over corporate  
earnings persisted. The market's key Weighted Stock Price Index 
fell 33.89 points, or 0.5 percent, to 6,343.36. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher, boosted by a

<HEADLINE> Clinton Address-1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	President Clinton's State of the Union address, as delivered:  
</P>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, honored  
guests, my fellow Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Tonight, I have the honor of reporting to you on the State of  
the Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Let me begin by saluting the new speaker of the House, and  
thanking him especially tonight for extending invitations to two 
special guests who are sitting in the gallery with Mrs. Hastert. 
Lyn Gibson and Wei Ling Chestnut are the widows of the two brave 
Capitol Hill Police officers who gave their lives to defend 
freedom's house. 
</P>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, at your swearing in you asked us all to work  
together in the spirit of civility and bipartisanship. Mr. Speaker, 
let's do exactly that. 
</P>
<P>
	Tonight I stand before you to report that America has created  
the longest peacetime economic expansion in our history -- with 
nearly 18 million new jobs, wages rising at more than twice the 
rate of inflation, the highest homeownership in history, the 
smallest welfare rolls in 30 years -- and the lowest peacetime 
unemployment since 1957. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time in three decades, the budget is balanced.  
From a deficit of $290 billion in 1992, we had a surplus of $70 
billion last year AND NOW We are on course for budget surpluses for 
the next 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to the pioneering leadership of all of you, we have the  
lowest violent crime rate in a quarter century and the cleanest 
environment in a quarter century. 
</P>
<P>
	America is a strong force for peace from Northern Ireland, to  
Bosnia, to the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to the pioneering leadership of Vice President Gore, we  
have a government for the information age, once again, a government 
that is a progressive instrument of the common good, rooted in our 
oldest values of opportunity, responsibility and community, devoted 
to fiscal responsibility, determined to give our people the tools 
they need to make the most of their own lives in the 21st century, 
a 21st century government for 21st century America. 
</P>
<P>
	My fellow Americans, I stand before you to report that the state  
of our union is strong. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, America is working again. The promise of our future is  
limitless. But we cannot realize that promise if we allow the hum 
of our prosperity to lull us into complacency. How we fare as a 
nation far into the 21st century depends upon what we do as a 
nation today. 
</P>
<P>
	So with our budget surplus growing, our economy expanding, our  
confidence rising, now is the moment for this generation to meet 
our historic responsibility to the 21st century. 
</P>
<P>
	Our fiscal discipline gives us an unsurpassed opportunity to  
address a remarkable new challenge: the aging of America. 
</P>
<P>
	With the number of elderly Americans set to double by 2030, the  
baby boom will become a ``senior boom.'' So first and above all, we 
must save Social Security for the 21st century. (Applause.) 
</P>
<P>
	Early in this century, being old meant being poor. When  
President Roosevelt created Social Security, thousands wrote to 
thank him for eliminating what one woman called the ``stark terror 
of penniless, helpless old age.'' Even today, without Social 
Security, half our nation's elderly would be forced into poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Social Security is strong. But by 2013, payroll taxes  
will no longer be sufficient to cover monthly payments. And by 
2032, the trust fund will be exhausted, and Social Security will be 
unable to pay out the full benefits older Americans have been 
promised. 
</P>
<P>
	The best way to keep Social Security a rock-solid guarantee is  
not to make drastic cuts in benefits; not to raise payroll tax 
rates; and not to drain resources from Social Security in the name 
of saving it. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, I propose that we make the historic decision to invest  
the surplus to save Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, I propose that we commit 60 percent of the budget  
surplus for the next 15 years to Social Security, investing a small 
portion in the private sector just as any private or state 
government pension would do. This will earn a higher return and 
keep Social Security sound for 55 years. 
</P>
<P>
	But we must aim higher. We should put Social Security on a sound  
footing for the next 75 years. We should reduce poverty among 
elderly women, who are nearly twice as likely to be poor as our 
other seniors -- and we should eliminate the limits on what seniors 
on Social Security can earn. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, these changes will require difficult but fully achievable  
choices over and above the dedication of the surplus. They must be 
made on a bipartisan basis. They should be made this year. So let 
me say to you tonight, I reach out my hand to all of you in both 
houses and both parties and ask that we join together in saying to 
the American people: We will save Social Security now. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, last year, we wisely reserved all of the surplus until we  
knew what it would take to save Social Security. Again, I say, we 
shouldn't spend any of it, not any of it, until after Social 
Security is truly saved. First things first. Second, once we have 
saved Social Security, we must fulfill our obligation to save and 
improve Medicare. Already, we have extended the life of the 
Medicare trust fund by 10 years -- but we should extend it for at 
least another decade. Tonight I propose that we use one out of 
every six dollars in the surplus for the next 15 years to guarantee 
the soundness of Medicare until the year 2020. 
</P>
<P>
	But again, we should aim higher. We must be willing to work in a  
bipartisan way and look at new ideas, including the upcoming report 
of the bipartisan Medicare commission. If we work together, we can 
secure Medicare for the next two decades and cover the greatest 
growing need of seniors -- affordable prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Third, we must help all Americans, from their first day on the  
job, to save, to invest, to create wealth. From its beginning, 
Americans have supplemented Social Security with private pensions 
and savings. Yet today, millions of people retire with little to 
live on other than Social Security. Americans living longer than 
ever simply must save more than ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Therefore, in addition to saving Social Security and Medicare, I  
propose a new pension initiative for retirement security in the 
21st century.

<HEADLINE> Domingo Marks 30th Met Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Maybe not quite all of Placido Domingo's opera  
appearances have been triumphs, but most have been -- and the 
2,800th certainly was. 
</P>
<P>
	Domingo's strong, virile tenor voice rang out Sunday afternoon  
in a special gala for the Metropolitan Opera Pension Fund, as he 
performed the first act of ``Faust,'' the second act of 
``Stiffelio'' and the third and fourth acts of ``Carmen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The best lyric-dramatic tenor of the late 20th century may be 57  
but, amazingly, he sings as if he's in his prime. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the performance, Met president Joseph Volpe announced  
that Domingo was celebrating the 30th anniversary season of his Met 
debut and was making his 2,800th career performance. Volpe thanked 
``this special artist'' for everything he has given to the Met. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe also announced that conductor James Levine, after leading  
the Friday rehearsal, had developed flu and a high fever and would 
be replaced by Marco Armiliato, who made his Met debut this season 
with ``La Boheme.'' Armiliato proved excellent. Paul Plishka also 
replaced Roberto Scandiuzzi, who was ill, as Mephistopheles in 
``Faust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Domingo had sung the title role of ``Stiffelio'' when the Met  
first performed Verdi's 1850 opera in six years ago. On Sunday, 
Veronica Villarroel from Chile sang his wife, Lina. She handles the 
part, which vocally reminds one of the mix of lyric and coloratura 
in ``La Traviata,'' with graceful expertise. 
</P>
<P>
	Denyce Graves, who has sung the earthy gypsy to Domingo's  
obsessed Don Jose many times, again was heard in the title role of 
``Carmen.'' Patricia Racette was a fuller-voiced Micaela than the 
usual pale depiction of Jose's village sweetheart, and Greer 
Grimsley focused his voice to a point as fine as his bullfighter's 
sword as Escamillo. Graves, a fearless spitfire, and Domingo, 
driven beyond reason, made her death scene as chillingly dramatic 
as though they were playing it for real. 
</P>
<P>
	After Sunday's performance, Domingo served as host for a party  
at the Met for the gala's staff and artists.

<HEADLINE> PBS Kids Channel To Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- PBS plans to boost spending on  
children's television, with some money devoted to a 24-hour PBS 
Kids Channel. 
</P>
<P>
	The channel scheduled to begin broadcasting in September will  
include such shows as ``Barney &AMP; Friends'' and ``Teletubbies,'' PBS 
President Ervin Duggan told the Television Critics Association on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of 1999, about a third of the country will be able to  
receive the channel through PBS stations with digital capability, 
Duggan said. 
</P>
<P>
	How many viewers see it will depend on how many invest in costly  
digital TV sets. Duggan acknowledged that the initial audience will 
be small. 
</P>
<P>
	The channel is part of a children's initiative that will include  
new preschool programs, an expansion of the PBS Kids Web site and 
an increase in PBS's free book distribution program, Duggan said. 
</P>
<P>
	PBS expects to spend substantially more on children's  
programming and services next year. The budget for 1999 is $27 
million; the proposed budget for 2000 is $40 million, PBS spokesman 
Tom Epstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	Over three years, the planned investment is about $125 million,  
said Kathy Quattrone, executive vice president of PBS Programming 
Services.

<HEADLINE>  GOP Tempers Clinton Criticisms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans accused President Clinton of  
proposing too much spending and too few tax cuts but generally held 
their fire on a State of the Union address framed against the 
partisan divisions of the impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats stood by their president, but some liberals expressed  
concerns about new defense spending and a prosperous nation's 
inattention to the plight of the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, studiously polite during past Clinton State of the  
Union speeches, were noticeably more distant this year, mostly 
keeping their applause short and unenthusiastic. Two House leaders 
who have been strong critics of Clinton, Majority Leader Dick 
Armey, R-Texas, and Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, sat stiffly in their 
seats and did not clap. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an opportunity, the Congress and the White House,  
working together, ... to have an agenda that we can advance that 
the American people will really approve of,'' said Senate Majority 
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., sounding the theme that the trial need 
not impede cooperation in passing legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The political paradox,'' said House Banking Committee Chairman  
Jim Leach, R-Iowa, ``is that the president's personal problems with 
Congress are likely to cause a redoubled effort at both ends of 
Pennsylvania Avenue to develop a constructive legislative 
relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., attending his first State of the  
Union as House speaker, said Clinton ``gave another good speech 
under difficult circumstances.'' But he said the president fell 
short in not proposing a comprehensive tax cut, not devoting enough 
attention to national security and not shifting more education 
programs to local control. 
</P>
<P>
	House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas,  
stressed that Republicans, who are seeking a 10 percent 
across-the-board tax rate cut, were dissatisfied with Clinton's 
plans to spend more and offer only limited tax cuts. ``Instead of 
using the surplus to retire the debt or return it to the American 
people through lower taxes, the president is proposing to spend it 
all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri said Clinton's  
speech, in which he introduced a far-reaching plan to protect 
Social Security and urged spending in numerous other programs in 
child care, education and crime-fighting, was his most vigorous 
since his first address to Congress six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has put forward an historic and aggressive set of  
initiatives, taking a giant leap towards addressing Americans' 
concerns as we approach a new century,'' Gephardt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Martin Frost of Texas, chairman of the House Democratic  
Caucus, said the president, with his ``bold agenda,'' ``did the 
country and the Congress a service tonight by moving our focus away 
from partisan politics and personal attacks and toward common-sense 
proposals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the liberal wing of the party also expressed concerns about  
some aspects of the agenda. Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., questioned 
Clinton's plan to spend more on defense, saying: ``We are locked 
into a perpetual arms race with ourselves'' that deprives social 
programs of needed funding. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Earl Hilliard, D-Ala., stressed that amid all the talk of  
prosperity, ``the people living on the streets of America and 
huddling in the shelters of our cities are our neighbors and our 
fellow citizens, and we must end their poverty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several lawmakers stayed away from the speech to protest  
Clinton's appearance before Congress at the same time the Senate is 
weighing his future in office. ``It's incredibly inappropriate for 
the House to actually offer the invitation. Didn't we just impeach 
the guy?'' asked Republican freshman Rep. Tom Tancredo of Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Others said the Lewinsky scandal would inevitably affect  
Clinton's ability to carry through on his goals. Sen. Dick Lugar, 
R-Ind., predicted bipartisan efforts in such areas as Social 
Security, health care, education and law enforcement, but said 
``progress this year may depend largely on working around corrosive 
effects of the White House predicament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Steve Largent, R-Okla., who joined Rep. Jennifer Dunn,  
R-Wash., in delivering the official Republican response to the 
speech, spoke of the need for reconciliation in national divisions 
that affect racial and family relationships as well as the 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reconciliation requires the humility and courage to say 'I am  
sorry, I was wrong will you forgive me?' Therein lies the healing 
salve for the wounded soul of our nation,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Banker Hails Latin Nations on Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- World Bank President James Wolfensohn said  
that today Latin American countries are dealing effectively with 
the continuing financial crisis in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that while the region ``was not ready for everything, it  
was more ready to be challenged than previously'' because of 
adjustments it made in fiscal and monetary policies after Mexico's 
1995 peso crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way the region has gone through the Brazilian crisis is  
rather optimistic,'' Wolfensohn said in a talk at the Organization 
of American States. 
</P>
<P>
	He praised Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso and  
Finance Minister Pedro Malan for their strong response to the 
economic crisis that started last week with a new speculative 
attack on the country's currency, the real. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people doing the job are on top of the situation and are  
doing everything possible,'' Wolfensohn said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said policies the International Monetary Fund is recommending  
to Brazil to prevent inflation from mounting by keeping interest 
rates high appear to be sensible. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said he did not think the IMF ``in its wildest  
expectations is talking about maintaining high interest rates. They 
are just trying to stabilize'' markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Enrique Iglesias, president of the Inter-American Development  
Bank, urged Latin American countries to resist the temptation to 
adopt protectionist measures because they could hinder integration 
of the region's economies.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton offered proposals Tuesday to  
bolster Americans' safety against terrorism at home and instability 
abroad, including big increases in defense spending and assistance 
to Russia to help reduce its weapons arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
	He urged Congress to help him ``pursue peace, fight terrorism,  
increase our strength and renew our alliances ... to build a 
stronger 21st century America in a freer, more peaceful world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton focused primarily on domestic affairs in his State of  
the Union address. But he spent about one-fourth of the speech on 
foreign policy and defense issues. 
</P>
<P>
	He criticized Cuba, China, Iraq and Serbia on human rights, and  
close ally Japan for its surging steel exports. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton called for a $12 billion increase in defense spending --  
part of a plan to add $110 billion over six years. Republicans 
quickly endorsed plans for more military spending, but other 
foreign affairs proposals were expected to find a mixed reaction in 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	On the economic front, Clinton urged a new round of world trade  
negotiations, hoping to counter protectionist forces set loose by 
current financial turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must tear down barriers, open markets and expand trade,''  
he said. At the same time, he warned Japan that if its steel 
exports ``are not reversed, America will respond.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president's plan for assistance to Russia would add to the  
Nunn-Lugar program aimed at dismantling nuclear weapons. He said it 
would increase funding by nearly two-thirds over five years to help 
redirect the work of Russian scientists from weapons research to 
peacetime pursuits. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also asked for increased support for U.S. diplomacy  
around the world and called again for payment of overdue U.N. dues. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, in their response to the speech, endorsed increased  
military spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president has signaled that he is ready to join us in  
strengthening our national defense,'' said Republican Rep. Steve 
Largent of Oklahoma, who also called for new missile defense system 
to protect the United States -- a proposal Clinton did not address. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's speech set the stage for a far-reaching NATO  
summit in Washington later this year, which is expected to attract 
heads of states from more than 44 countries for the formal 
admission of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic into the 
alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must support security in Europe and Asia,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Addressing China, Clinton said, ``Stability can no longer be  
bought at the expense of liberty.'' But he warned that China must 
not be isolated. 
</P>
<P>
	On Iraq, he said America will ``continue to contain Saddam -- and  
will work for the day when Iraq has a government worthy of its 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He offered no new initiative on the violence in Kosovo but said  
the United States and its NATO allies ``are pressing the Serbian 
government to stop its brutal repression'' in the Serb province. 
</P>
<P>
	He scored Cuba as the only non-democratic government in the  
Western Hemisphere and said, ``We are determined that Cuba, too, 
will know the blessings of liberty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also pledged to increase efforts to restrain the spread  
of nuclear weapons in North Korea, India and Pakistan and urged 
Congress to continue to provide funds for Mideast peace and to 
support the transition to democracy ``now beginning to take hold in 
Nigeria.''

<HEADLINE> Pfizer Beats Wall Street Estimates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Viagra sales regained their vigor in the fourth  
quarter, helping Pfizer Inc. on Tuesday beat Wall Street earnings 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding one-time items, Pfizer earned $711 million in the  
quarter, a 42 percent increase over the same period last year. 
Earnings per diluted share were 54 cents, beating analysts' 
estimates by 2 cents, according to First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	Net profit rose 14 percent to $634 million, or 49 cents per  
share. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer's total sales for the fourth quarter of 1998 were $3.87  
billion, an increase of 26 percent over the fourth quarter of 1997. 
Excluding the negative effect of foreign exchange, total revenues 
increased by 28 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher sales of Viagra, the anti-impotence pill, were driven by  
the drug's introduction in Europe and South America in the fourth 
quarter. Perhaps more significantly, U.S. Viagra sales also jumped 
10 percent to $131 million in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Viagra sales were $236 million in the fourth quarter,  
still far below the $411 million in the second quarter when the 
drug was approved for use in the United States, but considerably 
higher than the $141 million in sales in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Viagra, the fastest-selling new drug in pharmaceutical history,  
hit a slowdown last summer after concerns about dangerous side 
effects grew and several large health insurers decided not to cover 
the pill. Though analysts once predicted at least $1 billion in 
Viagra sales for last year, most said the $788 million in 1998 
Viagra sales that Pfizer posted still met or exceeded their latest 
projections. 
</P>
<P>
	About 200,000 U.S. doctors have written more than 7 million  
prescriptions for 3 million patients. Viagra is now available in 40 
countries worldwide, though Pfizer is awaiting permission to sell 
it in Japan, the second-largest pharmaceutical market in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pfizer is very strong across the board,'' said David Saks, an  
analyst with Gruntal &AMP; Co. He stressed the company has several 
strong drugs, and is not reliant merely on Viagra. Indeed, Viagra 
is Pfizer's fifth best-selling drug, though easily the most 
recognized. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer had three drugs bring in more than $1 billion in sales in  
1998: Norvasc, a high blood pressure and angina medication; Zoloft, 
for depression; and Zithromax, an antibiotic. 
</P>
<P>
	Diflucan, a drug for yeast infection, reached $916 million in  
sales last year. All four of the drugs saw double-digit growth in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on these numbers, Pfizer is poised to have a superior  
1999,'' said Hemant Shah, a drug industry analyst with HKS &AMP; Co. in 
Warren, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Pfizer closed at $115.87 1/2, down 6 1/4 cents in trading on  
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	For the full year, Pfizer's total sales were $13.54 billion, a  
23 percent increase over 1997. Profit for 1998 was $2.63 billion, a 
27 percent increase over 1997.

<HEADLINE> 14 Players Settle Arbitration Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Andy Pettitte and 13 other players don't have to  
worry about salary arbitration anymore this winter, agreeing to 
contracts Tuesday just before teams and players exchanged numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	Pettitte agreed to a $5.95 million, one-year contract, up from  
$3.8 million last year, and has the chance to earn $50,000 more in 
bonuses: $25,000 for pitching 200 innings and $25,000 for making 
the AL All-Star team. 
</P>
<P>
	Pettitte, a 26-year-old left-hander, was 16-11 with a 4.24 ERA  
in 1998, struggling with his control and mechanics for much of the 
season. He came up big in the World Series, pitching 7 1-3 shutout 
innings to win Game 4 as the Yankees completed their sweep of San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad. I like Pettitte,'' Yankees owner George Steinbrenner  
said at the NHL game between Buffalo and Tampa Bay. ``I didn't want 
any troubles with him. Nobody did, because we really like him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Pettitte, Houston right-hander Jay Powell got a  
$3.65 million, three-year contract and seven right-handed pitchers 
agreed to one-year deals: Montreal's Dustin Hermanson ($2.05 
million), James Baldwin of the Chicago White Sox ($1.9 million), 
the Dodgers' Darren Dreifort ($1.9 million), Houston's Sean Bergman 
($1,875,000), Anaheim's Steve Sparks ($1.35 million), Detroit's 
Bryce Florie ($1.3 million) and Oakland's T.J. Mathews ($750,000). 
</P>
<P>
	Also agreeing to one-year contracts were Cubs infielder Jose  
Hernandez ($2.4 million) and catcher Tyler Houston ($715,000); 
Philadelphia left-hander Paul Spoljaric ($750,000); Texas catcher 
Gregg Zaun ($425,000); and Tampa Bay left-hander Terrell Wade 
($250,000) 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the New York Mets had a tentative deal with  
right-hander Jason Isringhausen. 
</P>
<P>
	Among free agents, the Mets agreed to a $750,000, one-year  
contract with left-hander Allen Watson, Minnesota agreed to a minor 
league contract with right-hander Bob Wells and Toronto agreed to a 
minor league contract with right-hander Vincente Palacios.

<HEADLINE> States Push Fund for Tobacco Farms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) -- Faced with shrinking quotas, falling  
demand and several legal questions, tobacco state governors will go 
after money from cigarette manufacturers this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Six governors issued a joint statement Monday saying that a  
$5.15 billion trust fund to be financed by cigarette companies is 
``the only viable course of action to ensure the protection of our 
farmers and their future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The governors, attorneys general and agriculture commissioners  
of tobacco states are scheduled to meet with cigarette company 
officials Wednesday in Durham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``While there has been a strong sentiment for guaranteed  
purchases, the potential legal issues associated with this course 
of action may be considerable and would be time-consuming to 
resolve,'' the governors said in the statement. ``The dramatic 
reduction in the intent to purchase tobacco for the 1999 crop 
requires immediate and substantial action to avert financial 
disaster as the 1999 crop comes to market next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The statement was issued by Govs. Jim Hunt of North Carolina,  
Paul Patton of Kentucky, Jim Gilmore of Virginia, Jim Hodges of 
South Carolina, Roy Barnes of Georgia and Don Sundquist of 
Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We urge the companies to do the right thing by establishing  
this $5.15 billion trust fund to compensate them for part of their 
losses,'' the governors' statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The negotiations grow out of the $206 billion national tobacco  
settlement, in which the companies agreed to settle suits over 
smoking-related health care costs incurred by the states. The 
settlement stipulated that the companies meet with political 
leaders of tobacco states to talk about the concerns of the 
growers, who were not included in the deal. A first meeting was 
held a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
	But state and farm leaders acknowledge they have none of the  
legal leverage to get concessions for farmers that states did in 
seeking reimbursement for Medicaid and other health costs. 
</P>
<P>
	One company, Philip Morris, already has said it will contribute  
to the trust fund. But the company also said future payments would 
depend on what is done by the other major tobacco companies -- R.J. 
Reynolds, Brown &AMP; Williamson and Lorillard. 
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds initially opposed the trust fund, saying a better way  
to help farmers was to promise to buy more American-grown tobacco. 
Last week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that 
cigarette makers plan to purchase 291 million pounds of burley 
tobacco in 1999, a 31 percent drop from a year ago. And flue-cured 
tobacco quotas are down about 30 percent from two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The national tobacco settlement has already produced huge  
increases in the price of cigarettes and is expected to further 
depress demand for farmers to continue their production.

<HEADLINE> Court Won't Revive Abortion Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today refused to revive a  
1994 defamation lawsuit that Operation Rescue and three of its 
leaders filed against Sen. Edward M. Kennedy for linking the 
anti-abortion group to murder and other violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices let stand rulings that immunized Kennedy, D-Mass.,  
and later the federal government, from being sued over his 
comments. 
</P>
<P>
	The rejected appeal said lower courts wrongly concluded that a  
federal law giving governmental employees such legal protection was 
intended to include members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit filed by Operation Rescue National, Randall Terry,  
Philip Lawler and Robert Jewitt stemmed from Kennedy's Nov. 15, 
1993, attendance at a fund-raising luncheon in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	At a post-luncheon news conference, Kennedy discussed a  
then-pending bill to give abortion clinics federal protection 
against the use or threat of violence, physical obstruction or 
destruction of property. Kennedy was the primary sponsor of the 
bill that became the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act of 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to a question, Kennedy said, ``People can have a  
difference on public policy issues, but when we have a national 
organization like Operation Rescue that has as a matter of national 
policy firebombing and even murder, that's unacceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The anti-abortion group known for sponsoring massive blockades  
at abortion clinics across the nation sued Kennedy in a 
Massachusetts state court, accusing him of defamation. 
</P>
<P>
	The group and the three leaders who sued ``have never advocated  
firebombing or murder as part of their opposition to abortion,'' 
their lawyers said. The lawsuit said Kennedy had falsely accused 
them of criminal conduct, and by doing so had hurt their 
reputations. 
</P>
<P>
	The state court case was transferred to a federal court and the  
federal government replaced Kennedy as the defendant. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1988 law, called the Westfall Act, amended the Federal Tort  
Claims Act to make such a transfer and substitution possible when 
federal employees are sued for acts taken within the scope of their 
official duties. The law also grants legal immunity to all 
``officers or employees'' of the federal government's three 
branches. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge relied on the 1988 law in throwing out the  
lawsuit, and the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the 
dismissal after agreeing that Congress intended to include its own 
members in the definition of ``officers and employees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Operation Rescue vs. U.S., 98-525.

<HEADLINE>  PGA Tour Rolling in the Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Two weeks gone, halfway home to a million.  
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, it took until the third week of February before  
anyone on the PGA Tour climbed past the $500,000 mark in season 
earnings. David Duval was the first, but only after two top-10 
finishes in California, a tie for 27th at Phoenix, then a win at 
Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Sluman just spent the first two weeks of the year in Hawaii  
and returned to the mainland with $531,050, thanks to a tie for 
13th in the season-opening Mercedes Championships and winning the 
Sony Open in Honolulu last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The good news for the PGA and its rich new world of golf is  
this: Sluman has not said anything about taking the rest of the 
year off. 
</P>
<P>
	At least not yet.  
</P>
<P>
	As the PGA embarks on a year in which total prize money is up 40  
percent to $132 million, one of the concerns is that more will mean 
less -- the more money a player makes, the less he is likely to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's conceivable,'' Duval said, ``that come the U.S. Open,  
there might be a player at $3.5 million if you win the right 
events. That's all great. He could say, `I'll take off and see 
y'all at the Tour Championship.' 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem with that is you're going to lose some competitive  
sharpness. And you might lose it for a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Mickelson can attest to that.  
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, he won at Pebble Beach and was runner-up in the  
Sprint International and World Series to move from 13th to second 
on the money list. Mickelson took the next six weeks off and 
returned in style -- he missed the cut at Las Vegas, missed the cut 
at Disney and finished 17th out of 30 players in the Tour 
Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Tim Finchem expects growing pains to come with the  
largest increase in total prize money since it tripled to about 
$450,000 the year after the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	At the root of the change are the three World Golf Championships  
events, which account for one-third of the $36 million in new 
money. Finchem's hope is that more players will play more 
tournaments, instead of taking corporate money for private outings 
or appearance money overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	``This level of prize money allows us to compete more  
effectively for the attention of our players,'' he said. ``Our 
focus is to have a system whereby the total number of tournament 
starts on average by the top 30 or top 50 players is as good or 
better than it was before. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that will happen.''  
</P>
<P>
	Tiger Woods already has suggested that he may drop a few  
tournaments to compensate for the Match Play Championship in late 
February and the Stroke Play Championship in November. 
</P>
<P>
	If Ernie Els wins Match Play and has $3 million by the end of  
the PGA Championship, will he have enough incentive to play until 
the last few weeks of the season? 
</P>
<P>
	Will Greg Norman play more tournaments to prepare for the five  
$5 million events and the four majors, or less to be fresh for 
them? 
</P>
<P>
	``Are we going to have a few growing pains? Probably,'' Mark  
O'Meara said. ``I think when you look at what's happened, the 
purses and stuff going up, you can sit there and say, `That's good, 
that's bad, that's this or that.' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's wonderful. It's a nice problem to have these $3  
million or $5 million events for players to compete at a very high 
level. If they play well, they're rewarded. In that aspect, I don't 
see the players going on strike sometime soon. I think they're 
going to be playing more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And there certainly will be more at stake than the size of the  
bank account, which was true even when first place didn't pay more 
than $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	To take chunks of time off during the summer could put some  
players in jeopardy of dropping in the Ryder Cup points standings. 
Voting for player of the year likely will come down to the wire, as 
will the battle for No. 1 on the money list. And winning the money 
list is still a priority for most players, whether it takes $2.6 
million or $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're going to keep up with David Duval, who's going to  
play 26 or 27 times, you better play,'' Finchem said. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval is only in his fifth year on tour, but he understands the  
importance of a good schedule -- not so much how many tournaments, 
but building a routine and sticking with it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The money isn't something you think about when you're  
playing,'' Duval said. ``But it's awfully nice when you're done.''

<HEADLINE> Super Letdown for Vikings' Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- Another year, another heartache in  
Minnesota. Only this might be the biggest one of all. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings' shocking loss to Atlanta in the NFC championship  
game stung the organization at least as deeply as any 
disappointment in its first 37 seasons, including those four Super 
Bowl losses in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	It has been 22 years since the last of those Super setbacks, and  
this team was the one that was supposed to make up for those years 
of frustration. Instead, it just tossed another one on the pile. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to swallow, more than anything else,'' defensive end  
Derrick Alexander said Monday as the Vikings packed up their 
belongings in a somber locker room. ``The expectations for the 
entire team were to go so far and do so many great things, and to 
fall short of that is very disappointing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday afternoon's crushing 30-27 overtime loss at home to the  
Falcons led to a near-sleepless night for many of the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	Nose tackle Jerry Ball spent much of night staring out the  
window of his downtown Minneapolis hotel room as a heavy, wet snow 
fell on the city, wondering what went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Anderson barely slept after missing a 38-yard field goal --  
his first miss in more than a year -- that could have clinched the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Randall Cunningham was up until 4 a.m. after leading the  
highest-scoring offense in NFL history to just seven points after 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point in time, it's just such an abrupt stoppage, you  
can't think clearly,'' tight end Andrew Glover said. ``It was hard 
to sleep, it's hard to really believe it was happening. It all 
seemed like a dream, a bad dream at that. But it's reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't supposed to end like this, not this soon.  
</P>
<P>
	No defense was supposed to be able to stop Minnesota's explosive  
offense. Atlanta did after falling behind 20-7 late in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	No offense was supposed to be able to function properly in the  
din of a Metrodome filled with 64,060 wild fans, the largest crowd 
ever to see a playoff game in Minnesota. The Falcons did. 
</P>
<P>
	No team was supposed to keep the Vikings from a Jan. 31 date in  
Miami with the AFC champions. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're going to keep replaying plays that you could have made  
and situations. And it's gone,'' said safety Robert Griffith, who 
dropped a diving interception attempt on the play before Atlanta's 
tying touchdown with 49 seconds left in regulation. ``That's just 
the way we're built. There's nothing we can do about it now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After going 11 years without even reaching the conference title  
game, the Vikings felt they had assembled a team capable of winning 
their first Super Bowl. Their 15-1 regular-season record and 
NFL-record 556 points seemed to prove they were right. 
</P>
<P>
	They routed Arizona -- just business as usual -- in the divisional  
playoffs and then jumped to a 13-point lead late in the first half 
Sunday. The lead still was 10 with just over 13 minutes remaining 
in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami seemed just a plane ride away.  
</P>
<P>
	``You get to the championship game and you really feel you're on  
your way to the Super Bowl and it ends the way it did, so abruptly, 
it's the most devastating emotional thing you have to deal with as 
a coach,'' said offensive coordinator Brian Billick, who flew to 
Baltimore on Monday to interview for a head coaching job.

	The day perhaps was hardest for Anderson, the 17-year veteran  
who never has been to a Super Bowl despite four trips to the 
conference final (two with Pittsburgh and last season with San 
Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson had kicked 46 consecutive field goals when he lined up  
for a 38-yarder late in the fourth quarter. He had made all 106 of 
his kicks this season, including extra points.

	Tears welled in Anderson's eyes Monday as he recalled meeting  
his 9-year-old son, Austin, after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first I saw him he came over and gave me a big hug and  
reminded me of one of the lessons that I try to teach him all the 
time,'' Anderson said. ``He said, `Well, Dad. You tell me all the 
time you can't make 'em all.' It was a hard way to learn that 
lesson myself. 
</P>
<P>
	``That certainly hit home.''

<HEADLINE> White House Opens Clinton Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- White House Counsel Charles Ruff told the  
Senate impeachment trial today that President Clinton was innocent 
of the charges lodged against him and ``must not be removed from 
office.'' He opened Clinton's defense by attacking the House 
prosecutors' case as a ``witches' brew of charges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff, an imposing figure in Washington legal circles for two  
decades, sharply attacked the conclusions and motives of the 13 
House prosecutors who laid out their evidence last week. He called 
their effort ``nothing more than a rush to judgment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House Republicans who approved two article of impeachment  
alleging Clinton lied under oath and obstructed justice in 
concealing his affair with Monica Lewinsky were ``convinced by 
their own rhetoric'' and failed to ``explore the constitutional 
underpinnings of that duty,'' Ruff argued in a calm, matter-of-fact 
presentation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps they understood that a full and candid exploration  
would reveal that the proposed articles had no constitutional 
underpinnings at all,'' he said in the sharpest attack yet on the 
Republicans' work. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have, in essence, treated these articles as empty vessels  
to be filled with some witches' brew of charges,'' Ruff said. 
</P>
<P>
	The House prosecutors defended their presentation afterward,  
issuing a statement disputing Ruff's contention they had ``only 
alleged'' Clinton committed perjury and had not proven it. The 
statement listed four specific Clinton statements they said were 
``the president's perjurious statements'' to the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff gave an unyielding defense of the president just hours  
before Clinton was to deliver the State of the Union Address before 
the same lawmakers that impeached him. 
</P>
<P>
	In a dramatic conclusion, Ruff pointedly contested House  
Judiciary Committee chairman Henry Hyde's emotional appeal on 
Saturday that the war heroes of the past would be dishonored if 
Clinton were allowed to remain in office. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do know this, my father was on Omaha beach 55 years ago. And  
I know how he would feel if here today,'' Ruff said, his voice 
choking. ``He didn't fight, no one fought for one side of this case 
or the other. He fought as all those did, for our country and our 
Constitution. And as long as each of us -- manager, president's 
counsel, senator -- does his or her constitutional duty, those who 
fought for their country will be proud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Ruff said as he glanced toward the table where the  
House prosecutors sat, ``There is not a court anywhere, highest to 
lowest, that would hesitate, if they were confronted with an 
indictment written like these articles, to throw it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``William Jefferson Clinton is not guilty of the charges,'' he  
declared. ``He did not commit perjury. He did not obstruct justice. 
He must not be removed from office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Delving into the evidence used to charge Clinton with perjury,  
Ruff dismissed discrepancies between the sworn accounts of Ms. 
Lewinsky and the president. He said the Supreme Court has ruled 
that a perjury conviction cannot be sustained with ``equally honest 
witnesses who may well have different recollections of the same 
events.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also challenged prosecutors' assertion that Clinton tried to  
obstruct justice when his secretary collected gifts the president 
had given to Ms. Lewinsky and that were under subpoena. Ruff noted 
there were no witnesses who testified Clinton instructed the 
secretary to do so and said the Republicans' conclusion was based 
``not on any pillars of obstruction but on shifting sand castles of 
speculation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House abandoned a plan to add some congressional  
Democrats to its defense presentation on the Senate floor to 
bolster arguments that his impeachment was handled in a ``very 
partisan way.'' Officials said they backed off after some Senate 
Democrats raised concerns about the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity,  
said the White House had been interested in having Reps. John 
Conyers of Michigan, Rick Boucher of Virginia and Tom Barrett of 
Wisconsin make presentations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate's Republican leader rejected Democratic suggestions  
that calling witnesses later in the trial would turn the proceeding 
into a lurid show. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it should lead to an unseemly spectacle. You  
don't have to get into the details,'' said Majority Leader Trent 
Lott. He said he hadn't made a final decision on recommending 
witnesses, calling it ``premature'' to do so before the White House 
made its opening arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff, who works from a wheelchair, sat in the well of the Senate  
with a glass of water, plain sheet of paper and a book at his side 
and a microphone clipped to his lapel. He kept the rapt attention 
of senators -- Lott, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch 
and House prosecutor Asa Hutchinson were among those who took 
copious notes. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the onlookers in nearly full Senate galleries were actress  
Whoopi Goldberg and actor Frank Langella. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff, the last of the Watergate prosecutors, read comments made  
by Republicans in 1974 when the removal of Richard Nixon from 
office was weighed. He argued that even if the offenses against 
Clinton were proven, they would not meet the standard intended by 
the Founding Fathers for removing a president for high crimes and 
misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The framers set an extraordinarily high level,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The chief White House lawyer also took aim at the woman whose  
secret recordings prompted the crisis. He said Linda Tripp ``was 
able to play'' an ``oddly multifaceted role'' to assist both Paula 
Jones' lawyers and Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's 
investigation at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	He questioned why Starr had not prevented Mrs. Tripp, a  
cooperating witness in his investigation, from aiding the Jones 
lawyers. Starr's office ``inexplicably chose not to,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	This will be the second year that Clinton's State of the Union  
address has been clouded by charges of marital infidelities. He 
presented his 1998 speech a few days after the Lewinsky story was 
made public. 
</P>
<P>
	At his trial, meanwhile, the switch from not discussing the  
facts to disputing many of them could bolster Republican demands 
for witnesses to help resolve the disputes. The White House has 
been fighting that prospect but now expects witnesses, officials 
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- White House Counsel Charles Ruff told senators  
today that President Clinton was innocent of the charges lodged 
against him and ``must not be removed from office.'' Opening 
Clinton's impeachment defense, he also attacked the motives and 
tactics of the president's accusers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff, an imposing figure in Washington legal circles for two  
decades, challenged the evidence laid out against Clinton by 13 
Republican House prosecutors last week. ``What you have before you 
is the product of nothing more than a rush to judgment,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``William Jefferson Clinton is not guilty of the charges,'' Ruff  
argued as the trial resumed after a two-day recess. ``He did not 
commit perjury. He did not obstruct justice. He must not be removed 
from office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Changing tactics from earlier strategies in which the White  
House shied away from attacking key accusers of Clinton, Ruff took 
aim at the woman whose secret recordings prompted the crisis. He 
said Linda Tripp ``was able to play this oddly multifaceted role'' 
to assist both Paula Jones' lawyers and Starr's investigation at 
the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	He questioned why Starr had not prevented Mrs. Tripp, a  
cooperating witness in his investigation, from aiding the Jones 
lawyers. Starr ``inexplicably chose not to,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As he began, Ruff said the White House welcomed the opportunity  
to prove Clinton's innocence. ``Some have suggested that we have 
feared to do so. We do not,'' he declared. 
</P>
<P>
	The opening of Clinton's defense came on an extraordinary day in  
which Clinton was also delivering the State of the Union address to 
a Congress that has impeached him. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff sat in the well of the Senate, holding a microphone in his  
hand and facing the 100 hushed senators who serve as jurors and 
judges in the first presidential impeachment trial in 131 years. 
After a brief introduction, Ruff plunged directly into the 
voluminous record of evidence relied on by House prosecutors to 
support the two articles of impeachment against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Tracking Clinton's troubles back to the Jones sexual harassment  
lawsuit, he attacked the motives of the Arkansas woman's lawyers in 
seeking to uncover evidence of other Clinton relationships. That 
effort led to the discovery of Monica Lewinsky and the president's 
illicit affair. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the evidence digging was done ``clearly with only one  
purpose: to embarrass the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just hours before the opening, the White House made a tactical  
shift and also added some congressional Democrats to the defense 
team to bolster arguments that his impeachment was handled in a 
``very partisan way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the Senate's Republican leader rejected  
Democratic suggestions that calling witnesses would turn the trial 
into a lurid show. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it should lead to an unseemly spectacle. You  
don't have to get into the details,'' said Majority Leader Trent 
Lott. He said he hadn't made a final decision on recommending 
witnesses, calling it ``premature'' to do so before the White House 
made its opening arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said today that some  
Democratic members of the House Judiciary Committee will join 
Clinton's defense team, along with former Sen. Dale Bumpers of 
Arkansas, a longtime ally of the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart declined to name the House Democrats or say how many  
are involved. He said they were joining the team to ``offer some 
valuable insight into how we got to this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity,  
said the White House was interested in having Reps. John Conyers of 
Michigan, Rick Boucher of Virginia and Tom Barrett of Wisconsin 
join the team. But Boucher declined the invitation, citing schedule 
conflicts. The lawmakers would speak before the Senate as part of 
the president's defense. 
</P>
<P>
	All three are members of the Judiciary Committee, where  
Democrats battled Republicans to the end in opposition to the 
articles of impeachment that eventually cleared the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said the lawmakers would make presentations during the  
opening arguments to explain how the impeachment effort ``moved 
forward in a very partisan way, and in a way that was not fair to 
the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House team also was to focus on conflicts in testimony  
gathered by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, a shift in strategy 
aimed at undercutting House charges of perjury and obstruction of 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
	This will be the second year that Clinton's State of the Union  
address has been clouded by charges of marital infidelities. He 
presented his 1998 speech a few days after the Lewinsky story was 
made public. 
</P>
<P>
	At his trial, meanwhile, the switch from not discussing the  
facts to disputing many of them could bolster Republican demands 
for witnesses to help resolve the disputes. The White House has 
been fighting that prospect but now expects witnesses, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, John Podesta, the White House chief of staff, said  
today there is no assurance that witnesses could resolve whatever 
conflicts might exist in testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think after our defense team has put down the case on the  
facts, the law and the Constitution, have reminded the senators 
there are 60,000 pages of testimony from over 100 witnesses that 
are before them already, they may find there is no need for 
witnesses,'' Podesta said on NBC's ``Today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Clinton's lawyers conclude their arguments, he said, they  
will move to dismiss the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle said Monday that witnesses  
might be inevitable. In an interview with The Associated Press, the 
South Dakota Democrat said witnesses could lead to the spectacle of 
100 senators watching former Ms. Lewinsky, the former White House 
intern, ``point to where the president touched her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., dismissed Daschle's warning as  
``all-or-nothing'' scare tactics that are ``just not true.'' Lott 
seconded Kyl's opinion.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes Social Security Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton wants to use more than 60  
percent of any budget surpluses to shore up Social Security and 
ensure the retirement system can pay promised benefits. He also 
would create separate 401(k)-style accounts for most working 
Americans, and for the first time invest some of the system's cash 
in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	``I propose that we make the historic decision to invest the  
surplus to save Social Security,'' Clinton said Tuesday in his 
State of the Union address. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's proposal to have the government invest some  
Social Security money on Wall Street immediately generated 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, no. A thousand times no,'' said House Ways and Means  
Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas. ``It will open the doors 
to all kinds of mischief involving government dictates, favoritism 
and cronyism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, the overall plan was judged by Clinton to be most  
likely to satisfy both Democrats and Republicans, aides say. 
</P>
<P>
	``It protects the traditional guaranteed benefit of Social  
Security ... while giving all Americans the ability to participate 
in wealth creation and added savings,'' said presidential adviser 
Gene Sperling. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals, included in his State of the Union address, are  
part of Clinton's blueprint for using about $4.4 trillion in 
government surpluses now expected over the next 15 years. In the 
speech, he proposed adding about 60 percent -- which his aides 
clarified as closer to 62 percent -- directly to Social Security's 
cash reserves. Another 11 percent would go to the new retirement 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 15 percent would be earmarked for Medicare, the health  
insurance program for the elderly and disabled that, like Social 
Security, is expected to be financially burdened by the nation's 
huge, aging baby boom generation. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton proposed that the remaining $500 billion or so in  
surpluses go to military and other domestic programs, angering many 
Republicans who want an across-the-board income tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wants to spend a lot more money; he wants government to  
grow,'' said Assistant Senate Majority Leader Don Nickles of 
Oklahoma. ``If we're going to have a surplus, we think that 
taxpayers should be the primary beneficiaries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Republicans have made reforming the nation's retirement  
system a priority too this year, with party leaders even offering 
to introduce legislation Clinton recommends. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a commitment to work together in a bipartisan way to  
come to an agreement,'' said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, 
R-Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials estimate the cash infusions Clinton is  
proposing will keep Social Security financially sound until 2055 -- 
more than 20 years longer than now expected. Medicare's crisis date 
would be postponed from 2008 to 2020. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the White House still plans to pursue negotiations with  
lawmakers on additional structural changes. Among the 
administration's goals will be 75 worry-free years for each 
program, which could require controversial changes such as a higher 
retirement age. 
</P>
<P>
	Other priorities Clinton outlined include:  
</P>
<P>
	--Lifting penalties that now mean smaller Social Security checks  
for senior citizens who continue to work. Aides said the penalties 
would probably be phased out slowly, but beginning soon. 
</P>
<P>
	--Adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare.  
</P>
<P>
	--Providing extra financial help to single elderly women, now the  
poorest retirees. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton first pressed lawmakers in his State of the Union  
address a year ago to save budget surpluses for Social Security. 
But until now, he has frustrated Republican lawmakers by managing 
to thwart their plans to use surpluses for a tax cut without 
endorsing any specific Social Security plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Clinton's proposal, the biggest portion of the expected  
surplus would be added to Social Security's cash reserves. Out of 
that, he is suggesting about a quarter be invested, in bulk, in the 
stock market in hopes of increasing its value. 
</P>
<P>
	The remainder of the surplus going to Social Security would be  
kept -- as the program's cash reserves have been traditionally -- in 
safer, but historically lower-yielding, U.S. Treasury bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Republicans strongly disapprove of government participation  
in private financial markets, preferring to see Social Security 
money diverted into personal accounts that Americans would control. 
But Clinton has sided with Democrats who say that would expose 
individuals to too much financial risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will ask lawmakers to help devise a way that bulk  
investment decisions could be made by an independent board, 
insulated from politics and limited to relatively neutral options 
such as stock index funds. 
</P>
<P>
	But the president also is joining influential Republicans who  
propose starting new personal retirement accounts using budget 
surpluses, not Social Security money. 
</P>
<P>
	The accounts would work something like the 401(k) plans many  
companies offer, allowing workers to choose from investment options 
such as stock and bond funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's version -- dubbed Universal Savings Accounts -- would  
give people an annual lump sum from the government, then additional 
contributions paralleling their own savings up to a limit. A 
sliding scale would mean bigger subsidies for those with lower 
incomes and might disqualify the wealthiest -- perhaps 5 percent -- 
from the money altogether.

<HEADLINE> Senators Unveil Congress Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate leaders of both parties introduced  
dueling agendas today dealing with taxes, schools and crime as the 
new 106th Congress returned in force to the Capitol and began 
burrowing into its legislative tasks. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither party, however, offered proposals for what is expected  
to be one of the year's top issues: How to shore up the politically 
sensitive Social Security program for the baby boomers' looming 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats simply said federal surpluses should be untouched  
until a Social Security fix is implemented. Senate Republicans, 
like their House counterparts, set aside their first bill -- S.1 -- 
for a Social Security plan from President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got to show us the specifics,'' said Senate Majority  
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as Republicans announced their strategy, White House  
officials caught them off guard by revealing that Clinton would 
propose keeping much of the projected federal surpluses in Social 
Security's trust fund, but investing some of it in the stock 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Republicans' other top four bills would give communities  
more power over schools and limit federal controls; cut income 
taxes by 10 percent across the board; boost military salaries and 
pensions; and increase anti-drug efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement by each party of its first five bills of the  
new Congress is a biennial ritual that each uses to publicize its 
top priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats' top bills would expand the rights of patients of  
health maintenance organizations; beef up resources for hiring and 
training teachers; boost the minimum wage and cut taxes for many 
couples; move against crime and illegal drugs; and expand access to 
Medicare for many older Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	As they unveiled their measures, Democratic leaders blamed  
Republicans for killing similar initiatives last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American people are waiting for us to act,'' Senate  
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said on the Senate floor. 
``They've been waiting, frankly, too long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Legislative work will begin slowly as usual, with little but  
committee work going on this month. But with polls showing most 
members of the public disenchanted with GOP efforts to remove 
President Clinton from office, Republicans are especially 
interested in demonstrating that they are eager to address issues 
of concern to voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``A good message is the work moves forward,'' said Rep. Jennifer  
Dunn, R-Wash., in an interview Monday. Dunn and Rep. Steve Largent, 
R-Okla., will be delivering the GOP response tonight to Clinton's 
State of the Union address. 
</P>
<P>
	In the House, new Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said Monday he  
would reserve H.R.1, the House's first bill of the new Congress, 
for the president's legislation on strengthening the pension 
program for the elderly and disabled. Clinton has called for 
buttressing the program for the impending retirement of baby 
boomers, but has provided no details on how he would do it and is 
not expected to reveal any soon. 
</P>
<P>
	The flurry of activity comes as lawmakers return to the Capitol  
in full force, in time to hear Clinton's address tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	The House meets Tuesday, but mainly so members can be around for  
Clinton's address in the evening. It will then recess until Feb. 2, 
although many committees will remain at work. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate was meeting briefly this morning for speeches on  
legislation. After lunch, senators will resume their more familiar 
mode of late, hearing the Clinton impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Topping off what will unavoidably be a peculiar day, those same  
senators will then troop across the Capitol after dinner to hear 
the president's address. 
</P>
<P>
	The full Senate's legislative schedule is uncertain after that,  
mainly because of the unsure timing of the impeachment trial. It is 
possible that the Senate will meet for legislative business on 
Wednesday and Friday mornings, though little more than speeches are 
likely because no bills are ready for floor consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Appropriations Committee was planning almost daily  
hearings in preparation for its work later this year on spending 
bills for 2000. GOP leaders want to get those bills finished as 
early as possible, in hopes of avoiding a replay of last fall's 
mammoth $520 billion spending measure, which handed Clinton several 
victories just before the elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Other panels planning early hearings include the Senate Budget  
Committee, with 11 hearings on budget topics; the House Ways and 
Means Committee, at which Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan 
will testify on economic issues; the House's renamed Armed Services 
Committee, which will hear from the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and the 
Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, which will consider 
efforts to impose new controls on health-maintenance organizations.

<HEADLINE> NIH: Put Babies in Bed on Backs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Parents are being reminded to place babies on  
their back when they are put to bed to reduce the chance of sudden 
infant death syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development  
issued the reminder Tuesday, noting that traditionally there has 
been a higher incidence of sudden infant death in cold weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 3,000 babies each year fall victim to sudden, unexplained  
death in the first year of life. The causes of SIDS are unclear, 
and it is not currently possible to predict which infants may be 
affected. 
</P>
<P>
	But researchers said that since they launched the campaign to  
get parents to place babies on their backs there has been a 43 
percent reduction in sudden infant deaths.

<HEADLINE>  British Aerospace Buying Marconi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- British Aerospace PLC is acquiring General  
Electric Co. PLC's Marconi Electronics division for $12.7 billion 
in stock in a deal that creates a British defense group expected to 
rival the American defense giants. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase, announced today, will create the third-largest  
defense and aerospace group in the world after Boeing and Lockheed 
Martin in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined British Aerospace-Marconi defense and aerospace  
business is valued at $25.7 billion at current market prices. 
</P>
<P>
	British Aerospace chairman Sir Richard Evans told a news  
conference the deal ``represents an important step in the 
restructuring of the aerospace and defense industry in Europe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The merged company could be the ``one major player'' to speak  
for Britain in the looming reorganization of Europe's defense 
industry, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the decision disappointed European defense companies, which  
had hoped for a cross-border deal to create a powerful European 
group to rival the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's DaimlerChrysler Aerospace, also known as Dasa, had  
been expected until recently to merge with British Aerospace. In a 
statement, Dasa said the deal would make ``balanced European 
horizontal mergers such as Dasa-BAe impossible and create an 
obstacle to European integration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dasa said it will now consider mergers with other European or  
U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomson-CSF of France, which had wooed Marconi, said it  
disapproved of the merger plan. 
</P>
<P>
	But British Aerospace chief executive John Weston said there was  
``nothing in (today's) announcement that shuts any door'' to a deal 
with Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	He denied that BAe had paid too much for Marconi, but shares in  
both BAe and GEC fell Tuesday on the belief that it had, dealers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	At midday on the London exchange, shares in British Aerospace  
had dropped 11.3 percent while GEC shares were down 4.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, GEC shareholders will receive shares in New  
British Aerospace amounting to just under 37 percent of the 
enlarged business, and will retain their holdings in what is left 
of GEC, which is unrelated to the U.S. conglomerate General 
Electric Co. 
</P>
<P>
	British Aerospace shareholders will have about 63 percent of the  
new aerospace business. 
</P>
<P>
	GEC chief executive Lord Simpson said the merger was  
advantageous for shareholders, giving them a stake in the enlarged 
British Aerospace and a more focused GEC. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies said the merger will lead to annual cost savings  
of about $453.7 million within three years of the deal, probably 
around the end of 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The one-time cost of achieving the savings is about $330 million  
over that three year period. 
</P>
<P>
	British Aerospace and Marconi, which together employ some  
130,000 people worldwide, said the restructuring could result in a 
small number of lost jobs.

<HEADLINE> Loss Leaves Bitter Legacy for Vikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- All those points and all those  
records and all those wins don't mean much to the Minnesota Vikings 
now. For the time being, the only legacy they can see for 
themselves is failure. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota's NFC championship loss to Atlanta tarnished one of  
the most marvelous regular seasons the NFL has ever seen. It can't 
diminish the achievements, but it will make the good times hard to 
remember. 
</P>
<P>
	``In reality, (records) don't mean anything if you can't say  
that you're the best. That's my opinion,'' nose tackle Jerry Ball 
said. ``It's not to diminish or delete anything that has been 
accomplished. But in hindsight what has been accomplished? 
</P>
<P>
	``We know what our records were. We know that we did some good  
things and some great things. But winning it all when you have a 
chance is probably the most important thing in that hour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And once again, the Vikings -- the first NFL team to win 15  
regular season games without winning a Super Bowl -- have to wait 
another year for that chance. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 season started taking shape Tuesday, just two days  
after the overtime loss to Atlanta prevented Minnesota from ending 
its 22-year Super Bowl drought. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Billick, the offensive coordinator of a unit that led the  
Vikings to an NFL-record 556 points in 1998, took the coaching job 
in Baltimore. His most likely replacement is Ray Sherman, who left 
his job as Minnesota's quarterbacks coach last year for one rocky 
season as Pittsburgh's offensive coordinator. Sherman recently 
resigned from the Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, the Vikings named starting outside linebacker  
Dixon Edwards one of the five players eligible for the expansion 
draft. The move was not surprising, considering Edwards' mediocre 
performance and the two years left on his $10 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings will need that money to deal with a list of 15  
unrestricted free agents, including seven starters (six on defense) 
and versatile return specialist-third-down back David Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have to make a lot of decisions on this team,'' said  
quarterback Brad Johnson, who wants to be traded if the Vikings 
plan for him to remain a backup to Randall Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
	If last offseason's spending spree is a blueprint for how the  
Vikings will approach free agency, expect them to keep most of the 
key players from a team that matched the most regular season 
victories in NFL history. 
</P>
<P>
	Their top priorities are Pro Bowl middle linebacker Ed McDaniel,  
who will need surgery to repair a knee injured in Sunday's loss, 
second-team All-Pro strong safety Robert Griffith and Ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Other starters who will be free agents when that period begins  
next month are left cornerback Corey Fuller, defensive end Derrick 
Alexander, whose 7 1/2 sacks were second on the team, injury prone 
free safety Orlando Thomas and fullback Chuck Evans. 
</P>
<P>
	If all or most of those players remain in Minnesota, the Vikings  
will be Super Bowl contenders once again despite a rugged schedule 
that includes Atlanta, San Francisco, Denver, Dallas and the New 
York Giants, along with two games apiece against NFC Central rivals 
Green Bay and Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, they still will have that amazing offense.  
</P>
<P>
	Sparked by game-breaking receiver Randy Moss, the Vikings tied  
or broke dozens of NFL and team records. Moss set or tied 31 team 
and league marks on his own during one of the most impressive 
rookie seasons in NFL history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really care too much about what happened this season,  
the records and all,'' Moss said. ``I mean, the Super Bowl is 
something you dream of as a kid, and we had an opportunity to get 
there. ... I thought we were going to do it, and then we let it 
slip right out of our hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's still hard for the Vikings to accept.  
</P>
<P>
	As has become his custom, coach Dennis Green declined to speak  
to reporters after the season-ending loss. He met with the team for 
about 20 minutes Monday, and Johnson relayed the tone of his 
message. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tough situation on everybody,'' Johnson said. ``We  
didn't expect to be closing up shop like this. We expected to go to 
the Super Bowl, so you take this loss in a tough way. 
</P>
<P>
	``So it's really just to stay upbeat, stay positive and build  
for next year. Remember what we had this year, because it's a very 
special year and you may never get that chance again.''

<HEADLINE> IOC Has No Record of Samaranch Sword </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee has no record  
of the expensive samurai sword the Nagano bid committee says it 
gave IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	Nagano Gov. Goro Yoshimura, who chaired the committee that won  
the 1998 Winter Olympics, said Tuesday a sword reportedly worth 
about $13,000 was presented to Samaranch in person. 
</P>
<P>
	But IOC spokesman Theo Chapman said the sword was not found in  
the ``Samaranch Collection,'' which consists of art, Olympic 
torches and other gifts Samaranch has received through the years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have any record at the IOC that it exists,'' said  
Chapman, who would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said it has checked all its records, archives and the  
Olympic museum and cannot locate the sword. The IOC did say it had 
the Japanese paintings from Nagano that were offered. 
</P>
<P>
	The gifts Samaranch accepts on behalf of the entire committee  
are kept in an IOC storeroom in Lausanne, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese critics of the Olympics have long questioned the  
red-carpet treatment the Nagano bidders offered IOC officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said Monday its bribery investigation of Salt Lake  
City's wining bid for the 2002 Winter Games will be expanded to 
include recent bids by other cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Yoshimura said he was confident Nagano would turn up clean even  
if the IOC decides to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have never done anything wrong,'' he said. ``Even if there  
is an investigation, I believe there will be no problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The head of the Nagano organizers and the education minister,  
who oversees the Olympics, both said Tuesday they had no plans to 
investigate Nagano's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Makoto Kobayashi, the director general of the Nagano organizing  
committee, said he had no responsibility in what happened during 
the bid because that was ``totally separate'' from running the 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's so annoying. The sparks from Salt Lake are falling on  
Nagano,'' Kobayashi told The Associated Press in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nagano organizer took over after the bidding committee  
disbanded in 1991. The organizing committee is set to disband in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's education minister also dismissed the allegations of  
vote-buying as ``Nagano's problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no intention at this time to investigate,'' Akito  
Arima said. ``We have trusted the local communities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Nagano Mayor Tasuku Tsukada, a senior official of the  
bidding committee, acknowledged the bidders gave an IOC official, 
whom he did not identify, a painting worth thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC officials are not permitted to accept gifts of more than  
$150, but Samaranch has said the rule does not apply to him because 
he does not vote in the selection of host cities.

<HEADLINE>  British Aerospace Buying Marconi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- British Aerospace PLC is acquiring General  
Electric Co. PLC's Marconi Electronics division for $12.7 billion 
in stock in a deal that creates a British defense group expected to 
rival the American defense giants. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase, announced today, will create the third-largest  
defense and aerospace group in the world after Boeing and Lockheed 
Martin in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined British Aerospace-Marconi defense and aerospace  
business is valued at $25.7 billion at current market prices.

<HEADLINE> Marion Jones Wins Jesse Owens Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Marion Jones, who threatened Florence Griffith  
Joyner's world sprint records last year, is the winner of the 1999 
Jesse Owens International Trophy Award. 
</P>
<P>
	The sensational 23-year-old Jones, who won 36 of 37 finals last  
year, losing only her last competition, the long jump to Germany's 
Heike Drechsler, received 85 votes in balloting by an international 
panel of electors. 
</P>
<P>
	Cross country skier Bjorn Daehlie of Norway, winner of three  
gold medals and one silver at the 1998 Winter Olympics, finished 
second with 78 votes. Ethiopia's Haile Gebrselassie, who set world 
records at 5,000 and 10,000 meters last year and won the 1998 Jesse 
Owens Award, was third with 38 votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones' victories in the 100 and 200 meters at the World Cup in  
Johannesburg, South Africa in September made her the second-fastest 
ever at those distances, behind Griffith Joyner. Jones was timed in 
10.65 seconds for the 100 and 21.62 for the 200. Griffith Joyner's 
records are 10.49 and 21.34. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Jones also twice long-jumped 23 feet, 11 3/4 inches, the  
best mark in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	She is the first American to be ranked No. 1 in the world in  
three events in the same year. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones will be honored at a dinner Feb. 11 at the Waldorf-Astoria  
Hotel.

<HEADLINE> AOL Removes Online Thesaurus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DULLES, Va. (AP) -- America Online and the Merriam-Webster Inc.  
Web site have temporarily removed a thesaurus that included two 
slurs among synonyms for the word ``homosexual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The thesaurus is being reworked to remove all synonyms for  
``homosexual,'' including ``fruit'' and ``faggot,'' and to clarify 
symbols that indicate potentially offensive words. 
</P>
<P>
	Merriam-Webster and Dulles-based AOL, which licenses the  
thesaurus from Merriam-Webster, took the thesaurus offline Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Deborah Burns, Merriam-Webster's director of marketing, said the  
company decided Monday to remove all synonyms for ``homosexual'' to 
conform with a 25-year-old policy not to offer entries for racial 
or ethnic groups such as Jews, Hispanics or blacks, Ms. Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Along the way, we should have incorporated sexual groups into  
that same policy,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Merriam-Webster, a leading publisher of dictionaries and  
language reference books, is checking its Collegiate Thesaurus for 
other disparaging entries. 
</P>
<P>
	``But first, we're making an apology about this. We were in  
error in a couple of ways and we're glad someone has brought it to 
our attention,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gay rights groups learned of the words after a radio talk show  
host typed the word ``homosexual'' into AOL's thesaurus database on 
Thursday, saw the synonyms and e-mailed them to a friend at GAYBC 
Radio Network, an Internet-based audio news service. 
</P>
<P>
	The quick action by AOL, the world's largest online service, and  
Merriam-Webster pleased the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against 
Defamation. 
</P>
<P>
	GLAAD spokeswoman Cathy Renna said the group was not calling for  
the synonyms to be deleted, but that they be presented as 
derogatory and highly offensive. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not that they are words that people don't know and don't  
use, but in 1999, they are words that should be presented in some 
sort of context,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Burns said the online thesaurus included symbols that  
indicate such words have ``limited use,'' usually meaning they are 
derogatory, and that people should check the words in a dictionary 
before using them. But to find the key explaining the symbols, 
online users had to click through five additional pages. 
</P>
<P>
	When the thesaurus goes back online, she said, the key will  
appear on the same page with the synonyms. Similar changes will be 
made in the next printed version of the thesaurus.

<HEADLINE> Super Bowl May Be Bust for Miami </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Super Bowl may actually be a super bust for  
cities where the game is played. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Football League claims professional football's  
premier event generates more than $300 million for host 
communities. But a new study of sales data from six Super Bowls 
says that isn't the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The assumption that football fans add to the tourist base rather  
than replace it is mainly to blame, said Philip Porter, an 
economics professor at the University of South Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I have found is irrefutable. It's not based on an  
estimate or some projection,'' Porter said Monday. ``It's real 
data. I went back and looked at the sales. Nothing is more 
revealing than zero impact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Super Bowl makes its eighth trip to south Florida on Jan. 31  
at Pro Player Stadium, with the Denver Broncos playing the 
Minnesota Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL, its host committee and various tourist officials stand  
by the league's claim that the economic impact will be enormous. 
They say the game has a lasting impact beyond filling up hotels 
because of the mammoth free publicity for the region and programs 
targeted at minority vendors and inner-city youth. 
</P>
<P>
	``The profile is more important to us than the economics,'' said  
Jim Steeg, the NFL's vice president of special events. ``What they 
don't talk about is the publicity value.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicki Grossman, president of the Greater Fort Lauderdale  
Convention and Visitors Bureau, says the Super Bowl brings in 
corporate executives scouting for future places to hold conventions 
and stockholder meetings. These big rollers can't help but inject 
dollars into the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know the kind of spenders that are in town during Super  
Bowl,'' Ms. Grossman said. ``I am not at least uncomfortable with 
the estimate of a total economic impact of $380 million on south 
Florida.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Porter is convinced she is mistaken.  
</P>
<P>
	He says the NFL relies on a model meant to measure money  
generated from sports on a year-around basis, exaggerating the 
effects of a Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Taxable sales and gross sales generated during three Super Bowls  
in Miami, two in Tampa and one Phoenix show that purchases did not 
change over previous Januarys, Porter said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There ought to be a spike that sticks up like a sore thumb,''  
Porter said. ``It doesn't exist. There is no blip. You don't find 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter says the estimated 140,000 fans that come in for Super  
Bowls in tourist-oriented economies in Florida, Arizona or 
California displace the usual visitors hailing from colder climes. 
</P>
<P>
	If there were actually an increase in tourism during the Super  
Bowl the airlines would need to find hundreds of extra planes and 
there are no extra flights, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL commissioned a study by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP that  
found San Diego County garnered $295 million from last January's 
Super Bowl. The figure was not released until October as the NFL 
squabbled with the auditing firm over the study's mechanics, 
including whether to use the model Porter says is flawed, Steeg of 
the NFL said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had our ideas and they had their ideas. They wanted to make  
sure their study stood up to the critique of their fellow 
analysts,'' Steeg said. ``I think those numbers are pretty good. I 
think we hit it about 90 percent right.''

<HEADLINE> In Defense, Ruff Stretches Too </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- White House lawyer Charles Ruff's mission  
Tuesday was to create doubts about the strength of the evidence 
against President Clinton. In highlighting the weaknesses, Ruff 
denounced House managers for occasional ``fudge-making.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in the process, Ruff did some ``fudge-making'' of his own.  
</P>
<P>
	In his remarks to the Senate, Ruff suggested Clinton lawyer  
Robert Bennett had invited lawyers for Paula Jones to ask Clinton 
pointed questions last Jan. 17 about the nature of any sexual 
activity between the president and Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Bennett at the time of the deposition pressed the Jones  
lawyers to ask the president specific questions about his conduct, 
rather than rely on this confusing definition they proffered,'' 
said Ruff. 
</P>
<P>
	That was less than the full picture.  
</P>
<P>
	At the start of Clinton's Jan. 17 deposition, Bennett did say  
that the Jones lawyers should ask the president, ``What happened 
..., what did you do, what didn't you do'' in regard to Clinton's 
alleged relationships with various women. 
</P>
<P>
	But when the deposition turned to Monica Lewinsky, Bennett tried  
to put a stop to the questioning as the Jones lawyers inquired 
whether Clinton and the former White House intern had ever gone 
into a hallway leading from the Oval Office to a private kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying he was afraid the Jones lawyers' ``innuendo'' would be  
leaked to the news media, Bennett referred to the affidavit Ms. 
Lewinsky had filed saying she'd never had a sexual relationship 
with the president. Clinton ended up denying he'd ever had ``a 
sexual affair'' or ``sexual relations'' with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	In another instance, Ruff attacked the House prosecutors' case  
involving Vernon Jordan's efforts to help Ms. Lewinsky find a 
private job in New York around the time she was emerging as a 
witness in the Jones case. But in doing so, Ruff left out some 
relevant testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff showed that House managers were wrong when they suggested  
that Jordan's job search went into high gear on Dec. 11, 1997 
because a judge had ruled that day that Mrs. Jones' lawyers could 
look into Clinton's relationships with other women, like Ms. 
Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff revealed that the court ruling wasn't made until that  
evening, after the Lewinsky meeting with Jordan had already 
occurred and when Jordan was on a plane to Europe. He said those 
facts made it impossible for the judge's decision to have played a 
role in Jordan's decision to help Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ruff didn't focus on two other facts: Ms. Lewinsky testified  
in detail about her meeting on Dec. 11 with Jordan and the 
president has testified that he already knew by Dec. 11 that Ms. 
Lewinsky was on Mrs. Jones' lawyers' list as a potential witness 
against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky said she told Jordan at their Dec. 11 meeting that  
she got angry at the president ``when he doesn't call me enough or 
see me enough.'' She said Jordan told her ``You're in love, that's 
what your problem is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan has never been questioned about the Dec. 11 meeting in  
the context of Ms. Lewinsky's account, because her cooperation in 
the investigation of the president didn't begin until after 
Jordan's grand jury testimony had ended. 
</P>
<P>
	His testimony conflicts with Ms. Lewinsky from time to time, and  
House prosecutors have talked about summoning the presidential 
friend as a trial witness to address those conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, Jordan testified ``I don't think so'' when asked  
whether Ms. Lewinsky told him anything Dec. 11 that revealed a 
relationship of any kind with the president.

<HEADLINE> D.C. Pollster Burglarized Twice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the second time in a week, burglars hit  
the Capitol Hill offices of a prominent Democratic pollster who is 
advising an Israeli candidate for prime minister, police said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were able to get past a new and far more sophisticated  
security system we put in,'' said Jeremy Rosner, vice president of 
the polling firm Greenberg Quinlan Research Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The new system was installed after burglars entered through a  
vent on the roof last week, taking confidential records, a laptop 
and other items, including petty cash, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest break-in, someone entered through a second floor  
window of the Capitol Hill walkup, said police. Police spokesman 
Joe Gentile said it was unclear what was taken, but that the 
department was looking into the possibility the two incidents may 
have been connected. 
</P>
<P>
	The burglary occurred between 4 p.m. Monday and 6:45 a.m.  
Tuesday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosner said that there has been ``increasing reason to believe  
... that whoever is doing this is targeting our work on the Israeli 
campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company is advising Israeli Labor Party leader Ehud Barak, a  
leading challenger to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in 
elections scheduled for May 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli police also are investigating break-ins at the offices  
and homes of seven Barak advisers in Tel Aviv, said Tal 
Silberstein, Barak's campaign manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Silberstein said ``it's too much of a coincidence'' for the  
burglaries in Washington and Israel not to be related. He said the 
thefts are not expected to affect the Barak campaign. ``No 
strategic memo or survey is going to affect the outcome of the 
election,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu's Likud Party, denied any involvement in the earlier  
break-in in Washington. They could not be reached for comment 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Greenberg Quinlan firm also has advised President Clinton  
and South African President Nelson Mandela. Among those working at 
the firm is outspoken Clinton defender, James Carville.

<HEADLINE> FCC Weighs Data-Phone Co. Link </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Regulators are considering letting major local  
phone companies provide high-speed data services within their 
states as long as they do so through a separate subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
	The move is being prompted because popularity of the Internet is  
causing congestion on telecommunications networks. While a voice 
phone call lasts, on average, three or four minutes, when people go 
online, they average 28 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Existing regulations bar the nation's five regional Bell  
companies from moving data across local calling boundaries -- known 
as LATAs-- within their states because that would constitute 
``long-distance'' service. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Federal Communications Commission later this month will  
decide whether to ease those restrictions for the regional Bell 
telephone companies. It would be part of a larger proposal to give 
local phone companies incentives to build faster connections to 
America's homes and ease Internet congestion. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency is expected to adopt a final plan on Jan. 28.  
</P>
<P>
	But some Bell companies aren't all that interested.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are not at all enamored by it,'' said Robert Blau, vice  
president at BellSouth Corp. ``It doesn't buy you much in terms of 
offering data services which are inherently interstate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other Bells have made similar comments.  
</P>
<P>
	And long-distance companies don't like the idea either.  
</P>
<P>
	Bell companies currently have to open their local phone markets  
to competition if they want the ``carrot'' of providing 
long-distance service -- be it data or telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC proposal ``would let the Bells eat half that carrot  
without opening their markets to competitors,'' complained AT&AMP;T 
vice president Leonard Cali. ``It permanently reduces their 
incentive for opening markets for other services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bells also have complained about having to set up a separate  
affiliate to provide high-speed data services to get regulatory 
relief. They argue this would be burdensome and increase the costs 
of providing the services. 
</P>
<P>
	But AT&AMP;T, MCI WorldCom and other long-distance providers  
complained that the separate affiliate provisions weren't strong 
enough to prevent the Bells from extending their current monopolies 
into the data services business.

<HEADLINE> Bennett Gets to Fifth Super Bowl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Cornelius Bennett can admit it now. He never  
expected to get another chance at a Super Bowl ring with the 
Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	When the linebacker signed with the Falcons in 1996 after going  
to four title games with the Buffalo Bills, his unspoken goals were 
modest. It would have been inappropriate to speak his mind at the 
time, but the Super Bowl wasn't on the list. 
</P>
<P>
	Not in Atlanta. Not after three decades of mediocrity.  
</P>
<P>
	``I can't lie,'' Bennett said. ``I wish I could say, yeah, I  
knew we were going to turn this thing around. All I wanted to do 
when I came to Atlanta was make this a respectable team. Hopefully, 
one that would consistently go to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``But to have a chance to get to the Super Bowl? No, I couldn't  
realistically say that I expected this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett will join an elite group of players who have taken part  
in five Super Bowls when the Falcons play in their first, meeting 
the Denver Broncos at Miami's Pro Player Stadium Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one player will have more title games. Denver defensive  
tackle Mike Lodish, a former teammate of Bennett's during those 
Super Bowl years in Buffalo, will be making his second straight 
appearance with the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	Lodish finally earned a championship ring last year when the  
Broncos upset Green Bay. Bennett has yet to be part of a winning 
Super Bowl team, suffering through four straight losses by the 
Bills from 1991-94. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe that's why he had such a fire in his eyes but a sense of  
desperation in his voice as he celebrated in the locker room 
following the 30-27 victory over Minnesota in the NFC championship 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Give me a hug, big fellow,'' he told teammate Gene Williams,  
pulling him into an embrace. ``Let's go down to Miami and win this 
thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 33, Bennett feels fortunate to have another chance. His  
career was in doubt after he pleaded guilty to sexual misconduct 
and spent more than a month in jail during the offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	The case stemmed from a May 1997 sexual encounter in a Buffalo  
hotel room. Bennett, who is married, was charged after the victim 
was treated for trauma and skin cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett entered counseling and became a born-again Christian,  
serving his sentence with the help of a Bible. According to his 
teammates and coach Dan Reeves, the linebacker emerged from jail 
with a different outlook on life. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the beginning of the season, I was so thankful that coach  
Reeves kept me on this team,'' Bennett said. ``He believed in me, 
so now I have to contribute to make this a good team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett, a Pro Bowl alternate, led the Falcons with 120 tackles  
this season, also breaking up eight passes and recovering two 
fumbles. After a dismal first season in Atlanta, when the team was 
3-13, he has spent the past two years spearheading a defensive 
revitalization. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even with some of the things that happened to him in the  
offseason, he bounced back,'' linebacker Jessie Tuggle said. ``It's 
almost like he's a changed person now. He works very hard. He keeps 
the team motivated. He's a leader. He gives it everything he has.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons, one of the league's worst defensive teams for most  
of the decade, ranked second against the run, fourth in points 
allowed and eighth in total defense this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Their most impressive performance came Sunday in the NFC  
championship game. Atlanta surrendered points to the high-scoring 
Vikings on their first four possessions, then allowed only one 
touchdown over the final 44:37 of the overtime game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is going to take time for us to get some credit,'' Bennett  
said. ``People are going to say that we don't deserve to be in the 
Super Bowl. If we win the Super Bowl, people are going to say we 
were lucky. But all of it counts. 
</P>
<P>
	``People tend to call it luck. I call it faith.''

<HEADLINE> Delaware Lawyer Convicted of Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- When jurors consider whether Thomas  
Capano should die for murdering his mistress, prosecutors plan to 
bring evidence of his effort to harass another woman who had 
spurned him. 
</P>
<P>
	Capano, a wealthy, politically connected attorney who was  
convicted Sunday of killing his mistress, was recorded by an 
informant in 1980. The informant says Capano asked him to hurt a 
woman he had pursued for years, according to court affidavits. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan was not carried out, but the informant did make several  
telephone calls to the woman to harass her at Capano's request, 
according to affidavits. Prosecutors hope to show Capano is a 
dangerous man despite his lack of a criminal record, The 
(Wilmington) News Journal reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Capano, 49, was convicted of killing Anne Marie Fahey, Gov.  
Thomas Carper's scheduling secretary, and dumping her body at sea 
in June 1996. He had claimed the 30-year-old Fahey was accidentally 
killed by another mistress in a jealous rage. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-man, six-woman jury deliberated three days before  
agreeing with the prosecution and returning the guilty verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	The penalty phase begins Wednesday. The only sentencing options  
available are the death penalty or life in prison without parole. 
Jurors make a recommendation and it is up to the judge to pronounce 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Capano, an aide to a former governor and mayor, hope  
to show that his years of public service should save him from 
execution. 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged 1980 plot was revealed in September 1997 by FBI  
Agent Eric J. Alpert in an affidavit filed in connection with the 
Fahey case to get permission to seize e-mail and voice-mail 
messages from Capano's office. 
</P>
<P>
	According to affidavits, Capano told the unidentified informant,  
who once was convicted of threatening someone, that he wanted to 
hurt a legal secretary -- identified by The News Journal as Linda J. 
Marandola -- and wanted to find someone who would ``knock her over 
the head or run over her with a car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The informant said Capano did not want Ms. Marandola killed, but  
chose to have her threatened, and the informant made threatening 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Marandola, who lived in an apartment complex owned by the  
Capano family, also began receiving eviction notices, and she soon 
moved from the state. 
</P>
<P>
	The informant made tape recordings of the harassing calls and  
his conversations with Capano and turned them over to a former FBI 
agent. Authorities took no action against Capano in 1980 because 
the evidence was deemed insufficient to bring a case. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Marandola, 44, is expected to be a key prosecution witness.  
She said Capano began pressuring her in 1977 to have a sexual 
affair but she resisted because ``she was engaged and he was 
married,'' according to the affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1987, after Ms. Marandola divorced, Capano took her to  
Atlantic City for her 33rd birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	During that trip, however, Ms. Marandola told Capano she dated  
other men and he became ``enraged and called her a slut and a 
whore,'' the affidavit said.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Fall Sharply / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices fell sharply  
Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid perceptions world demand 
for U.S. products will remain weak in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybean futures initially fell as beneficial weekend  
rains increased the likelihood that Argentina and Brazil will bring 
in largest harvests, at a time when a global economic crisis has 
rocked American export business. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures retreated on news that Egypt, one of the largest  
purchasers of American wheat, had tendered for only one U.S. cargo 
over the weekend, instead choosing to buy competing crops from 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Futures prices across the board also faced continued pressure  
from concerns Brazil's economic crisis will spread to other Latin 
American nations, reducing what scant demand U.S. farmers have been 
relying on in the face of currency troubles in Asia and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery fell 8 1/2 cents to $2.68 1/2 a bushel; March  
corn fell 1 3/4 cents to $2.13 3/4 a bushel; March oats fell 2 cents to 
$1.05 3/4 a bushel; March soybeans fell 7 1/4 cents to $5.25 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat and livestock futures were mostly lower on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	February live cattle fell .23 cent to 62.97 cents a pound; March  
feeder cattle fell .40 cent to 73.65 cents a pound; February lean 
hogs fell 1.13 cents to 38.82 cents a pound; February pork bellies 
fell .55 cent to 53.05 cents a pound, while the March contract fell 
.88 cent to 53.32 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> $470M Shipbuilding Merger Completed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (AP) -- Newport News Shipbuilding and Avondale  
Industries announced a $470 million merger Tuesday creating a 
company capable of designing, building and maintaining the entire 
Navy fleet. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company will be known as Newport News Avondale  
Industries and will have almost 24,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``The combination of Newport News and Avondale brings together  
two highly skilled and tremendously capable shipbuilding 
companies,'' said William P. Fricks, chairman and chief executive 
officer of Newport News Shipbuilding. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert L. Bossier Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of  
New Orleans-based Avondale, said the merger ``is about building a 
stronger combined company. Avondale's experience in the 
construction of Navy and commercial surface ships complements 
Newport News' strengths in aircraft carrier and submarine 
construction, refueling, and overhaul.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Byron Callan, a shipbuilding industry analyst at Merrill Lynch  
in New York, said the merger reflects a trend that is likely to 
continue among ship construction companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been an ongoing process,'' said Callan. ``... It  
looks like you're going to have two yards, possibly three, when all 
is said and done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This doesn't ring any alarms or set off any concerns,''  
retired Rear Adm. Eugene Carroll, deputy director of the 
Washington-based Center for Defense Information, a Pentagon 
watchdog group, said of the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	``We accept mergers and consolidations of defense contractors as  
a fact of life, with the compression of the services and the 
limited procurement budgets,'' Carroll said. ``They have to get 
themselves shaped to profit from less business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Callan said the new company's principal competitor for Navy  
business will be General Dynamics. 
</P>
<P>
	General Dynamics declined to comment on the merger, and the Navy  
is not allowed to comment on defense industry mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company will have estimated 1999 revenues of $2.6  
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock-for-stock transaction approved by the boards of  
directors of the two companies will give Avondale shareholders 
1.196 shares of Newport News stock for each share of Avondale 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger is subject to approval by the shareholders of both  
companies and by federal regulators. The deal is expected to close 
in the second quarter of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Fricks noted that the combined company will have operations on  
the East, West and Gulf coasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Fricks will become chairman and chief executive in the new  
company, and Bossier will serve as vice chairman while remaining 
president and chief executive of Avondale. 
</P>
<P>
	Fricks said the new company will start with a $6 billion backlog  
in contract work. The total includes over $2.5 billion for aircraft 
carrier construction, refueling and maintenance through 2002. 
Submarine construction programs represent nearly $1 billion, and 
the first two ships of a new class of amphibious assault ships 
represent $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport News Shipbuilding was a division of Tenneco Inc. until  
December 1996 when it became an independent company. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Avondale closed at $27.12 1/2, up 25 cents, in trading on  
the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of Newport News closed down 18 3/4 
cents to $29.68 3/4, also on the NYSE.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Higher at Midday / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was lower against the yen midday  
Wednesday in the absence of major market-moving news. Japanese 
stocks slipped amid growing skepticism about the pace of the 
nation's economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 113.41 yen at late morning, down 0.63 yen from  
late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its level of 113.49 yen in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average fell 26.66 points, or 0.19 percent,  
ending the morning session at 13,743.78. On Tuesday, the average 
closed down 34.62 points, or 0.25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, players were paying more attention to  
overseas developments, including testimony by Federal Reserve 
Chairman Alan Greenspan later Wednesday in the United States and 
the Brazilian economy. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices fell back as investors  
remained skeptical about the economy's chances of moving onto a 
recovery path this year, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi offered optimistic views  
on Japan's economy, but market reaction was muted. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank shares were mixed but mostly higher after more indications  
of consolidation within Japan's banking industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanwa Bank Ltd. and Toyo Trust and Banking Co. have reached a  
basic agreement to form a comprehensive alliance in the pension 
business, reported the Nihon Keizai, Japan's top business daily. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous day, Mitsui Trust and Banking Co. and Chuo Trust  
and Banking Co. said they will begin negotiations toward a merger 
to form the nation's largest trust bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese banks are struggling to dispose of mountains of bad  
loans left from the collapse of property prices in the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 2.15 points, or 0.20 percent, to 1,072.65. 
The TOPIX closed down 0.99 points, or 0.09 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond  
fell to 1.860 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.765 percent, 
driving its price up to 99.51 yen from 99.47 yen.

<HEADLINE>  Rodman Is Retiring -- Or Is He? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Worm took an unexpected turn. In another  
curious lifestyle choice, Dennis Rodman has retired -- or has he? 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after his agent announced Tuesday that Rodman was  
``retiring,'' the NBA's most outlandish player denied it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to play this year,'' Rodman told Fox Sports  
News. ``I am in limbo, but I'm not going to say I'm retired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And once again -- just like his bizarre wedding to Carmen Electra  
-- it showed that nothing with Rodman is ever quite certain. 
</P>
<P>
	In a strange twist earlier in the day, his former coach, Chuck  
Daly of the Orlando Magic, said he had heard Rodman had been traded 
to the New York Knicks for Buck Williams -- a rumor that was quickly 
shot down. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, whose multicolored hair, body piercings and tattoos made  
a fashion statement across the NBA and beyond, has become the 
latest star to leave Chicago as the Bulls rebuild after the 
retirement of Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	But is he gone for good?  
</P>
<P>
	The seven-time rebounding leader who once donned a wedding gown,  
kicked a cameraman, head-butted a referee and dated Madonna is 
leaving the game, Rodman's agent said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dennis is retiring,'' Dwight Manley said, although Rodman has  
considered retiring in each of the last five years. ``He doesn't 
want to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He wants to go into the sports and entertainment field. Some  
people have convinced him that he wants to become a movie star.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manley got the news from Rodman in a phone conversation Tuesday

1998, and two titles with the Detroit Pistons in 1989 and 1990.

<HEADLINE>  Rodman Is Retiring -- Or Is He? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Worm took an unexpected turn. In another  
curious lifestyle choice, Dennis Rodman has retired -- or has he? 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after his agent announced Tuesday that Rodman was  
``retiring,'' the NBA's most outlandish player denied it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to play this year,'' Rodman told Fox Sports  
News. ``I am in limbo, but I'm not going to say I'm retired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And once again -- just like his bizarre wedding to Carmen Electra  
-- it showed that nothing with Rodman is ever quite certain. 
</P>
<P>
	In a strange twist earlier in the day, his former coach, Chuck  
Daly of the Orlando Magic, said he had heard Rodman had been traded 
to the New York Knicks for Buck Williams -- a rumor that was quickly 
shot down. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, whose multicolored hair, body piercings and tattoos made  
a fashion statement across the NBA and beyond, has become the 
latest star to leave Chicago as the Bulls rebuild after the 
retirement of Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	But is he gone for good?  
</P>
<P>
	The seven-time rebounding leader who once donned a wedding gown,  
kicked a cameraman, head-butted a referee and dated Madonna is 
leaving the game, Rodman's agent said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dennis is retiring,'' Dwight Manley said, although Rodman has  
considered retiring in each of the last five years. ``He doesn't 
want to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He wants to go into the sports and entertainment field. Some  
people have convinced him that he wants to become a movie star.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manley got the news from Rodman in a phone conversation Tuesday  
and said there are several teams still interested in signing the 
wacky 37-year-old Rodman, known for his ferocious workouts and 
frequent forays to Las Vegas.

<HEADLINE> Greek Students Protest Exam Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Riot police fired tear gas Tuesday to  
break up a protest by student demonstrators who threw gasoline 
bombs and rocks in a showdown over education reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Students are opposing a stricter school exam system that also  
creates more places at universities. Teachers, who support the 
students, have announced strikes for Thursday and Monday. They are 
upset by a new performance-based hiring system. 
</P>
<P>
	Students and teachers were joined Tuesday by sympathetic  
construction workers in a rally in central Athens. Store windows 
were shattered, but no serious injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Riot police had taken up posts around the planned march route to  
try to avert a repeat of the violence that marred a similar 
demonstration Friday by about 20,000 students. Tuesday's march was 
much smaller than expected, with an estimated 3,000 protesters. 
</P>
<P>
	Premier Costas Simitis met with the embattled education  
minister, Gerasimos Arsenis, to discuss ways to defuse the 
two-month-old crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Socialist government is increasingly worried that the  
student unrest could touch off waves of protests from labor groups 
and others opposed to cutbacks in state spending and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Simitis is trying to stick to a fiscal austerity program aimed  
at earning the European Union's poorest member a spot in the single 
currency group by 2001. Failure, Simitis claims, would make Greece 
an economic outcast in the EU. 
</P>
<P>
	Student protesters continue to occupy more than 500 of the  
country's 3,140 state high schools, where classes have been 
disrupted since November. Private schools have been unaffected by 
the protests. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has said it is willing to discuss the reforms and  
possibly modify them, but only after students return to school. 
</P>
<P>
	The public's tolerance, however, has been wearing thin,  
particularly among drivers often stuck for hours in traffic jams 
when students arbitrarily set up blockades.

<HEADLINE> RNC Chair Wary of Right-Wing Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chairman of the Republican National  
Committee called on his fellow party members Tuesday to resign from 
the Council of Conservative Citizens because ``it appears that this 
group does hold racist views.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A member of the party of (Abraham) Lincoln should not belong  
to such an organization,'' GOP Chairman Jim Nicholson said. 
</P>
<P>
	He appealed directly to Buddy Witherspoon, one of the party's  
national committee members from South Carolina, to resign from the 
council. Witherspoon, an orthodontist from Columbia, S.C., told 
Nicholson he would not do anything of the sort. 
</P>
<P>
	Witherspoon insisted the council's South Carolina chapter holds  
no racist views, but is simply an advocate for conservative causes, 
especially fighting to retain the right to display the Confederate 
flag in the South. 
</P>
<P>
	``Never have I heard anything said about race in any way, shape  
or form,'' Witherspoon said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis-based council has mushroomed into a national  
embarrassment for the Republican National Committee in recent weeks 
amid reports that both Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., 
and Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., spoke at its meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Barr and Lott have said they were not aware of the  
council's racist positions. Barr said last month he disagrees 
``with many of this group's ridiculous views.'' Last week, Lott 
also distanced himself from the group. 
</P>
<P>
	The council's World Wide Web site includes numerous articles  
suggesting that the white race is under siege. On Tuesday, visitors 
were urged to forget ``petty pretenders'' such as Martin Luther 
King Jr., and celebrate the birthday of ``the greatest American who 
ever lived'' -- General Robert E. Lee, leader of Confederate forces 
during the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no room for racist views in the Republican Party,''  
said Nicholson. ``I never heard of the CCC until a few days ago, 
but it appears that this group does hold racist views. The 
Republican Party rejects and condemns such views forcefully and 
without hesitation or equivocation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The issue is likely to come up at this week's RNC's winter  
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	At the meeting, Witherspoon is planning to also attract action  
because he plans to propose a resolution that would require the GOP 
to stop taking donations from gambling interests, and require that 
party donations be withheld from any candidate who supports 
legalized gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	Common Cause, a government finance watchdog, reports that from  
1988 to 1998, the gambling industry made $7.2 million in ``soft 
money donations'' to the GOP, versus $6.3 million to the Democratic 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
	The video poker lobby also played an instrumental role this fall  
in defeating South Carolina Gov. David Beasley, a Republican who 
opposed creating a state lottery. Witherspoon said he supported 
Beasley.

<HEADLINE> Report: AtHome To Buy Excite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- High-speed Internet provider AtHome Corp. could  
announce an agreement as early as today to purchase Excite Inc., 
one of the leading destinations on the World Wide Web, according to 
published reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock transaction is worth about $6 billion, the New York  
Times reported Tuesday. It would be one of the largest Internet 
company deals ever, surpassing America Online Inc.'s $4.2 billion 
acquisition of Netscape Communications Corp. last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Boards of both companies were meeting Monday night to work out  
last-minute details, the Times said, with an announcement possible 
in New York today. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on closing stock prices Friday, Excite is worth about $3.4  
billion, meaning that AtHome would be paying a premium of about 75 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at both AtHome and Excite declined comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The deal could eventually give telecommunications giant AT&AMP;T  
Corp. control of one of the highly sought-after portals that serve 
as entry points onto the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	AtHome is owned by Tele-Communications Inc., Cox Communications  
and several other investors. TCI is in the process of merging with 
AT&AMP;T Corp. in a $39 billion deal. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T Corp. chief executive Michael Armstrong has stated he wants  
to use AtHome as a conduit for delivering a wide range of 
communications services, including electronic commerce. Control 
over Excite, which has a search engine and links to several online 
shopping sites, would certainly enhance that goal. 
</P>
<P>
	TCI officials declined to comment, referring questions to  
AtHome. 
</P>
<P>
	Excite has reportedly been looking for a larger partner in the  
rapidly consolidating Internet portal market, especially in wake of 
the AOL-Netscape deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Several other companies had been rumored to be interested in  
Excite, including Yahoo! Inc. and Microsoft Corp. Negotiations 
between Yahoo! and Excite broke off this weekend, the newspaper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	People familiar with the deal said Excite, eager to extend its  
reach and market power, was attracted by an alliance with AT&AMP;T and 
TCI. 
</P>
<P>
	News of a possible announcement also was reported today by The  
Wall Street Journal and on MSNBC's Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Excite's shareholders are expected to own about 30 percent of  
the combined company, which would be known as @Home. Excite chief 
executive George Bell would take a position on the new company's 
executive board, the Times said. 
</P>
<P>
	AtHome, which delivers high-speed Internet service over cable TV  
lines, has more than 330,000 customers. The deal would give it 
access to Excite's more than 20 million registered users and to the 
company's content-development capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies are located in Redwood City, Calif.  
</P>
<P>
	AtHome, whose stock has risen nearly 300 percent over the past  
year, has the money to make a deal, Michael Harris, president of 
Kinetic Strategies Inc. told MSNBC. ``With AtHome's existing stock 
valuation (of about $11.7 billion), it's been surprising they 
haven't done more deals. They've certainly got a huge war chest 
built up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither company has been making a profit. In the three months  
ended Sep. 30, Excite lost $6.8 million on revenue of $44 million, 
including acquisition and amortization expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same period, AtHome lost $9.7 million on revenue of $13.8  
million.

<HEADLINE> Elway May Have Thrown Last Pass </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The AFC title was decided. It was simply a matter  
of getting through the final 95 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, with a 23-10 lead and with the ball at the New York 24,  
Denver Broncos coach Mike Shanahan called a pass play. What was 
that all about? 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan talked strategy. Everyone else talked tribute -- to John  
Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the reasons we threw that was we wanted to put the game  
away,'' Shanahan said. ``I told John, if it was there, to take 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's like telling a shark to go after chum. So Elway faded  
back and barely overthrew wide-open Ed McCaffrey in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Normally, such a pass would be insignificant. But on Sunday,  
with his adoring fans screaming his name and chanting ``One More 
Year,'' it was a memorable play because it probably was the last 
one for Elway at Mile High Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have loved to make a catch on that last play,'' said  
McCaffrey, who has become Elway's favorite target near the end 
zone. ``But I wasn't able to come up with it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really didn't think about it as being John's last pass in  
Mile High. But when somebody said something on the sidelines, I 
kind of realized, `Wow, it would have been great to catch it.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't really matter. The fans still paid adoring tribute to  
Elway, who took a victory lap, holding the AFC Championship trophy 
high for all to see. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't feel comfortable, taking that lap,'' said Elway,  
expected to announce his retirement after a little more business, 
the Super Bowl vs. Atlanta on Jan. 31 in Miami. ``But I'm glad I 
did it. I had a chance to see the fans and look into their eyes, to 
really concentrate on them. They were so happy. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's one of the nicest things about playing. You win a  
football game, and the fans are that happy. I'm glad to see that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He certainly would have been glad to see McCaffrey hang onto  
that final pass, but they did connect on the biggest play of the 
game, a 47-yarder in the third quarter after New York went ahead 
10-0. 
</P>
<P>
	That bomb, on which McCaffrey and Rod Smith lined up incorrectly  
and had to run each other's routes, turned around the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the play we needed to get us out of the funk,'' Elway  
said. ``We really hadn't done anything. It was huge for us, it got 
the momentum going, got the fans back in it a little bit, restored 
a little confidence and perked everyone up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If that was his final Mile High Stadium game, Elway closed his  
career with 96 victories there in the regular season, and nine in 
the postseason. He's led the Broncos to five Super Bowls there. 
</P>
<P>
	When a new stadium opens in a few years -- well into Elway's  
retirement -- might one of the names considered for it be John Elway 
Stadium? 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's ever been a guy in the NFL who  
symbolized his town like John Elway,'' Shannon Sharpe said. ``If 
you think of Denver, you don't think of skiing. You think of John 
Elway. It's always been John, and even if he retires, it will still 
always be John.''

<HEADLINE> Court: Lottery Head Unjustly Fired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A federal appeals court reversed a $2 million  
judgment for a former Connecticut lottery director on Tuesday, 
deciding he was fired justly in 1989 for criticizing a change that 
made the Lotto jackpot harder to win. 
</P>
<P>
	J. Blaine Lewis Jr., 78, of Glastonbury, Conn., had claimed his  
dismissal violated the First Amendment. But the 2nd U.S. Circuit 
Court of Appeals said he was fired for what amounted to 
insubordination. 
</P>
<P>
	``A high-ranking policy-making employee does not have, and never  
has had, a First Amendment right to refuse his employer's directive 
to promote agency policy,'' the court ruled. 
</P>

supervisors' programs and ``voicing his personal opinion and 
perhaps losing his job.'' 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	As head of the state's lottery, Lewis was ordered by a state  
board to oversee an increase in the field of Lotto numbers from 40 
to 44, thus making it harder to pick six correct numbers but 
theoretically creating bigger purses and more publicity. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis refused to keep his objections quiet.  
</P>
<P>
	He sued the board that dismissed him, and a jury awarded him $2  
million. The appeals court said Lewis was not entitled to any of 
the money.

<HEADLINE> Panthers Excited About Pavel Bure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida Panthers defenseman Rhett Warrener  
almost can't wait to be victimized by Pavel Bure now. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be nice to be embarrassed in practice instead of  
games. He just keeps you backing up and hoping he'll shoot wide of 
the net,'' said Warrener, who gains Bure as a teammate when the 
high-scoring Russian joins the Panthers today. 
</P>
<P>
	Bure ended his five-month holdout Sunday when the Vancouver  
Canucks sent him to Florida as part of a seven-player trade, giving 
the Panthers their first true offensive star. 
</P>
<P>
	No Florida player has scored more than 32 goals in the  
franchise's six-year history. Bure has topped 50 goals three times 
in his seven NHL seasons, bringing a combination of speed and 
explosiveness that is virtually unmatched. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody can do things at top speed. His top speed is just  
faster,'' said Ray Whitney, Florida's leading scorer with 14 goals. 
``It's noticeable. The things he can do at top speed is 
different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rob Niedermayer called Bure's acquisition ``a dream come true.''  
</P>
<P>
	``To get a chance to play with a guy like that -- any centerman  
in the league would relish that,'' Niedermayer said. ``It certainly 
gets me excited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bure spent Monday finalizing travel to New York, where the  
Panthers play Wednesday against the Islanders and Thursday against 
the Rangers. A decision on whether Bure would play Wednesday was 
put off until he had a chance to meet with team officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really happy when my agent called me and said I was  
going to the Florida Panthers,'' Bure said Monday from his home in 
Moscow. ``I know it's a young team. I hope we can do something good 
for the franchise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A history of confrontations with former general manager Pat  
Quinn apparently soured Bure on the Canucks, leading him to demand 
a trade last summer and vow he would not return to Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, Bure threatened to sit out the Stanley Cup finals if  
the team didn't move to finalize a five-year contract that had been 
negotiated. When that was done, he said management didn't back him 
strongly enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years later, he made similar complaints after major knee  
surgery and back spasms limited him to just 23 goals in 63 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Bure would not discuss his relationship with the Canucks when  
asked Monday. But he disputed a statement by Canucks president 
Brian Burke that he had wearied of living in a fishbowl atmosphere 
in Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's so funny. I never said that,'' Bure said. ``People were  
really nice to me there. I have a lot of friends there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since returning to Russia, Bure has been working out twice a day  
with CSKA Moscow, the former Red Army team where he spent his first 
four years as a professional. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the workouts have left him in good shape, but not  
playing in games became a grind. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was really frustrating for me,'' he said. ``I was missing  
hockey a lot and was missing the fans. It's really hard -- day after 
day going to practice and no games, not knowing when I'd start to 
play. I'm really happy it's over.''

<HEADLINE> House Employee Has Heart Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An employee in the Office of the Clerk at the  
U.S. House of Representatives suffered a heart attack shortly after 
President Clinton ended his State of the Union address Tuesday 
night, U.S. Capitol Police spokesman Dan Nichols said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities would not comment on the man's condition, and they  
withheld his identity until his family is notified. 
</P>
<P>
	The man collapsed in the Democratic Cloakroom just off the House  
chamber after President Clinton completed his State of the Union 
speech to a joint session of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols said the House's doctor, a Navy physician, tended to the  
man before he was transported to George Washington University 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``It happened right after the State of the Union,'' Nichols  
said. ``It's not uncommon during large-scale events for there to be 
medical emergencies, but this is the first time I can remember 
someone had a heart attack during the State of the Union.''

<HEADLINE> Court Rejects 'Three-Strikes' Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court left intact California's  
three-strikes law, the nation's toughest on repeat offenders, even 
though four of the nine justices voiced concerns Tuesday about its 
constitutionality. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices rejected the appeal of a man sentenced to 25 years  
to life in prison after he stole a bottle of vitamins from a 
supermarket, a crime one California court called ``a petty theft 
motivated by homelessness and hunger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nine-time loser Michael Riggs, in an appeal he wrote himself,  
had attacked the three-strikes law as cruel and unusual punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	In other matters Tuesday, the court:  
</P>
<P>
	--Let Florida continue using the electric chair as the sole means  
of imposing the death penalty, rejecting a condemned man's 
contention that electrocution is a cruel and outmoded method of 
capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	--Rejected a bid by the nation's biggest local phone companies to  
ease their way into the $90 billion long-distance market. Three of 
the five regional Bell telephone companies had challenged the 
special hurdles Congress placed in the way of their offering 
long-distance service. 
</P>
<P>
	In the California three-strikes case, only Justice Stephen G.  
Breyer voted to hear Riggs' appeal. Four votes are needed to grant 
such full review. Three other justices, however, said his case 
raised ``obviously substantial'' issues that first should be 
considered by lower courts. 
</P>
<P>
	About half the states adopted three-strikes earlier this decade  
but those laws generally have not been invoked often. 
</P>
<P>
	California has been the major exception. The state has used its  
1994 law to put away more than 40,000 people for second and third 
strikes -- a quarter of the state's prison population. About 4,400 
of them were sentenced to 25 years to life. 
</P>
<P>
	Another exception is Georgia, which has sentenced nearly 2,000  
people under its three-strikes law. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington state was the first to enact such a law, in 1993, and  
has used it to imprison about 120 people for life without chance of 
parole. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for himself and Justices  
David H. Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, noted that California 
``appears to be the only state in which a misdemeanor could receive 
such a severe sentence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Stevens said other courts should determine whether  
California's law yields sentences that are so ``grossly 
disproportionate'' as to be unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is prudent ... for this court to await review by other  
courts,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Riggs was convicted of shoplifting a bottle of vitamins from an  
Alberston's Store in Banning, Calif., in 1995. When arrested, he 
had a hypodermic syringe hidden in one of his socks. 
</P>
<P>
	He previously had been convicted eight times -- four nonviolent  
crimes and four robberies. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this particular case, the sentence was not cruel and  
unusual punishment,'' state Deputy Attorney General Craig Nelson 
said in a telephone interview from his San Diego office. ``But if 
the justices were inclined to believe it might have been, they were 
right to let it percolate in the lower courts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1980, the court upheld the life sentence of a Texas man whose  
three convictions were for credit card fraud worth $80, forging a 
$28 check and falsely obtaining $120. That inmate was eligible for 
parole after serving 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The court in 1983 overturned a South Dakota man's life sentence  
for six nonviolent crimes, but his sentence carried no chance of 
parole. 
</P>
<P>
	And in 1991, the court upheld a life sentence without  
possibility of parole for a Michigan man convicted of possessing a 
small amount of cocaine. The court ruled then that the Constitution 
bars only those sentences that are ``grossly disproportionate'' to 
the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Other states with three-strikes laws on their books include  
Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, 
Louisiana, Maryland, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North 
Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, 
Virginia and Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Most states have laws that impose stiffer sentences for  
recidivist criminals, but they do not impose punishment as harsh as 
three-strikes laws.

<HEADLINE> Widows of Capitol Hill Cops Honored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton began his annual State of  
the Union address Tuesday by recognizing the widows of two Capitol 
Police officers who were killed last July by a gunman who forced 
his way into the Capitol and opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Lyn Gibson, wife of Special Agent John Gibson, and Wei Ling  
Chestnut, who survives Officer Jacob J. Chestnut, were in the 
gallery as the guests of new House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let me begin by saluting the new speaker of the House, and  
thanking him for extending invitations to two special guests who 
are sitting in the gallery with Mrs. Hastert,'' Clinton said, 
introducing ``the widows of the two brave Capitol Police officers 
who gave their lives to defend freedom's house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suspect in the shootings, Russell E. Weston, allegedly  
forced his way into a Capitol Building entrance, shot Chestnut, and 
then ran down a corridor where he engaged in a gun battle with 
Gibson. He has a 20-year history of mental illness.

<HEADLINE> Tradition of Poe Memorial Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A mysterious stranger clad in a three-quarter  
length black peacoat left roses and cognac at the grave of Edgar 
Allan Poe early today, continuing a tradition that began 50 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	About a dozen people waited inside and outside Westminster  
Church until the tall, unknown visitor made his arrival at the tiny 
brick-walled cemetery just before 3 a.m. EST. 
</P>
<P>
	The stranger placed his hands on Poe's tombstone and appeared to  
pray. A moment later he was gone, leaving three roses and a bottle 
of cognac to mark the 190th birthday of the macabre author. 
</P>
<P>
	The identity of the first mysterious visitor, who had been  
dressed in black topcoat and fedora, has remained a riddle since 
the ritual began in 1949, a century after Poe died. 
</P>
<P>
	The aging visitor believed to be the original carried on the  
tradition until 1993, when he left a cryptic note saying, ``The 
torch will be passed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His followers have agreed to carry on the anonymous annual  
tribute, said Jeff Jerome, curator of the Edgar Allan Poe House and 
Museum in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said they would continue the tradition in his  
footsteps,'' Jerome said. ``I don't want to say too much more 
because some of the note's contents are of a private nature. I'm 
not trying to be mysterious, but some of this has to remain with me 
because it may give a clue as to who it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Poe penned classic horror stories such as ``The Fall of the  
House of Usher,'' ``The Pit and the Pendulum,'' ``The Telltale 
Heart'' and ``The Masque of the Red Death.'' His famous poems 
include ``The Raven'' and ``Annabel Lee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He lived in Baltimore from 1829 to 1836 and died here in 1849 at  
age 40. The three roses left each year are thought to represent the 
poet, his wife, and her mother. All are buried in the tiny 
cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynne Finley, of Nashville, Tenn. spent the night at the church  
with her sister, D.J. Gaskin, of Burke, Va. to celebrate Ms. 
Finley's 40th birthday, which she shares with Poe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Knowing that the tradition will be carried on was encouraging,  
but I was a little saddened,'' Ms. Finley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her sister said the atmosphere was ``almost spooky.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Its such a mysterious devotion,'' Ms. Gaskin said. ``And the  
cemetery is almost like a little time capsule in the middle of the 
city. It's beautiful.''

<HEADLINE> HIV-Positive Private Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ABERDEEN, Md. (AP) -- An HIV-positive Army private was sentenced  
to three years in military prison Tuesday after she pleaded guilty 
to aggravated assault for having unprotected sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerland Squires, 21, also will receive a bad conduct discharge  
from the Army and forfeit all pay and benefits. Her rank was 
immediately reduced from private first class to private. 
</P>
<P>
	After a blood test in June 1997 revealed Ms. Squires had HIV,  
her commander at Aberdeen Proving Ground ordered her to use a 
condom and tell her sexual partners that she carried the AIDS 
virus. 
</P>
<P>
	But Squires did not tell eight men she was HIV-positive and had  
unprotected sex with four of them, prosecutors said. She told a 
ninth man she had the virus but did not make him use a condom. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the nine men -- six enlisted and three civilians -- has  
tested positive for the virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Crying on the stand, Ms. Squires told a military sentencing jury  
she had sex to escape her fear and confusion about having HIV and 
passing it on to her daughter. She said she feared rejection if she 
told her sex partners she has HIV. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of a plea agreement, the Army dropped charges that Ms.  
Squires made a false statement to investigators.

<HEADLINE> Willey Case Witness Pleads Innocent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- A friend whose testimony cast doubt on  
Kathleen Willey's allegation of an unwanted sexual advance by 
President Clinton pleaded innocent today to charges she lied under 
oath. Her lawyer vowed to seek dismissal of the case brought by 
prosecutor Kenneth Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	Accused of three counts of obstruction of justice and one of  
making a false statement, Julie Hiatt Steele said ``I plead 
absolutely not guilty'' during an appearance before U.S. District 
Judge Claude Hilton. A trial date of March 30 was set. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the courthouse, Ms. Steele said she ``could not imagine  
being caught in a political storm ... (for) crimes I did not 
commit.'' She acknowledged she had received offers for significant 
financial help but did not give any details. 
</P>
<P>
	Steele's lawyer, Nancy Luque, said she will file numerous  
pre-trial motions challenging the indictment, which accuses Ms. 
Steele of filing a false affidavit in the Paula Jones sexual 
harassment lawsuit against President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Luque said the indictment was incorrectly filed in Virginia  
because Starr wanted to avoid dealing with the federal courts in 
the District of Columbia. Starr suffered a setback there in a case 
he filed against another defendant in his investigation, Webster 
Hubbell. A federal judge threw out a tax case against Hubbell. 
Starr is appealing the action. 
</P>
<P>
	Luque also said Starr had a conflict of interest stemming from  
the Jones case and promised to challenge the indictment on that 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele filed an affidavit in the Jones case casting doubt on  
the credibility of Kathleen Willey, a former White House volunteer 
who alleges Clinton made an unwanted sexual advance toward her next 
to the Oval Office in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton denies Mrs. Willey's accusation, which became a focus of  
the Jones lawsuit. In his testimony in that case, the president 
said Mrs. Willey ``was not telling the truth'' and that her 
credibility had been ``pretty well shattered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment notes that a lawyer for Clinton approached Ms.  
Steele in January 1998 to get her to file the affidavit and that 
she initially refused, then changed her mind. Ms. Steele eventually 
filed an affidavit in the Jones lawsuit alleging that Mrs. Willey 
never told her about the alleged advance as she had claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	But Starr alleged that the affidavit and Ms. Steele's subsequent  
testimony before two federal grand juries were false. 
</P>
<P>
	Luque offered to waive the speedy trial requirement and delay  
the case, but the judge said there was no reason not to proceed 
promptly.

<HEADLINE> Low Oil Prices Could Hurt States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PAWHUSKA, Okla. (AP) -- It's a frightening sign for folks in the  
nation's oil patch: A gallon of gasoline around here costs 79 
cents, less than the bottled water on gas station shelves. 
</P>
<P>
	``In towns like ours throughout Oklahoma, either a brother, a  
sister, a mother, father, aunt, uncle -- somebody works in oil,'' 
said William Ricketts, the public works director in Pawhuska. ``If 
it goes much lower, everything will come to a standstill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The same fear can be heard from Louisiana to Alaska. With oil  
prices at some of their lowest levels since the Depression, jobs 
are disappearing, businesses are folding and states have less money 
to spend on citizens who need more. 
</P>
<P>
	In Oklahoma, where the governor has called a special legislative  
session beginning today to consider $29 million in tax relief for 
the industry, spending on everything from welfare and Medicaid to 
prisons and roads may have to be cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of tightening our belt another notch, we may have to  
go another couple of notches,'' said state Sen. Kelly Haney, 
chairman of the Appropriations Committee. ``It's not going to be 
easy or comfortable, but we really don't have any other choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gas that sells for 70 to 80 cents a gallon in Oklahoma is a  
blessing for drivers but a curse for independent oil producers like 
Dean Eyler. He has laid off all six of his employees, shut down 15 
wells and is beginning to sell assets to stay afloat. 
</P>
<P>
	Like others here in Pawhuska, 50 miles northwest of Tulsa, he's  
not sure anyone out there cares. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like we have subsidized the rest of the economy,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the state, the pump jacks that usually bob up and down,  
drawing crude from the ground, sit idle, and producers fear an 
estimated 10,000 oil industry jobs in Oklahoma could be lost if 
prices don't pick up. 
</P>
<P>
	Alaska, which loses $95 million for every $1 drop in the price  
of oil per barrel, had to draw nearly $1 billion from cash reserves 
this year to balance its budget. The gap is expected to widen in 
the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Tony Knowles was expected today to propose an income tax --  
something Alaska hasn't had since 1980, when the oil money started 
pouring in -- and dip into the Alaska Permanent Fund, the $24 
billion oil royalty savings account that pays a yearly dividend to 
every state resident. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana faces a possible budget deficit of $15 million to $60  
million, though most of the problem is tied to a college tuition 
program that is more costly than expected. Gov. Mike Foster has 
responded with a six-month freeze on hiring and purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas, the biggest oil state, has remained financially strong  
despite the price drop. The state is projecting big surpluses 
during the next two years, and Gov. George W. Bush wants to reduce 
taxes by $2.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	After oil prices took a similar drop in the 1980s, Texas and  
other oil-producing states diversified their economies to become 
less dependent on oil. In Oklahoma, for example, oil taxes made up 
20 percent of the revenue in 1982. Now they account for less than 1 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, state officials and oil producers say damage is being  
done. 
</P>
<P>
	Largely because of a glut of foreign oil, Oklahoma oil prices  
crashed to $8 a barrel in December and stood at $9.75 as of Friday. 
When the state budget was drawn up last spring, it assumed an 
average price of $17.02 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	E.W. Carter, an Oklahoma oilman since the 1960s, said this  
downturn is ``100 times worse'' than the bust of the 1980s. Even 
giants like Phillips Petroleum haven't been spared. The company 
just announced 900 layoffs in Bartlesville. 
</P>
<P>
	In nearby Hominy, Joyce Whitewing points out a restaurant, an  
antiques store, a variety store and an oil equipment supplier that 
have closed in the past year. Some restaurants in Pawhuska stopped 
serving dinner because no one shows up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody has been slow in responding,'' said Mrs.  
Whitewing, executive vice president of the Osage Producers 
Association. ``This is a crisis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eyler, meanwhile, hopes the worldwide oil glut will pass.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're just almost down to a week-by-week basis,'' said Eyler,  
who wears overalls stained by work he and his son now do alone. 
``We're hanging on for a little higher prices.''

<HEADLINE> Court Won't Revive Redlining Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today refused to revive a  
massive civil rights lawsuit against many of the nation's largest 
insurance companies filed on behalf of 93,000 homeowners living in 
predominantly black neighborhoods of St. Louis and Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices, without comment, left intact rulings that threw  
out the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 lawsuit accused insurance companies of discriminatory  
``redlining'' -- refusing to sell homeowners insurance on equal 
terms based on the racial composition of their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	The insurance companies were accused of conspiring to violate  
the federal Fair Housing Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit alleged that insurers discriminated against minority  
homeowners in one or more of these ways: 
</P>
<P>
	--Explicity refusing to sell any homeowners insurance in minority  
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	--Steering agents away from such neighborhoods.  
</P>
<P>
	--Failing to establish and maintain offices within such  
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	--Steering minority homeowners into buying ``limited'' policies.  
</P>
<P>
	--Charging higher rates in minority neighborhoods.  
</P>
<P>
	Among the 18 companies named as defendants were Allstate, State  
Farm, Liberty Mutual, Prudential and Safeco. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Fernando Gaitan Jr. in Kansas City ruled in  
1997 that those who sued ``lack standing to bring claims against 
defendants against whom they have alleged no direct injury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge's ruling left individual homeowners free to sue ``with  
whom each plaintiff has alleged grievances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  
upheld the dismissal of the class action last August. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for those who had sought  
to represent all minority homeowners in the two cities argued that 
past Supreme Court decisions ``that indirect injury claims are 
fundamental to the enforcement of the Fair Housing Act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The appeal said the alleged redlining imposes such an indirect  
injury by lowering the property values of all homes located within 
minority neighborhoods.

	The case is Canady vs. Allstate Insurance Co., 98-788.

<HEADLINE> Tennis' Graf Reconciles With Father </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMBURG, Germany (AP) -- Steffi Graf has reconciled with her  
father, and he plans to watch her play at the Australian Open, 
Stern magazine reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Graf was released from prison nine months ago after being  
convicted on tax evasion charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf managed his daughter's career during her rise to the No. 1  
ranking and he handled her earnings from her 20 Grand Slam titles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only complaint I have after all this was the lack of  
communication,'' Stern quoted Steffi Graf as saying. ``All he had 
to say was `I can't keep up with it anymore.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Steffi Graf has since hired a professional manager, and her  
father won't be taking over his old job, Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Graf, 59, was sentenced in January 1997 to three years,  
nine months for evading taxes on $6.55 million of his daughter's 
tennis earnings. He was released in April 1998 after serving more 
than half the sentence, counting pretrial custody. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time he was at one his daughter's tournaments was at  
Wimbledon, shortly before he was arrested on Aug. 2, 1995. The 
Australian Open began Monday, and his daughter is seeded 10th.

<HEADLINE> UPS To Settle Bias Suit for $12.1 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- In agreeing to settle a racial discrimination  
lawsuit for $12.1 million, United Parcel Service of America Inc. 
said it wanted to show all its employees they would be treated 
fairly by the Atlanta-based company. 
</P>
<P>
	``With this settlement, we are saying that we are making  
absolutely sure that all our employees understand the options that 
they have available to them and that they do have a future with 
this company,'' said Norman Black, spokesman for the express 
carrier and package delivery company. 
</P>
<P>
	Agreement on the suit, originally filed in U.S. District Court  
in San Francisco in April 1997, was reached Friday. A trial date 
had never been scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	Another lawsuit filed by 11 drivers in July 1997, also alleging  
racial discrimination by UPS, is still pending. 
</P>
<P>
	Black said final approval of the April suit must come from the  
court, which he expected would happen sometime in March. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're assuming that the judge will approve it, and there's no  
reason to believe he won't,'' he said. ``It's the final document by 
both sides.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suit alleged that UPS did not adequately inform its black  
part-time workers of procedures and opportunities for advancement, 
said Black. 
</P>
<P>
	James Finberg, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said black  
workers were not being treated as well as whites when it came to 
promotions. 
</P>
<P>
	The major portion of the settlement -- $8.2 million -- will go to  
about 12,000 current and former part-time hourly black workers in 
the company's Northwest and Pacific regions, UPS said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Finberg said the settlement also includes $476,000 to be paid to  
seven black full-time UPS workers, $150,500 to seven part-time 
employees who were the representative plaintiffs on the lawsuit and 
about $3.3 million in lawyers' fees and other costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement also provides that UPS ``will enhance information  
provided to applicants and employees about job opportunities and 
promotion procedures,'' the company said.

<HEADLINE> Arctic Ozone Loss Could Pose Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The densely populated regions of North America  
and Europe could face the threat of increased ultraviolet radiation 
if ozone loss over the Arctic, such as occurred in 1996 and 1997, 
resumes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ozone in the upper atmosphere blocks the sun's ultraviolet rays,  
which can cause sunburn, skin wrinkling, eye damage and even 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Thinning of that layer over the Antarctic in the 1980s led to  
the ban on ozone-damaging chemicals, such as certain refrigerants 
and spray-can propellants. 
</P>
<P>
	But those chemicals already released remain in the air for  
years, and researchers now are reporting potentially serious 
thinning of the ozone layer over the Arctic, where there is a 
greater hazard to people if the damage spreads. 
</P>
<P>
	It's too soon, however, to declare a definite trend, said the  
scientists, noting that the situation improved a bit last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Damage to the ozone layer was first noticed in the Antarctic,  
where circular winds, known as a vortex, trap air, giving chemicals 
the chance to react with the ozone. 
</P>
<P>
	The Antarctic is usually colder than the Arctic, causing more  
frequent stratospheric clouds of the type that lead to ozone 
depletion within the vortex. In 1996-1997, however, the Arctic 
vortex produced low temperatures and ozone depletion as great as 
that recorded in the Antarctic during the early 1980s, the 
researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	This threatens to ``allow the penetration of enhanced UV  
radiation at northern mid-high latitudes,'' warn researchers in the 
latest issue of the Journal of Geophysical Research, published by 
the American Geophysical Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the sparsely populated region in the southern mid- to  
high-latitudes, an expanded area of damaged ozone in the north 
could affect parts of Europe and North America. 
</P>
<P>
	Georg Hansen of the Norwegian Institute for Air Research in  
Tromso, Norway, and Martyn P. Chipperfield of Cambridge University 
in England studied the northern ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
	``In particular, if Arctic (ozone) depletion persists later in  
the year, as in 1997, more UV will penetrate to the surface when 
the sun is higher in the sky in late spring and summer,'' 
Chipperfield said in an interview via electronic mail. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is the possibility that the Arctic may becoming more  
Antarctic-like,'' he said. ``Certainly 1997 was nearer than other 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Chipperfield added, ``the winter polar vortex in the  
Arctic is very variable, and last year (1997-98) the vortex was 
warm, weak and there was little ozone loss. It is too soon to 
detect a definite trend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hansen and Chipperfield, using data collected from the Norwegian  
island of Andoya, reported that in 1995-1996 and 1996-1997, overall 
ozone depletion reached a maximum of 48 percent below the long-term 
average and up to 60 percent at the most affected altitude, 12 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
	And the 1996-1997 vortex lasted exceptionally long, into early  
May, extending the period of reduced ozone levels. This led in turn 
to increased ultraviolet radiation in northern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Reductions in the northern ozone layer have also been reported  
by scientists at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration and National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

<HEADLINE> Conn. Cop Charged With Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITCHFIELD, Conn. (AP) -- A police officer was charged with  
murder Tuesday for allegedly shooting an unarmed suspect in the 
back at point-blank range while the man was on his knees. 
</P>
<P>
	New Milford officer Scott B. Smith, who has been a police  
officer for less than two years, was arraigned and released on 
$250,000 bond. If convicted of murder in the death of Franklyn 
Reid, 27, who was shot after a foot chase Dec. 29, he would face a 
mandatory sentence of 25 years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's lawyer, Thomas Allingham, has described the shooting as  
``tragic, but justified.'' He said Smith will plead not guilty. He 
declined to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement to investigators, Smith said he could not see  
Reid's hands, and that Reid had made a sudden motion, as if turning 
with a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believed at the time he was either going to shoot me or stab  
me,'' Smith said. ``Out of fear for my life at that instant, I 
discharged my weapon one time, striking Mr. Reid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reid didn't have a weapon at the time.  
</P>
<P>
	``Witnesses do indicate that at some point in time, that from  
their perspective ... Mr. Reid had given up, had surrendered,'' 
said Waterbury state's Attorney John A. Connelly. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's partner, who was in a car a short distance away, told  
investigators Smith had taken hold of Reid and was trying to 
control him. Neither he nor any other witness saw the gun being 
fired, Connelly said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid was wanted on charges of violating probation, six counts of  
telephone harassment and three charges of failure to appear in 
court. His criminal record included convictions on assault and 
sexual assault charges, Connelly said.

<HEADLINE> Court To Take State Water Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to resolve a  
dispute between Kansas and Nebraska over the use of water from the 
Republican River. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices allowed Kansas to ``sue'' Nebraska in the nation's  
highest court without first having the dispute heard in any other 
court. The court on occasion invokes such ``original jurisdiction'' 
and serves as a trial court in disputes between states. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution of such cases usually takes years. The court  
likely will appoint a ``special master'' to conduct hearings and 
collect evidence for them. 
</P>
<P>
	In the complaint acted on today, Kansas lawyers accused Nebraska  
of violating a 1943 interstate compact by allowing Nebraskans to 
divert more than their legal share of the river's water for their 
private use. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska's lawyers responded by contending no such breach of the  
compact occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked by the court in October for its views, the Clinton  
administration last month filed a brief urging the Kansas request 
be granted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kansas alleges an interstate dispute of sufficient importance  
... and there is no other forum in which the controversy 
practicably can be resolved,'' Justice Department lawyers said. 
They urged the court to first decide the scope of the 1943 compact 
before referring the case to a special master. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican is a tributary of the Kansas River, which joins  
the Missouri at Kansas City. The waters of the Republican and its 
tributaries are impounded by the Harlan County Dam for flood 
control and irrigation purposes in both states. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Kansas said Nebraska breached the Republican River  
Compact ``by allowing the proliferation and use of thousands of 
wells hydraulically connected to the Republican River and its 
tributaries, by the failure to protect surface flows and from 
unauthorized appropriation by Nebraska users.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such activities ``have deprived the state of Kansas of its full  
entitlement,'' the complaint said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska's lawyers argued that groundwater use is not regulated  
by the compact. In any event, they said, Kansas has received ``its 
full allocation of Republican River water (and more) every year 
with the exception of 1992'' -- a drought year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kansas complaint also named Colorado as a defendant but  
sought damages only from Nebraska. Colorado was named apparently 
because the Republican River partially originates in that state. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Kansas vs. Nebraska, 126 Original.

<HEADLINE> Day Runner Inc. Lays Off 350 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVINE, Calif. (AP) -- Day Runner Inc., a maker of organizers,  
address books and business accessories, is eliminating 20 percent 
of its jobs in an effort to cope with lower-than-expected sales.

profit plunged 48 percent in the second quarter of its fiscal year. 
Day Runner also said it was re-evaluating planned capital 
expenditures and looking for other areas to save money. 
</P>
<P>
	Profits for the quarter ended Dec. 31 were $2.9 million, or 23  
cents a diluted share, down from $5.5 million, or 45 cents a share, 
a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose 31 percent as a result of the company's acquisition  
of Filofax. Revenue climbed to $64.6 million from $49.4 million.

<HEADLINE> Marketing Push Targets Minorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Activists are succeeding in getting America's  
largest companies to begin making financial commitments for 
contracts and advertising targeting increasingly lucrative minority 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The drive was evident Monday as some leading advertisers met  
with community organizations and activists on Martin Luther King 
Jr. Day and disclosed increased investments in marketing to 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Pepsi-Cola, for example, expects to spend 10 percent to 15  
percent more this year on advertising on black radio stations and 
up to 50 percent more on ethnic newspapers, said Rick Rock, a 
marketing vice president at the unit of PepsiCo Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Advertising Age is hiring an editor and a reporter to focus on  
multicultural areas and the weekly will cover the topic at least 
every other week for six months, said Edward R. Erhardt, the 
publisher of the trade magazine. He also said the magazine is 
aggressively pursuing advertising targeting ethnic markets. 
</P>
<P>
	These companies are making ``these types of efforts at this time  
has everything to do with the non-white population, 
African-Americans in particular, representing the last big consumer 
opportunity for corporate America,'' said Ken Smikle, president and 
founder of Chicago-based Target Market News Inc., which collects 
and interprets economic data concerning African-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Presenters at the meeting at the posh Waldorf-Astoria hotel kept  
getting back to the purchasing clout of America's minorities. 
Blacks, Latinos and Asians generate a combined consuming power 
totaling about $1 trillion, yet ethnic radio stations, newspapers 
and magazines receive a small portion, if any, of advertising 
budgets to target those communities. 
</P>
<P>
	A study released last week by the Federal Communications  
Commission found disparities in the ad dollars radio stations 
receive, with minority-formatted stations with high ratings getting 
far less of the advertising revenue in their markets than stations 
ranked lower. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Al Sharpton, who has been targeting companies and  
advertisers to pay more attention to minority marketing, was among 
the organizers of Monday's meeting. Sharpton stepped up pressure on 
Madison Avenue last year after an ad agency's memo advised clients 
that ``advertisers want prospects, not suspects'' and proposed ad 
budgets be devoted to reaching ``the more important `white' segment 
of the population.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not just advertisers who are paying more attention to  
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	At a two-day Wall Street Project conference last week organized  
by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, AT&AMP;T Corp. announced it was going to 
sell $1 billion in bonds through an offering co-managed by a 
minority firm. It said an additional $200 million to $300 million 
in debt would be entirely managed by ``diversity firms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other companies made announcements that minority firms would  
manage funds worth $50 million to $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, Sharpton said that while he was pleased more companies  
were represented at the advertising conference than expected, he 
was going to call on those that didn't show up. He also said that 
he expected a long-time commitment from advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a one-night stand at the Hotel Waldorf. This is a  
marriage,'' Sharpton told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	As the conference wound down, Clarence O. Smith, president of  
Essence Communications and Latina magazine, put it another way, 
saying that the purpose of this first-ever summit was ``to make 
sure meetings like this are not taking place 10 years from now.''

<HEADLINE> Texas' Muoneke Suspended One Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Gabe Muoneke, the Texas Longhorns' leading  
scorer, was suspended for one game Tuesday by coach Rick Barnes for 
throwing punches in Monday night's 76-67 loss to No. 19 Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Muoneke was not charged with any fouls for fighting, and Barnes  
said neither he nor the game officials saw any of the incidents 
during the game. 
</P>
<P>
	But television replays of the game, which was carried by ESPN,  
showed Muoneke punching Kansas' Nick Bradford in the first half and 
T.J. Pugh in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had known it happened during the game, I would have taken  
him out,'' Barnes said. 
</P>
<P>
	It is Muoneke's second punching incident this season. Barnes  
made Muoneke write a letter of apology to Wisconsin guard Hennssy 
Auriantal after Muoneke punched him in the stomach during a game in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes, in his first year at Texas, threatened Muoneke with  
suspension if the first incident was repeated. The coach said 
Tuesday that the school will provide Muoneke with anger counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate what he's done, but I know Gabe's a wonderful person.  
He can still be aggressive and play as hard as he can play, but he 
can't cross that line,'' Barnes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes and Muoneke addressed reporters at a news conference.  
Muoneke said he was ``embarrassed and ashamed'' by the incident and 
apologized to Kansas coach Roy Williams after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Muoneke said he welcomes the chance for counseling, which will  
start as early as Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's an on-the-court problem that if it's not taken  
care of, it could spill over,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A 6-foot-7, 250-pound junior forward, Muoneke leads Texas with  
16.7 points per game and is third in rebounds per game with 6.3. 
His suspension leaves Texas (9-9, 5-1 Big 12) with only six 
scholarship players for Saturday's game at home against No. 23 
Oklahoma State. 
</P>
<P>
	The one-game suspension is similar to what Muoneke would have  
faced had he been thrown out of Monday's game for fighting, Barnes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Big 12 Conference commissioner Kevin Weiberg said the league is  
satisfied with the one-game suspension and no further punishment is 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Muoneke said opposing players around the league probably think  
he is a dirty player. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't done anything to make anybody proud,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think some think I'm a thug, some hate me, some think I'm  
funny. I don't think anybody thinks of me as a basketball player 
right now.''

<HEADLINE> Shaw Interviews for Browns Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Willie Shaw finally got a chance to tell the  
Browns his story, then had to listen as Cleveland president Carmen 
Policy explained Brian Billick's. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw, the defensive coordinator for the Oakland Raiders, became  
the latest head coaching candidate to formally interview with 
Policy for the Browns job Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw's meeting came with Policy came one day after Billick was  
surprisingly dropped as a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt the fit wasn't right, the chemistry wasn't right,''  
Policy said of Billick, who was named head coach of the Baltimore 
Ravens on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Billick, the former offensive coordinator for the Minnesota  
Vikings, had been considered the frontrunner for the Browns' 
position after a strong interview with Policy last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the Vikings' home loss in the NFC championship game on  
Sunday to Atlanta, Cleveland football operations director Dwight 
Clark flew to Minnesota to meet with Billick. Policy said Clark 
wasn't sent to offer Billick a contract, but to continue the 
``interview process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Policy said Billick indicated to Clark that he was still  
interested in pursuing other opportunities, and that was all Policy 
needed to hear. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is our feeling that the first coach of this Cleveland  
Browns organization should be an individual who feels very 
passionately about coming to Cleveland,'' Policy said. ``He should 
feel that this is a unique opportunity, it's not just a job. He 
should feel that this is the best opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not in terms of money, but in terms of that opportunity to go  
forward and build and create. If a candidate doesn't have that 
feeling, I don't think they're going to fit here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the expansion draft three weeks away, Policy is running out  
of time and head coaching candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Billick and Denver offensive coordinator Gary Kubiak, who Monday  
said he was staying with the Broncos, are both off the board. That 
leaves Shaw, Atlanta offensive line coach Art Shell and 
Jacksonville offensive coordinator Chris Palmer as the only coaches 
who have formally met with Policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Policy said the Browns won't announce any more coaching  
interviews but the search could extend into the college ranks. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw, 55, was the first defensive coach to meet with Policy, who  
said in the past he preferred an ``offensive-minded coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Policy changed his mind after seeing Shaw on a videotape  
distributed by the NFL to help minority coaching candidates get 
interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw, who has spent 12 years as an NFL assistant, joined the  
Raiders before the 1998 season and transformed Oakland's defense 
from one of the league's worst to one of its best.

<HEADLINE> Japan Bankruptcies Up 17.1 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's severe recession caused corporate  
bankruptcies to soar 17.1 percent to 19,171 cases in 1998, the 
second highest level since World War II, a private credit research 
company said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Debt left behind by collapsed companies rose 2.6 percent to $126  
billion, the highest since 1945, said The Teikoku Databank Ltd. The 
previous record of $125 billion was set in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The most bankruptcy cases in a year occurred in 1984, when  
20,841 companies went out of business amid a restructuring of 
industry as Japan's phenomenal postwar growth rates abated. 
</P>
<P>
	The country's severe economic slump took its toll across the  
business spectrum, as bankruptcies increased at double-digit 
percentage rates in all sectors last year. Companies were hurt by 
plunging prices and the severe credit crunch in the banking sector, 
which is staggering under massive soured debts. 
</P>
<P>
	Failures in the construction industry exceeded 5,000 cases for  
the first time in 13 years, and failures in manufacturing topped 
3,000 for the first time in 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	On the bright side, the number of bankruptcies trailed off  
toward the end of the year, with corporate collapses falling in 
December for the second straight month. 
</P>
<P>
	December bankruptcies dropped 26.6 percent from a year earlier  
to 1,169 cases, while bankruptcy debt dropped 59.7 percent to $97.5 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, the number of company failures fell 4.6 percent to  
1,360 cases for the first decline in 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Teikoku said small company bankruptcies fell sharply in December  
after the government instituted new programs to help smaller 
companies get loans. 
</P>
<P>
	But it said bankruptcies of medium-sized companies continued to  
rise, and that overall business conditions remained extremely 
harsh.

<HEADLINE> White House Opens Clinton Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- White House Counsel Charles Ruff told the  
Senate impeachment trial today that President Clinton was innocent 
of the charges lodged against him and ``must not be removed from 
office.'' He opened Clinton's defense by attacking the House 
prosecutors' case as a ``witches' brew of charges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff, an imposing figure in Washington legal circles for two  
decades, sharply attacked the conclusions and motives of the 13 
House prosecutors who laid out their evidence last week. He called 
their effort ``nothing more than a rush to judgment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House Republicans who approved two article of impeachment  
alleging Clinton lied under oath and obstructed justice were 
``convinced by their own rhetoric'' and failed to ``explore the 
constitutional underpinnings of that duty,'' Ruff argued in a calm, 
matter-of-fact presentation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps they understood that a full and candid exploration  
would reveal that the proposed articles had no constitutional 
underpinnings at all,'' he said in the sharpest attack yet on the 
Republicans' work. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have, in essence, treated these articles as empty vessels  
to be filled with some witches' brew of charges,'' Ruff said. 
</P>
<P>
	He gave an unyielding defense of the president just hours before  
Clinton was to deliver the State of the Union Address before the 
same lawmakers that impeached him. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is not a court anywhere, highest to lowest, that would  
hesitate, if they were confronted with an indictment written like 
these articles, to throw it out,'' Ruff said, glancing toward the 
table where the House prosecutors sat. 
</P>
<P>
	``William Jefferson Clinton is not guilty of the charges,'' he  
declared. ``He did not commit perjury. He did not obstruct justice. 
He must not be removed from office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Delving into the evidence used to charge Clinton with perjury,  
Ruff dismissed discrepancies between the sworn accounts of Monica 
Lewinsky and the president. He said the Supreme Court has ruled 
that a perjury conviction cannot be sustained with ``equally honest 
witnesses who may well have different recollections of the same 
events.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House made a tactical shift today and added some  
congressional Democrats to the defense team to bolster arguments 
that his impeachment was handled in a ``very partisan way,'' Press 
Secretary Joe Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity,  
said the White House was interested in having Reps. John Conyers of 
Michigan, Rick Boucher of Virginia and Tom Barrett of Wisconsin 
join the team. But Boucher declined the invitation, citing schedule 
conflicts. The lawmakers would speak before the Senate as part of 
the president's defense. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate's Republican leader rejected Democratic suggestions  
that calling witnesses later in the trial would turn the proceeding 
into a lurid show. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it should lead to an unseemly spectacle. You  
don't have to get into the details,'' said Majority Leader Trent 
Lott. He said he hadn't made a final decision on recommending 
witnesses, calling it ``premature'' to do so before the White House 
made its opening arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff, who works from a wheelchair, sat in the well of the Senate  
with a glass of water, plain sheet of paper and a book at his side 
and a microphone clipped to his lapel. He kept the rapt attention 
of senators -- Lott, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch 
and House prosecutor Asa Hutchinson were among those who took 
copious notes. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the onlookers in nearly full Senate galleries were actress  
Whoopi Goldberg and actor Frank Langella. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff, the last of the Watergate prosecutors, read comments made  
by Republicans in 1974 when the removal of Richard Nixon from 
office was weighed. He argued that even if the offenses against 
Clinton were proven, they would not meet the standard intended by 
the Founding Fathers for removing a president for high crimes and 
misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The framers set an extraordinarily high level,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The chief White House lawyer also took aim at the woman whose  
secret recordings prompted the crisis. He said Linda Tripp ``was 
able to play'' an ``oddly multifaceted role'' to assist both Paula 
Jones' lawyers and Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's 
investigation at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	He questioned why Starr had not prevented Mrs. Tripp, a  
cooperating witness in his investigation, from aiding the Jones 
lawyers. Starr's office ``inexplicably chose not to,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tracking Clinton's troubles back to the Jones sexual harassment  
lawsuit, he attacked the motives of the Arkansas woman's lawyers in 
seeking to uncover evidence of other Clinton relationships. That 
effort led to the discovery of Ms. Lewinsky and the president's 
illicit affair. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the evidence digging was done ``clearly with only one  
purpose: to embarrass the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House team also was to focus on conflicts in testimony  
gathered by Starr, a shift in strategy aimed at undercutting House 
charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	This will be the second year that Clinton's State of the Union  
address has been clouded by charges of marital infidelities. He 
presented his 1998 speech a few days after the Lewinsky story was 
made public. 
</P>
<P>
	At his trial, meanwhile, the switch from not discussing the  
facts to disputing many of them could bolster Republican demands 
for witnesses to help resolve the disputes. The White House has 
been fighting that prospect but now expects witnesses, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, John Podesta, the White House chief of staff, said  
today there is no assurance that witnesses could resolve whatever 
conflicts might exist in testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think after our defense team has put down the case on the  
facts, the law and the Constitution, have reminded the senators 
there are 60,000 pages of testimony from over 100 witnesses that 
are before them already, they may find there is no need for 
witnesses,'' Podesta said on NBC's ``Today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Clinton's lawyers conclude their arguments, he said, they  
will move to dismiss the charges.

<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Pittsburgh's favorite Jewish grandmother has  
found a new career: pitchwoman for bagels and milk. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Mayor Sophie Masloff is on television and billboards  
hawking Bruegger's Bagels and Schneider's Dairy's 64-ounce Mighty 
Mouth milk carton with the screw-off top. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm no movie star. I'm a long way from being, how should I

Monday. ``And then my voice is squeaky and recognizable, but 
certainly not desirable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Masloff served as mayor from 1988 to 1994, referring to herself  
as Pittsburgh's favorite Jewish grandmother. She was famous for 
such malaprops as referring to Bruce Springsteen as Bruce 
``Bedspring.''

<HEADLINE> Six Players in Arbitration Settle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Even before the exchange of salary arbitration  
figures, players and clubs have been scrambling to settle their 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Helling and Hideo Nomo are among the six who have agreed to  
contracts. Among the 62 players who filed for arbitration Friday, 
53 were still set today to exchange figures with their teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Helling, who won 20 games to tie Roger Clemens and David Cone  
for the American League lead, agreed Monday to a $10.5 million, 
three-year contract with the Texas Rangers, a steep increase from 
his $216,500 salary last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo, traded to the New York Mets by Los Angeles last June, got  
a one-year deal worth $2,925,000, a raise of $125,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Also settling Monday were St. Louis reliever Ricky Bottalico  
($2.25 million), Boston outfielder Damon Buford ($1.1 million), 
Chicago White Sox right-hander Bill Simas ($1.1 million) and 
Anaheim right-hander Mark Petkovsek ($800,000). 
</P>
<P>
	Among the top names scheduled to swap salary arbitration figures  
today were Andy Pettitte and Mariano Rivera of the New York 
Yankees, Aaron Sele of the Rangers, Carlos Delgado of the Toronto 
Blue Jays and Charles Johnson of the Baltimore Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	Delgado, according to several player and management sources, was  
contemplating asking for $9 million or more. The record asking 
price of $9 million was set last year by New York Yankees 
outfielder Bernie Williams, who settled at $8.25 million and agreed 
after the season to an $87.5 million, seven-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Delgado, a first baseman, made $2.4 million last year, when he  
hit .292 with 38 homers and 115 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Players who don't settle will be scheduled for arbitration  
hearings during the first three weeks of February, but fewer than 
10 cases are expected to go to hearings. This year, 75 percent of 
the cases will be scheduled before three-man panels rather than 
individual arbitrators. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati pitcher Jason Bere ($1.2 million) settled immediately  
after filing Friday. Settling over the weekend were San Diego 
right-hander Dan Miceli ($4.6 million for three years) and Houston 
right-hander Jose Lima ($1.95 million). 
</P>
<P>
	Helling, who went 20-7 with a 4.41 ERA in 33 starts, will make  
$2.25 million in 1999, $3.75 million in 2000, and $4.5 million in 
2001. He has less than three years of major league service but 
qualified as a ``Super Two,'' one of the dozen of so players each 
year with 2-3 years of service who became eligible under the 1990 
lockout settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``My wife and I felt it was a good deal and we're happy with the  
confidence the Rangers showed in us for the long term,'' Helling 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo, the 1995 NL Rookie of the Year, was 4-5 with a 5.04 ERA  
for the Mets and 6-12 with a 4.92 ERA overall. He struck out 167 
and walked 94 in 157 1-3 innings, allowing 130 hits. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are looking for Hideo to have a comeback year,'' Mets  
general manager Steve Phillips said. ``His stuff was great last 
season. If he can cut down on his walks, which we think he can, 
there is no doubt in my mind he can again become one of the top 
starting pitchers in the National League.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among free agents, Toronto agreed to a $500,000, one-year  
contract with second baseman Joey Cora and a one-year deal with 
third baseman Willie Greene.

<HEADLINE> Attorneys General Look Into Boxing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The state attorney general knows there are  
several areas to look into when it comes to placing blame for the 
current state of boxing. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's enough blame to go around,'' said Elliott Spitzer, who  
appeared Tuesday at the opening of three days of public hearings by 
the National Association of Attorney Generals Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
	The group's purpose is to try to help boxers in the areas of  
contracts, purses and safety to the point of pushing for national 
legislation. But Spitzer also said boxers sometimes create their 
own problems. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, Sen. John McCain of Arizona mustered enough support  
to pass a law mandating modest safety reforms in boxing, including 
the introduction of identification cards that keep suspended or 
injured fighters from returning to the ring in other states, or 
under assumed names. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're doing is putting together a collection of attorney  
generals plus, and we hope to have the whole country,'' Spitzer 
said of task force. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to apply pressure to the people who make the big money  
-- the networks, promoters and sanctioning bodies. One relationship 
that is suspect is the one between promoters and sanctioning 
bodies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spitzer, New York's newly-elected attorney general, said one  
thing that must be done is to make sure boxers get fair contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	``They see riches and they sign on the dotted line and do not  
know what they're signing,'' Spitzer said. ``It's time we seen 
uniformity of contracts and disclosure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The task force wants to open the business and governing of  
boxing to public scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	``One way is to have professional standards,'' said Spitzer,  
adding, however, that he does not want to see the creation of 
federal bureaucracy to govern the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives of TV networks and governing bodies, promoters.  
lawyers, managers and boxers were to appear during the three days 
of hearings.

<HEADLINE>  Money Holds Up Cuba-Orioles Series </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Money appears to be the main obstacle to an  
exhibition baseball series between the Baltimore Orioles and a 
Cuban all-star team. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives for Cuba and major league baseball were unable  
to reach an agreement Tuesday before Orioles owner Peter Angelos 
returned home. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos and Raul Villanueva, president of the Cuban Sports  
Institute, refused to identify the stumbling blocks. But sources 
close to the talks, who requested anonymity, said the two sides 
could not agree on how proceeds from the exhibition games would be 
used. 
</P>
<P>
	If the sides agree, the first exhibition game would be March 28  
at Havana's Latinoamericano Stadium. The second would be April 3 at 
Camden Yards in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good thing is that Cuba and the United States are very  
close,'' Angelos said of future negotiations. ``If it is necessary 
for one of us to come back and meet with chairman Villanueva we 
will be here very quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos said he is optimistic the two sides will come to an  
understanding. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal remains two games,'' he said. ``Hopefully, after  
those two there will be many more games between the Cuban team and 
other major leagues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubans appeared more pessimistic.  
</P>
<P>
	In a statement released Tuesday night by the Center for  
International Press, the government reiterated its requirement that 
the proceeds go to hurricane victims in Central America ``attended 
by Cuban doctors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Cuba will not renounce this just and noble requirement even if  
none of the games are played,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	It also criticized the American delegation for ``proposing the  
destination, distribution and form'' of the proceeds. The United 
States wants the proceeds go to Caritas, the Cuban counterpart of 
Catholic Relief Services. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos and the rest of the 12-member delegation, which arrived  
in Havana last Friday, attended a Sunday game at Latinoamericano 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	B.J. Surhoff of the Baltimore Orioles; Sandy Alderson, executive  
vice president of baseball operations for major league baseball; 
and Tony Bernazard, special assistant to the executive director of 
the players' union, were among those who returned to the stadium 
Monday to walk the field and measure distances. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came away very satisfied with the field and look forward to  
playing the Cubans there,'' Angelos said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides issued a joint statement saying they have agreed  
on dates, locations, starting times and umpires for the games. They 
also agreed that both sides would use wooden bats, even though 
Cuban players are accustomed to aluminum ones. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the statement added: ``There are important areas which  
are unresolved at this time but which will remain the subject of 
continuing discussions in the days ahead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Major league baseball and the players' union insist that the  
Cuban stadium have padding on the outfield fences. If the padding 
cannot be brought in from the United States -- the trade embargo 
against Cuba prohibits that -- it would have to be imported from 
Japan at a cost of about $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said this month he would let the Orioles play  
a Cuban team as part of a plan to increase relations between the 
American and Cuban people. 
</P>
<P>
	No major league team has played in Cuba since the Brooklyn  
Dodgers held spring training in Havana in 1947.

<HEADLINE> St. Louis Residents Eye Pope Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mark McGwire has nothing on the pope.  
</P>
<P>
	The frenzy over the march by the St. Louis Cardinals slugger to  
a record 70 home runs last fall pales in comparison to the 
excitement over the city's first papal visit. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimates call for 600,000 people to gather for the Jan. 26-27  
visit. If the weather behaves -- a big question for the end of 
January in St. Louis -- that number could easily rise to one 
million, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm guessing the crowd will be very, very large, if the  
weather is decent,'' Monsignor Richard Stika, event coordinator for 
the St. Louis Archdiocese, said Monday. ``We are so centrally 
located.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the peak of McGwire mania, there were crowds of 50,000  
downtown and about 700 out-of-town media. This time, more than 
2,000 media representatives are expected to attend Pope John Paul 
II's visit. 
</P>
<P>
	Nuns from three convents have been asked to pray for fair skies  
and warmer temperatures -- some divine aid in a city where snow and 
ice still cover lawns and many sidewalks a week before the 
pontiff's arrival. 
</P>
<P>
	Hotel rooms were long ago snapped up and tour bus operators  
across the Midwest say they're booked solid. The nearest available 
bus for hire is hundreds of miles away in Dallas, operators said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly all of downtown St. Louis' streets have been re-paved and  
powerful lights are being set up to make the Gateway Arch glimmer 
at night. Thousands of banners welcoming the pope have been 
hoisted. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the smallest things have been accounted for. Nuns have  
baked 131,000 tiny hosts for the more than 100,000 Roman Catholics 
expected to jam the Trans World Dome to capacity for Mass on Jan. 
27. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, with time running out, there are so many things to do.  
</P>
<P>
	Workers are still stringing about 10 miles of plastic fencing  
along the parade routes the pope will travel in his popemobile. An 
extra 700 police officers are coming to help St. Louis police 
provide security and crowd control. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Kennebeck's crew is putting the finishing touches on a  
massive white oak altar built for the occasion. His company, which 
builds high-end executive offices and board rooms, is taking extra 
care. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe the guys are taking just a little bit more time on this,  
giving it a little more attention to detail,'' said Kennebeck. 
``It's a chance of a lifetime for all of us. How many people can 
say they built an altar used by the Holy Father?''

	Clinton: Boost Social Security Fund  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will propose in his State of  
the Union address tonight to use most of the government budget 
surplus to bolster Social Security and create new 401(k)-style 
retirement accounts for most American workers. The president also 
will propose using some of the surplus money to support the ailing 
Medicare system, and spending another 11 percent for military and 
other domestic programs. Clinton's proposal includes no income tax 
cuts and thus is certain to set up conflicts with many Republicans 
who want the budget surplus spent, at least in part, to reduce 
taxes. 

</P>
<P>
	Dunn, Largent To Give GOP Response  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two House Republicans who tried unsuccessfully  
to unseat their majority leader will deliver the GOP response to 
President Clinton's State of the Union address tonight. Rep. 
Jennifer Dunn of Washington will focus on tax relief and Social 
Security reform. Rep. Steve Largent of Oklahoma will discuss 
education and national defense. Their remarks are expected to be 
broadcast by major TV networks beginning at about 10:30 p.m. EST. 
Dunn and Largent lost their bids to topple House Majority Leader 
Richard Armey, R-Texas, in a caucus election in November. 

</P>
<P>
	White House To Open Clinton Defense  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- White House lawyers are preparing an  
aggressive defense of President Clinton today as they get their 
chance in the president's Senate trial. The defense team is 
expected to focus on conflicts in testimony gathered by Independent 
Counsel Kenneth Starr, a shift in strategy aimed at undercutting 
House charges of perjury and obstruction of justice, sources say. 
The switch from not discussing the facts to disputing many of them 
could bolster Republican demands for witnesses to help resolve the 
disputes. The White House has been fighting that prospect but now 
expects witnesses, officials said.

	NATO Generals Warn Yugo Leader  
</P>
<P>
	PETROVO, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Two top NATO generals today arrived  
in Yugoslavia and warned President Slobodan Milosevic to end 
assaults on ethnic Albanians or face possible alliance military 
strikes. Serb forces, meanwhile, bombarded the hills surrounding a 
village where 45 civilians were massacred, ignoring demands by NATO 
and the United States to honor a three-month-old cease-fire. 
Yugoslavian officials yesterday ordered the American head of a 
peace verifying mission to leave the country and barred the chief 
of a U.N. war crimes tribunal from investigating the massacre site. 

</P>
<P>
	Congo Rebels Say Peace Not in Sight  
</P>
<P>
	GOMA, Congo (AP) -- Congolese rebels who have been trying to  
topple President Laurent Kabila for five months said today that 
they would not lay down their arms until Kabila meets them at the 
negotiating table. The rebels said they would pay little heed to a 
cease-fire commitment reached by five African nations that have 
sent troops into Congo to fight either for or against Kabila. 
Troops from Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad have joined Kabila, 
while Rwanda and Uganda support the rebels. Congolese rebels accuse 
Kabila of being in league with thousands of Rwandan and Ugandan 
rebels.

	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Jordan's King Hussein returned home today  
following six months of cancer treatment at the Mayo Clinic in the 
United States. Government officials say Hussein, 63, has fully 
recovered following six months of treatment for non-Hodgkins 
lymphoma at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. The absence was his 
longest from the kingdom he has ruled for 46 years. He has spent 
the past two weeks recuperating in Britain.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- High-speed Internet provider At Home is buying  
World Wide Web search engine Excite for about $6.7 billion in stock 
in one of the largest Internet company deals ever. The deal would 
surpass America Online's $4.2 billion acquisition of Netscape last 
year. The deal could eventually give AT&AMP;T control of one of the 
highly sought-after portals that serve as entry points onto the 
Internet. Excite has been looking for a larger partner.

decliners 937-629. The Nasdaq was up 44.22 to 2,392.42.

	Report: Walsh To Become 49ers GM  
</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Bill Walsh will return to the San Francisco  
49ers next season as general manager, ABC Sports Radio reported 
today. Walsh led the 49ers to three Super Bowl titles. Walsh is 
expected to help in personnel evaluation and oversee the draft. The 
team last week fired its director of player personnel, Vinny 
Cerrato. John McVay has been acting as interim GM.

<HEADLINE>  Cuba, Orioles Can't Agree on Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- They have the dates, the bats and the ballparks.  
</P>
<P>
	What the Cubans and the Baltimore Orioles do not have just yet  
is a deal on an exhibition baseball series -- and money appears to 
be the obstacle. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives for Cuba and major league baseball were unable  
to reach an agreement Tuesday before Orioles owner Peter Angelos 
returned home. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos and Raul Villanueva, president of the Cuban Sports  
Institute, refused to identify the stumbling blocks. But sources 
close to the talks, who requested anonymity, said the two sides 
could not agree on how proceeds from the exhibition games would be 
used. 
</P>
<P>
	If the sides agree, the first exhibition game would be March 28  
at Havana's Latinoamericano Stadium between a Cuban all-star team 
and the Orioles. The second would be April 3 between the same teams 
at Camden Yards in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good thing is that Cuba and the United States are very  
close,'' Angelos said of future negotiations. ``If it is necessary 
for one of us to come back and meet with chairman Villanueva we 
will be here very quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos said he is optimistic the two sides will come to an  
understanding. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal remains two games,'' he said. ``Hopefully, after  
those two there will be many more games between the Cuban team and 
other major leagues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubans appeared more pessimistic.  
</P>
<P>
	In a communique released Tuesday night by the Center for  
International Press, the government reiterated its requirement that 
the proceeds go to hurricane victims in Central America ``attended 
by Cuban doctors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Cuba will not renounce this just and noble requirement even if  
none of the games are played,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	It also criticized the American delegation for ``proposing the  
destination, distribution and form'' of the proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos and the rest of the 12-member delegation, which arrived  
in Havana last Friday, attended a Sunday game at Latinoamericano 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	B.J. Surhoff of the Baltimore Orioles; Sandy Alderson, executive  
vice president of baseball operations for major league baseball; 
and Tony Bernazard, special assistant to the executive director of 
the players' union, were among those who returned to the stadium 
Monday to walk the field and measure distances. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came away very satisfied with the field and look forward to  
playing the Cubans there,'' Angelos said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a field very capable of hosting a game like this,''  
Surhoff added. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos said the Orioles would field a ``first-rate'' lineup for  
the games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It won't be minor league,'' he said. ``We have respect for the  
Cuban team and we'll have our work cut out for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibition games, first proposed in 1996, were earlier  
rejected by the State Department because of the trade embargo that 
has been in place for three decades. No major league team has 
played in Cuba since the Brooklyn Dodgers held spring training in 
Havana in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides issued a joint statement and said they have agreed  
on a number areas: dates, locations, starting times, umpires and 
visas. Both sides would use wooden bats; Cuban baseball players are 
accustomed to aluminum ones. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the statement added: ``There are important areas which  
are unresolved at this time but which will remain the subject of 
continuing discussions in the days ahead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Major league baseball and the players' union insist that the  
Cuban stadium have padding on the outfield fences. If the padding 
cannot be brought in from the United States -- the trade embargo 
prohibits that -- it would have to be imported from Japan at a cost 
of about dlrs 400,000. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said this month he would let the Orioles play  
a Cuban team as part of a plan to increase relations between the 
American and Cuban people while maintaining the U.S. economic 
embargo against the communist nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan would let more Americans send money to Cubans, offer  
direct mail service between the two countries and expand direct 
charter flights. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that the games have Clinton's backing, the State Department  
will require that any proceeds do not benefit the Cuban government. 
</P>
<P>
	The American preference is that any proceeds go to Catholic  
Relief Services' Cuban counterpart, Caritas. Tom Garofalo, director 
of charity efforts in Cuba by the Baltimore-based Catholic Relief 
Services, was among those in the delegation. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban authorities have said they would like to see the money  
benefit victims of Hurricane Mitch, which devastated a wide swath 
of Central America late last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that our prospects for a successful conclusion dictate  
that we don't get into the unresolved points,'' Angelos said before 
heading to the airport for the flight back to Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, there will be profits and that they will be put to  
good use,'' he said. ``But that's all I can say about that now.''

<HEADLINE>  Money Holds Up Cuba-Orioles Series </HEADLINE>

<HEADLINE> Senate Flooded With Mail on Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- ``Let's get on with the business of our  
lives,'' a constituent from Tacoma begs Sen. Slade Gorton of 
Washington. Across the country, a Rhode Islander implores Sen. John 
Chafee to ``be not the voice of compromise'' but vote to throw 
President Clinton out. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators are getting it both ways in the mail these weeks -- and  
how. The mailbags are bulging with everything except tepid 
indecision. 
</P>
<P>
	Missives are coming in by the thousands to Senate offices by  
regular mail, electronic mail and fax. True to the Senate's 
old-fashioned way of doing things, even the e-mail tends to get 
answered by old-fashioned paper, just as real people usually answer 
the phones. 
</P>
<P>
	A self-described elderly Episcopalian woman from Port Angeles,  
Wash., writes crisply that Clinton has done a good job in office. 
He should only be censured, she writes -- ``with a firm smack on 
those hands that fondled'' Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	And then there is this Dear Senator letter: ``You, sir, are in  
the position to begin to repair the long-term damage to our way of 
life that the Clinton Presidency has caused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letters make liberal use of that fine democratic flourish,  
the exclamation mark. Whole words come capitalized or underlined. 
Many senators in both parties report a rough 50-50 split for and 
against Clinton's removal, making the mails more hostile to the 
president than the nation overall. 
</P>
<P>
	The notes are brief, appealing for an end to this ``gruesome  
episode.'' Or, heartfelt musings on morality: ``It is true most 
people have made youthful indiscretions but most of us have mended 
our ways by the time we became responsible adults.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One constituent likens impeachment and conviction to throwing  
parents in jail, unsettling the children. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may hurt us for a while but that is not what the law is  
about,'' the constituent writes. ``But we do what is right even if 
people get hurt because the person who commits a crime has to be 
punished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Democratic Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina, a noted  
trial lawyer, is hearing from fellow attorneys who are parsing the 
legal implications of it all. ``Regular people kind of distill it 
to more basic things,'' says Josh Stein, chief of staff. ``Either, 
'We elected this man, this is a witch hunt,' or 'This man did 
something immoral''' and begone with him. 
</P>
<P>
	In many offices the flow rivals that seen before the 1991  
Persian Gulf War or when groups have organized mass mailings for 
abortion votes -- war and abortion being surefire magnets for a Dear 
Senator note. 
</P>
<P>
	Maine Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe may not have heard so much  
on any issue since she did battle against federal lobster 
restrictions, spokesman Dave Lackey says. Some 200 faxes alone 
await the staff each morning; more than 10,000 letters, e-mails and 
phone calls have come in since August. 
</P>
<P>
	In the office of Democratic Sen. John D. Rockefeller of West  
Virginia, aides find that when things are going sour for Clinton, 
the mail turns a bit sweeter for him. When he bounds back, more 
critics emerge. 
</P>
<P>
	That rings true for other senators, too. ``In the same way that  
ire drives mail, so does sympathy,'' says Nicholas Graham, speaking 
for Chafee. 
</P>
<P>
	Few aides would allow a peek into the mail. But Republican  
moderates Chafee and Gorton offered a cross-section with names 
blocked out. 
</P>
<P>
	In Chafee's office, the stack of constituent mail that is  
solidly pro-Clinton is 2 inches thick. So is the anti-Clinton mail. 
Mail wanting him censured but not removed, or something like that, 
is an inch thick. 
</P>
<P>
	``And here is our open-minded pile,'' said an aide, showing off  
the thinnest pickings of all. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, a few write merely to ask senators to do their best.  
</P>
<P>
	But not the constituent who told Chafee that if he votes to  
remove Clinton, ``I shall devote every breath in my body and every 
nickel in my pocket to the noble cause of ensuring your defeat the 
next time you run for re-election.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And that was from an admirer.

<HEADLINE> Court Won't Bar Fla. Electric Chair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Florida can keep the electric chair as its  
sole means of carrying out the death penalty because the Supreme 
Court rejected an appeal Tuesday that attacked electrocution as a 
cruel and outmoded way to carry out capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, in a brief order, turned away a convicted killer's  
arguments that death in the electric chair now offends ``evolving 
standards of decency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 38 states with death penalty laws, only four require  
execution by electrocution -- Florida, Alabama, Georgia and 
Nebraska. Two others, Tennessee and Kentucky, recently have 
provided for lethal injection as an alternate method. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida officials imposed a one-year moratorium on executions  
after a fire started during Pedro Medina's March 25, 1997, 
electrocution. Flames and smoke rose from a mask covering his head 
after the electric current was turned on in the 74-year-old 
electric chair. Executions have resumed. 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy report said Medina died instantly and had not  
suffered any pain from the fire, blamed on conducting sponges in 
the chair's headpiece. 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida Supreme Court voted 4-3, during the yearlong  
moratorium, that continued use of the electric chair would not 
violate the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment. 
That decision cited special rules -- a protocol -- state prison 
officials had adopted in the wake of Medina's execution. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Legislature voted last year to keep electrocution as  
the state's only means of execution. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the nation, states employ electrocution, lethal  
injection, hanging, firing squad and the gas chamber to execute 
their worst criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on Tuesday, lawyers for death row inmate  
Eduardo Lopez had contended that Florida ``continues to botch 
executions, fails to follow the protocol established after Mr. 
Medina was burned alive in the electric chair, and mutilates the 
bodies of condemned inmates in the electric chair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But state prosecutors urged the justices to reject Lopez's  
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing in this court's precedents suggests that a method of  
execution that does not involve the infliction of wanton or 
unnecessary pain ... can, or should, be rendered unconstitutional 
simply based upon the number of jurisdictions that do or do not 
allow it,'' they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lopez was sentenced to death for the 1983 murder of a young  
child during a Dade County house robbery.

<HEADLINE> Kan. Senate Prayer Called Political </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- A minister began the Kansas Senate's session  
Tuesday with a prayer that made reference to the impeachment 
scandal surrounding President Clinton, which angered some 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lord, we stand before you a nation in need with a president in  
need,'' said the Rev. Gene Price, pastor of the Word of Hope Church 
in Larned. ``I'm interceding to see the floodgates of deception, 
unfaithfulness, lies, broken oaths and covenants stopped; the 
example set by our highest office in the land.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prayer rankled some of Clinton's fellow Democrats in the  
chamber controlled by Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is wrong to use the guise of prayer to politicize  
the Senate,'' said Sen. Paul Feleciano, a Democrat from Wichita. 
``To attack the president of the United States or anyone else is 
wrong.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Warned on Social Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dozens of House Democrats are warning  
President Clinton they won't accept any attempt to replace Social 
Security's guaranteed benefits with new private retirement 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a letter to Clinton, the Democrats left room for an  
alternative: Using the budget surplus to subsidize new 401(k)-style 
accounts that people could manage themselves as an addition to -- 
but not a replacement for -- Social Security benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	That's something that has been considered by administration  
officials advising Clinton on what to say in his State of the Union 
address tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said Monday  
that he would reserve the number normally assigned to the year's 
first bill -- H.R. 1 -- for any reforms to the nation's retirement 
system that Clinton proposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wants to use his annual address to Congress to  
jump-start action to overhaul the nation's retirement program, but 
aides wouldn't say Monday just how explicit he would be. 
</P>
<P>
	Many congressional Democrats say they would prefer the president  
to avoid any specific policy endorsements in his speech tonight and 
to pursue bipartisan talks instead. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, a group of 44 House Democrats, plus independent  
Rep. Bernard Sanders of Vermont, took the precaution of telling 
Clinton in a recent letter: ``We are firmly united on one principle 
-- any Social Security privatization plan must be rejected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter was silent, however, on the possibility of  
supplemental accounts using government surpluses, not Social 
Security taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is something I would certainly consider,'' said Sanders,  
who composed the letter to Clinton along with Reps. Jerrold Nadler, 
D-N.Y., and Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Supplemental accounts wouldn't directly address the cash  
shortfall expected to face Social Security as the huge baby boom 
generation retires. But they could help Americans be better 
prepared for retirement and soften the blow of any changes to 
Social Security that might be necessary -- such as raising the 
eligibility age for benefits or limiting retirees' yearly 
cost-of-living raises. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also one option that Clinton could likely broach without  
upsetting lawmakers of either party. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have long advocated diverting some of the Social  
Security taxes now deducted from workers' paychecks into individual 
accounts Americans could invest in the stock market instead. 
Private investments would give most people a better bang for their 
buck than Social Security does, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Democrats strongly oppose moving money out of Social  
Security into such accounts, warning of increasing financial risks 
to individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Retirement benefits should be guaranteed, not subjected to the  
whims of the stock market,'' the House Democrats said in their 
letter. 
</P>
<P>
	However, House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri has  
said he could support supplemental accounts as long taxes earmarked 
for Social Security's guaranteed benefits aren't touched. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders, meanwhile, have already introduced  
legislation to use surpluses to start new retirement accounts -- 
holding open the possibility that some Social Security taxes could 
be transferred into them later. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am hopeful that this idea can be the basis for a bipartisan  
consensus solution to building a secure retirement for all 
Americans,'' Sen. William Roth, R-Del., chairman of the Senate 
Finance Committee, said in a separate letter to colleagues last 
week.

<HEADLINE> Gusty Storms Pound Midwest, East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEDFORD, Pa. (AP) -- Driven by powerful winds, snow and rain  
pounded the Midwest and Northeast, knocking out power to thousands 
of people and causing accidents from Illinois to New England. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could feel it, you could see it. It was like a hand just  
swept through the place,'' said Todd Erdos, who hid with two 
mechanics in the basement of the auto shop he manages near Bedford, 
115 miles east of Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	The Checkered Flag shop was a pile of collapsed ceiling beams,  
bent walls and scattered tools and insulation. The storms came 
Monday, a day after eight people were killed by tornadoes in 
Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Coast Guard officials were trying to determine if bad  
weather played a role in the apparent sinking of a 74-foot fishing 
boat off the waters of Barnegat Light, about 35 miles north of 
Atlantic City, N.J. Authorities were searching this morning for 
four crew members after The Adriatic failed to return to Atlantic 
City as scheduled Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Farther west, blowing snow caused whiteout conditions in  
Minnesota and Illinois, closing schools and causing a number of 
accidents. A bus of teen-agers on a ski trip collided with a 
jackknifed tractor-trailer on Interstate 74 west of Galesburg, 
Ill., injuring four people. 
</P>
<P>
	The storms knocked out power to at least 23,500 customers in  
Pennsylvania 24,000 in Connecticut and 18,000 in New Jersey. Rail 
service was also lost for two hours between New York and Delaware, 
stalling 20 trains and stranding hundreds of people at stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Sgt. John Mariano of the Port Authority of New York and New  
Jersey police said the weather backed up inbound flights to Newark 
International Airport by as much as six hours Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Winds, fog, the whole magilla,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	In south Philadelphia, a tree uprooted by the wind fell on a  
pregnant woman and trapped her for about 30 minutes. The woman, who 
was eight months pregnant, was taken to a hospital and listed in 
serious but stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just sitting at my desk, and I thought, `Wow, it's  
really nice out,''' said Janice Weyandt, who manages the Mile Level 
Market near Everett. ``Then it got black all of the sudden, like at 
the flick of a switch, faster than I've ever seen it, and it 
sounded like a train was coming through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Pittsburgh suburb of West Mifflin, the wind gust of 71  
mph was the highest reported across the country Monday, the 
National Weather Service said. The roof at a VFW post in Jamestown 
collapsed early Monday from the weight of snow and rain. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a total loss. Thankfully, it happened at night,'' post  
Commander Robert Hutton said. Friday's bingo was canceled.

	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- A 33-year-old woman accused of running a  
million-dollar-a-year call-girl ring in Detroit's well-to-do 
suburbs was sentenced to two years' probation after pleading guilty 
to racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
	Marci Devernay entered her plea Tuesday in exchange for the  
dismissal of five other counts related to the prostitution ring she 
allegedly ran out of her home. She could have gotten 20 years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, police released 7,000 names from her computerized  
little black book. After seizing the records, police were besieged 
with calls from curious wives and men offering excuses for why 
their names might be in there. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Devernay, dubbed the ``Huntington Woods Madam,'' ran an  
operation prosecutor Paul Walton called ``a 20th-century brothel 
with incidental acts of legitimate massage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walton asked Circuit Judge Deborah Tyner to put Ms. Devernay  
behind bars for one year. Defense attorney Richard Lustig said 
there was a tacit agreement with Oakland County Prosecutor David 
Gorcyca that Ms. Deverany wouldn't get jail time. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the names released last week, Huntington Woods  
police said there are another 7,000 names on Ms. Devernay's Rolodex 
and about 6,000 more in paper files that will be released later. 
</P>
<P>
	Police released the names and addresses on a CD-ROM after the  
Detroit Free Press and The Detroit News went to court to get the 
information.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wants Lower Trade Barriers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- To combat a rise of protectionism in the wake  
of the global financial crisis, the Clinton administration plans to 
push an ambitious agenda to lower trade barriers, including new 
trade talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials said Tuesday that the new round of  
talks, which could be called the Clinton Round, will be the key 
U.S. goal at a meeting of trade ministers from more than 120 
countries in December. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must tear down barriers, open markets and expand trade,''  
Clinton said in his State of the Union speech Tuesday night. At the 
same time, he warned Japan that if its steel exports ``are not 
reversed, America will respond.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said Clinton believes it is important to push ahead with  
trade liberalization in an effort to counter growing protectionist 
sentiment as nations struggle to cope with the 18-month global 
currency crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``This period of financial stress puts a lot of pressure on our  
trading partners to backtrack on reform and openness and the 
president sees a new round as keeping the momentum going for 
openness,'' said an administration official, who spoke on condition 
of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will need new trade negotiating authority from Congress.  
This authority, known as ``fast track'' because it requires 
Congress to consider any agreements on an expedited basis without 
the chance for amendments, has been a contentious issue for the 
past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has been blocked in efforts to win fast track  
authority because of determined opposition from environmental and 
labor groups who are insisting that any new trade agreements must 
include greater protections for worker rights and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Philip Crane, chairman of the subcommittee that handles  
trade matters in the House, called on Clinton to back up his call 
for new global trade talks with an aggressive effort to get fast 
track approved by Congress in the next six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be extraordinarily difficult for the president to be  
credible in these negotiations without having fast track 
authority,'' said Crane, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Hufbauer, an economist at the Institute of International  
Economics, said that the decision to push ahead with a new trade 
round was not likely to overcome opposition to fast track among 
Democrats, especially in the House. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clinton will really have to work to persuade those in his own  
party in the face of determined opposition among labor unions,'' 
Hufbauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Greg Mastel, a trade expert at the Economic Strategy  
Institute, said a new trade round, with its promise of major trade 
liberalization in a number of areas, ``improves the chances for 
fast track but it is still an uphill battle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	European and Japanese officials had been urging the United  
States to back a new, comprehensive round of negotiations but the 
administration had been debating internally just how broad those 
talks should be, fearing a repeat of the impasse that plagued the 
last global trade talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Those discussions, known as the Uruguay Round, because they were  
launched in 1986 in Punta del Este, Uruguay, dragged on for seven 
years because countries could not reach agreement on all facets of 
the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	While planning to push for comprehensive talks, the  
administration wants a more limited range of negotiations than the 
Uruguay Round. Among the areas it will seek to cover are industrial 
tariffs, agriculture, services, intellectual property, labor rights 
and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Europeans and Japan have said they would like a three-year  
deadline on the talks, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The actual scope of the talks will be decided in discussions  
over the next several months leading up to the December ministerial 
meeting. While the site has not been selected, the six cities being 
considered are Dallas, Denver, Detroit, San Diego, Seattle and 
Honolulu.

<HEADLINE> McEnroe Named to Tennis Hall of Fame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- John McEnroe, the tempestuous winner of four  
U.S. Open titles and three Wimbledon crowns, was elected to the 
International Tennis Hall of Fame today. 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe produced great tennis, starting with well-placed serves  
and usually ending with sharp, winning volleys. 
</P>
<P>
	But his accomplishments shared equal billing with his tantrums.  
McEnroe could be merciless toward linesmen and referees, berating 
them with profane outbursts that often riled the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Also voted into the hall was Ken McGregor of Australia. He was  
elected as a master player. The two will be inducted into the Hall 
of Fame at Newport, R.I., July 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The youngest player to reach the No. 1 ranking, McEnroe burst  
onto the tennis scene at the French Open in 1977 when he teamed 
with Mary Carillo to win the mixed doubles title. 
</P>
<P>
	Equally skilled in singles and doubles, McEnroe won 77 titles in  
each. Among his 17 major crowns were Wimbledon singles 
championships in 1981, '83 and '84, and U.S. Open singles titles in 
1979-81 and '84. 
</P>
<P>
	He paired with Peter Fleming for doubles champinships at  
Wimbledon in 1979, '81, '83 and '84, and at the U.S. Open in '79, 
'81 and '83. He teamed with Michael Stich to win Wimbledon in '92 
and with Mark Woodforde to capture the U.S. Open in '89. 
</P>
<P>
	As a member of the U.S. Davis Cup team, McEnroe compiled a 59-10  
overall record in 12 years. He was the ATP Tour's Player of the 
Year in '81, '83 and '84, and he and Fleming won Doubles Team of 
the Year honors in '79 and '81. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1980, at 21 years, 15 days, McEnroe became the youngest  
player to achieve the No. 1 ranking. During his career, he was the 
top-ranked men's player for a total of 170 weeks, and finished as 
the No. 1 player four straight years (1981-84). 
</P>
<P>
	McGregor was an integral member of the 1950 Australian Davis Cup  
team that ended the United States' four-year possession of the Cup. 
The Aussies also won the international team trophy in 1951 and '52. 
</P>
<P>
	McGregor teamed with countryman and Hall of Famer Frank Sedgman  
to complete the only male Grand Slam in doubles in 1951, and the 
duo won three of the four majors the following year. McGregor also 
won the U.S. mixed doubles championship with Hall of Famer Margaret 
Osborne duPont in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
	In singles, McGregor was ranked in the top 10 from 1950-52 and  
won the Australian title in 1952, defeating Sedgman in the final.

<HEADLINE> Internet Firm AtHome To Buy Excite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- High-speed Internet provider AtHome Corp. is  
buying Excite Inc., one of the leading destinations on the World 
Wide Web, for about $6.7 billion in stock in one of the largest 
Internet company deals ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced today would surpass America Online Inc.'s  
$4.2 billion acquisition of Netscape Communications Corp. last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on closing stock prices Friday, Excite is worth about $3.4  
billion, meaning that AtHome would be paying a premium of nearly 
100 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal could eventually give telecommunications giant AT&AMP;T  
Corp. control of one of the highly sought-after portals that serve 
as entry points onto the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	AtHome is owned by Tele-Communications Inc., Cox Communications  
and several other investors. TCI is in the process of merging with 
AT&AMP;T Corp. in a $39 billion deal that is expected to be completed 
by spring. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T Corp. chief executive Michael Armstrong has stated he wants  
to use AtHome as a conduit for delivering a wide range of 
communications services, including electronic commerce. Control 
over Excite, which has a search engine and links to several online 
shopping sites, would certainly enhance that goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Excite, which has lagged behind other Web-site companies, such  
as Yahoo!, has been looking for a larger partner in the rapidly 
consolidating Internet portal market, especially in wake of the 
AOL-Netscape deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Several other companies had been rumored to be interested in  
Excite, including Yahoo! Inc. and Microsoft Corp. Negotiations 
between Yahoo! and Excite broke off this weekend, according to 
published reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Excite, eager to extend its reach and market power, was  
attracted by an alliance with AT&AMP;T and TCI. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Internet Firm At Home To Buy Excite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- High-speed Internet provider At Home Corp. is  
buying Excite Inc., one of the leading destinations on the World 
Wide Web, for about $6.7 billion in stock in one of the largest 
Internet company deals ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced today would surpass America Online Inc.'s  
acquisition of Netscape Communications Corp. last year for $4.2 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on closing stock prices Friday, Excite is worth about $3.4  
billion, which would mean that At Home would be paying a huge 
premium. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal could eventually give telecommunications giant AT&AMP;T  
Corp. control of one of the highly sought-after portals that serve 
as entry points onto the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	At Home is owned by Tele-Communications Inc., Cox Communications  
and several other investors. TCI is in the process of merging with 
AT&AMP;T Corp. in a $39 billion deal that is expected to be completed 
by spring. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T Corp. chief executive Michael Armstrong has stated he wants  
to use At Home as a conduit for delivering a wide range of 
communications services, including electronic commerce. Control 
over Excite, which has a search engine and links to several online 
shopping sites, would certainly enhance that goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Excite, which has lagged behind other Web-site companies, such  
as Yahoo!, has been looking for a larger partner in the rapidly 
consolidating Internet portal market, especially in wake of the 
AOL-Netscape deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Word that an At Home-Excite deal was in the works was reported  
Monday by the San Jose Mercury News. 
</P>
<P>
	Several other companies had been rumored to be interested in  
Excite, including Yahoo! Inc. and Microsoft Corp. Negotiations 
between Yahoo! and Excite broke off this weekend, according to 
published reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Excite, eager to extend its reach and market power, was  
attracted by an alliance with AT&AMP;T and TCI. 
</P>
<P>
	Excite's shareholders are expected to own about 30 percent of  
the combined company, which would be known as At Home Networks. 
Excite chief executive George Bell would take a position on the new 
company's executive board, reporting to At Home chief executive Tom 
Jermoluk. 
</P>
<P>
	At Home, which delivers high-speed Internet service over cable  
TV lines, has more than 330,000 customers. The deal would give it 
access to Excite's more than 20 million registered users and to the 
company's content-development capabilities.

<HEADLINE> Safety of Montreal Stadium in Doubt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- The permanent $24 million Kevlar roof covering  
Olympic Stadium failed to withstand its first heavy snowfall, 
leaving a gaping, dripping sheet of torn blue plastic hanging over 
the baseball park. 
</P>
<P>
	The weight proved too much for one of the ill-fated stadium's 63  
fiberglass roof panels, which ripped open Monday afternoon, sending 
the snow onto workers setting up an auto show more than 60 feet 
below. 
</P>
<P>
	Five people were slightly injured, and several car displays were  
wrecked. There were 200 people in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	``These chunks of ice were coming down and if somebody had been  
right under it they would have been dead,'' said Burt Vandergraaf, 
who was working close to where an avalanche of snow came through 
the tear. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like a big explosion,'' said Vandergraaf, who was  
setting up a display for Jaguar. ``You looked up and it looked like 
it was a big zipper opening. '' 
</P>
<P>
	Many witnesses reported hearing a sharp bang when the roof let  
go. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as we heard the roof coming down, we started  
running,'' said Elaine Griffin, of Subaru Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	``Four of us got hit with globs of snow. I was swept off my  
feet. I was knocked down on my face and stomach. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of snow came down, icy, slushy snow. I'm still shaking a  
little bit. You can't believe how close you came.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The roof is in two layers: an outer layer of Teflon-coated  
fiberglass supported by a network of interconnecting beams, much 
like a Tinker Toy model, and a new blue liner of irregularly shaped 
sections stitched together. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic Installations Board officials say they had warned people  
to stay away from an area near the home-plate end of the stadium 
after the roof started dripping, but many of the workers said the 
warnings were inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
	Stadium officials and engineers from Birdair, the roof-building  
firm, moved quickly to assess the damage and the likelihood of 
being able to repair the roof in time for the car show's opening on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident is the latest chapter in the history of the  
stadium, built for the 1976 Summer Olympics and home to the Expos. 
</P>
<P>
	With continual roof problems and walls that have crumbled a  
couple of times, the stadium has been a financial drain and a 
blight on civic pride. Known locally as the Big Owe, it cost well 
over $1 billion and Quebecers are still paying for it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we can say we are embarrassed by this,'' admitted  
Andre Huberdeau, vice president of marketing for the agency that 
runs the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract to build the roof was awarded to Birdair in 1997.  
At the time, officials estimated its lifespan at 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	This model was chosen over the previous Kevlar roof -- which cost  
$48.75 million and was never as retractable as designed -- because 
it was supposed to be able to hold the snow better.

<HEADLINE> Delgado, Sele Seeking Raises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Toronto first baseman Carlos Delgado sought $6.5  
million and Texas pitcher Aaron Sele wanted $6.25 million, the top 
asking prices Tuesday when 38 players and teams exchanged salary 
arbitration figures. 
</P>
<P>
	New York Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter and Baltimore catcher  
Charles Johnson both wanted at least $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 62 players filed for arbitration last week. There  
were 14 settlements Tuesday, led by Yankees pitcher Andy Pettitte's 
one-year deal for $5.95 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The 38 players who swapped figures -- down from 60 last year --  
are believed to be the fewest since 1979. Players who do not settle 
will be scheduled for arbitration hearings during the first three 
weeks of February, but no more than 10 cases are expected to go 
that far. 
</P>
<P>
	Delgado made $2.4 million last year when he hit .292 with 38  
homers and 115 RBIs. The Blue Jays offered $4.2 million this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Sele earned $2.85 million last year when he went 19-11 with a  
4.23 ERA. The Rangers offered $4.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter and Yankees closer Mariano Rivera, who each made $750,000  
last season, are both guaranteed big raises. Jeter asked for $5 
million and was offered $3.2 million, and Rivera sought $4.25 
million and was offered $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, traded from Los Angeles to Baltimore in the offseason,  
asked for $5.1 million and the Orioles offered $3.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures for other top players: Houston closer Billy Wagner  
($3.3 million-$2 million); San Diego pitcher Sterling Hitchcock 
($4.75 million-$3.85 million); New York Mets second baseman Edgardo 
Alfonzo ($3.85 million-$2.5 million); St. Louis pitcher Darren 
Oliver ($4.15 million-$3.55 million) and Chicago White Sox second 
baseman Ray Durham ($4.3 million-$3.35 million). 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland reliever Ron Villone had the smallest range, asking  
for $500,000 and being offered $425,000.

<HEADLINE> AOL Removes Online Thesaurus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DULLES, Va. (AP) -- America Online and the Merriam-Webster Inc.  
Web site have temporarily removed a thesaurus that included two 
slurs among synonyms for the word ``homosexual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The thesaurus is being reworked to remove all synonyms for  
``homosexual,'' including ``fruit'' and ``faggot,'' and to clarify 
symbols that indicate potentially offensive words. 
</P>
<P>
	Merriam-Webster and Dulles-based AOL, which licenses the  
thesaurus from Merriam-Webster, took the thesaurus offline Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Deborah Burns, Merriam-Webster's director of marketing, said the  
company decided Monday to remove all synonyms for ``homosexual'' to 
conform with a 25-year-old policy not to offer entries for racial 
or ethnic groups such as Jews, Hispanics or blacks, Ms. Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Along the way, we should have incorporated sexual groups into  
that same policy,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Merriam-Webster, a leading publisher of dictionaries and  
language reference books, is checking its Collegiate Thesaurus for 
other disparaging entries. 
</P>
<P>
	``But first, we're making an apology about this. We were in  
error in a couple of ways and we're glad someone has brought it to 
our attention,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gay rights groups learned of the words after a radio talk show  
host typed the word ``homosexual'' into AOL's thesaurus database on 
Thursday, saw the synonyms and e-mailed them to a friend at GAYBC 
Radio Network, an Internet-based audio news service. 
</P>
<P>
	The quick action by AOL, the world's largest online service, and  
Merriam-Webster pleased the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against 
Defamation. 
</P>
<P>
	GLAAD spokeswoman Cathy Renna said the group was not calling for  
the synonyms to be deleted, but that they be presented as 
derogatory and highly offensive. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not that they are words that people don't know and don't  
use, but in 1999, they are words that should be presented in some 
sort of context,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Burns said the online thesaurus included symbols that  
indicate such words have ``limited use,'' usually meaning they are 
derogatory, and that people should check the words in a dictionary 
before using them. But to find the key explaining the symbols, 
online users had to click through five additional pages. 
</P>
<P>
	When the thesaurus goes back online, she said, the key will  
appear on the same page with the synonyms. Similar changes will be 
made in the next printed version of the thesaurus.

<HEADLINE> Court Mulls Workers' Compensation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Those insurers who pay workers state-required  
compensation for injuries suffered at work are no more an arm of 
the government than other private insurance companies are, a lawyer 
for the providers told the Supreme Court on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The determination is key to whether insurers could be sued for  
violating employees' due-process rights under the Constitution. A 
judge had dismissed claims filed by employees who found their 
benefits cut off in Pennsylvania pending a review. 
</P>
<P>
	Several other states also authorize the withholding of disputed  
payments while a review is pending, and a ruling in the employees' 
favor could raise questions about the integrity of those state 
laws. Insurers argued that such dispute-resolution mechanisms are 
legal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Private companies regularly withhold payments during  
disputes,'' said Michael W. McConnell, an attorney for several of 
the workers comp insurers. ``If you're involved with a fender 
bender and you have a dispute, the insurance company will decline 
to pay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Loralyn McKinley, representing 10 employees, considered workers  
compensation a state benefit because state law mandated coverage 
and created a complex regulatory scheme governing payments and 
dispute resolution. 
</P>
<P>
	``The individual is trapped in the system and is not permitted  
to go outside the system,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Stephen G. Breyer questioned that premise, noting that  
dozens of other insurance types are heavily regulated as well, some 
of which carry state-assisted backup funds to cover liability the 
insurers cannot cover themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you claim that all insurance that is regulated is a state  
action?'' he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Pennsylvania's 1993 workers compensation law only requires  
employers to pay for ``reasonable'' and ``necessary'' medical care 
for employees who suffer work-related injuries or disease and to 
pay money as partial replacement of lost wages. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to the spiraling costs of medical treatment, the  
state Legislature gave insurers authority to withhold payments for 
disputed medical bills until a review, which usually takes a few 
months, is completed. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is American Manufacturers Mutual Insurance Co. vs.  
Sullivan, 97-2000.

	HOUSTON (AP) -- The Houston Astros avoided arbitration with a  
pair of pitchers, agreeing Tuesday to a $3.65 million, three-year 
contract with Jay Powell and a one-year deal with Sean Bergman 
worth $1,875,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Bergman, 28, was 12-9 with a 3.72 ERA last season in 27 starts  
and four relief appearances, setting career highs for wins, innings 
(172) and strikeouts (100). He walked 42, overcoming control 
problems he had in five prior seasons at Detroit and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Powell, 26, was acquired from Florida in July. He was 3-3 with a  
2.38 ERA and four saves for Houston and 7-7 with a 3.33 ERA 
overall. 
</P>
<P>
	Powell made $320,000 last season, and Bergman made $465,000.  
</P>
<P>
	Houston previously averted arbitration by signing catcher Tony  
Eusebio and right-hander Jose Lima. 
</P>
<P>
	The three Astros remain in arbitration: outfielder Carl Everett,  
infielder Ricky Gutierrez and closer Billy Wagner.

<HEADLINE> Finnish IOC Member Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- A Finnish member of the IOC  
resigned today, the first member of the international committee to 
step down in the widening bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Olympic Committee said today that Pirjo  
Haggman had presented her resignation to IOC president Juan Antonio 
Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC president thanks Mrs. Haggman for all the services  
which she gave to the Olympic movement as an athlete and as a 
member of the organization,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Haggman, 47, was an IOC member since 1981, and was one of the  
first two women on the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	A middle-distance runner in the 1972, '76 and '80 Olympics, she  
was 12-time Finnish champion at 100 and 400 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	Haggman's ex-husband, Bjarne, reportedly worked briefly for the  
Salt Lake bid committee and for 20 months in an Ontario government 
job initiated by the Toronto committee bidding for the 1996 Summer 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Haggman is only the second IOC member to resign in a scandal.  
Robert Helmick stepped down in 1991 as an IOC member and president 
of the U.S. Olympic Committee amid allegations of conflict of 
interest in contracts with sports associations. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, IOC officials said their investigation into the  
allegations of corruption will extend beyond Salt Lake's efforts to 
secure the Winter Olympics to bids made by other cities in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC director general Francois Carrard said a six-member IOC  
investigating commission is determined ``to look at every piece of 
evidence'' concerning graft, bribery and vote-buying allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	He was quoted by The Washington Post as saying the inquiry no  
longer is confined to Salt Lake City's bid but that investigators 
are gathering facts worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	People involved in other cities' Olympic bids recently have come  
forward with assertions that some IOC members suggested that how 
they would vote might hinge on how well they were treated. 
</P>
<P>
	``For many years, there were rumors. We have never been able to  
have the beginning of evidence,'' Carrard said. ``We had 
allegations; we had hearsay. When we tried to get evidence, we 
always faced a wall of silence, even by people who said publicly 
they would disclose certain things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, due to the Salt Lake City scandal, Carrard said, the IOC is  
for the first time uncovering hard facts, including ``names, 
amounts, account numbers and access to files and documents from 
where we could go on with the investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC's panel, led by vice president Dick Pound of Canada, has  
asked 13 IOC members to explain actions by themselves or members of 
their families. Samaranch says nine cases are serious enough to 
possibly lead to expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC executive board will recommend action Jan. 24, with the  
full 115-member IOC called into special session March 17-18 to 
decide their fate and consider changes in the bidding process. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound, interviewed on ABC's ``Nightline'' Monday night, said  
that before the March meeting, ``we will write to the leaders of 
all the bid committees in recent games ... and ask them to come 
forward now that they can see we're serious'' about getting rid of 
the bad apples. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe they'll come forward. Maybe we'll find some additional  
names. Maybe we'll find the same people,'' he said. ``It's not 
something we're shirking. It's going to be painful and it's 
embarrassing but we're going to come out of it, I think, a stronger 
and better Olympics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Utah, Olympic critics demanded a statewide vote on whether  
taxpayers are willing to accept potential financial liability. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar initiative effort four years ago was unsuccessful, but  
that was before the scandal over Salt Lake Olympics officials' 
distributing hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, scholarships 
and gifts to IOC members and their relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Utahns for Responsible Public Spending is not sure even a  
stronger, better Olympics should be in Utah, particularly if its 
taxpayers may have to foot part of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've gotta figure out who's going to pay and quit pointing  
fingers at each other,'' said Stephen Pace, head of the group 
critical of Utah holding the games. ``The governor says the state 
has a moral obligation. Do voters believe they do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The group filed a proposed initiative petition with the  
lieutenant governor's office. If the Legislature doesn't force the 
IOC to share in the financial risks or call a public vote on state 
guarantees of public debt, the group will begin circulating the 
petition to put the issue on the 2000 general election ballot. It 
would need around 125,000 signatures. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years ago, the group failed to get enough signatures on an  
almost identical initiative petition. Pace hopes the scandal will 
give the effort new steam. ``The shock is just beginning to set in 
for the people,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The petition is phrased to say that Utah would not guarantee or  
reimburse the debt or obligations of any organization hosting the 
Olympic Winter Games. If voters approved it, Salt Lake City alone 
would be on the hook. 
</P>
<P>
	The city, by contract with the IOC, is obligated to pay any  
debts left behind by the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah's governor in 1991 signed a contract saying the state would  
stand behind Salt Lake in meeting any shortfall, and current Gov. 
Mike Leavitt says the state has a moral obligation. Yet he 
acknowledges Utah's Constitution prohibits the state from 
guaranteeing a city's debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Pace believes Utah residents would vote to stop the Olympics,  
although that's not something his group can legally propose via an 
initiative drive. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the chance of dumping the games were put to the people this  
spring, I think they'd do it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC chairman Robert Garff has said he remains confident  
organizers can raise all the money they need to meet the $1.4 
billion budget 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Payne, IOC marketing director, also expressed confidence  
Monday. He said no sponsor had pulled out, and the amount raised 
through sponsorship to date is $900 million -- which is more than at 
this state for any other Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as Salt Lake City is concerned, let me say  
unequivocally that the sponsor issues are not putting the games in 
jeopardy,'' he said. ``The 2002 Salt Lake City Games will go on and 
will be extremely successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his state-of-the-state address Monday night, Leavitt noted  
Utah's ``relentless soul-searching'' over the scandal and its 
willingness to expose the mistakes and form new Olympic leadership. 
The IOC should do the same, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They must tell all, they must expel the offenders, they must  
change the bid process and return the Olympics to its place as a 
force of human ennoblement,'' Leavitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let history remember this as the cleansing moment when we all  
looked inward and returned the games to its roots of athleticism 
and altruism rather than money and materialism.''

<HEADLINE> Rural Doctor Program Said to Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A medical school program designed to  
encourage physicians to practice in rural areas has succeeded in 
easing shortages of small-town doctors, researchers reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors are increasingly attracted to the big pay and prestige  
of practicing in cities and suburbs. In 1974, Thomas Jefferson 
University in Philadelphia started trying to do something about it. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 1978 and 1991, 34 percent of the 206 graduates of  
Jefferson's Physicians Shortage Area Program headed to country 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Many have stayed: The study found that 87 percent of the  
graduates who were practicing in small towns five to 10 years ago 
are still there. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, 12 percent of all rural family doctors in Pennsylvania  
come from the Jefferson program, said Howard Rabinowitz, the 
program's director and author of the study published in today's 
Journal of the American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1985 graduate, Dr. James Devlin, makes house calls just as his  
father did in Brockway, a town of about 2,200 people 90 miles 
northeast of Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew that I wanted to return to this small-town atmosphere  
and practice medicine in much the same way,'' Devlin said. ``I am 
able to care for patients who are also my friends, practicing 
family medicine in its purest form, in a time when the emphasis in 
medicine is on primary care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study's authors noted that if Jefferson -- one of the only  
private, urban medical schools with such a program -- can succeed at 
placing rural doctors, schools closer to the countryside might do 
even better. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shows other private institutions could do that and have a  
real impact. Unfortunately, most private institutions don't 
consider this something they should tackle,'' said Dr. Roger 
Rosenblatt, vice chairman of family medicine at the University of 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Students in the Jefferson program follow a typical curriculum  
but also take courses on practicing in a rural community, are 
trained in small towns and are paired with an academic adviser from 
the family medicine department. 
</P>
<P>
	When it is time for their residencies, most of the young doctors  
in the Jefferson program get their experience in small towns 
instead of big cities.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sees Castro Role in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department expressed hope Tuesday  
that Cuban President Fidel Castro will use his influence to promote 
peace and democracy in Colombia -- if he assumes a role as mediator 
in that country's civil war. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman James P. Rubin noted that Castro accepted a request  
from Colombian President Andres Pastrana to act as a go-between at 
some point in Colombia's peace process. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this were to occur, let me simply say we hope that Castro  
would convey very clearly to the insurgents that the time for 
violence is over and that all Colombians should be working towards 
a negotiated settlement with full respect for democratic 
institutions and human rights,'' Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``If the communist leader of Cuba thinks he can  
persuade communist insurgents to lay down their arms, we're not 
going to complain about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pastrana met with Castro in Havana in recent days. Also taking  
part in the talks was Venezuelan President-elect Hugo Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
	Pastrana has given high priority to ending Colombia's 34-year  
civil war and opened negotiations on Jan. 7 with Colombia's largest 
guerrilla group, the 15,000-member Revolutionary Armed Forces of 
Colombia.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Address-3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *UNDATED: be 3,000.    	
</P>
<P>
	Fifth, to assure that our classrooms are truly places of  
learning, and to respond to what teachers have been asking us to do 
for years, we should say that all states and school districts must 
adopt and implement sensible discipline policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, let's do one more thing for our children. Today, too many  
of our schools are so old they're falling apart, or so overcrowded 
students are learning in trailers. Last fall, Congress missed the 
opportunity to change that. This year, with 53 million children in 
our schools, Congress must not miss that opportunity again. I ask 
you to help our communities build or modernize 5,000 schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Now if, if we do these things -- end social promotion, turn  
around failing schools, build modern ones, support qualified 
teachers, promote innovation, competition and discipline -- then we 
will begin to meet our generation's historic responsibility to 
create 21st century schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Now we also have to do more to help the millions of parents who  
give their all every day at home and at work. 
</P>
<P>
	The most basic tool of all is a decent income. So Let's raise  
the minimum wage by a dollar an hour over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
	And let's make sure that women and men get equal pay for equal  
work by strengthening enforcement of the equal pay laws. That was 
encouraging, you know. There was more balance on the seesaw. I like 
that. Let's give 'em a hand! Give 'em -- that was great. 
</P>
<P>
	Working parents also need quality child care. So again this  
year, I ask Congress to support our plan for tax credits and 
subsidies for working families, for improved safety and quality, 
for expanded after-school programs. Our plan also includes a new 
tax credit for stay-at-home parents too. They need support as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents should never have to worry about choosing between their  
children and their work. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the Family Medical Leave Act -- the first bill I signed into  
law -- has now since 1993 helped millions and millions of Americans 
to care for a new baby or an ailing relative without risking their 
jobs. I think with all the evidence that it has been so little 
burdensome to employers that we should extend family leave to 10 
million more Americans working in smaller companies. And I hope you 
will support it. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, on the matter of work, parents should never face  
discrimination in the workplace. So I want to ask Congress to 
prohibit companies from refusing to hire or promote workers simply 
because they have children. That is not right. 
</P>
<P>
	America's families deserve the world's best medical care.  
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to bipartisan federal support for medical research, we  
are now on the verge of new treatments to prevent or delay diseases 
from Parkinson's to Alzheimer's, to arthritis to cancer, but as we 
continue our advances in medical science, we can't let our health 
care system lag behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Managed care has transformed medicine in America -- driving down  
costs, but threatening to drive down quality as well. I think we 
ought to say to every American: You should have the right to know 
all your medical options -- not just the cheapest. If you need a 
specialist, you should have a right to see one. You should have the 
right to emergency care if you're in an accident. These are things 
that we ought to say, and I think we ought to say you should have a 
right to keep your doctor during a period of treatment, whether 
it's a pregnancy or chemotherapy or anything else. I believe this. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, I have ordered these rights to be extended to the 85  
million Americans served by Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal 
health programs. 
</P>
<P>
	But only Congress can enact the Patients' Bill of Rights for all  
Americans. Now, last year, last year, thank you. Last year, 
Congress missed that opportunity and we must not miss that 
opportunity again. For the sake of our families, I ask us to joint 
together across party lines and pass a strong, enforceable 
Patients' Bill of Rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Thank you.  
</P>
<P>
	As more of our medical records are stored electronically, the  
threats to all our privacy increase. Because Congress has given me 
the authority to act if it does not do so by August, one way or 
another, we can all say to the American people we will protect the 
privacy of medical records and w we will do it this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, two years ago, the Congress extended health coverage to up  
to 5 million children. Now, we should go beyond that. We should 
make it easier for small businesses to offer health insurance. We 
should give people between the ages of 55 and 65 who lose their 
health insurance the chance to buy into Medicare, and we should 
continue to ensure access to family planning. No one should have to 
choose between keeping health care and taking a job. And therefore, 
I especially ask you tonight to join hands to pass the landmark 
bipartisan legislation proposed by Senators Kennedy and Jeffords, 
Roth and Moynihan, to allow people with disabilities to keep their 
health insurance when they go to work. 
</P>
<P>
	We need to enable our public hospitals, our community, our  
university health centers to provide basic, affordable care for all 
the millions of working families who don't have any insurance. They 
do a lot of that today, but much more can be done. And my balanced 
budget makes a good down payment toward that goal. I hope you will 
think about them and support that provision. 
</P>
<P>
	Let me say we must step up our efforts to treat and prevent  
mental illness. No American should ever be able -- afraid, ever, to 
address this disease. This year we will host a White House 
Conference on Mental Health. With sensitivity, commitment, and 
passion, Tipper Gore is leading our efforts here, and I thank her 
for what she's done on it. Thank you. Thank you. 
</P>
<P>
	As everyone knows, our children are targets of a massive media  
campaign to hook them on cigarettes. Now I ask this Congress to 
resist the tobacco lobby, to reaffirm the FDA's authority to 
protect children from tobacco, and to hold the tobacco companies 
accountable while protecting tobacco farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoking has cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars under  
Medicare and other programs. You know, the states have been right 
about this: taxpayers shouldn't pay for the costs of lung cancer, 
emphysema, and other smoking-related illnesses, the tobacco 
companies should. So tonight I announce that the Justice Department 
is preparing a litigation plan to take the tobacco companies to 
court, and with the funds we recover, to strengthen Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, if we act in these areas -- minimum wage, family leave,  
child care, health care, the safety of our children -- then we will 
begin to meet our generation's historic responsibility to 
strengthen our families for the 21st century. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, America is the most dynamic, competitive, job-creating  
economy in history. But we can do even better in building a 21st 
Century economy that embraces all Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's incomes gap is largely a skills gap. Last year, the  
Congress passed a law enabling workers to get a skills grant to 
choose the training they need, and I applaud all of you here who 
were part of that. This year, I recommend a five-year commitment to 
the new system so that we can provide over the next five years 
appropriate training opportunities for all Americans who lose their 
jobs and expand rapid response teams to help all towns which have 
been really hurt when businesses close. I hope you will support 
this. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, I ask for a dramatic increase in federal support for adult  
literacy, to mount a national campaign aimed at helping the 
millions and millions of working people who still read at less than 
a fifth-grade level. We need to do this.

<HEADLINE> Browns' Policy Meets With Shaw </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- With two other candidates to become coach of  
Cleveland's expansion team dropping out of contention, Willie 
Shaw's odds appear to be getting better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look at it as a shot,'' Shaw said. ``It's not a long shot.  
It's my shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw, defensive coordinator for the Oakland Raiders, on Tuesday  
became the latest candidate to have an interview with Browns 
president Carmen Policy concerning the head coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw's meeting with Policy came one day after Brian Billick was  
surprisingly dropped as a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt the fit wasn't right, the chemistry wasn't right,''  
Policy said. Billick was hired Tuesday as head coach of the 
Baltimore Ravens. 
</P>
<P>
	Billick, former offensive coordinator for the Minnesota Vikings,  
was considered the front-runner for the Browns' position after a 
strong interview with Policy last month. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Vikings lost in the NFC championship game Sunday  
against Atlanta, Cleveland football operations director Dwight 
Clark flew to Minnesota to meet Billick. Policy said Clark wasn't 
sent to offer Billick a contract, but planned to continue the 
interview process. 
</P>
<P>
	Policy said Billick indicated to Clark that he still was  
interested in pursuing other opportunities. That was all Policy 
needed to hear. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is our feeling that the first coach of this Cleveland  
Browns organization should be an individual who feels very 
passionately about coming to Cleveland,'' Policy said. ``He should 
feel that this is a unique opportunity, it's not just a job.' 
</P>
<P>
	``He should feel that this is the best opportunity -- not in  
terms of money, but in terms of that opportunity to go forward and 
build and create. If a candidate doesn't have that feeling, I don't 
think they're going to fit here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Policy said he doesn't begrudge Billick's decision and dismissed  
the notion that Ravens owner Art Modell, who took his team from 
Cleveland to Baltimore in 1995, had won the first battle between 
the franchises. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it adds to the fun that already exists in the  
division,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	With the expansion draft three weeks away, Policy is running out  
of time and coaching candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Billick and Denver offensive coordinator Gary Kubiak, who said  
Monday that he was staying with the Broncos, are both off the 
board. That leaves Shaw, Atlanta offensive line coach Art Shell and 
Jacksonville offensive coordinator Chris Palmer as the only coaches 
who have formally met with Policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Policy said the Browns won't announce any more coaching  
interviews, but added that the search could extend into the college 
ranks. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw, 55, was the first defensive coach to meet with Policy, who  
said in the past he preferred an offensive-minded coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Policy changed his mind after seeing Shaw on a videotape the NFL  
distributed in hopes of helping minority coaching candidates get 
interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw, who has spent 12 years as an NFL assistant, joined the  
Raiders before the 1998 season and transformed Oakland's defense 
from one of the league's worst to one of its best. 
</P>
<P>
	Policy said he isn't concerned about Shaw's knowledge being  
limited to one side of the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``Willie Shaw transcends defense,'' he said. ``He transcends  
offense. He seems to have the ability to get players to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As long as he wants those players to be Cleveland Browns, he  
will stay on Policy's list.

<HEADLINE> Court Rejects Long-Distance Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today refused to make it  
easier for the nation's biggest local phone companies to break into 
the $90 billion long-distance market. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, without comment, rejected appeals in which three of  
the five regional Bell telephone companies challenged the special 
hurdles Congress placed in the way of their offering long-distance 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC Communications, US West and Bell Atlantic said the special  
requirements they must meet, spelled out in the Telecommunications 
Act of 1996, are discriminatory and single them out for punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Constitution bars laws that apply to an individual or a  
specific group and is punitive, and the phone companies' appeals 
said Congress subjected them to such a ``bill of attainder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The appeal filed jointly on behalf of SBC and US West contended  
that Congress never before has ``singled out named companies to 
forbid them, and them alone, from engaging in otherwise lawful 
lines of business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal appeals courts in New Orleans and the District of  
Columbia rejected that argument and upheld the disputed 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyers urged the highest court to leave  
those rulings intact, arguing that ``nothing in the challenged 
provisions can plausibly be characterized as punishment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 law requires Baby Bells to open their local phone  
markets to long-distance companies and other potential rivals 
before the Federal Communications Commission will let them sell 
their own long-distance service to local customers. 
</P>
<P>
	No Bell company has yet won such FCC approval because, the  
commission says, none has sufficiently opened its market. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, the five Baby Bells provide more than 80 percent of  
the local phone service in the United States. The other two 
regional companies are BellSouth and Ameritech. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court currently has under study, and is expected to  
decide by July, the validity of federal rules aimed at quickly 
opening the $110 billion local telephone market to competition. At 
issue in that separate dispute is whether the FCC or the states 
have the authority to set pricing rules for the new competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for SBC and US West urged the justices ``to provide the  
lower courts -- and Congress -- with needed guidance as to the rules 
governing the legislature's ability to impose burdens on a targeted 
few.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They said the challenged provisions are depriving consumers of  
as much as $300 billion in savings that would flow from a more 
competitive long-distance market. 
</P>
<P>
	Government lawyers disagreed, telling the court that the Baby  
Bells' challenge threatens ``to unravel much of the 1996 act, to 
the great detriment of American consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court five times has struck down acts of Congress as  
unconstitutional bills of attainder, most notably laws that exposed 
members or adherents of the Confederacy and Communist Party to 
punitive treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike sanctions based on someone's political affiliation,  
``business regulations based on corporate economic power and 
incentives ... rest not on a desire to 'punish' the regulated 
corporations but on a recognition of the objective dangers posed by 
monopoly power,'' government lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the phone companies' appeals were supported in  
friend-of-the-court briefs submitted by 12 states -- Arizona, 
Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Michigan, Mississippi, New Mexico, 
Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The cases are SBC Communications vs. FCC, 98-652, and Bell  
Atlantic vs. FCC, 98-653.

	White House To Open Clinton Defense  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's defense lawyers today  
added congressional Democrats to their team to bolster arguments 
that his impeachment was handled in a partisan manner. A White 
House spokesman declined to name the House Democrats or say how 
many are involved. He said the lawmakers would make presentations 
during the opening arguments to explain how the impeachment effort 
``moved forward in a very partisan way, and in a way that was not 
fair to the president.'' The White House team is expected to focus 
on conflicts in testimony gathered by Independent Counsel Kenneth 
Starr, a shift in strategy aimed at undercutting House charges of 
perjury and obstruction of justice. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton: Boost Social Security Fund  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton in his State of the Union  
address tonight is expected to propose that most of the projected 
government budget surplus be used to bolster Social Security and 
create new 401(k)-style retirement accounts for most American 
workers. The president also will propose using some of the surplus 
to support the ailing Medicare system. However, Republicans have 
said they want the budget surplus spent in part to reduce taxes.

	Willey Case Witness Pleads Innocent

<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- A friend whose testimony cast doubt on  
Kathleen Willey's allegation of an unwanted sexual advance by 
President Clinton pleaded innocent today and her lawyer vowed to 
seek dismissal of the case brought by prosecutor Kenneth Starr. 
Julie Hiatt Steele is accused of three counts of obstruction of 
justice and one of making a false statement in connection with her 
filing of an allegedly false affidavit in Paula Jones' sexual 
harassment lawsuit against Clinton. Mrs. Willey, a former White 
House volunteer, claims Clinton made an unwanted sexual advance in 
1993.

<P>
	PETROVO, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Two top NATO generals arrived in  
Yugoslavia today and warned President Slobodan Milosevic to end 
assaults on ethnic Albanians or face possible military strikes. 
However, Serb forces ignored the demands and continued to bombard 
the hills surrounding a Kosovo village where 45 ethnic Albanians 
were massacred. Yugoslavian officials yesterday ordered the 
American head of a peace verifying mission to leave the country and 
barred the chief of a U.N. war crimes tribunal from investigating 
the massacre site.

	Court Won't Bar Electric Chair  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today refused to bar  
Florida's use of the electric chair as the sole means of imposing 
the death penalty. The justices rejected an appeal in which death 
row inmate Eduardo Lopez, a convicted murderer, challenged death in 
the electric chair as unlawfully cruel and unusual punishment. Of 
the 38 states with capital punishment, only four require execution 
by electrocution. Florida officials imposed a one-year moratorium 
on executions after a fire started during Pedro Medina's March 25, 
1997, electrocution.

	21 Die, 300 Hurt in S. Africa Storm

<P>
	MOUNT AYLIFF, South Africa (AP) -- At least 21 people were killed  
and more than 300 injured when a storm tore through this small 
village yesterday. Rescue workers and police using sniffer dogs 
today searched for survivors and victims. At least 50 houses were 
flattened in the storm, which weather officials could not confirm 
as a tornado. But it carried winds strong enough to wrest trees 
from the earth, blow over a bus and pluck a truck from a road and 
hurl it into a field.

<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- A Finnish member of the IOC  
resigned today, the first member of the international committee to 
step down in the widening bribery scandal. Pirjo Haggman was an IOC 
member since 1981, and was one of the first two women on the 
committee. Haggman's ex-husband, Bjarne, reportedly worked briefly 
for the Salt Lake bid committee. Haggman is only the second IOC 
member to resign in a scandal. Robert Helmick stepped down in 1991 
as an IOC member and president of the U.S. Olympic Committee amid 
allegations of conflict of interest in contracts with sports 
associations.

<HEADLINE> Witness: IOC Members Got Hookers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- At least two IOC members accepted offers of  
prostitutes from the Amsterdam committee that bid for the 1992 
Summer Games, a member of an Olympic promotional group said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was there and saw it, IOC members being offered women and  
two accepting,'' said Prince Frederic von Saxe-Lauenberg, a member 
of the Pierre de Coubertin International Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the two were African members, but declined to name them.  
He said six other IOC members making a site-inspection visit to 
Amsterdam in 1986 had declined the offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prostitutes were offered to several IOC members and they took  
it for granted they would be offered,'' he said in a telephone 
interview. ``They ask if there was anything else you could offer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prostitution is licensed in parts of Amsterdam.  
</P>
<P>
	Von Saxe-Lauenberg said IOC members also were given video  
cassette recorders and their wives were offered diamond broaches by 
the Amsterdam committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Roel Walraven, a member of Amsterdam's bid committee, admitted  
that IOC members had been VCRs. But he stopped there. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know nothing about visits to brothels or diamonds in hotel  
rooms,'' he said. ``But it was standard practice to pamper IOC 
members.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barcelona won the 1992 Summer Games over a crowded field.  
Amsterdam was eliminated in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC, embarrassed by the excess of gifts, travel and other  
inducements from the 1992 bidders, imposed its first rules on what 
prospective host cities could offer members after the election in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Allegations of sexual favors offered to IOC members have long  
been rumored, but British-born Von Saxe-Lauenberg said there was 
now ``fertile ground'' in the wake of an investigation into charges 
that members received cash payments and lavish gifts from boosters 
of the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	An ethics panel in Salt Lake City is also looking into  
allegations that IOC members were provided with females escorts. 
</P>
<P>
	Von Saxe-Lauenberg said he'd traveled, often at his own expense,  
to cities bidding for the Olympics and had seen ``similar kinds of 
things over and over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been going on for quite a while, since 1958 when Tokyo  
offered Geisha girls to win the games in 1964. It's quite old,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he'd tried to speak out before but his words ``had  
fallen largely on deaf ears.'' He said he had also been cautious 
because of the committee's ties to the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pierre de Coubertin committee is named for the founder of  
the modern Olympic Games and ``works on the adoption of principles 
and ideas'' related to the ``Olympic spirit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The committee describes itself as a non-governmental  
``apolitical'' body espousing the ideals of de Coubertin. Von 
Saxe-Lauenberg said the committee gets $29,000 a year from the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have come forth because I believe these IOC members are  
doing damage to the Olympic movement,'' he said. ``The actions of 
its members have gotten out of hand and they've become monsters. 
They have overstepped the mark ... and they need to be stopped, 
rooted out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Von Saxe-Lauenberg also called for Juan Antonio Samaranch to  
resign as IOC president. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has let them get out of hand, he should take early  
retirement,'' Von Saxe-Lauenberg said. ``The president of the IOC 
is supposed to keep his members in line.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Lower; Dow Down 31 Points / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks were slightly lower in early  
afternoon on fears that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan 
might attempt to cool the market's recent advances. 
</P>
<P>
	But Nasdaq stocks were higher on the strength of  
Internet-related shares. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down down 31.16 at 9,309.39 , after rising as high as 9,398.99, up 
58.44, in the first hour of trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite, which is heavily weighted in technology  
shares, was up 39.46 at 2,387.66, although it was still below its 
best level of the day, up 46.19 at 2,394.39. And the Standard &AMP; 
Poor's 500 index was up 2.57 at 1,245.83. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues led advancers by 1,544 to 1,437 on the New York  
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 632.84 million shares, up 
slightly from Friday's pace. The market was closed Monday for the 
Martin Luther King holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	Eugene Peroni, technical analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott in  
Philadelphia, said stock prices were falling on fears that when 
Greenspan testifies before Congress on Wednesday, he will say that 
the market has gone too far too fast. 
</P>
<P>
	Any hint that Greenspan is reasserting his ``irrational  
exuberance'' warning of last year will squelch already dim hopes 
that the Fed will ease interest rates soon, Peroni said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of the big moves in Internet stocks and the fact that  
the down has gone on to make a new high recently, the bias seems to 
favor that he will be a bit more cautious,'' Peroni said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow industrial index shot up 5 percent in the first week of  
trading and is currently trading about 2 percent above last year's 
close. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, technology shares got a boost from the announcement  
that At Home Corp. will buy Excite Inc., one of the leading 
destinations on the World Wide Web, for about $6.7 billion in stock 
in one of the largest Internet company deals ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Excite's shares were up 42 1/2 at 110 in leading volume in Nasdaq  
trading, and At Home's shares were up 11 1/2 at 113 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet-related stocks were higher. On the Big Board, AOL was  
up 3 1/2 at 150. In Nasdaq trading, Lycos was up 20 3/4 at 108 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was digesting an unusually large helping of corporate  
earnings reports. 
</P>
<P>
	High-profile financial services companies reporting this morning  
included Chase Manhattan; Bear, Stearns; BankAmerica and Keycorp. 
Chase shares were up 2 7/8 at 73 3/4, but BankAmerica's were down 3/4 at 63 
13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Chase report fourth-quarter net earnings of $1.31 per diluted  
share, compared with 97 cents a year ago. Analysts had expected 
Chase to earn $1.19. BankAmerica reported fourth-quarter net income 
of 91 cents per diluted share. Analysts had expected 93 cents a 
share.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Warned on Social Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dozens of House Democrats are warning  
President Clinton they won't accept any attempt to replace Social 
Security's guaranteed benefits with new private retirement 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a letter to Clinton, the Democrats left room for an  
alternative: Using the budget surplus to subsidize new 401(k)-style 
accounts that people could manage themselves as an addition to -- 
but not a replacement for -- Social Security benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	That's something that has been considered by administration  
officials advising Clinton on what to say in his State of the Union 
address tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said Monday  
that he would reserve the number normally assigned to the year's 
first bill -- H.R. 1 -- for any reforms to the nation's retirement 
system that Clinton proposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wants to use his annual address to Congress to  
jump-start action to overhaul the nation's retirement program, but 
aides wouldn't say Monday just how explicit he would be. 
</P>
<P>
	Many congressional Democrats say they would prefer the president  
to avoid any specific policy endorsements in his speech tonight and 
to pursue bipartisan talks instead. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, a group of 44 House Democrats, plus independent  
Rep. Bernard Sanders of Vermont, took the precaution of telling 
Clinton in a recent letter: ``We are firmly united on one principle 
-- any Social Security privatization plan must be rejected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter was silent, however, on the possibility of  
supplemental accounts using government surpluses, not Social 
Security taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is something I would certainly consider,'' said Sanders,  
who composed the letter to Clinton along with Reps. Jerrold Nadler, 
D-N.Y., and Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Supplemental accounts wouldn't directly address the cash  
shortfall expected to face Social Security as the huge baby boom 
generation retires. But they could help Americans be better 
prepared for retirement and soften the blow of any changes to 
Social Security that might be necessary -- such as raising the 
eligibility age for benefits or limiting retirees' yearly 
cost-of-living raises. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also one option that Clinton could likely broach without  
upsetting lawmakers of either party. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have long advocated diverting some of the Social  
Security taxes now deducted from workers' paychecks into individual 
accounts Americans could invest in the stock market instead. 
Private investments would give most people a better bang for their 
buck than Social Security does, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Democrats strongly oppose moving money out of Social  
Security into such accounts, warning of increasing financial risks 
to individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Retirement benefits should be guaranteed, not subjected to the  
whims of the stock market,'' the House Democrats said in their 
letter. 
</P>
<P>
	However, House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri has  
said he could support supplemental accounts as long taxes earmarked 
for Social Security's guaranteed benefits aren't touched. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders, meanwhile, have already introduced  
legislation to use surpluses to start new retirement accounts -- 
holding open the possibility that some Social Security taxes could 
be transferred into them later. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am hopeful that this idea can be the basis for a bipartisan  
consensus solution to building a secure retirement for all 
Americans,'' Sen. William Roth, R-Del., chairman of the Senate 
Finance Committee, said in a separate letter to colleagues last 
week.

<HEADLINE> UConn Still No. 1 in AP Hoops Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Miami coach Leonard Hamilton understands the historical  
significance of finding the Hurricanes among college basketball's 
top 25 teams. He just hopes his team deserves the same respect come 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you have to earn the right to be in the Top 25,''  
Hamilton said Monday after Miami broke a 39-year absence from The 
Associated Press rankings by capturing the 25th spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not important on January 18th,'' the coach said. ``Now,  
would it be important for the school and the kids to get national 
recognition? Yes, it would. If at the end of the season we're where 
we want to be, I'll be happy. Not on January 18th.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last time Miami was ranked by the AP was the end of the  
1959-60 season, when the Hurricanes were 10th. The span in-between 
included a 15-year gap when the university discontinued the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no change at the top, with Connecticut ranked No. 1  
for the eighth consecutive week and Duke a solid No. 2 for the 
sixth week in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut (15-0), an easy winner over Notre Dame and  
Pittsburgh last week, received 53 first-place votes and 1,755 
points from the national media panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke (17-1), which beat Wake Forest and Florida State last week,  
topped 18 ballots and had 1,721 points. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 3 Stanford and No. 4 Maryland each moved up one spot, taking  
advantage of Cincinnati's first setback in a loss to North 
Carolina-Charlotte. The Bearcats dropped two places to fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn, joining Connecticut as the only unbeaten teams in  
Division I, rose two notches to sixth. The Tigers were followed in 
the Top Ten by Kentucky, St. John's, Arizona and North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State was 11th, followed by New Mexico and UCLA. Next  
came five straight Big Ten teams -- Iowa, Wisconsin, Purdue, 
Minnesota and Indiana. Kansas was 19th and Syracuse 20th. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Christian, Arkansas, Oklahoma State, Louisville and Miami  
rounded out the Top 25. Louisville (10-3) is the week's other 
newcomer, ranked for the first time this season after winning four 
straight. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami (11-3) entered the rankings after winning nine of its past  
10 games, losing only to Notre Dame. Its other losses have been to 
Kentucky and North Carolina-Charlotte; wins have included Ohio 
State and St. John's. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Hamilton, Miami's players accepted the news in a rather  
low-key fashion. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a definite accomplishment,'' said Tim James, the  
Hurricanes' leading scorer with an 18.8 average. ``We've just got 
to keep it strong from here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami's basketball tradition is a brief one. The 1959-60 team  
earned the school's first NCAA tournament berth after a 23-3 
season, losing to Western Kentucky in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Barry, who went on to a Hall of Fame NBA career, played at  
Miami from 1963-65 before jumping to the pros. In 1970, the school 
dropped the sport because of a lack of interest in South Florida, 
not to return until 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a team that's trying to build a tradition,'' said  
Hamilton, 109-132 in his ninth season at Miami. ``Once we get 
there, I hope we'll stay there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State and Clemson fell out of the rankings this week.  
Losses to Iowa and Michigan dropped Ohio State from 21st. Clemson, 
25th last week, lost to Florida State and Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State's exit ends the Big Ten's record-tying run of seven  
teams at one week. The conference also had seven teams ranked in 
January 1993, also lasting one week.

<HEADLINE> Trial Begins in Parental Leave Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A Maryland State Police paramedic who wanted  
parental leave to care for his newborn daughter and ailing wife was 
repeatedly denied only because he is a man, his lawyer said in a 
civil trial that began Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Knussman and the American Civil Liberties Union say in  
their lawsuit that state police violated Knussman's rights and 
broke federal and state laws allowing parents time off to care for 
newborns. 
</P>
<P>
	In court papers, Knussman said one request was rejected by a  
supervisor who said, ``God decided only women can give birth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyer, Robin Cockey, said one administrator told Knussman  
such leave was reserved for mothers and unless his wife was ``dead 
or in a coma'' he could not be given the time off. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Hoffman, a lawyer for the state police, said police could  
only grant Knussman 10 days off, the maximum possible leave for 
``secondary'' caregivers or parents who are not mainly responsible 
for the care of newborn children. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland law says state employees who are ``primary'' caregivers  
can get 12 weeks parental leave. But that law doesn't clearly 
define what a ``primary'' caregiver is, Hoffman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law mandates up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave a year for  
occasions such as the birth or adoption of a child or the need to 
care for a sick relative. The law applies to workers in state 
agencies or companies with large numbers of employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The presiding judge earlier denied Knussman's request to seek  
reparations from the state, but allowed him to seek damages from 
individuals if he shows they violated his rights. Defendants 
include three of Knussman's superiors and a police administrator. 
</P>
<P>
	Knussman's wife suffered a late-pregnancy complication that  
includes high blood pressure, swelling and kidney problems. Doctors 
said she needed several weeks of bed rest after the birth of their 
daughter, Cockey said. The mother was eventually hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Knussman) was taking care of his child and he was taking care  
of his sick wife,'' Cockey said. ``He was the primary provider.''

	CHICAGO (AP) -- Jose Hernandez, who played seven different  
positions last season, agreed to a one-year contract with the 
Chicago Cubs today, avoiding salary arbitration.

	Hernandez batted .254 with career highs in homers (23) and RBIs  
(75). The five-year veteran, who came to the Cubs in a 1993 trade 
with the Indians, played mostly at third base and shortstop. He 
also had time in left field, center field, first base, second base 
and right field.

<HEADLINE> New-Car Dealers Decline in Number </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The number of franchised new-car dealerships  
declined last year at the fastest rate in five years as 
consolidation by major automakers and dealership chains 
accelerated, a trade association reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The total number of dealerships in the United States fell by 200  
to an estimated 22,400 last year, with the sharpest decline among 
the lowest-volume dealers, according to figures recently released 
by the National Automobile Dealers Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``The desire to take advantage of economies of scale is a major  
force behind the industry's consolidation movement,'' the 
association's chief economist, Tom Webb, said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the consolidation last year was due to the growth of  
privately owned chains, which now represent 40 percent of all 
franchised dealerships, association spokesman Mike Morrissey said 
Tuesday. At the beginning of this year there were 2,900 dealer 
chains, 100 more than at the start of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Publicly owned chains, such as Republic Industries Inc.,  
represent 2 percent of all dealerships but own some of the largest 
and most profitable stores. After an aggressive dealership-buying 
spree in 1997 and 1998, Republic is trying to sell some of its 
lower-volume franchises. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. also have been trying to  
reduce the number of their franchises as part of a campaign to 
upgrade their retail networks and make those dealers that remain 
more profitable. 
</P>
<P>
	The association says the number of dealerships selling fewer  
than 150 new vehicles a year declined 3 percent in 1998, compared 
with a decline of just under 1 percent for all dealerships. The 
number of those selling more than 750 vehicles last year increased 
2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. dealership total declined by 200 from 1995 to 1998.  
From 1990 through 1992, during the last industry recession, the net 
dealership decline averaged 600 a year.

<HEADLINE> Writer Held in Okla. Bomb Aftermath </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Complaining he is being persecuted for  
``speaking the truth,'' a writer who has advanced conspiracy 
theories about the Oklahoma bombing surrendered Tuesday to face 
charges he tried to influence a grand jury investigating the blast. 
</P>
<P>
	David Hoffman, 38, reported to the Oklahoma County Jail, three  
weeks after being indicted by the grand jury on two misdemeanor 
counts of attempting to influence a juror. He was released from 
jail Tuesday afternoon. If convicted, he could get two years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman, who runs an alternative San Francisco newspaper, the  
Haight-Ashbury Free Press, and wrote ``The Oklahoma City Bombing 
and The Politics of Terror,'' is accused of sending a copy of his 
book and a note to an alternate member of the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, the note says, ``do not let them tell you  
what to do, and do not take your cues from them. It you do, you 
will be making a grave mistake, and shortchanging the people of 
this nation,'' according to an affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman says he didn't try to contact grand jurors directly and  
accused Oklahoma County District Attorney Bob Macy of persecuting 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Macy ``has put 53 people on death row, some of whom he knew to  
be innocent,'' Hoffman said as he was taken inside the jail. ``Now 
he's trying to prosecute a lowly reporter for speaking the truth 
about a crime he was charged to investigate but failed to do so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The April 19, 1995, bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal  
Building killed 168 people. Hoffman has claimed that the government 
was involved in the attack or knew about it advance. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury met for 18 months. In its final report last  
month, it dismissed allegations of a larger conspiracy or a 
government cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman called the grand jury investigation ``the biggest  
government cover-up since the Kennedy assassination.''

<HEADLINE> Bush: Medicare May be Broke by 2008 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Medicare could be broke by the year 2008 -- and  
Social Security after that -- unless the system is changed, former 
President George Bush warned. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American symbol is an eagle, not an ostrich and now is not  
the time to go burying our heads in the sand,'' Bush said Monday at 
a workshop sponsored by the Committee for a Responsible Federal 
Budget and American Express Financial Advisors. 
</P>
<P>
	The workshop is one of 10 being held across the country to  
elicit debate about keeping the nation's two largest entitlement 
programs afloat. 
</P>
<P>
	Without action by lawmakers, Medicare could go broke within nine  
years, with Social Security following suit about 2032, Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We shouldn't be waiting for the big problems to fall into our  
laps,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	The former president said he didn't want to offer his opinion on  
what Congress should do because it might pressure his sons -- 
Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Texas Gov. George W. Bush -- to follow his 
philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
	George W. Bush has been touted as a potential presidential  
candidate in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the problem of endangered federal entitlements rests  
with President Clinton, who has asked Congress to consider devoting 
the 1999 budget surplus -- $76 billion -- to fix Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers have not reached a consensus over how to fix the  
program.

secret had been discovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, it can be told: He never expected to get another chance at

came to Atlanta was make this a respectable team, hopefully one 
that would consistently go to the playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The linebacker will join a group of players who have taken part  
in five Super Bowls when the Falcons play in their first, meeting 
the Denver Broncos at Miami's Pro Player Stadium on Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one player will have more title games. Denver defensive  
tackle Mike Lodish, a former teammate of Bennett's during four 
Super Bowls with the Buffalo Bills, will be making his second 
straight appearance with the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	Lodish finally earned a championship ring last year when Denver  
upset Green Bay. Bennett has yet to be part of a winning Super Bowl 
team, suffering through four straight losses by the Bills from 
1991-94. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe that's why he had such a fire in his eyes, but a tinge of  
desperation in his voice as he celebrated in the locker room 
following Atlanta's 30-27 victory over Minnesota in the NFC 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Give me a hug, big fellow,'' he told teammate Gene Williams,  
yanking the lineman into an emotional embrace. ``Let's go down to 
Miami and win this thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Bennett signed with the Falcons in 1996, his unspoken goals  
were modest. It would have been inappropriate to speak his mind at 
the time, but the Super Bowl wasn't on the list. Not in Atlanta. 
Not after three decades of mediocrity. 
</P>
<P>
	``To have a chance to get to the Super Bowl?'' he repeated.  
``No, I couldn't realistically say that I expected this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 33, Bennett feels fortunate to have another chance under any  
circumstances. His career was in doubt after he pleaded guilty to 
sexual misconduct and spent more than a month in jail during the 
offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	The case stemmed from a May 1997 sexual encounter in a Buffalo  
hotel room. Bennett, who is married, was charged after the victim 
was treated for trauma and skin cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett entered counseling and became a born-again Christian,  
serving his sentence with the help of a Bible. According to his 
teammates and coach Dan Reeves, the linebacker emerged from jail 
with a different outlook on life. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the beginning of the season, I was so thankful that coach  
Reeves kept me on this team,'' Bennett said. ``He believed in me, 
so now I have to contribute to make this a good team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett, a Pro Bowl alternate, led the Falcons with 120 tackles  
this season, also breaking up eight passes and recovering two 
fumbles. After a dismal first season in Atlanta, when the team was 
3-13, he has spent the past two years spearheading a defensive 
revitalization. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even with some of the things that happened to him in the  
offseason, he bounced back,'' linebacker Jessie Tuggle said. ``It's 
almost like he's a changed person now. He works very hard. He keeps 
the team motivated. He's a leader. He gives it everything he has.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons, one of the league's worst defensive teams for most  
of the decade, ranked second against the run, fourth in points 
allowed and eighth in total defense this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Their most impressive performance came Sunday in the NFC  
championship game. Atlanta surrendered points to the high-scoring 
Vikings on their first four possessions, then allowed only one 
touchdown over the final 44:37 of the overtime game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is going to take time for us to get some credit,'' Bennett  
said. ``People are going to say that we don't deserve to be in the 
Super Bowl. If we win the Super Bowl, people are going to say we 
were lucky. But all of it counts. People tend to call it luck. I 
call it faith.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett considered retirement after each of the last two  
seasons, but now talks like a player who plans to hang around for a 
few more years. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the fun stops, no matter what the pay is, you'll know  
it's time to sit down,'' said Bennett, finishing his 12th season. 
``But I'm enjoying it. When you're successful, you don't think 
about those things as much. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I don't see myself retiring anytime soon.''

<HEADLINE> Delta Profits Climb, Northwest Suffers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Delta Air Lines' profits climbed 2 percent in the last three  
months of 1998, benefiting from heavy holiday traveling. But 
Northwest Airlines suffered a $181.3 million loss due to a 15-day 
pilots strike, reversing a profit from a year earlier. 

</P>
<P>
 *Delta Air Lines    	
</P>
<P>
	The nation's third-largest airline reported Tuesday it earned  
$194 million, or $1.29 per diluted share, for its fiscal second 
quarter ended Dec. 31. Delta earned $190 million, or $1.20 per 
share, in the same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta-based Delta reported revenue of $3.45 billion, up  
slightly from $3.43 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The results topped analysts' expectations for earnings of $1.26  
per share, according to First Call Corp. But Delta shares were down 
31 1/4 cents at $25.93 3/4 in midday trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of its current fiscal year, profits  
rose to $520 million, or $3.38 per share, from $443 million, or 
$2.84 per share, in the first half of fiscal 1998. Revenue rose to 
$7.25 billion from $6.99 billion. 

</P>
<P>
 *Northwest Airlines    	
</P>
<P>
	The fourth-quarter loss at Northwest equaled $2.31 per diluted  
share and reversed a profit of $105.4 million, or 97 cents a share, 
in the final quarter of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue at the fourth-largest carrier dropped 11 percent to  
$2.21 billion from $2.49 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding costs related to the strike and other special charges,  
Northwest posted an operating loss of $1.49 per share, less than 
the $1.51-per-share loss analysts' had expected, according to First 
Call. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest shares were down 56 1/4 cents at $25.93 3/4 at midday on the  
Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest pilots staged a 15-day strike that ended Sept. 12, and  
it took several additional days before the Eagan, Minn.-based 
airline could fully restore its scheduled service. The company 
estimated its fourth-quarter pretax costs to recover from the 
strike were $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest has reached contract agreements with its smaller  
unions but is still in negotiations with unions representing 12,000 
flight attendants, 10,000 mechanics and cleaners and 15,000 other 
ground workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Also hindering fourth-quarter results was a $66 million pretax  
charge related to the retiring seven Boeing 747 aircraft and $36 
million in payments related to Northwest's collective bargaining 
agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, Northwest lost $285.5 million, or $3.48 per  
share, compared to profits of $596.5 million, or $5.21 per share, 
in 1997. Revenue fell to $9.04 billion from $10.22 billion.

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Brings Out Bad Blood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Founding Fathers were so worried about bad  
blood between the House and the Senate that they forbade the two 
bodies from even talking about each other. The impeachment trial in 
the Senate shows how right they were. 
</P>
<P>
	Breaking with custom, House prosecutors have been telling Senate  
jurors how to think and act. Their advice has not always gone over 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., got things off on a bad foot when he said  
in a New York Times interview last month that ``the senators' 
attention span is probably less than an average juror's so we'll 
need to simplify, simplify, simplify.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., retorted that ``that kind of  
condescending arrogance'' would not go over well in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, a strong supporter of  
impeachment, provoked another exchange when he suggested that 
senators study the ``reams of evidence'' in the Monica Lewinsky 
affair never made public. To tell the Senate what to do ``is not a 
helpful suggestion,'' said Sen. John Breaux, D-La. ``It will not be 
followed by the United States Senate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Jefferson appears to have foreseen this potential for  
discord. In parliamentary rules that he wrote, lawmakers are barred 
from commenting on the opposite chamber -- or even from referring to 
it directly. Jefferson's rules are still in effect in the House. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quoting them might beget reflections leading to a  
misunderstanding between the two houses,'' Jefferson wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The understanding was that there would always be tension between  
the House and the Senate. The House of Representatives, which 
always calls itself ``the people's House,'' is directly elected 
every two years and presumed to be more attuned to popular 
sentiment. The Senate, whose members originally were chosen by 
state legislatures, was presumed to be beholden to the interests of 
the states. 
</P>
<P>
	The purpose of the Senate, said Edmund Randolph, an early  
governor of Virginia, was to provide a cure for the ``turbulence 
and follies of democracy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers today must still refer to the group on the other side  
of the Capitol as ``the other body,'' and are admonished by the 
chair for speaking directly of the House or Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	At the opening of this session, House leaders, aware of the  
unusual situation created by the trial, announced that ``it is a 
general principle of comity that certain references to the Senate 
are to be avoided'' and members are ``prohibited from urging the 
Senate to undertake a certain action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That reminder came after not only impeachment enthusiasts such  
as Barr and DeLay, but also the chairman of the House Judiciary 
Committee, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill. sniped at the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I daresay they are innovative and creative over there on Mount  
Olympus,'' he told his House colleagues, ``but here we're confined 
by the strictures of the Constitution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Henry Hyde is a fine human being,'' replied Sen. Bob  
Kerrey, D-Neb., during the debate over how the Senate should 
structure the trial, ``but I don't give a damn what he thinks our 
rules should be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most pungent remark came from Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, who,  
spoke of ``this pile of dung ... that a reckless, partisan House 
has handed us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The House members tend to think that the senators are prima  
donnas, that they really know very little about issues,'' said 
Roger Davidson, a political science professor at the University of 
Maryland. ``The senators tend to think that House members are 
anonymous and that they all secretly want to be senators.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Differences have narrowed now that senators, like House members,  
must raise money and run for re-election. But the House remains 
``the more raucous, more crowded body'' while senators, working in 
more intimate, slower-paced environs, develop the across-the-aisle 
friendships that make cooperation easier, Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said that in his 14 years in the House  
before his 1996 election to the Senate he was a frequent critic of 
Senate dawdling, but he now has a different perspective. 
</P>
<P>
	The House, he said, ``is at best a mob scene and is tough to  
manage.'' In contrast, the Senate is supposed to be more 
deliberative and reflective. ``We have to step back,'' he said, 
``and accept the fact that was by design.''

<HEADLINE> Slugger Sosa Honored at Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Home run hitter Sammy Sosa was in the  
bleachers Tuesday next to First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton to 
watch President Clinton deliver his State of the Union address to 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Cubs star and Mrs. Clinton, a Chicago native, met  
last October in the Dominican Republic, Sosa's homeland, where they 
were both involved in bringing relief to hurricane victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, a Cubs fan, also invited Sosa to preside over the  
lighting of the national Christmas tree last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, in his speech, noted that sports records are broken  
sooner or later but making other people's lives better was 
``something that lasts forever. So for far more than baseball, 
Sammy Sosa, you are a hero of two countries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa, receiving a standing ovation, made the gesture that has  
become his trademark, kissing his hand and thumping his heart. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa and Mark McGuire of the St. Louis Cardinals last season  
both smashed the Major League home record of 61 set by the Yankees' 
Roger Maris in 1961. McGuire finished with 70 home runs and Sosa 66 
for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side of Mrs. Clinton was Loc Truong, a 23-year-old  
Vietnam refugee and AmeriCorps member who mentors students at San 
Luis Obispo High School in California.

<HEADLINE>  2 Japan Banks in Tentative Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Two Japanese trust banks have tentatively agreed to  
merge in a sign that a long-awaited shakeout in this country's 
troubled financial industry may be picking up speed. 
</P>
<P>
	Executives from Japan's Chuo Trust &AMP; Banking Co. and Mitsui  
Trust &AMP; Banking Co. said at a press conference Tuesday they hope to 
complete the merger in April 2000. If the deal is completed, it 
would create a rival to the country's largest trust bank, 
Mitsubishi Trust &AMP; Banking Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike commercial banks catering to retail customers, trust  
banks specialize in managing funds for corporations, pensions and 
big individual investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal comes as Japanese banks struggle to dispose of heaps of  
bad loans left from the collapse of property prices nearly a decade 
ago. Many banks have been left holding land as collateral for 
soured loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Those loan problems and sweeping deregualtion in Japan's finance  
industry have prompted many banks to restructure or form alliances, 
often with foreign firms, in order to survive. 
</P>
<P>
	But the union of Mitsui and Chuo would be the first full merger  
involving major banks since the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd. was 
formed in 1996 to create a major commercial bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the final arrangements for the deal have not been  
finished, the banks tentatively agreed that one Mitsui Trust share 
would be exchanged for three-tenths of a Chuo Trust share, which 
would value the merger at 185 billion yen ($1.63 billion) as of the 
close of trading Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	At a press conference, Mitsui president Keiu Nishida and Chuo  
president Shozo Endo said that Chuo would lead the combined 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Together the banks would have assets of some 16 trillion yen  
($138 billion), second among trust banks only to Mitsubishi Trust 
and Banking, which has 18 trillion yen ($158 billion) in assets. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies had combined revenues of 1.14 trillion yen ($10  
billion) in the year ended last March. The new company would have 
170 branches nationwide and available funds of 41 trillion yen 
($360 billion). 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsui is currently Japan's third largest trust bank and Chuo  
the sixth-biggest. 
</P>
<P>
	The banks said they expect current tie-ups with foreign partners  
-- such as the alliance between State Street Trust &AMP; Banking Co. and 
Mitsui Trust -- will contribute to the merged bank.

<HEADLINE> Some Republicans Will Skip Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Several Republicans decided to boycott  
President Clinton's State of the Union address Tuesday, saying it 
was inappropriate for Clinton to appear before Congress during his 
impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president is demonstrating his lack of respect for the  
Congress,'' Reps. John Shadegg, R-Ariz., and Bob Schaffer, R-Colo., 
wrote in a letter to their GOP colleagues explaining why they 
wouldn't attend the speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not play a role in facilitating his disrespect,'' they  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Republicans, however, decided to follow the lead of new  
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., who wrote in a letter Friday 
that despite the ``discomfort,'' Congress had a duty to hear the 
views of the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``Out of respect for the office of the presidency, and for the  
state of our union, we will listen to the president's remarks 
soberly and with the dignity that befits the United States 
Congress,'' Hastert said. 
</P>
<P>
	There were also no reports of Democrats who planned to skip the  
speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Freshman Rep. Tom Tancredo, R-Colo., said he hadn't seen the  
Hastert letter when he decided not to attend the speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's incredibly inappropriate for the House to  
actually offer the invitation,'' he said. ``Didn't we just impeach 
the guy?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tancredo said he thought about having to stand up and applaud  
when the president enters the chamber, and ``I just couldn't do 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Whip Don Nickles, R-Okla., said Senate GOP  
attendance would match that in normal years. ``I figure we will 
have reluctant attendance,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	One senator who decided not to attend was Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H.  
His spokeswoman, Karen Lotter, said the senator thought it 
``inappropriate and awkward'' for the president to present his 
political agenda while he is on trial in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Also among those not attending was Rep. Bob Barr., R-Ga., one of  
the 13 House prosecutors in the Senate impeachment trial. His 
spokesman, Brad Alexander, said he was unsure if Barr's absence was 
related to the impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who has  
led the case seeking Clinton's removal from office, also decided 
not to attend. His spokesman, Sam Stratman, said Hyde usually stays 
away because he's not comfortable in large crowds. 
</P>
<P>
	He quoted Hyde as saying he would ``leap to my feet in applause  
in the comfort of my living room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another senior Republican, Rep. John Boehner of Ohio, decided to  
skip the speech, but his spokesman said it had nothing to do with 
the impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Boehner was in Hawaii with his wife celebrating their 25th  
wedding anniversary.

<HEADLINE> Castro Lashes Out at U.S. Gov't </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- President Fidel Castro used a gathering of  
international economists to lash out Tuesday at the United States, 
accusing it of acting like a world government that exerts economic 
and military control around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have imposed upon us a world government,'' Castro said  
during the second day of a five-day meeting of economists he is 
sponsoring here. ``We are against this world government and must 
pay the consequences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Castro's statements came during a daylong series of speeches by  
economists criticizing economic globalization and the world 
financial crisis they say it has caused. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban president criticized the U.S. government's ability to  
pressure the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund -- 
lending institutions underwritten by Western financial powers that 
developing nations turn to for loans and credits in times of 
financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Castro also blasted ``this world government'' for ``tossing  
bombs to the right and to the left without asking anyone'' -- an 
apparent reference to the recent attacks on Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	Castro proposed the forum last year, as the financial crisis was  
spreading across Asia. It hit Brazil in August, when investors 
pulled their money out of the country for fear that it would 
default on its loans. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1980s, Cuba hosted similar economic forums on the  
foreign debt then weighing down Latin American nations and became a 
regional leader in support of foreign debt moratoriums. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of economists are attending the forum at Havana's  
Convention Palace. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the speakers and participants were from developing  
countries, primarily in Latin America. They included economists 
Theotonio Dos Santos of Brazil, Arturo Huerta of Mexico and Alfredo 
Eric Calcagno of Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
	Castro opposes free market policies and points to the current  
global financial crisis as proof of its harm to developing 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists fear that if Brazil succumbs to an Asian-style  
currency crisis, its economy -- Latin America's largest -- could 
infect and drag down other economies in the region.

<HEADLINE> New Weight-Loss Drug Called Safe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- An experimental drug that scientists hope is  
safer than the ill-fated Redux and fen-phen helped obese people 
shed pounds and keep them off, researchers reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Orlistat, trade-named Xenical, has been judged safe and  
effective for the U.S. market by an advisory panel to the Food and 
Drug Administration. The FDA usually follows advisers' 
recommendations, and the drug's manufacturer, Hoffmann-La Roche 
Inc., expects a decision soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Redux and Pondimin -- which is generically named fenfluramine and  
was paired with phentermine in ``fen-phen'' -- were recalled in 1997 
over concerns that they caused heart-valve damage. The only 
prescription weight-loss drugs left on the U.S. market are 
sibutramine, sold as Meridia, and phentermine. They regulate brain 
chemicals affecting appetite.

	Orlistat works differently. It blocks absorption of about  
one-third of fat that people consume, said one of the study's 
authors, Dr. Steven Heymsfield of St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Four out of every five people report such side effects as  
intestinal cramping, gas and oily or loose stools, but the problems 
usually subside, Heymsfield said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, some patients need vitamin supplements because  
orlistat also blocks some absorption of fat-soluble vitamins D, E 
and beta carotene, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A report on his two-year study, part of the data being  
considered by the FDA, was published in today's Journal of the 
American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, 892 obese adults were put on weight-loss diets,  
counseled about exercise and assigned to one of two groups for a 
year. The group given orlistat lost an average of 19 pounds, 
compared with about 12 pounds among those given dummy pills. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second year, every orlistat taker was put on a  
weight-maintenance diet. Some were continued on full doses of 
orlistat. Some were given half doses and the rest were given dummy 
pills. 
</P>
<P>
	The full-dose takers regained only 35 percent of their lost  
weight, compared with 51 percent among half-dose takers and 63 
percent among placebo takers. 
</P>
<P>
	A researcher not involved in the study said orlistat's benefits  
were modest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Will the yet-to-be-proven health benefits of these drugs be  
generalizable to any but a small minority of obese patients?'' 
asked David Williamson of the federal Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	Williamson wrote in an editorial accompanying the study that any  
weight-loss approach seems unlikely to work unless Americans change 
their attitudes about exercising and eating. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no magic bullet,'' Heymsfield agreed. ``Losing weight  
and keeping it off for a long time is hard work. And we know that 
the cornerstone of that is still diet and exercise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Orlistat is available in parts of Europe and Latin America.  
Studies on about 4,000 people worldwide have found an increased 
risk of breast cancer, although Heymsfield said his work found no 
connection. 
</P>
<P>
	But since people may take the drug much longer than two years,  
Heymsfield said, ``it's very important to continue that 
surveillance of any kind of side effects to avoid another fen-phen 
type of problem.''

<HEADLINE>  2 Japan Banks in Tentative Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Two Japanese trust banks have tentatively agreed to  
merge in a sign that a long-awaited shakeout in this country's 
troubled financial industry may be picking up speed. 
</P>
<P>
	Executives from Japan's Chuo Trust &AMP; Banking Co. and Mitsui  
Trust &AMP; Banking Co. said at a press conference Tuesday they hope to 
complete the merger in April 2000. If the deal is completed, it 
would create a rival to the country's largest trust bank, 
Mitsubishi Trust &AMP; Banking Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike commercial banks catering to retail customers, trust  
banks specialize in managing funds for corporations, pensions and 
big individual investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal comes as Japanese banks struggle to dispose of heaps of  
bad loans left from the collapse of property prices nearly a decade 
ago. Many banks have been left holding land as collateral for 
soured loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Those loan problems and sweeping deregualtion in Japan's finance  
industry have prompted many banks to restructure or form alliances, 
often with foreign firms, in order to survive. 
</P>
<P>
	But the union of Mitsui and Chuo would be the first full merger  
involving major banks since the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd. was 
formed in 1996 to create a major commercial bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the final arrangements for the deal have not been  
finished, the banks tentatively agreed that one Mitsui Trust share 
would be exchanged for three-tenths of a Chuo Trust share, which 
would value the merger at 185 billion yen ($1.63 billion) as of the 
close of trading Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	At a press conference, Mitsui president Keiu Nishida and Chuo  
president Shozo Endo said that Chuo would lead the combined 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Together the banks would have assets of some 16 trillion yen  
($138 billion), second among trust banks only to Mitsubishi Trust 
and Banking, which has 18 trillion yen ($158 billion) in assets. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies had combined revenues of 1.14 trillion yen ($10  
billion) in the year ended last March. The new company would have 
170 branches nationwide and available funds of 41 trillion yen 
($360 billion). 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsui is currently Japan's third largest trust bank and Chuo  
the sixth-biggest. 
</P>
<P>
	The banks said they expect current tie-ups with foreign partners  
-- such as the alliance between State Street Trust &AMP; Banking Co. and 
Mitsui Trust -- will contribute to the merged bank.
