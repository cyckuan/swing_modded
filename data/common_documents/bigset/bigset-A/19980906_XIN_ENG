<HEADLINE> Chinese, S. Koreans Dominate Asian Badminton Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The curtain of the 1998 JVC
Asian Badminton Championships came down Saturday night, with
Chinese and South Koreans being the largest winners of the
13,600-U.S. dollar prize money.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese showed their strength in singles matches and the
women's doubles, while the Koreans were strong in the mixed and
men's doubles.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's finals began with mixed doubles. South Korea's Kim
Dong Moon and Ra Kyung Min, top seed in the championships, proved
to be too strong for Chinese Sun Jun and Ge Fei.
</P>
<P>
The Koreans snatched the first gold medal of this tournament
with a convincing two-game victory of 15-5, 15-8 over their
Chinese opponents.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese stormed back in the next three matches of the
men's singles, the women's singles and doubles.
</P>
<P>
Chen Gang of China met Indonesian Marleve Mainaky in the men's
singles final. The latter beat Sun Jun, the world No. 2 and
All-England champion in the quarter final matches.
</P>
<P>
However, Mainaky was obviously not in the mood Saturday night
when his rival Chen Gang impressed a good crowd with powerful
smashes and effective drop shots.
</P>
<P>
Chen was in high spirit and won an easy victory of 15-6 and
15-9.
</P>
<P>
The following two finals were held between Chinese women, as
world No.1 Ye Zhaoying beat her compatriot Gong Zhichao 11-5 and
13-12 in women's singles and also world No. 1 Ge Fei/Gu Jun
overpowered Qin Yiyuan/Tang Hetian 15-8, 15-7.
</P>
<P>
The last final of the men's doubles between Chinese Zhang
Jun/Zhang Wei and South Koreans Kang Kyung Jin/Ha Tae Kwon was
surely the most exciting and hard-fought one among all the five
finals held Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
The level of the two teams was quite even, though the Koreans
enjoyed advantages in their heights.
</P>
<P>
The quick-moving Chinese wrapped up the first game 15-12, but
the Koreans finally shocked the Chinese with a dramatic
come-from-behind victory of 15-11 and 15-13 in the second and
third games.

<HEADLINE> IMF Okays Extended Credit for Ukraine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) announced here Saturday the approval of a three-year
credit for Ukraine, equivalent to 2.226 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The credit, under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF), is provided
to back the government's 1998-2001 economic program. About 257
million dollars is available immediately.
</P>
<P>
In its economic program, Ukraine is expected to achieve 4
percent growth in the gross domestic production by 2001 from -0.3
percent in 1997, to bring inflation down to 7 percent by 2001 from
10 percent in 1997, and to achieve gross international reserves
equivalent to 7 weeks of import cover in 2001 from 6.3 weeks in
1997.
</P>
<P>
The EFF is an IMF financing facility that supports medium-term
programs that seek to overcome balance of payments difficulties
stemming from macroeconomic imbalances and structural problems.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine joined the IMF in September, 1992. Its quota is about
1.349 billion dollars and its outstanding use of IMF credit
currently totals about 2.444 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Pak-Indian Differences on Resuming Talks Narrowed: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz said on Saturday that Pakistan and India have
"narrowed down the procedural differences" on the resumption of
bilateral talks.
</P>
<P>
Foreign secretaries of the two countries met on the sidelines
of the Non-aligned Movement Summit in South Africa and narrowed
down the procedural differences on the resumption of dialogue as
"India appear to have realized that issues of peace and security
and the Kashmir dispute need to be addressed on priority basis,"
Aziz told reporters upon his arrival from Durban, South Africa,
Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
The foreign secretaries, who met at Durban, will submit their
respective recommendations to their prime ministers, he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime ministers of the two countries will "hold more
substantive discussions" on the resumption of talks when they meet
at the U.N. General Assembly session in New York in September, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He underscored that there has to be a time schedule for
discussion on issues, saying "we will have to have a timetable and
sequence."
</P>
<P>
Islamabad, he reiterated, wants constructive, positive and
result-oriented discussions on the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister regretted that India has not shown the
"sincerity and seriousness" with which the Kashmir dispute should
be addressed.
</P>
<P>
"It is not just agreeing on modalities of the groups and the
kind of negotiations that will take place but the sincerity of
dealing (with) the actual issue."

<HEADLINE> India Resolves Differences with Pakistan on Peace Talks: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee said that his country and Pakistan had resolved
their differences over how to resume stalled peace talks between
the two arch-rivals in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival in the Indian capital from an eight-day tour
of Oman, Namibia, South Africa and Mauritius, Vajpayee told
reporters that New Delhi would discuss all outstanding issues
including Jammu and Kashmir with Islamabad at the bilateral level
without any third party intervention.
</P>
<P>
A foreign ministry spokesman said Saturday that the
breakthrough came in meetings between Pakistani Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz and members of the Indian delegation on the sidelines
of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) summit this week in Durban,
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued at the airport, Vajpayee said there had
been forward movement in discussions between the Indian and
Pakistani delegations in Durban.
</P>
<P>
The scheduled meeting between Vajpayee and Pakistani Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif during the NAM summit were canceled at the
last minute because of "pressing engagements at home" of the
Pakistani leader.
</P>
<P>
Aziz, who represented Sharif at the NAM summit, had separate
meetings with Vajpayee and Indian Minister of State for External
Affairs Vasundhara Raje.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee was quoted as saying after the meeting that foreign
secretaries of the two countries had agreed on how to proceed with
their dialogue, which broke down last September over the issue of
Kashmir. Pakistan insisted that Kashmir be dealt with in a
separate working group, while India was adamant that it must be
part of wide-ranging dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministry spokesman said that "final instructions
will be given by the two prime ministers when they meet in New
York during the United Nations General Assembly later this month.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee and Sharif first met in Sri Lanka at the end of July
which produced little results as both sides blamed each other for
the continued standoff.
</P>
<P>
India and Pakistan fought three wars since their independence
from Britain in 1947, two of them over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
India rejects any third party involvement in resolving the
dispute, while Pakistan wants an internationally supervised
referendum to determine whether the region should be folded into
India or Pakistan.

AMMAN, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Japan has agreed to grant Jordan
63 million U.S. dollars to help double the drinking water supply

<HEADLINE> President Jiang Tours Flooded Areas of Northeastern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, September 5 (Xinhua)-- President Jiang Zemin has urged
earnest efforts to help people in the flooded areas cope with
difficulties. In northeastern China, he said, the priority is to
make sure people survive the coming winter.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks today in Qiqihar, Heilongjiang
Province, which was the third stop on a fact-finding tour which
began on Thursday in the flood-ravaged regions.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also general secretary of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China and chairman of the Central Military
Commission, visited evacuation camps in Tailai, a county that was
hit hard by flooding.
</P>
<P>
Jiang inquired about the lives of local people, including their
food supply and shelter. He also asked if they had warm clothing
for the coming winter and access to medical treatment. He also
asked if teachers had resumed classes and about preparations for
the resumption of farming.
</P>
<P>
The raging floods on the Nenjiang and Songhua rivers in
Heilongjiang Province inundated 2.67 million hectares of crops and
affected 8.5 million people.
</P>
<P>
In Toulihe, one of the townships seriously damaged by the
floods, 700 people are still living on the dikes in tents or
makeshift shelters provided by the local government.
</P>
<P>
Jiang visited several families and chatted with people. He said
he was relieved to know that the daily needs of these people
basically were being met. But the president stressed that local
government should waste no time in making proper arrangements to
help people cope with the coming winter which should arrive in
about a month.
</P>
<P>
"People will begin reconstruction and resume farm production
only when they are properly settled," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
In Harbin, the provincial capital, Jiang met with soldiers
stationed there who have played a major role in fighting the
floods and extended his warm regards.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli cabinet ministers
have criticized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for blocking them
knowledge of recent talks with the Palestinians, Israel Radio
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
National Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon and Industry and
Trade Minister Natan Sharansky complained that they were not
informed of the talks involving Netanyahu and Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai and yielding a draft agreement.
</P>
<P>
The radio said they will demand Netanyahu to give explanations
at the weekly cabinet meeting Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians reportedly held 10 rounds of
high-level talks in the last two weeks and reached a draft
agreement on key issues, including the scope of Israel's further
withdrawal from the West Bank, security cooperation, operation of
a Palestinian airport and a seaport in Gaza and Israel's release
of Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Television Channel One reported Friday night that
Israel has made some "serious concessions" prior to the visit by
the United States Middle East envoy Dennis Ross next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It said that Israel will no longer insist that the Palestinian
National Authority hand over the Palestinians who are alleged to
kill Israelis, reduce the size of its police forces and confiscate
weapons of Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
But the Jewish state still demands the Palestinian National
Council be re-convened to annul the Palestinian Covenant which
calls for destruction of Israel, the television said.

<P>
JERUSALEM, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Four Palestinians and five
Israeli police were injured in clashes Saturday at Shufat Refugee
Camp, Israel Radio said.
</P>
<P>
The clashes erupted at about noon Saturday between the
Palestinian youths and Israeli police when an Israeli ambulance,
called to pick up a Palestinian patient inside the camp, north
of Jerusalem, refused to enter the camp without an escort by
the Israeli police.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian patient died of heart attack at the refugee
clinic due to the untimely treatment and this angered the
Palestinian youths. They threw stones at the ambulance and
Israeli police and the police fired rubber bullets and tear
gas into the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
As a result, five Israeli police and four Palestinians were
injured. Among the injured Palestinians, a 45-year-old woman was
in critical condition as she was shot in the throat.
</P>
<P>
Later, more Israeli police and border guards were called to
the camp to check the violence, the radio added.

<HEADLINE> Independent Palestinian State to Be Announced Next </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat called on the Palestinians to get well prepared for the
announcement of an independent Palestinian state next May.
</P>
<P>
Arafat repeated the call Saturday during his inspection of
Hebron, a Palestinian controlled city in southern West Bank, the
Voice of Palestine said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, Chairman of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA),
said that he was concerned about the situation in Hebron and
promised that the PNA will do its best to help the Hebron
residents to overcome the difficulties caused by Israel's closure
of the city.
</P>
<P>
Following the killing of Israeli settler Rabbi Shlomo Raanan
in Hebron on August 20, Israeli security forces imposed an
eight-day closure to the city. The closure caused economic losses
and a shortage of food and water to the city residents.
</P>
<P>
On Friday evening, Arafat presided over a weekly meeting of
the Palestinian leadership in the city, which discussed the
preparation of the announcement of an independent Palestinian
state on the territories on May 4, 1999, the end of the five-year
interim period, a deal struck with the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The meeting decided to set up preparation committees both on
the territories and abroad to contact the Arab nations and
Israeli organizations supporting the peace process to win their
support for an independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also expressed its welcome to U.S. President
Bill Clinton's decision to move the Middle East peace process
forward and the return to the region of U.S. peace envoy
Dennis Ross next week.
</P>
<P>
The meeting urged the Israeli side to immediately accept the
U.S. peace initiative which backs Israel to hand over 13.1
percent of the West Bank territories to the Palestinians during
the second stage troop redeployment.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Urges World Community to Reject confederation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides Saturday urged the international community to reject
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash's proposal on creating a
confederation in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
If the world community views the proposal as not forming a
basis for discussion, it will then become a short-lived move,
Clerides told reporters upon returning from the Non-Aligned Summit
held in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said that he considered it possible and feasible to
reverse Denktash's positions, depending on the consistency of the
international community.
</P>
<P>
Denktash suggested last Monday a confederation composed of "two
sovereign and equal states" of the Turkish Cypriots and the Greek
Cypriots be established on the island.
</P>
<P>
Clerides flatly rejected the proposal soon after it was made
public, saying that under no circumstances can Denktash's proposal
form a basis for talks on the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Referring to his meeting with the United Nations Secretary
General Kofi Annan in Durban, South Africa, Clerides said that
Annan told him that "he is looking into some ideas which he will
discuss with me in New York later this month."
</P>
<P>
"We exchanged views on the reduction of tension, forces and on
demilitarization as well as on the substance of the Cyprus
question," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot president expressed satisfaction to a resolution
adopted by the Non-Aligned Summit, saying the resolution strongly
backs Cypriot government's position.
</P>
<P>
There is "keen interest" in the Cyprus question and "support"
for the Cypriot government among the Non-Aligned members, he said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third after a failed coup by the
Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared unilaterally in 1983 the
breakaway "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" recognized only by
Turkey against the internationally recognized Republic of Cyprus
dominated by the Greek Cypriots.

TUNIS, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Four African leaders arrived in
the Libyan capital Tripoli by air earlier today, violating the
U.N. air embargo on Libya, according to dispatches of the Libyan
News Agency reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Presidents of Niger Ibrahim Barre Mainassara, Chad Idriss Deby,
Mali Alpha Oumar Konare and Sudan Omar Al-Bashir arrived at the
Tripoli International Airport aboard national aircraft of their
countries.
</P>
<P>
The four leaders aim to attend the Libyan celebrations marking
the anniversary of the September 1 Revolution and to congratulate
their Libyan counterpart Colonel Moammar Gaddafi on his recovery
from the recent surgery.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi had broken left femur while practicing some routine
sport exercises.
</P>
<P>
The decision of the four African leaders to defy the air embargo
on Libya is in line with the resolutions of the Organization of
African Unity summit which was held in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso,
in June.
</P>
<P>
The summit decided to stop compliance with the embargo as of
September 1. The embargo was imposed on Libya in 1992 after Libya
refused to hand over the two Libyans suspected of involvement in
the bombing of an American airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland in
1988.

TUNIS, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Tunis Stock Exchange continued
its upward tendency over the last week as the general index went
up by 0.51 percent to close at 462.95 points at the last session
of the week, compared with 460.59 points on the previous Friday.
</P>
<P>
The weekly bulletin of the exchange reported on Saturday that
the main firms whose shares rose in value are Sofi Sikaf by 9.40
percent, the Tunisian Co. of the Bank by 6.77 percent, and the
Tunisian Co. for Dairy Products by 5.88 percent.
</P>
<P>
The activity of the exchange during the week was marked by

500,000 dinars (one US dollar is worth 1.15 Tunisian dinars)
except for the Friday session that witnessed a heated bond trading.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Won't Send Troops to Congo (K), Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba said here Saturday that his government will never send
troops to intervene the civil war in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Chiluba made the remark before he left for Swaziland to attend
the country's 30th anniversary of independence which falls on
September 6.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba added that Zambia remains committed to a cease-fire
and the only troops that would be sent to the DRC are those who
could monitor the process.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that Zambia, along with its neighbors
such as Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia, sent troops to the former
Zaire to help Kabila fight the rebels last month when the capital
city of Kinshasa was under attack.
</P>
<P>
Several thousand troops from Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia
entered the DRC in mid-August to rescue Kabila's regime and they
re-captured the Congo River corridor from the rebels after nearly
10 days' offensive.
</P>
<P>
However, Chiluba denied the report and insisted his country
was looking for a peaceful solution to its northern neighbor's
war and calling for a cease-fire in that country.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here Saturday, Zimbabwean
President Robert Mugabe will host a peace summit on the DRC war
which will attract Kabila's military allies Zimbabwe, Angola and
Namibia as well as rebel leaders and Uganda and Rwanda, both have
denied Kabila's accusations that they are backing the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The peace summit scheduled for Monday in the resort town of
Victoria Falls will focus on spearheading a cease-fire and the
withdrawal of allied forces in the war-torn country, said
Zimbabwe's state news agency ZIANA.

<HEADLINE> Bad Gene Linked To Pancreatitis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The genetic defect that
causes cystic fibrosis also appears to be involved in
inflammation of the pancreas, according to a Washington Post
report.
</P>
<P>
Two new studies provide the first solid evidence that chronic
pancreatitis may be linked to a bad gene. Researchers estimate
that the cystic fibrosis gene may play a role in about 10
percent to 15 percent of these cases, even though victims show
no signs of cystic fibrosis itself.
</P>
<P>
By far the leading cause of pancreatitis is alcohol abuse.
But in about 30 percent of cases there is no clear cause. The
new work suggests that between one-third and one-half of these
unexplained cases may be triggered-- at least-- by the cystic
fibrosis gene.
</P>
<P>
The new studies were directed by researchers at Duke
University in Durham,N.C., and the Manchester Royal Infirmary in
England and published in New England Journal of Medicine.

security and stability in the Gulf region.
</P>

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Professor Earnest Wamba
dia Wamba, political leader of the rebels in the civil war of the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), has been sacked by the
University of Dar es Salaam where he holds a post.
</P>
<P>
Chief administrative officer of the university, Prof. Daniel
Mkunde, told the media in Dar es Salaam Saturday that Wamba has
been absent from duty since August 9 and his salary of that month
has been frozen.
</P>
<P>
Wamba had requested permission to leave for "attending a
meeting" between July 25 and August 9. However, he failed to come
back in time, Mkunde said.
</P>
<P>
Mkunde said the decision was in line with standing rules of
employment which states that if an employee is absent from duty
without acceptable reasons for a specified period, he or she
automatically loses the job.
</P>
<P>
The dismissal of Wamba will be taken to the Appointment
Committee for Academic Staff as a matter of procedure. However,
he did not say when the committee will have a meeting over it.
</P>
<P>
Mkunde said the university wrote Wamba a letter on August 20,
asking him to account for his absence and three days later he
responded but did not address the issue of absence.
</P>
<P>
Wamba said in his letter to the university that he was called
home for a noble task and that he could not notify the varsity
authorities for shortage of time as the matter was urgent.
</P>
<P>
"As you know, it is not possible to return to Dar es Salaam
now. I ask for extension of absence until end of September," part
of Wamba's letter reads.
</P>
<P>
Wamba, who is a history professor and has a deep grounding in
philosophy, was picked last month to be the political leader of
the coalition forces fighting against government troops.
</P>
<P>
It is said that Wamba went through a rough terrain during the
era of dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. He was once placed behind bars
for being active in the opposition camp.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Deputy Prime Minister
Bulent Ecevit said Saturday that the Turkish Cypriot proposal to
create a confederation with the Greek Cypriots is the last chance
to prevent an eternal partition of the island.
</P>
<P>
Any settlement of the Cyprus problem should be based on "the
fact that the Turkish Cypriots are equal by all means to the Greek
Cypriots," Ecevit said in the Turkish Cypriot-controlled northern
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish official arrived there early in the day for a
one-day visit, Turkey's Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
There are "two sovereign states" in Cyprus, Ecevit said.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash proposed last Monday that
a confederation of "equal and sovereign states" of the Turkish
Cypriots and the Greek Cypriots be established as "a final effort"
to end the 24-year-old division of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government has flatly rejected the proposal,
dismissing it as an attempt to render an independent sovereign
state into two protectorates.
</P>
<P>
Years have been wasted with the Greek Cypriots paying "lip
service" to a federal settlement on the island, but consolidating
their military, economic and political integration with Greece,
Ecevit said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Ecevit, then
Turkish prime minister, ordered Turkey's troops to land on Cyprus

denied that Jordan is trying to build military alliance with
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Jordan rejects entering any military alliance, but "will use
the strong relations (with Turkey) for the benefit of the Arab

CAIRO, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic
briefs from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The creditor banks have unanimously rejected a request
by the managers of the Jordan Tobacco and Cigarettes Company
(JTCC) for liquidation as a result of sluggish sales and ensuing
heavy debts, the semi-official Jordan Times reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a recent meeting, major creditor banks, including the Arab
Bank, the Jordan Investment and Finance Bank, the Grindlays Bank,
the Jordan and Gulf Bank and the Cairo Amman Bank, voiced their
refusal of JTCC's liquidation request.
</P>
<P>
The banks are scheduled on Sunday to ask the government to
recover or guarantee the 12 million Jordanian dinars (about 17
million U.S. dollars) worth of debts that the company owed to
them.
</P>
<P>
In a memorandum to be presented on Sunday to Minister of
Industry, Trade and Supply Mohammad Saleh Hourani, the banks also
make a proposal to salvage JTCC, the kingdom's oldest cigarette
company -- to restructure its capital and allow the banks to
become it's shareholders.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, if adopted, will change the identity of the
JTCC, which is mainly owned by the Jordan Investment Corporation,
the government's major investment organization, and regulated by
the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Supply.

<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanon's state-run power company Electricite du
Liban (EDL) has approved the pre-qualification of 11 companies
from the United States and Europe for consultancy work on a power
project.
</P>
<P>
The 200 million-U.S. dollar project will link the Homs natural
gas refinery in Syria to the power plants of Deir Ammar and
Zahrani on the Lebanese coast.
</P>
<P>
EDL said that it would formally invite bids for the project,
with November 23 set as the deadline.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanese Minister of State for Financial Affairs Fuad
Sinyoura has promised to work to reverse import restrictions and
modify customs duties on a number of food products, according to a
leading business man.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with Sinyoura last Saturday, Salim Halwani,
head of the association of meat, fish and frozen vegetable
importers and exporters, said that the minister has promised to
raise with cabinet the issue of reversing the agriculture
ministry' ban on importing frozen chicken and potatoes.
</P>
<P>
Halwani said Sinyoura would also look into reducing customs
duties on meat from 6 percent to 2 percent to bring it in line
with those in livestock imports.

MARAKESH, MOROCCO -- A World Bank (WB) working paper submitted
to the Mediterranean Development Forum estimates the cost of
projects for the combat of poverty in the Middle East and Africa
at about 14 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to Sunday's Arab daily "Al Hayat," in the working
paper, the WB stated that providing financial services to the poor
will probably help increase family income, reduce unemployment and
create demand for goods and services particularly foodstuffs,
education and health.
</P>
<P>
The forum has examined for three consecutive days the role of
non-governmental organizations, the civil community and the
private sector in combating poverty prevailing in the Middle East
and Africa.

<HEADLINE> More Jordanians in Extreme Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Jordanians living in extreme
poverty climbed to 8 to 11 percent of Jordan's total population in
1997, a 6.5 to 9.5 increase compared with the figures in 1986,
according to a census published Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In Jordan, with a population of 4.6 million, families earning
less than 106 U.S. dollars a month are classified as extreme poor.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the census, conducted by the state-run Irbid
University, said that 21 to 22 percent of Jordanians, whose
families have a monthly income of below 170 dollars, lived in
absolute poverty in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Jordan Times has reported that almost a
third of the kingdom`s total population live under the general
poverty line, with the family income below 210 dollars a month.
</P>
<P>
The census report attributed the expanded poverty to a
snail-paced regional economy, which, in fact, hindered Jordan's
economic development, incurring more unemployment and decreasing
people's income by a big margin.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's annual population growth rate is 3.6 percent, among
the highest in the world.
</P>
<P>
The official unemployment rate in 1998 is put at 15 percent
while at 26 percent by independent sources.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientist: Ice Ages Result of Celestial Crashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese scientist today
claimed that the six ice ages in the Cenozoic Era resulted from
collisions between minor celestial bodies and the earth.
</P>
<P>
Ouyang Ziyuan, a Chinese academician attending the ongoing
Sixth International Symposium on Antarctic Glaciology in this
capital of northwest China's Gansu Province, said that the
formation of the glacial epoch 65 million years ago, which caused
the extinction of 60 percent of all living things on the earth at
that time, including the dinosaurs, has long been a mystery for
scientists worldwide.
</P>
<P>
"Actually, there were a total of six such glacial epochs during
the Cenozoic Era, dating back about 65 million, 34 million, 15
million, 23 million, one million and 730,000 years ago," Ouyang
said, adding that the ages were formed after six minor celestial
bodies crashed into the earth, respectively, which also had a
great influence on changes in the world's climate and environment.
</P>
<P>
Based on scientific research and reliable statistics on the
subject, Ouyang submitted evidence that each collision coincided
the start of a corresponding glacial epoch.
</P>
<P>
According to geological and chemical data, the speed of each
celestial body would have been 15 km to 17 km per second upon
impact, with an explosion power equal to millions of hydrogen
bombs, the expert pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The celestial bodies turned vaporized at the crash point,
turning into red-hot stones and gas 100 times larger than
themselves.
</P>
<P>
As a result, a thick layer of dust blocked the sunshine,
hampering photosynthesis on earth, and causing the extinction of
plants and then animals.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the consequent low temperature thickened and
enlarged the ice sheets on the earth, starting an ice age.
</P>
<P>
The dust in the atmosphere took tens of thousands to hundreds
of thousands of years to descend to the earth, returning the
climate to normal.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Participate in Bangladeshi Relief Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The United States is going to
take part in the massive relief operations for the millions of
flood victims in Bangladesh, a Foreign Ministry official said here
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Two American C-130 transport planes, which are scheduled to
take part in the U.S.-Bangladesh joint military exercise later
this week, will be used for air-dropping relief materials, Foreign
Secretary Mustafizur Rahman was quoted by the national BSS news
agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
About 40 persons from the U.S. will join the military exercise,
the 27th of its kind since 1991, mainly between the air forces of
the two countries, he said, adding that it was the U.S. side that
offered the service.
</P>
<P>
If necessary, aircraft would be sought from other friendly
countries to help conduct relief operations besides using domestic
helicopters, the foreign secretary said, according to the
Associated Press of Bangladesh. However, "at the moment, I don't
think we need any other external support to transport relief
goods," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Bangladesh is quite happy and encouraged by the response of
donors and international agencies," the foreign secretary said,
referring to the government's appeal for international assistance
for its over 22 million flood victims.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has got commitment of relief in cash and kind worth
about 85 million U.S. dollars from 22 countries and a number of
United Nations agencies and multinational bodies.
</P>
<P>
Nearly two-thirds of the country's territory has been affected
by the prolonged flood which started in early July, leaving
millions homeless and over 500 dead in 47 of the country's 64
districts.

<HEADLINE> World No.5 Liu Guoliang Completes Clean-sweep for China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JI'NAN, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Olympic champion Liu Guoliang
completed a clean-sweep of four titles for China after winning
the men's singles champion on the final day of the Chinese table
tennis Grand Prix here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Liu, ranked fifth in the world, fought back form one set down
to beat Ma Lin 19-21, 21-19, 21-13, 21-18 in a match of rallies
for the world's two top penholders.
</P>
<P>
The fourth set was a thriller as the rising star Ma, ranked
15th in the world, led at 18-15 before the more experienced Liu
scored six points in a row with powerful forehand smashes and
angled shots.
</P>
<P>
"Ma was a very hard-hitting player," said the second seed Liu.
"When I was trailing at the crucial moment, I felt very tough
pressure. But finally I became more concentrated and got the win."
</P>
<P>
The victory earned top prize money of 10,000 U.S. dollars for
Liu, who beat another yongh national teammate Yan Sen in the
semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
Ma, seventh seed in the tournament, stunned top seed and world
No.3 Kong Linghui in the semi-finals to set up the showdown with
the Olympic champion.
</P>
<P>
The women's doubles top honor was won by Chinese duo Yang
Ying/Wu Na, who held off fierce challenges from Park Hae Jung/Tyu
Ji Hae for a 21-19, 21-19 win in the final.
</P>
<P>
But the silver obtained by the South Korea pair was the lone
medal of any kind slipping off Chinese paddlers' hands.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese have bagged all the medals at stake on Saturday,
with Wu Na taking the women's singles title while Ma Lin/Qin
Zhijian grabbing the men's doubles trophy.
</P>
<P>
"The cleansweep shows that our players have made great
improvement after a long-time training during the winter,
especially for the men."said Cai Zhenhua, head coach of the
Chinese national team.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China failed to claim a men's singles champion in
the big international tournaments including the World
Championships and World Cup. This year, they have snatched the
men's singles titles at the Malaysian Open, Australian Open and
Chinese Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
"This is a good moment," Cai said. "But we should maintain it.
If so, I believe we can win at least four gold medals at the
Asian Games in Bangkok, Thailand, in December."

<HEADLINE> Hospital Looted in Mogadishu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A local maternity and child
heath care hospital in Karan district of North Mogadishu has been
ransacked by gunmen suspected to be among the watchmen of the
hospital late this week.
</P>
<P>
The hospital known as Marino Maternity has lost 16 beds from
its paediatric ward and eight from the gynecological department
together with all the stock of medicine the hospital had.
</P>
<P>
Mogadishu's Joint Health Authority (JHA) has expressed concern
over the ransacking, saying it caused setbacks to the few health
promotion centers in Somali capital Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the JHA said doctors are worried that the
practice might spread to other parts of the capital, like
Forlanini hospital, which accommodates the largest cholera
quarantine and the most sophisticated health laboratory donated
and equipped by the U.N. World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
He called on the people in Mogadishu to be aware of this new
wave of lootings, despite the efforts to improve security by
local Moslem militiamen under Sharia courts and volunteers from
the business community.
</P>
<P>
One of the health workers said the looters were the security
guards of the hospital who had also taken away the surgical
equipment and the main electric generator of the facility,
leaving the hospital dark and totally disabled.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to the staff of the facility funded
by the Italian Cooperation, the security staff themselves had
long been complaining about lack of payment for more than two
years.
</P>
<P>
"The security staff themselves had been becoming less in
number as the hope for payment had seemingly vanished," said one
of the local health workers.
</P>
<P>
Other sources disclosed that the security militiamen were
given some 470 U.S. Dollars for the equipment of the hospital
they stole and offered to another private health post which would
be opened in the same area.
</P>
<P>
However, there's no independent confirmation regarding this.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the newly-appointed administration of the capital
is trying hard to cope with the deteriorating sanitation and
security in the streets of Mogadishu.

BSkyB satellite television group is to buy English Premier League
soccer club Manchester United for up to 575 million pounds (about
958 million U.S. dollars), according to local reports on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Telegraph newspaper reported that the media tycoon
has agreed the cash deal with Martin Edwards, Manchester United's
chief executive and chairman, who is selling his 14 per cent
stake in the club for more than 80 million pounds.
</P>
<P>
The deal comes only weeks after United launched their own
television cable channel MUTV with the help of Murdoch's
television executives.
</P>
<P>
Manchester United, one of English soccer's most successful
clubs, was floated on the London stock market in 1991 for 47
million pounds and United commercial success has made the club's
value soar.
</P>
<P>
Shares in United were trading at 159p each at the close of
Stock Exchange on Friday night, showing little change on the week
and no sign of the extraordinary announcement.

<P>
LHASA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The central finance has
allocated a total of 700 million yuan to the Tibet Autonomous
Region for the first eight months, to help build its
infrastructures and realize an annual growth of ten percent.
</P>
<P>
The fund will go to projects in agriculture, urban
infrastructures, grain reserve system, and power grid building, in
a move to propel the economic growth in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Tibet has planned its fixed-asset investment at 3.07 billion
yuan early this year, which is thought appropriate to support its
annual growth goal. However, frequently occurred natural disasters
since last winter have severely damaged local infrastructures and
hampered the economic growth.

Officials with the regional government said special meetings
will soon be held to use the funds properly and approve more

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers on Sunday:
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- President Bill Clinton sought to calm American economic
jitters Saturday, saying the U.S. economy remains on the right
track despite the global financial turmoil that has pummeled U.S.
stocks.
</P>
<P>
-- The White House is bracing for a punishing report to
Congress from independent counsel Kenneth Starr that some of
President Clinton's advisors have now concluded will be more
sexually explicit, and possibly more politically damaging, as a
result of his grand jury testimony last month.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The economic policy leaders of the United States and Japan
met to discuss the heightened risk of global recession and a
further spread of the turmoil that has engulfed Asia, Russia and
now Latin America. But the meeting ended with no new plans, and an
uneasy sense that Japan and the United States remain on different
wavelengths about how quickly countries must act.
</P>
<P>
-- With partisan control of legislatures at risk in a
remarkable number of states, the once quaint business of
legislative politics has become intensely competitive,
sophisticated and costly.
</P>
<P>
-- As a black nationalist was concluding a youth rally in
Harlem with an expletive-laced diatribe against Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani and the police Saturday afternoon, police officers in
riot gear stormed the stage, prompting a series of scuffles and
tense standoffs to end what had been a peaceful event on an ugly
note of violence.

DHAKA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government will
set up environmental courts to try violators of laws on

the subsequent by-laws of 1997 will be punished, she said.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Environment has surveyed 7,000 out of 30,000
industries in the country, and found that 1,176 of them were
polluting the environment, the minister said.

<P>
The department has repeatedly urged these industries to set up
affluent treatment plants but with little response, she added.

<HEADLINE> Angola's Cement Output Rising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The yearly output of cement in
Angola will reach 500,000 tons worth 50 million U.S. Dollars by
2000, according to the general manager of Cimangola, the Cement
Plant of Angola.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's Jornal de Angola quoted General Manager of Cimangola
Forde Mauring as saying that the Angolan government has spent one
million U.S. Dollars in training its work force since early 1998
in a bid to keep up the momentum in the industry and achieve the
goal of producing half a million tons of cement in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Mauring noted that the goal can be met thanks to the hard-won
peace and the restoration of cement production in the war-ravaged
southern African country.
</P>
<P>
According to the general manager, in 1997 Angola's output of
cement was 301,000 tons, nearly doubling 1996's figure of 172,000
tons. The earnings of the cement industry last year was 35
million U.S. Dollars including a profit of three million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June this year, 215,000 tons of cement have
already been produced and the total output this year is expected
to exceed 350,000 tons, said Mauring.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that his plant spent nearly 20 million U.S.
Dollars at the first phase in repairing and maintaining the
outdated equipment and, at the second phase, it will invest 10
million Dollars in addressing the environmental problems caused
by cement production.
</P>
<P>
Cimangola has to improve its management and train more
technicians in response to meet the demands of the markets in
quantity and quality, he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, Mauring said that the funds needed in the second
phase starting 1999 have not been secured.
</P>
<P>
The main equipment of the cement plant had been products of
the 1960s and its designed cement capacity was five million tons
each year, with sand, clay and limestone as its raw materials.

<HEADLINE> China Exploring Potential of Marine Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government and
people have been paying more attention to the oceans since the
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea made stipulations
on exclusive economic zones which expanded China's marine areas
from 370,000-to-three million square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
"For China's coastal provinces and cities, the marine industry
is not only a promising sector awaiting to be exploited, but also
is of practical significance to the country's economy and
society," said a senior Chinese official.
</P>
<P>
Offshore aquaculture accounts for half of the total output
value of China's 300-billion-yuan marine industry. And annually
the ocean provides some 22 million tons of fish, shrimp, shellfish
and other marine life to China's consumer market.
</P>
<P>
With the implementation of "the strategy of developing marine
industry through science and technology," China's marine industry
is expected to develop by leaps and bounds in the near future, the
official predicted.
</P>
<P>
China has set up 10 model marine development centers, of which
eight are offshore aquaculture centers. And a series of biological
engineering techniques, intensive breeding skills and other
advanced techniques have been applied at those model bases to
improve productivity.
</P>
<P>
Experts here point out that, to date, China has exploited less
than one percent of its offshore and 20 percent of its beaches,
which means that the country's marine industry still has enormous
potential.

<HEADLINE> Shandong Holds Anti-Drug Exhibition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, September 6 (Xinhua) -- This capital of East China's
Shandong Province opened a 30-day exhibition today aimed at
steering young people away from drugs.
</P>
<P>
About 5,000 citizens frequented the exhibition this morning. On
display were more than 700 photographs and specimens of drugs, as
well as instruments for drug use and trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Shandong is considered to be one of the provinces with the
least number of drug users in China, thanks to the great efforts
the local government has put into the anti-drug campaign.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition is also part of the central government's
drug-control campaign, which attempts to check the use of drugs
through educating citizens and making them aware of the great harm
drugs can do to health.
</P>
<P>
Within the coming month the central government will also hold
seminars, publish magazines and open hotlines as part of the
efforts to check the spread of drug use.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The Pendama Project is showing
its most spectacular achievements in the biggest nature reserve in
southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region -- the Mount Qomolangma
Zone.
</P>
<P>
The pendama project (``pendama'' means countryside volunteer in
the Tibetan language) was launched three years ago by the regional
government with the help of the Future Generations Foundation of
the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The region's 224 "pendamas" were chosen to receive training by
this international aid program, then returned to the community to
offer services covering disease and environmental protection,
family planning and economic skills.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, the natural population growth rate in
this zone has decreased annually since 1994, the infant mortality
rate by 50 percent, and the immunity rate of the children has
reached more than 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
The volunteers have also organized villagers to build
irrigation works and plant trees. They have initiated plans to
develop ecological tourism and cash-crop forestry, so as to help
the local people to raise their living standards.
</P>
<P>
The "Pendama Project" is an outstanding model for
self-development not only in Tibet but for other underdeveloped
areas as well.

<HEADLINE> Descendents of Red Army Soliders Become Affluent (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Sixty-odd years ago poor
peasants in Caixi Township gathered alongside dirt roads passing
through the village and bade farewell their sons who were leaving
to join forces of Communist Party of China (CPC) Red Army in its
battle against the Kuomintang Regime.
</P>
<P>
Today, local villagers frequent gather along cemented roads to
bid farewell to local young people leaving home to earn their
fortunes in prosperous coastal cities.
</P>
<P>
Caixi, a major Red Army Base in east China's Fujian Province
during the 1930s, was the birthplace of at least 10 People's
Liberation Army generals. The Red Army made it a practice to
establish bases in poverty-stricken areas neglected by the
Kuomintang.
</P>
<P>
Some 80 percent of youngsters from Caixi joined the Red Army
during the war. Nonetheless, the township failed to escape poverty
for an extended period after the founding of the People's Republic
was founded in 1949.
</P>
<P>
Political movements dominated the lives of Chinese citizens
during the first three decades of New China and living standards
remained low.
</P>
<P>
The majority of local villagers continued to lead a hard life
laboring in the fields in the late 1970s. Their fate failed to
improve despite the fact that locals were widely recognized for
their skills at digging wells and construction.
</P>
<P>
In 1982, a young farmer named Wang Zhaoxian decided to try
something new and moved to Shenzhen in southern Guangdong
Province, the nation's first of the five special economic
zones. Wang proceeded to amass a small fortune from digging
wells.

<HEADLINE> 53 Percent of Indian Children Malnourished: UNICEF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 6 (Xinhua) -- As much as 53 percent of
Indian children were malnourished, a proportion much higher than
even the poorest countries of Sub-Saharan Africa, the United
Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) said in its latest report.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the figure is almost as high for the entire South
Asia, and half of the malnourished children in the world can be
found in just three countries -- Bangladesh, India and Pakistan,
it said.
</P>
<P>
The high rates of malnutrition in South Asia had been a major
cause for concern which called for immediate measures to contain
the malice, the UNICEF report said.
</P>
<P>
The problem was little investigated, research by nutritionists
was insufficient and there was no clear consensus on why the rate
of child malnutrition was so much higher in South Asia than
anywhere else in the world, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Indian officials admitted that compared to the nutritional
status in the rest of the developing world, even in South Asia,
India had not been doing as well as in other areas.
</P>
<P>
A number of theories have been put forth on this "Asian
enigma," but the most likely reason seemed to be the dietary
habits and the social conditions.
</P>
<P>
Asha Das, a secretary at the Department of Woman and Child
Development, told a workshop here last week that Women and
children remained the worst-hit victims of the ravages of
malnutrition in India.
</P>
<P>
She compared the attitude towards children in Africa and South
Asia as a reason for this phenomenon -- In Africa, a man provided
for his children first and next the woman while in India, the
social structure is the reverse, with a woman ensuring that the
man and children are fed first.
</P>
<P>
The exceptionally high rates of malnutrition in South Asia, the
UNICEF report said, were rooted deep in gender inequality.
</P>
<P>
"Women are subordinated in most regions of the world," the
report said. "But the subordination of South Asia's women is of a
different order, and the quality of child care suffers along with
the quality of women's own lives."
</P>
<P>
Malnutrition remained acute even 50 years after independence,
Das regretted, pointing to the paradox of food security being
attained at national level but remaining low at the household
level.
</P>
<P>
Even within a household, there is disparity of food
availability with children and women receiving less," she added,
attributing it to social as well as economic causes.

<P>
Other youngsters soon followed suit, with many villagers
eventually earning millions by contracting construction projects
in cities like Shenzhen. The prosperous Caixi natives have since
pumped much of their wealth into their hometown.
</P>
<P>
Local officials were initially perplexed about how to deal with
the new-found riches since their Red Army grandfathers had fought
tirelessly against the wealthy class.
</P>
<P>
Gradually, however, the officials gained an understanding that
reform required caring for both the poor and wealthy classes.
</P>
<P>
The philanthropic villagers have generously provided for their
hometown by sponsoring charity programs and investing heavily in
local industry and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The Caixi of today is prosperous town covering some four square
km, an area substantially larger than the former 0.3 square
kilometers. Villagers now enjoy electricity, modern roads and
telephone service.
</P>
<P>
Caixi's 1997 gross domestic product hit 540 million yuan, with
the per capita income of local farmers reaching 3,421 yuan, much
higher than the national average of 1,080 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the prosperous descendents of Red Army soldiers
have never lost sight of the heroic deed performed by their
forefathers some six decades ago.
</P>
<P>
A number of memorials have been built in the township in honor
of late Chinese leader Mao Zedong and the Red Army.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today said that the nation has won a decisive victory in
anti-flood work in the northern part of China.
</P>
<P>
He urged the whole nation to abide by the great spirit that the
people and the army exhibited during the campaign and to resume
production as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The president recently visited Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces
and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to supervise anti-flood
work.
</P>
<P>
Jiang praised the people and the army for their unified efforts
to overcome all difficulties.
</P>
<P>
"The nation should carry forth this spirit in helping the
people to resume production and rebuild their homes," said Jiang,
general secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party
of China.
</P>
<P>
Floods this summer have claimed more than 3,000 lives
nationwide, affecting some 223 million people in a total of 29
provinces and regions, and destroying five million houses.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that decisive victory was achieved after the people
and the army firmly implemented the correct decisions made by the
central government, and the success was a result of strict
vigilance and defending to the last.
</P>
<P>
Important cities, including Qiqihar, Harbin and Jiamusi, have
been protected, together with the Daqing Oilfield, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang urged the local people to consolidate their achievements
and solve their housing and heating problems before the arrival of
the winter.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in spring next year emphasis should be placed on the
prevention of diseases to ensure that no serious epidemics follow
the big disaster.

<HEADLINE> 5 Iranian Hostages Return to Tehran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Five Iranian hostages released
by the Afghan Taliban militia returned to Tehran via Islamabad,
Pakistan, on Sunday, Iran's official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Three of the five were taken hostage in August while two
others were captured last year by the Taliban and imprisoned in
Qandahar, southern Afghanistan, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Upon their arrival, the group of Iranians, set free by the
Taliban on Thursday as a "goodwill gesture," said that at least 45
more Iranian nationals are jailed in Qandahar.
</P>
<P>
But they said they did not know the whereabouts or the fate of
11 Iranian diplomats and an IRNA reporter allegedly kidnaped by
the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Iran accused the Taliban of abducting the Iranian diplomats,
the reporter and 35 truck drivers in August in Mazari Sharif of
northern Afghanistan and called on the Afghan group to release all
Iranians without any condition.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, however, has denied the captivity of Iranian
diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Reports have said the 11 Iranian diplomats were killed in
Mazari Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some 70,000 soldiers of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary
Guards Corps started on Thursday a maneuver in an area bordering
Afghanistan. It has been widely rumored that Iran is prepared to
launch a military attack on the Taliban if the Iranians are not
relased.

JERUSALEM September 6 (Xinhua) -- About 300,000 Israeli public
sector workers, including government employees, resumed strike
Sunday after a break during the weekend, with teachers' strike
entering the fifth day.
</P>
<P>
The strike renewed after Israel's national union Histadrut and
the Finance Ministry failed to resolve the disputes over
Histadrut's demand on pay increase for workers in their all-night
talks.
</P>
<P>
Government offices, railways, ports and local authority
services were closed down and the strike is set to expand to other
public sectors like hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Histadrut is demanding an 8 percent wage rise for the public
sector workers, but the Finance Ministry has refused to give
salary increases of more than 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The talks on payment rise for teachers between representatives
of the Education Ministry, the teachers' unions and the Finance
Ministry also broke down in the early morning, keeping students

SOFIA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria has so far sold all 400
kilograms of rose oil it produced in this season, according to
news reports here today.
</P>
<P>
The 400 kilograms of rose oil, a traditional export product of
the country, was extracted from more than 1,000 tons of rose
petals the country harvested this year.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the oil has all been purchased by U.S. and French
companies at the prices of 3,650-4,000 U.S. dollars per kilogram,
the highest in the world market.
</P>

A Bulgarian rose oil expert attributed the oil's popularity to
the unique natural conditions in Bulgaria, the pure strains of the
roses and special processing techniques.

<HEADLINE> Gross Ends Reign at Spurs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Christian Gross's reign at
English premier league club Tottenham Hotspur came to an end on
Saturday after poor start of the club to the season.
</P>
<P>
Gross, formerly of Grasshoppers of Zurich, joined Tottenham
last November but had been under increasing pressure after Spurs
had just one victory in their first three games.
</P>
<P>
Director of football David Pleat has taken temporary charge -
but the club has refused to say whether Gross has been sacked.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the club stated: "The board of Tottenham
Hotspur regretfully announce the departure of head coach
Christian Gross with immediate effect.
</P>
<P>
"For the present, our director of football David Pleat, will
take temporary charge together with Chris Hughton and the exist
ing coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
"This will enable the club to take a sensible time in making
the next very important appointment of our new head coach."
</P>
<P>
Chairman Alan Sugar was asked whether Gross had jumped or been
pushed, but he simply said: "We have got nothing more to say than
what is in the press release."
</P>
<P>
The Swiss coach, who led the side to Premiership safety last
season after taking over from Gerry Francis in November 1997, was
the bookmakers' favourite to be the first top-flight manager to
lose his job in the 1998-99 campaign.
</P>
<P>
But Kenny Dalglish's sacking from Newcastle last month
prevented him from suffering that ignominy.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian King Threatens to Abdicate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SIEM REAP, Cambodia, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian King
Norodom Sihanouk said Sunday that he will ask to abdicate if he
could not resolve the current political crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
The 75-year-old monarch made the statement at a working meeting
he hosted in his Siem Reap residence.
</P>
<P>
Sihanouk offered to mediate among his ousted son, Prince
Norodom Ranariddh, Second Prime Minister Hun Sen and former
finance minister Sam Rainsy, wishing to solve the current
political crisis and form a new government.
</P>
<P>
However, the king expressed no confidence at the meeting, which
none of the three people attended as he had expected.
</P>
<P>
"I do not have much hope that the three-day meeting will have
the positive result that I wish," the king wrote in a message
Friday. "The parties have deep conflicts with each other and have
not yet agreed to make any concessions or compromises."
</P>
<P>
He even said that he would appeal to U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan to mediate the election dispute.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which started last Saturday, has achieved no
progress so far. Representatives of three main political parties
of the Funcinpec party, the Cambodian People's Party (CPP) and the
Sam Rainsy Party (SRP) still adhered to their own respective
stance.
</P>
<P>
The CPP demanded the other two parties participate in the
National Assembly (parliament) meeting before their issues related
to the election were resolved.
</P>
<P>
But Funcinpec and the SRP reaffirmed that their demands for a
recount of votes, ballot reconciliation and the use of an earlier
seat formula in more favor of them should be met before they could
join the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The CPP won the majority of the Assembly seats in the July 26
election, but failed to get two-thirds of votes necessary for it
to form a new government independently. It needs the cooperation
of Funcinpec and the SRP, but the two opposition parties rejected
the released official results of the election.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrations and sits-in supporting the two opposition
parties are still going on in front of the Assembly
building. About 30,000 students and supporters of the opposition
parties participated in Sunday's demonstration, rejecting the
election results and demanding resignation of Second Prime
Minister Hun Sen.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Water Pollution Embarrasses Indian Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Ground water in most parts
of the Indian capital is highly contaminated with fluoride,
nitrate and a number of heavy metals and is not fit for drinking
without treatment, warns a survey just published here.
</P>
<P>
Even worse, availability of potable water was limited due to
salinity and bacteriological contamination, said the survey
jointly conducted in February and March this year by Central
Ground Water Board (CGWB) and Central Pollution Central Board
(CPCB).
</P>
<P>
After an analysis of 303 ground water samples collected from
different structures, depths and locations in Delhi area, the
survey found that in over 30 percent of the capital area, fluoride
contents in ground water surpassed the permissible limit (1.5
mg/l), particularly in the southwestern and western parts of the
city.
</P>
<P>
Nitrate pollution in the ground water was also significant
particularly in the southwest part, which might be due to improper
disposal of sewage and unhygienic conditions prevailing around the
well, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the survey found, underground water was also
contaminated to the "alarming" stage due to unplanned disposal of
effluents, sewage and sewerage in the city.
</P>
<P>
Compounding the serious water pollution, the underground water
level in the populous city is going down at an average of 0.4
meters every year.
</P>
<P>
According to a study conducted by hydrologists at the Nuclear
Research Laboratory of the Indian Agricultural Institute published
in May, in the southern part of the city, the underground water
level had plummeted from 15 meters below the ground in 1979 to 20
meters in 1984 and 29 meters in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In the northern part, the study found, the underground water
level had fallen appreciably from three meters in 1984 to 10
meters in 1989 and 25 meters in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In a city with a population of some 10 million, experts said,
the increasing shortage and contamination of water sources are
truly alarming.
</P>
<P>
A study conducted by All India Institute of Medical Sciences
revealed in July that 64 percent of Delhi school children had a
high level of lead in their blood stream, above the safe
permissible limits.
</P>
<P>
Dr. P. S. Dutta of the Nuclear Research Laboratory said there
was a wide gap between the demand for and availability of water,
both in terms of quantity and quality.
</P>
<P>
Water has already become precious in many parts of the Indian
capital and, some say, it will become one of the rarest
commodities in a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
Daily water supply now in Delhi is about 600 million gallons
against the demand of 800 million gallons, leaving a shortfall of
25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Dutta maintained that water pollution and depletion issues were
inextricably tied to many other factors, such as the size of the
city area, population density, land use pattern changes, the
provisional basic social services and the degrees of economic
development.
</P>
<P>
the Central Ground Water Authority proposed in June to restrict
exploitation of ground water in Delhi in view of the receding
water level, a move which will definitely effect industrial and
agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
The problem is found not only in New Delhi, 16 states of the
country have already been designated as fluorosis-endemic regions,
affecting some 16 million rural Indians including six million
children.
</P>
<P>
Like many cities in the world, water shortage and pollution
are now an imperative and imminent task facing the Indian
government and authorities concerned in particular.

ANKARA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz said here on Sunday that it is important to remove the
deadlock of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure for a three-day visit to Jordan, Israel
and the Palestinian self-rule areas, Yilmaz said the peace process
has been stalled for a long time and dragged to a very dangerous
course.
</P>
<P>
During his visits, the Turkish prime minister will discuss
bilateral relations, regional and international issues with
Jordanian, Israeli and Palestinian leaders, local sources said.
</P>
<P>
In Amman, Yilmaz will meet with Crown Prince Hassan, deputizing
for King Hussein who is in the United States for cancer treatment,
and Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh on the developments of the
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
After wrapping up his trip in Jordan, Yilmaz will travel to
Israel and the Palestinian self-rule areas to hold talks with
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Turkey will sign with Israel a cooperation agreement in the
field of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Jordan maintain close ties with Turkey while the PNA
is critical of the rapid expansion of the Turkish-Israeli military
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Israel struck several deals in 1996 on military and
defense cooperation, a move strongly criticized by the Arab
world.

<HEADLINE> Yilmaz to Be in Amman for Military, Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz will be here later Sunday to enhance military and economic
cooperation with Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Jordan Times Sunday quoted an unidentified
expert on Turkish-Jordanian ties as saying that both sides will
discuss a joint ground military maneuver scheduled for next
spring in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
During Yilmaz's two-day official visit, his discussion with
the Jordanian side is still expected to cover Turkish desires to
establish joint military industries with Jordan and provide Jordan
with military spare parts, especially for the F-16 planes that the
United States gave to Jordan as military aid, Turkish Ambassador
to Jordan Suha Umar told the paper.
</P>
<P>
Both side will also discuss a plan to train a joint air force
squadron in each other's airspace, said Umar, who was a former
senior officer in Turkey's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Umar said that other countries in the region have no
reason for "concern" over the current and upcoming military
cooperation between Turkey and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
"The cooperation is not against anyone in the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Umar also denied that Turkey, Israel and Jordan are trying to
build a military alliance.
</P>
<P>
Except for military talks, Umar said, Yilmaz and his
100-member-strong delegation will also discuss with the Jordanian
side economic issues such as supply of drinking water to the
kingdom, extension of Turkish experience to Jordan in the fields
of irrigation and agriculture as well as establishment of joint
ventures, especially irrigation projects and dams and roads
construction projects.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Minister of Information Nasir Judeh here on Saturday
played a different tune from Umar, saying that Yilmaz and his
delegation will focus on economic talks, rather than on military
topics, with the Jordanian side.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz is scheduled to meet Crown Prince Hassan, the Regent,
and his Jordanian counterpart Fayez Tarawneh, while members of the
accompanying will meet Jordanian businessmen on investment and
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz will visit the Palestinian self-rule areas and Israel
after he concludes his visit here.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Revises Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The first session of the
10th Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) Saturday amended and supplemented the constitution
and elected a new state leadership.
</P>
<P>
The full text of the revised constitution was released Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The newly-added preface to the constitution points out that the
socialist constitution of the DPRK is "a Kim Il-sung Constitution
which legalizes the major thoughts and achievements of the Great
Leader in the country's construction."
</P>
<P>
Comrade Kim Il-sung is "the founder of the DPRK and the first
ancestor of the socialist Korea," says the preface.
</P>
<P>
He "put forward the most superior social system, political
patterns and social governing system and management methods,
revealed the fundamental principles and ways for the unification
of the motherland and expounded the basic objectives of Korea's
foreign policy."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the country upholds Comrade Kim Il-sung as its
"eternal president," the preface says.
</P>
<P>
Amendments to the constitution concerning the state leadership
bodies stipulate that the chairman of the National Defense
Commission (NDC) commands all armed forces, directs the overall
defense work and is empowered to set up and abolish the central
organs of national defense departments.
</P>
<P>
The revised constitution has also annulled the Central People's
Committee of Korea and the Standing Committee of the Supreme
People's Assembly, and integrated them into the Presidium of the
Supreme People's Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The presidium, says the constitution, is the highest organ of
state power for the duration of the Supreme People's Assembly and
is composed of a chairman, vice chairmen, a secretary general and
its members.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the presidium is in charge of organizing and
directing the presidium work and accepting credentials from envoys
of other countries on behalf of the state.
</P>
<P>
The revised constitution has also canceled the Administration
Council and set up a new cabinet, which is the supreme
administrative executive body in charge of the management of the
whole country.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet is composed of a premier, vice premiers, ministers
and other members.
</P>
<P>
The premier takes charge of the cabinet work and represents the
Korean government.
</P>
<P>
The socialist constitution of Korea was endorsed on December
27, 1972 at the first session of the 5th Supreme People's Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The latest amendment was made on the basis of the constitution
revised at the third session of the 9th Supreme People's Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The organs of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly
and cabinet existed until the adoption of the 1972
Constitution. Chui Yong-gon served as chairman of the presidium
and Kim Il-sung as cabinet premier.
</P>
<P>
The three-day session which opened Saturday elected Kim Jong Il
the chairman of the National Defense Commission (NDC) and Hong
Song Nam premier on the same day.

<HEADLINE> Libya rejects U.S., British Lockerbie Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tunis, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi
has rejected a proposal made by the United States and Britain that
two Libyans suspected of blowing up a Pan Am flight be tried in
the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a gathering in Tripoli late Saturday, Gaddafi said
that this is not the trial in a third country that Libya has
demanded but a deal "to make the third country a transit point to
transfer the accused to Britain."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain called for the trial of the two Libyans in
the Netherlands. If found guilty, they would be transferred to
Britain to serve their time.
</P>
<P>
The 1988 bombing of the Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland,
killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
"We (are ready) to go tomorrow to the Netherlands, provided
that the Netherlands is the last stop in case of acquittal or
conviction. Guarantees to that effect are necessary," Gaddafi said.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony marked the 29th anniversary of the Revolution Day
that brought Gaddafi to power in 1969. Five African presidents -
Sudan's Omar el-Bashir, Chad's Idriss Deby, Niger's Ibrahim Bare
Mainassara, Mali's Alpha Oumar Konare and the Central African
Republic's Ange-Felix Patasse - flew to the Libyan capital to
attend the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi praised the African leaders for flying to Tripoli in
defiance of the U.N. air ban, saying that "they stepped on
the American sanctions with their dark feet."
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council imposed arms and travel
embargo on Libya, banning arms sales and air flight to and from
the country due to Libya's refusal to hand over the two suspects
to the U.S. and Britain as they demanded.
</P>
<P>
The Council passed recently another resolution calling for
lifting the trade sanctions on Libya once the suspects are
transferred to the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Washington and London, which have long insisted
that any trial be on their territories, said they would accept a
trial in the Netherlands with Scottish judges and under Scottish
law.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi said earlier that he wanted further negotiations to
provide "guarantees" for the suspects' safe custody and fair
trial. Washington and London say the offer is non-negotiable.

<HEADLINE> Swazi King Vows to Stick to Traditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 6 (Xinhua) -- King Mswati III of
Swaziland has vowed to stick to the country's traditions which he
believes ensured Swaziland's peace and unity and helped secure
"unique democracy" in the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during Saturday's celebrations of the 30th
anniversary of the country's independence and his 30th birthday,
Mswati III also called on other African leaders to revive their
traditions because they "bring peace and tranquillity."
</P>
<P>
Economic difficulties, rather than political transformation,
is the greatest challenge facing the kingdom of Swaziland, the
king said at the function in capital Mbabane.
</P>
<P>
The country's strongest ally against these challenges was its
adherence to Swazi traditions and culture established by the
ancestors, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is imperative that we maintain our traditions. It is
important for our communities and our country. Our people should
know where they come from," Mswati III said.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland, a tiny mountainous kingdom sandwiched between South
Africa and Mozambique, is the only country in Southern Africa
where political parties are outlawed.
</P>
<P>
The king, together with his Queen Mother, advisers and the
cabinet, implements decisions that are supposedly taken by the
Swazi people.
</P>
<P>
With the country's October general elections drawing near,
pressure has been mounting for the monarch on to unban political
parties to introduce constitutional reform.
</P>
<P>
Mswati III Saturday defended the monarch rule, saying that it
safeguards the country's democracy.
</P>
<P>
"Our democracy in Swaziland is unique. We do not have a
multi-party system but everyone is represented in governance," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that we do not have a multi-party system does not
mean that we are not democratic. The Swazi people have totally
rejected a multi-party system and we cannot simply introduce it
just because some countries have it," the king said.
</P>
<P>
Mswati III said traditions formed part of the cultural
identity of the Swazi people and would also be used to promote
tourism and inject much-needed cash into the kingdom's economy.
</P>
<P>
Several heads of state attended the celebrations, including
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba and Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano.
</P>
<P>
Botswanan President Festus Mogae, Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa and Namibian President Sam Nujoma were also present.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela and Lesotho's King
Letsie III are expected to arrive in Mbabane Sunday morning to
attend Sunday's independence celebrations.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Launch New Mobile Phone Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 6 (Xinhua) -- An international consortium will
launch a new mobile telephone service in Egypt in November, the
Egyptian Gazette reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The English daily quoted Misrfone Chief Executive Officer John
Logan as saying on Saturday its mobile telephone service, Click
GSM, would be launched on November 30 in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Egypt signed a licensing deal in May with the Misrfone
Telecommunications Co., composed of Britain's Vodafone Group Plc,
MSI Electronics, U.S. AirTouch Communications Inc. and France's CG
Sat of Compagnie Generale Des Eaux.
</P>
<P>
Misrfone has planned to expand coverage by the end of the year
to the country's tourist resorts of Alexandria, Sharm el-Sheikh,
Hurghada, and Luxor in early 1999. It will continue to build up
the network to cover over 84 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
Egypt signed the first licensing agreement last April with
MobiNil, a consortium that includes France Telecom, the American
Motorola, and Egyptian partners Orascom, Al-Ahram, and Alcatel and
Motorola agents.
</P>
<P>
MobiNil President Osman Sultan said last month its network
would be expanded to more than 300,000 subscribers by the end of
the year from 160,000 by the end of August.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Pete Sampras of the
United States and the rest of the world's big names all sailed
into the fourth round with easy victories at the U.S. Open tennis
championships here today.
</P>
<P>
Sampras needed just 78 minutes to beat Mikael Tillstrom of
Sweden 6-2, 6-3, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Patrick Rafter of Australia demolished
qualifier David Nainkin of South Africa 6-1, 6-1, 6-1 in just 66
minutes.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, serving 14 aces at up to 125 mph, won 91 percent of
his first-serve points. "It was a little up and down from both of
us. I really had no rhythm on my serves, got a little careless at
times," Sampras said.
</P>
<P>
His next opponent will be unseeded Marat Safin, who beat
Thomas Muster in the third round.
</P>
<P>
Rafter, who is seeded third here, used his aggressive
serve-and-volley attack to dominate the match. Rafter won 44 of
52 points at the net and Nainkin contributed to his won demise
with 23 unforced errors to go along with only eight winners.
Rafter had 28 winners and only seven unforced errors.
</P>
<P>
Rafter will meet 14th seed Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia, who
beat veteran Paul Haahuis of the Netherlands 7-6, 6-3, 6-4.
Ivanisevic fought off a set point in the opening set and won it
in a tiebreak 7-5 and dominated play from that point. Ivanisevic
had 21 aces,including one at 132 miles per hour, and took
advantage of 44 unforced errors by Haahuis.
</P>
<P>
Eighth seed Andre Agassi of the United States also had a
relatively easy day, beating Davide Sanguinetti of Italy 6-2,
6-3, 6-0 in only one hour 36 minutes. Sanguinetti made 44
unforced errors.
</P>
<P>
The only men's seed to lose today was No. 6 Greg Rusedski, who
was upset 4-6, 6-4, 5-7, 6-2, 6-4 by Jan Siemerink in a match
lasted 3 hours 22 minutes.
</P>
<P>
In other third round action today, ninth seed Karol Kucera of
Slovakia beat Adrian Voinea of Romania 7-5, 6-3, 6-2; 12th seed
Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden stormed past Fabrice Santoro of France
6-3, 6-1, 6-2; and 18-year-old Marat Safin of Russia ousted
Thomas Muster of Austria 6-4, 6-4, 1-6, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
In women's third round competition, second seed Lindsay
Davenport of the United States routed Virginia Ruano-Pascual of
Spain 6-2, 6-1. No. 4 Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain blitzed
Sarah Pitkowski of France 6-2, 6-3; and fifth seed Venus Williams
of the United States advanced when Larisa Neiland of Latvia
retired with a leg injury trailing 5-0 in the opening set.
Williams, who lost to Martina Hingis in last year's final, won
five games in just 13 minutes and Neiland managed only six points
overall.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Middlesbrough Rejects Reports on Merson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 5 (Xinhua) -- English premier league club
Middlesbrough manager Bryan Robson has rejected reports that Paul
Merson is attempting to leave the club.
</P>
<P>
The manager criticised claims made in The Sun newspaper that
recovering alcoholic Merson had decided to leave the club because
of Paul Gascoigne's drinking habits.
</P>
<P>
"If you buy comics, you get a comic book story," Robson said.
</P>
<P>
"I do not see why I should have to talk about this, it is
absolute rubbish and I can't condemn the journalist strongly
enough.
</P>
<P>
"I have spoken with Paul Merson a number of times recently and
he has stressed how happy he is at Middlesbrough. This is total
rubbish and I am very annoyed."
</P>
<P>
The newspaper claimed that Merson had already signed a
contract with an un-named Premiership side.
</P>
<P>
Merson, who is currently preparing for England's Euro 2000
qualifier against Sweden on Saturday, recently signed a new
five-year contract with the Teesside club.

<HEADLINE> Gross Ends Reign at Spurs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Christian Gross's reign at
English premier league club Tottenham Hotspur came to an end on
Saturday after poor start of the club to the season.
</P>
<P>
Gross, formerly of Grasshoppers of Zurich, joined Tottenham
last November but had been under increasing pressure after Spurs
had just one victory in their first three games.
</P>
<P>
Director of football David Pleat has taken temporary charge -
but the club has refused to say whether Gross has been sacked.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the club stated: "The board of Tottenham
Hotspur regretfully announce the departure of head coach
Christian Gross with immediate effect.
</P>
<P>
"For the present, our director of football David Pleat, will
take temporary charge together with Chris Hughton and the exist
ing coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
"This will enable the club to take a sensible time in making
the next very important appointment of our new head coach."
</P>
<P>
Chairman Alan Sugar was asked whether Gross had jumped or been
pushed, but he simply said: "We have got nothing more to say than
what is in the press release."
</P>
<P>
The Swiss coach, who led the side to Premiership safety last
season after taking over from Gerry Francis in November 1997, was
the bookmakers' favorite to be the first top-flight manager to
lose his job in the 1998-99 campaign.
</P>
<P>
But Kenny Dalglish's sacking from Newcastle last month
prevented him from suffering that ignominy.

<HEADLINE> Top Three Split 1 Million Dollars, No Record Broken </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Muscovites took a break from
their dreadful markets Saturday to watch the track and field's
biggest payday in the Luzhniki Stadium, where three top athletes
divided a 1 million U.S. dollar jackpot.
</P>
<P>
American Marion Jones walked away with over 600,000 dollars
after finishing 10.83 seconds to win the women's 100 meters at
the Grand Prix Finals of the International Amateur Athletics
Federation.
</P>
<P>
The victory gave Jones one-third of the 1 million dollar
Golden League jackpot, in addition to 200,000 dollars for the
women's overall Grand Prix title and 50,000 dollars for the race
win.
</P>
<P>
Jones, who only committed to sprint last year, also took the
long jump title, finishing at 7.13 meters, adding another 50,000
dollars to her wallet.
</P>
<P>
The other two athletes who shared the 1 million dollar
jackpot, for athletes who win their events at all six Golden
League meets as well as the Moscow Finals, were Hicham El
Guerrouj of Morocco and Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
"The main thing for me was victory. There were no rivals for
me," said El Guerrouj, who ran the final lap of the 1,500 meters
alone and finished the race at 3:32.03.
</P>
<P>
Gebrselassie took the 3,000 meters event in 7:50.00. His only
likely challenger, Luke Kipkosgei of Kenya, was second in 7:50.87.
</P>
<P>
In sharp contrast to the richer winners, the Russians are
seeing their rubles' value plunging day by day as the country
goes without a fully functioning government and residents flock
to shops to hoard what commodities they can as a hedge against
ever climbing prices and inflation.
</P>
<P>
The national currency dropped to 16.99 rubles to the dollar, a
fall of some 130 percent as compared to pre-crisis levels.
</P>
<P>
It was the financial crisis, and security concerns, that
prompted some 50 athletes to file a petition last week urging the
IAAF to switch venues.
</P>
<P>
The security in and around the stadium, however, turned out to
be well-organized, although the presence of security personnel
appeared to be far lighter than during the World Youth Games in
July.
</P>
<P>
Despite the high-profile promotions and big prize money, no
records were broken in the meet, unfolded in the newly
refurbished Luzhniki Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
Observers said athletes were tired after the long season,
which carried contestants to Oslo, Rome, Montecarlo, Zurich,
Brussels and Berlin in the IAAF Golden League meetings.
</P>
<P>
The only other athletes who could grab a slice of the 1
million dollars jackpot was Bryan Bronson, also of the United
States, but he finished a disappointing sixth in men's 400 meter
hurdles,which was won by Stephane Diagana of France.
</P>
<P>
Other winners of the day included Natalya Sadova of Russia in
women's discus with 68.50 meters; Tibor Gecsek of Hungary in the
men's hammer throw at 81.21 meters; Frankie Fredericks of Namibia
in men's 100 meters in 10.10 and Briton Mark Richardson who took
the men's 400 in 44.88.
</P>
<P>
Gete Wami of Ethiopia won the women's 3,000 meters in
8:40.11.The title for women's 100 meters hurdles went to Michelle
Freeman of Jamaica who finished at 12.56.
</P>
<P>
Falilat Ogunkoya of Nigeria won the women's 400 meters in
49.73.
</P>
<P>
Big athletics names that were absent from the Moscow scene
included world and Olympic champion Michael Johnson, Maurice
Green and Ato Boldon, who withdrew for what the IAAF described as
personal reasons.
</P>
<P>
The weather Saturday, though cool and overcast, had been
generally cooperating. Indeed it was far better than during the
Youth Games, when Mayor Yuri Luzhkov had to mobilize special
aircraft to drive away rain-laden clouds to Moscow's suburbs.

<HEADLINE> IMF Chides Philippines for Low Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 6 (Xinhua) -- An International Monetary Fund
(IMF) panel reviewing the Philippine economy here has scolded the
Department of Finance for not allowing interest rates to move up.
</P>
<P>
Sources involved in the talks said Sunday the IMF criticized
the department for its continued refusal to allow the interest
rates to go up during the weekly government securities auction.
</P>
<P>
The IMF, said the sources who refused to be identified,
expressed the view that low interest rates "put too much
pressures" on the peso which has devaluated about one third of its
value against the U.S. dollar since July last year.
</P>
<P>
However, Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu reportedly assured
the IMF that its decision to keep the interest rates down is made
in consultation with central bank governor Gabriel Singson.
</P>
<P>
The IMF, as a policy, always supports hiking the interest rates
to protect the local currency. In a previous paper, the IMF
already recommended that the Philippine monetary authorities bring
up the rates to fight off speculative attacks against the peso.
</P>
<P>
The government, however, has been resisting a rise in the rates
because of its adverse effect on economic growth.
</P>
<P>
During the review, the IMF has allowed the Philippine
government to have a 40-billion-peso (930 million U.S. dollars)
budget deficit this year, but requested Manila to reduce its gross
national product (GNP) growth rate to 1.5 percent from 2-3 percent
this year.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the IMF panel and the Philippines'
economic managers are set to meet Monday to finally agree on the
growth target.

<HEADLINE> Hangzhou to Build Huge Sewage Treatment Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The largest sewage treatment
project in this capital of east China's Zhejiang province in
nearly five decades is expected to be operational in October next
year.
</P>
<P>
The project involves a total investment of 370 million yuan,
including 23 million German marks granted by the German
government, according to Yang Xubiao, director of the municipal
urban construction commission.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to play a very important role in easing
and eventually eliminating pollution in the city's inner part and
the 40-kilometer section of the Grand Canal that runs through
Hangzhou, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
The amount of sewage discharged in Hangzhou has surged since
the 1990s. Because the discharge system in the northern part of
the city is inadequate, some 410,000 tons of untreated water is
discharged into the Grand Canal every day. The canal, dug more
than 1,300 years ago, is the earliest and longest manmade river in
the world.
</P>
<P>
Hangzhou is one of China's most popular tourist destinations
and well-known for West Lake, Qiantang River and the Grand Canal.

<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Three years ago, people of
Tongxin County in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region found it
difficult to travel. They had to ride a bus four-to-five days
before they could catch a train.
</P>
<P>
At present, the county which has the largest proportion of Hui
ethnic group (the Chinese muslim) in the country is connected with
the rest of the world not only by modern rail lines but also air
routes.
</P>
<P>
Because of the completion of Hedong Airport in Yinchuan, the
Baoji-Zhongwei Railway and an optical fiber telecommunication
trunk line -- all key state projects -- people of the inland
region now can fly to major Chinese cities in just a few hours and
do business with more than 190 countries and regions via telephone
and computer.
</P>
<P>
In mountainous southern Ningxia, people of some of the most
underdeveloped areas of the country are also benefiting from the
state-supported projects.
</P>
<P>
For example, because of the completion of the largest
drinking-water project in Asia, 360,000 rural people in the
"Xihaigu" area, together with more in neighboring Shaanxi and
Gansu provinces, no longer have to drink bitter alkaline water.
</P>
<P>
The central government has also invested three billion yuan
(361 million U.S. dollars) in reclaiming 130,000 hectares of
wasteland and is helping relocate one million people.
</P>
<P>
The central government each year allocates 30 million yuan to
help with the poverty-relief program in the area, which expects to
rid the area of poverty next year.

<HEADLINE> Farmer in Northwest China Breeds 500 Strains of Peony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A farmer in northwest China's
Gansu Province has bred more than 500 strains of the peony flower
and turned a barren hill in his hometown into a peony garden.
</P>
<P>
Peony, regarded as "the king of flowers" in China, is an
integral part of Chinese tradition and often chanted by poets in
ancient times.
</P>
<P>
All of the varieties of peony, bred and cultivated by Chen
Dezhong in Yuzhong County in the suburbs of Lanzhou, carry purple
spots on their petals, a characteristic different from those in
central China.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who has cultivated peonies for more than three decades,
said his hometown has a long history of peony cultivation and his
grandfather and father were all engaged in the business. "My basic
techniques were learned from my father," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen has traveled deep into the mountains in the Tibet
Autonomous Region, Yunnan and Sichuan provinces in southwest China
to look for wild peonies. Then he took back the wild peonies and
bred them with local species, as well as those brought back from
other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Chen's peonies have attracted experts at home and abroad, and
his peonies with purple spots are classified as top-grade strains.
</P>
<P>
Chen's breeding technologies have been introduced into Japan,
the United States and Europe, and earned him large amounts of
income.
</P>
<P>
Peony cultivation has become a backbone industry in Chen's
hometown, and the local government plans to cultivate 2,000 mu
(about 133 hectares) of peony gardens.

<HEADLINE> Thailand To Reduce VAT On Vital Food, Milk Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Abhist said the reduction of VAT on certain products is
necessary as Thailand's economy has slowed down considerably, and
the rate of unemployment is expected to increase to more than
three million people, thus affecting people's living standards.
</P>
<P>
The adjustment of VAT on necessary food and milk products is
expected to stimulate purchasing power in the country. However,
the government does not plan to reduce personal income tax or
corporate tax.
</P>
<P>
Abhist said the 1998-2000 fiscal deficit policy was still
necessary and he personally believed there was no need to reduce
personal income tax and corporate tax as proposed by some because
it might affect the government's income.
</P>
<P>
The government is looking into how much income has been
accumulated since it increased VAT from seven percent to 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
Abhist said he supported reducing VAT on food and milk as was
being done by some countries.
</P>
<P>
The government is also pushing for abolition of property tax
and local tax and will instead collect land tax and building tax,
which will be in accordance with the value of the items. The tax
collection will come under local authorities and will also levy
penalty for land that is not being used.

<HEADLINE> Rio Group Hopes World Financial Institutions to Curb Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The leaders of the Rio
Group called on the world financial institutions Saturday to help
prevent the increasing financial crises from threatening the Latin
American countries.
</P>
<P>
At the 12th summit of the group, leaders said the Latin
American economy has been in the stage of steady growth, but the
countries in the region must work out measures to avoid financial
crises.
</P>
<P>
They urged the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and
the Inter-American Development Bank to take measures to deal with
the crises before they break out.
</P>
<P>
The Panama Declaration issued Saturday said that the Group of
Rio will continue to develop its relations with the European
Union, saying that cooperation between the two organizations can
play an important role in promoting world political balance and
maintaining peace.
</P>
<P>
The 12 presidents from the Rio Group also agreed to revitalize
the group's political coordination and develop ties with the
Central American and Caribbean countries.
</P>
<P>
The group, established in 1986, is made up of Argentina,
Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia, Panama,
Mexico, Colombia and Venezuela.

Representatives from El Salvador and Guyana attended the
summit. The two nations have expressed their desire to join the

against their demand.
</P>
<P>
Colombian President Andres Pastrana said that Colombia, Mexico
and Venezuela will support the two to be new members of the group
because this would inject a new life into this regional
organization.
</P>
<P>
The two-day summit ended Saturday and the 13th summit will be
held in Mexico in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment to Return in Mid-1999: Thai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Thai Deputy Prime Minister
Supachai Panitchpakdi said he is optimistic that foreign
investment will start to return to Thailand in the second half of
1999, local television station Channel 9 reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said that at present, the United States is flooded with
capital, much of which has been diverted to Europe.
</P>
<P>
But with problems gradually emerging in Eastern Europe,
particularly Russia, he believed that excess capital will return
to the Asian region, especially Thailand where conditions are
attractive for foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the government had already taken several
steps to attract foreign investment, including liberalization of
foreign land ownership and foreign business and occupation
restrictions, structural reform of financial institutions, and
more favorable incentives for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
A separate report by the Bangkok Post newspaper Sunday quoted
the Bank of Thailand as saying that net foreign investment for the
first five months of this year amounted to 104 billion baht (2.6
billion U.S. dollars) compared to 117 billion baht (2.9 billion
dollars) for the whole year of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the foreign investment could not be seen as a
boost for manufacturers as most of the funds were meant for
capital increase and swaps of debt for equity by financial
institutions, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Oil Price Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The average price of the
Venezuelan basket of crudes and byproducts rose by 25 U.S. cents
per barrel to 10.21 dollars this weekend from 9.96 dollars a week
earlier.
</P>
<P>
The basket averaged 11.07 dollars per barrel during the first
eight months of the year, while the average in August was 10.17
dollars, according to the Energy and Mines Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The price set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) dropped by two cents to 11.98 dollars this
weekend from 12 dollars a week before.
</P>
<P>
Oil sources forecast that the world crude oil prices will
gradually rise during the remaining part of this year because the
total output will fall by more than 2 million barrels a day under
an agreement between independent producers and OPEC.
</P>
<P>
They said that although a market glut that can sustain 90-day
consumption has pressed the prices downward, the fall in Russian
oil exports has caused advances in oil price quotations in the
past few days.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Produce High Yield Jute Strain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The Central Agriculture
Research Institute (CARI) of the State Agricultural Services of
Myanmar is conducting experiments on producing high yield and high
quality jute in the country.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, production of quality strain, selection of
growing time and new cultivation method are being carried out,
official The New Light of Myanmar newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to the new findings of the CARI, by applying
line-planting method, the per hectare yield will be 1.4 tons with
a maximum output as much as 3.2 tons.
</P>
<P>
In the past, jute growers in Myanmar applied broadcast sowing
method, producing one ton per hectare the most.
</P>
<P>
The CARI has worked out a formula for increased jute yield by
applying fertilizer such as urea, potash and T-super
proportionately.
</P>
<P>
The best time for growing jute with increased output is found
as being in February and March.
</P>
<P>
Experiments are also being made for growing yellow jute, which
is on demand in the foreign market, by producing the required
strain with the help of radiotherapy in southern part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Jute is one of Myanmar's agricultural crops. The four major
crops are paddy, beans and pulses, cotton and sugarcane.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Auto Output Rises in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Brazil produced 144,400
motor vehicles in August, up 4.56 percent over July, said the
Brazilian Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association (Anfavea).
</P>
<P>
A latest Anfavea report showed that the country's auto output
in the first eight months of the year totaled 1.174 million units,
nearly 10 percent lower than the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Auto production stopped growing last November due to the
government decision to increase taxation on industrial products.
</P>
<P>
Auto output for the whole year is expected to total 1.75
million units, or a 15 percent drop from last year, said Anfavea.
The country produced 2.069 million units in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Brazil exported 276,000 units in the first eight months at a
value of 3.6 billion dollars. This represented a 10 percent
growth over the same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Auto exports for the whole year are estimated to reach 5.5
billion dollars as against the 4.8 billion dollars of 1997.

<HEADLINE> Russian Crisis Poses Little Threat To China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- The current Russian financial
crisis will have little impact on the Chinese economy, today's
China Daily cited a senior Chinese researcher as saying.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Chunlai, of the Chinese Academy of International Trade
and Co-operation, bases his conclusion on the fact that the
Chinese and Russian economies are not interdependent to any
significant degree, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that mutual investment in each other's
country is worth only about US$200 million.
</P>
<P>
Sino-Russian trade last year totalled US$6.12 billion, of which
about US$4.09 billion are imports from Russia, accounting for
merely 2.9 percent of Chinese imports. Chinese exports to Russia
only made up 1.1 percent of its total export volume.
</P>
<P>
Although the ruble slump makes Russian goods cheaper for
Chinese importers, China needs to buy little from Russia except
wood and nuclear technology for civilian use, according to the
researcher.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Russia mainly exported steel, cement, wood,
fertilizers and other chemical products to China, but the Chinese
markets for most of these commodities are now saturated, said the
paper.
</P>
<P>
Chinese customs statistics report that Russian exports to China
plunged to US$1.62 billion during the first half of this year,
down 24.3 percent from the same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, China's exports to Russia soared 48.8 percent from a
year ago to US$1.03 billion during the first six months this year.
</P>
<P>
The momentum will be maintained throughout the year, Zhang
predicted, as a result of more stable trading channels and
improved long-term strategic thinking by Chinese businesses.

<HEADLINE> Nationwide Logging Ban To Be Effective In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A nationwide logging ban
expected to become effective in China next year to help prevent
natural disasters will not only put great pressure on the timber
industry but also provide an opportunity for it to sharpen its
competitive edge, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
"An upsurge in timber prices can be expected next year when the
radical measure is fully implemented," the paper cited Wu Zurong,
secretary general of the Association of China Forestry Products
Industry, as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the industry has to give up its traditional dependence
on forestry and develop other businesses, according to the paper,
for unrestrained logging along the upper reaches of the major
rivers has caused serious erosion, raising water levels and
silting up water channels.
</P>
<P>
As an alternative, the industry may introduce advanced
technologies to develop new materials and improve efficiency, said
Wu, adding that the attempt may as well ease the pressure from
increased imports brought by the logging ban.
</P>
<P>
Planting market-oriented trees can be another choice for the
sector, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
"The government should provide encouragement to farmers to
participate in this venture," Wu was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
As one of the world's three top tree planters, forest
plantations in China have contributed more than 30 million cubic
meters of timber to the nation's industry.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the timber sector should adjust its operational
strategies to meet emerging market demands.
</P>
<P>
The robust development of residential housing, the decoration
and furniture industries, which have been stimulated by increasing
personal income, will expand timber demand significantly.
</P>
<P>
Wu's association predicts that the country will consume 119
million cubic meters of timber annually by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Some timber plants are already using bamboo, sorghum and hemp
to produce plywood, the paper said, such technology will be
applied widely in the coming years.

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices Decline Prompts Venezuela to Slash Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan government
Friday unveiled a plan to further cut down public spending by 1.15
billion U.S. dollars to ease fiscal hardships arising from the
continued decline in oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The public spending cut, in addition to the 3.5 billion dollar
adjustment made earlier in the year, will total 4.65 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Teodoro Petkoff, minister of state and head of the Presidency's
Coordination and Planning Office, said that the move is designed
to bring this year's fiscal deficit to zero.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the goal, the central government will reduce its
spending by 360 million dollars, the state oil company, Petroleos
de Venezuela, by 600 million dollars, and other non-financial
public enterprises by 180 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The price of Venezuelan oil has continuously dropped to a
little more than 11 dollars per barrel from last year's 16.49
dollars, which may result in a drop of five to six billion dollars
in the country's foreign exchange revenue.

</P>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan will not interfere
in any way in tension between Iran and Afghanistan as it has
equally good relations with both the Muslim countries.
</P>
<P>
This was stated here Saturday evening by Pakistani Foreign
Minister Sartaj Aziz upon his arrival from Durban, South Africa,
after attending the 12th Non-Aligned Movement Summit.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister expressed his hope that the tension
between Iran and Afghanistan will simmer down.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the tension will cool down as we are all trying to
find the Iranian diplomats," Aziz told the reporters while
referring to Pakistan's efforts and the recommendation of an U.N.
fact-finding mission on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said that 10 Iranian diplomats and one
correspondent from the Iranian News Agency in Afghanistan remain
missing since August 8 when the Taliban militia captured the
Northern Afghan city of Mazar-i-Sharif. The Taliban were reported
to have raided the Iranian consulate when they stormed into the
city.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government insists that the diplomats were held
hostage by the Taliban. However, the allegation has been
repeatedly denied by the Taliban authorities.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that Pakistan is working "very, very hard" to find
the Iranian diplomats. "Islamabad will do its best to maintain
good and close relation with Tehran," the foreign minister said.

<HEADLINE> Russian Crisis Tops EU Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SALZBURG, Austria, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Russian financial
crisis dominated the first-day meeting of the European Union (EU)
foreign ministers here Saturday, which was originally scheduled to
focus on the EU's reforms.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting interval, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
told reporters that the EU could send a top-level "Troika" mission
to Russia next week to help solve its financial problems only if
the political deadlock gripping that country is settled.
</P>
<P>
The mission will consist of the foreign ministers of Britain,
Austria and Germany, representing the past, current and next EU
presidency which rotates on a six-month basis.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel said that if the power tussling between Russian
President Boris Yeltsin and the State Duma could be evaporated and
Russia could stick to reforms, the EU is willing to continue
backing Russia.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel told
the Austrian TV that the crisis in Russia is not only a fiscal and
economic issue, but also a deep institutional crisis.
</P>
<P>
Schuessel, current chairman of the Council of Foreign
Ministers, added that the EU must concentrate its efforts to work
out a common strategy to deal with Russian crisis.
</P>
<P>
Except for British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook who is on
holiday in France, all other 14 EU foreign ministers are
participating in the two-day meeting.

</P>
<P>
The foreign minister expressed his hope that the tension
between Iran and Afghanistan will simmer down.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the tension will cool down as we are all trying to
find the Iranian diplomats," Aziz told the reporters while
referring to Pakistan's efforts and the recommendation of an U.N.
fact-finding mission on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said that 10 Iranian diplomats and one
correspondent from the Iranian News Agency in Afghanistan remain
missing since August 8 when the Taliban militia captured the
Northern Afghan city of Mazar-i-Sharif. The Taliban were reported
to have raided the Iranian consulate when they stormed into the
city.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government insists that the diplomats were held
hostage by the Taliban. However, the allegation has been
repeatedly denied by the Taliban authorities.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that Pakistan is working "very, very hard" to find
the Iranian diplomats. "Islamabad will do its best to maintain
good and close relation with Tehran," the foreign minister said.

<HEADLINE> Italy Favors G8 Summit on Russian Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Italy is in favor of convening a
Group of Eight meeting (G8) to discuss the economic and political
crisis in Russia, Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said in Salzburg,
Austria Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Italy agrees that a coordinated effort on the part of the G7
and the G8 is necessary not only to discuss the Russian crisis but
the global economic situation," Dini was quoted as saying by the
ANSA news agency.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between the eight major industrialized countries,
proposed by Britain, will be considered Sunday at an informal
meeting of the European Union foreign ministers being held in
Salzburg, Dini said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the EU, the minister said that the euro, the single
currency for Europe, will not only bring an element of stability
to the EU but serve as an anchor and point of reference for other
nations.
</P>
<P>
"Today, Europe is in a good position. Even though the effects
of the economic crisis in Russia and Asia may also be felt in our
countries, they have not been important so far," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But we must monitor the situation to maintain a satisfactory
growth rate in Europe."
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the crisis in Russia warrants a lowering of
interest rates in Europe, Dini said the decision is up to the
central banks in the individual EU countries and will soon be up
to the Central European Bank.
</P>
<P>
He said that he does not foresee the risk of inflation in
Europe or in Italy, noting that the economic policy in Europe is
oriented toward stability.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, it is more likely that recession-related elements
might come to the fore," he added.
</P>
<P>
Between now and the end of the year, Dini said, Italy has a
wide enough margin to align its interest rates with those of other
EU countries such as Germany and France which have the lowest.
</P>
<P>
"There is a good margin because the rates on the market are
anyhow leaning in that direction," he said.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Official Wants to Expand Legal Concept of Bigamy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Married men who support
mistresses financially and publicly treat them as wives should be
punished as bigamists, said an official from the women's
federation of south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The number of cases in which married men "have concubines" or
"support mistresses" is rising in this booming coastal province,
due to the influence of corruptive thoughts and the traditional
concept of "producing a boy to continue the family line," said Lin
Huisu, vice-chairwoman of the Guangdong Provincial Women's
Federation.
</P>
<P>
The current law appears to be weak in defining and punishing
some ugly activities which obviously belong to the scope of
"bigamy," Lin told Xinhua while attending a national women's
conference which closed in Beijing Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The provincial women's federation has already suggested that
legislative departments should re-define the crime of "bigamy" to
provide a legal basis for punishing those who support mistresses
outside of a legal marriage, she said.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese Criminal Law, a married person who weds
another and a person who weds another married person with the
knowledge of marital status are both guilty of bigamy. The
regulations on marriage registration further states that a couple
with one or both sides married to others, who live together
publicly as husbands and wives, even without legal registration of
marriage will also be defined as bigamists.
</P>
<P>
The federation suggested that any unfaithful husband who has
sex with a woman other than his wife "with the aim of producing
babies to carry on his family line," who "has long-term
cohabitation and possesses common property" with his mistress or
financially supports the mistress should be punished as bigamists,
according to Lin.
</P>
<P>
Ma Yuan, executive vice-chairman of the Chinese Judges'
Association, said that if a married man and the mistress he
supports do not live together publicly as husband and wife, they
cannot be identified as guilty of bigamy. But local governments
can certainly issue relevant administrative regulations to curb
such immoral acts, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
She said that -- based on the Chinese courts' adoption of the
principle of "no complaint, no trial" -- if the legitimate wife of
the man who supports a mistress does not appeal, the court is not
entitled to interfere with such behavior.

<HEADLINE> China PC Sales Growth Leads World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- China's PC sales will set the
mark for the global computer industry this year, today's China
Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
A total of 4.25 million PCs will be sold this year in China,
representing annual growth of 40 percent over 1997, the daily
paper quoted sources from the Ministry of Information Industry as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Sales are expected to be worth over 160 billion yuan (about
19.28 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
A report from market research company HuiCong predicts that
China's PC market will maintain growth of over 40 percent in the
next two years, bringing the total market to 8.3 million units by
2000.
</P>
<P>
The report said China's home PC market will also maintain its
growing momentum. In 1998, 1.27 million home PCs are expected to
be sold, compared with 540,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, the number of home PCs sold annually is expected to
top 3.32 million, accounting for 40 percent of all PC sales.
</P>
<P>
After a slow start in the early 1990s, the home PCs market has
swelled significantly in the past two years. Annual sales growth
has been over 50 percent since 1995.
</P>
<P>
Beijing and Shanghai lead the country in home PC penetration,
with six percent of households owning a computer.
</P>
<P>
This figure means huge potential for family PCs, experts say,
given that the comparative figure in the United States exceeds 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
Domestic PC makers dominate the Chinese market, snatching
around 60 percent of the market shares.
</P>
<P>
Experts say China's domestic PC industry has kept abreast with
world progress in sectors like research and development,
application and marketing.
</P>
<P>
The development of China's software industry is also helping
the PC sector. China's software market is expected to be worth
more than 30 billion yuan (about 3.61 billion US dollars) this
year, acting as a major catalyst to PC sales.

<HEADLINE> Biggest Dam Being Built in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A multi-purpose dam, the
Thaphanseik, which will be the biggest one in Myanmar, is being
built in Sagaing division, northern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Thaphanseik project in Kyunhla township, 14.4 kilometers
upstream the Kindat Dam, will block the Mu River for irrigation
and power generation, according to the Myanmar Ministry of
Agriculture and Irrigation.
</P>
<P>
The 6,776-meter-long and 32.4-meter-high dam will have a power
plant for generating 30 megawatts of electricity, eventually
helping irrigate more than 202,500 hectares of land and regulate
the water inflow at the Kindat and the Kaboe dams which are
located downstream.
</P>
<P>
The project, which started in September 1996, is targeted to be
completed by the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has claimed that it has built 90 dams in the country
since late 1988, irrigating nearly 546,750 hectares of farmland.
Of the 90, eight facilities were constructed in 1997-98 fiscal
year which ended in March with 184,072 hectares irrigated.

BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Highlights of today's major
Beijing-based newspapers:
</P>
<P>
 "People's Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- President Jiang Zemin has urged earnest efforts to help
people in flooded areas to cope with difficulties during an
inspection tour in northeastern China's Heilongjiang province. He
stressed that the top priority in that area is to make sure the
affected residents survive the coming winter.
</P>
<P>
-- With the fight against the floods achieving decisive
victory, the whole nation has put even more efforts into economic
construction to ensure a national growth goal of eight percent
this year. The eastern Jiangsu province and southeastern Fujian
province, for instance, are intensifying their efforts to realize
an annual economic growth of 11 percent.

<P>
-- The six-day Eighth National Congress of Chinese Women ended

</P>
<P>
-- A nationwide logging ban is anticipated that will force
fundamental changes on China's timber industry. The prohibition
is expected to benefit the country in the long run, but may result
in an upsurge in timber prices next year, when the radical measure

-- Revolutionary changes are expected in China's rigid system
for registering permanent residence, which has impeded the free
flow of labor and talent for four decades. Although the specific
measures are still uncertain, the deregulation move is hailed to
be an important step towards managing China's industrialization
and urbanization more efficiently, which is expected to encourage
ambitious business people to resettle from rural areas to cities,
encourage family reunion, and help attract all kinds of social
resources into urban hubs.

The Universal Church temple building was built more than 50
years go and is located in the center of the Osasco municipality.
</P>

The church roof had started to creak moments before it caved
in, eyewitnesses told Brazilian television. Television reports
showed firefighters using chain saws to break up the destroyed
wooden roof and tried to free the wounded.

<HEADLINE> World Champions France Draw with Iceland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Newly-crowned world champions
France were held to a 1-1 draw by Iceland in their opening
qualifying match for the 2000 European Soccer Championships on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It was the first competitive match for France under new coach
Roger Lemerre since they won the World Cup with a 3-0 win over
Brazil on July 12.
</P>
<P>
Iceland stunned France in their group four match in Reykjavik
when Rikhardur Dadason put the home side ahead after 33 minutes
following a blunder by goalkeeper Fabien Barthez who fumbled a
corner.
</P>
<P>
But Christophe Dugarry saved France's pride with an equalizer
three minutes later.
</P>
<P>
While Iceland were recording one of their best results, fellow
lightweights Cyprus scored their greatest victory with a stunning
3-2 upset win over Spain in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus's upset win came courtesy of goals by Panayiotis
Engomitis (44 minutes), Sinica Gogic (48) and Milenko
Spoljaric(77) while Spain could only score through Raul (72) and
Fernando Morientes (84).
</P>
<P>
After a disappointing World Cup, the result further undermines
the position of Spanish coach Javier Clemente who will come under
even greater pressure to quit, or be sacked.
</P>
<P>
Ireland also scored an upset victory with a 2-0 win over
Croatia, who finished third in the World Cup but had a poor
afternoon in Dublin where they had two men sent off.
</P>
<P>
Manchester United stars Denis Irwin, with a fourth minute
penalty, and Roy Keane, with a 15th minute header, secured the
points for Ireland in group eight.
</P>
<P>
Croatia had Mario Stamic and Krvnoshiv Jurcic dismissed in a
three-minute spell midway through the second half.
</P>
<P>
Another side who missed out on the World Cup finals but who
impressed on Saturday were Israel who, despite being reduced to
10 men after 58 minutes, came back to draw 1-1 with Austria in
Vienna in group six.
</P>
<P>
But there were no upsets at neutral Liverpool where Italy
shrugged off the disappointment of their World Cup failure to
overcome Wales 2-0 in group one.
</P>
<P>
Italy scored through Diego Fuser and Christian Vieri, who
finished off a fine move with a brilliant individual strike 13
minutes from time to give Dino Zoff his first competitive win as
Italy manager.
</P>
<P>
There were also wins for Sweden, Finland and Ukraine on the
day the qualifiers began in earnest after a few isolated matches
during the summer.
</P>
<P>
Sweden, who fell behind to an Alan Shearer goal after only two
minutes, came back to defeat England 2-1 and maintain their
30-year-old unbeaten record against the English.
</P>
<P>
England midfielder Paul Ince was dismissed midway through the
second half for a reckless tackle on Henrik Larsson. Sweden won
with goals from Andreas Andersson after 32 minutes and Johan
Mjallby a minute later.
</P>
<P>
England football fans were involved in a stand-off with
Swedish riot police as they left the stadium.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said windows were broken by some fans. "The
trouble was in the stadium, but it was not serious," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine scored an important win in their group four
qualifier,beating Russia 3-2.
</P>
<P>
Serhiy Popov and Serhiy Skachenko put Ukraine 2-0 ahead but
after Yevgeny Varlamov pulled one back for Russia, their
goalkeeper Dmitry Kharin was sent off for bringing down a player
in the box and Serhiy Rebrov added Ukraine's third from the
penalty spot.
</P>
<P>
Viktor Onopko scored a second for Russia in the closing
minutes. In another group four match Armenia defeated Andorra 3-1.
</P>
<P>
Finland, who had their most successful World Cup qualifying
campaign despite not reaching the finals, won an exciting group
three match 3-2 against Moldova after three goals in the first 11
minutes left Moldova 2-1 ahead.
</P>
<P>
Finland pulled level just before half-time with a goal from
Jonatan Johansson before Mixu Paatelainen scored what proved to
be their winner after 63 minutes.

<HEADLINE> Rafter Storms into Top 16 at U.S. Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Australian Patrick Rafter
only needed 66 minutes to rout his rival David Nainkin of South
Africa in the third round of the U.S. Open tennis championships
here today.
</P>
<P>
The defending champion humiliated Nainkin 6-1, 6-1, 6-1. He
won 33 of 39 first-serve points and converted seven of 10
break-point chances.
</P>
<P>
"He's a smart player," Nainkin said. "He doesn't miss too many
balls from the back. He's different. He's dangerous. He kept
firing first serves down, not giving me any rhythm. He never gave
me a chance to get back into it."
</P>
<P>
Rafter said: "There's a certain pressure that goes with Grand
Slams. It was very important to get through that first round. You
feel big relief. The first round is always more difficult in a m
ajor and the defending champion has never lost in the first round
at the U.S. Open."
</P>
<P>
Rafter will meet Goran Ivanisevic, who beat Paul Haarhuis of
the Netherlands 7-6, 6-3, 6-4 Saturday. "I think he'll be very
dangerous," Rafter said. "I've got to get his serve back. If I
concentrate, there's no reason I can't win."

<HEADLINE> Sichuan Closes Down Timber-Products Trade Centers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, September 6 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Sichuan
Province has shut down all timber-products trade centers in six
prefectures and cities along the upper reaches of the Yangtze
River as part of its formal implementation of the tree-logging ban
which went into effect on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
So far, all 54 counties, encompassing 4.6 million hectares, in
western Sichuan have stopped the deforestation of old-growth
forests in an effort to prevent silting which raises water levels
and contributes to flooding.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government also plans to plant 1.83 million
hectares of trees and close 8.97 million hectares of forests to
logging over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan is one of China's three top forest areas, and more than
70 forest-related industrial enterprises have been established in western
Sichuan's primitive forest areas.
</P>
<P>
The great amount of tree harvesting over the past few decades
has resulted in more than 600 million tons of silt a year being
swept into the upper reaches of the Yangtze River from its branches
in Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
Beginning on August 31, several fact-finding teams headed by
governor Song Baorui and other top provincial officials went to
these forest areas to make certain that logging had ceased and the
forests were protected.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 6 (Xinhua) -- "Jews share one thing in
common with the Chinese -- a deep appreciation of history and
tradition," said Fred Kort, a Jewish-American known as the "Bubble
King" in the United States for his small bottles of bubbles for
kids.
</P>
<P>
Now, bubbles are floating in Beijing. Kort came here to attend
a signing ceremony of a memo on dispatching 100 Chinese with
doctoral degrees to Israel's Bar-Ilan University for further
study, starting next month.
</P>
<P>
"My wife and I are proud of the opportunity to sponsor these
post-graduate students from China," Kort said in an interview with
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
According to the memo, these doctors receiving grants will
study physics, biochemistry, mathematics, social sciences and
Jewish studies at Bar-Ilan University in the coming years, thanks
to a Sino-Israeli post-doctoral fellowship program sponsored by
Kort.
</P>
<P>
"I do not know anyone in the world who has 100 children that
are all doctors," said the 74-year-old Kort. "I consider myself a
very proud father."
</P>
<P>
Kort, now chairman of the Los Angeles-based Imperial Toy Corp.,
is one of only nine Jews to have survived the Treblinka
concentration camp in north-central Poland. Some
700,000-to-800,000 Jews were exterminated there during World War
II.

After arriving in the United States in 1947 with five cents in
his pocket Kort, then 24, served as an electrician in a hotel and
a manufacturers' representative for other toy manufacturers.
</P>

"I never looked back. So I rolled up my sleeves and went to
work," said Kort, now a well-known philanthropic supporter of Yad
Vashem, the Shoah Foundation, the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum,
the Anti-Defamation League and Israel Bonds.
</P>
<P>
"Education is the most important component in a person's

Kort does most of his manufacturing business in China. "As a

"I believe that the satisfaction of giving far outweighs the
pleasure of receiving," he added.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Ruling Coalition Faces Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The co-ruling Hungarian
Democratic Union of Romania (UDMR) said on Saturday they would
quit the ruling coalition if Parliament did not pass the changing
of the Education Law by end-September.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal decision was made by members of the UDMR Council
of Representatives gathered in northern city Cluj-Napoca. The UDMR
president Marko Bela asked at the meeting for a "firm decision" on
the Union's position within the governmental coalition.
</P>
<P>
Unhappy with the negative vote recently cast in the Chamber of
Deputies over the establishment of a Hungarian-speaking public
university asked by the UDMR, Marko Bela said that "unless the
coalition correct its mistakes, UDMR will not be able to accompany
the coalition any further."
</P>
<P>
The Commission for Education within the Chamber of Deputies
adopted last Wednesday a very intransigent position regarding the
problem of founding a Hungarian-speaking university during the
debate of the bill for the modification of the Education Law. The
members of the commission rejected the idea of founding a
university in the language of the minorities.
</P>
<P>
The bill named Ordinance 36 was issued by former Ciorbea
Cabinet and included major changes to the Education Law. The
changes would satisfy the UDMR's requests over the use on a large
scale of the maternal language in education. The bill is yet to be
let pass by the plenum of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Hungarians of Romania started to ask for a
Hungarian-speaking public university after the fall of Ceausescu
in 1989. According to the last census, out of 23 million citizens
of Romania, about 1.6 million-strong are Hungarians.

<HEADLINE> Trimble to Hold Direct Talks with Adams Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's Ulster
Unionist Party on Saturday allowed its leader David Trimble to
hold face-to-face talks with Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough meeting is expected to take place on Tuesday
or Wednesday, following a meeting of party leaders on Northern
Ireland's future seat of government on Monday, according to BBC
report from Belfast.
</P>
<P>
The decision by the 110-strong executive of the Ulster Unionist
Party followed discussion on tactics for the resumption later this
month of the new Northern Ireland Assembly.
</P>
<P>
A senior member of the executive, and a member of the new
Assembly, Dermot Nesbitt, said a meeting between Trimble and Adams
was an inevitable next step. Trimble is also the First Minister of
the newly established assembly.
</P>
<P>
Nesbitt said it was part of the "natural progress" of the
political process.
</P>
<P>
The peace process in Northern Ireland has made remarkable
advance in the past week. Sinn Fein formally renounced violence
early this week and then appointed a senior figure to the
international decommissioning body set up to oversee Irish
Republic Army disarmament, a clear sign of willingness in giving
up weapons.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein welcomed the decision which is seen as another
important step in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Trimble is likely to use the meeting to press Adams for further
progress in disarming the republican terrorists.
