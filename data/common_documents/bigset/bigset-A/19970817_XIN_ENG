<HEADLINE> Natural Gas Open Interest in UK Sets New Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Open interest for the
International Petroleum Exchange's (IPE) new natural gas contract
has reached a new record at 6210 lots, according to an
announcement by the IPE here today.
</P>
<P>
This is equivalent to nearly 190 million therms of natural gas,
more than double the daily level of production in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Open interest for natural gas futures has been increasing
steadily since the contract was launched on January 31 this year.
</P>
<P>
The IPE said volumes of trade have also been increasing. So far
this month average daily trading volumes have been more than 330
lots (equivalent to about 10 million therms, or 15 percent of
daily UK production).
</P>
<P>
This compares with an average of 220 lots a day in July. The
contract is attracting increasing interest within the natural gas
industry.
</P>
<P>
Natural gas futures are traded as a monthly strip of daily
deliveries at the National Balancing Point (NBP) within the UK's
National Transmission System.
</P>
<P>
The NBP has emerged as the focus for trading within the UK
natural gas market.
</P>
<P>
Each lot is 1,000 therms a day for an individual month, and
trade is carried out in multiples of five lots.
</P>
<P>
Richard Ward, executive vice president of Business Development
at the IPE, said, "It is clear that the natural gas future
contract is becoming increasingly important to the industry."
</P>
<P>
"We are working very closely with the companies and individuals
to ensure that their risk management needs are met, and we will
continue to develop the contract to take advantage of further
opportunities in the UK and Europe," he added.

<HEADLINE> Cuba, China Win on Second Day of Hong Kong Women's Volleyball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Olympic champion Cuba and
runner-up China won their respective matches on the second day at
the the Hong Kong leg of the World Women's Volleyball Grand Prix
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Cuba won over Italy 15-9, 15-6, 15-8 in 59 minutes for its
second win here, while the Chinese team scored its first victory
by beating the Japanese side 15-7, 15-5, 15-11.
</P>
<P>
The high-leaping Cubans proved to be too much for the Italians,
especially when they launched their trade-mark spikes. The
Italians seemed lacking the steam they enjoyed last night when
they beat China 3-2.
</P>
<P>
"The Italians did not play as well as they could. They were
tired today since they fourght a hard match against China
yesterday," said Cuban coach Antonio Perdomo.
</P>
<P>
But the veteran coach declined to predict their match against
China Sunday. He simply said: "That will be very hard."
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese did not play well yesterday. They failed to make
very effective attacks in the first two sets, although they
imporved their game later in the match," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Things will change and maybe today they will be better and
tomorrow they are more defferent," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Cuba is the world best even if they have recently changed the
line-up. They jump high and launch powerful smashes which were
hard to block," said Julio Velasco, head coach of the Italian team.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a very good experience to play the best team in
the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Velasco admitted that his team played a hard and sensetive
match last night and the team still lacked the skills for
effective receiving.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese fielded an all-veteran line-up in the opening set
against Japan. The set went almost all the Chinese way, except
for the middle part when the Japanese won six points in a row
through the strength of jump serves by Minako Onuri.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese won the two following sets 15-5 and 15-11, also
with flatuations during the latter part of the sets.
</P>
<P>
Chinese head coach Lang Ping said that her players played to
their form tonight. But they failed to launch counter-attacks and
lacked a good coordination in the late stages of the three sets,
when the Japanese launched threatening jump serves to foil Chinese
first setters.
</P>
<P>
"This is anyway only the fifth game for the new Chinese
team. The new players have not confronted themselves with many
strong sides," Lang explained.
</P>
<P>
The spiker-turned coach said that she would, as in the matches
played so far, field some newcomers Sunday. "I have only six
veterans in the team. How can I ignore the new ones, especially
when they need to obtain experience through competitions of this
caliber," she said.
</P>
<P>
She declined to predict the eventual winners of the three-day
event. "I have never done so, even before or during the Olympic
Games," she dais.
</P>
<P>
"I have always asked my players to be really serious and give
their best shots, no matter what team they are to play," Lang
added.
</P>
<P>
The top three teams from the five legs of this year's Grand
Prix join host Japan in the finals set for August 29-31 in Kobe,
Japan.
</P>
<P>
In the Taipei leg of the Grand Prix earlier Saturday, Russia
won its second match by beating South Korea 15-5, 15-9, 15-8 while
the Netherlands scored their first win by downing the United
States 15-2, 15-12, 15-5.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, South Korea beat the United States 15-4, 15-4, 15-4
and Russia downed the Netherlands 15-0, 16-14, 15-2.
</P>
<P>
On the leg's final day on Sunday, South Korea takes on the
Netherlands and the United States will play Russia.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Adheres to Neutral Policy on Afghan Issue: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani President Farooq
Leghari said today that his country adheres to a policy of strict
neutrality and non-interference in the internal affairs of
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
As a neighboring country, "we have a vital stake in durable
peace and stability in the region," Leghari told Lukhdar Brahimi,
special envoy of the UN Secretary General on Afghanistan, who
called on him at the Presidential Palace here today.
</P>
<P>
Leghari said that Pakistan fully supports the peace efforts by
the United Nations aimed at bringing about harmony and
conciliation among the rival Afghan factions and restoring peace
and stability in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He referred to the enormous economic benefit which would accrue
to the countries of the region through mega oil and gas pipeline
projects once peaceful conditions prevailed in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He also spoke about Pakistan's efforts towards the
establishment of a broad-based government in Afghanistan which
took into account all ethnic groups in the country.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi said that the UN Secretary General was committed to
help the Afghan people in resolving their problems and restoring a
lasting peace in their country.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that serious efforts being made by the UN and Pakistan
would yield positive results.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi arrived here Friday morning on a two-week mission to
assess the Afghan situation for the UN's further actions for
restoration of peace in that country.

JOHANNESBURG, August 16 (Xinhua) -- South Afirca beat Republic
of Congo 1-0 on Saturday to book a spot in the World Cup soccer
finals for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Phil Masinga scored at the 14th minute before a sellout crowd
of more than 80,000, including Deputy President Thabo Mbeki and
about 30 government ministers and deputies at FNB Stadium.
</P>
<P>
The two teams had been tied for first in Africa Group Three.
Republic of Congo's Red Devils won a contentious first-round
encounter 2-0 in April at Pointe-Noire, but the South African
defense was stifling and got its second straight shutout.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's 1-0 effectively gave South Africa a two-goal lead,
because a tie would also advance them for their better goal
differential than Republic of Congo.

CAIRO, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are the business
briefs from the Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkish Airlines (THY) has announced to increase the
price of domestic flights by 17.02 percent, local newspaper Daily
News said Friday.
</P>
<P>
This decision was announced on Thursday by the Istanbul-based
THY, the paper said, adding the new prices will be effective as
of September 1.
</P>
<P>
For example, an air ticket from Ankara to Istanbul, which had
an old price of 9.4 million Turkish lira (around 58 U.S. dollars)
will be sold for 10.8 million Turkish lira (around 67
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Summer is always a golden season in Turkey for both foreign and
home tourists who love sunny sea beaches. This is believed to be
main cause of the provisional increase of the price.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- A new airway will be inaugurated between Cairo and
Kuala Lumpur on October 6, as a result of Egyptian Prime Minister
Kamal El-Ganzouri's recent visit to Malaysia, according to the
latest issue of the Middle East Economic Weekly published here.
</P>
<P>
The report said the new airway will start with two weekly trips
with a stopover either in Dubai or Beirut, but there will be
direct flights after the route become established.
</P>
<P>
The aim of this new airway is to encourage trade between Egypt
and Malaysia and for tourism promotion, the report quoted Sayed
Ragab, assistant foreign minister for Asian affairs as saying.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The number of tourists visiting Egypt in the year
1996/97 ending last June increased by 15.2 percent compared to
that of the previous year to reach 4.1 million. The number of
tourist nights spent by those tourists also rose by 14 percent,
Egyptian Tourism Minister Mamdouh Al-Beltagui said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said in a report submitted to the Secretary of the
National Democratic Party that the tourists who come to Egypt
comprises groups from all over the world. He said the number of
tourists from Arab countries increased by 20.1 percent than that
of the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Commences Talks With IMF Over Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Finance Minister Musalia
Mudavadi today said that the Kenyan government had opened up
discussions with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) over the
suspended 215 million U.S. Dollars loan to Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a fund-raising occasion, Mudavadi said
that the government was ready to fulfil tough conditions imposed
by IMF and expressed optimism that the talks would be successful.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Kenya had made a lot of progress in such
areas as liberalization of the economy, privatization of
state-owned companies and retrenchment of the civil service where
the IMF had raised concern.
</P>
<P>
Micah Cheserem, Governor of the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK),
said yesterday that the government was ready to resume "tough
negotiations" with the IMF over the lapse of the Enhanced
Structural Adjustment Facility.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is considering re-opening talks with IMF
for the remaining two-year arrangement of the loan agreed in
April last year between the Kenyan government and IMF, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Washington-based IMF suspended on July 31 its key loan to
Kenya, citing high-level corruption in Kenya's government
departments as the main reason.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot President Blames Turkish Cypriot Leader for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides today blamed Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash for the
collapse of their negotiations on the Cyprus problem held in
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival here from the U.N.-led talks, Clerides said it is
generally accepted by the U.N. and all those envoys monitoring the
Glion direct talks that Denktash is exclusively at fault for the
failure of the five-day talks which ended Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Denktash did not go there to negotiate, but to try to impede
our course towards Europe," he said, adding "this did not succeed."
</P>
<P>
Denktash has threatened to finalize Cyprus' partition of Cyprus
if the European Union (EU) will go ahead with its planned
accession talks with Cyprus scheduled for early next year, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The threats are doomed to fail because the EU will not change
its decisions, the president asserted.
</P>
<P>
Clerides stressed that Denktash's recalcitrant tactics at the
talks have elicited "strong international reaction."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the conviction that the U.N. Secretary-General's
Special Advisor for the Cyprus problem, Diego Cordovez, will
"call things by their true name" in his report to the
U.N. Security Council next Wednesday and will apportion blame for
the failure of the talks where it is due.
</P>
<P>
The president said that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan will
work to set up another face-to-face meeting between the two
leaders, but he reiterated he would not attend such a meeting if
Denktash refuses to discuss substantial aspects of the Cyprus
problem.
</P>
<P>
Clerides also left the door open for further meetings between
himself and Denktash in Cyprus to discuss humanitarian issues,
saying that they "may still be possible."
</P>
<P>
Last month, the two communities' leaders had two meetings
in Nicosia, under the auspices of the U.N. Resident
Representative Gustave Feissel, and reached an agreement on
humanitarian issues.
</P>
<P>
The two meetings followed the first round of direct talks
between them, held from July 9 to 12, at Troutbeck, near New
York.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unresolved since 1974 when
the island was divided after Turkish troops invaded and took
over the northern third in the wake of a failed coup seeking
union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and international community have been trying for
decades to reunite this island nation as bi-communal and
bi-zonal federation through peace talks, but so far no tangible
results have been achieved.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Again Blasts Israel's Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat today repeated his condemnation of the Israeli sanctions
against the Palestinian people, imposed after the suicide bombing
attack on July 30 in Jerusalem, which killed 16 people.
</P>
<P>
In an open meeting with Palestinian journalists, academics,
university officials and teachers in the headquarters of the
Nablus Municipality, Arafat spoke about various topics on the
latest political developments, according to a report of JMCC, an
East Jerusalem-based Palestinian press service.
</P>
<P>
He declared that the Palestinians reject Israel's request for
increasing efforts to counter terror against Israel. "We reject
all efforts to impose conditions or dictate to us," he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the act by Israel to hold up monetary transfers
owed to the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) is nothing short
of an attempt to steal tax money belonging to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's statement coincided with a Washington report that the
U.S. has openly voiced its disappointment at Israel's delay in
releasing funds to the PNA.
</P>
<P>
Dealing with domestic problems, Arafat stressed the importance
of the media, saying that it should do its best to enhance the
national ideal of the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader encouraged the media to represent the
conscience of a struggling people by sharpening their pens for the
battle. He also asked the academics to form a national committee
to document the history of Palestine.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 16 (Xinhua) -- A special envoy from Comoros
said today that calm had been back to Comoros and negotiations
between the cessationists and the government were on course.
</P>
<P>
Unrest arised on August 3 when secessionists of Anjouan, the
second island of the Comoros, demanded a return to French rule
and the Comoran government later sent troops to quell the
secessionists revolt.
</P>
<P>
The Comoran special envoy, Abdou Bakari Boina, today delivered
a special message to Kenyan Foreign Minister Kalonzo Musyoka from
Comoros President Abdul Karim Taki.
</P>
<P>
Bakari Boina told reporters that the present crisis in the
islands was partly a creation of the international press.
</P>
<P>
He refuted news reports that a four-man delegation sent by the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) to the islands was abducted
by government soldiers early this week.
</P>
<P>
In fact, he pointed out, the OAU delegation led by Pierre Yere
from Cote d'Ivoire was being escorted and provided with security
by his government.
</P>
<P>
Bakari Boina is expected to deliver similar special messages
to the governments of Tanzania, Mozambique and South Africa.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The AIDS epidemic continues to
take its toll in Zimbabwe with the total number of reported AIDS
cases reaching at 63,937 as of December 1996.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a youth ''AIDS Festival" here today, Gabriel
Machinga,Zimbabwean Minister of Education, Sport and Culture disclosed
that it was
estimated that cumulative AIDS cases since the end of December
1996 was four times that figure.
</P>
<P>
"The most affected age group are young people aged 20 to 30,"
he said, adding that the prevalence of the HIV infection which
causes AIDS was also increasing among youths of 15 to 19 years
old.
</P>
<P>
"The tragedy is that there is no prospect of finding a cure or
a vaccine in the near future, which leaves us with prevention as
the only weapon against STD(sexually-transmitted
diseases)/HIV/AIDS," the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
Machinga appealed for positive behavioral change to reduce the
risk of HIV infection.
</P>
<P>
"The temptation for youths to take risks and experiment with
lives and sometimes with drugs, alcohol and even with their
bodies, puts them at very high risk of infection with sexually
transmitted diseases," he said.

<HEADLINE> Rybkin on Upcoming Yeltsin-Maskhadov Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov are to held a meeting in
Moscow Monday and to sign a document to follow up on earlier
agreements, Russian Security Council Secretary Ivan Rybkin said
here today.
</P>
<P>
According to the Itar-Tass news agency, Rybkin today had talks
with Chechen First Prime Minister Movladi Udugov, who arrived in
Moscow today with a Chechen delegation, that led up to the signing
of a protocol of the upcoming summit.
</P>
<P>
It took a long time to weigh the date and place for the two
presidents' meeting.
</P>
<P>
In a move to "put an end to all unwanted comments on the
upcoming meeting of the presidents," Udugov said both sides agreed
that the meeting should be held in Moscow and Maskhadov approved
of their choice.
</P>
<P>
On the question of hostages, the Russian and foreign hostages
kidnapped in Chechnya totaled 14 as of recent days. Both Rybkin
and Udugov agreed to sign a protocol on the issue Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The protocol will include a provision that the relatives of
those missing, killed or abducted, will be appointed members of
the commission dealing with these issues. They will be allowed to
conduct the search in any part of Chechnya or Russia.
</P>
<P>
Referring to economic problems, Rybkin noted that the amount of
funds transferred to Chechnya since the beginning of this year has
reached 847 billion roubles (about 148 million US dollars). This
is the first time this figure has been publicly announced, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Rybkin also said that the federal government plans to transfer
120 billion roubles (about 21 million US dollars ) to Chechnya
monthly. Besides, it will also finance the repairs on the oil
pipeline passing through Chechnya and its protection.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Udugov quoted Maskhadov as saying that Chechnya
should be able to rebuild its economy on its own.
</P>
<P>
But, at the same time the Chechen government has given Moscow a
plan of economic restoration, which, Udugov hopes, could help
improve the economic situation in the republic faster.

<HEADLINE> Tajik Government Troops to Take Offensive to Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Tajik government is sending
more troops to the Shaartuz and Kabodien districts in the south of
the country where the rebel brigade of Colonel Makhmud
Khudoiberdyev and his armed supporters had moved in Friday night.
</P>
<P>
According to an Itar-Tass news agency report from Dushanbe,
Tajikistan, Tajik government troops are getting ready for a
large-scale offensive to destroy the last pocket of resistance.
</P>
<P>
Itar-Tass quoted a high-placed source in one of the power
ministries as saying Khudoiberdyev has neither means nor chances
to put up long resistance.
</P>
<P>
The source believes that the only wise thing for him to do is
to lay down arms and stop armed confrontation. Otherwise, all
responsibility for the consequences will lie on the mutinous
colonel and all those who support his adventurist and foolhardy
plans.
</P>
<P>
Another report said that U.S. Permanent Representative to the
United Nations Bill Richardson arrived in Dushanbe today to
familiarize himself with the settlement process in Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
According to Richardson, the U.N. Security Council and U.S.
President Bill Clinton want to know what help is needed to
facilitate this process.
</P>
<P>
During the one-day stay in the capital the U.S. representative
is expected to talk with Tajik President Emomali Rakhmonov and
Foreign Minister Talbak Nazarov.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Tajik government forces took full control of
most of southern Tajikistan, except the Shaartuz and Kabodien
districts, which Khudoiberdyev's brigade and armed supporters are
based on.

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today suggested parents take advantage of higher education
programs just signed into law as part of the balanced-budget
package to begin preparing for their children's college education.
</P>
<P>
In his weekly radio address today, Clinton said parents should
get early preparation for college when their children reach the
sixth grade.
</P>
<P>
He also announced a campaign by the Department of Education to
inform people about the new tax breaks that will become available
over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Among the tax incentives included in the new five-year balanced
budget law are the Hope scholarships, a tax credit of up to 1,500
U.S. dollars to help cover the first two years of college, an
additional 10,000 dollar tax break for some families, and a new
life-time learning credit aimed at college juniors, seniors,
graduate students and adults wanting to enhence their skills.
</P>
<P>
Parents and grandparents can also withdraw money from their
Individual Retirement Accounts (IRA), beginning this January,
without penalty to pay for higher education expenses.
</P>
<P>
They can also open new education IRAs, in which they can
invest 500 dollars per child every year to build up money
tax-free for college.
</P>
<P>
The program also includes the largest increase in Pell grants
in 20 years and gives scholarships to about 350,000 more
students.

<HEADLINE> Disappeared S. Leonean FM Back in Freetown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Pallo Bangura, Foreign Minister of
Sierra Leone's military government, who disappeared after the
failed Abidjan peace talks at the end of July, has resurfaced in
the capital Freetown, saying that he has gone for "quiet diplomacy".
</P>
<P>
"Now I'm alive, I've not been kidnapped, not been killed and
I'm back in Sierra Leone," he was quoted by the British Broadcasting
Company today.
</P>
<P>
Bangura denied that he had quarreled with the junta and quit
from the military government.
</P>
<P>
"I'am back in Sierra Leone and continuing with my job," he
said.
</P>
<P>
As for what he has been doing during the last two weeks,
Bangura said he was carrying out "what is in my own style, that
is quiet diplomacy", which "the people who should know, the head
of state knew."
</P>
<P>
According to the foreign minister, his quiet diplomatic
mission "was very successful and we are now looking forward to a
positive next step".
</P>
<P>
"We are looking forward to progress in the sense of dealing
with the crisis in Sierra Leone which we want to see successfully
settled," he added.
</P>
<P>
Bangura refused to comment on the recent meeting of west
African foreign ministers in Accra, Ghana, which insisted on the
reinstatement of ousted President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah and more
sanctions against Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
"When they do get in touch with us, we will respond
appropriately," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bangura headed the junta delegation last month to Abidjan,
Cote d'Ivoire, to attend talks with west African countries'
foreign ministers for final settlement of the crisis in his
country.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, Bangura and senior diplomat Dauda Kamara
met with Cote d'Ivoire's Foreign Minister Amara Essy on August 1
and did not return to the luxury hotel where the delegation
lodged.
</P>
<P>
Speculations went around that he might have been hijacked,
kidnapped, killed or even gone to seek political asylum in
Ethiopia, where he had served in the Sierra Leonean Embassy,
while Karmara could have sought refuge in Britain.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Bangura's wife had criticized him
vehemently for associating himself with the junta.
</P>
<P>
However, Bangura denied such family quarrel, saying he had
dealt with the question at a press conference he gave in Freetown
at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
"I hope I have dealt with it definitively," he said, adding
that instead of trying to persuade him to quit the government,
his wife should receive the fact that he had taken the job.
</P>
<P>
Bangura was pride of his job as foreign minister of the junta,
saying it gave him an opportunity to pursue the peace process and
seek progress, development and democracy in the country.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Win Women's World Volleyball Grand Prix in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Olympic champions Cuba
defeated runners-up China 3-1 and claimed the title with three
straight victories at the three-day Hong Kong leg of the World
Women's Volleyball Grand Prix here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Cuba, who had earlier defeated Japan and Italy in straight
sets, outplayed China 16-14, 15-11, 8-15, 15-7.
</P>
<P>
Italy came to the second place with two wins against one loss,
China ranked third with two losses and one win and winless Japan
was fourth and last.
</P>
<P>
After finishing second and third in the Macao and Hong Kong
legs, China failed to reach the finals.
</P>
<P>
"With the cancellation of the Jakarta leg, we have had one less
leg to play. That cost a lot on us," Chinese head coach Lang Ping
 said.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that China failed to make the finals in
the history of the World Volleyball Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
In the first match here Sunday afternoon, Italy beat Japan
15-2, 15-10, 15-6. It was their first victory over Japan in any
official competition.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese fielded an all-veteran line-up in the opening set
against Cuba, and improved their defense. But the Cubans took the
set 16-14 anyway.
</P>
<P>
The Cubans pulled away after the two sides tied 7-7 in the
second set and, by gradually widening the gap, took the second
15-11.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese pulled one set back in the third, where they almost
led all the way through to a 15-8 win after a 1-1 early tie.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese came to lead at 3-1 in the fourth, but that did not
last long as the Cubans fought back with more effective and
accurate spikes. Chinese defense was greatly foiled. The Cubans
took the set 15-7 and the match.
</P>
<P>
"This match is very important to both of us. If we lose, we'd
have little chance to go to the finals," said Cuban head coach
Antonio Perdomo.
</P>
<P>
The veteran coach admitted his team was greatly pressed during
the first two sets.
</P>
<P>
Very happy with his team though, he said that he would be most
happy if China entered the finals. "We really wish to play China
in the finals," he said.
</P>
<P>
China's head coach Lang Ping said that her players had played
to their form. "But they had some problem dealing the crucial
moment, too eager to crush the opponents by spiking," she said.
</P>
<P>
"They need more time for psychological training and
experience," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Our team really didn't have enough time to get ready for this
Grand Prix competition, frankly speaking, just one month after the
 new team was formed," she explained.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team would well learn from Grand Prix matches and
get themselves ready for the week-long Asian volleyball
championships set to start on September 21 in Manila, Lang said.
</P>
<P>
In the Grand prix Taipei leg which closed Sunday, South Korea
beat the Netherlands 15-7, 15-3, 15-5 and Russia downed the United
States 17-15, 15-4, 15-2 in the final two matches.
</P>
<P>
Russia took the first place with three straight wins, South
Korea was second with two wins against one loss, the Netherlands
finished third with one win and two losses and winless Americans
were fourth and last.
</P>
<P>
The Grand Prix has five legs for the preliminary stage. After
Macao, Seoul, Hong Kong and Taipei, only one leg remains, which is
the Gifu event on August 22-24, with Russia, United States, Cuba
and Japan participating.
</P>
<P>
The top three out of the eight participating teams in the
preliminary stage will join hosts Japan in the finals set for
August 29-31 in Kobe, Japan.

<HEADLINE> China's Industry Sees Speedy, Sustained Growth in Five Years (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China's industrial structure also witnessed profound changes in
the period. The proportion of industrial assets and output values
held by non-state-owned industrial enterprises steadily increased.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the proportion of state-owned
industrial assets and output values dropped from 74.4 percent and
56.2 percent in 1992 to 56.2 percent and 28.5 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned sector, however, has still held the controlling
position among the sectors of strategic significance for the
national economy, including oil and natural gas exploration, coal
mining, electricity generation and ferrous and non-ferrous
industries.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, small industrial enterprises became
more active and played more important role in China's
industry. But large- and medium-sized enterprises were still the
pillars of the industry.
</P>
<P>
The report indicated that the state enterprise reform in the
past five years has been accelerated. The State Council, the
country's cabinet, and other economic decision-making departments
introduced a series of measures, such as enterprise restructuring,
formation of enterprise groups, trial operation of enterprise
bankruptcy and merging, so as to decentralized the enterprise
management and hone its competitive edge in the market.
</P>
<P>
The report predicted that China's industry in the years ahead
is to keep its current development momentum. Thanks to the
improved supply of energy and raw materials and the stable
investment and consumption markets, China's industry in remaining
years of the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) period will stay on
its current fast track. The contribution of China's industry to
the gross domestic product is expected to be further increased.
</P>
<P>
Some problems have to be tackled for the long-term development
of China's industry, said the report, which listed certain tough
issues; A number of enterprise are still operating in red, the
overall economic efficiency of the industrial enterprises is still
low, some state enterprises could not gear up to the market
economy, and the overall industrial structure needs to be adjusted
even more.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- China's industry has rebounded
from its stagnant period in the early 1990s and ushered in a new
round of sound, speedy and sustained growth, according to a report
recently released by China's State Statistics Bureau (SSB).
</P>
<P>
The report said that its development in the past five years
could be divided into three phases.
</P>
<P>
The industry recorded fast growth in 1992 and 1993. The added
values of China's industry in the two years posted respective
growth of 21.2 percent and 20.1 percent. The overall industrial
output value raised 24.7 percent and 27.3 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government in 1994 introduced a series of reform
measures in such key fields as finance, taxation, foreign exchange
and investment. The industrial growth rate in the year dropped to
18.9 percent while the output value kept a high increase of 24.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
The industrial growth in the ensuing two years further slowed
down owing to the relatively tight macro-economic situation. The
added values in the two years moved up 14.3 percent and 12.5
percent and the output values rose by 20.3 percent and 16.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
The industrial scale in the past five years swelled markedly.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, China had total industrial assets worth
8,573 billion yuan. The added values of industry in the year
totaled 2,908 billion yuan; the industrial output value, 9,959
billion yuan; and taxes, 519.7 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> 14.7 million US Dollars Paid to HK Traffic Accident Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Social Welfare
Department paid out over 115 million HK dollars (14.7 million
U.S. dollars) in the 1995-1996 financial year to help traffic
accident victims or their dependents.
</P>
<P>
The payment came from the department's Traffic Accident Victims
Assistance (TAVA) Fund.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1995-1996 TAVA Fund annual report, a total of
5,868 applications were received during the period, compared with
5,740 in the previous year, representing an increase of 2.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
However, police figures showed that there was a 1.9 percent
decrease in the number of traffic casualties, from 20,357 in the
1994-1995 to 19,972 in the year reported.
</P>
<P>
"The increase in application rate indicates that more people
are aware of their right to apply for assistance in the event of
traffic accidents," a department spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
The largest payment of the year amounting to 113,901 HK dollars
(14,603 U.S. dollars) was granted to the dependents of a man who
was knocked down by a taxi on April 18, 1995 and subsequently died
three weeks later.
</P>
<P>
The department handled 38 cases of serious traffic accidents
involving heavy casualties during the period.
</P>
<P>
The accident resulting in the largest number of victims
occurred on May 24, 1995 when a coach collided with two lorries,
in which 57 people were injured.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman explained that the TAVA scheme was designed to
provide speedy financial assistance to victims or their
dependents.
</P>
<P>
Applications for assistance, either in person or by post,
should be made within six months of the traffic accident which
must have been reported to the police.

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, August 17 (Xinhua) -- North China's Hebei
Province has scored remarkable economic progress by taking
advantage of its favorable geographical conditions.
</P>
<P>
Adjacent to Bohai Bay, the province surrounds two of the
country's municipalities, the capital city of Beijing and north
China's largest port city of Tianjin. Its providential location
has encouraged Hebei to increase economic cooperation with
domestic and overseas partners.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the province handled 3.46 billion US dollars of
exports, a 98.9 percent rise from the 1991 sum, and had 73.5
million US dollars in foreign exchange from local overseas
tourists, a 66.3 percent rise from the 1991 figure.
</P>
<P>
During the five years from 1992 to 1996, the province used 4.2
billion US dollars of foreign investment, 6.7 times the total it
had registered by 1991.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Japan Plans to Send War Planes Abroad for War Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Defense Agency plans to
send a main battle fighter jet force equipped with F-15 jet
fighters abroad for a multinational war game and inflight
refueling training next year, the Tokyo Shimbun reported today.
</P>
<P>
The war game, which will involve U.S., British and Canadian air
forces, will be held in Alaska, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo Shimbun said it will be unprecedented for Japan's Air
Self-Defense Force to participate in a military exercise and
inflight refueling training abroad.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Agency will make a decision on the plan at an
agency meeting scheduled for August 20, according to the Tokyo
Shimbun.
</P>
<P>
The United States started the multinational military exercise
in 1991, in the form of actual combat. The exercise is held four
times a year.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Air Self-Defense Force started to dispatch
researchers to watch the exercise in 1992. In 1996, Japan for the
first time sent two C-130 transport planes and surface-to-air
missiles to participate in the exercise. On June 9-20, The
Japanese Air Self-Defense Force participated in the exercise in
the same scale.
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo Shimbun commented that as a country pursuing a
national policy of pure defense, Japan has always been strict in
sending war planes abroad. On inflight refueling training, former
Japanese prime minister Kakuei Tanaka pointed out in 1973 that
"Japan does not possess inflight refueling planes, nor does it
participate in inflight training or exercise."
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that in relation to efforts between the
United States and Japan to review their defense cooperation
guidelines, the Japanese Defense Agency's plan to send war planes
to participate a military exercise abroad is a noteworthy
development.

and India will be further enhanced if both sides maintain an
attitude of seeking solution to problems in a spirit of mutual
accommodation, said an Indian diplomat here.

common rivers, both countries also face a series of disputes such
as cross-border insurgency, smuggling and boundary line
delimitation.

liberalization in both countries has opened up new opportunities
to liberate potentials of their peoples.

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Attracts Growing Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chongqing, August 17 (Xinhua) -- A rapidly increasing number of
people are flocking to the Three Gorges areas along the Yangtze
River to marvel at the natural wonder -- before the river is
dammed up by the year end as part of a multi-million construction
project.
</P>
<P>
Some 114,000 people from home and abroad toured the area
between January and June this year, a figure representing a 38
percent rise over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
While tourism companies report booming business, enthusiastic
tourists, however, are frustrated by the difficulty in securing
seats at touring ships.
</P>
<P>
As the peak season usually comes in September and October, the
number of tourists to the Three-Gorge region is expected to hit a
record high this year, according to the industry's analysis.
</P>
<P>
One reason for the increase is the fear that the dam-up of the
river in the region within the year might more or less damage the
Three-Gorges' natural beauty.
</P>
<P>
Tourism authorities have worked hard to dispel such groundless
anticipation, assuring repeatedly that with good preservation,
tourists will enjoy no less of nature's beauty, but more of
quality service.

<HEADLINE> China Builds Another Hydro-power Project in Border Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government recently
officially approved the construction of another large hydro-power
project in Lancang River in southwest China's Yunnan Province
bordering Myanmar and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Dachaoshan Power Plant, located in the middle reaches of the
Lancang River, is designed to have an installed capacity of 1.35
million kw. The power generating capacity is set to reach 5.9
billion kwh annually in its initial period of operation, and
eventually hit seven billion kwh a year.
</P>
<P>
With an investment of 8.9 billion yuan, the first generating
unit of the plant is scheduled to be operational in 2001. All the
six units are expected to be in full operation in 2003.
</P>
<P>
The site of the project, with a steep water drop and sparse
population, is ideal for such a large project.
</P>
<P>
The Dachaoshan Hydro-power Co. Ltd. was the sole developer and
future operator of the project, which is jointly funded by State
Development and Investment Corporation, Yunnan Hongta Industrial
Co. Ltd., Yunnan Electricity Corporation and Yunnan Development
and Investment Corporation,
</P>
<P>
Up to now, some 1.2 billion yuan has been allotted for the
preparation of the project. Water diversion tunnels, key to the
damming of the river, have been put in use since May of 1996.

<HEADLINE> Shareholding System A Lifesaver for China's State-Owned Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- A shareholding system is an
essential and feasible means of reforming the state-owned economy
and will lead to a breakthrough in the decade-long reform of
China's economic system.
</P>
<P>
This view is shared by Chinese economists and officials in an
ongoing media discussion.
</P>
<P>
They held that most of the large- and medium-sized state-owned
enterprises in China, which at present are solely state-owned, may
be transformed into shareholding companies in the future.
</P>
<P>
A shareholding system is an ideal way to realize public
ownership, according to some economists, and is needed to further
boost the Chinese economy, which is still in the primary stage of
socialism.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the State Commission for Restructuring the
Economy (SCRE) show that the 100 state-owned ventures selected to
try out the modern enterprise system through shareholding
transformation have seen their total assets grow 99.45 billion
yuan, or some 27.6 percent over 1994, to more than 360 billion
yuan at the end of last year -- a laudable accomplishment when
compared with the general inertia of the state sector.
</P>
<P>
At the root of the poor performance of state ventures is the
"state-ownership" of their assets -- an abstractly defined
practice which doesn't fall in step with the socialist market
economy.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, transforming these businesses into shareholding
companies will prove to be the wisest way to lead them out of
financial dilemma, said economist Wei Jie in a recent article in
China Securities.
</P>
<P>
Yang Qixian, vice-chairman of the Chinese Economy Restructuring
Research Society, echoed Wei's view by saying that a shareholding
economy will help create clear enterprise ownerships and prompt
the enterprises to be more market-oriented rather than responsive
only to government departments.
</P>
<P>
China piloted the practice of transforming state ventures into
shareholding companies in 1984. More enterprises joined the
program in 1991, but the number of shareholding companies which
evolved from former state ventures has hovered around 9,000 since
1995.
</P>
<P>
The shareholding system was unable to come into its own, since
people still tended to believe that sole state ownership was the
only way to establish public ownership.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin resolved the debate in late May in a
speech at the Party School of the CPC Central Committee, which is
said to have mapped out the course of state sector reform.
</P>
<P>
Jiang called for bold exploration of new ways to achieve public
ownership that may substantially boost the overall economy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country's top state economic officials also
showed increasing determination to transform the state-owned
enterprises into shareholding companies.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji stressed during an inspection tour of
the state-owned enterprises in northeastern Liaoning Province in July
that the Chinese stock market may become an important source of
funding for the state ventures, as it is gliding along a steady
and standardized development course.
</P>
<P>
The economists reached consensus on the relationship between a
shareholding system and public ownership, saying that changing
state-owned enterprises into shareholding companies only adjusts
the mangement mode of the state enterprises and has nothing to do
with privatization.
</P>
<P>
And some economists noted that a shareholding system could only
embolden instead of weakening the leading position of public
ownership in the Chinese economy, since it allows the state to
control a shareholding enterprise by holding 51 percent of its
stake, and will thereby increase the influence of the state assets
to a greater extent.

<HEADLINE> New Political Culture Established in Pakistan: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Information Minister
Mushahid Hussain Sayed said here today the government has
established corruption-free political culture and scandal-free
administration besides ensuring economic stability over the past
six months.
</P>
<P>
"Now there is a new socio-political environment in the country
and high-level political corruption has been virtually
eliminated," Mushahid said when briefing journalists on the six
months performance of the government led by Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif.
</P>
<P>
On the economic front, he said, the government has succeeded in
reviving the economy through indigenous policies within a short
span of six months.
</P>
<P>
The tax-free budget has led to an increase in foreign exchange
reserves from 300 million U.S. dollars to the current level of 1.5
billion dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
The information minister also said that legislation has
provided for structural changes to ensure political stability and
strengthening the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
The removal of Article 58(2) B of the Constitution, which had
empowered the President to dismiss an elected government, has
eliminated one of the basic causes of political instability since
1985, he said.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the anti-defection law has removed the possibility
of political opportunism which was one of the worst problems
affecting the Pakistani political culture, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The leaders of Libya, Burkina
Faso, Chad, Mali and Niger have called for redoubling efforts to
find solutions to some African issues, including development and
stability.
</P>
<P>
The leaders issued the call in their joint statement which was
issued at the close of their summit meeting Saturday night in the
Libyan capital of Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
The statement, which was published by Libya's news agency
JANA, underlined the necessity of enhancing the rapprochement
among African nations as a step toward achieving African unity.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that leaders of the five African states
commissioned their foreign ministers to hold a meeting in Tripoli
next month to consider this issue.
</P>
<P>
About Libya's dispute with some Western powers, the statement
said that leaders of the five African states expressed their
anxiety about the continuation of the U.N. sanctions imposed on
Libya, which have negative effects on Libya and the economies of
the five African states.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the five states also made an urgent appeal to
the international community to find a fair and ultimate solution
to Libya's dispute with both the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
They called on U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to send a
fact-finding commission to Libya to see how U.N. sanctions are
affecting the Libyan people.
</P>
<P>
Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 for refusing to
turn over two Libyans charged in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet
over Lockerbie, Scotland which killed 270 people.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nigerians Accused of Planting Land Mines in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The military government in
Sierra Leone today accused Nigerian troops based near the
capital's international airport of "planting land-mines" in the
area.
</P>
<P>
The troops have been based at the airport for the past two and
a half months after the May 25 coup which ousted the civilian
government of Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement broadcast on state radio, "a tank
belonging to the Nigerian army was blown up on Friday, killing at
least 15 Nigerian soldiers."
</P>
<P>
The tank, the radio said, ran over the mines by mistake and
detonated them which have been planted to trap or forestall
attacks from Sierra Leone soldiers stationed about two miles
away.
</P>
<P>
The radio also expressed "concern over the use of the airport
by Nigerian soldiers as a base to transfer hard drugs including
cocaine to Europe and South America."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, three Sierra Leone soldiers were seriously injured
on Saturday after their vehicle was shot at by Nigerian troops
manning a checkpoint at Jui, about 13 miles from the capital.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers, one corporal and two lance corporals, were among
a group of eight soldiers on their way to the military training
center at Benguema, 20 miles east of the capital.
</P>
<P>
They were taken to the Benguema military hospital for
emergency surgery and then flown to the capital by military
helicopter.
</P>
<P>
Interviewed at the hospital, the commanding officer at
Benguema, Anthony Kargbo accused the Nigerians of "itching for a
fight. This is a real provocation. Why should they halt our
vehicle to search for arms in our own land?"
</P>
<P>
This reporter drove some 200 yards from the military vehicle
and heard a volley of shots ring out in quick succession after a
Nigerian soldier ordered the car to stop to be searched for arms.
</P>
<P>
The car sped away and the shots shattered its rear windscreen.
</P>
<P>
The incident immediately brought dozens of heavily armed rebel
combatants and Sierra Leone soldiers out of their trenches about
a mile way from the Nigerian base.
</P>
<P>
They shouted in a frenzy mood, threatening to kill anybody as
they brandish their AK47s. There has not been any report of
clashes so far.

<HEADLINE> Lissouba Pays Surprise Visit to Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 17 (Xinhuaba) -- Congolese President Pascal
Lissouba crossed the Congo River Saturday to make a surprise
visit to Democratic Congo (K) and explained to President Laurent
Kabila why the exchange of shell fire between the two capitals
broke out.
</P>
<P>
A report from Kinshasa said Lissouba has blamed the initial
shelling from Brazzaville, over the river to Kinshasa, on his
predecessor and rival Denis Sassou Nguesso. A bloody conflict
between their rival forces has killed hundreds in Brazzaville
since June.
</P>
<P>
"We don't know where the shells came from," Kabila said on
state television late on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"I've just spoken about it with my counterpart. It seems that
they came from the other side, from Sassou Nguesso's fighters...
We're going to find out where they came from."
</P>
<P>
Speaking also on Kinshasa television, Lissouba accused Sassou
of recruiting African mercenaries to foment trouble.
</P>
<P>
"I promised Kabila to bring evidence that his opponents,
Rwandans who were responsible for the genocide in Rwanda, Ugandan
opponents as well as Central African Republic mutineers, are
being recruited by this man," Lissouba said after Saturday's
talks.
</P>
<P>
"I think he wants to set fire to and shed blood in central
Africa," Lissouba charged.
</P>
<P>
Presidential elections in Congo (B) were postponed because of
the fighting between the two would-be candidates.
</P>
<P>
Renewed fighting in Brazzaville has forced thousands of people
to flee the capital over the past week.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks have stalled in the Gabonese capital of
Libreville, but are expected to resume on Monday, diplomats were
quoted as having said.
</P>
<P>
Lissouba conceded that the talks were getting bogged down, and
suggested that the mediation efforts of U.N. special envoy
Mohamed Sahnoun might not be able to take them further.
</P>
<P>
However, he appealed for a regional solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has backed the idea of an African
peace-keeping force but wants a real end to hostilities before it
is sent in.
</P>
<P>
Lissouba also said he would ask neighboring central African
countries to provide monitors when the presidential election was
finally held.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Never Doubts China's Sincerity: Deputy PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has never doubted
China's sincerity to be friendly with its neighbors although major
powers in the West think that Beijing is building up its strength
to control Asia, Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim
said today.
</P>
<P>
Anwar made the statement when opening the eight-day Zheng He
Memorial Exhibition here today, which is jointly organized by the
Malaysian Chinese Cultural Society, MCA (Malaysian Chinese
Association) Cultural Bureau and Malaysia-China Friendship
Association.
</P>
<P>
Recounting Admiral Zheng He's historical journey to the region
some 500 years ago, Anwar said that although the admiral who
served during the Ming Dynasty had a large and strong armada,
China did not display even then any intention to conquer its
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese approach was far in contrast to those of major
powers from the West at the time like the Portuguese, Dutch,
Spanish, French and English who sent their armada to the region
with the sole intention of conquering small countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is an historical fact that Zheng He was certainly a greater
admiral with a more superior fleet ... coming to this region, the
Malay world and all over the world, to build relations and not
with the colonial arrogance but to build a lasting bond of
friendship," Anwar said.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian leader said the trade ties with China and the
spirit of friendship fostered during the time of Emperor Yong Le
and the Sultan of Melaka (Malacca) were greatly appreciated by
Malaysia to these days and would remain as long as both countries
continued to cherish the spirit of understanding and tolerance.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said these events which occurred between 1405 and 1433
were not given prominence by historical writers. Instead, he said,
they presented Christopher Columbus as a great sailor when in fact
his vessel only measured 90 by 30 feet compared with Admiral Zheng
He's 400 by 150 feet.
</P>
<P>
"He (Zheng He) was the most renowned Chinese admiral with the
biggest sailing fleet in the world and he was also a Muslim.
</P>
<P>
"The journey of Zheng He makes us understand our own history.
There is a need for a reconstruction of our own history based on
our own world view," Anwar said.
</P>
<P>
He said the present younger generation knew Columbus better
than Admiral Zheng He because the Malaysian and Asian history was
influenced by Eurocentrics.
</P>
<P>
This historical perspective should be corrected so that people
in the region could be proud of the achievements of Admiral Zheng
He who according to historical facts had visited more countries
than Columbus, he said.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition will also be held in Melaka (August 26-27),
Johor Bahru (August 29-30), Pulau Pinang (September 3-9), Alor
Setar (September 6-7) and Terengganu (September 9-10).

<HEADLINE> Israel Urged to Honor Agreements with Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Chief peace negotiator of the
Palestinian National Authority Saeb Erakat today called on Israel
to respect all agreements between the two sides on which the
Mideast peace march was based.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Voice of Arabs radio, the
Palestinian official said the peace process is "indivisible" and
the ball is now in the Israeli court.
</P>
<P>
He held Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responsible
for the current peace crisis, which began as Israel broke ground
for the building of a controversial Jewish settlement in
traditional Arab East Jerusalem, where the Palestinians want as
their future capital.
</P>
<P>
Erakat's statement concurred with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat's sounding demanded that the final settlement talks between
Israel and the Palestinians must run parallel to the
implementation of all agreements reached during the transitional
period.
</P>
<P>
On the possibility of resuming peace negotiations now that the
Palestinian-Israeli security coordination has been restored,
Erakat said there are still deep differences regarding security
issues.
</P>
<P>
The PNA said Friday it planned to match Israeli sanctions with
a selective and gradual boycott of Israeli goods. It also called
for national unity talks with opponents of Palestinian-Israeli
peace deals.
</P>
<P>
Arafat condemned as collective punishment Israeli sanctions and
its closure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip following the July 30
twin suicide bombing in Jerusalem, saying they would only weaken
the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's spokesman Marwan Kanfani met Friday night with
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa on Egypt's ongoing efforts to
revive the faltering Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation Friday, President Hosni Mubarak's
political advisor Osama el-Baz and Arafat reviewed the situation
in the region after U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross' mediation
between Israel and the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Generators Installed in China's Large Hydro-power Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, August 17 (Xinhua) -- A power generating unit with a
capacity of 550,000 kw was today installed in Ertan Hydro-power
Plant, China's second largest hydro-power project next to the
Three Gorges endeavor.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu Junfeng, general manager of Ertan Hydro-power
Development Corporation, the project, located in the middle
reaches of Yalong River in southwest China's Sichuan Province,
will sport six generating units with a combined capacity of 3.3
million kw. The plant is set to generate 17 billion kwh of
electricity annually after it becomes fully operational in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Liu said the newly installed unit, along with another one to be
installed later, were expected to be put in use next July.
</P>
<P>
Construction of a 240-meter-high dike is now underway. Upon
completion, the new 101-square-km reservoir is to hold 5.8 billion
cubic meters of water.
</P>
<P>
After operation of its first unit, Ertan is slated to transmit
electricity to the outside networks in October of 1998. "After
that, one unit will be put into production every four months," Liu
said.
</P>
<P>
The project is set to become one of the key energy supply bases
in southwest China upon its completion in 2000, lessening the
tight electricity supply in the region.
</P>
<P>
Liu also revealed that his company is to further tap the
abundant hydro-power resources in other parts of the Yalong
River. The preparatory studies on two new projects, with
respective designed capacities of 1.8 million kw and 440,000 kw,
are now underway.

LHASA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The local government in north
Tibet Autonomous Region will fund a 250 million yuan project
designed to help domestic animals survive the region's harsh
winters.
</P>
<P>
Grasslands in North Tibet are home to one third of Tibet's

year.
</P>
<P>
As part of the government effort to improve the well-being of
local Tibetans, the three-year project aims to build barns and
sheds to shelter the more than seven million animals in the region
from snowstorms and frigid temperatures.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Enact National Policy on AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government may enact
the national policy on acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)
before the end of the year, the Guardian reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said four technical committees had prepared the
draft policy in 1995, but the National Council on Health has
failed to enact it for twice.
</P>
<P>
With the recent death of AIDS complications of Fela
Anikulapo-Kuti, Nigeria's pop music star known as Afro-Beat King,
the report said, the government is beginning to pay top attention
to the matter.
</P>
<P>
It said Health Minister Ihechukwu Madubuke has summoned the
national AIDS Control Coordinator Nasir Sani-Gwarzo and other
health officials to a meeting in Abuja this week to put finishing
touches to the policy.
</P>
<P>
The policy in view will define the roles of various arms of
governments and non-governmental organizations in AIDS control.
</P>
<P>
It will give top priority to preventive strategies, including
compulsory blood screening before any blood transfusion.
</P>
<P>
While Fela is the first prominent Nigerian known to have died
of AIDS, the country's AIDS/HIV population is estimated to be as
high as two million, almost one-fifth of its total population.
</P>
<P>
Announcing his death on August 2, Fela's brother and former
Health Minister Olikoye Ransome-Kuti said they have decided to do
so so that the public and the government "will know it's a
serious issue."

<HEADLINE> Russia Airlines Asks for UN Approval to Fly to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian's Aeroflot airlines has
joined other world airline companies to seek the United Nations
Sanctions Committee's approval to fly medicines and medical
equipment to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Rabei Mohammed Saleh, director general of
the Iraqi Airways Co., quoted by local "Al-Jomhouria" newspaper
today.
</P>
<P>
A number of world airline companies - including German, French
Dutch, British, African and Arab ones - have made similar requests
to the U.N. for permission to carry food and medical supplies, as
well as sick and old-aged people from Iraq for treatment.
</P>
<P>
Saleh said his company has received from Russia's Aeroflot a
cable saying it has made such a request and is awaiting an
approval.
</P>
<P>
Iraq affirms that the U.N. Security Council resolutions imposed
after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait do not ban civilian and
humanitarian flights to and from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
It is also demanding the U.N. to allow its civilian aircraft
should to carry sick people abroad for better treatment.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi people have been suffering greatly from the
seven-year-old U.N. sanctions due to a constant shortage of food
and medicine.

<HEADLINE> Pivotals Slump on Bombay Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 17 (Xinhua) -- After a bullish spell,
pivotals slumped on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) market last
week mainly on heavy selling pressure following the reports that
the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) had deferred its
decision to review the carry-forward system.
</P>
<P>
The sensitive index that crossed the 4600 mark on Monday
dropped below the 4300 mark on Thursday on all-round selling
coupled with absence of institutional buying. The weekend rates
showed widespread losses. The trading volume dropped.
</P>
<P>
The BSE sensitive index, which spurted from the previous week
level of 4397.54 points to 4605.41 on Monday, crashed on increased
selling pressure to finish at 4320.97 with a net loss of 76.57
points.
</P>
<P>
The national index also declined from the best level of 2007.06
points to finish at 1879.22 against the previous week's level of
1914.02.
</P>
<P>
Pivotals suffered further following sustained selling pressure
by speculators due to end account considerations and the long
weekend holidays. The sharp fall was also due to the absence of
foreign institutional investors and the low activity of domestic
funds that affected the market sentiment.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Plans to Launch Islamic Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The mufti of Egypt, Sheikh Nasr
Farid Wassel, said his country is planning to launch an "Islamic
satellite" to determine with precision the Muslim lunar calendar,
the Middle East Times reported in its lastest edition.
</P>
<P>
"Studies are under way to launch in space an Egyptian Islamic
satellite to determine the start of the Muslim months," the
Egyptian weekly quoted Sheikh Wassel as saying.
</P>
<P>
"This will help put an end to disagreements which have arisen
between Arab and Islamic countries over the start of the Muslim
months," he said.
</P>
<P>
The start of the Islamic months, such as the holy month of
Ramadan, when Muslims fast from dawn to dusk, is decided by the
sighting of the new moon; and Muslim states often observe
different dates for the start of these months for lack of
consensus.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim month starts the day after the crescent is spotted
with the naked eye.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Wassel said the satellite in the space would transmit to
earth pictures that would be used to determine without doubt the
new moon, which otherwise is often difficult to see because of
"natural obstacles" such as clouds.
</P>
<P>
The mufti, who is entrusted by the government to issue
religious decrees and set the start of Muslim months, said he
hoped the new satellite would be launched before Ramadan, which
should start around 31 December this year.
</P>
<P>
Appeals for donations to help finance this project, which will
cost less than 2 million U.S. dollars, will be made soon, he said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is expected to launch its first information and
telecommunication satellite, Nilesat, next year with the help of
France.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Interior Minister Sues Paper for Slander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Interior Minister Hassan
Al-Alfi filed a libel suit Saturday against an opposition newspaper
that accused him of corruption and abuse of power, Cairo dailies
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Alfi challenged the newspaper Al Shaab to publish documents
backing up its charges that he and his associates are corrupt and
have abused their power.
</P>
<P>
It is the second case filed by Egypt's senior officials
recently against the press for slander. President Hosni Mubarak's
two sons brought a Saudi paper to court last month for publishing
a "defamatory" story of their business dealings.
</P>
<P>
Alfi told reporters earlier that "the campaign isn't the first
(against him) but the affair is dangerous because this newspaper
is the organ of the Muslim Brothers and the terrorists."
</P>
<P>
"Everything that is printed in this newspaper is a lie, and I
challenge the newspaper to publish a single document in support
(of its accusations)," he said.
</P>
<P>
Al Shaab has been accusing Alfi and some of his associates of
racketeering, nepotism and involvement in a high-profile
corruption case for about three weeks.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper, which appears twice a week, "publishes
tendentious rumors with the goal of demoralizing the police after
their success against terrorism," he said.
</P>
<P>
Alfi's Interior Ministry is fighting a war against Islamic
militants that have staged a violent campaign since 1992 to
overthrow Egypt's incumbent secular government.

<HEADLINE> Iran Accuses US of Dumping Nuclear Waste in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 17 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian naval commander has
accused the United States of threatening the lives of the people
in the region by dumping its nuclear waste in Saudi Arabia and
United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily Salam today quoted Admiral Ashkbous
Daneh-Kar as saying that "our investigation shows that the U.S. is
dumping plenty of its nuclear waste in Saudi Arabia's desert and
the UAE."
</P>
<P>
"Both in the short-term and the long-term, this is
endangering the lives of the people in the region," he added.
</P>
<P>
The commander also charged that the U.S. Fifth Fleet in the
Persian Gulf posed a constant threat to the environment.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. Fifth Fleet is equipped with nuclear reactors. If
these reactors are damaged, an incident with the magnitude of
(the accident at Chernobl) power plant will occur," he warned.
</P>
<P>
He accused the U.S. forces of having used ammunition that
contained uranium in their military maneuvers in the Persian
Gulf.
</P>
<P>
"Based on our research and investigation, the U.S. has used
shells that have contained uranium in its military maneuvers in
the Persian Gulf," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian military officer further charged that "noise,
heat and nuclear pollution" created by the U.S. forces were
responsible for the death of dolphins and sharks whose corpses
have been washed ashore on Iranian coastal areas and
islands.

<HEADLINE> "Parent School" for Juvenile Delinquents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, August 17 (Xinhua) -- A court in Fushun, a city in
northeast China, has helped juvenile delinquents break away with
their criminal past in a very special and successful way --
offering schooling for their parents.
</P>
<P>
In the district where is the court, more than 70 percent of the
juvenile cases handled by the city's Xinfu District People's Court
are considered related with family factors.
</P>
<P>
Since the opening of the "parent school" five years ago, all
the offenders sentenced by the court in the 264 juvenile cases
have "absolutely and completely broken away with" their criminal
past, according to court sources.
</P>
<P>
In addition to judges, the school invites people from the labor
union, the women's association, as well as senior educators, to
give lectures to the parents of the juvenile offenders.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 parents have attended such classes in the school
over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
"The court has not only educated my son, but also us," said
farmer Zhang, father of a juvenile offender. "It is as well our
lack of legal and educational knowledge that has made our child a
criminal," he said.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the reoccurrence of juvenile offences, the school
has extended its education coverage to local elementary and middle
schools, teaching parents in general the importance of legal
knowledge.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Celebrates 52nd Independence Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia today held a grand
ceremony to celebrate the 52nd anniversary of its independence
from centuries of Dutch colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,000 people including government ministers and
high-ranking officials, army chiefs and officers, diplomats,
veteran fighters and other guests attended the ceremony at the
Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony opened with the booming of field guns at 10:00
a.m. (local time), just the same time on August 17, 1945 when
Indonesia's first president Sukarno proclaimed the country's
independence.
</P>
<P>
The formal transfer of power from the Dutch, who had ruled
Indonesia for more than 350 years before three years of Japanese
occupation during the second world war, came only in 1949 after
intermittent and some heavy fighting between colonial troops and
the guerrillas led by Sukarno.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Indonesians were killed between 1945 and
1949 in fighting to oust the Dutch occupants.
</P>
<P>
After a flag-hosting ceremony, House Speaker Wahono re-read the
text of the independence proclamation.
</P>
<P>
In his state address Saturday at the parliament to mark the
independence anniversary, President Soeharto called on the whole
nation to pay respect to the sacrifices of the national heroes.
</P>
<P>
The president also urged the Indonesian people to work harder
so as to catch up with the progress made by neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
He called on the people to continue preserving the fighting
spirit and the spirit of nationalists and unity.
</P>
<P>
The president said Indonesia has made remarkable achievements
in its economic construction in the past two decades with an
average annual economic growth of 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Indonesia's per capita income reached 1,155 U.S.
dollars, 16 times higher than the figure in 1969, he added.

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Attracts Growing Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chongqing, August 17 (Xinhua) -- A rapidly increasing number of
people are flocking to the Three Gorges areas along the Yangtze
River to marvel at the natural wonder -- before the river is
dammed up by the year end as part of a multi-million construction
project.
</P>
<P>
Some 114,000 people from home and abroad toured the area
between January and June this year, a figure representing a 38
percent rise over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
While tourism companies report booming business, enthusiastic
tourists, however, are frustrated by the difficulty in securing
seats at touring ships.
</P>
<P>
As the peak season usually comes in September and October, the
number of tourists to the Three-Gorge region is expected to hit a
record high this year, according to the industry's analysis.
</P>
<P>
One reason for the increase is the fear that the dam-up of the
river in the region within the year might more or less damage the
Three-Gorges' natural beauty.
</P>
<P>
Tourism authorities have worked hard to dispel such ungrounded
anticipation, assuring repeatedly that with good preservation,
tourists will enjoy no less of nature's beauty, but more of
quality service.

<HEADLINE> Land Protection in Tibet Yields Positive Result </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The increase has come around as a result of sustained land and
forestry protection efforts of the goverment of the Tibet
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Though the region boasts a total land area of over 1.2 million
square kilometers, utility rate of land resources remains low,
largely due to a number of geographical reasons, including a high
altitude, unfavorable topography and geology, and a harsh climate.
</P>
<P>
With a policy for scientific urban planning, the regional land
administrative authorities have placed strict control on the scale
of cities and towns and are very stringent on approving land for
capital construction.
</P>
<P>
Also, the local authorities set up protection zones in 22 major
grain producing counties in the region, as a way to implement a
regulations for farm land in the region.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the region launched a land reclaiming program and
successfully added some 2,000 hectares to local arable land
acreage, with the first years's crop yields sufficiently feeding
people living on the previously gravel-ridden unproductive land.
</P>
<P>
The region is pushing ahead with the reclaiming program in a
hope to lift more people out of poverty with an increasing farm
land acreage.

<HEADLINE> Lusaka Fire Officer Suspended For Malfeasance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Lusaka City Council chief fire
officer Stevenson Njobvu has been suspended indefinitely for last
week's fires which gutted the cabinet office and the old Soweto
market.
</P>
<P>
The fire department is severely handicapped by lack of
equipment to tackle any major disaster, Sunday Times reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The local paper also said major cities of the country are not
equipped to tackle plane crashes, natural calamities and fires.
</P>
<P>
The riot rocked the capital Lusaka last Wednesday after
mysterious fires ruined the markets.
</P>
<P>
The riot and the fires exposed the grave situation facing the
department and the fire chief's suspension is part of a catalogue
of woes dogging the fire brigade.
</P>
<P>
The decision to suspend Njobvu was made two days after the
riot, which was triggered off by the fire gutting the Soweto
market last Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The clashes between the police and the marketeers led to two
deaths and arrest of about 70 protesters.
</P>
<P>
After the fire incident at the cabinet office, President
Frederick Chiluba took a swipe at the government failure to bring
in two fire engines donated by Japan a long time ago, which are
still in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said the fire should serve as a lesson to the lax
government officials.

<HEADLINE> Italy Beat Japan in World Volleyball Grand Prix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 17 (Xinhua) -- An Italian women's volleyball
team won a historical match over Japan at the three-day Hong Kong
leg of the World Women's Volleyball Grand Prix here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Italy won the match 15-2, 15-10, 15-6. It was their first ever
victory over Japan in any official competition.
</P>
<P>
The Italians seemed fairly easy when they took the match in
only 50 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Almost all the three went Italian way except for the second
during which the Japanese built a better defense mainly through
the back-row players. But the chance soon elipsed as the Italians
launnched more fierce attacks.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very, very happy for today's victory over Japan. It is
very important to Italy. Italy has a very good men's team but our
women's team was less impressive," said Italian head coach Julio
Velasco.
</P>
<P>
He recalled Italy's to Japan during the Olympic qualifying
tournament in Osaka, Japan, in April last year. "We lost 15-0 in
one of the sets. You could well see how we've improved ever
since," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We'd been very difficult in Macao where we had to play such
strong sides like China and Russia. But we had one day for
training after arriving here, which was important for us," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Italian coach did not think their victory over China here
yesterday meant a lot. It was only something sychological, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"World-class teams like China, Cuba and Russia are teachers in
women's volleyball. To play our teachers give our players special
strength," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese did not play well yesterday. They should have
done better," he added.
</P>
<P>
Japanese head coach Nobuchika Kuzuwa thought poor reeicing had
cost his team's chances today. "We had many problems in
receiving, which prevent them from playing to their form," he said.
</P>
<P>
There were many young and unexperienced players in the team,
who could not play cosistently during hard matches.
</P>
<P>
"I hope they could improve in a period of time, say one year,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he did not think his players would be much
affected by today's defeat. "I hope they could be confident enough
to face Italy in the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
When asked how long he thought Japan would need before
recovering to the world-class caliber as during the 60s and 70s,
he said that could be very long. "There are so many strong teams
in the world and we really lag too much behind," he admitted.
</P>
<P>
China is playig Cuba in the second match of the day and the
final one of the three-day tournament here.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's IFP Resumes Peace Talks with ANC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Inkatha Freedom Party
(IFP), the biggest black opposition party in South Africa, has
said it will resume peace talks with ruling African National
Congress after suspending negotiations more than one week ago.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made at the weekend by IFP National
Chairman Ben Ngubane during a break in the National Council
meeting in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
IFP suspended peace talks with ANC on August 7 when it claimed
that the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) was biased
against the IFP.
</P>
<P>
TRC is a fact-finding group, which is authorized by the
government to investigate violent activities during the apartheid
era. It is also responsible for studying and approving amnesty
applications from the offenders.
</P>
<P>
The IFP's withdrawal from peace talks with ANC was sparked by
revelations to the TRC hearing in Durban by former Kwazulu Natal
Province Police Death Squad operatives, who implicated a number
of senior IFP leaders in planning political assassinations during
the late 1980s and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
IFP leaders initially said it would resume peace talks only
once an alternative to the TRC was created for Kwazulu Natal
Province.
</P>
<P>
Local press today quoted informed sources as saying that
rising pressure from business in the province and a perceived
loss of investor confidence had forced the IFP to rethink.
</P>
<P>
The ANC has expressed welcome to the IFP's return to the
reconciliation process. ANC negotiator S'bu Ndebele said it was
crucial that the "fundamentals of peace and democracy were not
undermined by differences between the two parties.

<HEADLINE> Kafelnikov to Face Rafter in New Haven Tennis Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Yevgeny Kafelnikov
of Russia defeated former champion Petr Korda 6-4, 7-6 (7-4)
Saturday for a final showdown against Australian Patrick Rafter at
the Pilot Pen tennis tournament in New Haven on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Rafter, the eighth seed, overcame the booming serves of
Britain's Greg Rusedski 7-5, 4-6, 6-3 in another semi-final match
of the day.
</P>
<P>
There was only one service break in the Kafelnikov-Korda match,
that coming in the very first game when the Czech double faulted
on the final point.
</P>
<P>
The match was basically a baseline duel with Korda, the
lefthander from the Czech Republic who was the titleholder in the
event in 1991, often in trouble because of unforced errors. He
double faulted nine times. Kafelnikov had no double faults.
</P>
<P>
Kafelnikov, who had come into the match with a 5-2 record
against Korda, was down set point for the only time at 5-6 in the
second set, but eventually took the game to force the tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
In the breaker, Korda started with a double fault but pulled
even at 3-3 before backcourt errors cost him the match. Down 5-4,
Korda hit one return long, then hit one into the net to end the
match.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Set up Bank to Promote Small Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Nepal is preparing to set up a
Small and Cottage Industries Development Bank to promote the
country's backbone industries, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Together with some 500 entrepreneurs, the Nepal Rastra Bank,
the country's central bank, have made arrangements for the
investment capital of 81.6 million rupees (1.43 million U.S.
dollars) needed for establishing the proposed bank, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Of the paid-up capital of 160 million rupees (2.8 million
dollars) with the bank, which will have an authorized investment
capital of 640 million rupees (11.2 million dollars) and issued
capital of 320 million rupees (5.6 million dollars), 51 percent
will be collected from the promoters, 34 percent from the general
public, 10 percent from entrepreneurs and the remainder from the
bank employees, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
President of the proposed bank Chandra Man Shrestha stressed
the importance of setting up such a bank, saying until recently
the small and cottage enterprises in Nepal have not been able to
spring up due to the lack of capital.
</P>
<P>
Half of the 97,000 such enterprises are in a state of
bankruptcy due to lack of operating capital and market, Shrestha
said.
</P>
<P>
The bank, once established, will set up small-scale industrial
estate and provide collateral-free loans to entrepreneurs to set
up cottage and small enterprises.
</P>
<P>
And it will mobilize the necessary means and resources for
setting up such enterprises in areas where small and cottage
industrial zones have not been created, the president said.
</P>
<P>
The bank also plans to implement a woman entrepreneurs program,
said the president.
</P>
<P>
Nepal Small and Cottage Industries Federation has set up women
entrepreneurship associations in 18 districts across the country
and have started skill development programs there.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Development Program is said to be interested
in working in such programs in association with the Small and
Cottage Industries Development Bank, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> New Thai Deputy PM Outlines His Priorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Virabongsa Ramangura, the newly
appointed deputy prime minister, sees the next three months as
"most critical" for the ailing Thai economy, local newspaper "the
Nation"
reported today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with a group of Thai reporters, Uirabongsa, a
former finance minister, who joined the government last Friday to
oversee financial and monetary matters, said, 'if I can make any
contribution by pushing the country one step back from teetering
off the edge of the cliff, I'll consider myself as having
accomplished enormous task."
</P>
<P>
He pledged to tackle the non-performing loans in the finance
sector, shrink the current account deficit and stabilize the
foreign exchange reserves as his top priorities in restoring
macroeconomic confidence.
</P>
<P>
Shrinking the economy to a level supported by domestic savings
and managing foreign exchange reserves are also his priorities in
an attempt to bring the macroeconomic imbalances under control.
</P>
<P>
Virabongsa, who is seen as a conservative economist, was one of
those who masterminded the baht devaluation in 1984.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that he is not a white knight who can improve
things overnight since the economic malaise is so serious that it
will take at least three years before Thais can hope to see it
take off again.
</P>
<P>
He said, 'i don't know as yet what is going to happen from now
on. But i am certain that next year things are going to get
worse.'
</P>
<P>
Local media say Thailand's economy is now at the weakest point
since the 1960s, resulting from overheated building industry,
export slowdown, non-performing loans, huge external debt burden,
high current account deficit and high import.

country, the sources noted.
</P>

They added due to the loss of pilots during the recent past
there is a death of pilots in the Air force and it is their plan

<HEADLINE> Chittagong Port Imposes Congestion Surcharge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's biggest seaport
Chittagong Port imposed a temporary congestion surcharge for one
month following unsuccessful talks between port authorities and
feeder vessels operators in Singapore, port sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore-based Chittagong Feeder Trade Committee (CFTC)
has imposed the surcharge from Saturday. The surcharge was fixed
at the rate of 150 U.S. dollars for a 20-foot container and 300
dollars for a 40-foot container per day.
</P>
<P>
According to the port sources, the port will incur a loss of
several millions of dollars due to imposition of the congestion
surcharge, which will also cause a serious hindrance to the
country's foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
The CFTC last month decided to impose the surcharge on the plea
that the Chittagong Port suffered in July a heavy congestion due
mainly to a strike by trade union bodies, heavy rainfall and
shortage of space.
</P>
<P>
A delegation from Bangladesh comprising port users and
officials held several round of talks with CFTC representatives on
Thursday, seeking a reprieve from the surcharge.
</P>
<P>
The CFTC declined to reduce the surcharge, however, it gave a
deadline of one month to remove the congestion from the port. It
would withdraw the surcharge if the port authorities could ensure
a congestion-free port within the deadline of one month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at the Chittagong Port, congestion caused by the
containers was reduced considerably as the port authorities and
other relative bodies of the government took special arrangements
to tackle the problem.
</P>
<P>
The Customs, the port and the banks are working round the clock
for the last one month to remove the congestion at the port, said
the port sources.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore-based feeder operators had imposed congestion
surcharge off and on from 1992 as a result of shortage of
container handling equipment and space in container yards and
unusual strikes.
</P>
<P>
The CFIT's latest congestion surcharge was imposed in September
1995, but was lifted on July 1, 1996.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Probes Suspected Helicopter Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan police is
investigating whether a group of Sri Lankan millionaire
businessmen were trying to purchase eight MI-24 helicopters for
the Tamil rebels who are fighting with government troops, police
sources here said today.
</P>
<P>
Three businessmen were arrested by the police and have been
remanded till August 20, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Investigations made by detectives reportedly revealed that a
Sri Lankan businessman had arrived in the Ukraine to place an
order for the purchase of eight MI helicopters, they said.
</P>
<P>
Since there was no such order from the Ministry of Defense or
the Sri Lankan Air Force in Colombo, it was suspected that the
clandestine purchase was being made for the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
The sources added that investigations also revealed that the
group of three businessmen were to receive the equivalent of 1
million U.S. dollars as commissions for each helicopter from the
suppliers.

<P>
NEW DELHI, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Andhra Pradesh Governor
Krishan Kant was elected vice-president of India here Saturday
evening by members of both houses of parliament and he is expected
to be sworn in on August 21.
</P>
<P>
Krishan Kant, 70, was born on February 28, 1927, at Kot
Mohammed Khan village in Amritar District of Punjab in
northwestern India in a family of freedom fighters. He took an
active part in the Quit India Movement of 1942 when he was a
student in Lahore (now in Pakistan) and was arrested along with
members of his family. His father, Lala Achint Ram, was a member
of the Constituent Assembly and later a member of parliament.
</P>
<P>
He began his political career as a member of the Congress and
later was expelled from the Congress for opposing the infamous
emergency declared by Indira Gandhi in 1975. With former prime
minister Chandra Shekhar and Mohan Dharia, he had formed the
celebrated group of "Young Turks" and often espoused causes which
were not always to the liking of the party leadership.
</P>
<P>
He was the first to raise the question of criminalisation of
politics and he is strongly against corruption in the country.
</P>
<P>
Krishan Kant is a childhood friend of Prime Minister Inder
Kumar Gujral. Both went to school and college together and
participated in the freedom struggle as student leaders.

<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- An education program designated
to help children in China's poor areas, launched by the World
Bank, had financed 25,400 children and built 94 schools in
northwest China's Qinghai Province since 1996.
</P>
<P>
The program, with 100 million US dollars in loans, targets
children in China's 124 poorest counties in seven provinces.
</P>
<P>
The sum for Qinghai totals eight million US dollars, according
to local officials. The provincial government has allocated 33.2
million yuan (about 4.15 million US dollars) to support the
program.
</P>
<P>
The money provided thus far has been used to build 94 schools,
train 1,600 educational personnel, and buy 15,000 desks and
chairs. An additional 73 schools are expected to be created in
1997.
</P>
<P>
When the program ends in 2001, the enrollment rate of children
at school age is expected to stand at 71.2 percent, compared to
the present 57.8 percent in the province, officials revealed.

<HEADLINE> Human Rights Groups to Watch Court Case Involving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Observers from two
international human rights groups will be present to monitor
Monday's court case between opposition Workers' Party chief J.B.
Jeyaretnam and 11 ruling People's Action Party (PAP) leaders,
including Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew, the Straits Times reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that International Commission of Jurists and
Amnesty International are sending representatives to the hearing
scheduled to last 12 days.
</P>
<P>
Jeyaretnam is now facing eight lawsuits for the remarks he made
at a Workers' Party election campaign rally on January 1, this
year, the eve of polling day in the last general election.
</P>
<P>
He told the rally that his Workers' Party team-mate in the
Cheng San Group Representative Constituency (GRC), lawyer Tang
Liang Hong, had just placed before him two reports the latter made
to the police against Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and his team.
</P>
<P>
The PAP leaders, including Prime Minister Goh and Senior
Minister Lee, are claiming that the words Jeyaretnam used implied
that they had conspired to commit criminal defamation against Mr.
Tang by labeling him an anti-Christian, anti-English educated
Chinese chauvinist.
</P>
<P>
The Straits Times said that a spokesman for the Ministry of
Information and the Arts, when asked to comment on the presence of
these observers, said on Saturday that the Ministry hopes "they
will stay and monitor carefully the case from beginning to end and
give a faithful report of how the rule of law is upheld in
Singapore."
</P>
<P>
The Times of London had reported last Wednesday that senior
legal observers from Australia and Mr. Paul Bentley, an Ontario
judge representing Amnesty International, would be in the gallery.
</P>
<P>
Jeyaretnam, who is represented by Queen's Counsel George
Carman, was quoted as saying that Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew,
one of the PAP leaders suing Jeyaretnam, was "terrified of being
questioned by Mr. Carman."
</P>
<P>
Responding to this, Lee Kuan Yew's press secretary Madam Yeong
Yoon Ying said, according to the Straits Times report, "Mr. Lee is
always a little nervous when he goes to court. After reading of
Mr. Carman's formidable reputation as a terrifying cross-examiner,
Mr. Lee is anxious not to let down his own counsel. Mr. Lee does
not have a Queen's Counsel. But he has been reassured by his
Senior Counsel Davinder Singh that answering questions truthfully
will be good enough."
</P>
<P>
An Amnesty International statement said last Friday that it
would monitor the hearing as it was concerned over reports that
the Singapore Government used civil defamation suits against
political opponents.

<HEADLINE> Inspection To Improve Accounting Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- China's national accounting
association said it wants to remould the country's 6,700
accounting firms into a team of "economic policemen".
</P>
<P>
By the end of the campaign, which began this month and ends in
1998, accounting firms are expected to enhance their quality to
play their role more properly and effectively in economic
activities which need their participation, today's "China Daily"
quoted Ding Pingzhun as saying, who is secretary-general of the
Chinese Institute of Certified Public Accountants (CICPA).
</P>
<P>
Accounting firms are required to conduct self-inspection before
CICPA's provincial branches and CICPA itself will inspect the
firms next year.
</P>
<P>
Firms which do not meet standards or break rules will be
stripped of licenses or be ordered to improve, Ding said.
</P>
<P>
He said the most urgent demand for improvement of Chinese CPAs
comes from the stock market, where some irregular or fraudulent
auditing reports have lead to confusion among investors and have
constituted malpractice by some listed companies.
</P>
<P>
China's stock market, with over 600 listed companies at
present, is expanding very fast.
</P>
<P>
The significance for the accounting industry's improvement is
underscored by the central government's decision that accounting
reports of all big State enterprises must be audited by CPAs.
</P>
<P>
Ding said one of the major goals of the industry overhaul is to
sever accounting firms' connections with government agencies or
other enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Under the control of government offices, it is impossible for
the accounting firms to be independent.

<HEADLINE> Boon or Bane of Nation's Economy? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- There are two diametrically
different opinions in China towards the use of foreign direct
investment (FDI): One favors it, the other disfavors it.
</P>
<P>
People against FDI argue it could crush the national industry
or economic autonomy. But some of these opinions have gone beyond
the pure economic sense, according to an article carried on
today's Business Weekly of China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Those skeptical people fear that foreign investors attempt to
monopolize technology. In other words, China has yet to import
state-of-the-art technology from foreign partners, Liu Su from the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, noted in the
second of a series of articles to clear fears about FDI in China.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors squeeze domestic counterparts out of the
market, and state assets are lost as they are under-valued in
forming joint ventures with foreign partners, according to the
skepticists.
</P>
<P>
Hence they propose that there should be a limit to FDI, of
which China has had enough, the article said.
</P>
<P>
If exports go well, China should import more technology and
equipment mainly with export income instead of FDI.
</P>
<P>
They also suggest that China should prefer foreign loans to FDI
to avert possible threats to economic autonomy, Liu observed.
</P>
<P>
China should encourage smaller investors and discourage larger
ones, like trans-national companies which may harm Chinese
national industry and economic safety, the skepticists say.
</P>
<P>
However, people who favor FDI argue that with increased
international division of labor, globalization has come to mark
the world economy. There's no 100 percent "national" industry
independent of the global community.
</P>
<P>
Any policy based on "national industry" in a narrow sense will
thus erode or erase national economic growth.
</P>
<P>
They say that foreign-funded firms should not be viewed as
enemies of the national economy. At present, China's mainland
investors hold 30 percent of joint venture capital. Of the capital
held by overseas investors, 60 percent are from Hong Kong, Taiwan
and Macao.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary and amenable to use FDI in sectors such as
automobiles and aircraft, where China lacks advanced technologies
for quick development, they add.
</P>
<P>
Poor management is the main reason why State assets are lost,
they point out, saying that FDI is not to blame for the market
failure of some domestic brands.

<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Recent snowfalls in the southern
mountain ranges of Peru have left eight children dead and some
20,000 inhabitants stranded, the authorities said today.
</P>
<P>
A total of 19 towns in the high Andean zones of the department
of Arequipa were isolated by snow and urgent aid was needed,
Cailloma Mayor Carlos Pichas told a local radio station.
</P>
<P>
"Snow has been falling since August 7, leaving a deep mantle
over the roads, and we cannot communicate or travel, and many
children are in peril and assistance is needed urgently," said the
mayor.
</P>
<P>
Domestic animals were dying in their stalls because the grass
was covered by ice and snow, said inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
The mayor requested blankets and medicines for the affected
population.
</P>
<P>
Pichas asked the air force to bring in the aid by helicopters
and to fly over the zone to evaluate the situation of these
townships.
</P>
<P>
The Ayacucho department, which lies northeast of Arequipa, is
also affected. In the department, hundreds of lams have died
because of the cold and lack of fodder.

<HEADLINE> Economist: 1997 Inflation Less Than 2% </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- China should take advantage of a
low inflation rate to accelerate economic restructuring, a senior
official said last week.
</P>
<P>
National retail prices inched up 1.6 percent between January
and July, the lowest since the mid-1980s, said today's Business
Weekly of China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Qiu Xiaohua, chief economist and spokesman of the State
Statistics Bureau (SSB), predicted the year-end inflation rate at
less than two percent, far below the projected six percent.
</P>
<P>
"We should take this rare opportunity to speed up the reform of
State-owned firms, the housing system, as well as investment and
price structures," Qiu noted.
</P>
<P>
State-owned firms face less pressure to pare their redundant
labor force during periods of low inflation, he explained.
</P>
<P>
A low inflation rate also forces manufacturers to cut prices to
survive fierce market competition, hence a need for them to change
their unprofitable production mix.
</P>
<P>
As for housing reform, Qiu said it is amenable to raise both
employees' salaries and housing rents, while increasing bank loans
to enhance the public's home-purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
Qiu said accelerated housing reform would help recoup nearly
100 billion yuan ($12 billion) locked in 50 million sq.m. of
unsold apartments across the country.
</P>
<P>
Other infrastructures like high ways and water conservancy
projects for agriculture could also get more input, he added.
</P>
<P>
China's inflation rate soared to 21.7 percent in 1994 but
continued decreasing until now.
</P>
<P>
Qiu suggested the government focus more on stabilizing than on
simply cutting prices.
</P>
<P>
The current low inflation is a natural result of a transition
from an overheated economy to a moderate one. "It's remarkable for
China to bring down its double-digit inflation rate to 1.6 percent
in only three years, " Qiu noted.

<HEADLINE> Deficits to be Cut by $1.2 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 17 (Xinhua) -- China is likely to slash
deficits by nearly 10 billion yuan ($1.2 billion) this fiscal
year, according to a report from the State Information Center
(SIC).
</P>
<P>
The forecast would bring hope to financial authorities, who are
striving to "invigorate China's financial situation" and balance
revenue and expenditures by the end of the century, said today's
Business Weekly of China Daily.
</P>
<P>
However, some experts believed the extra expenditures might
offset the increase in the fiscal incomes.
</P>
<P>
The SIC report estimated that this year's fiscal revenue would
grow 17 percent to 861.9 billion yuan ($103.8 billion).
</P>
<P>
Fiscal spending would rise 14.7 percent to 907.4 billion yuan
($109 billion), cutting total deficits to 45.5 billion yuan ($5.48
billion) from the present 57 billion yuan ($6.8 billion ).
</P>
<P>
The ratio of fiscal revenue to GDP is expected to crawl from
11.3 percent to 11.6 percent, the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, Su Ming, deputy director of the Research Institute of
Fiscal Science under the Ministry of Finance, predicted that the
central government still faces an uphill battle to balance the
fiscal income and spending by 2000.
</P>
<P>
He urged the financial authorities to tighten control over tax
collection and strengthen the central government's power in
manoeuvring the available money resources.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance announced last month that fiscal
revenue grew 29.9 percent in the first half of the year, reaching
390.1 billion yuan ($47 billion).
</P>
<P>
Expenditures rose 21.1 percent to 351.2 billion yuan ($42.3
billion), resulting in a surplus of 38.8 billion yuan ($4.6
billion).
</P>
<P>
The SIC report said that the increase of the stamp tax for
stock trading, personal income tax revenue and customs duties has
contributed to the growth of fiscal revenue. Meanwhile, some
State-owned enterprises witnessed better performance in the first
half of the year, generating more income taxes and less
governmental subsidies to money-losing firms.

<HEADLINE> Berger: Regular High-Level Exchanges With China Important </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. National Security
Advisor Samuel Berger said here today that it is extremely
important for the U.S. to have regular high-level talks with
Chinese leaders.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's extremely important that we have regular
high-level exchanges with the Chinese leadership and the American
leadership," he told CNN's Evans &AMP; Novak program.
</P>
<P>
Berger returned earlier this week from a three-day trip to
China to prepare for a landmark visit of Chinese President Jiang
Zemin to Washington this fall.
</P>
<P>
Berger said the United States has to engage with China rather
than contain it.
</P>
<P>
"This (China) is a quarter of the world's people. This is an
enormous country. And how they develop, what direction they take,
has an enormous impact on the next generation. And so we have to
engage with them."
</P>
<P>
"We have enormous stake in the direction in which China
evolves," he added.
</P>
<P>
Berger, who met Jiang and other senior Chinese officials
during his trip, believed that the U.S. and China have common
interests in the Korean Peninsula, Cambodia and arms control. In
these areas "we can work together," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He recognized that the two countries still disagree on human
rights, trade and weapons sales.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that the human rights issue is not the
only issue in the relationship. "There are broad interests here,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"So having engagement ... means a vehicle for trying to expand
cooperation and deal with problems," he said.
</P>
<P>
Berger is seen as a fast-rising star in President Bill
Clinton's plan for a second-term legacy of success on the
international stage.

<HEADLINE> Chile Asks U.S. Fairness in Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Chilean Defense Minister
Edmundo Perez Yoma said the United States policy for South America
must be the same for all the countries.
</P>
<P>
The minister told "El Mercurio" in an exclusive interview
published today that Chile has not requested any special privilege
over other countries of the region because it considers that must
not be done.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said last Wednesday
that Washington would likely choose Argentina as its close
military ally outside the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO), adding that the status is open to other countries,
including Chile.
</P>
<P>
Perez said that it is not convenient to establish differences
in the southern half of South America, which has known how to
solve its historical conflicts and preserved the peace for almost
one century.
</P>
<P>
He said the present situation does not affect the relations
between Chile and Argentina, and that "what we want with Argentina
is to continue on the same road we started."
</P>
<P>
"We want to deepen our relations and believe that it would be
good to analyze these measures together."
</P>
<P>
Diplomats in Washington said the granting of the status to
Argentina is expected to be announced by U.S. President Bill
Clinton when he visits Argentina in October.
</P>
<P>
Under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, the U.S. president
has the right to designate close military allies, a status that
does not require U.S. help in case of attacks, but allows the
allies to buy excess weapons from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Countries already designated as close non-NATO U.S. allies are
Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Japan and South Korea.

CARACAS, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's international
reserves increased 12.9 percent in five days from August 7 to 11,
the Central Bank announced.

In the five days, the reserves grew more than 2 billion
U.S. dollars from 16.34 billion to 18.5 billion, said the Central
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The quick increase was partly attributed to the rise of oil
income. The oil price rose more than two dollars per barrel in the
international market.
</P>

an adjustment plan and attractive interest rates helped build

STOCKHOLM, August 16 (Xinhua) -- A poll commissioned by the
Stockholm Olympic Bidding Committee showed that Swedish opposition
to Stockholm's bid to host the 2004 Olympic Games has decreased.
</P>
<P>
A report published on Saturday said that opposition has fallen

ZHENGZHOU, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Zoo workers in Zhengzhou, the
capital of China's Henan Province, freed 30 herons last week.
</P>
<P>
The birds had been saved by Zhengzhou residents when they fell
from their nests in trees because of wounds or illness. And, local
police seized others being sold on the black market or being
smuggled out of the area.
</P>

Veterinarians and other zoo staff have taken good care of the
herons, some of which were still fledglings. They fed the birds
small fish and after three months' care, they had become healthy
again.
</P>
<P>
Zhengzhou is called the "green city" by its residents because
of the tall green trees that line its streets. Many herons have
made their nests on those trees in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The local people have developed a better sense of caring for
wildlife, according to an official with the provincial wild animal
protection office, who noted that about 10,000 wild animals are
saved by local people yearly.

BUENOS AIRES, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Diego Maradona said on
Saturday that he had no chance to play for Argentina at the World
Cup in France next year.
</P>
<P>
"I don't have hopes of playing in the World Cup in France,"

Maradona captained Argentina to World Cup victory in 1986 and

a banned stimulant.
</P>
<P>
He has made many comebacks but most have petered out quickly.
His latest began a few weeks ago when he took the field for his

115-114 in a fight he controlled from round one and in which he
had Tafer reeling in round eight.
</P>
<P>
Dominguez kept coming forward with confidence, pounding Tafer
with both fists and heavily marking the Frenchman's face by the
end of the bout.
</P>
<P>
Tafer, knocked out by Dominguez two years ago in the ninth
round, put up better resistance this time but there was never any
real doubt who would win.
</P>
<P>
It was Dominguez's fifth defence and he now has 22 victories,
12 inside the distance, with one defeat and one draw.
</P>
<P>
Tafer, 30 on August 27, now has 23 wins and seven defeats.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment Increase In Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment is a new force
in Tibet's economic growth, with 100 foreign investors having put
a total of 236.29 million US dollars into the region by this past
July, according to the regional Administration for Industry and
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the region had 9.16 million US dollars worth of
foreign investment, say local officials, who regard overseas
funds, technology, and advanced management techniques as important
for Tibet's economic development.
</P>
<P>
The local authorities have adopted flexible policies to attract
money into the plateau region. In the past, overseas funds have
mostly come from Hong Kong, Macao, Nepal and other neighboring
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, businesses in Japan, the United States, and Australia
have shown an increasing interest, and the pharmaceutical,
electronics, and tourism businesses, in additional to the
traditional food and handicraft industries, have come to be
supported by overseas funds.
</P>
<P>
Officials say that comparatively developed areas like Lhasa,
the capital, and Shannan and Xigaze prefectures are foreign
investors' favorite spots due to the better basic infrastructure
there.

<HEADLINE> Montgomery Wins 100m at IAAF Grand Prix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Tim Montgomery, bronze medalist at
the recent World Championships, won the 100m at the IAAF Grand
Prix meeting in Monaco on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Montgomery, also third in Zurich three days ago, was a clear
winner in 9.99 seconds in a field which included Leroy Burrell of
the United States, who has run the second fastest time in
history. However Burrell could only finish a disappointing
seventh.
</P>
<P>
And Namibia's Frankie Fredericks beat world champion Ato Boldon
of Trinidad and Tobago into second place over 200m in a time of
19.93.
</P>
<P>
World 800m champion and world record holder Wilson Kipketer
hardly broke sweat in winning his race.
</P>
<P>
Kenya-born Dane Kipketer, who smashed the world record in
Zurich just three days ago with 1:41.24, ran a still impressive
1:42.77 with Kenyans Patrick Konchellah and Hezekiel Sepend second
and third.
</P>
<P>
American Bryan Bronson beat out recently-crowned world 400m
hurdles champion Stephane Diagana of France by a meter in the
fastest time in the world this year of 47.64 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's Falilat Ogunkoya, who finished fifth at the World
Championships, won the event in 49.48 seconds.
</P>
<P>
But in the women's javelin, world champion Trine Hattestad of
Norway could only finish second to Oksana Ovshinnikova of Russia,
who threw 68.38m.
</P>
<P>
World champions Allen Johnson and Carla Sacramento of the
United States kept their forms at the meet, with Johnson winning
the 100m hurdles in 13.18 and Sacramento taking the women's 1,500m
at 4:01.86.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Zambia defeated the Democratic
Republic of Congo 2-0 in a Group 3 World Cup qualifying match in
Lusaka on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Zambia opened the account in the 35th minute through Frazer
Kamwandi, who headed into the net after a long pass from Kenneth
Malitoli from the left flank.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese, like Zambia fielding mostly young players,
started their game on high tempo with Litimba Motomoyi and Mpia
Luata trying hard to penetrate the Zambian defence.
</P>
<P>
Masauso Tembo for Zambia was given a yellow card by referee
Edwin Senai from Botswana.
</P>
<P>
In the opening minute of the second half, Kamwandi beat the
Congolese goalkeeper Mayala Makweni but only to hit the post.
Kamwandi came back once more hitting the back of the net in the
56th minute after a brilliant pass from Masauso Tembo, making it
2-0.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's game was a mere formality after both teams failed to
qualify for the World Cup finals next year.

<HEADLINE> Muslim Refugees Return to Croat-Controlled Jajce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Muslim refugees today
began returning to the Croat-controlled Jajce area in central
Bosnia in what is the test case of the on-and-off relations
between the two ethnic partners.
</P>
<P>
The return was in line with an agreement reached Wednesday
between Muslims and Croat officials, allowing 474 families of
displaced Muslims to return their homes to villages around the
town of Jajce.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, some 100 refugees arrived at the village
of Kruscica today from the Muslim-controlled town of Travnik and
many more were expected to go back to the villages of Lendici,
Lucici, Divicani and Sibenica next week.
</P>
<P>
The return was reported as free of any incident by the NATO-led
peacekeeping forces which were patroling the roads to monitor the
situation.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, more than 500 Muslim refugees who had just
returned to their homes in the Jajce area were forced to flee
again by Croat protesters who claimed that the return was not
agreed upon in advance.

<HEADLINE> US to Develop Solar Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States aims to
increase the number of solar industry employees to 70,000 by 2010
from some 12,000 now, industry sources said.
</P>
<P>
The goal is in line with the Clinton administration's scheme to
put a million solar systems on the roofs of commercial and
residential buildings by 2010.
</P>
<P>
As the leading producer of solar energy in the world, the U.S.
put out 38.9 megawatts in 1996, sharing 44 percent of world
production of 88.6 megawatts, followed by two other major
producers -- Japan and Europe, the industry publication PV News
reported.
</P>
<P>
The government has invested some 1.5 billion U.S. dollars in
the solar industry in the past 25 years and is continuing to
encourage the use of solar cells to decrease gases omitted from
burning of fossil fuels.
</P>
<P>
Local governments have also started to make efforts in this
direction. California is to allocate 54 million dollars in 1998
for subsidies to solar energy users while Arizona requires that at
least 1 percent of new energy generation comes from solar
resources.
</P>
<P>
The industry has to lower solar cell prices to find more local
consumers. About two thirds of last year's solar cell sales
totaling 850 million dollars came from overseas.
