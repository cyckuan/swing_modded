SPORTS COLUMN: JETS' COX HEARS IT IN THE SIXTH BOROUGH
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout)   (sw) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ For a linebacker, trying to sack Dan Marino isn't much
different from trying to knock the gun out of a mugger's hand while
the trigger is being pulled. But it can be done.
</P>
<P>
   And on Sunday night it was done five times, with Chad Cascadden
scoring the clinching touchdown in the Jets' 21-16 victory over the
Dolphins by hurrying 23 yards after defensive end Ernie Logan had
stripped the ball while Marino was trying to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the second quarter, Bryan Cox burst between the
Dolphins' pass blockers on third down, slammed the 37-year-old
quarterback into the green grass for an 8-yard sack, leaped high,
waved his arms at all those ``Dolfans'' in Pro Player Stadium and
tap-danced to the Jets' sideline.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolfans weren't waving back, but the Jet fans were. Whenever
the Jets or any New York team is on display here among the palm
trees, several thousand New York expatriates turn Miami into the
sixth borough.
</P>
<P>
   Cox was delighted at the Dolfans' silence. Three seasons ago, he
was Miami's most exciting linebacker and their most excitable
linebacker. When the 1995 season ended, and Don Shula decided to
stop coaching, Cox decided, he has said, to depart as a free agent
out of loyalty to Shula.
</P>
<P>
   Others wondered if Jimmy Johnson, imported to succeed Shula,
would have wanted Cox, who moved to the Bears for two tempestuous
seasons before Bill Parcells hired him last summer after Marvin
Jones was lost for the season because of damaged knee.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reasons for Cox's departure, he appeared to be
playing about a foot off the ground in harassing Marino. Despite
being double-teamed by Dolphin blockers on a third-and-3 during the
third quarter, his left arm deflected one of Marino's bullets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan has got that 30-something body,'' Cox said during the
week, ``but he's still got a 20-something arm.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Cox's sack, linebackers Mo Lewis and Cascadden
soon collaborated on another. In the second half, defensive tackle
Jason Ferguson and linebacker Pepper Johnson each knocked the gun
out of Marino's hand.
</P>
<P>
   Until Sunday night, Marino had been sacked only 16 times this
season, including a high of three in one game by the Jets (in their
earlier 20-9 victory), the Patriots and the Bills.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Miami has often been a nice place for the Jets
to visit. Miami is where the 1968 Jets fulfilled Joe Namath's
``guarantee'' in Super Bowl III. Miami is where the 1982 Jets got
stuck in the mud against the Dolphins in the American Football
Conference championship game, alias the strange case of the missing
tarpaulin. Miami is where Raul Allegre's overtime field goal lifted
the 1991 Jets into the playoffs in their season finale.
</P>
<P>
   And on Sunday night, Miami is where the 1998 Jets were playing
the Dolphins for first place in the AFC East.
</P>
<P>
   In each of these crossroad games, palm trees swayed in the
breeze _ outside the Orange Bowl for Super Bowl III and the muddy
AFC championship game, outside Pro Player Stadium for Allegre's
field goal and, last night, for Bill Parcells' stomping on the
sideline.
</P>
<P>
   The story line of each game has mirrored the various emotions of
Jets history: celebration, frustration, expectation and aspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells keeps talking about aspiring ``to get there,'' meaning
the Super Bowl XXXIII playoffs. He would prefer to get there with a
first-place team, ideally with a bye through the wild-card weekend
into the divisional playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But the Jets can't be choosy, not after having been 4-28 in the
two seasons before Parcells arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Of their four crossroad games in Miami, the uncommon denominator
is that the Jets have had a different coach each time _ the late
Weeb Ewbank in Super Bowl III, Walt Michaels in the mud, Bruce
Coslet in 1991, Parcells now.
</P>
<P>
   When the Jets stunned the pro football realm with their 16-7
defeat of the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III, it was only the
franchise's ninth season.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, a season interrupted by a players strike, the Jets had
a 6-3 record, tied for fourth in the overall standing. In the
playoffs, they quickly routed the Cincinnati Bengals, 44-17, as
Freeman McNeil galloped for 202 yards, then jarred the Los Angeles
Raiders, 17-14, as linebacker Lance Mehl had two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Jets arrived at the Orange Bowl for the AFC
championship game, the field resembled a rice paddy. Despite heavy
rain on Thursday and mostly steady rain thereafter until almost
game time, the field had been left uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   When the Jets lost, 14-0, their president, the late Jim Kensil,
growled about the absence of a tarpaulin. So did their coach, Walt
Michaels, who quietly suspected Shula of having created the mud to
sabotage a Jets offense that depended on the speed of McNeil and
wide receiver Wesley Walker.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I know is the rules,'' Michaels grumbled. ``I
can't understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Michaels was referring to the NFL constitution, which requires
each team to have a tarpaulin available. But the Dolphins blamed
the city of Miami, which operates the Orange Bowl, for the absence
of a tarpaulin. Whoever was at fault, the Jets lost. About two
weeks later, Michaels lost his job as the Jets' coach.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets haven't been close to the Super Bowl since then. But on
Sunday night, with first place at stake in their division, the Jets
were in Miami again. Where else would they be? &QL;

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ In a perfect world, John Elway would have
thrown the winning touchdown pass to Shannon Sharpe with 48 seconds
remaining, sending Denver on its way to Miami with a 14-0 record.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But this is an imperfect world, and it was Giants quarterback
Kent Graham and receiver Amani Toomer who wrote NFL history and
proved once again that nobody's perfect _ except for the 1972 Miami
Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   Denver's quest for perfection ended Sunday when Toomer outfought
cornerback Tito Paul for the ball on a 37-yard touchdown pass at
the back of the end zone as New York defeated the Broncos 20-16,
handing Denver its first loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long time since we lost, and it brings back some
bad memories, but the only way we're going to top winning the last
Super Bowl is to win this one,'' Elway said after the Broncos fell
for the first time in 12 months. ``Finishing undefeated would have
made it even better.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you win that many games in a row, you start to think you
can't lose. That (going unbeaten) was a goal of ours, but it wasn't
our main goal. We're disappointed, obviously, but it's not like our
season's down the drain.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Broncos tried to put on a happy face, it was
obvious in their actions and expressions how important it was to
them to become the first team to finish 19-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't give the Vince Lombardi Trophy for numbers,''
Sharpe said. ``They give it for winning the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather this happen now than four weeks from now. Our
objective has been and is to play in Miami (Super Bowl XXXIII) in
late January, and anything less is unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're judged by the end result. If we win another Super Bowl,
this game won't mean a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway and Sharpe were right, of course, but six other teams have
won back-to-back Super Bowls. The 1972 Dolphins, who finished 17-0,
remain the NFL's only unbeaten and untied champion.
</P>
<P>
   By allowing the Giants to go 86 yards in six plays to win on
Graham's pass to Toomer, the Broncos also blew their chance to set
an NFL record with 19 consecutive victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speaking for myself, I'm happy as hell that's off our backs,''
Denver defensive tackle Keith Traylor said. ``We had a killer run,
but our goal is to win the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams started ganging up on us and passing their game plan
down the line. We're champions, and champions don't like to lose,
but the wear and tear of it (the winning streak) was wearing me
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's why the Broncos' defense collapsed on the last
series.
</P>
<P>
   It never should have come down to the last series, but the
Giants' defense was outstanding, limiting Denver to three Jason
Elam field goals until the last five minutes of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell Davis, who finished with 147 yards on 28 carries, scored
Denver's only touchdown on a 27-yard run, giving the Broncos a
16-13 lead with 4:08 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' Gary Brown, who ran for 112 yards, had touched the
ball 807 times since he lost a fumble in 1994 with the Oilers. With
3:36 left in the game, he had the ball stripped by safety Tyrone
Braxton. Linebacker Bill Romanowski recovered at Denver's 29.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos faced second-and-one, but the Giants threw Davis and
fullback Howard Griffith for losses, forcing a Tom Rouen punt that
gave New York the ball at its 14. Graham had 1:49 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Graham completed two passes for 26 yards, then ran for 23. Then,
on first down from the 37 with 57 seconds left, Graham found Toomer
in the end zone for one of the most dramatic touchdowns in Giants
history.
</P>
<P>
   One official signaled that Toomer was out of the end zone. But
after a brief discussion, he was overruled.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't panic, but neither did we,'' Giants offensive
tackle Scott Gragg said. ``We knew we had to play a perfect game.
It wasn't perfect, but it was close enough. We were lucky to have
two turnovers and still beat a team like the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the nature of the game _ every team's beatable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos had shown they weren't invincible in their last two
victories, over San Diego and Kansas City. Although they entered
play Sunday third in the league in points allowed, they don't have
a great defense.
</P>
<P>
   And the Broncos proved it again Sunday when they allowed the
Giants to drive 86 yards at the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a lot like last year when we lost two of our last
three,'' said Elway, who completed 19 of 36 passes for 180 yards
with one interception. ``But we turned that around, and we can do
it again. At this point, everything is designed to be playing our
best football going into the playoffs, and we can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Braxton said, ``It's very disappointing any time you get a
chance to separate yourself from the league for years and years and
years, and you don't achieve that goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing and depressing.''
</P>
<P>
   Denver's next game is at Miami a week from tonight. The Broncos
close at home against Seattle. They need more consistency on
offense, and they have to get tougher on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't look past the Giants,'' Elway said. ``It didn't
matter who we were playing in the next game. We just got beat by a
team that played a great game. Their defense was outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the Broncos have the same 13-1 record as
Minnesota, and the Vikings are playing better.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been getting tougher every week because we were getting
everybody's best shot,'' Elway said. ``We definitely weren't going
to be sneaking up on anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got bothersome to keep talking about going unbeaten. We
didn't bring it up until the media asked us about it, which was
almost every day. It gives me a new appreciation for the 1972
Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't lose, and that's hard to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The streak was special, something we were shooting for,''
coach Mike Shanahan said. ``It's tough to lose this one, and
everybody's real disappointed. It's going to take awhile to get
over, but we're still looking forward to the challenge that's ahead
of us.''

CHARGERS EASY PICKINGS FOR SEAHAWKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ After a season of disappointment, a week of answering
questions about whether the Seahawks would come out flat after
being robbed by an official's call and too many days of hearing
raves for the San Diego Chargers' defense, Darryl Williams had
endured enough.
</P>
<P>
   When the Seahawk defensive players gathered Saturday night for
their weekly meeting, Williams, the Pro Bowl free safety and
defensive co-captain, stood up and guaranteed there would be no
lack of effort from his unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to let that happen and I know 22 guys on defense
who aren't going to let that happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' message came across oh-so-loud and ever-so-clear at
the Kingdome Sunday, as the defense scored twice and set up three
other scores in the Seahawks' stunning 38-17 romp over the
Chargers.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks forced eight turnovers and set an NFL record for
touchdown returns with their 11th and 12th of the season. Defensive
tackle Cortez Kennedy scooped up a fumble and ran it back 39 yards
for the first score of his career, and nickel back Terry McDaniel
returned an interception 43 yards for another TD.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle also set a club record by intercepting the Chargers'
befuddled tandem of Craig Whelihan and Ryan Leaf seven times _
including two each by cornerback Shawn Springs, strong safety Jay
Bellamy and Williams.
</P>
<P>
   It was an effort that left defensive coordinator Greg McMackin
in tears as he tried to explain just what it meant to him, his
players and embattled coach Dennis Erickson, especially after the
one-point loss to the Jets last week where New York quarterback
Vinny Testaverde was awarded a game-winning TD despite not getting
into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of pride on this team,'' McMackin said. ``They
care about coach Erickson, and that's obvious the way they play for
him. They won't quit. Everybody thought they'd be flat after last
week, but I had no doubt in my mind that they would come out and
play because they're a class act and there's no quit in them.''
</P>
<P>
   It also was an effort that left the Seahawks 7-7 and still in
the AFC playoff chase _ mathematically, if not realistically. The
Seahawks can get to nine wins by defeating the Indianapolis Colts
at the Kingdome this week and the now once-beaten Broncos in Denver
next week. Even that won't get them into the playoffs for the first
time since 1988 without help, a lot of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playoffs?'' defensive end Michael Sinclair asked with a
puzzled look. ``At this point, I don't even care. We've got Indy
coming in here, so all our focus is on getting (win) No. 8. I'm not
thinking about anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Number 7 was just one more dominating defensive performance in a
game where the still-struggling offense needed all the help it
could get. Quarterback Jon Kitna, making his third start, had the
worst outing of his young NFL career, completing 16 of 31 passes
for 140 yards and three interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've won a lot of games this year because of our defense,''
said running back Ricky Watters, who ran for 69 yards and became
the first player in NFL history to have 1,000-yard seasons with
three different teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawk triumph was bitter for Chargers interim coach June
Jones, who announced last week he was leaving after the season to
become head coach at the University of Hawaii, his alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed,'' Jones said. ``Our defense showed the
spirit that has made them No. 1 all year, but you can't give the
ball away that many times on offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried about everything to get it going, and we just
couldn't throw it to the right guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Whelihan, the Chargers' starter, threw five interceptions. Leaf,
the rookie from Washington State and No. 2 pick in last spring's
draft, had two passes picked off and also fumbled twice. Jones
shuffled the two in the second half, but neither could get the job
done.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks didn't do anything fancy defensively. They just did
it well. They blitzed more than they have in recent weeks, using
the front seven to pressure the quarterback. That left the
secondary to make plays. And make plays. And make plays.
</P>
<P>
   McDaniel was up first. He intercepted a Whelihan pass that was
intended for Ryan Thelwell and dove into the end zone to give the
Seahawks a 14-7 lead at the end of the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Williams then picked Whelihan again to set up a 1-yard TD run by
Watters in the second quarter. It was Williams' first interception
this season after tying for the AFC lead last year with eight.
</P>
<P>
   Williams struck again midway through the third quarter. This
time, he picked off Leaf to set up Kitna's 9-yard TD pass to Joey
Galloway, giving the Seahawks a 28-14 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The clincher was Kennedy's rumbling return of a Leaf fumble
early in the fourth quarter. It was enough that the 306-pound
tackle recovered the fumble caused when defensive end Matt LaBounty
sacked Leaf. But Kennedy then spun to elude a would-be tackler and
was gone. No one caught him. No one even got close, as Kennedy
crossed the goal line and disappeared up the tunnel that leads to
the visiting locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had high-stepped,'' Springs offered with a grin, ``I
probably would have passed out.''
</P>
<P>
   What made the Seahawk defensive effort even more impressive was
that they did it without several key performers. Middle linebacker
Dean Wells, situational safety Mark Collins and No. 3 defensive
tackle Dan Saleaumua remained out with injuries. Cornerback Willie
Williams was named inactive before the game with the strained heel
he received in last week's loss to the Jets. And Sinclair, the AFC
sack leader and Pro Bowl defensive end, sat out the second half
after pinching a nerve in his left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie linebacker DeShone Myles, backup safety Kerry Joseph, No.
4 defensive tackle Riddick Parker, cornerbacks Fred Thomas and
McDaniel and LaBounty not only stepped in, they stepped up.
</P>
<P>
   Sinclair had a front-row seat after his injury, and he was
impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a Picasso,'' Sinclair said. ``Those guys were all
over the place. I was entertained myself. I don't think you could
have drawn it up any better today.''

ASTROS SAY CLEMENS DEAL TOO COSTLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Johnny Oates sat at a table on a ballroom
dais hoping to talk baseball but was instead looking for an escape.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Rangers manager was taking all sorts of questions
about small markets and large markets, private jets and hotel
suites, players set to earn $100,000 every 25 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like talking baseball,'' Oates said Sunday at baseball's
winter meetings. ``I don't know bottom line, red line, whatever. I
like to talk hit-and-run, breaking ball ...''
</P>
<P>
   No such luck. Four hours later, from the same platform, Houston
Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker called a news conference and
threw a high, hard one under the chin of Roger Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros are Clemens' hometown team and seemed to be the
pitcher's likely destination after he demanded a trade from the
Toronto Blue Jays. But that changed when Clemens' agents, Randy and
Alan Hendricks, told Houston owner Drayton McLane just how much it
would take to restructure Clemens' contract.
</P>
<P>
   For Houston, it's Roger, over and out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, we are absolutely stunned and really outraged
at the demands,'' Hunsicker said. ``I was with this franchise when
we made Nolan Ryan the first $1 million player, and I remember how
aghast the industry was at paying one player $1 million. So I guess
I've become hardened to the fact that anything can and eventually
does happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just extremely concerned about the health of the
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, pitcher Kevin Brown became baseball's first $100
million player, signing a seven-year, $105 million contract with
the Los Angeles Dodgers that guarantees him a suite on the road and
12 flights per year for his family on the Fox jet.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, who has five Cy Young awards _ five more than Brown _
reportedly asked for one year and $27.4 million to be added to his
contract, which pays him $16.1 million for the next two years.
Clemens' deal was the richest ever for a pitcher when he signed it
in 1996, but he has leverage now because he can veto any trade.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers and Colorado Rockies remain interested in Clemens,
and the New York Yankees are always a possibility. The Blue Jays
and Clemens had an understanding that Clemens could be traded to a
contender if he was unhappy with the direction of the franchise,
but Toronto general manager Gord Ash said Clemens could remain with
the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' Ash said. ``He has a contract.''
</P>
<P>
   The whole situation is ``mind-boggling'' to Hunsicker. If
Houston were to pay Clemens what he wanted and trade Toronto what
it wanted, he said, the club could not contend anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, I don't blame the player, because this is a
free-market society and everyone wants to get what people are
willing to pay,'' Hunsicker said. ``I'm concerned for the industry,
because more and more people seem to be trying to extract every
last nickel from the system. And it's not a matter of trying to pay
the bills every month. It's going way past that. It's
one-upsmanship, is what it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the rate we're going, it won't be long until clubs will
have to close up shop. ... Everybody recognizes the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The winter meetings were brought back to capitalize on
baseball's renaissance, but talk has centered on the industry's
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's lunacy, it really is,'' said San Diego Padres general
manager Kevin Towers, whose team lost Brown on Saturday. ``It's
crazy, and I think we're headed for disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The toughest thing is we're all so competitive, but I think we
need to police ourselves _ not just owners but the players union
and everyone in the industry. ... The thing we need to keep in mind
is the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Towers said he hoped negotiations on the next Basic Agreement
would be less contentious because of two additions to the
commissioner's office _ former Toronto president Paul Beeston and
former Oakland president Sandy Alderson, who was critical of the
Brown signing Saturday. But even with two to three years remaining
on the labor agreement that came out of the 1994-95 strike, people
are wondering what that mess was all about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, it will end. The question is, who's going to end
it, who's in charge to end it,'' said Montreal Expos manager Felipe
Alou, who turned down an offer from the cash-rich Dodgers this
winter to stay with the cash-poor Expos. ``I can't complain,
because I'm getting paid real well myself, but four years after the
strike, it's amazing to see what's going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know what to say about it. I'm surprised every
day when I wake up and read the papers.''
</P>
<P>
   Another small-market manager, Jack McKeon of the Cincinnati
Reds, had similar concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you sit back and wonder where we're going and how
many jobs are going to be left if we continue to go at this pace
and don't put people in the ballpark,'' he said. ``Sometimes it's
scary.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds, like the Padres, Mariners and others, will soon open a
new ballpark that should give hope to the franchise. But what has
happened this winter _ especially this week _ signifies to many
that a new facility is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker, whose team opens a retractable-roof park in 2000,
believes it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it means,'' he said, ``is most of us are in trouble if
we're not going to be able to compete for the top talent in this
industry.''

`CLASS ACT' KENNEDY RIGHTFUL RECIPIENT OF GLORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ For a split second, Cortez Kennedy thought he'd better
just fall on the football.
</P>
<P>
   It was bouncing on the turf below him, punched loose from the
hands of San Diego rookie/punk quarterback Ryan Leaf, who was
making a desperation appearance at the Kingdome thanks to a Seahawk
defense hell-bent on making the Chargers pay for every rotten thing
the Seahawks have experienced this season.
</P>
<P>
   That is why when Kennedy saw the ball skittering under his giant
feet, his eyes grew huge.
</P>
<P>
   The ball looked as big and juicy as a porterhouse. And Lord
knows how good a steak looks to a 306-pound defensive tackle _
impossible to resist.
</P>
<P>
   So at that very moment, with the Hawks already leading the
Chargers at the start of the fourth quarter and the game gone awry
with interceptions and turnovers, Kennedy thought about falling on
the ball. But then the man called Tez got a better idea.
</P>
<P>
   He decided he was gonna run. Just run, baby, all the way to the
promised land.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my first touchdown ever, ever in life,'' Kennedy said
after the 38-17 Seahawk win _ a game nearly as hysterical as it was
historical, because quarterbacks Jon Kitna, Craig Whelihan and Leaf
appeared to have read the wrong rule book.
</P>
<P>
   The point of the game is to put the ball into the hands of your
own teammates, not the other guys'.
</P>
<P>
   Kitna was picked off three times, but the Hawks victimized Leaf
and Whelihan seven times _ twice for touchdowns. Then there was the
exclamation point.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's 39-yard touchdown gambol was the 12th Seahawk
touchdown off turnovers this season, setting an NFL record.
</P>
<P>
   Tez, his teammates and the chipper Kingdome crowd ate up the
sight of the big man rumbling to glory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the greatest feelings in the world,'' Kennedy
said. ``At first I thought (Seahawk corner) Fred Thomas was one of
the Chargers. I thought I'd better put my hand on the ball and fall
down. But then I saw it was Fred, so I turned on a little more
speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Speed? Well, not exactly Joey Galloway afterburner stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him he ran like he did when he was a senior at the
University of Miami, when he was 26 years old,'' coach Dennis
Erickson joked.
</P>
<P>
   Tez denied a youthful burst of energy: ``I felt like I was about
40 years old. I wasn't meant to run that fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren Moon was so concerned he greeted Kennedy at the sideline
with an oxygen tank and mask in hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a joke,'' Moon said. ``He needed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was determined, though. He has watched all season as his
defensive partners have racked up nearly as many points as the
Seahawk offense. He figured it was his turn to make the highlights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense has been doing it all year,'' Kennedy said. ``I
was just jumping in there with Chad Brown, Sam Adams and the rest
of those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Except there is a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of 11-year veteran Brian Blades, no current Seahawk has
been with the team longer than Kennedy, a six-time Pro Bowler.
</P>
<P>
   No players outside of Blades and Michael Sinclair knows what
it's like to live through a 2-14 season and play though an
ownership shake-up, then to have payroll increased to $65 million
and still come up short, as the Hawks have this season.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Seahawks lost a game to the Jets. Lost, too, was
any realistic shot at the playoffs _ thanks in large part to a
terrible call on Vinny Testaverde's quarterback draw.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was on the line that Sunday. He tripped up Testaverde.
It was Kennedy's tackle and safety Jay Bellamy's crushing hit on
Testaverde that should have sealed the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that bitter taste stayed with us strong and hard all
week,'' Bellamy said. ``We talked about it this week. We talked
about it during our meeting (Saturday night).
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to show everyone the way this defense could respond
to a game like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hence, all the pass rushes Sunday. All the pressure, all the
picks, and then the exclamation point touchdown run by the
nine-year veteran.
</P>
<P>
   It won't make up for a season gone bust. It won't make it easier
for Erickson to keep his job, though surely the Hawk defense is
showing there is no quit this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could not have been scripted any more perfectly than to
have a class act like Cortez make such a great play worthy of
recognition for the entire team, for the entire defense,''
defensive coordinator Greg McMackin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are going to be remembered for something, it's just
really fitting for it to be Cortez to make the big play. He's been
a class act. When we came here, he was the cornerstone we built our
defense on.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the cornerstone decided to run. What a funny, wonderful,
excellent call.

ASS'AD WANTS TO COACH WOMEN'S TEAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Marwan Ass'ad spent a coaching lifetime building
Cal State Northridge's men's soccer team but is willing to give it
up to become the women's soccer coach at the school.
</P>
<P>
   That position will be vacant Dec. 31, when coach Brian Wiesner's
resignation takes effect.
</P>
<P>
   But why would the 44-year-old Ass'ad make the switch? Simple.
Stability and potential.
</P>
<P>
   Much more emphasis is placed on the women's program at CSUN than
the men's program. Just look at the scholarship allotments for each
program.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining part of his reasoning for making the jump, if the
job were offered to him, Ass'ad said the commitment from the
administration was in place to build the women's team into a
winning program. He said he liked the fact the women's program is
given 12 scholarships; the men's program must operate on only two.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential for the program is incredible,'' Ass'ad said.
``There are so many people who support women's soccer in the
Valley. I think we can have 2,000 people there per game. I don't
think it's a dream to get 2,000 people to a game.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also more stability in the women's program. Less than
two years ago CSUN created a public relations gaffe by dropping
four sports, one of which was men's soccer. The long-reaching
ramifications are still being felt.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN president Blenda Wilson said the sports were reinstated for
the long term, but fairly or not, speculation and mumblings exist
about the program's future.
</P>
<P>
   Finances are also an issue. Ass'ad said he made $18,000 annually
and supplements his income through camps and offseason coaching.
That supplementing would be possible with the women's job, but with
a higher base salary. Wiesner earned $37,956 per year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I would be doing it for the money because I
would have left by now if that was the case,'' said Ass'ad, who has
been at CSUN since 1983. ``I love the Valley. I don't want to
leave.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Another gridiron transfer? CSUN football coaches continue to
recruit the area high schools, but more news is being made in the
way of Division I transfers.
</P>
<P>
   The latest ``bounce back'' expected to transfer to CSUN is
Gardena product DeJuan Gilmore, sources in Pullman, Wash., said.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore, a running back, was on CSUN's campus a few weeks ago
and was impressed with the Matadors' coaching staff. He was
Washington State's second-leading rusher this past season. He
carried 65 times for 305 yards and three touchdowns. Gilmore also
caught six passes for 57 yards.
</P>
<P>
   __ The Harris chronicles: It's hard to get any kind of measure
on men's basketball player Rico Harris, who's long-awaited
indoctrination into Division I basketball has been filled with
pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, bothered by a hip-pointer, missed his third straight
game Saturday when the Matadors had their winning streak snapped at
five games at Brigham Young.
</P>
<P>
   However, he is hoping to be ready for Saturday's game with UCLA
at Pauley Pavilion, and for good reason. Plenty should be at stake
for the 6-foot-9 power forward.
</P>
<P>
   Barring the NCAA tournament, this is the final time NBA scouts
will have an opportunity to gauge Harris against the best
competition in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Harris, who's averaging 11.8 points and 6.4
rebounds per game, had such a chance was when the Matadors (6-3)
played at Tennessee last month. But he was suspended for violating
team rules, leaving a few handfuls of NBA scouts with little to
watch.

HACKETT TO REVIEW STAFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Although he ``doesn't foresee changes,'' USC coach
Paul Hackett said he intends to evaluate his coaching staff soon
after the Trojans play Texas Christian in the Sun Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett nearly lost defensive coordinator Bill Young to Hawaii
last week, but what about the possibility he might decide to alter
his staff?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying I would never make a change, but I don't
foresee changes,'' Hackett said. ``As the season comes to a close
after the bowl game, I will sit down with everybody and talk. I go
through an evaluation process.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an emotional job. Every year, you evaluate every
aspect of the program. It's the same thing with coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Few within the program expect offensive coordinator Hue Jackson
to return next season, although no decisions have been made yet.
Although Jackson called the plays in the second half of the Notre
Dame game, he has relinquished play calling to Hackett for almost
the entire season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a guy wants to better himself, I would let him pursue
that,'' Hackett said. ``Anybody interested in a job has my
blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Strong safety?: Freshman tailback Frank Strong has
contemplated moving over to defense, perhaps to the secondary, but
intends to remain on offense at least through the end of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``To change positions would show a lack of confidence,'' Strong
said. ``I feel pretty good about tailback right now. I feel my
heart is at tailback.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong's playing time reduced dramatically after he fumbled
twice against Florida State and once against California.
</P>
<P>
   __ Ready for a break: Tailback Chad Morton will enjoy having
this week off because he will finally get a chance to rest his sore
ankle, which has bothered him since the Stanford game in early
November.
</P>
<P>
   ``My ankle is still sore once in awhile,'' Morton said. ``This
week will be good for it.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Change in schedule: The Trojans will hold a light practice
Friday, then hold a regular practice Saturday. Originally, they
were supposed to be off the entire week and resume practicing
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   __ Welch cleared: Offensive tackle Matt Welch has been cleared
again to practice, after suffering a rapid heart beat during the
Notre Dame game. It's believed to be a pre-existing condition that
he also experienced at Santa Ana JC.
</P>
<P>
   __ Sanford stays: Former USC assistant coach Mike Sanford, now
the quarterbacks coach at Notre Dame, has turned down the offensive
coordinator's position at Nevada-Las Vegas.

VACCO EXPECTED TO CONCEDE RACE FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Attorney General Dennis Vacco, the Republican who
has spent the last six weeks alleging voter fraud and fighting in
court to prevent the certification of his Democratic challenger,
Eliot Spitzer, as his successor, is expected to concede to Spitzer
on Monday, Republican officials said on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of an appearance in State Supreme Court, where Vacco
has been asked to show evidence of his many claims of voting
irregularities in New York City, the attorney general is preparing
for what is likely to be the end to one of the most unusual and
controversial episodes in New York political history _ one in which
his re-election effort touched quarters including the state courts
and the New York City Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Vacco said on Sunday night that the campaign
believed it had amassed evidence of voter fraud, but not enough to
make a difference in the outcome of the election.
</P>
<P>
   Since Election Day, when unofficial results showed him trailing
in one of the closest contests in this century, Vacco has lodged
several complaints of voting irregularities in New York City. He
raised allegations of votes being cast in the names of dead people
and claimed that thousands of people voted twice. But in the end,
his lawyers said, the attorney general did not accumulate enough
data to persuade the court to do what Vacco had sought: call a new
election or declare him the winner.
</P>
<P>
   If Justice Thomas Keegan of state Supreme Court dismisses
Vacco's case _ something both campaigns now consider likely _ it
will remove the final roadblock to certification of the unofficial
results: Spitzer won the election by 26,011 votes.
</P>
<P>
   While not confirming what position Vacco will take, Thomas
Spargo, a lawyer for the attorney general's campaign, said on
Sunday night that he would present evidence of thousands of votes
cast under some sort of cloud. He said he would detail votes that
were cast by people for whom death benefits were being paid as well
as votes case by New York City residents who had moved outside of
the state and registered to vote elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent the day reviewing our proof,'' Spargo said on Sunday
night, following a meeting with Vacco and William Powers, the state
Republican Party chairman. ``And while we think it's very
significant, it has not yet come up to the numbers that are needed
to impact the outcome of the election at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   While his fight to win a second term had seemed to many _
particularly in the Spitzer campaign _ to have been relentless,
several Republican elected officials said that the attorney
general's intermediaries had been hinting in recent days that
Vacco's effort was likely to be unsuccessful and that he would
concede on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attorney general has indicated that he felt it was time to
end the legal maneuvers,'' said a Republican member of the
legislature, who asked not to be named. ``He has been preparing for
this eventuality. He knows it's time to end this.''
</P>
<P>
   In unofficial results from the State Board of Elections, Spitzer
led with a margin of 26,011 votes out of 4.2 million cast. While
the Democratic challenger has declared victory, Vacco has not
conceded. The matter is becoming more urgent as Tuesday's deadline
for the Board of Elections to certify the election approaches.

TKACHUK PICKS HIS BATTLES THIS SEASON  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ In an eye-for-an-eye, tooth-for-a-tooth league, Keith
Tkachuk can turn the other cheek only so many times before he has
to pull a Norman Bates and go psycho.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the case last week in Phoenix, when after repeatedly
getting cross-checked in the back by Montreal's Alain Nasreddine,
the Coyotes captain threw down his gloves and began using
Nasreddine's face as a punching bag.
</P>
<P>
   It was Tkachuk's first major penalty of the season. And as well
as he has behaved lately, it probably won't be his last.
</P>
<P>
   Take tonight, for instance, when Tkachuk and the streaking
Coyotes (17-3-3) visit Nasreddine and the Canadiens (8-16-4) in a
rematch of Wednesday's grudge match, won by Phoenix, 4-2.
Nasreddine is back after serving a two-game suspension for his part
in the Tkachuk fight, and if he wants to duke it out again, that's
fine by Tkachuk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing my best to try and stay out of the box,'' said
Tkachuk, who two seasons ago became the first player in NHL history
to lead the league in goals scored (52) and collect more than 200
penalty minutes (228).
</P>
<P>
   ``But sometimes during the year, when guys are taking extra
liberties, you have to show people around the league that you're
not going to always take it, that you're going to do something
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Tkachuk's 35 penalty minutes through 23 games, almost half
came at the 3:56 mark of the third period during the Nasreddine
incident. He picked up an instigator penalty in addition to his
fighting major, and then got the obligatory 10-minute misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Nasreddine, meanwhile, got it where it hurts the most _ not just
in the head, but in the wallet. While trying to go toe to toe with
Tkachuk, he inexplicably dragged linesman Wayne Bonney to the ice.
The league suspended Nasreddine for ``physically demeaning'' the
official and fined him $1,000, the maximum allowed. He also
forfeited $3,900 in lost salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't mean to push the linesman,'' Nasreddine said. ``I was
falling down and I grabbed onto him.''
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk has seen several replays of the incident, but said, ``I
don't know what he was thinking. That was just stupidity by him.''
</P>
<P>
   As for tonight's game at the Molson Centre, Tkachuk isn't
expecting any retaliatory swipes from Nasreddine or the rest of the
Canadiens. With 15 goals and 28 points, and the Coyotes off to
their best start in franchise history, there are far more important
things to consider.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just part of hockey, what happened between me and
him,'' Tkachuk said. ``You move on. You don't hold any grudges. At
least I don't. He cheap-shotted me. But I took care of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes Coach Jim Schoenfeld has been pleased with Tkachuk's
restraint. At the same time, though, he said he was glad to see
Tkachuk take care of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great,'' Schoenfeld said. ``He's got to pick the
right time, but I think he absolutely has to take a stand
sometimes. Keith's been extremely disciplined all season long, but
there's a fine line there.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want him to be disciplined. You want him to play through
all that nonsense. But there comes a point in time where opponents
cross the line and take advantage of the situation. They think,
`Well, geez, here's this big, tough guy that's going to let me off
the hook.' But you can't keep letting them off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is, Keith knows when to make a stand and
when to play through it.''
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't just been Tkachuk. With proven heavyweight Jim
Cummins, the team's lone enforcer, being a healthy scratch for the
past 12 games, the Coyotes have collectively kept their cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most teams around the league see us as a pretty
disciplined team,'' Tkachuk said. ``I mean, we've got guys who can
back it up, but we play real well in between the whistles. We've
done a real good job of that this year. But as good as we've been,
as many games as we've won, we haven't played our best yet this
year. And that's kind of scary.'' &QL;

 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE _ Roger Clemens made an impassioned plea to the
Toronto Blue Jays two weeks ago, expressing a strong desire to be
traded to a contender.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, the only pitcher ever to win five Cy Young Awards, had
a handshake deal with the Blue Jays to trade him if he believed
Toronto was not going to have a chance to seriously contend.
</P>
<P>
   It all sounded so sweet and sincere, especially because Clemens
wanted to play closer to his home in suburban Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Hah!
</P>
<P>
   Now we know what Clemens really wants, and it's not necessarily
to play for a contender. Clemens, watching fellow pitchers Kevin
Brown and Randy Johnson sign contracts that will pay each in excess
of $13 million per season, wants money. Lots of it.
</P>
<P>
   He also wants the special perks that have become the rage among
the elite free agents.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens' demands came into full view Sunday afternoon after
Houston General Manager Gerry Hunsicker called a news conference to
announce the Astros, Clemens' hometown club, were dropping out of
the trade talks with Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime followers of baseball couldn't recall a time when a
club called a press conference to state they would NOT be making a
trade. Then again, baseball in 1998 is looking more bizarre by the
day.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, whose current contract calls for him to be paid a
combined $16.1 million over the next two seasons, wants a third
year tacked on to his current deal that will pay him $27.4 million,
bringing the total package to $43.5 million and putting him the
same economic stratosphere as Brown.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters easier for whatever club trades for Clemens, the
American League's Cy Young winner the past two seasons, the
right-hander is willing to spread that additional money over the
three years. What a guy.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens also wanted not one but two luxury suites and the use of
a corporate jet from the Astros. Why he wanted the jet is unknown,
considering his home is about a 40-minute drive to the Astrodome or
the Astros' new ballpark, which is scheduled to open in 2000. He
also wanted a luxury suite when the club is on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were absolutely stunned and outraged at the demands made by
his agents (Alan and Randy Hendricks),'' Hunsicker said.
``Philosophically, we were opposed to restructuring his contract.
But when they gave us their terms, it became a moot point.''
</P>
<P>
   It's become a childish game in which each of these elite players
is simply looking over his shoulder and saying, ``Hey, if Jimmy has
a candy bar and a Coke, then I want one. And I want a new bike,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   When will it all end?
</P>
<P>
   The Astros are to be commended for making their stand and
saying, ``No. We will not be blackmailed, no matter what we may be
giving up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros were flabbergasted at the claims being made by
Clemens, who you'd think could afford any and all of the
above-mentioned requests with the millions of dollars he is being
paid.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker quickly said he could not, in good conscience, allow
Clemens to have a suite while fellow All-Stars Jeff Bagwell and
Craig Biggio did not.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, baseball is played by individuals, but its the team concept
that remains the integral component of the game.
</P>
<P>
   It would be too naive to believe all the players will be treated
equally. Rightfully so, Babe Ruth had special concessions from the
Yankees, but those perks basically centered around money.
</P>
<P>
   Give the stars all the money, that's fine. But some of the
absurd requests clubs are giving in to can lead to divisions in
clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, some other club will turn around and probably
give in on Clemens' ``requirements,'' and that truly is too bad.
</P>
<P>
   All we can hope for is that the people who play this game for
the simple love of it never become outnumbered. &QL;

BLAKE SUSPENDED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Los Angeles Kings captain Rob Blake, who
returned to the lineup Saturday after missing six weeks with a
broken foot, once again found himself out of action Sunday, though
this time not because of an injury.
</P>
<P>
   Blake learned Sunday morning that he'd been suspended for what
would be a 3-0 loss to the Anaheim Mighty Ducks at the Pond for
slashing Vancouver's Harry York in the third period of Saturday's
3-0 victory over the Canucks. Blake, general manager Dave Taylor
and coach Larry Robinson will participate today in a telephone
hearing with NHL vice president Colin Campbell, at which point it
will be determined whether Blake will receive an extended sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very dirty game all around,'' Robinson said of
Saturday's game following Sunday's 3-0 loss to the Mighty Ducks at
the Pond. ``They had guys out there trying to hurt us, and one of
our guys ends up getting suspended. It doesn't seem fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake received a major slashing penalty and a game misconduct
from referee Don Koharski in the third period Saturday when he
slashed York on the arm. York left the game with a bruise and did
not return. Koharski could have assessed a match penalty to Blake
on the play _ which would have carried with it an automatic
suspension _ but chose not to. But Campbell saw the play and
believed at least a one-game suspension was warranted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to whack his stick and at the last second, he reached
out for the puck,'' Blake said. ``I don't think it was that bad,
but (York) went down like he was shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake is the second King suspended by the NHL this season.
Enforcer Matt Johnson is serving a 12-game suspension for
blindsiding defenseman Jeff Beukeboom of the New York Rangers on
Nov. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson had repeat-offender status, which contributed to the
severity of his suspension. Blake's last suspension - two games for
a high-sticking incident early in 1997 - was more than 18 months
ago, so he does not qualify under league rules as a repeat
offender.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rob Blake has been a pretty honest player in this league for a
long time,'' Taylor said. ``He plays hard, but he's certainly not
considered a dirty player.''
</P>
<P>
   One argument the Kings probably will make in Blake's defense is
that they were shorthanded at the time of his infraction and it's
doubtful he wanted to pick up another penalty that would leave his
team two men short.
</P>
<P>
   __ Bad ice: Not for the first time, complaints were issued about
the quality of the playing surface at the Pond, this time after the
Ducks defeated the Kings on Sunday. This time, it was Ducks right
wing Teemu Selanne who was grousing about the effect of poor ice on
the quality of play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking with (Ducks chairman Tony Tavares),'' said
Selanne, who scored two goals. ``I said, `We need to do something.'
They had a concert here (Saturday) night. It's always bad when they
put down new ice. Maybe we should practice here. The ice seems to
get better the more we use it. It would be so good for all the
skill players.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Pleasant problem: Ducks coach Craig Hartsburg insists he
wants to get backup goalie Dominic Roussel into some games. But the
excellent play of No. 1 goalie Guy Hebert is making that difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Hebert stopped 35 shots by the Kings on Sunday in recording his
second consecutive shutout and his fourth this season, matching a
career high. He has a 2.16 goals-against average and a .930 save
percentage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to get (Roussel) in there,'' Hartsburg said, ``but
I'm not going to take out a guy who's playing unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Loose pucks: The shutout was the first by either team in the
all-time series. The teams have met 29 times, and the series is
tied, 12-12-5. The Ducks have won the first two of six meetings
this season by a combined margin of 6-1. . . . Kings winger Eric
Lacroix suffered a broken clavicle in the Vancouver game and is
expected to be sidelined for at least a month. Lacroix's injury,
coupled with Blake's suspension, left the Kings with just enough
players to dress for Sunday's game. Rookie forward Olli Jokinen and
defenseman Garry Galley returned to the lineup after being healthy
scratches Saturday.

COWBOYS LIMP TOWARD THEIR DESTINY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ In the quiet of the Cowboys' locker room,
Leon Lett stood at his locker.
</P>
<P>
   Well, he sort of stood.
</P>
<P>
   Bruised and beaten, slowed by apparent pain, Lett's upper body
draped at an odd angle as he attempted to slip into his black
shirt. He looked like the Leaning Tower of Leon.
</P>
<P>
   Less than five feet away, Michael Irvin likewise dressed
oh-so-slowly. His torso at half-mast, Irvin had to steady himself
against the locker, just to get up from a stool.
</P>
<P>
   Some teams strut into the playoffs. History tells us that the
Cowboys prefer a diamond-studded swagger.
</P>
<P>
   But this was no strut. The Cowboys yesterday, losers of three
straight, had all the looks of a team with a limp, a limp toward
their destiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in excuses,'' coach Chan Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Really? OK, we won't, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that whoever steps in there, we expect them to be
able to play,'' Gailey continued, the 20-17 loss to the Kansas City
Chiefs still fresh in his craw.
</P>
<P>
   If life deals a coach lemons, Gailey's style is to try to turn
it into Team Lemonade. That's what he says, at least. That's what
they all said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we've been without a lot of people,'' quarterback Troy
Aikman echoed. ``But that's part of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't dwell on those guys who are not playing. You've just
got to go out and do your job.''
</P>
<P>
   No excuses, they said. And said.
</P>
<P>
   And so we won't offer any for them, either.
</P>
<P>
   We will ignore the missing Deion Sanders, cornerback, out with a
bad toe. We will forget the impact of receiver Ernie Mills, gone
for the season. We also won't mention tight end David LaFleur,
whose absence continues to stymie the running game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're on this team for a reason,'' center Mike Kiselak said.
``When you get the opportunity, you've got to play. Someone has to
rise to the occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the way, indeed, that it is supposed to work on teams
with championship ambitions. Behind every Elway is supposed to be a
Bubby Brister. The stars limp off. The beat goes on.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens when all of your salary-cap chips are riding on
the same star numbers? Who picks up the slack against the Chiefs,
against the Saints?
</P>
<P>
   Country Day's own Patrick Jeffers, for one. With first Mills
out, and then yesterday Irvin, the third-year receiver found
himself targeted by Aikman time and again. Some he caught; some he
didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike is known as `The Playmaker,' and there's a reason for
that,'' Jeffers said. ``When he went out, Billy \RDavis\S and I
looked at each other and said it was time to make some plays, time
to get some points.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Jeffers did help get the Cowboys into the end zone.
But he had one notable, drive-killing drop. And as for Davis, he
plainly disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, who once thought they enjoyed the luxury of team
depth, have found that depth is a relative term in the NFL of the
'90s. Because of injuries, they've had to go three- and four-deep
at the receiver and cornerback positions.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Jerry Jones' decision to invest in a select, long-term
nucleus of star players means that there is little, if any, to
spend on stand-ins. It is a decision that Owner Jones has always
defended.
</P>
<P>
   Funny, but both the head coach and the quarterback say,
``Injuries are part of the game.'' And the owner spends like the
team is Clark Kent.
</P>
<P>
   The offense struggled yesterday when the Chiefs decided that
they weren't about to let Emmitt Smith beat them. When Mills was
healthy and playing, receivers were getting open. Aikman seemed to
have a smorgasbord of choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm probably the most surprised,'' Gailey said. ``I thought we
were playing good, doing well. All of a sudden, we've hit a stretch
here where we're not moving the football. We've got to get that
straightened out.''
</P>
<P>
   Teams with ambitions find a way, Gailey knows. For three weeks,
though, his team has only found ways to lose.
</P>
<P>
   The injuries. The bruises. The soreness and spasms. Those are
all part of the game, the Cowboys themselves reminded us yesterday.
Lett isn't even one of the ones listed as officially hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever. With two weeks to go until the playoffs, the Cowboys
are not themselves, in some cases literally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not `our team'? '' Irvin repeated. ``Every guy out there
wearing those helmets with the stars on them is our team.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a team with a limp, we saw clearly yesterday. And one with
still a long road to go.

CARDINALS COME WITH NO GUAR ANTEE 
</HEADLINE>

   PHILADELPHIA _ They haven't beaten one team with a winning
record.
</P>
<P>
   Many look at them the way a bright, suspicious child looks at a
department store Santa, checking out the red suit that smells of
mothballs and studying the fit of the old man's remarkably white
beard.
</P>
<P>
   Is this a legitimate playoff team?
</P>
<P>
   Are the Cards for ``real''?
</P>
<P>
   When we tell them what we want for Christmas _ two more wins and
a January rematch with the Cowboys _ what assurances are there they
will come through?
</P>
<P>
   None, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ````Nothing's'' easy for us,'' Vince Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   If you want a guarantee, buy a toaster.
</P>
<P>
   There was no guarantee Sunday that the Cardinals could build on
a 10-0 lead. Or that they could make a first down on a questionable
fourth-and-one gamble. Or that their new kicker would step up and
nail a medium-range field goal from the middle of the field in the
final seconds of the fourth quarter to beat the Eagles, one of the
NFL's worst teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Cards blew the lead. Botched the gamble. The kick _ good
grief _ was wide.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the difference between the 3-11 Eagles and the 7-7
Cardinals may be not much more than a lucky guess uttered by an
offensive lineman who his teammates will tell you is older than a
Perry Como Christmas album.
</P>
<P>
   Lomas Brown called ``heads.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Heads, heads, heads, baby,'' Lomas said later, reliving the
moment, the most important call of the day. His whole face smiled.
</P>
<P>
   Heads it was.
</P>
<P>
   The score tied, the visitors won the toss and took the ball to
start overtime. Then, Jake Plummer and Rob Moore played catch and
Adrian Murrell ran, which he did all day, and when the time came to
redeem himself Chris Jacke used his mulligan to kick the ball 32
yards between the uprights.
</P>
<P>
   Cards, 20-17.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bidwill, wearing a winter topcoat, strolled through the
happy locker room reciting his favorite line after a close call _
``another laugher'' _ and smiling to himself. His son, Michael, lit
a victory cigar.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Wadsworth spoke for Jacke and Plummer and Moore and
Murrell and the injury-depleted defense. He spoke for everyone who
holds to the old-fashioned belief that if you work hard and keep
trying, good things come to those who wait. Goodness knows the
Cardinals have waited for something good to happen for a long, long
time.
</P>
<P>
   What Wadsworth said was this:
</P>
<P>
   ``Whew.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals held their position in the wild-card chase. If the
playoffs began next week, Arizona would be in.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Arizona Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Is this for real? Is it an illusion? One coach sighed with
relief and confessed, ``We're pulling rabbits.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have many critics. Even when the team wins, some
dismiss the achievement with a snort and dash off e-mails like one
that arrived in my office mailbox last week. It said, and I'm
paraphrasing, ``The Cardinals STINK!!! If you're not going to tell
it like it is, they should FIRE you.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Vince Tobin, I very much want to remain gainfully employed,
seeing as how my wife and I have three kids and a dog to feed and a
stack of bills, some overdue. It's not always easy writing about
the Cards for a living. I cannot begin to imagine coaching them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard on your nerves,'' Tobin said after this
cliff-hanger, or cliff-dweller, as one pressbox humorist called it.
``You get ``so'' wound up . . . then when it's over you feel
limp.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tobin wore a smile, and it looked good on him. After the
last two games, both losses, Vince paled, his face hardening like
ready-mix cement.
</P>
<P>
   The coach had every reason to feel pleased. His team found a way
to win a game it ``had'' to win on the road in a stadium _
Veterinarian Stadium, locals now call it _ that has not been kind
to the Cardinals in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Do our lads deserve to make the playoffs? If they get in, they
do.
</P>
<P>
   And on a cold dreary day they took another step toward that
goal, surviving a close hard-fought affair, although it's possible
that White House lawyers may argue that what transpired between
these two teams comprised of consenting adults technically does not
fall within the strict, legal definition of the word ``affair'' as
set forth by the judge in the grand jury testimony.

WIN IN OT RAISES HOPE FOR PLAYOFFS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Second-year quarterback Jake Plummer went hunting
for Cardinals kicker Chris Jacke on the sideline Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He passed several depressed offensive linemen, who had just
watched Jacke's 34-yard field goal attempt go wide right with 11
seconds left in regulation and the game tied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them, `Get up, this isn't over,' '' Plummer said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he found Jacke, who was in only his second game with
the team. ``I said, `Get ready. We're going to give you another
chance,' '' Plummer said.
</P>
<P>
   Jacke's second chance came with 4:30 gone in overtime, and he
connected from 32 yards to give the Cardinals a 20-17 victory over
3-11 Philadelphia before a much-smaller-than-announced crowd of
62,176 at Veterans Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big confidence boost for us,'' Plummer said. ``Had
we lost, the season was pretty much over.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory evened the Cardinals' record at 7-7 and left them
tied with Tampa Bay, a 16-3 winner over Pittsburgh, for the NFC's
third and last wild-card spot. But the Cardinals hold the edge over
the Buccaneers in the playoff tiebreaker because of a better NFC
record (7-4 to Tampa's 6-5).
</P>
<P>
   If the Cardinals win their remaining two games, both at home,
they will make the playoffs for the first time since 1982. They
play New Orleans (6-8) next Sunday and San Diego (5-9) on Dec. 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're right where we need to be,'' offensive tackle Lomas
Brown said. `` You couldn't ask for a better scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Vince Tobin already is looking for a big home-field
advantage at Sun Devil Stadium and made a public plea for fan
support next week against the Saints.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope the fans get behind this football team and realize
that this is a playoff atmosphere,'' Tobin said. ``We're going to
need all the help we can get.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, who blew a 10-0 first-quarter lead, appeared to
be in trouble with 2:29 left in regulation when the Eagles' Chris
Boniol lined up for a 33-yard field goal. Boniol, the NFL's most
accurate kicker ever, had made 67 field goals in a row from inside
the 36-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   But Boniol missed wide right, giving the Cardinals a chance to
break the 17-17 tie. ``I hit it low, and it spun off my toe and
went straight to the right,'' Boniol said. ``It never had a
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   A 23-yard run by Adrian Murrell, who finished with a game-high
174 yards, gave the Cardinals a first down at the Eagles' 39 with
1:55 left. Then Plummer's 19-yard pass to wide receiver Rob Moore
gave Jacke a try for the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   Jacke had made both of his field-goal tries since being signed
on Dec. 1 to replace the injured Joe Nedney. But, he, too, missed
wide right, sending the game into overtime, the Cardinals' first
extra session this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a bad kick,'' Jacke said.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals safety Tommy Bennett, who scored on a 70-yard
interception return in the first quarter, said his ``heart
dropped'' when Jacke missed.
</P>
<P>
   Brown acknowledged that many of the players were devastated.
But, unlike Plummer, he didn't say a word to Jacke, who had helped
Green Bay win a Super Bowl two years ago. ``It's better I didn't
say anything, with what I was thinking,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   It was Brown's job to call the coin toss in overtime. He
correctly called heads, giving the Cardinals the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great call by Lomas,'' rookie cornerback Corey
Chavous said. ``Fortunately, the referee heard the call correctly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, when I play the ``Playstation'' game, that's what I
call in overtime _ heads.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer came out throwing in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   His 30-yard pass to Moore gave the Cardinals a first down at the
Eagles' 41.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on third and 8, Plummer read the blitz and threw a pass to
Moore on the right sideline. Moore beat cornerback Troy Vincent for
a 16-yard gain to the Eagles' 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a classic fade route,'' said Moore, who finished
with seven catches for 109 yards and one score. ``Jake gave me the
signal. It just was step and go, and he threw the perfect pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Murrell's three runs left the Cardinals with a fourth and 1 at
the Eagles' 14.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia Coach Ray Rhodes tried to ice Jacke by calling
timeout, but it didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Timeouts don't do anything,'' Jacke said. ``I was disappointed
I missed the first one. But then we got down there for a relatively
short one again. I'm the lucky one. I got another opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer hit eight of his final 10 passes in the fourth quarter
and overtime, including a nine-yard scoring toss to Moore, who made
a diving catch in the end zone to tie the game at 17 with 8:14 left
in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The touchdown ended nearly 3{ quarters of frustration for the
Cardinals offense, which had scored only a field goal in three
trips inside the Eagles' 20-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only people who stopped us today is ourselves,'' said
center Aaron Graham of the team's 434 yards, including a
season-high 204 on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals banged-up defense, minus four starters, stiffened
in the second half after letting the Eagles Duce Staley run at will
earlier. Staley had career-high 118 yards in the first half but
only 23 in the second half and overtime. &QL;

PLAYING FOR CHARITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Fred Vinson hitting from downtown. . . . it's
FAN-tastic!
</P>
<P>
   Well, not exactly, but in the near-apocalyptic climate of a
locked-out NBA season, a charity game combining All-Stars and
All-Nobodies was enough to sate some fan appetites at UCLA's Pauley
Pavilion on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   No-names such as Vinson played alongside stars like Eddie Jones
in the Chris Mills Charity Game, and it would be charitable indeed
to call this pro basketball.
</P>
<P>
   A team dubbed Mid-Valley _ led by Mills, Tracy Murray and Bryon
Russell _ beat a team dubbed NBA All-Stars _ led by Jones, Kenny
Anderson and Maurice Taylor _ 128-119 in a game that featured a lot
of 3-pointers, minimal officiating and occasional defense.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the estimated crowd of 1,800 seemed to care much.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the game was held to benefit the Mills Youth
Foundation, United Way and the Hollenbeck Youth Center.
Unofficially,, the game benefited locked-out NBA players who need a
public relations boost, and fans who were desperate for pro hoops.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little basketball fix,'' said Armando Olivas, a
27-year-old student, attending with his brother Raymond, 15. ``It
seems like forever since I've seen a basketball game.''
</P>
<P>
   And they will be waiting a while longer, perhaps until next
fall. Negotiations in the NBA's 5{-month-long labor battle fell
apart again Saturday after only 30 minutes, and the two sides did
not speak Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   If an agreement is not reached within the next few weeks, the
1998-99 season is probably dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go ahead and kill it,'' said Russell, the Utah Jazz forward
and San Bernardino native.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me, personally, I hope it ain't a season. What's the use of
starting halfway?'' Russell said. ``If they're going to do
something, they need to do it now. But it doesn't look like it.
What's the use of it.? (Players) can go and make money overseas.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, they'll play for free. The 20 players volunteered their
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Christmas holiday, it's a way of giving back,'' said
Mills, the New York Knicks guard and Los Angeles native who
organized the event. ``Everybody wants to do something . . . give
back to the kids and just put a smile on someone's face.''
</P>
<P>
   The fans who paid $10 to $25 for seats at Pauley got a decent
show and tried to sustain the usual Forum traditions _ roaring at
Jones' every move, booing the Jazz's Russell and heading for the
exits with three minutes left. There was even a celebrity sighting,
though former NFL great Eric Dickerson is no Jack Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
   The sparse crowd, about 10,000 short of a sellout, was
comparable to a handful of other exhibitions NBA players have
staged around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Mills brushed off any notion that public backlash over the
lockout hurt attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what kind of (backlash) you're talking about,''
he said. ``Whatever turnout (we get), if I can give back to anybody
I'll be happy with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The game, which started 30 minutes late, produced some laughable
moments _ from Laker Tony Battie begging a referee for an
illegal-defense call to the public-address announcer bellowing,
``3-pointer, Shea Seals!'' after a shot by Vinson. Seals, a Laker
last season, was not in the building. Vinson, who gets an
occasional 10-day contract and needs the publicity, rushed to the
scorer's table to demand a correction.
</P>
<P>
   The rosters for the game even misspelled four names _ including
that of the event's namesake, listed as ``Cris'' Mills.
</P>
<P>
   But it was as close to NBA basketball as anyone could hope for
at this point. And hope is getting hard to come by.
</P>
<P>
   ``Discouraged,'' Jones said of the failed negotiations. ``If
you're not talking, there's no way in the world you can come up
with any type of compromise . . . so it makes the season look very
dim.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jones is trying to be optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth, in my heart, I believe there will be a
season. It may be a short season, but there will be a season,'' he
said. ``The owners, players, we want to play real bad. . . . I love
to play, that's all I have. To sit out a season, I don't think
that'll help anybody.''

MOORE AHEAD OF HIS TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Archie Moore's nickname was ap propriate. The Mongoose was
always quicker to do something before anybody else.
</P>
<P>
   He was winning titles at a seemingly impossible age long before
George Foreman, or Nolan Ryan, or Warren Moon played into the
middle ages.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, the light-heavyweight champ at 49, always made anything
seem possible. The reason? A willingness to fight on. That was
evident three years ago when Steve Eisner, longtime Valley promoter
and manager, spent a day with Moore.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner was there to visit an old ally in a crazy business.
</P>
<P>
   Boxing is full of wannabes and entourages. They're here today
without a dime and gone tomorrow with somebody else's money. The
parade has come and gone as often as the tide.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner and Moore were always there as either fighters, corner
men, cut men, promoters or managers. They are survivors in the
toughest game of all, and that makes them part of the only family
boxing has ever had.
</P>
<P>
   On the streets of San Diego with the octogenarian Moore, Eisner
was reminded of that bond as they rode around town in Moore's old
Cadillac.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some punks pull alongside,'' said Eisner, who promoted Phoenix
cards over the past 30 years with Moore, including one of Foreman's
initial comeback bouts against Bert Cooper. ``They were giving us
the eye, and Archie rolled down the window and looked right back at
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the stoplight, they're starting to talk at us. `Hey you,
old man, yeah you. Who you lookin' at? I'm talking to you, old
man.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the next stoplight, Archie tells them: `If you pull that
car over, I'll help you find out what I used to do for a living.'
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the kids suddenly stops talking as though Archie is
somehow familiar. The kid yells: `Better go, cause that guy used to
fight.'
</P>
<P>
   ``They took off. As they did, Archie says: `You know, I wish
they had pulled over.' He was that kind of guy.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a fighter from an era when the best fought each other,
and fought often. There were dues to be paid in those days, unlike
this era, when only guaranteed money is paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oscar De La Hoya and Roy Jones Jr. would have been preliminary
fighters in Archie's day,'' Eisner said. ``Today, kids retire as
millionaires after 40 fights.''
</P>
<P>
   With Moore's death, a link to a different era died. There are
fewer fighters, but more money for the best. Boxing also has been
pushed to the fringes of media attention. It's an oddity that often
embarrasses as much as it entertains. It's hard to take seriously,
perhaps because there just aren't many serious fighters left.
</P>
<P>
   One of the last of a handful died Wednesday. The Mongoose was
84, but, as usual, he went too quickly. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Briefly. . .
</P>
<P>
   Mike Tyson is back at Phoenix's Madison Square Garden after the
announcement last week of his bout against Frans Botha. Contracts
have yet to be filed with the Nevada Athletic Commission.
Speculative reports have Tyson's purse at $30 million, or $15
million per bite on Evander Holyfield's ears.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Carbajal might make a long-awaited comeback in Miami a
week before the Super Bowl. America Presents might put together a
card before next month's game. Carbajal was supposed to fight on a
Super Bowl card in Phoenix a couple of years ago. He withdrew
because of an illness.
</P>
<P>
   Best young prospect has to be Fernando Vargas, who stopped Yory
Boy Campas for the International Boxing Federation's
junior-middleweight title Saturday night. Vargas, 21, is the second
1996 Olympian with a major title. Vargas is also the anti-Oscar.
He's not shy about expressing his dislike for De La Hoya. &QL;

WAVE OF INJURIES WASHES PATRIOTS UNDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette may not agree
with this, but after what happened in the Trans World Dome Sunday
it seems appropriate to say one thing about the New England
Patriots' season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sky is falling! The sky is falling!''
</P>
<P>
   You don't like to be a Chicken Little about these things, but
Sunday's 32-18 loss to the lowly St. Louis Rams had an alarming
sense of foreboding to it and not simply because it dropped the
Patriots back into fourth place in the AFC East. Math being what it
is, they are still alive in the hunt for a wild-card playoff spot,
and in some scenarios even could still win the division title, so
all technically was not lost Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But that is a mathematician's point of view, about which I know
nothing. The math says the Patriots still can finish 10-6, get into
the playoffs, sweep through them, and end up in Miami playing for a
Super Bowl title. That's what the math says.
</P>
<P>
   Like most people who can't balance their checkbook two months in
a row, I ignore math as much as possible. I believe in reality, not
mathematical probabilities, and reality tells me something
different about the Patriots' hopes for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Reality tells me they're dead.
</P>
<P>
   It's over for the Patriots, regardless of what happens against
the San Francisco 49ers next Sunday in Foxborough because a team,
any team, only can take so much, and this one has been asked to
take too much.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries may be part of this violent game and must be ignored
and played through, but there is a limit and the Patriots have
exceeded it. They have shouldered the burden of endless injury and
inflated expectations and fought them both. For a time it appeared
all was lost during their midseason swoon, but they came back, as
they have done often the past few years, and won three in a row to
get back into the race.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a team of men, not machines, and men can only take
so much pressure, and Sunday it became too much to overcome. It was
not simply the loss to the Rams, although that was disheartening
enough. It was the loss of wide receiver Terry Glenn to a broken
ankle and starting fullback Tony Carter to a recurring knee and
ankle sprain and the loss of his backup, rookie Chris Floyd, and
the likely loss of quarterback Drew Bledsoe to a fractured index
finger on his throwing hand that finally has had it after the pins
that were inserted to stabilize it began to do the hula by the end
of the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Surely the Patriots will fight the Niners and the hated Jets the
following weekend, but some things are not meant to be. No matter
how broad your shoulders are there are burdens no one can carry,
and the loss of Glenn, and, effectively if not literally, Bledsoe
coupled with other losses they already were struggling with will
overwhelm their dreams and all their efforts between now and the
end of this long, sad season.
</P>
<P>
   What team could lose its two best offensive players and its two
best defensive players _ as New England now has with linebacker Ted
Johnson and defensive end Willie McGinest already sidelined along
with Glenn and Bledsoe _ and muddle through to the playoffs?
</P>
<P>
   Could the Vikings win without Randy Moss and Randall Cunningham
and John Randle and Dwayne Rudd? Could the Broncos win without John
Elway and Terrell Davis and Bill Romanowski and Neil Smith? How
well would the Jets do without Vinny Testaverde and Keyshawn
Johnson and Aaron Glenn and Mo Lewis? We know what happens to
Atlanta when just quarterback Chris Chandler goes out, so in their
case we don't have to add any other suspects, although throw in a
limping Jamal Anderson and see how you like their chances.
</P>
<P>
   If New England had amassed a big lead in its division maybe it
could survive what has happened, but it has no lead in its
division. What the Patriots have is a hold on fourth place,
trailing the Jets, Dolphins, and Bills. They have a team that fell
again to two games off the lead with two to play, which means they
have no margin for error anymore, no matter what their competitors
do.
</P>
<P>
   They must do only one thing to survive. They must find ways to
win with a team broken at its strongest places and even then they
have to hope there are enough wild-card options to keep them alive.
</P>
<P>
   That is not the way it was supposed to be this season, but then
again Bledsoe wasn't supposed to break his finger, and Glenn wasn't
supposed to break his ankle, and Johnson wasn't supposed to tear
his biceps, and McGinest wasn't supposed to pop his groin, and all
the other players who are important in their own way even if less
noticed weren't supposed to be limping and sore either.
</P>
<P>
   But they did and they are, and so whether you like it or not,
Duke, the sky is falling in Foxborough even if everything's bright
and shiny on Yawkey Way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The momentum we worked so hard to build the last month has
taken a big hit,'' coach Pete Carroll said. ``We made it so hard on
ourselves. The opportunity we let slip away ... the opportunity to
get back on top of our division. We had a chance to do that by
winning today and winning out. I don't know if we'll have that
opportunity again. It's out of our hands now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took a major hit right here. But we don't have the freedom
to give in to it. That's not available to us. What is important to
us at this point is that we have to come back and fight these last
two weeks and get everything we can get out of this season and see
what happens at the end of it.''
</P>
<P>
   What will happen is that it will end with a whimper, not a bang.
It will end in sad defeat, not glorious victory, and it will end
soon because there really is no other option left.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are out of players and out of time. In their
hearts, even they know that now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all sounds good to say other guys have to step up but face
it,'' said linebacker Chris Slade, who has been playing hurt much
of this season himself. ``You gotta go with your best guys to win
for long, and where are our best guys?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to say we're going to play with the other guys, but
injuries are a big part of this game and who wins in it. It's gonna
be tough now. We'll see what this team is made of now.''
</P>
<P>
   What they are made of at the moment are guys on crutches, and
guys in slings, and guys in casts, and guys in splints, and guys in
the tub. They are a broken army of game warriors under siege who
simply have sustained too many casualties to hold out much longer.

BASEBALL HEADED FOR BREAK DOWN? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic

<P>
   NASHVILLE _ No one is coming out and openly saying it, but many
baseball executives quietly believe the game is headed toward an
Armageddon of sorts that will make the last work stoppage, one that
included the cancellation of the World Series, seem like nothing.
</P>
<P>
   `` Baseball America'' magazine assembled a discussion group
during the winter meetings Sunday afternoon to address some of
those problems, highlighted by the growing disparity between clubs
with money and those without.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks managing general partner Jerry Colangelo, one of
the six panelists, said he fully understands the economic problems
that exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that disparity is a problem,'' Colangelo said.
``But I can't solve that problem. I shouldn't be looked at alone as
the problem. It should be the ten or eleven teams that are spending
that should be looked at. I don't think anyone really has an answer
as to how to rectify what's happening. I'm willing to listen,
though.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Alderson, recently hired as an executive vice president in
the commissioner's office, is a strong and vocal opponent to the
growing size of contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The annual summer draft was discussed as a microcosm of the
game's dilemmas. It's no secret that small-market clubs, those that
are supposed to benefit most from the draft, must think before
taking the best players.
</P>
<P>
   With the way signing bonuses for the top picks have skyrocketed
in recent years, there is no way some small-market clubs can afford
to pay the going rate.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, those clubs wind up taking a less-talented player who
won't command the $10 million or so bonuses that J.D. Drew and
Travis Lee have received in recent seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The draft is supposed to allocate talent evenly,'' Alderson
said. ``That's not happening now.''
</P>
<P>
   One topic that seems to have growing interest within the game's
inner circle is the advent of the world-wide draft, similar to the
NBA and NHL.
</P>
<P>
   Players not residing in the United States, Canada or Puerto Rico
are the only ones currently eligible to the draft. All others are
free agents.
</P>
<P>
   The belief among baseball officials is that such a draft will
help even the playing field between the richest clubs and one at
the other end. Suddenly, players such as ``El Duque'' Hernandez,
who was signed by the Yankees as a free agent because he defected
from Cuba, would be subject to the draft.
</P>
<P>
   The way it stands now, the Yankees have received their own first
round draft picks the last two years, plus pitchers Hernandez and
Hideki Irabu.
</P>
<P>
   `What works about sports is not knowing the outcome of the
game,'' Detroit General Man ager Randy Smith said. ``As soon as
that happens, there is no game. We're quietly approach ing that
level.''
</P>
<P>
   And that has a lot of people in the game worried. &QL;

PATRIOTS SPIRITLESS IN ST. LOUIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ There hadn't been so much excitement in St. Louis
since Mark McGwire hit No. 70. There hadn't been so much despair in
New England since ... well ... the last time the Patriots lost a
big game they should have won.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got our asses whipped,'' summed up Todd Collins quite
efficiently following Sunday's 32-18 thumping of the Patriots by
the 4-10 St. Louis Rams. ``We got beat at every phase of the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Chris Slade called his teammates ``flat,''
quarterback Drew Bledsoe said that maybe he needs to sit one out,
and coach Pete Carroll confirmed that the team may have to reassess
Bledsoe's playing status next week vs. the 49ers after the pins
that were implanted at Massachusetts General Hospital Tuesday did
not stabilize the finger, as had been the hope.
</P>
<P>
   WBZ Television's Steve Burton stated on ``Fifth Quarter'' that
team doctors and Bledsoe have decided that he will ``shut it down
next week'' against San Francisco, but team spokesman Stacey James
would not confirm that Sunday night, adding doctors rarely say a
week ahead of time whether a player will suit up.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots, who fell to 8-6, still control their own destiny.
If they beat San Francisco next week and the Jets in the
regular-season finale, they will be in the playoffs at 10-6. The
Patriots hold the head-to-head tie-breaker with Tennessee, which
also could finish 10-6.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe missed about five minutes of the game spanning the end
of the first quarter and the start of the second while in the
locker room having doctors fiddle with the pins and resplint the
finger.
</P>
<P>
   But the quarterback, whose first-quarter interception led to a
Rams touchdown and a quick 10-0 deficit, never really got his
rhythm back. Nor did the rest of the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Lovett Purnell, who replaced Ben Coates at tight end, said
Bledsoe's throws were ``tailing off to the left.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe completed only 11 of 35 passes for 176 yards, with one
touchdown and one interception.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early in the game, the pins started pushing through to the
other side of my fingers,'' Bledsoe said. ``They were poking
through my skin from the other side. We numbed it up, pushed it
back, and I came back in. It was really painful.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, wide receiver Terry Glenn fractured his right ankle in the
second quarter and is out for the season, joining Ted Johnson, who
was lost for the year last week against the Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's ankle was crunched by Todd Lyght when he tried to come
down with a pass on a third-and-15 situation.
</P>
<P>
   With Bledsoe's throws going wild, Glenn out, and Coates
attending his mother's funeral in South Carolina, the Patriots
needed to establish a running game.
</P>
<P>
   They did in a way, with rookie Robert Edwards gaining 196 yards
on 24 carries. He busted loose for runs of 53, 47, 36, and 21 yards
on quick hits off tackle, but he was stuffed when short yardage was
needed.
</P>
<P>
   The first time came early in the second quarter, when Edwards
was stopped for no gain on a third-and-1 from the St. Louis 4-yard
line. After Bledsoe returned, he handed off to Edwards, who was
knocked back for a 1-yard loss, and the Patriots turned the ball
over.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, Edwards, who had run up the middle for a
21-yard gain to the Rams' 2, failed on three attempts to get the
ball in, and the Patriots had to settle for an Adam Vinatieri field
goal that put them up for the first time, 18-17, with 7:49
remaining in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't execute well enough to win the game,'' said Carroll.
``It looks like we ran the ball well because we got some big hunks
of yardage, but when we needed the yards at the goal line, we
couldn't get them. Having to settle for a field goal ... we should
have knocked it in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win, you have to play well. Why didn't we play well? These
guys were jacked up all week. They knew what was at stake. They
were ready to play, but it just didn't happen on the field. The
Rams really mixed it up with their offense and kept us off-balance.
Drew had problems throwing it and I think it's clear what Ben
Coates means to our offense.''
</P>
<P>
   On backup quarterback Scott Zolak's first play, with the
Patriots trailing, 10-3, Zolak dropped back and got drilled by Ray
Agnew, forcing a fumble that was recovered at the Patriots' 11 by
the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   That play didn't lead to points, as a bad hold caused a botched
field goal attempt and gave the Patriots the ball at their 11.
</P>
<P>
   A 41-yard field goal by Vinatieri made it 10-6, but the Rams,
now guided by backup quarterback Steve Bono after Tony Banks
suffered a season-ending knee injury in the first quarter, took
over at their 38 and scored on a June Henley 1-yard run with 4:02
remaining in the second quarter to go up, 17-6. The big play was a
20-yard interference penalty on Steve Israel in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   After the Patriots went three and out, as Glenn got hurt, Henry
Thomas sacked Bono, knocking the ball out of his hands; it was
picked up by Chad Eaton at the Rams' 26.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards accounted for 10 yards on the ground before Bledsoe,
rolling to his right, spotted Purnell in the right corner of the
end zone for 6 points. The Patriots, trailing, 17-12, elected to go
for 2, but Bledsoe's pass intended for Mike Bartrum was knocked
down.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots tried a field goal attempt of 55 yards with 25
seconds remaining in the half. Vinatieri made it with room to
spare, tying Matt Bahr for the longest field goal in team history.
</P>
<P>
   After the Patriots went ahead, 18-17, in the third quarter, Bono
struck on two long passes, then rookie receiver Az-Zahir Hakim
executed a reverse to perfection, taking it around right end to the
end zone from 34 yards out. That was followed by Bono's sneak for a
2-point conversion, making it 25-18.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, punting from his goal line, Tom Tupa, arguably one
of the best in the league, shanked one 18 yards to the New England
33. Henley eventually got in from the 1 to give the Rams the 32-18
lead.

TOBIN'S 4TH DOWN CALL SURPRISING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Coach Vince Tobin knows he went against
conventional wisdom when he bypassed a chip-shot field goal early
in the third quarter Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals had a fourth and 1 at the Eagles' 11 yard line
with the game tied at 10.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of sending Chris Jacke out to break the tie with a field
goal, Tobin went for it on fourth down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we had a good chance to pick up the first down,''
Tobin said. ``The way the first half had gone, I felt we were going
to to need points.''
</P>
<P>
   But running back Mario Bates was stuffed for a 6-yard loss, and
Tobin's decision could have come back to haunt the Cardinals had
they not rallied to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you're a head coach and make those type of decisions,
that might happen,'' Tobin said. ``That's the nature of the
business. You have to live with those decisions and do what's best
for your team.''
</P>
<P>
   But wouldn't it have been best for the team to try to take a
13-10 lead?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to be able to get 1 yard,'' quarterback Jake Plummer
said. ``We have to respond. I know I want that play back. Their
defense was so overloaded on one side, I should have called
timeout. If I kept it, I might have walked in.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Gift touchdown &QL; 
 &QL; 
It took until the 14th game to finally get a defensive touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals entered the game with an NFL-high 32 takeaways,
but they had no scores until safety Tommy Bennett ended the first
quarter by scoring on a 70-yard interception return.
</P>
<P>
   The play came on a zone blitz, and Eagles quarterback Koy Detmer
threw it right to Bennett, who could have walked in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought they were going to throw a quick pass to the
end (Karl Hankton),'' Bennett said. ``I didn't want to make that
much of a move and stay home. I recognized the formation they were
in and dropped back. I made the read, waited for him to throw the
ball and baited him. He (Detmer) threw it right into my arms.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Good timing &QL; 
 &QL; 
At halftime, defensive coordinator Dave McGinnis made a significant
adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   He went to a five-man defensive front after the Eagles' Duce
Staley had rushed for 118 yards and a score in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to give the coaches credit,'' defensive end Simeon
Rice said of the halftime switch. ``It was a good change of pace.
We showed something different, and it took them time to get
adjusted. Actually, they never really did get adjusted.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles, who had 122 yards in the first half, gained only 26
yards on the ground after intermission. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Short shot &QL; 
 &QL; 
Plummer was in position to throw the final block on what could have
been an 83-yard touchdown by running back Adrian Murrell in the
first quarter. Murrell gained 32 yards on the play when Plummer
missed the block on safety Brian Dawkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had a good angle on him,'' Plummer said. ``But he
just sped up. I was trying to cut him. Maybe I should have tried to
just get into him and hold him up. But I've never done much
blocking, maybe only 10 or 12 times in my career.'' &QL;

JAKE PICKS SPOTS  
 MAKES BIG PLAYS IN CRUCIAL SITUATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ This wasn't shaping up as the dominating day that
many believed the Cardinals would need from quarterback Jake
Plummer to beat Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The defensive fronts of both teams were badly nicked by
injuries. It appeared the Cardinals, playing for a playoff spot,
would have to outscore the Eagles, who were playing for nothing
except to avoid being hit by decaying fruit hurled by irate fans.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the way, Plummer did not dominate an Eagles defense that
appeared determined not to let him. Then, Plummer made two big pass
plays to Rob Moore in the drive for the game-winning field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer had been equally erratic in a 23-19 loss the previous
week to the New York Giants, suffering two interceptions and a
fumble as the offense got only three points on three trips inside
the Giants 10-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't much more effective here, the difference being that
Plummer saved his few big plays for the most opportune times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done it all year,'' said Plummer. ``When our backs are
against the wall, we gather around each other and tend to make
things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, a 30-yard pass play to Moore on the second play in
overtime, followed three plays later by a perfectly executed fade
pattern to Moore against a blitz that covered 16 yards to the
Eagles 23. That set up Chris Jacke for the game-winning field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer acknowledged he was delighted to be in that position
during an afternoon in which he:
</P>
<P>
   Overthrew Frank Sanders, who was open in the end zone, and the
Cardinals had to settle for a field goal on their opening drive
after reaching the Eagles 10.
</P>
<P>
   Took a sack that moved the Cardinals out of field-goal range on
a third-down on the second series, forcing a punt.
</P>
<P>
   Underthrew Moore, streaking down the right sideline, leading to
an interception in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Took a third-down sack from the Eagles 27 in the third when he
had time to dump the ball, again taking the team out of field goal
range.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was up and down,'' Plummer said of his 18 of 26 passing for
234 yards and a touchdown. ``I could have made some better throws.
But they weren't giving us much in the passing game. We didn't do
what we wanted to offensively. We only had 17 points in regulation,
and seven of those were by our defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer said the Eagles dropped a safety deep in zone coverage
and took big-play opportunities from receivers. But, it helped open
the running game for Adrian Murrell (season-high 174 rushing yards)
as the Cardinals rolled to 424 total yards, topped this season only
by 480 in a home loss to Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still had too many missed opportunities in the red zone,
just like last week,'' Plummer said. ``Any time you're within range
of scoring points, you've got to capitalize.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer came up big when he had to, though, including
three-for-three passing and a touchdown to Moore that tied the game
at 17 with 8:14 left, and then the passes to Moore in overtime that
positioned the team to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of our offensive line, and their great job of
protection,'' Plummer said. ``Everybody stepped it up at crunch
time.'' &QL;

ASTROS PULL OUT OF BIDDING FOR CLEMENS 
</HEADLINE>
 MEETINGS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE _ There will be no homecoming for Roger Clemens in
Houston. And for the first time since Clemens demanded a trade from
Toronto, Blue Jays general manager Gord Ash conceded that Clemens
still could be with the Blue Jays at the start of next season.
</P>
<P>
   Astros GM Gerry Hunsicker took the highly unusual step of
calling a press conference Sunday to announce that his club,
``absolutely stunned and frankly outraged'' by the contract demands
imposed by Clemens's agents, has withdrawn from the bidding for the
five-time Cy Young Award winner.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros bowed out after hearing this ``mind-boggling''
proposal from Clemens's agents, Alan and Randy Hendricks: Clemens,
due to be paid $16.1 million in the two remaining years of his
contract with the Blue Jays, reportedly asked for a one-year
extension of $27.4 million, which would push his earnings the next
three years to $43.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   That averages to $14.5 million a year, which would make him
second to Kevin Brown, who will average $15 million a year under
the terms of his seven-year, $105 million deal signed Saturday with
the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money for us is prohibitive,'' Hunsicker said. ``There's
absolutely no way we can accommodate him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This industry has some serious problems, especially with the
lunacy we've seen in regard to the escalation of salaries. It will
put some clubs out of business. Already, many clubs can't
compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker said Clemens's demands came unsolicited by Houston
from the Hendrickses in a phone call Saturday to Astros owner
Drayton McLane. ``If we had known this going in, we wouldn't have
had one conversation'' with the Blue Jays about a trade, Hunsicker
said. ``It was implied to us (by the Blue Jays) that it was not an
issue with us. This caught us off-guard.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker said the Astros refuse to restructure a contract as a
condition to making a deal, but claimed that the Hendrickses
informed the team there would be no deal without a restructuring,
and that Clemens had veto power over any deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to have it both ways,'' Hunsicker said. ``They
want to treat him as if Roger was a free agent and pay him
accordingly, and also give up a package of talent commensurate with
acquiring a player of his caliber.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens has told Toronto that he wanted to be traded to a team
closer to his home, and a contender. Asked if Clemens's demands
suggested that what he really wants is more money, Hunsicker said:
``You can draw your own conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays have been soliciting two or three players that are
big-league ready from the teams interested in Clemens, who won 20
or more games in both of his seasons with Toronto. Originally, Ash
said, there were 12-14 teams that made inquiries, including the Red
Sox, according to GM Dan Duquette, who said he made an offer last
week.
</P>
<P>
   That list is down to a handful of clubs, believed to include the
Rangers, Angels, Rockies, and Indians, with the Yankees, as ever,
lurking on the periphery. The Astros, with Clemens living in the
Houston suburb of Katy, looked like an ideal match. They were
defending NL Central Division winners, and had quality players to
offer Toronto in return.
</P>
<P>
   But that scenario blew up Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned for an industry in which more and more people
try to extract the last nickel out of the system,'' Hunsicker said.
``One-upmanship is what it is. We're not in position to compete
with some of this madness.''
</P>
<P>
   But just as Dodgers GM Kevin Malone justified Brown's signing
Saturday by saying that if the Dodgers didn't give him $105
million, someone else would have, Clemens still had his suitors.
Sunday night, Rangers officials met with the Brothers Hendricks.
</P>
<P>
   Ash had said initially that he wanted a trade before the winter
meetings. Then he said he wanted to make a deal before the meetings
end Tuesday. Now? ``This is a no-lose situation for us,'' he said.
``If we trade Roger Clemens, or we don't trade Roger Clemens.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The Christmas gift-buying season is upon us, and
what better for that special person on the list than something that
slices and dices, and makes small work of the biggest jobs?
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Bill Bidwill and the Cardinals, they don't have
to sit and hope they find it under the tree. They traded for it
last off-season, and all it cost them was a third-round draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   There won't be any better deal on the cable TV infomercials than
Adrian Murrell has been for the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, when the Cardinals needed not only to win to stay in
the race for an NFC playoff spot but also to control the ball in
hopes of keeping its battered defense off the field, Murrell rushed
for 174 yards in a 20-17 overtime win over the Eagles. That was his
most since moving west from the New York Jets and the eighth most
ever by a Cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   The three-minute edge in time of possession was critical for the
Cardinals (7-7), who with two more wins will be in the playoffs for
the first time since they moved to Arizona. With one more win, they
will equal the most since they've been in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Murrell's performances since missing the Detroit game Nov. 1
because of a calf injury have resembled those of the two-time
1,000-yard rusher that he is.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the season, his gains were more measurable by the inch
when the Cardinals' line was learning how to play with Murrell and
as a unit, and when early deficits caused the Cardinals to throw
instead of run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone thought when Mario (Bates, signed as a free agent)
and I joined the team that things were going to change overnight
and we'd suddenly be an effective rushing team,'' Murrell said.
``But the thing you have to remember is that those guys up front
are young. They hadn't played much together, and they certainly
hadn't played with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rarely have the Cardinals been in position to hand the ball to a
back 32 times as they did to Murrell at Veterans Stadium, four
carries short of the club record. The magic number for most
featured backs to get into the rhythm of a game is 20 carries, a
plateau Murrell has reached only seven times with his new team.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a growth situation like this, that's big,'' he said.
``There have not always been a lot of opportunities for me to get a
feel for them, or vice versa. When the run-pass ratio is lopsided
toward the pass, it is difficult for the guys up front. There's no
doubt the line has gotten better every week. The last four or five
games, we have been able to run the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Murrell is 48 yards from his third straight 1,000-yard season,
537 of those coming in the past six games. With the maturation of
the line, the Cardinals became a serious playoff contender. The
biggest difference is on first down. With Murrell slicing and
dicing, they have faced far fewer third-and-longs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adrian and our line are now in sync,'' center Aaron Graham
said. ``We have found some plays, a group of plays, that give
Adrian the opportunity to cut back and run to daylight . . . When
you give him the whole field, that's when he is at his best.''
</P>
<P>
   Murrell no longer is to be confused with Leeland McElroy, who
contributed to the Cardinals leading the league in rushing plays
for negative yardage last season. Murrell is averaging 4.6 yards a
carry over this six-game break-out. &QL;

BRUINS' EFFORT HASN'T BEEN CONSISTENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ They entered Saturday night's key matchup against
Buffalo riding an eight-game unbeaten streak (6-0-2). As impressive
as that was, what was masked was how often the Bruins were getting
away with a lousy period here, two lousy periods there, and still
coming up with wins and ties.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Sabres, as the saying goes, the emperor wore no
clothes, and the Bruins were dispatched, 4-1, with Buffalo scoring
three times in the first period to go ahead, 3-0. End of game.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps what is most telling is that coach Pat Burns felt it
necessary to warn his goaltender, Byron Dafoe, that he was in for
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat's come to me in a lot of these games right before and
said, `Be ready the first 10 minutes, guys aren't into it,''' said
Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he should be doing that. We're a talented,
fast-skating team and especially at home, we should be jumping the
gun. We should have teams wondering what's going to come out and we
should buzz them. But Pat's usually right. I can't put a finger on
it. We're all trying to figure it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe was talking about the last three games. Against Vancouver,
the Bruins were fortunate to emerge with a 1-1 tie. Against
Pittsburgh, they were far luckier to beat the Penguins, 2-1.
Against Carolina last Thursday, they escaped with a 3-2 win.They
could have lost any one of those games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat's not happy with us,'' said Dafoe, who skated with his
teammates for 25 minutes early Sunday morning and then was forced
to watch video of the pivotal first period. ``It was a huge game
and we just didn't come out prepared and that has been a bit of a
trend the last few games and I think it finally caught up with us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a good time to sit back and figure out why that's
happening because our schedule doesn't get any easier. We've found
ways to win so we kind of take it lightly. After this, we have to
take a look at why it's happening. It's a sellout, it's a big
division game and we're down, 3-0, after the first period. That's
just not our type of hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got Detroit, Ottawa, and Detroit, so it doesn't get any
easier by any means and we'd better be prepared to start every game
coming up.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns's pet peeve during the stretch was how complicated his
skill players were making the game by looking for the perfect pass.
They'd move the puck well during the power play but either nobody
would shoot or the one extra pass would be picked off by the other
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We seem to think we're always going to get away with a
bang-bang offensive flashy play,'' he said. ``You watch (Buffalo's)
goals and there's no bang-bang designed plays. They put the puck to
the net. It's simple. The game of hockey is simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's teams are so better prepared defensively that you're
not going to get away with things. We have to get more from our
better players of playing basic hockey. Right now they're not and
that's why we're not getting power-play goals. All of a sudden, it
has to be a bang-bang picture play. You're going to have to pay the
price. That's one of the reasons we're not scoring five-on-five
goals that much.''
</P>
<P>
   What's frustrating for the coach is how well his club played in
the second period, when the outcome had been all but determined.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all over them, we were behind them, we were hitting
them, but that's the way you're supposed to play,'' said Burns.
``Ken Belanger put the puck in the corner, he chased it, all of a
sudden he was coming out with the puck because they didn't want to
have part of it. That's the way a Boston Bruin team is supposed to
play and that's the way the Boston Bruins team will play.''
</P>
<P>
   Right wing Rob DiMaio, who has been hindered by an ankle injury
he's been playing on since Nov. 3, said it's been the most
frustrating period for him. He said the only thing that has made it
bearable is that the club has been winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few of these games we've gotten lucky,'' he said. ``We
haven't played great. We had good goaltending. We started slow
against Buffalo and we knew if we got behind on that guy (Dominik
Hasek) and that team, that it's tough to come back against. We dug
our own grave.''

ROBINSON, GATTI STAND TOE TO TOE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY _ For 19 rounds they had beaten each other up. Now
it was nearly over for Arturo Gatti and Ivan Robinson, but before
they engaged in three last minutes of hell, something had to be
said.
</P>
<P>
   As the bell rang Saturday night to open the 10th and final round
of their terrifyingly terrific rematch at the Mark Etess Arena, the
two neighborhood gladiators walked warily to the center of the ring
and faced each other for several long seconds. Tradition demanded
the two touch gloves, but what had gone on between them over those
19 rounds _ stretched over the course of two fights _ demanded
something more and both bravehearts knew it.
</P>
<P>
   So as their gloves touched Gatti and Robinson spontaneously
leaned toward each other and also touched foreheads. It was a
silent acknowledgement that something had passed between them that
no witness soon would forget, a bond that comes only with the loss
of blood without a loss of heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arturo may have that desperate way about him but he earns your
respect and he gives it when it's due,'' Robinson said after he had
been awarded a unanimous decision that came within a deducted point
from Gatti for a low blow in the eighth round from being declared a
draw. ``That was about respect. We were in a clinch in the sixth
round and he said to me, `You're a champion, man. I love you.' I
was thinking, `I'm beating you up. Why you saying that?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night everyone in the crowd of 4,396 except for a judge
named Jean Williams respected what Gatti and Robinson had done. Joe
Pasquale and George Colon gave the nod to Robinson, 95-94, that one
deducted point after two previous warnings from referee Benji
Estevez (and two dozen belt-line blows by Gatti) preventing the
fight from being declared a technical draw. While those cards
accurately reflected what happened, Williams had Robinson a
lopsided 97-92 victor. How that could be in a fight so close many
ringside observers had Gatti winning by a point was difficult to
fathom but easy to overlook because of the nobility of what had
gone on between the two boxers both Saturday night and in their
Aug. 22 fight, which Robinson won by split decision in a war so
fierce the bout has been nominated for fight of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Few men could have taken the punishment Gatti absorbed over
those 10 rounds Saturday night. Fewer still would have stood up to
the pounding to the ribs Robinson faced once Gatti's plight grew
desperate.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Gatti's face would suffer the more obvious damage,
with his left eye bleeding badly and swollen nearly shut, but he
would lose not from the blood on his face but from the ferocity of
that body attack, one so wild and savage that Estevez had little
choice but to deduct a point after Gatti had blasted Robinson so
low it was more likely to cause a thigh bruise than any other
damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Arturo was better than in the first fight and he was
dirtier too,'' Robinson (27-2) said. ``I learned the first fight
that when you hurt Arturo it just makes him mad. It makes him dig
deeper.''
</P>
<P>
   That has been Gatti's modus operandi since his career began and
it not only helped make him the International Boxing Federation
junior lightweight champion for a time but also turned him into a
crowd pleaser.
</P>
<P>
   Gatti (29-4) is now on a three-fight losing streak, having been
cut by Angel Manfredy in the first round of their fight in January
so severely the bout was stopped seven rounds later, and twice
losing to Robinson. Each time it seemed it took less to swell
Gatti's face, which began to puff within 90 seconds of Robinson
hitting it with a solid jab and some stinging combinations Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's battle plan had been to stay so busy that Gatti's
face would be forced to surrender. That it would not do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did my best,'' Gatti said. ``I trained really hard. But I
started too late. Ivan is a great defensive fighter. I had a hard
time connecting my punches on him.''
</P>
<P>
   When the last punches had landed _ fittingly a body shot by
Gatti and a straight right hand to the face by Robinson _ it
mattered little who won. The two victories enhanced Robinson's
career to the point where HBO is trying to schedule a lightweight
title fight for him with either IBF champion Shane Mosley or World
Boxing Council titleholder Caesar Bazan, but Gatti lost no luster
from his defeat.

`CLASS ACT' KENNEDY RIGHTFUL RECIPIENT OF GLORY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 Subs to fix Seahawk record in ninth graph   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ For a split second, Cortez Kennedy thought he'd better
just fall on the football.
</P>
<P>
   It was bouncing on the turf below him, punched loose from the
hands of San Diego rookie/punk quarterback Ryan Leaf, who was
making a desperation appearance at the Kingdome thanks to a Seahawk
defense hell-bent on making the Chargers pay for every rotten thing
the Seahawks have experienced this season.
</P>
<P>
   That is why when Kennedy saw the ball skittering under his giant
feet, his eyes grew huge.
</P>
<P>
   The ball looked as big and juicy as a porterhouse. And Lord
knows how good a steak looks to a 306-pound defensive tackle _
impossible to resist.
</P>
<P>
   So at that very moment, with the Hawks already leading the
Chargers at the start of the fourth quarter and the game gone awry
with interceptions and turnovers, Kennedy thought about falling on
the ball. But then the man called Tez got a better idea.
</P>
<P>
   He decided he was gonna run. Just run, baby, all the way to the
promised land.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my first touchdown ever, ever in life,'' Kennedy said
after the 38-17 Seahawk win _ a game nearly as hysterical as it was
historical, because quarterbacks Jon Kitna, Craig Whelihan and Leaf
appeared to have read the wrong rule book.
</P>
<P>
   The point of the game is to put the ball into the hands of your
own teammates, not the other guys'.
</P>
<P>
   Kitna was picked off three times, but the Hawks victimized Leaf
and Whelihan seven times _ twice for touchdowns. Then there was the
exclamation point.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's 39-yard touchdown gambol was the 12th Seahawk
touchdown off turnover or kick returns this season, setting an NFL
record.
</P>
<P>
   Tez, his teammates and the chipper Kingdome crowd ate up the
sight of the big man rumbling to glory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the greatest feelings in the world,'' Kennedy
said. ``At first I thought (Seahawk corner) Fred Thomas was one of
the Chargers. I thought I'd better put my hand on the ball and fall
down. But then I saw it was Fred, so I turned on a little more
speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Speed? Well, not exactly Joey Galloway afterburner stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him he ran like he did when he was a senior at the
University of Miami, when he was 26 years old,'' coach Dennis
Erickson joked.
</P>
<P>
   Tez denied a youthful burst of energy: ``I felt like I was about
40 years old. I wasn't meant to run that fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren Moon was so concerned he greeted Kennedy at the sideline
with an oxygen tank and mask in hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a joke,'' Moon said. ``He needed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was determined, though. He has watched all season as his
defensive partners have racked up nearly as many points as the
Seahawk offense. He figured it was his turn to make the highlights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense has been doing it all year,'' Kennedy said. ``I
was just jumping in there with Chad Brown, Sam Adams and the rest
of those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Except there is a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of 11-year veteran Brian Blades, no current Seahawk has
been with the team longer than Kennedy, a six-time Pro Bowler.
</P>
<P>
   No players outside of Blades and Michael Sinclair knows what
it's like to live through a 2-14 season and play though an
ownership shake-up, then to have payroll increased to $65 million
and still come up short, as the Hawks have this season.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Seahawks lost a game to the Jets. Lost, too, was
any realistic shot at the playoffs _ thanks in large part to a
terrible call on Vinny Testaverde's quarterback draw.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was on the line that Sunday. He tripped up Testaverde.
It was Kennedy's tackle and safety Jay Bellamy's crushing hit on
Testaverde that should have sealed the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that bitter taste stayed with us strong and hard all
week,'' Bellamy said. ``We talked about it this week. We talked
about it during our meeting (Saturday night).
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to show everyone the way this defense could respond
to a game like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hence, all the pass rushes Sunday. All the pressure, all the
picks, and then the exclamation point touchdown run by the
nine-year veteran.
</P>
<P>
   It won't make up for a season gone bust. It won't make it easier
for Erickson to keep his job, though surely the Hawk defense is
showing there is no quit this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could not have been scripted any more perfectly than to
have a class act like Cortez make such a great play worthy of
recognition for the entire team, for the entire defense,''
defensive coordinator Greg McMackin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are going to be remembered for something, it's just
really fitting for it to be Cortez to make the big play. He's been
a class act. When we came here, he was the cornerstone we built our
defense on.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the cornerstone decided to run. What a funny, wonderful,
excellent call.

JETTING INTO THE PLAYOFFS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ For a second, but only a second, he allowed himself to
enjoy the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``From 1-15 to the tournament in two years isn't bad,'' said
Jets coach Bill Parcells Sunday night. ``It's great to be in the
playoffs ... but now we've got a real big game in Buffalo
(Saturday).''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes before, Parcells and his Jets had stunned the Miami
Dolphins, 21-16, to gain a playoff spot with two games remaining in
the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   First place in the AFC East will be up for grabs Saturday when
the Jets travel to Buffalo. With a win in either of its two final
games (the Jets finish by hosting the Patriots), New York will win
its division for the first time since 1969.
</P>
<P>
   If they win both, with Jacksonville losing Sunday, the Jets
could wind up with the second-best record in the AFC and get a
first-round bye.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vinny Testaverde played a big game for us,'' said Jets wide
receiver Keyshawn Johnson. ``This game was very important to him.
He wanted it bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory really belonged to the Jets' defense, which
pressured Dan Marino like he seldom has been on his home field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knocked him down a lot tonight,'' said Parcells. ``We got
after him all night.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets scored on a 12-yard touchdown pass from Testaverde to
Wayne Chrebet, a 9-yard run by Curtis Martin, and a crucial 23-yard
fumble return for a touchdown by linebacker Chad Cascadden.
</P>
<P>
   Miami had just 3 points through the first three periods, a
24-yard field goal by Olindo Mare in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Chrebet's grab later in that quarter made it 7-3, Jets, and
Martin's run in the third, on a nifty cutback, made it 14-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran well against them to the outside when we beat them in
New York,'' said Johnson, ``and we had some big plays on the
outside against them tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins scored two fourth-quarter touchdowns, but the last
came with three seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   The crucial sequence in the game came in the fourth, with two
minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
   New York led, 14-10, but Miami had the ball with a good chance
to go downfield and win. That would have been consistent with the
Jets' history in big games, but they did not cough it up this time.
</P>
<P>
   Marino went back to throw from his 33, and linebacker Cascadden
came up the middle on a blitz. Marino was forced to step up in the
pocket, and when he did, nose tackle Ernie Logan slapped the ball
out of his hands. Cascadden picked the ball up and ran untouched
into the end zone to make the score 21-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm upset and frustrated,'' said Marino. ``We were playing at
home and we should have won. No doubt we should have won this game.
Offensively, we were horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our offensive line was banged up,'' said Miami coach Jimmy
Johnson. ``We had trouble protecting Marino and they did a nice job
with their pass coverages. They are a fine football team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to stop their running game,'' said Jets safety
Corwin Brown, ``and we did. And when they threw the ball we had
good pressure. We wanted to make sure we had coverage on McDuffie
in key situations, because Marino likes to go with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino threw 57 times. He completed 30 passes for 321 yards. But
he turned the ball over twice in the fourth period with an
interception and the fumble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been in the playoffs,'' said backup quarterback
Glenn Foley. ``Five years in the league, and this will be my first
time in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How come?'' asked punter John Kidd, a newcomer to the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I've been with the Jets my whole career,'' said Foley
with a smile. ``That's why.''

WITH PIECES MISSING, OFFENSE PUZZLED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ It was clear after only five minutes of Sunday's
game with the Rams that the Patriots were not prepared _ or had not
been prepared _ to take what should have been theirs, a convincing
win over a doormat team.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Carroll's team would not be able to close what should have
been a most-easy deal, a win over arguably the worst team in the
NFL. That was clear from the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about this game,'' said Carroll, ``we knew what the
issues were, you know (the Rams) are a team that is struggling and
you know that we're a team on the rise. We faced all that up, but
we didn't come out to play. This is a hard, hard lesson for us to
learn.''
</P>
<P>
   And it was even clearer five minutes after this loss that tossed
away so much of the hard work and confidence-building of the last
three straight wins, that New England's Season of The Injury now
has crossed a threshold that makes any prospects for success in the
playoffs dim. Terry Glenn's broken ankle was in a cast, Drew
Bledsoe's broken finger was so grisly that he admitted, ``Maybe
it's time to sit down now.''
</P>
<P>
   With Bledsoe no longer defying medical science, not knowing
whether his passes were going to a receiver in St. Louis or to a
fan in Kansas City, and with Glenn gone, and opposing defenses no
longer forced to focus on the speedy wide receiver, Carroll's words
after Sunday's debacle were apt, ``We took a major hit right
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Glenn's season-ending injury, Carroll said, ``That's part of
the disappointment. I was talking last week about how we were
getting stronger and we were coming back and then it turns out that
we took a major hit. We took a major hit and we're just going to
have to overcome it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben Coates's absence Sunday _ his mother died last week and he
was attending to family matters _ obviously played into the
offensive futility. The absence of New England's defense, with no
apparent excuse, added to this whole surreal day.
</P>
<P>
   Tight end Lovett Purnell, who replaced Coates, said Bledsoe's
passes were particularly wayward ``any time he tried to throw to
his left. You could see he was having trouble trying to throw out
to his left. But all of us also could see he showed a lot of
courage.''
</P>
<P>
   As many Patriots have done the last month, but now New England
seems out of healthy bodies for its most important players. When
Glenn went down with his broken ankle late in the first half, said
wide receiver Troy Brown, ``I was praying that it was just a sprain
for Terry. He's been through so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Patriots fans know all too well by now that Glenn is near
irreplaceable ``and I think it's pretty obvious what not having Ben
does to us,'' said Carroll. It's just a fact, the coach went on,
``and we're not making excuses, but Ben is a big-time player that
we count on.''
</P>
<P>
   Coates will be back next week, but Glenn will not. ``It's real
obvious Terry is a great football player when he's out there and he
gives us a dynamic that we don't seem to come up with without him.
I think it's pretty clear that guy does that for us,'' Carroll
said.
</P>
<P>
   He was so unsure of his team that even with the tip of the ball
virtually touching the St. Louis end zone, on a fourth down in the
third quarter, he chose to go for a field goal that gave New
England an 18-17 lead, rather than a fourth try at a touchdown.
Even those 3 points did little to soothe Carroll's soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I didn't feel we were in control with that lead,'' he
said. ``We went ahead, but we went ahead with a field goal. We
should have scored a touchdown there. We didn't take control of the
football game there and they came right back and put it right down
the field on us (for a 25-18 lead).''
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, the Patriots apparently had their best running game
of the season with Robert Edwards gaining 107 yards in the first
quarter alone, 166 by halftime, and 196 (on 24 carries) for the
game. Twice, though, the Patriots could not run the ball in at the
most opportune moment. Edwards foiled on a fourth-and-1 at the Rams
4-yard line on the second play of the second quarter and he was
again stopped an inch or so from the goal line on that
third-quarter drive before Adam Vinatieri's field goal gave the
Patriots the 18-17 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we were running it, we weren't scoring well,''
said Carroll, of his decision to go for 3 points. ``We weren't
running it effectively down there near the end zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, after the Rams romped 79 yards down the field and
scored on a 34-yard reverse by Az-Zahir Hakim and regained the
lead, the Patriots' offense gave up on the run. A sack of Bledsoe
and two wayward passes preceded a horrible 18-yard shank by the
usually reliable Tom Tupa, and the Rams soon had a another TD.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to use all of our guns,'' said Carroll of the move
away from Edwards (the rookie would carry the ball only once the
rest of the game). ``We just wanted to make sure we used all of our
offense to see if we could get moving faster.''
</P>
<P>
   With Coates absent, with Bledsoe unsure of any pass he threw,
with Glenn gone, the feeling of the last month that New England
could come back from a fourth-quarter deficit just was not there.

DEFENSE COULDN'T DIG OUT OF EARLY HOLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ It was a team they should have stopped, especially
after starter Tony Banks was injured in the first quarter and
carted off the field.
</P>
<P>
   But the Patriots' defense gave up too many big plays in Sunday's
32-18 loss to the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   The defense seemed confused at times by an unorthodox St. Louis
offense that had nothing to lose but a little more self-respect.
Instead, the Patriots allowed the offense to jell from the opening
drive of the game, when the Rams went on a nine-play, 51-yard march
that ended with a 48-yard field goal by Jeff Wilkins. After Drew
Bledsoe threw an interception from the Patriot 15, Banks passed to
Az-Zahir Hakim for 9 yards and the touchdown that made it 10-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough when you go out there and you're down, 10-0,'' said
New England safety Willie Clay. ``Things happen and it's been
tough, but it's over now. You can't really cry about it. We gave
(backup Steve) Bono too much time to throw and guys got open.''
</P>
<P>
   Banks, a restricted free agent after the season who may not be a
part of the Rams' plans next year, injured his left knee on the
second play of the Rams' fourth series when Henry Thomas
bull-rushed left guard Fred Miller into the back of Banks's knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to see a young quarterback who is beginning to do
some things in his career suffer an injury like that,'' said
Thomas, who said a few words to Banks before he was carted off the
field. ``But then Bono came in and just made plays for them. They
did a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas called the loss ``definitely disappointing and
heart-wrenching. I'm really out of words right now. What more can I
say?''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas made nine tackles and was credited with all three Patriot
sacks, doing a good job in the middle of the defense. But it's
obvious the Patriots missed Willie McGinest's pass rush and
presence.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas has been playing all season with a sprained right ankle.
Though he got back on the field for the first time in three weeks,
Thomas admitted it hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had (the ankle) shot up and I've played that way for
seven weeks now,'' said Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   With linebacker Ted Johnson gone for the season, Marty Moore,
Todd Collins, and Tedy Bruschi all took turns playing some in the
middle. Moore made only one tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Israel had one interception, but Patriots coach Pete
Carroll said what killed the team were a couple of third-down
conversions. One was a third-and-12 throw from Bono to J.T. Thomas
that went for 21 yards to the Patriots' 34, from where Hakim pulled
off a scoring run on a reverse, and the other came earlier in that
go-ahead drive when Bono hit Hakim on a third-and-9 for a 13-yard
gain to the 47.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we stop them on those it could be a different game,'' said
Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Rams converted 36 percent of their third-down
chances.

EDWARDS RAN INTO TROUBLE AT TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Robert Edwards had a conversation with himself
Sunday. It was a pleasant exchange. It took place at the Trans
World Dome, during halftime of the Patriots-Rams game. After having
part of the dialogue revealed to me, I am convinced of a couple of
things:
</P>
<P>
   1. The football gods clearly socialize with the gods who are
known for irony and role reversal.
</P>
<P>
   2. It is obvious that a statement can be simultaneously true and
false.
</P>
<P>
   After running for 166 yards in one half against the Rams,
Edwards jogged toward the Patriots locker room and told himself,
``They can't stop us.'' He was telling the truth. He was talking
about the way St. Louis defenders often stood as if they were
blue-and-gold safety cones, letting Edwards weave through them with
no resistance. He touched the ball 14 times and averaged 11 yards
each time he touched it. He was the man. He was the bomb. He was
literally old school, running on the Rams like no one had since Jim
Brown in 1957 (237 yards) and Steve Van Buren in '49 (196). He was
in his own sphere, a man juking and cutting on his own planet. As
they like to yelp on TV, ``He could go all the way ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Well, hold it right there. That was one of the problems. Edwards
ran all over the dome's tough carpet. But he could not go all the
way. He had a 53-yard run and a 47-yard run in one half. He had 117
yards in the first quarter. The last time he ran like that in such
a short time was ``probably against Tennessee. I only played two
quarters that game.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be the Tennessee Volunteers of the Southeastern
Conference, not the Tennessee Oilers of the NFL. So this was a
professional breakout for Edwards. But this is why his true
statement was also false: He ran for 196 yards and averaged 8.2
yards a touch, but he often found hell when he tried to gain only 1
yard. Indeed, the Rams could stop him because he could not score.
</P>
<P>
   On the same drive that Edwards ran for 53 yards, the Patriots
kicked a field goal. On the drive that he ran for 47 yards, the
Patriots had to punt. In the third quarter, Edwards ran up the
middle of the field for 21 yards. He got all the way to the 1. The
ball was nearly kissing the goal line. All Edwards had to do was
slip, seemingly, and he would fall in the end zone. It didn't
happen. He ran toward the Ram defenders who had seemed so passive
before and found out that they were suddenly inspired and excited.
The Patriots kicked another field goal. The Patriots eventually
lost, 32-18.
</P>
<P>
   So, yes, the football gods live in a neighborhood that has a
warped sense of humor. Patriot fans have been praying all season
for a running game. They have pointed to a weak rushing attack that
came into Sunday ranked last in the league. They have recited
football cliche, saying something about playoff teams only being
successful when they are able to run the ball. Last week, the
Patriots scarcely had a running game, but still had enough for
Edwards to score and the team to win by 14. Sunday, the gods gave
them a running game. And a 14-point loss.
</P>
<P>
   Across the field from Edwards, a young back named June Henley
was running for the Rams. Edwards had more than twice as many yards
as Henley. He also had twice the yards-per-carry average. But
Henley had two more touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you told me that I'd have that many yards before the game,
I would think that we would be in a pretty good situation,''
Edwards said. He knows they are not in a good situation now. They
lost to a team playing without its starting quarterback, usual
starting running back, and star receiver. They lost to a team that
had won only three of its 13 previous games.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are 8-6 and could easily win their final two games
of the season, against the 49ers and Jets. They also could lose
them and watch the playoffs just like the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're not done yet,'' Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   No, they aren't done. They are simply men who now know how
strange life can look when oddities crash into expectations:
</P>
<P>
   You begin to expect Edwards not to run well, but one day he does
run well and the team loses;
</P>
<P>
   You begin to expect (and hope) that Terry Glenn will not have
hamstring problems, so one day he is not bothered by a hamstring
but is hobbled by a broken right ankle.
</P>
<P>
   You begin to expect the Patriots to shuffle the cornerback
opposite Ty Law, but Steve Israel begins to play very well, like
the man Pete Carroll saw in San Francisco ... and, instead, the
Patriots shuffle middle linebackers when they lose Ted Johnson for
the season.
</P>
<P>
   People like Woody Allen have made movies about bizarre
situations like this. And people like the Patriots _ moviegoers _
have laughed about life's absurdities as they appear on the screen.
But this is no film. It is the Patriots' season. It may be the
story of a team that lost its playoff chances during a Sunday in
St. Louis. That's certainly odd. But it's not funny.

BLEDSOE PUT FINGER ON PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Drew Bledsoe didn't have to see a hand specialist to
know his fractured finger had deserted him Sunday. He just had to
see his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe was warming up behind the Patriots' bench with just over
five minutes to play in the first quarter of a game the St. Louis
Rams already were leading when familiar discomfort suddenly turned
into alarming discouragement.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden things were moving inside his index finger.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden, things that weren't supposed to be moving were
moving.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden, things that were supposed to be anchors had
begun to float and because of it his team had begun to sink.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to take some throws and I felt the pins (that had been
surgically inserted Tuesday to shore up the double fracture) poking
at the skin from the other side,'' Bledsoe said, not long after the
Rams had poked a hole in the Patriots' playoff chances with a
surprising 32-18 victory at the Trans World Dome that dropped them
to 8-6 and back into fourth place in the AFC East.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't where they had been. They weren't where they were
supposed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon neither was Bledsoe. With his team ready to go onto the
field, he rushed to the locker room from behind the bench to have
the pins pushed back into place. Once done, a needle was inserted
and more pain killer was pumped into a finger that was already so
high it should have belonged to a junkie, not a quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   That done, Bledsoe headed back to the field, but before he could
get there he saw a golf cart in a hallway under the stands and Rams
quarterback Tony Banks laid out on the back of it.
</P>
<P>
   As one game continued on the field without them, another was
unfolding under the stands as Bledsoe ran down to console Banks,
who had torn the medial collateral ligament in his knee only
minutes after Bledsoe had left the field.
</P>
<P>
   There they stood, the starting quarterbacks of the Patriots and
Rams in full battle gear, both infirm, both in pain, both watching
while their teams played without them. This was the side of
football few people ever see, the broken warriors standing in the
echoes as their teams fight on without them.
</P>
<P>
   After exchanging brief words with Banks and patting him on the
wrist, Bledsoe ran back down the hallway and out onto the field,
but by the time he came back the omens were mounting against his
team. Scott Zolak had replaced him and been knocked flat on his
back on his first play and the ball went flying. When it was
finally scooped up by Grant Wistrom, it belonged to the Rams at the
Patriots 11 and all seemed to be slipping away from a team that has
been running uphill for two months now.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams would not score in part because it was two plays later
that Banks went out, but nothing was the same for New England after
that because the underpinnings of Bledsoe's fractured finger had
come loose and so had the underpinnings of his team's playoff
hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe quickly was reinserted in the lineup not long after
Banks's replacement, Steve Bono, also fumbled at the Rams 13. New
England would take four cracks at the St. Louis defense from there,
each time handing off to running back Robert Edwards. On the fourth
one, Bledsoe came back in the game but he was not asked to throw
and Edwards was stopped a yard short of a first down. Four plays,
no passes, no points. And so it went.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drew had some problems with his finger again,'' Patriots coach
Pete Carroll said at the conclusion of one of the worst statistical
days of Bledsoe's career, a day when he went 11 for 35, was sacked
four times, threw one interception, and might have thrown several
more if the Rams could catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could tell by the way the ball was flying that it wasn't
flying as good as normal. Your play falls off because the guys you
need aren't there. There's no mystery to it. Our playmakers weren't
all there and all the pressure went on Drew and he was in a bad
way. When his ball wobbles play after play, you know he doesn't
have the control he usually does.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed he did not and it showed when his team needed him most.
Down the stretch, as the Patriots were trying to come back from a
two-touchdown deficit, Bledsoe went 5 for 17. By then the pins in
his finger were sliding around like toddlers on ice skates and he
simply could not control them or the ball, especially when he would
try to throw to his left.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could tell he was gutting it out,'' receiver Troy Brown
said. ``A lot of plays he used to make with ease were difficult for
him. He told me he couldn't throw to his left and for me to stay on
the right side.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see where he had the pins pushing out. His velocity
and accuracy both suffered.''
</P>
<P>
   So did his team. Although Bledsoe played on, he was a sprinter
with a bad foot. A color-blind painter. A mason without a trowel.
Damaged goods.
</P>
<P>
   There was no way he could do his work properly by the end and
when it was over even he seemed to accept that for the first time
after the doctors had worked on the finger again in the trainer's
room and told him the situation had worsened.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not very good,'' Bledsoe admitted. ``Maybe it's time to
sit down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be time to reassess things after today,'' Carroll said.
``The doctors indicated there may be further problems.'' In fact,
Channel 4's Steve Burton stated on ``Fifth Quarter'' that Bledsoe
and team doctors have decided he will sit out Sunday against San
Francisco, although team spokesman Stacey James would not confirm
it Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   That a change in Bledsoe's situation may be needed was obvious
after Sunday.

THIS TIME, GLENN IS DONE FOR GOOD

<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Instead of happiness and joy and a family reunion
and a Patriots victory, Terry Glenn was absolutely where he most
dreaded to be a few minutes after New England lost so miserably to
St. Louis Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn was sitting on a pile of boxes in a hallway of the Trans
World Dome, his ankle in a cast, crutches leaning against a wall,
his heart in his feet, his soul searching for the whys of this most
unlucky of seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted to be out there on the field to help the
chances of our team to win,'' said Glenn, head down more. ``It just
seems that things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   This time it was the injury _ a broken ankle _ that breaks the
spirit as well as the bone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let myself down,'' said the wide receiver. ``But more than
that, I let the whole organization down, including the players,
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   By suffering a broken ankle?
</P>
<P>
   ``They're counting on me to make plays,'' said Glenn, who broke
the ankle with 3:09 left in the first half, on a third-and-15 pass
from Drew Bledsoe. ``But I'm not out ... I mean, we got guys who
can make plays, but when I'm out there, I'm just an extra guy that
can make plays.''
</P>
<P>
   At about this same moment, June Henley was in the locker room of
the Rams, unaware of any of this. And his parents, Charles and Mary
Henley, also the ``parents'' of Glenn, also were unaware of Glenn's
plight, but even more poignantly so.
</P>
<P>
   Henley and Glenn had grown up together in Columbus, Ohio, and
when life's cruel fortune had sent Glenn to the streets after his
mother was murdered, June Henley and his parents took the
13-year-old Glenn into their home and raised him. Sunday was
supposed to be the grandest of reunions, Glenn starring for the
Patriots on the same field as Henley, making his first start at
running back for the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   The two had met on the field before the game ``and I hadn't seen
Terry in months,'' said Henley. ``We talked before the game but it
wasn't about the game. We were just so glad to see each other. It
was a joy.''
</P>
<P>
   And when Glenn was down on the field for long minutes, Henley
hoped for the best. Then, ``I saw him walking off the field,''
Henley said of his ``brother,'' and ``I just thought it was an
ankle sprain.''
</P>
<P>
   But Glenn's ankle was broken, Henley was told. ``Wow ... that's
a bad thing any time you get hurt,'' Henley said. ``I feel bad
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the St. Louis locker room, the feelings were worse. Mary
Henley said, ``When I saw Terry go down, it took everything out of
me. I haven't recovered yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Henleys were notified by the Rams to go to Section 118 ``and
we went there as they said,'' said Charles Henley, wearing a New
England jersey with the number ``88'' on it and the name ``Glenn''
stitched across the back. ``But no one was there. The people down
there told us someone was looking for us,'' but the Henleys never
could make connections so they could see Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they called me, we didn't know where to go,'' said Mary
Henley. ``We never did get to see Terry.'' And both parents went
on, saying they ``were happy June was doing good,'' as Mary Henley
put it, ``but when I saw Terry get hurt, I knew he was in
trouble,'' as Charles Henley put it.
</P>
<P>
   And there, in that hallway across the way, Terry Glenn sat on
those boxes, his crutches and his cast as companions instead of his
parents and brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things were seeming to go in our favor there for a while,''
said Glenn, who had played well the last four weeks since returning
from a hamstring injury. ``But this is hard ... I don't know what
to say anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing he can do, said Glenn, ``is to go home and think
of this situation that occurred and hopefully I can come back
stronger and try it all over again. I mean, that's the only thing
that I really can do.''
</P>
<P>
   In this Season Of The Injury for the Patriots, the injury to
Glenn Sunday was so painfully deja vu, occurring almost exactly the
same as the ankle injury wide receiver Troy Brown suffered six
weeks ago. Even more, said Brown, the pattern Glenn ran Sunday
``was very similar'' to the pattern Brown was running when he got
hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just remember I was going for the ball and somebody was on
my back,'' said Glenn. ``And that guy started bringing me down even
before I really had the ball. And I guess his knee or something
went down on my ankle ... sort of the same thing that happened to
Troy Brown. The exact same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   When Glenn was finally on his feet, and finally had limped to
the sideline, a tableau ensued that described so much of what these
injures had done to Glenn's heart. Glenn insisted on standing near
the team bench, even as team doctors were insisting that he head to
the locker room for X-rays.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn would not go. Then, as Patriot officials called for the
medical cart to transport Glenn to the locker room, he still would
not move.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept telling me I had to go into the locker room to get
X-rays,'' said Glenn, ``but I really didn't want to. I wanted to be
out there on the field to help the chances of our team to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, said Glenn, ``I was in denial ... greatly.''

MANY THINGS WENT ASTRAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ It was the worst series of the day and Tom Tupa just
happened to put the exclamation point on it. It's OK. You could say
that to the Patriot punter's face and he wouldn't disagree with
you. Just don't ask him to explain the science of an 18-yard
blunder.
</P>
<P>
   Tupa will tell you that nothing profound happened at the Trans
World Dome. He tried to kick the football from his 15-yard line
with four minutes remaining in the third quarter. The Patriots
trailed the Rams at the time, 25-18. A typical Tupa punt would have
traveled more than 40 yards. This was atypical. It wobbled badly
toward the right sideline. Distance: 18 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``It went off the side of my foot,'' Tupa explained. ``You can
put that on the list of things that went wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Tupa's punt, the Patriots were having a miserable series.
Drew Bledsoe was sacked for a 9-yard loss and had incompletions
intended for Robert Edwards and Tony Simmons. Next was Tupa's
18-yarder. The Rams needed only five plays (and 60 seconds) to make
things worse. They got a touchdown from running back June Henley,
his second of the day, and led by 14 over the dazed New Englanders.
They would win the game, 32-18.
</P>
<P>
   Some people will wonder if Tupa, a very good punter, had some
type of miscommunication with his teammates. Was the snap high? Was
the crowd noise a distraction? Were his shoes slippery? Was there a
defender in his face who caused confusion?
</P>
<P>
   Nope. Nothing like that. Just a bad punt. Very bad, in fact.
Probably his worst of the year. ``Oh, by far,'' Tupa said of the
worst-punt-of-the-season suggestion. On most days, he receives the
ball cleanly, kicks it cleanly, and walks off the field content. He
couldn't even do that Sunday. A few minutes after his 18-yarder,
Tupa had to come back and kick again. He stood at his 29 and got
off a punt that traveled 60 yards in the air. Unfortunately for
Tupa, the ball came down in the hands of return man Eddie Kennison,
who caught the ball at his 11.
</P>
<P>
   So there was Kennison, dodging Patriots and heading upfield. He
passed the 20. And the 30. And the 40. By that time, there were not
many defenders in his path. The people here, nearly 50,000 of them,
began to get loud with their cheers of anticipation. Only a few men
were in position to tackle Kennison. One of them was Tom Tupa.
Return men like to see that because punters are perceived by many
as associate football players. But Tupa is not that type of punter.
He made the tackle. Had he not, the score would have been 39-18.
</P>
<P>
   Tupa, who is also a talented golfer and basketball player,
likened his punt to a bad golf shot. Sometimes things go astray
without warning. ``I've only had one of these this year,'' Tupa
said. Shortly after saying that, he shrugged and walked out of the
locker room. Some things cannot be explained.

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The only sight of Deion Sanders on the Arrowhead
Stadium field was during pre-game warm-ups when he ran some sprints
and tried a few backpedaling drills. Then, it was over to the
sidelines with a sore toe to watch the latest chapter of a season
growing increasingly painful.
</P>
<P>
   The ranks of visiting spectators from Dallas grew by another one
late in the second quarter when Michael Irvin took a shot in the
back from Dale Carter and wound up hobbling off the field like
either a wounded crab or a very old man, both of which would also
describe the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Another season is coming undone like an oversexed presidency,
and for the second straight year for the Cowboys, December
performance has a great deal in common with the celebration of
Christmas in Cuba _ it's nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   This time, it was a lifeless 20-17 loss to the Chiefs, and the
big question with the Cowboys is no longer whether they can make it
to the playoffs _ though they have not yet clinched a spot _ but if
they can even make it to the end of the regular season without
falling apart in the street like so much twisted metal and used
bolts.
</P>
<P>
   To find one's way from the happy days when the Cowboys were 8-3
and talking about trying to catch up to Atlanta and Minnesota in
the bid for a first-round playoff bye to the current three-game
losing streak, you simply follow the trail of broken pieces and
loose parts.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Ernie Mills is out for the season following
abdominal surgery, guard Everett McIver was lost to knee surgery,
tight end David LaFleur has a sprained knee, running back Chris
Warren has a groin pull, and now Irvin joins the list. That's just
on offense.
</P>
<P>
   The defense, missing Sanders for the third straight game, was
also without cornerback Kevin Smith, who has a bruised back, and in
his spot had Kevin Mathis, who is wearing a cast on a fractured
forearm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Injuries are a part of the game, and I don't believe in using
them as an excuse,'' said Cowboys coach Chan Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   However, injuries are a reality, and it is also a fact of life
that these Cowboys no longer have the depth that used to set them
apart from the rest of the pack back in the Super Bowl days.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '90s, if one piece of the puzzle was missing, there
was always somebody else to plug into the space. But now, the
Cowboys, even in the best of times, are walking the tightrope
between being a better-than-average team with playoff potential if
all goes right to falling over the edge into non-contending
oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   To date, the 8-6 Cowboys are not really sure how good they are
or how far they can go. What's more, they are now only one game up
on 7-7 Arizona in the suddenly re-engaged NFC East race.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the Cowboys have still not beaten a team all year that
has a winning record, and the Chiefs were an underachieving bunch
themselves that did not have to play particularly inspired ball to
win this one.
</P>
<P>
   All it took was for Kansas City coach Marty Schottenheimer to
stop getting fancy and pound the ball down the Cowboys' throat. In
the first half, Chiefs quarterback Rich Gannon threw an ungodly 34
passes and completed only 13, and all that was good for was a 3-3
tie.
</P>
<P>
   After the break, Schottenheimer finally decided to stop trying
to reinvent the wheel and simply handed the ball to Bam Morris. In
the second half, the Chiefs rushed the ball 27 times and threw only
seven passes. Morris looked like a tank rolling through a flower
bed against the Cowboys' defense.
</P>
<P>
   George Teague frequently tried to tackle Morris by grabbing onto
his waist and riding him like a rodeo bull. The result was Teague's
getting constantly thrown. Mathis was bowled over by Morris.
Charlie Williams bounced off Morris like a tenpin being hit by a
bowling ball. These Cowboys were lifeless, maybe heartless, but
mostly helpless.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the time, we were in the right position,'' said
Gailey. ``But we couldn't tackle. You know, you have to be able to
tackle.''
</P>
<P>
   We know. Morris finished the game with 137 yards and a touchdown
on 27 carries, and that meant the Cowboys' offense was going to
have to produce.
</P>
<P>
   After extending its streak without a touchdown to seven straight
quarters, Dallas finally was able to slip into gear in the fourth
period, getting two touchdown passes by Troy Aikman to Patrick
Jeffers and Emmitt Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too little, too late,'' said Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention too little of the front-line talent that can
still win games and make a difference for the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   This is looking more and more like one of those ``replacement''
teams left over from the labor strike of 1987. Remember those
unknowns who came from nowhere and only looked like the Cowboys
because they wore the same uniforms and same stars on their
helmets?
</P>
<P>
   For several years now, the Cowboys' offense has searched
desperately for a complementary receiver to Irvin. On Sunday, the
Cowboys needed somebody to be Irvin himself. They had to look to a
couple of guys named Jeffers and Billy Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Michael went out, Billy and I looked at each other and
said, `Well, somebody has to make some plays,''' Jeffers said.
``But you know, it's tough. Michael is such a playmaker. I mean,
that's his name, Playmaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Cowboys have too few of them, and the wins are getting
as scarce as Santas in downtown Havana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget about how far we can go in the playoffs,'' said Gailey.
``We still have to make them.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, that's not such a sure thing anymore.

WHIPPLE PROVES TRUE TO HIS WORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NATCHITOCHES, La. _ Words were just words, but a common goal had
to be established and affixed to the words. So, when Mark Whipple
first mentioned the words ``national championship'' to his
University of Massachusetts football team at his introductory press
conference last Dec. 16 at Mullins Center, the coach's comments
were met, quite naturally, with some skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   No one doubted Whipple's coaching ability. He had succeeded at
New Haven, taking the Chargers to the Division 2 playoffs in 1992
and '93. And Whipple succeeded during a four-year stint at his alma
mater, Brown, where he compiled a 24-16 record.
</P>
<P>
   It was just that the Minutemen had come off a 2-9 season. And
here was the new guy, newly arrived from the boola-boola Ivy
League, talking about a national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody talks those words at the beginning of every year,
you know?'' said junior left guard Mike Wynne. ``It's like, `We're
going to win the A-10. We're going to win the national
championship,' but coming off 2-9 you had to be like ...''
</P>
<P>
   Skeptical?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, pretty much,'' Wynne said. ``We didn't think it was
going to happen right away, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Or at all, truth be told.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, my reaction was like, `Well, that'd be nice, but
we've got to face reality,''' said sophomore tailback Marcel Shipp.
``We didn't believe we could make it this far in the beginning, but
he kept putting it in our heads that we could do it and the
confidence level on the team just rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we know we can do it. We can do whatever we want to do
and all we have to do is play with confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The 11th-seeded Minutemen (11-3) were brimming with confidence
after scoring a 41-31 semifinal victory over host Northwestern
State in the NCAA Division 1-AA semifinals to earn a ticket to ride
to Chattanooga, Tenn., where UMass will face top-seeded Georgia
Southern (14-0) Saturday at 2 p.m. (EST) in the national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``People may ask, `How are you playing for the national
championship?''' said Whipple, who in his first year has guided
UMass to its second title appearance in 20 years. ``Well, I had all
the (UMass football) schedules changed in the spring and I had them
put all the playoff dates on it, and that's the schedule we give
out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the guys we had a 15-game schedule,'' he added. ``I
told the kids in doubles (during preseason camp), `You have to
practice better than what you've been practicing because I can't
keep going over and over things, because you won't have any legs
and you'll be dead and won't last for a 15-game schedule.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way we're going to run this program. Those are the
things we've talked about with our kids, and the more you talk
about it, the more they believe in it and that's what we've done.''
</P>
<P>
   But did he detect any skepticism among his players when he first
uttered the words ``national championship''?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I don't know,'' Whipple said, shrugging. ``It's just kind
of what I've done. It's what I did at New Haven and it's what I've
done here. We just weren't able to do that at Brown, because we've
got a 10-game season, so this allows people to be the best and lay
it on the line on the field and that's the way it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   In Division 1-AA football, there are no quixotic quartiles or
confounding polls or perplexing permutations on strength of
schedule and such nonsense. The best 16 teams are seeded in a
playoff format and decide the national championship on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we're in, we don't care what we're seeded as long
as we've got a chance to play,'' Whipple said. ``Our goal as
coaches is to make our student-athletes the best people they can
be. Our philosophy is that if we say we're going to make you the
best and we don't shoot for the national championship, then you're
sending a poor message.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Let's go to the replay.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, we are going there by choice, not necessity. We are
going there for another look at what should be the NFL's play of
the year for 1998, an unbelievable, nerve-splitting moment given to
us by a forgotten quarterback and a gangly, frustrated receiver.
</P>
<P>
   And we are going there to take another long, hard look at the
fellas in the middle of all the turbulence and pressure of the
moment _ the officials _ and give them something they haven't
gotten in a long, long time. Credit.
</P>
<P>
   It was a play that finally broke the Broncos, stopped numerous
potential records and had champagne corks popping all across Miami.
Christmas didn't come early for the 1972 Dolphins with the New York
Giants' stunning 20-16 win Sunday over previously undefeated
Denver. New Year's Eve did.
</P>
<P>
   It started with Kent Graham, the rangy, seven-year Giants
veteran you might never have heard of before and, well, shouldn't
have. Before Sunday, Graham had bounced from here to there and back
again, riding his up-and-down NFL career like just another Danny
Kanell. Before Sunday, Graham resembled the great John Elway in
outward appearance only, with his big, toothy smile, a big, burly
body and enough aw-shucks in his demeanor to be a Jethro Bodine
stand-in.
</P>
<P>
   As a scrambler, he was slow and mostly top-heavy, as teammate
Michael Strahan so aptly described him in the giddy Giants locker
room afterward. Explaining the critical 23-yard dash that set up
the game-winner, Strahan said of Graham: ``It looked like his head
was too heavy. Have you seen the size of that thing? This time, he
had to be happy with that big head. He was leaning forward so much,
his head actually caused him to fall about four more yards.''
</P>
<P>
   On this day, Graham was not just Elway-like for four quarters
(21-of-33, 265 yards, two TDs) but was a little of everything. He
was part Kent, as in Clark Kent, and part Graham, as in Otto
Graham.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was unbelievable,'' Giants coach Jim Fassel said. ``He made
all the plays we needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Included was the one you saw over and over again on Sunday's
highlight shows. Graham took the snap out of the shotgun with 57
seconds remaining and the entire NFL world keeping an eye on
Denver's 13-0 record. Like it had all day, the Giants' offensive
line picked up the Broncos' blitz and gave Graham enough time to
float to his right and find Amani Toomer dashing into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   All season, Toomer, frustrated with the scarcity of balls thrown
his way, had been asking for a chance like this. Before the play,
he told Graham, ``Throw it to me, and I'll make you famous.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham lofted the ball high, and Toomer fell through the end
line, cradling the ball as he crashed to the ground and causing
players, coaches and 72,366 fans to gasp and wonder who among the
striped shirts might become infamous.
</P>
<P>
   But none did, and that might have been as important and heroic
as the game, the pass and the catch.
</P>
<P>
   Their names are David Warden and Kirk Dornan, the field judge
and back judge on referee Mike Carey's crew. Considering how NFL
officials have been charged with and indicted for not being able to
make heads or tails of such game-deciding situations this year,
they were under the kind of pressure to which only the Broncos
might have related.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner was planning a conference call this week to
broach the issue of instituting instant replay for the upcoming
playoffs. NFL director of officiating Jerry Seeman was issuing
scathing weekly reports to his crews. In numerous games, officials
were acting like panicked short-timers afraid of their own shadows.
</P>
<P>
   Three times on Sunday, in fact, Carey even felt compelled to
click on his microphone and explain to the crowd why certain calls
were not made. It was a sort of, ``FYI, you shouldn't be booing us
because '' statement rarely seen in NFL games.
</P>
<P>
   But on the decisive play, the zebras earned honors, not horns.
Warden's view was obstructed as Toomer fell to the ground. Warden
did not make a call but immediately jogged toward Dornan, the back
judge, and conferred. Moments later, both signaled touchdown, and
replays indicated the call was, like the play, unbelievably close.
But it was right.
</P>
<P>
   Had the officials blinked, or choked, as they have been wont to
do this season, the repercussions would have been dire and
far-reaching.
</P>
<P>
   Had Denver gone on to win its remaining games, an enormous taint
would have been cast on the greatest winning streak in NFL history.
An enormous uproar would have occurred across the league. An
enormous mountain of pressure would have been heaped atop the one
already there for the guys in the striped shirts.
</P>
<P>
   But as it turned out, there was the marvelous game-winning play
and the right call. Fassel bounced off the field and told the world
that those perfect 1972 Dolphins should ``send some of that
champagne to New York.''
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget to save a couple of swigs for the officials.

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Rocket science turned into weird science Sunday,
depending on who was giving the lecture.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A day of twists and turns began with Astros general manager
Gerry Hunsicker calling a news conference to announce the club was
halting its pursuit of five-time Cy Young Award winner Roger
Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   Late Sunday night, Randy Hendricks, one of Clemens' agents, said
the announcement had been made without the knowledge of Astros
owner Drayton McLane Jr., who indicated the issue may have been put
to rest a bit prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   It still appears the Astros are out of the running for Clemens,
but McLane said he would make a decision today whether to keep
pursuing a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't seem like we're going to be able to do a deal, but
we're certainly going to try,'' McLane said.
</P>
<P>
   That was a much softer assessment of the team's position than
the one Hunsicker had given earlier in the day when he said the
Astros were out of the Clemens sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This came from an official qualification from Roger's agent
that any trade involving Roger would necessitate a restructuring of
his current contract,'' said Hunsicker, adding the Astros and Blue
Jays never agreed on which players would be involved in a potential
trade. ``Philosophically, we're opposed to that, but more
importantly, the agents did give us the terms they would be looking
for and we were shocked; we were just stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a situation where it's hard enough agonizing over the
talent that you may have to give up to trade for a player like
this. But in addition, you have to restructure his contract as if
he were a free agent on the open market and pay him what the elite
pitchers who have just signed over the last month are commanding.
Economically, there's just no way that we can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hendricks was caught off-guard by Hunsicker's comments, and the
situation became more clouded after a conversation between the
Houston-based agent and McLane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drayton called me personally to apologize and to say that this
was not anything he had authorized,'' Hendricks said. ``In my
opinion, this was done by petulant children who resent the fact
that I've been dealing with Drayton and not them. There are some
people over there who have never wanted to see this happen. Why
else would they do this?
</P>
<P>
   ``When I called (McLane) up, he knew nothing about this. I don't
understand why his people feel the need to dress us down in public.
They may resent the fact that I've been dealing with Drayton. I
have not talked to Gerry Hunsicker since July.''
</P>
<P>
   Sources say Clemens, who already is under contract for $16.1
million over the next two seasons, asked the Astros for a new
three-year deal worth $43.5 million with a fourth-year vesting
option worth an additional $15 million. The deal called for a $12
million signing bonus to be spread over the life of the contract,
not to mention the usual list of perks such as hotel suites when
the team is on the road, etc.
</P>
<P>
   The merits of making such a deal were discussed by McLane,
Hunsicker, Astros president Tal Smith and senior vice president Bob
McLaren. A sense of concern arose from that meeting, some of which
was conveyed in Hunsicker's address to a gathering of national
media members.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros are believed to have been willing to part with
outfielder Derek Bell and righthanded pitcher Scott Elarton in a
package to acquire Clemens, but had they met Clemens' salary
demands, the club would have been forced to dump other
high-salaried players to stay within its budget.
</P>
<P>
   Said Hunsicker: ``Quite frankly, I think Roger would agree _ if
he understood what we'd have to do to make room for him _ even
after trading away the talent to secure his services, he wouldn't
be happy with the team we would be left with. Unfortunately, this
looks like the end of the Houston Astros' involvement in attempting
to trade for Roger Clemens.''
</P>
<P>
   Or is it? That all depends on how successful McLane is at
convincing Hendricks to lower the asking price.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really looks doubtful with everything they wanted,'' McLane
said. ``Truthfully, things would have to change a great deal. It's
probably a long shot to get it done, but we're going to look at it
again, and I told Randy I'd get back in touch with him (today).''
</P>
<P>
   The fact the Astros called a news conference to announce they
were discontinuing their efforts to trade for Clemens was unusual.
Then again, it was an unusual day.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's inappropriate and unprofessional,'' Hendricks said.
``For them to respond to me through a news conference is third-rate
and unprofessional. Quite frankly, I'm stunned and shocked that we
would be attacked this way in our own town. We've always had a
respectful relationship with the Astros.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, who has won back-to-back Cy Youngs and American League
pitching triple crowns, asked the Blue Jays to trade him earlier
this month based on a handshake agreement with former team
president Paul Beeston, who told Clemens he would deal him if the
pitcher no longer viewed the club as a contender.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 12 teams originally expressed interest in Clemens,
but the number had dwindled to five as recently as Friday. Some
clubs were turned off by the fact they not only had to reach an
agreement with the Blue Jays on players but also strike a new deal
with Clemens' agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very unusual,'' Hunsicker said. ``Philosophically, we're
opposed to this, because this is a player who is already under
contract, and we're attempting to trade for that player. In
addition to that, the player is suggesting that he also must have
his contract restructured. That's the first time I've ever been
involved in something like that, and quite frankly I can't think of
another circumstance that I can remember where this has happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you compete for someone's services in the free-agent
market, you understand the parameters; it's an open market, and you
can choose to compete or not to compete. When you're trying to
trade for a player, it normally comes down to whether you can
satisfy the club that currently has his services. But this has
become a combination of both; it's kind of like having your cake
and eating it, too. You're not a free agent, but you want to be
treated like a free agent.''
</P>
<P>
   Most likely having found it too costly to acquire a proven No. 1
pitcher _ the Astros also pulled out of the running for Randy
Johnson (four years, $52.4 million from the Diamondbacks) last
month _ the Astros probably will enter next season with their
current cast of players. Hunsicker added All-Star third baseman Ken
Caminiti earlier this offseason, and he hopes to shore up the
bullpen with a righthanded reliever and bolster the bench with
another righthanded hitter.
</P>
<P>
   As for Clemens, the deep-pocketed Rangers and Yankees would
appear to have the best chance of satisfying his demands, along
with the Orioles and Rockies _ two teams that missed out on their
chance to sign a No. 1 starter when Kevin Brown brokered a
seven-year, $105 million contract with the Dodgers.

UNBEATEN UCONN LEAVES AN IMPRESSION

<P>
   STORRS, Conn. _ Another day, another blowout for the University
of Connecticut women's basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday it was the Svet and Swin Show as sophomore Svetlana
Abrosimova and freshman Swin Cash led the way with 20 and 15
points, respectively, as the Huskies rolled over St. John's, 91-51.
Shooting guard Shea Ralph added 14 points in the Big East matchup
before a sold-out crowd of 10,027 at Gampel Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Abrosimova, a 6-foot-2-inch forward, has led the Huskies in
scoring in four of the team's games, including a career-high 39
against UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   UConn, undefeated at 8-0, is ranked No. 1 nationally, while St.
John's fell to 4-7. The Huskies' narrowest margin of victory this
season is 11 points and their largest is 51 against Holy Cross.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's might have been invigorated by its win over Manhattan
Friday night. Instead, the Red Storm seemed exhausted and couldn't
put up much of a fight against such a powerhouse. They tied the
score four times in the first five minutes but never grabbed the
lead. In fact, after forward Natasha Johnson made a jumper with 13
minutes to go in the first half, the Red Storm didn't hit a field
goal for the next eight minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The fast-moving defense of UConn _ along with the feistiness of
freshman point guard Keirsten Walters, who scored only 2 points but
came away with four steals _ caused St. John's to miss shot after
shot. The Red Storm shot 30.2 percent from the floor, compared to
57.6 percent for UConn (64 percent in the first half).
</P>
<P>
   St. John's couldn't get off many uncontested shots as the
Huskies pressed them under the baskets and pulled down 45 rebounds
to score 22 points off the fast break. UConn, sparked by a
last-minute 9-0 run, took a 50-28 lead at halftime. From then on,
the Huskies had control.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's senior Ebony Dickinson scored a team-high 13 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never moved the ball well because they pressured us,'' said
St. John's coach Charlene Thomas-Swinson. ``And any time you turn
the ball over 28 times, you know it's going to be a bad day.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, St. John's committed 24 personal fouls, repeatedly sending
UConn to the line to pad its lead.
</P>
<P>
   UConn coach Geno Auriemma, who said he thought the game ``was a
little uneven,'' refused to either gloat over his team's perfect
record or get nervous about an upcoming schedule that includes
meetings against Tennessee, Old Dominion, and Louisiana Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, we'll worry about them when it's time to play them,'' he
said. ``And whatever happens, happens.''

EAGLES STILL AWAITING TAKEOFF

 COLLEGE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WORCESTER _ Al Skinner is too much of a realist to kid himself.
And he is too honest to be glib with the press. In his second year
as Boston College coach, he knows he could not have found anything
positive to point out about the Eagles' 75-45 loss to Massachusetts
Saturday night without the help of an archaeologist.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, he knows such a humiliating defeat could happen
again this season. It could happen a few times.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner, whose team dropped to 2-6 with the loss, knew what he
was walking into this season. He would coach a team with only one
returning starter, Kenny Harley, who averaged just 4.5 points last
season, and a host of others who combined for a total of 5 points
and 4.5 rebounds a game.
</P>
<P>
   He would ask that group, and BC's inexperienced freshmen, to
assume major roles long before they were ready or capable.
</P>
<P>
   And he knew at times the results would be disastrous.
</P>
<P>
   When Skinner was told that his freshmen were the only BC players
to score in the first half of Saturday night's contest, he was
neither encouraged by their effort nor discouraged by his
upperclassmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's a little misleading because the upperclassmen
who have returned, it's not like they were big contributors last
year,'' said Skinner. ``Mike Cotton, he's a junior who sat out last
year. It may even happen again, so it doesn't surprise me. It just
shows that we're just a very young team.''
</P>
<P>
   Skinner, who has been quite candid about his team's woes, said
he was most disappointed by his team's effort Saturday night; a
group that often relies heavily on effort to keep games close
wasn't ready to play.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of the reasons UMass (2-4) recorded its
second-largest margin of victory under third-year coach Bruiser
Flint, and its largest since a 31-point blowout of George
Washington last year. All this despite the fact that the Minutemen
played without 6-foot-10-inch widebody Lari Ketner, who was
suspended for the game for violating team rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we really represented ourselves well on the
mental side,'' said Skinner. ``We have to make sure we execute a
little bit better on that side. I thought we could get some other
opportunities (with Ketner out). But in order to do that, we have
to play smart, and we didn't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, UMass, which has had its share of struggles this
season, was elated. After four consecutive losses, including three
against teams it expected to beat, it got no surprises _ just a
lopsided victory most everyone anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a big game for our guys, not only to win but to win
with the margin we did,'' said Flint, whose team outrebounded the
Eagles, 48-32, marking only the second time this season UMass has
won the battle of the boards. ``We'll get guys to relax now and
feel good about themselves. We needed this game, we needed this
game big.''
</P>
<P>
   Both teams have three games before the new year. The Minutemen
travel to Villanova Tuesday night to play a team Flint says is
taller than UMass _ one that has six players 6-8 or taller.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only good thing about it is (Villanova center) Rafal Bigus
was Lari's biggest rival in Philly when they were in high school,
and (Villanova forward) Malik Allen was (UMass forward) Ajmal
Basit's biggest rival in high school. So you've got some
interesting challenges out there,'' said Flint.
</P>
<P>
   BC has the week off and hosts Holy Cross Saturday. Skinner said
his unit deserves the week off, for its struggles on the court
against UMass may have had something to do with the fact that
several Eagles took final exams Saturday morning and the team
didn't arrive at the Centrum until a few moments before tip-off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys were up studying last night, they took exams Saturday
morning, and they just weren't into it,'' he said. ``That may have
played part of it, in terms of our preparation, and maybe it's
something we need to avoid in the future.''

   1. SOLDIERS OF FASHION A decade ago, Ralph Lauren made fitted
military-style jackets trimmed with gold buttons and braid. In the
current spring collection, he - and other international fashion

long as combat persists, whether it is in Croatia, the Crimea, the
two world wars or post-Cold War scenarios, the demands of the
battlefield affect design on the home front (e.g. Land Rovers,
Cartier tank watches, cardigans, Wellington boots, khaki trench
coats etc .... ) By Julia Reed. From The New York Times Magazine.

   WASHINGTON _ In theory, the independent counsel statute was
supposed to be a legal traffic light, blinking red and green at the
crossroads of law and politics. It would stop frivolous charges
against high-level officials, but serious accusations would be
waved on to an outside prosecutor. In recent days, however, the
statute's already overloaded circuitry seems to have blown a fuse.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints about the law are coming at a critical time: The
statute is due to expire next year, and Democrats and Republicans
are lining to up declare that, after two decades, the law intended
to keep politics out of corruption cases should be allowed to die.
Last week an independent bipartisan commission that included Howard
Baker, the former senator and Reagan administration chief of staff,
and Griffin Bell, the former Carter administration attorney
general, issued a report saying the law doesn't work.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence of breakdown seems to be everywhere. In big-name
independent counsel cases, like Kenneth Starr's $33 million
sex-and-lies impeachment investigation of President Clinton, or
less pricey prosecutions, like Donald Smaltz's unsuccessful $17
million case against former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy,
prosecutors seem to be ending up in bitter controversy or
humiliating defeat.
</P>
<P>
   And even when a scandal seems like a natural candidate for an
independent counsel, involving allegations of serious violations of
federal election law and accusations against a president and vice
president, the law doesn't seem to apply _ at least in the hands of
Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years about 20 independent counsels have been appointed
(some ended their tenure after brief inquiries that were never made
public) to investigate charges against both Republican and
Democratic presidents, Cabinet officers and lesser officials. At
the moment, five independent counsels are still in operation, in
inquiries focused on Clinton and four current or former Cabinet
officers.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic critics cite Starr and Smaltz as prime examples of
what the statute can produce: overzealous inquisitors operating
with limitless budgets and without the usual constraints on Justice
Department prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The critics complain that Starr and Smaltz seemed to be obsessed
by playing cat and mouse with a single quarry, in the process
bullying witnesses and spending years fruitlessly pursuing
investigative trails that career prosecutors would have dropped in
months.
</P>
<P>
   Of course many of the Democrats who are now complaining about
Starr were silent when the Republicans assailed Lawrence Walsh's
four-year independent counsel investigation of the Iran-Contra
affair. But even that inquiry largely failed to hold anyone
criminally liable for the profound constitutional issues at the
heart of the scandal. The inquiry ended abruptly when President
George Bush, after being defeated by Clinton, pulled the plug on
the prosecution by pardoning former Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger and five other former officials on Christmas Eve in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   Some inquiries have never gotten off the ground. Twice in the
last two weeks Ms. Reno has terminated 90-day preliminary inquires
with decisions that cleared Clinton and Vice President Al Gore of
wrongdoing in campaign fund raising. Her decisions made it highly
unlikely that either will ever be investigated by an outside
prosecutor for their role in the 1996 Democratic fund-raising
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Her recent decisions were consistent with her refusals over the
last two years to seek an outside counsel to investigate myriad
charges of campaign finance abuse, overruling both FBI Director
Louis Freeh and Charles La Bella, the former head of her campaign
finance unit. Each had concluded that the evidence required that
the case be sent to an independent prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee, said last week that Ms. Reno's decision was
probably the ``final nail in the coffin of the independent counsel
law.''
</P>
<P>
   If Republicans complain that Ms. Reno has set the standard too
high in the campaign finance case, Democrats complain she has set
it too low in the case of lower-level Clinton administration
officials, who have been its most frequent targets. A case in point
is the investigation of former Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros
over the relatively small issue of whether he lied to the FBI about
how much money he paid his former mistress.
</P>
<P>
   So for whatever reasons recently, the law has been toothless in
cases of possibly serious violations of campaign finance laws but
has been used aggressively to investigate gifts of sports tickets,
payments to a mistress and whether Clinton lied about his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not over yet. Ms. Reno has one more independent counsel
decision. On Nov. 30, faced with a decision on whether to seek an
outside inquiry of Harold Ickes, formerly Clinton's deputy chief of
staff, Ms. Reno got a 60-day extension. At issue is whether Ms.
Ickes lied about his activities on behalf of the teamsters' union
in a labor dispute with a California walnut processor.

FIX THE WHITE HOUSE? SURE, BUT NOT THIS WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My fellow patriots, we must act quickly to prevent $300 million
from being misspent on a huge but misguided renovation of the White
House. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By quickly, I mean that we have only until March 11 to make our
public comments against this knuckle-headed idea. If we are silent,
we will deserve what we get in the way of unsatisfactory changes in
this grand national icon (and petting zoo). Oh, it has too been a
petty zoo. Ask Monica Lewinsky. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The National Park Service recently released the draft of a
20-year plan to change lots of stuff at the White House. Naturally,
the draft plan has a name almost as long as completing the changes
is estimated to take: ``Comprehensive Design Plan for the White
House and President's Park.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Robert G. Stanton, National Park Service director, said _ rather
stuffily, I thought _ that the White House ``must be able to meet
the demands of the 21st century presidency.'' So right there we
learned that having a president in the next century is practically
inevitable. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the plan Stanton tossed out for public comment is woefully
off key. Oh, some of it is all right, I suppose. It proposes, for
instance, ``modernizing its infrastructure,'' and surely that's an
admirable goal, although the contrived wording of it almost
certainly would not have been understood by any president from
Washington through Nixon. (Wasn't it, after all, about 1975 that we
first started having infrastructure?) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But so much of the rest of this White House fix-up plan flies in
the face of what we now know _ and at considerable cost _ about
presidents. So I say let's spend some money on the place, but let's
not ignore the lessons of recent history. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The new plan, for instance, proposes expanding indoor recreation
space for the first family. Oh, come on. How do you think Bill
Clinton got in so much trouble in the first place? Too much indoor
recreation space. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, it might be all right to add some of this kind of space as
long as all the walls and doors are made out of glass so that
whoever is in there recreating can always be seen. But the last
thing this country needs is to make it easier for future presidents
to recreate even more on the job. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The plan also calls for more meeting and storage space. Those
are two more bozo ideas. What happens at White House meetings?
People dream up ways to spend more of our money. What resides in
White House storage space? Piles of reports suggesting more ways to
spend our money. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The White House needs less meeting and storage space, not more.
If you hold a meeting where everyone has to stand up because the
room is so tiny, it won't last very long. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, if you tell people that each employee gets storage
space equal to the size of a shoe box, nobody is going to hang on
to a 40-pound report called ``Proposals for Optimizing the Use of
Tax-Supported Day Schools for Feline-Americans and Other Pets.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you think those renovation ideas are stupid, wait until you
hear about this golden nugget: more space for the press. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, really. Do you want it to be easier for the Washington
press corps to interview itself and breathlessly report its
findings about alleged scandals that nobody cares about? Puh-leeze.
Cut down on press space in the White House and maybe these
reporters will go outdoors and talk to real people. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So send e-mail to white_house_liaison(at)nps.gov or write Draft
Plan/EIS, Office of White House Liaison, 1100 Ohio Drive, S.W.,
Washington, D.C. 20242. And while you're at it, suggest another
paint color, too. Hasn't the place been white long enough? &QL;
</P>
<P>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Picture this for high drama:
</P>
<P>
   All 100 senators are in their seats. In the well of the Senate
is a defense table. President Clinton may or may not be at the
table, but his lawyers are, on the edge of their chairs. Facing
them, at a prosecution table, are Rep. Henry Hyde and a few of his
Republican colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   High on the dais, Chief Justice William Rehnquist leans forward
in the presiding officer's chair and reads solemnly into the
microphone from a slip of paper handed up to him by the Senate
parliamentarian: ``Senators, how say you? Is the respondent,
William Jefferson Clinton, guilty or not guilty? The clerk will
call the roll.''
</P>
<P>
   One after another, as their names are called alphabetically, the
senators rise behind their desks and utter the first words they
have spoken about the matter in public session since the
impeachment trial began. No speeches. No explanation. Just
``guilty'' or ``not guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the way the trial will end _ probably sometime next
summer _ if a majority of the members of the House of
Representatives vote this week to impeach the president on the
accusations recommended by the House Judiciary Committee, and if
the Senate goes forward with a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in and around Congress think it will never get that
far _ that somehow, though no one can say just how, the Senate will
avert a drawn-out legal process that could tie up the country for
months. That might seem logical, since no one imagines that the
Senate will come close to obtaining the two-thirds majority needed
to convict the president and remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   But others _ not just Republican opponents of the president but
also steadfast guardians of the Senate's prerogatives like Robert
C. Byrd, D-W.Va., _ believe that the Senate would be obligated to
try the president if the House voted to impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, nothing about an impeachment trial would be logical, by
ordinary legal standards. This trial would be part law and part
politics, governed partly by the Constitution, partly by ancient
Senate rules and partly by the seat of the pants. In the history of
the nation, there have been only 13 such trials (one of a
president), and only 7 convictions (all of federal judges). The
only trial of a president, in which Andrew Johnson was acquitted by
one vote, was 130 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In all of academia, in all the library stacks, in all the
cubicles and carrels of the Capitol, there is no reference book
that spells out what the impeachment trial of a president would
look like in 1999, and there is no person who considers himself or
herself an absolute authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing to know about a Senate trial of a
president is how much we do not know,'' said Walter Dellinger, a
constitutional scholar and former acting solicitor general. ``We
don't know whether it can be confined in a rational way or whether
it will get out of control and take on a life of its own.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider these anomalies:
</P>
<P>
   _ The rules _ 26 of them _ would essentially be those written
for the Johnson trial in 1868. In that era, there were only 54
senators, in session only a small part of the year and working with
quill pens under gas lamps. But Senate rules are so hard to change
that it is unlikely these would be tinkered with in any meaningful
way.
</P>
<P>
   _ Under the Constitution, the chief justice must preside. (The
Founding Fathers realized it would be a conflict of interest for
the vice president to preside over the Senate in an impeachment
trial of a president.) The chief justice could be overruled on any
matter by a majority vote of the senators. But if a tie vote
occurred, he would cast the tie-breaker.
</P>
<P>
   _ Under the Senate rules, the senators, who think nothing of
speaking for hours on the most mundane topic, would not be allowed
to speak during the trial. To question a witness, they could pass a
note to the chief justice, who would pose the question.
</P>
<P>
   _ All witnesses would testify and all evidence would be
presented in public _ presumably on television, no matter how
salacious and how embarrassing. But the senators' deliberations
would be in closed session. No senator would be allowed to speak
for more than 10 minutes in these sessions on preliminary matters.
When the final verdict was debated, 15 minutes would be allotted
each senator, again behind locked doors.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott insists he is making no plans
for a trial, and there is no evidence to the contrary. To plan
before the House votes to impeach, he says, would be presumptuous.
</P>
<P>
   But hardly anyone who has examined the impeachment process
believes that a trial could be concluded in ``three days to three
weeks,'' as Lott suggested in a recent television interview. Alan
Baron, a Washington lawyer who was special impeachment counsel
during the trials of two federal judges in the 1980s, figures that
if the Senate takes up the case in early January, a trial might be
completed by late summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are,'' Baron cautions, ``on the edge of a real seismic
event.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Clinton would have to be given a month or two to prepare for the
trial, Baron said. Then, he said, there would be months of
pre-trial activity.
</P>
<P>
   The first question to be answered would be whether a vote of
impeachment by the lame-duck 105th Congress would be sufficient for
the Senate to conduct a trial in the new Congress or whether the
new House (with a smaller Republican majority) would have to
impeach the president all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist would rule first on this. His ruling would be subject
to reversal by the senators. Because this is a constitutional
question, the matter would doubtless go next to the Supreme Court _
where the chief justice, of course, presides.
</P>
<P>
   (Paradoxically, Rehnquist comes as close as anyone in the
country to being an expert on impeachment trials. In 1992, he
published a book, ``Grand Inquests,'' on the two most famous
impeachment trials, both of which ended in acquittal _ the Johnson
trial in 1868 and the trial of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase
in 1805.)
</P>
<P>
   Next, motions on other questions would arise. What standard of
proof would be required for conviction _ ``beyond a reasonable
doubt'' as in a criminal trial; ``preponderance of evidence,'' as
in a civil trial, or something completely different? What is the
definition of perjury, the accusation in the first two articles of
impeachment recommended last week by the House Judiciary Committee?
What rules of evidence would apply? For instance, would hearsay
evidence be allowed? Would the president's lawyers and senior
advisers be protected from testifying by attorney-client privilege
and executive privilege? If misconduct by Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr can be proved, should the case be dismissed?
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for a Clinton trial, scores of witnesses would have
to be interviewed and documentary evidence would have to be
reviewed. The prosecution could not rely, as the House Judiciary
Committee did, solely on Starr's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, the trial would be similar to those in
courtrooms. There would be opening statements, presentation of
witnesses and evidence by both sides, cross-examinations, rebuttals
and closing arguments. The witnesses _ Monica Lewinsky, Linda Tripp
and the rest _ would testify in public, under oath, and would be
subjected for the first time to cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution would be supervised by a team of congressmen,
called House managers, led by Hyde. They would function like
district attorneys who oversee cases but leave the courtroom work
to assistants. The organization of the prosecution's case,
questioning of witnesses and opening and closing arguments
presumably would be handled by prosecutors hired from the outside.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's defense would also be conducted by a team of hired
lawyers. Because his defense in an impeachment trial is one of the
president's official duties, the cost would be borne by the
government. The president could choose whether to appear at the
trial and whether to testify himself.
</P>
<P>
   A big difference from a courtroom trial, of course, would be the
nature of the jury. Senators would not represent an impartial jury
of the president's peers. Unlike an ordinary jury, the senators
would decide questions of law as well as fact. And the verdict, no
doubt, would turn more on politics than on evidence. Under the
Constitution, it would require a two-thirds vote of the senators
present to convict the president and remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   The other big qualification to keep in mind is that under the
Senate rules, the trial could be abandoned at any point by a
majority vote. This is how a plea bargain might occur. The senators
could agree to stop the trial if they decided to censure or
otherwise punish the president instead, and if the president agreed
to accept the offer, as he indicated he would on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the question of a Senate impeachment trial was
seriously considered was in August 1974, after the House Judiciary
Committee had voted to recommend the impeachment of President
Richard M. Nixon. The Senate voted to direct its Rules Committee to
examine the procedures and precedents.
</P>
<P>
   Then Nixon resigned. Whatever thought had gone into the matter
was quickly shelved.

months. That might seem logical, since no one imagines that the
Senate will come close to obtaining the two-thirds majority needed
to convict the president and remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   But others _ not just Republican opponents of the president but
also steadfast guardians of the Senate's prerogatives like Robert
C. Byrd, D-W.Va., _ believe that the Senate would be obligated to
try the president if the House voted to impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, nothing about an impeachment trial would be logical, by
ordinary legal standards. This trial would be part law and part
politics, governed partly by the Constitution, partly by ancient
Senate rules and partly by the seat of the pants. In the history of
the nation, there have been only 13 such trials (one of a
president), and only 7 convictions (all of federal judges). The
only trial of a president, in which Andrew Johnson was acquitted by
one vote, was 130 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In all of academia, in all the library stacks, in all the
cubicles and carrels of the Capitol, there is no reference book
that spells out what the impeachment trial of a president would
look like in 1999, and there is no person who considers himself or
herself an absolute authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing to know about a Senate trial of a
president is how much we do not know,'' said Walter Dellinger, a
constitutional scholar and former acting solicitor general. ``We
don't know whether it can be confined in a rational way or whether
it will get out of control and take on a life of its own.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider these anomalies:
</P>
<P>
   _ The rules _ 26 of them _ would essentially be those written
for the Johnson trial in 1868. In that era, there were only 54
senators, in session only a small part of the year and working with
quill pens under gas lamps. But Senate rules are so hard to change
that it is unlikely these would be tinkered with in any meaningful
way.
</P>
<P>
   _ Under the Constitution, the chief justice must preside. (The
Founding Fathers realized it would be a conflict of interest for
the vice president to preside over the Senate in an impeachment
trial of a president.) The chief justice could be overruled on any
matter by a majority vote of the senators. But if a tie vote
occurred, he would cast the tie-breaker.
</P>
<P>
   _ Under the Senate rules, the senators, who think nothing of
speaking for hours on the most mundane topic, would not be allowed
to speak during the trial. To question a witness, they could pass a
note to the chief justice, who would pose the question.
</P>
<P>
   _ All witnesses would testify and all evidence would be
presented in public _ presumably on television, no matter how
salacious and how embarrassing. But the senators' deliberations
would be in closed session. No senator would be allowed to speak
for more than 10 minutes in these sessions on preliminary matters.
When the final verdict was debated, 15 minutes would be allotted
each senator, again behind locked doors.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott insists he is making no plans
for a trial, and there is no evidence to the contrary. To plan
before the House votes to impeach, he says, would be presumptuous.
</P>
<P>
   But hardly anyone who has examined the impeachment process
believes that a trial could be concluded in ``three days to three
weeks,'' as Lott suggested in a recent television interview. Alan
Baron, a Washington lawyer who was special impeachment counsel
during the trials of two federal judges in the 1980s, figures that
if the Senate takes up the case in early January, a trial might be
completed by late summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are,'' Baron cautions, ``on the edge of a real seismic
event.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Clinton would have to be given a month or two to prepare for the
trial, Baron said. Then, he said, there would be months of
pre-trial activity.
</P>
<P>
   The first question to be answered would be whether a vote of
impeachment by the lame-duck 105th Congress would be sufficient for
the Senate to conduct a trial in the new Congress or whether the
new House (with a smaller Republican majority) would have to
impeach the president all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist would rule first on this. His ruling would be subject
to reversal by the senators. Because this is a constitutional
question, the matter would doubtless go next to the Supreme Court _
where the chief justice, of course, presides.
</P>
<P>
   (Paradoxically, Rehnquist comes as close as anyone in the
country to being an expert on impeachment trials. In 1992, he
published a book, ``Grand Inquests,'' on the two most famous
impeachment trials, both of which ended in acquittal _ the Johnson
trial in 1868 and the trial of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase
in 1805.)
</P>
<P>
   Next, motions on other questions would arise. What standard of
proof would be required for conviction _ ``beyond a reasonable
doubt'' as in a criminal trial; ``preponderance of evidence,'' as
in a civil trial, or something completely different? What is the
definition of perjury, the accusation in the first two articles of
impeachment recommended last week by the House Judiciary Committee?
What rules of evidence would apply? For instance, would hearsay
evidence be allowed? Would the president's lawyers and senior
advisers be protected from testifying by attorney-client privilege
and executive privilege? If misconduct by Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr can be proved, should the case be dismissed?
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for a Clinton trial, scores of witnesses would have
to be interviewed and documentary evidence would have to be
reviewed. The prosecution could not rely, as the House Judiciary
Committee did, solely on Starr's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, the trial would be similar to those in
courtrooms. There would be opening statements, presentation of
witnesses and evidence by both sides, cross-examinations, rebuttals
and closing arguments. The witnesses _ Monica Lewinsky, Linda Tripp
and the rest _ would testify in public, under oath, and would be
subjected for the first time to cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution would be supervised by a team of congressmen,
called House managers, led by Hyde. They would function like
district attorneys who oversee cases but leave the courtroom work
to assistants. The organization of the prosecution's case,
questioning of witnesses and opening and closing arguments
presumably would be handled by prosecutors hired from the outside.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's defense would also be conducted by a team of hired
lawyers. Because his defense in an impeachment trial is one of the
president's official duties, the cost would be borne by the
government. The president could choose whether to appear at the
trial and whether to testify himself.
</P>
<P>
   A big difference from a courtroom trial, of course, would be the
nature of the jury. Senators would not represent an impartial jury
of the president's peers. Unlike an ordinary jury, the senators
would decide questions of law as well as fact. And the verdict, no
doubt, would turn more on politics than on evidence. Under the
Constitution, it would require a two-thirds vote of the senators
present to convict the president and remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   The other big qualification to keep in mind is that under the
Senate rules, the trial could be abandoned at any point by a
majority vote. This is how a plea bargain might occur. The senators
could agree to stop the trial if they decided to censure or
otherwise punish the president instead, and if the president agreed
to accept the offer, as he indicated he would on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the question of a Senate impeachment trial was
seriously considered was in August 1974, after the House Judiciary
Committee had voted to recommend the impeachment of President
Richard M. Nixon. The Senate voted to direct its Rules Committee to
examine the procedures and precedents.
</P>
<P>
   Then Nixon resigned. Whatever thought had gone into the matter
was quickly shelved.

   Arms Inspections Yield Mixed Results in Iraq
</P>
<P>
   After a week of surprise inspections in Iraq, United Nations
arms inspectors will most likely give the Iraqis a mixed report
card this week when no-notice searches end and the Security Council
begins to decide whether Saddam Hussein has cooperated sufficiently
to qualify for a broad review of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has said it will wait for the report from Richard
Butler, the head of the inspection commission, before making any
decisions about military action if the Iraqis are found to be in
serious breach of agreements.
</P>

   Iraq has not complied fully. It barred inspectors from the
ruling party offices and refused to disclose the location of some
biological material that was moved during a break in inspections
last month and was suspected of being part of an illegal arms
program.

   Harmonizing by Cell Phone
</P>
<P>
   There's a subtle change in the air at pop and rock concerts
these days. Since the 1960s, matches and lighters have been a
concert staple, held aloft by thousands of audience members during
sentimental ballads or while waiting for encores. But with smoking
no longer allowed at many arenas and concert halls, some of which
even confiscate lighters and cigarettes at the door, pop concerts
have been growing dark.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, a new kind of luminosity has been emerging: the green
glows and flashing red lights of cellular phones. At concerts
around the world, especially in cell phone-friendly cities from Los
Angeles to Hong Kong, audience members can be spotted holding the
gadgets in the air like surrogate lighters.
</P>
<P>
   But they are not trying to make a connection with other members
of the audience, as their brethren were doing with their flames in
the late '60s and '70s. Instead, they are making a connection with
someone else _ sometimes a friend stuck at home who wants to hear
the music, sometimes even with their own answering machine at home.
And sometimes they're just bored and trying to catch up on work or
kill time.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, some in the concert business are wondering whether
the cell phone will become as intrinsic to pop concerts as spilled
beer, loud volumes and souvenir T-shirts in the years to come.

   Put 'Em Up, You Man of Letters
</P>
<P>
   What is art?
</P>
<P>
   No, no, that's far too grand a question. Try this one: If
literature is caught entertaining, should it be tossed
unceremoniously out of the clubhouse?
</P>
<P>
   Or this: Can a man who wears cream-colored suits write real
literature?
</P>
<P>
   The topic, of course: Tom Wolfe's new best-seller ``A Man in
Full,'' which has prompted a testy debate lately among the literary
elite.
</P>
<P>
   John Updike, in The New Yorker, wrote that in spite of its
``grand ambition,'' the novel ``still amounts to entertainment, not
literature.'' And Norman Mailer, in The New York Review of Books,
pronounces that ``it begins to promise that he is ready to become a
great American novelist,'' but that ``at the highest level, it's a
failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Sensing that they were putting him down as a mere journalist,
Wolfe countered, ``You have to come up with things that unaided
imagination doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   And he asked, in cream-colored puzzlement, why ``those old
bones'' would try to shoot down his book.
</P>
<P>
   Why indeed? Updike's own books have clearly proved highly
entertaining to many readers, but that surely doesn't disqualify
them as literature. (Entertain, the dictionary says, means ``to
hold together.'' An entertainer is ``one who shows hospitality.''
But that doesn't mean literature is supposed to fall apart and show
you the door.)
</P>
<P>
   And if Mailer, as a member of the literary elite, is entitled to
judge what reaches ``the highest level,'' a question still arises:
How does one join the literary elite?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe C.P. Snow had the answer when he said that Cambridge dons
are not distinguished men, but merely men who confer distinctions
on each other.

   The 1983 law was the only one of its kind in the country, but
had the court upheld it, the idea would undoubtedly have spread.
Chief Justice William Rehnquist said there was no justification for
the search; once a driver is stopped for speeding, he said, all the
necessary evidence of the offense has been obtained.

   Space Station Opens
</P>
<P>
   The international space station, or at least the first part of
it, opened for business. Robert Cabana, the U.S. commander of the
shuttle Endeavour, and a Russian astronaut, Sergei Krikalev,
entered simultaneously to share the honor of being the first humans
aboard, emphasizing the international nature of the 16-nation, $60
billion venture to build the station over the next five years.

   Harmonizing by Cell Phone
</P>
<P>
   There's a subtle change in the air at pop and rock concerts
these days. Since the 1960s, matches and lighters have been a
concert staple, held aloft by thousands of audience members during
sentimental ballads or while waiting for encores. But with smoking
no longer allowed at many arenas and concert halls, some of which
even confiscate lighters and cigarettes at the door, pop concerts
have been growing dark.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, a new kind of luminosity has been emerging: the green
glows and flashing red lights of cellular phones. At concerts
around the world, especially in cell phone-friendly cities from Los
Angeles to Hong Kong, audience members can be spotted holding the
gadgets in the air like surrogate lighters.
</P>
<P>
   But they are not trying to make a connection with other members
of the audience, as their brethren were doing with their flames in
the late '60s and '70s. Instead, they are making a connection with
someone else _ sometimes a friend stuck at home who wants to hear
the music, sometimes even with their own answering machine at home.
And sometimes they're just bored and trying to catch up on work or
kill time.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, some in the concert business are wondering whether
the cell phone will become as intrinsic to pop concerts as spilled
beer, loud volumes and souvenir T-shirts in the years to come.

   Put 'Em Up, You Man of Letters
</P>
<P>
   What is art?
</P>
<P>
   No, no, that's far too grand a question. Try this one: If
literature is caught entertaining, should it be tossed
unceremoniously out of the clubhouse?
</P>
<P>
   Or this: Can a man who wears cream-colored suits write real
literature?
</P>
<P>
   The topic, of course: Tom Wolfe's new best-seller ``A Man in
Full,'' which has prompted a testy debate lately among the literary
elite.
</P>
<P>
   John Updike, in The New Yorker, wrote that in spite of its
``grand ambition,'' the novel ``still amounts to entertainment, not
literature.'' And Norman Mailer, in The New York Review of Books,
pronounces that ``it begins to promise that he is ready to become a
great American novelist,'' but that ``at the highest level, it's a
failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Sensing that they were putting him down as a mere journalist,
Wolfe countered, ``You have to come up with things that unaided
imagination doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   And he asked, in cream-colored puzzlement, why ``those old
bones'' would try to shoot down his book.
</P>
<P>
   Why indeed? Updike's own books have clearly proved highly
entertaining to many readers, but that surely doesn't disqualify
them as literature. (Entertain, the dictionary says, means ``to
hold together.'' An entertainer is ``one who shows hospitality.''
But that doesn't mean literature is supposed to fall apart and show
you the door.)
</P>
<P>
   And if Mailer, as a member of the literary elite, is entitled to
judge what reaches ``the highest level,'' a question still arises:
How does one join the literary elite?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe C.P. Snow had the answer when he said that Cambridge dons
are not distinguished men, but merely men who confer distinctions
on each other.

for Sunday, Dec. 13, moved Saturday in the `a' category (unless

</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-REVIEW (Washington) _ Nothing about an impeachment trial
would be logical, by ordinary legal standards. It would be part law
and part politics, governed partly by the Constitution, partly by
ancient Senate rules and partly by the seat of the pants. An
in-depth look at what to expect in such a trial. By David E.
Rosenbaum. WITH GRAPHIC.

   IMPEACH-JACKSON-REVIEW (Undated) _ The president's refrain today
is: Don't impeach me; censure me. But back in 1834, the argument
was the other way around: Don't censure me; impeach me. A look at
Andrew Jackson's argument against presidential censure.
</P>
<P>
   TOYS-KIDS-REVIEW (Undated) _ America's children are being buried
in an avalanche of toys. It's partly a function of demographics:
There are fewer children and more adults to dote on them. Fueling
the trend are TV's ceaseless shilling of merchandise, guilt on the
part of working, often absentee parents, clevermarketing of toys as
learning tools, and the inescapable realization that a kid
transfixed by a toy is a kid temporarily not bothering a parent.
Now some professionals fear children are being simultaneously
overstimulated and desensitized by a deluge of misguided love. By
Douglas Martin.
</P>
<P>
   BOYS-WOES-REVIEW (Undated) _ It's getting harder and harder to
be a boy. No one's calling for affirmative action for boys just
yet. But given the fact that girls are becoming an ever-larger
majority at most American colleges, many educators are beginning to
think that boys should get more attention. By Tamar Lewin.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA-DRIVETHRU-REVIEW (Atlanta) _ A look at a proposed
ordinance to ban the construction of new drive-through windows in
Atlanta, the national leader in `autodependency.' Under thes bill,
the city would effectively declare an end to more convenient but
bloodless car-bound transactions at banks, fast-food eateries, dry
cleaners, pharmacies, liquor stores and cappucino cafes. By Kevin
Sack.
</P>
<P>
   INDEPENDENT-COUNSELS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Complaints about the
independent counsel law are coming at a critical time: The statute
is due to expire next year, and Democrats and Republicans are
lining to up declare that, after two decades, the law intended to
keep politics out of corruption cases should be allowed to die. By
David Johnston. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   ORGAN-DONORS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Organs: The ultimate gifts.
Studies show that donors fare quite well with a single kidney, and
that their life spans are not shortened. But when a relative needs
an organ, the potential for subtle and not-so-subtle coercion on a
donor in the immediate family is so great that some doctors feel
compelled to offer that member an out, sometimes giving the
impression that the potential donor is not a good match. By David
Stryker.
</P>
<P>
   SPAIN-LATIN-REVIEW (Undated) _ Spain served as a model for its
former Latin American colonies in its transition from dictatorship
to democracy by starting off on a clean slate without
recriminations for the past. Now though, in attempting to put
Chile's ex-dictator Pinochet on trial, Spain is trying to do to
Chile what it did not do to itself. By Alan Riding. (moved in `i'
category).
</P>
<P>
   MAFIA-REVIEW (Undated) _ Today's bookshelves are crowded with
self-help books from celebrated tycoons. If one had been written by

A MOTHER COUNTRY'S ADVICE: DO AS I SAY, NOT AS I DID 
</HEADLINE>
 
 (Repeating for all needing.)   (The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, as many South American countries were
preparing to switch from military to civilian rule, they were
hugely encouraged by Spain's recent passage from dictatorship to
democracy. Just seven years after Francisco Franco's death in 1975,
Spain had elected a socialist government, while its handsome young
prime minister, Felipe Gonzalez, had become a political pinup
throughout Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Less attention was given to a key reason for Spain's successful
transition: Still carrying the scars of civil war and repression,
Spain had decided to address its future by turning the page on its
past. There was no question of punishing the abuses of the Franco
regime. And even then, a military revolt in early 1981, albeit
defused by King Juan Carlos, was a chilling reminder that true
reconciliation would take time.
</P>
<P>
   Here, too, Spain served as something of a model for much of
Latin America _ and, in a particular irony, for Chile. In 1990 the
region duly adapted Spain's gradual transition to its own
circumstances. But now it finds itself at odds with Madrid over a
Spanish prosecutor's efforts to punish the former Chilean dictator,
Gen. Augusto Pinochet, for crimes allegedly committed up to 25
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In most Latin American countries, ``borron y cuenta nueva'' _
``wipe the slate and start afresh'' _ was the preferred approach.
Only in Argentina did some former junta members end up in jail
because only in Argentina was a military regime forced out of
office (after defeat in the 1982 Falklands war). Elsewhere,
including Chile, armies ceded power slowly and reluctantly and,
while special commissions issued ``Never Again'' reports on
assassinations, disappearances and torture, those responsible were
rarely charged.
</P>
<P>
   It seems all the stranger then that Spain should now be trying
to extradite Pinochet to Madrid to face trial for the genocide,
terrorism and torture of Spanish nationals under the rules of
international law.
</P>
<P>
   The 83-year-old general, who was arrested in London in October
at the request of a Spanish judge, appeared before an English
magistrate Friday for a preliminary hearing into Spain's
extradition request after his claims to immunity were rejected.
Thursday, he was formally indicted in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   The case has caused a storm in Chile's relations with both Spain
and Britain, with Pinochet sympathizers calling for reprisals and
warning that his trial could destabilize Chile's new democracy.
Even the country's center-left coalition government has urged that
the former dictator be released, hinting unconvincingly that he
might even be brought to trial once home. And, of course, Chilean
conservatives have remarked that Spain is trying to do to others
what it did not do to itself.
</P>
<P>
   A perhaps stranger twist is that while Spain is now being
applauded by center-left governments and human rights groups for
daring to apply international humanitarian law, this new status is
hardly relished by Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar. Indeed, his
conservative government repeatedly argued before a Madrid court
that Spain had no jurisdiction in the case, although its challenge
was finally rejected by a panel of Spanish high court judges. Last
week the government said it ``wholly respected'' the legal process;
in private, officials said they would prefer it if the general just
flew home.
</P>
<P>
   Aznar's position is not difficult to understand. In the 1980s,
Spain's relations with Latin America were essentially political and
cultural as both sides reached out for international respectability
after years of authoritarianism. But when Latin America's economies
opened up in the 1990s, with many government-owned enterprises
becoming privatized, Spain's focus changed. Suddenly, Spain saw the
region as one big business opportunity. With a rush of investment
in telecommunications, banking, electrical energy, airlines, book
publishing and other areas, Spain's annual direct investment in
Latin America grew to $4.7 billion in 1997 from just $155 million
in 1990, according to the Madrid-based Institute for European-Latin
American Relations.
</P>
<P>
   Chile, which has had the region's fastest economic growth this
decade, was a particularly enticing target for Spanish business
interests. Last month, Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes
estimated that Spain has some $7 billion worth of direct investment
in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   With so much in the balance, then, the last thing that Spain
wants is to be seen to be pulling rank, playing the colonial
master, interfering in the region's affairs in the manner of, well,
the United States, the country that moved quickly to expand its
influence in Latin America after Spain was chased out in the 19th
century. Having left its linguistic and cultural stamp on Latin
America, Spain now prefers to be thought of more as friendly
brother than overbearing mother.
</P>
<P>
   And much of Latin America is keen to reciprocate. It was charmed
by Gonzalez and it routinely mobs King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia
on their frequent visits. It was disappointed when Spain's entry
into the European Union in 1986 did not multiply Latin American
exports to Europe. But Spanish investment still has the singular
advantage of not being American.
</P>
<P>
   Will all this be disturbed by the maverick Spanish judge,
Baltasar Garzon, and his audacious moves against Pinochet? In Chile
perhaps it will be upset temporarily, above all if the extradition
process in Britain drags on for many months. ``The current
situation is going to complicate our lives somewhat from a
political viewpoint, depending on how things play out,'' noted
Rodolfo Martin Villa, chairman of the Spanish utility Endesa, which
has bought a 32-percent share of Enersis, Chile's main distributor
of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Latin America, Spain seems unlikely to be much
affected. Because of Washington's record of intervening politically
or militarily in the region, most Latin American countries react
nervously to threats to their sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the people who are now presidents of several Latin countries
themselves spent time in either jail or exile while military
regimes were in power. At a regional summit last week, they stated
their belief that international law should apply to ``crimes of
international transcendence.''
</P>
<P>
   More relevant, perhaps, with democracy well entrenched in the
region and no imminent perils of military takeovers, Latin American
governments are today far more concerned about managing their
troubled economies than reliving the ideological confrontations of
the 1970s and 1980s. ``Latin America needs capital and Spain has
capital,'' the Spanish writer and sociologist Amando de Miguel
noted, ``so even Chile needs Spain. That's why I don't think
reprisals are very likely.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as Latin American officials and diplomats look to the
future, they have a concern that is more immediate than whether
international justice should be applied to Pinochet or other
retired generals with brutal human rights records in, say,
Argentina, Uruguay, Colombia, El Salvador and Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   It is what can be done to prepare a peaceful transition to
democracy in the region's last remaining undisguised dictatorship,
Cuba. And there, Spain's original model of ``borron y cuenta
nueva'' may again prove useful.

flew home.
</P>
<P>
   Aznar's position is not difficult to understand. In the 1980s,
Spain's relations with Latin America were essentially political and
cultural as both sides reached out for international respectability
after years of authoritarianism. But when Latin America's economies
opened up in the 1990s, with many government-owned enterprises
becoming privatized, Spain's focus changed. Suddenly, Spain saw the
region as one big business opportunity. With a rush of investment
in telecommunications, banking, electrical energy, airlines, book
publishing and other areas, Spain's annual direct investment in
Latin America grew to $4.7 billion in 1997 from just $155 million
in 1990, according to the Madrid-based Institute for European-Latin
American Relations.
</P>
<P>
   Chile, which has had the region's fastest economic growth this
decade, was a particularly enticing target for Spanish business
interests. Last month, Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes
estimated that Spain has some $7 billion worth of direct investment
in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   With so much in the balance, then, the last thing that Spain
wants is to be seen to be pulling rank, playing the colonial
master, interfering in the region's affairs in the manner of, well,
the United States, the country that moved quickly to expand its
influence in Latin America after Spain was chased out in the 19th
century. Having left its linguistic and cultural stamp on Latin
America, Spain now prefers to be thought of more as friendly
brother than overbearing mother.
</P>
<P>
   And much of Latin America is keen to reciprocate. It was charmed
by Gonzalez and it routinely mobs King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia
on their frequent visits. It was disappointed when Spain's entry
into the European Union in 1986 did not multiply Latin American
exports to Europe. But Spanish investment still has the singular
advantage of not being American.
</P>
<P>
   Will all this be disturbed by the maverick Spanish judge,
Baltasar Garzon, and his audacious moves against Pinochet? In Chile
perhaps it will be upset temporarily, above all if the extradition
process in Britain drags on for many months. ``The current
situation is going to complicate our lives somewhat from a
political viewpoint, depending on how things play out,'' noted
Rodolfo Martin Villa, chairman of the Spanish utility Endesa, which
has bought a 32-percent share of Enersis, Chile's main distributor
of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Latin America, Spain seems unlikely to be much
affected. Because of Washington's record of intervening politically
or militarily in the region, most Latin American countries react
nervously to threats to their sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the people who are now presidents of several Latin countries
themselves spent time in either jail or exile while military
regimes were in power. At a regional summit last week, they stated
their belief that international law should apply to ``crimes of
international transcendence.''
</P>
<P>
   More relevant, perhaps, with democracy well entrenched in the
region and no imminent perils of military takeovers, Latin American
governments are today far more concerned about managing their
troubled economies than reliving the ideological confrontations of
the 1970s and 1980s. ``Latin America needs capital and Spain has
capital,'' the Spanish writer and sociologist Amando de Miguel
noted, ``so even Chile needs Spain. That's why I don't think
reprisals are very likely.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as Latin American officials and diplomats look to the
future, they have a concern that is more immediate than whether
international justice should be applied to Pinochet or other
retired generals with brutal human rights records in, say,
Argentina, Uruguay, Colombia, El Salvador and Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   It is what can be done to prepare a peaceful transition to
democracy in the region's last remaining undisguised dictatorship,
Cuba. And there, Spain's original model of ``borron y cuenta
nueva'' may again prove useful.

   ATLANTA _ Opening a debate here Tuesday night, City Councilman
Lee Morris wanted to make one thing clear. ``I don't think
drive-throughs are evil,'' Morris said. ``And I don't think that
folks who use drive-throughs are evil.'' Then he admitted his own
pathetic dependency: ``Uh, I use them myself _ because they're
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The shame of it all.
</P>
<P>
   So began Morris' plea for votes for his proposed ordinance to
ban the construction of new drive-through windows in Atlanta, the
national leader in what Morris refers to as ``autodependency.''
Under his bill, the city would effectively declare an end to more
convenient but bloodless car-bound transactions at banks, fast-food
eateries, dry cleaners, pharmacies, liquor stores and cappucino
cafes. In Atlanta, you can even drive through for chitlins.
</P>
<P>
   To Morris' thinking, autodependency in Atlanta is responsible
for dirty air, traffic congestion, obesity, global warming,
respiratory illness, an epidemic of pedestrian deaths and the
deterioration of community. The Atlanta Regional Commission, a
coalition of local governments, has concluded that Atlantans drive
an average of 33 miles a day, more than residents of any other
major city, and 52 percent more than people in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   After debate, and some lobbying by bankers and burger barons,
the Council rejected Morris' admittedly modest proposal by an 8-5
vote. But the measure spoke to the desperation of this city, and so
many others, trying to control problems like air pollution and
sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   Metropolitan Atlanta has been on the go for nearly 30 years,
emerging unscathed from the civil rights movement. And after more
than doubling its population in that period, to 3.1 million, it
suffers from severe traffic and environmental woes. The area's
leaders, including Gov.-elect Roy Barnes, are increasingly
concerned that ozone days and creeping traffic are becoming an
intractable part of Atlanta's international profile. A poll of
Atlanta business and political leaders this year showed that air
quality had replaced crime and public education as their greatest
concern.
</P>
<P>
   With no mountains or oceans to block Atlanta's growth, farmland
and forest have been swiftly paved into nondescript exurbia. And
despite the relentless expansion of the road system, drivers have
come to expect delays any time and anywhere. The recent addition of
high-occupancy-vehicle lanes on the three Interstate highways
converging in downtown Atlanta have had little noticeable impact.
</P>
<P>
   The city's air quality is considered so hazardous that federal
financing for new highway projects has effectively been frozen.
Studies have found that more than half of the nitrogen oxides in
Atlanta's air comes from cars, and environmental officials project
that pollution will worsen in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Atlanta was founded as the terminus of the Western &AMP;
Atlantic Railroad in 1837, transportation has been central to its
character. Although a few in-town neighborhoods, like Midtown and
Virginia Highlands have retained a pedestrian charm, the area's
suburban design and personality have largely made it a driving
city. While the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority's
trains are clean and efficient, its service area remains limited.
Many of those who do take the trains commute to the stations by
automobile.
</P>
<P>
   Several smaller cities, including Burbank and Sierra Madre,
Calif., and Carrboro, N.C., have imposed limits on drive-through
windows in recent years, although usually to preserve their
character rather than to reduce pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Morris understood that his proposal to ban the construction of
new drive-throughs fell somewhat short of a panacea. Robert King,
president of the Georgia Hospitality &AMP; Travel Association, called
it ``a Band-Aid on a blowout.'' It is not even clear that an idling
car at a drive-through pollutes any more than a car that is stopped
and then started again. But with the hundreds of competing
governments in the metropolitan area flailing in their efforts to
improve air quality, Morris felt it was time to do something,
anything, to get Atlantans out of their cars, to show some
determination to change the city's culture.
</P>
<P>
   He also understood that his measure would cause inconvenience,
especially for the elderly, the handicapped and parents of young
children. But he recalled that it was not so long ago that the
culture deemed it inconvenient to toss soft-drink bottles and
litter into trash cans rather than into rivers and gutters.
</P>
<P>
   His supporters noted that the city and its suburbs had to start
somewhere. ``Everyone says that they're supportive of cleaning up
the air,'' said Councilwoman Debi Starnes. ``Everyone says that
they're supportive of making our city and the world more pedestrian
friendly. And everyone says that they realize that in order to
accomplish those two objectives that we're going to have to do a
lot of little and medium things. There's no one big thing that will
solve these problems. And almost every time one of these little or
medium things comes up, people say, `Well not this little or medium
thing. This won't make that much difference.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, the measure failed, with its opponents
lauding Morris' intentions but condemning his methods. They argued
that the ordinance would place an unreasonable burden on
businesses, would put Atlanta at a competitive disadvantage with
surrounding jurisdictions, would undercut its tax base and would
inconvenience the disabled. Black members of the Council opposed it
unanimously, with many arguing that it would stifle badly needed
development on the city's predominantly black south side.
Councilman Derrick Boazman took a shot at Morris' moralizing by
observing that he had not noticed any donkeys or electric cars in
the City Hall garage that day.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, not surprisingly, found the outcome a bit frustrating.
``Atlanta is known for its rah-rah pro-business attitude,'' he
said. ``And the pursuit of the almighty dollar tends to overwhelm
good public policy.''

ANDREW JACKSON'S ARGUMENT AGAINST CENSURE

   The president's refrain today is: Don't impeach me; censure me.
But back in 1834, the argument was the other way around: Don't
censure me; impeach me.
</P>
<P>
   That was the gist of President Andrew Jackson's written protest
to the Senate against its 26-20 censure of his effort to scuttle
the national bank. In effect, the president was admonishing
legislators for running roughshod over the Constitution. (Does that

   ``The resolution of the Senate is wholly unauthorized by the
Constitution, and in derogation of its entire spirit. It assumes
that a single branch of the legislative department may for the
purposes of a public censure, and without any view to legislation
or impeachment, take up, consider, and decide upon the official
acts of the Executive. . . .
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The President of the United States, therefore, has been by a
majority of his constitutional triers accused and found guilty of
an impeachable offense, but in no part of this proceeding have the
directions of the Constitution been observed.

   NEW YORK _ On Dec. 2, a US Airways passenger jet landing at La
Guardia Airport came within 50 feet of a corporate plane preparing
to take off. It was one of three times in the Northeast this month
in which planes came too close together, which might lead
peak-season passengers to wonder what's going on up there. A lot:
air traffic nationally and in the Northeast has never been more
congested.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, the National Geographic Society mapped the skies above
New York on a typical afternoon for its ``Historical Atlas of the
United States'' and identified about 45 aircraft flying below
14,000 feet, which included most planes headed to or from the three
major airports. Now, The New York Times has taken a more panoramic
snapshot that shows far more traffic overall.
</P>
<P>
   The accompanying map shows the New York region's traffic at 6
p.m. on Oct. 8. The planes at lower altitudes were under the
control of the New York Terminal Radar Approach Control, in
Westbury, N.Y.; the ones at higher altitudes were directed by the
New York Air Route Traffic Control Center, in Ronkonkoma, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Technology has helped air traffic controllers keep pace with
greater congestion, but a controller's job remains highly
stressful. Controllers complain about unreliable and aging
equipment; experts say the Federal Aviation Administration must
find new technology or face gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   If the controllers make a mistake or their computers break down,
an onboard system can warn passenger plane pilots of impending
collisions. Last week, a British Caledonian Boeing 767 and a Delta
L-1011, both bound for Europe, came within a mile of each other
over Long Island, apparently because of computer error, but their
pilots were warned by the on-board anti-collision systems.

   Technology has helped air traffic controllers keep pace with
greater congestion, but a controller's job remains highly
stressful. Controllers complain about unreliable and aging
equipment; experts say the Federal Aviation Administration must
find new technology or face gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   If the controllers make a mistake or their computers break down,
an onboard system can warn passenger plane pilots of impending
collisions. Last week, a British Caledonian Boeing 767 and a Delta
L-1011, both bound for Europe, came within a mile of each other
over Long Island, apparently because of computer error, but their
pilots were warned by the on-board anti-collision systems.

   In many ways, the FBI's file on Frank Sinatra, released last
week, said as much about the agency as it did about the singer. The
descriptions of his effect on teen-age girls were particularly

   `` As a symptom of the state of mind of many young people, I
wish to call to your attention the following incident that occurred
in Detroit last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Sinatra arrived in Detroit around midnight and a group of
bobby-soxers were waiting for him at the airfield. He eluded them
and they then congregated at the stage door of the Downtown Theater
where he was scheduled to give his first performance around 10:00
a.m. on Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The line started forming at around 2:00 a.m. The police started
challenging girls who appeared to be under 16 and tried to send
them home. However, I have been told there was a long line of mere
kids, many of whom carried their lunches, and they remained in line
until the theater opened. Truant Officers started checking the
lines early in the morning and were berated by the girls.
</P>
<P>
   There was widespread indignation on the part of numerous
individuals that I came in contact with and a severe indictment of
the parents of the girls. One individual went so far as to state
that Sinatra should be lynched. . . .''

   Like a grand piano-sized floral arrangement at a mob funeral,
historical respect has finally been laid before the memory of
Charles (Lucky) Luciana, who changed his surname to Luciano as a
rising young mafioso because he somehow thought it was easier to
spell. Last week, Time magazine included the original Godfather,
who consolidated the blood-feuding gangsters of the Prohibition era
into a centrally supervised criminal syndicate that became known as
the Mafia, on its list of the 100 ``most influential business
geniuses of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   Luciano, enthused Time, ``used Standard &AMP; Poor's as much as
Smith &AMP; Wesson'' to succeed in business. But New York City Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, a former prosecutor, took issue, pointing out
that Luciano's rise to the top was based mostly on ``murdering lots
of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his recipe for success, Luciano was undoubtedly the
mob's first modern business visionary. Today's bookshelves are
crowded with self-help books from celebrated tycoons. If Luciano
had written one, here are some lessons he might have offered.

syndicate from behind bars. In 1946, Luciano was paroled for what
was described by Governor Dewey as wartime services to the country
. . . When he was released . . . Luciano was deported to Italy. He
sneaked back to Cuba later that year to run the American syndicate
from that off-shore island. From Cuba, Luciano approved the
execution of Bugsy Siegel for looting the syndicate's money
building the Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas.

feelings. His ideals of life resolved themselves into money to
spend, beautiful women to enjoy, silk underclothes and places to go
in style. His social outlook . . . is dominated by recklessness and
a craving for action. His only asset as a leader consists of his
apparent calmness in times of stress.

   Nevertheless, he continued to maintain active leadership of the

was described by Governor Dewey as wartime services to the country

sneaked back to Cuba later that year to run the American syndicate
from that off-shore island. From Cuba, Luciano approved the
execution of Bugsy Siegel for looting the syndicate's money

GIFTS OF THE HEART MAY MEAN A KIDNEY

   David Patterson has a dilemma over a gift he wants to give
that's a doozy.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson, who is serving 12 years in California State Prison
for burglary and drug convictions, gave a kidney to his daughter,
Renada, three years ago, but the kidney failed. Now Patterson, 38,
wants to give his daughter, who is 16, his remaining kidney and go
on dialysis for the rest of his life, possibly a shortened one.
</P>
<P>
   Giving a living organ is no simple choice. Not only does it have
its physical components, it can be emotionally taxing for both the
giver and the recipient. For many recipients, the organ is the gift
of life.
</P>
<P>
   In Patterson's case, physicians are consulting ethicists and
lawyers on whether the organ transplant violates the Hippocratic
injunction to ``first, do no harm.'' The question may be mooted if
tests show that Renada has developed proteins that would cause her
to reject her father's other kidney.
</P>
<P>
   Living donors account for approximately 17.5 percent of
transplanted organs. But of the 3,695 kidney transplants from live
donors last year, the overwhelming majority came from a family
member or spouse. Studies show that donors fare quite well with a
single kidney, and that their life spans are not shortened.
</P>
<P>
   But when a relative needs an organ, the potential for subtle and
not-so-subtle coercion on a donor in the immediate family is so
great that some doctors feel compelled to offer that member an out,
sometimes giving the impression that the potential donor is not a
good match.
</P>
<P>
   Organ transplants can cement relationships or complicate them.
In Minnesota two years ago, Dorothy Zauhar's brother donated a
kidney to her fiance, Richard McNutt, who later broke off the
engagement and married a nurse in the transplant unit. The Zauhars
sued, alleging ``theft by swindle of a body organ.'' McNutt's
attorney, who denied the allegation, said his client considered the
kidney ``a gift.'' The judge dismissed the case but ordered McNutt
to pay Zauhars' hospital bills.
</P>
<P>
   The motivations of donors who are willing to donate beyond their
family circle are viewed skeptically. One such donation gave new
meaning to the phrase, ``I gave at the office.'' Nancy Nearing, a
42-year-old Virginia mother of two, recently donated a kidney to
her boss, Art Helms, a manager for Applied Management Systems in
Rockville, Md. But she was first interviewed by psychiatrists and
ethicists, who wanted to be sure that hers was a personal gift, not
a professional investment.
</P>
<P>
   The relationships swirling around gifts have long been a
favorite subject of anthropologists. In his famous 1922 study of
Trobriand Islanders, Bronislaw Malinowski studied gift exchanges,
noting that the rule of reciprocity does not underlie every gift to
the same extent. Describing a spectrum ranging from ``pure gifts''
to ``barter,'' Malinowski said that the closer the social ties the
greater likelihood of a pure gift.
</P>
<P>
   Such concepts have been transferred to organ transplants. The
ethos of organ and blood donation in America is premised on the
giving of gifts. It is a federal crime to buy or sell organs for
transplantation.
</P>
<P>
   But few gifts come with no strings attached. The medical
sociologists Renee Fox and Judith Swazey refer to the ``tyranny of
the gift'' in ``The Encyclopedia of Bioethics'' (Free Press, 1978).
</P>
<P>
   The authors write, ``The donor has made the utmost gift; the
recipient has received something that is inherently unrepayable.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to these pressures, transplant professionals often
try to shield the identity of the deceased donors from recipients
lest any social or emotional entanglements arise between donor and
recipient families. The National Marrow Donor Program, which
maintains records on more than 3 million potential donors, strives
for a middle ground. If both the patient and donor wish to meet
after a year, the group will arrange a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some donors become very concerned about how a recipient
fares. One kidney donor committed suicide a few years ago after
sinking into a deep depression when the recipient became ill.
</P>
<P>
   The recipients themselves have their own issues. Earlier this
year, Kevin Harris, who received a kidney from his former college
roommate, said on ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' ``I feel so
unworthy, so completely unworthy of that gift from him.''

HOW BOYS LOST OUT TO GIRL POWER
</HEADLINE>
 
 (Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one's calling for affirmative action for boys just yet.
</P>
<P>
   But given the fact that girls are becoming an ever larger
majority at most American colleges, many educators are beginning to
think boys should get more attention.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, the conventional wisdom _ reinforced by a
steady drumbeat of stories stressing female victimhood _ has been
that girls are shortchanged in school, getting less attention from
their teachers than boys and gradually losing their self-esteem as
they enter adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   By all kinds of measures, though, girls rule in school. They
have better grades, higher reading and writing scores, higher class
ranks and more school honors, and they are more likely than boys to
take Advanced Placement exams in English, social studies and
foreign languages.
</P>
<P>
   Boys are more likely to repeat a grade, drop out, be put in
special education, be diagnosed with learning disabilities and be
put on behavior-modifying medication like Ritalin. As teen-agers,
they are also far more likely than girls to commit suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The myth that the schools shortchange girls is dangerously
wrong because it has diverted policy attention from the group at
genuine education risk _ African-American boys,'' said Judith
Kleinfeld, a University of Alaska professor, in a paper earlier
this year that found that schools put boys at more of a
disadvantage than girls. ``This is the group that scores lowest on
virtually every educational measure. This is the group where an
enormous gap does exist between males and females. But the
African-American gender gap favors females.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea that boys need more help than girls do is slowly
gaining currency nationally. ``Something is changing,'' Ms.
Kleinfeld said. ``Just recently, people are beginning to be willing
to think about boys' problems.''
</P>
<P>
   No one denies that the status of women remains a real issue in
society. Despite the flood of women into business and the
professions over the last two decades, women are underrepresented
in corporate boardrooms, science labs and partnerships at law
firms. And even in school, sexual harassment remains a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Boys still dominate the nation's technical and engineering
schools, and obtain higher scores on many standardized tests _
although those gaps are narrowing.
</P>
<P>
   But some educators say the boys-versus-girls bean-counting has
gone too far, that those gaps have become small enough that they
are unimportant, especially when measured against the very large
racial differences in educational achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're saying that more girls take biology and chemistry, but
uh-oh, there's more boys in physics,'' said Diane Ravitch, a senior
fellow at the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an alarm bell ringing in the night,'' she said.
``What we should be concerned about is the racial disparities.
There's a four-year gap between blacks and whites on the national
tests. The average black 17-year-old scores the same as the average
white 13-year-old. That's a crisis, not gender.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Levine, president of Columbia University's Teachers
College, takes a middle road, stressing that both sexes have unique
problems that schools should address.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not either-or, and we shouldn't always see things as the
crisis du jour,'' he said. ``We can do better by boys. We need to
do a lot better with regard to racial and socioeconomic
differences, and that doesn't mean we shouldn't pay attention to
the special needs of girls.''
</P>
<P>
   The furor over gender equity was kindled in 1992 by the release
of a study by the American Association of University Women, ``How
Schools Shortchange Girls,'' which declared that girls face bias
from preschool through high school in textbooks, tests and
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The association presented the situation as dire. ``This report
brings to light the pervasive inequalities that have made girls
second-class students in America's schools,'' said Alice McKee, the
AAUW Educational Foundation president at the time. ``Girls and boys
enter school roughly equal in ability. Twelve years later, girls
have fallen behind in key areas. Whether one looks at achievement
scores, curriculum design or teacher-student interaction, it's
clear that our schools are shortchanging America's girls.''
</P>
<P>
   The report stimulated debate on teacher training and gender
equity, experiments with single-sex math and science classes and
new interest in girls' schools, including new efforts like the
Young Women's Leadership Academy in New York's Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   But based on extensive re-examination of the AAUW data and
findings, Ms. Kleinfeld's paper found the report shoddy, biased and
simply incorrect. She wrote: ``In the view of elementary and high
school students, the young people who sit in the classroom year
after year and observe what is going on, both boys and girls agree:
Schools favor girls. Teachers think girls are smarter, like being
around them more and hold higher expectations for them.''

</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ravitch also believes that the AAUW report was grounded more
in gender politics than educational reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first AAUW report was just completely wrong,'' she said.
``What was so bizarre is that it came out right at the time that
girls had just overtaken boys in almost every area. It might have
been the right story 20 years earlier, but coming out when it did,
it was like calling a wedding a funeral. It was phony, it dominated
the news for years and it was harmful. There were all these special
programs put in place for girls, and no one paid any attention to
boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Janice Weinman, executive director of the AAUW, defends the
report. `` `How Schools Shortchange Girls' was a wake-up call,''
she said. ``I think it's because of that report that girls made
progress in math and science.''
</P>
<P>
   Others have also found it valuable.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my mind, it was a good thing that the AAUW got us to worry
about girls, because there is no question in my mind that women in
classrooms were treated with less respect and interest than boys,''
said Frank Newman, president of the Education Commission of the
States, a policy group in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boy-girl problem is much deeper than education, it's a
civic responsibility problem. When I was a university president,
dealing with discipline cases where someone was being expelled or
suspended, it was always boys. I don't remember a single girl. We
need to teach boys responsibility. That's why sexual harassment is
still a problem. Boy-girl differences are still important, but they
pale in comparison to the big differences in education, which are
due to race and class.''
</P>
<P>
   This fall, the AAUW issued a follow-up report, talking about
girls' gains, as well as the areas where boys lag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree, the issue shouldn't be boys versus girls,'' Ms.
Weinman said. ``It should be equity and excellence for everyone.
And we're not stuck in the same groove, singing the same song. Our
follow-up report said number one, that girls had made real
progress; number two, that boys had not made that kind of progress
in the fields where they lag, and number three, that we should look
at subgroups, like Hispanic girls or African-American boys, to
determine where there are particular needs.''
</P>
<P>
   But even the new report emphasized a growing technology gap that
leaves girls less equipped for skilled computer jobs, calling
technology the new boy's club.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a significant problem, and we're very concerned about
it,'' Ms. Weinman said. ``And it's true, we're the American
Association of University Women, and our mission is to look at
education for girls and women.''

<P>
   ``That first AAUW report was just completely wrong,'' she said.
``What was so bizarre is that it came out right at the time that
girls had just overtaken boys in almost every area. It might have
been the right story 20 years earlier, but coming out when it did,
it was like calling a wedding a funeral. It was phony, it dominated
the news for years and it was harmful. There were all these special
programs put in place for girls, and no one paid any attention to
boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Janice Weinman, executive director of the AAUW, defends the
report. `` `How Schools Shortchange Girls' was a wake-up call,''
she said. ``I think it's because of that report that girls made
progress in math and science.''
</P>
<P>
   Others have also found it valuable.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my mind, it was a good thing that the AAUW got us to worry
about girls, because there is no question in my mind that women in
classrooms were treated with less respect and interest than boys,''
said Frank Newman, president of the Education Commission of the
States, a policy group in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boy-girl problem is much deeper than education, it's a
civic responsibility problem. When I was a university president,
dealing with discipline cases where someone was being expelled or
suspended, it was always boys. I don't remember a single girl. We
need to teach boys responsibility. That's why sexual harassment is
still a problem. Boy-girl differences are still important, but they
pale in comparison to the big differences in education, which are
due to race and class.''
</P>
<P>
   This fall, the AAUW issued a follow-up report, talking about
girls' gains, as well as the areas where boys lag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree, the issue shouldn't be boys versus girls,'' Ms.
Weinman said. ``It should be equity and excellence for everyone.
And we're not stuck in the same groove, singing the same song. Our
follow-up report said number one, that girls had made real
progress; number two, that boys had not made that kind of progress
in the fields where they lag, and number three, that we should look
at subgroups, like Hispanic girls or African-American boys, to
determine where there are particular needs.''
</P>
<P>
   But even the new report emphasized a growing technology gap that
leaves girls less equipped for skilled computer jobs, calling
technology the new boy's club.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a significant problem, and we're very concerned about
it,'' Ms. Weinman said. ``And it's true, we're the American
Association of University Women, and our mission is to look at
education for girls and women.''

WITH SO MANY PRESENTS, THERE'S ANGST IN TOYLAND

 (Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review)

<P>
   Half-crazed, shrieking children rip into present after present,
tossing toys right, left and up in the air. Suddenly, they are
done. Some are still wild-eyed, but some are dazed as they stare at
their seasonal loot. Soon, all are playing merrily with the empty
boxes as if they are the best toys of all.
</P>
<P>
   America's children are being buried in an avalanche of toys.
It's partly a function of demographics: There are fewer children
and more adults to dote on them. But television's ceaseless
shilling of merchandise fuels the fire. So do guilt on the part of
working, often absentee parents; clever marketing of toys as
learning tools, and the inescapable realization that a kid
transfixed by a toy is a kid temporarily not bothering a parent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough, already!'' is the cry of a growing chorus of
professionals dealing with children. They fear children are being
simultaneously overstimulated and desensitized by a deluge of
misguided love.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even grandparents are becoming almost hesitant to give their
grandchildren toys,'' said Dr. Karen Nesbitt Shanor, a clinical
psychologist in Washington. ``They see the children have so many
toys and that everybody's overwhelmed by the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Shanor, who next year will publish a book on the development
of children's brains called ``The Emerging Mind,'' said too much
gift-generated stimulation can hurt learning by decreasing
concentration. Moreover, she said, the stimulation itself feeds the
need for ever more stimulation as a result of chemical changes in
the mind. Ultimately, such an addiction to stimulation can
contribute to such syndromes as attention deficit disorder. ``It's
a vicious cycle,'' Dr. Shanor said.
</P>
<P>
   Kids might be pardoned for seeing a different sort of
viciousness. After lecturing that candy rots teeth and playground
see-saws are unsafe and peanut butter sandwiches are dangerous, the
grown-ups are now plotting to take away Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   But too many gifts can affect a child's emerging sense of self
worth, said Dr. Paul Ciborowski, a professor in the counseling
department of Long Island University. Children can become confused
if their value seems to be measured in things, he said. In the
worst cases, a child could begin measuring his worth by how much
money is spent on him, Ciborowski added.
</P>
<P>
   ``A genuine expression of caring is very important in terms of
the ego development of young children,'' he said. ``Toys are only
one of a number of ways to share and express love.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody blames children, but almost all experts fault parents for
the toy explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many parents communicate feelings by giving gifts rather than
by direct communication of their feelings,'' said Dr. Kenneth
Skodnek, a child psychiatrist at Nassau County Medical Center, on
New York's Long Island. ``It's almost as if materialism becomes the
matrix of social relations _ our sense of self esteem and our
relation to others.''
</P>
<P>
   Adults, the experts say, should simply take a firm stand.
``Children need adults to tell them they've had too much candy,''
said Dr. Gail Saltz, a psychologist at New York Cornell Medical
Center. ``And if the adult is the cause of too much candy, it's
really a bad situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Common sense, without shades of Ebenezer Scrooge, is the goal.
One of Dr. Shanor's suggestions is to parcel gifts out over longer
periods; she even suggests putting away all but a couple of gifts
after they are opened.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nancy Brush, a psychology professor at Fordham University,
says Hanukkah with its eight days of gift-giving, or celebrating
the 12 Days of Christmas, can be considerably more reasonable than
a single gift-giving orgy.
</P>
<P>
   Another idea is to give children more complicated toys that can
engage them for longer periods of time. ``More complicated toys
that are developmentally appropriate are better than multiple
toys,'' Dr. Brush said.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, she suggested a toy called a surprise box that
requires five different skills to open: To open one door, you slide
a lever, and to open another, you flip the equivalent of a light
switch. Such toys, she said, can enhance a child's sense of
mastery. And motivation to achieve, she added, flows from doing
something simple and having an effect on one's environment.
</P>
<P>
   But this requires concentrated study and thought on the part of
children _ and an overabundance of toys can be a decided
distraction. ``If you have too many toys, children don't want to
explore a particular toy in depth,'' Dr. Brush said.
</P>
<P>
   Along the same lines, child experts say toys should be chosen to
encourage fantasy. Complicated toys that offer more to watch than
to do are a no-no.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more the toy does for you, the less opportunity you have
to engage actively,'' said Elizabeth Schnur, a psychologist at the
Jewish Child Care Association who studies the developmental reasons
some children do better than others.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeffrey Derevensky, a child psychologist at McGill
University, has studied toys and children extensively. He has also
worked as a consultant with Fisher-Price and others to get better
toys on the market.
</P>
<P>
   He points out that even from a child's viewpoint, more is not
always better. An example is children's desire to hear the same
book read over and over. ``If you read it enough times, they know
it by heart,'' he said. ``But you can't skip pages in it. They want
that kind of element of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Educational toys are best, Derevensky said, particularly
educational computer software. ``The best thing about a computer is
that it has an infinite amount of patience,'' he said. ``It never
yells at a child. It never says, `How many times are we going to
have to go over this before you learn it?'''
</P>
<P>
   But Derevensky and others particularly recommended gifts like
board games that can bring families together to participate in an
activity. ``When you think about the fond memories of holiday
times,'' he said, ``certainly some of the things stand out, like
the old Schwinn bicycle. But the vast majority of the memories are
personal ones, the ones where families did things together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask kids what is the best part of Christmas, and they'll say,
`No school and I got to go to the movies with my parents.' ''

This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,

criticism from publishing houses.)

JOHN TRAVOLTA'S `CIVIL' WAR FOR RESPECT

 Includes a color slide of John Travolta in a scene from ``A Civil
Action.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Everybody seems to love that Travolta guy.
 &HT;    No, not John Travolta, the two-time Oscar nominee who's one of
Hollywood's biggest stars. We're talking about his son, 6-year-old
Jett.
 &HT;    ``I have never seen anything like it in my life,'' Jett's father
says. ``Ever since he was born, everyone has been in love with this
little boy.
 &HT;    ``People love Jett,'' he insists, ``and I don't mean in a
superficial way. I don't mean infatuation. I mean, strangers are
deeply in love with him. He has this effect on people.''
 &HT;    If that doesn't sound like a typical movie-star quote _ nothing
about his own brilliance, his tough struggle to the top, the
importance of ``the work'' or even why he wants to direct _ don't
worry. Travolta Sr. is not a typical movie star.
 &HT;    For example, he doesn't sign autographs anymore. Which doesn't
mean he blows off his fans. Instead he stops to talk to them.
 &HT;    ``People are actually hungry for the communication,'' he
explains. ``When I'm out, I think of life as a social occasion. I
figure fans are people who give me undivided attention. I don't
want to disappoint them and be an a--hole. People have always been
decent and respectful to me _ there is no reason that I should be
disgruntled.''
 &HT;    He's even happily married, to actress Kelly Preston, and is
happy to say that the two still go on dates together.
 &HT;    ``We get dressed up, very black tie. And then we go dancing at
the Rainbow Room in New York. It's very romantic,'' the 44-year-old
actor says. ``At those times, I think that my life is some 1930s
movie.''
 &HT;    It's also some 1990s movie _ two, in fact. This Christmas Day
heralds a virtual Travolta film festival, with the simultaneous
release of ``A Civil Action'' and ``The Thin Red Line.'' The latter
will open only in New York and Los Angeles, however, reaching more
cities throughout January.
 &HT;    Both are serious dramas, a genre with which Travolta has rarely
been associated previously. ``A Civil Action,'' adapted from
Jonathan Harr's based-on-fact best-seller, casts him as Jan
Schlichtmann, a slick lawyer whose life changes radically when he
tackles a toxic-waste case in Woburn, Mass.
 &HT;    Even Harr didn't originally judge Travolta right for the role,
but the actor fought hard for it.
 &HT;    ``I wanted this role,'' he says. ``The fact that the character
is cynical, detached, arrogant and insensitive made it seem fun to
play and watch.''
 &HT;    Travolta also tried to recruit his friend Marlon Brando to play
the opposing attorney, a role Robert Duvall ended up playing.
 &HT;    ``Marlon was offered the film,'' Travolta says, ``but it didn't
work out. He is my buddy, and I would have loved for him to do it.
 &HT;    ``I was just as thrilled with Duvall,'' he hastens to add.
 &HT;    The hardest part of making the film, the actor says, was
visiting one of the real-life families in the case, people who had
lost their 8-year-old son to leukemia.
 &HT;    ``I didn't do it to dig into their pain,'' Travolta says, his
brow furling at the memory. ``I didn't want to grill them on their
issues. I wanted to be John for them.''
 &HT;    He got more than he expected from the visit, he adds.
 &HT;    ``The mother of the little boy told me, `Did you know that when
my son was at his sickest point, we watched ``Welcome Back
Kotter?'''
 &HT;    Travolta, who starred in that 1970s television sitcom, was
touched.
 &HT;    ``In my heart, I felt happy that I did my bit for that family,''
he says. ``If in some minor way I gave that little boy any joy
during his last year ... ''
 &HT;    The actor's voice trails off.
 &HT;    ``I wish I could give everyone some joy,'' he says finally.
 &HT;    Early viewers are already touting Travolta as an Oscar
candidate, a prospect which he admits _ again, most unlike a
typical movie star _ would delight him.
 &HT;    ``To be honest with you, I would be thrilled to be acknowledged
for this particular performance,'' he says. ``It would represent
work that I'm especially proud of when I look back on my films. If
you could choose your career performances, I think this one is it
for me.
 &HT;    ``Of course, I don't want to take anything away from `Saturday
Night Fever' (1977) or `Pulp Fiction' (1994),'' he adds, looking
back on his two previous Oscar nominations. ``I just think this
work has a nobility to it.''
 &HT;    An Oscar would be the capstone to a career comeback that has
stunned even Travolta. All but washed up until ``Pulp Fiction,''
the actor has followed it with a steady stream of hits, including
``Broken Arrow'' (1995), ``Phenomenon'' (1996), ``Get Shorty'' and
``Michael'' (1996).
 &HT;    Of course, there have been disappointments along the way, most
notably two money-losers earlier in 1998 _ ``Mad City'' and the
political satire, ``Primary Colors.''
 &HT;    But every career has ups and downs, even one which began at age
8 when his mother, Helen, an actress and dancer, threw Johnny on
stage at a July 4 fair in their native New Jersey.
 &HT;    ``I did the twist and about 30,000 people whooped with
delight,'' Travolta recalls. ``I wouldn't stop twisting. My mother
finally had to tell the orchestra to stop playing so I would get
off the stage.''
 &HT;    By the time he was a teenager he was doing ``Welcome Back
Kotter,'' which led to his film debut in ``Carrie'' (1976) and then
to the smash-hit ``Saturday Night Fever.''
 &HT;    ``I really enjoyed the solo dance,'' Travolta says. ``At the
time the film was released, I wanted to go out into a disco and
experience what the culture was experiencing, but I couldn't. It
would have created a mob scene.''
 &HT;    There would be one more hit _ ``Grease'' (1978) _ and then a
series of flops. Simultaneously, his private life absorbed a series
of blows. His first girlfriend, actress Diana Hyland, died of
cancer. A year later he lost his mother.
 &HT;    He credits his faith in the controversial religion Scientology
for pulling him through the rough spots.
 &HT;    ``There's nothing Scientology can't handle,'' he says. ``It's a
catchall.''
 &HT;    Nowadays the rough spots are fewer and further between. He and
Preston have mansions in Maine and Los Angeles, and travel back and
forth in the private planes that Travolta pilots himself. Even in
the days of his slump, the actor never endured financial hardship,
having invested his early income cannily.
 &HT;    ``I've had a blessed life,'' he says. ``I always knew the value
of good taste and wise investments.''
 &HT;    His future includes the military thriller ``The General's
Daughter,'' as well as ``The Shipping News,'' a love story in which
Preston will co-star. Further down the line, Travolta is interested
in Martin Scorsese's Rat Pack biopic.
 &HT;    ``I would love to get out there and sing and dance again,'' he
says.
 &HT;    And he has plans someday to do a film biography of Scientology
founder L. Ron Hubbard, and is also developing ``Battlefield
Earth,'' based on a science-fiction book by Hubbard _ both in
keeping with Travolta's view of himself as ``an ambassador'' for
his religion.
 &HT;    In short, the atypical movie star can afford to be nice _ after
all, it would be hard for things to work out any better than they
have recently.
 &HT;    Which leads to his early new year's resolution:
 &HT;    ``I really believe in the joy of life,'' he says. ``I don't mean
that in some frivolous way. I think my resolution is just to
remember that humans should be happy. I don't think we're here to
be in pain or to suffer.
 &HT;    ``We're here to enjoy life,'' he says. ``I wish that on all
people.''

JULIA ROBERTS: GLAD TO BE GROWN UP 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
NIRDI RELIS in New York at 212-499-3333, or by fax at

 Includes a color slide of Julia Roberts with Susan Sarandon in a
scene from ``Stepmom.'' 
 By JEANNE WOLF and SHEP MORGAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Julia Roberts radiates a disarming, no-nonsense friendliness,
cemented by a startlingly firm handshake, as she enters a suite in
a trendy New York hotel.
 &HT;    Clad in a black sweater and matching jeans, Roberts gives her
dark-brown tresses a toss, takes a healthy gulp of imported water
and flashes the grin that melted hearts in her Academy
Award-nominated performance in ``Pretty Woman'' (1990).
 &HT;    The 31-year-old actress is in high spirits, and why not? Coming
off last year's blockbuster ``My Best Friend's Wedding,'' she's
co-starring with Susan Sarandon in the much-touted ``Stepmom.'' She
has a special man in her life, handsome Benjamin Bratt from the
television series ``Law and Order.''
 &HT;    Last but not least, she's set to collect $17 million _ making
her the highest-paid actress in Hollywood history _ for her next
film, ``Runaway Bride,'' which will reunite her with ``Pretty
Woman'' co-stars Richard Gere and Hector Elizondo, along with
director Garry Marshall.
 &HT;    ``This whole show-business thing is a bizarre, trippy little
ride,'' Roberts says, ``but I'm having fun.''
 &HT;    ``Stepmom'' pairs Roberts with Sarandon, an old friend whom she
met through Sarandon's longtime companion, actor/director Tim
Robbins. Sarandon is cast as a divorced mother who can't cope with
the idea of Roberts, her ex-husband's girlfriend, becoming her
kids' stepmom _ until she herself is stricken with cancer.
 &HT;    The only reservations Roberts had about the film, she says,
concerned its title.
 &HT;    ``Susan and I thought `Stepmom' sounded like a horror film,''
she says. ``The two of us dreamed up scads of titles. I came up
with `If I Needed You,' which is the title of the song I sing to
Susan's young son when he visits her in the hospital. I thought
that would work, but there are always people in a far-distant place
called Hollywood who shoot down your ideas. So `Stepmom' it is.''
 &HT;    Knowing Sarandon well didn't make Roberts any calmer about the
challenge of holding her own with the 52-year-old, Academy
Award-winning actress, she says.
 &HT;    ``You want her respect,'' she explains. ``So the first day we
were on camera together I'm thinking, `What if I suck? What if
Susan thinks I'm really bad?' But I got over it.
 &HT;    ``What's more,'' she continues with a laugh, ``Susan plays this
supermom who spends a lot time basically ripping me apart for
failing to get along with her kids and telling me that I'll never
make a good mother. I know it was only a movie, but there were days
when she was being horrible to me and I thought, `Susan's a great
actress, but I wish she wasn't so convincing!'''
 &HT;    Roberts's character is torn between her lover's children and her
own career as a fashion photographer, a dilemma that the actress
couldn't identify with.
 &HT;    ``I don't really relate to the idea of career vs. family,'' she
says. ``I don't understand the `vs.,' I guess. A lot of us wouldn't
be here if both our parents hadn't worked. I know I wouldn't _ my
mother always had a job.
 &HT;    ``My parents were divorced when I was 4,'' she adds. ``I don't
remember it, but I don't think it was that traumatic for me. I just
accepted it as a circumstance of life.''
 &HT;    Roberts's own rocky, highly publicized journey through love and
marriage has included two broken engagements _ to actors Dylan
McDermott and Kiefer Sutherland _ as well as a brief marriage to
singer Lyle Lovett and numerous other short-term relationships.
 &HT;    Of them all, Roberts says, the one that still means the most to
her is Lovett.
 &HT;    ``He's one of my best friends,'' she insists. ``I can't imagine
him not being in my life.''
 &HT;    Asked about her current relationship, which has spanned the past
year, Roberts chokes on a swig of water.
 &HT;    ``Ben is just the same old guy, the same old date,'' she says,
giggling. ``Why is the media so impatient? It's like, `Marriage,
have kids, get on with it!' Doesn't anybody understand that life
just kind of flows?
 &HT;    ``This isn't something that I ponder on a daily basis,'' she
adds, ``but, having dealt with it in `Stepmom,' I think if you're
in a relationship, and it's an open relationship, then you have to
accept the entire person and everything that comes with them, from
kids from another marriage to the way they dress and what they eat.
 &HT;    ``You can't be too selective and start adding qualifications
that the person you're in love with has to live up to,'' Roberts
says. ``That's not the secret to a happy life together.''
 &HT;    In short, Roberts says, at 31 she's still in no mood to tie
herself down.
 &HT;    ``I'd like to have kids,'' she says. ``It's just that I don't
have a five-year plan. It's more like I'm on the five-minute plan.
I really do enjoy my life, but if you plan too far ahead you can be
way down the road and missing the moment.''
 &HT;    Right now, she'd rather think about ``Runaway Bride,'' which
she's currently filming.
 &HT;    ``It's not a sequel to `Pretty Woman,''' she says, ``even though
we're all back together again. For some reason I just pictured us
all sitting around talking, because we hadn't seen each other in a
while. I forgot that we'd actually have to work. But it's been a
gas.''
 &HT;    She and Gere have a romance in the film, she says, but it won't
include anything to equal their bathtub scene in ``Pretty Woman.''
That may have seemed romantic to the audience, the actress adds,
but in person it was anything but.
 &HT;    ``That was not a fun moment,'' Roberts recalls with a laugh.
``First of all, you spend hours in the water. Then your body
stocking is pinching. Finally, I kept lathering up Richard's chest
with soap and he goes, `You've got to stop, my skin is cracking
open.'''
 &HT;    The media have been fascinated by Roberts's record paycheck for
the film, but she insists that the whole issue has been overblown.
 &HT;    ``I don't think I want to be remembered as the $17 million
woman,'' she says. ``I'd like to be known as the great-actress
woman or the great-friend woman _ even the nice-legs woman would be
OK.
 &HT;    ``Seventeen million is just a number,'' Roberts adds. ``I love
what I'm doing _ don't tell anybody, but I'd do it for free. I'm
certainly not going to perform better just because I get paid more.
And if the movie sucks it's going to suck, no matter how much the
actors got paid.''
 &HT;    More important, she says, is that she wants to continue to
challenge herself as an actress, even if audiences have not always
responded well when she has done so in the past.
 &HT;    ``I think the woman I play in `Stepmom' is the most grown-up
character, the most real-life person, I've ever played,'' she says.
``I'm not sure I could have played her when I was in my 20s _ I
wouldn't have understood her the way I do now. I hope that, as I
mature, my roles will keep on growing up with me.''
 &HT;    Throughout the interview, Roberts has been fingering a silver
medallion around her neck.
 &HT;    ``It's an `Om,''' she says. ``You know, the meditative sound of
harmony.''
 &HT;    The symbol is meaningful to her, she says, because harmony is an
important part of her life, even if she can't always achieve it.
 &HT;    ``It's about keeping things simple, I think,'' the actress says.
``My dad used to talk about how difficult it is to be simple. But
when you're in the midst of chaos, you need to take a moment and
distill things down to the simplest factor.
 &HT;    ``Concentrate on that, and everything else will fall into
place.''

MAYA ANGELOU: A NEW ROAD LEADS `DOWN IN THE DELTA'

 Includes a color slide of Maya Angelou directing Wesley Snipes and
Alfre Woodard in a scene from ``Down in the Delta.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    To Dr. Maya Angelou's seemingly infinite list of identities _
poet, teacher, author, mother, actress, grandmother, civil-rights
activist, playwright _ add one more: movie director.
 &HT;    ``To write poetry, one first needs a fluency in the language,''
says Angelou, a larger-than-life woman _ part wistful storyteller,
part imposing, cantankerous taskmaster _ during a conversation at
Beverly Hills' Four Seasons Hotel. ``One needs big eyes and good
ears, then the courage to see and to hear, and then the courage to
say what you see and hear about the human being, about our
condition.
 &HT;    ``The words are the grist,'' she adds. ```Making a movie, I can
use an actor and a camera to tell a volume without one word being
spoken. I can't offer a book at the bookstore with five pages of
nothing on them!
 &HT;    ``So the poetry is of a different kind, but it's all poetry.''
 &HT;    Written by Myron Goble, ``Down in the Delta'' _ which opens on
Christmas Day _ is the saga of Loretta (Alfre Woodard), an
uneducated, substance-abusing, African-American mother of two who
can't find work in her bleak Chicago neighborhood. Desperate,
Loretta's mother, Rosa Lynn (Mary Alice), pawns a family heirloom _
a candelabra dubbed ``Nathan'' _ and sends Loretta and the kids
down to Mississippi to be with Loretta's Uncle Earl (Al Freeman
Jr.), a successful businessman with an appreciation of family, a
sense of history and a contagious air of serenity.
 &HT;    ``The film presented itself, and I loved the story,'' Angelou
says. ``It is such a good, human story that I could have shot it in
Canton, Ohio, or Canton, China, if I knew enough of the particulars
of the culture, the nuances which are the only real differences
between human beings anyway.
 &HT;    ``Do you fry your eggs or boil them? Otherwise, we're all the
same.''
 &HT;    Many first-time directors would have had a hard time lining up
A-list talent for so commercially problematic a film. Not so for
Angelou _ it's pronounced ``AN-gel-oh'' _ whose literary renown and
prestige in the African-American community proved a potent magnet
for actors.
 &HT;    ``When I first read the script, I saw Al Freeman Jr.,'' she
says. ``That character is in every family, in every culture,
sometimes on every block _ irascible, curmudgeonly, gruff. Pull off
one layer, and he's tender as a rose.
 &HT;    ``But we've not seen this man in the black film,'' she adds.
``I've known Al for 25 or 30 years, so it was grand to see him play
that man.''
 &HT;    The neophyte director also knew Alfre Woodard from her acting
stint in ``How to Make an American Quilt'' (1995), in which Woodard
co-starred.
 &HT;    ``You can get lost in the ocean of her eyes,'' Angelou says,
``and I thought, `Boy, wouldn't it be nice to direct her.'
 &HT;    ``And there was no one but (the late) Esther Rolle for the role
of the Alzheimer's (victim) and Mary Alice as Rosa Lynn,'' she
says. ``Then there's Wesley (Snipes). I'd heard him read a poem for
a CD of `Il Postino' (1997), and my jaw dropped. So I wanted to
work with him.
 &HT;    ``The actors gave me everything I asked for and change,'' she
says with a laugh. ``I think each one came to steal the movie,
actually.''
 &HT;    Many observers were surprised when Angelou chose to direct
``Down in the Delta.'' It would have seemed more natural for her to
film one of her own stories, rather than one by another person _
especially one that is, improbably, an African-American woman's
saga written by a white, male Georgian.
 &HT;    Actually, the mere fact that she wanted to direct struck many as
remarkable. It can't be easy for a writer, whose words are hers
alone, completely under her control, to open herself to the
collaborative world of filmmaking. Directors may be at the top of
the cinematic food chain, but even the most absolute movie monarch
must filter his or her vision through the eyes of dozens, even
hundreds of actors, designers, cinematographers, editors and more.
 &HT;    ``That's true,'' Angelou says, nodding. ``I was asked why I
didn't write the script or do one of my own stories, and it's
because I believe in equal distribution of labor.
 &HT;    ``When I finish writing a book,'' she explains, ``I've said all
I know to say about that subject. I don't know any more, and if I'd
known more I would have put more in there.
 &HT;    ``So I had to shift gears. That way I would not be so totally in
the piece that my ego got tripped up in it, too.''
 &HT;    At 70, Angelou is also considerably older than the usual
first-time director. She'd written a couple of screenplays
previously _ for ``Georgia, Georgia'' (1972) and the television
movie ``Sister, Sister'' (1982) _ but ``Down in the Delta'' is her
first time behind the camera, a fact which concerns her not a whit.
In fact, not long ago she told Oprah Winfrey that ``70 is
rocking.''
 &HT;    Angelou laughs heartily at the memory.
 &HT;    ``Somebody asked me the other day about getting old, what do I
think about it?'' she says. ``I said, `Do it. Do it!'''
 &HT;    The trick, of course, is to do it right.
 &HT;    ``I really have the ambition to be great ... inside myself, to
exercise every chance I have,'' she says. ``See, I think we do a
disservice to ourselves by saying, `You shouldn't be a Jack of all
trades and a master of none.'
 &HT;    ``Baloney,'' she says heartily. ``We don't understand
electricity at all. We probably use one-billionth of one-billionth
of one-billionth percent of it, and yet we can plug into a wall and
light a cathedral, a synagogue or a temple, or we can electrocute a
person strapped in a chair.
 &HT;    ``Electricity makes no demands,'' the writer says. ``It says,
`I'm here. If you want to use me intelligently, do so, and if you
want to use me stupidly, do so.'
 &HT;    ``I think talent is like that. I think we're all born with
talent. Sometimes, by the time we're 3 or 4, it's knocked out of
us.''
 &HT;    Angelou endured a tough childhood, one she chronicled in her
memoir, ``I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings'' (1970). She credits her
grandmother for not letting anyone ever knock the talent out of
her.
 &HT;    ``She was incredible,'' Angelou says. ``When she died, she was
still over 6 foot, and she always spoke softly.
 &HT;    ``I was mute for about six years,'' she recalls. ``People
thought I was an idiot, a moron. My grandmother would say, `When
the Good Lord gets ready, you're going to be a teacher.'
 &HT;    ``I used to think, `This poor, ignorant woman. Good Lord!'''
 &HT;    Eventually, however, her grandmother's faith was borne out.
 &HT;    ``I teach all over the world,'' Angelou says, still touched with
wonder. ``I lecture at Exeter and Oxford, I'm on the library board
at Harvard, and I teach in French and Spanish.''
 &HT;    So much teaching. Can there be anything left to learn for one
who's lived so rich a life?
 &HT;    ``Everything,'' Angelou says instantly. ``Everything!''
 &HT;    Nevertheless, she admits that there are some aspects of aging
which intimidate her.
 &HT;    ``Losing my friends is really hard for me,'' the writer says
softly, somberly. ``Jessica Mitford and Betty Shabazz died within
two years. When Jessica died, I went to Betty. When Betty died,
there was no Jessica to go to.
 &HT;    ``This is the hardest part of growing older _ it's not the aches
and pains,'' she says. ``Art Linkletter is absolutely right. Old
age is not for sissies. Oh, no, no, no.''
 &HT;    Angelou grins a bit, and both her energy and wit return.
 &HT;    ``The physical challenges are pretty grim and tiring,'' she
says. ``But you can always have a scotch.''

 Includes a color slide of Ray Romano with Patricia Heaton and a
small child in a scene from ``Everybody Loves Raymond.'' 
 By DAVID KRONKE  
 c.1998 Canadian TV Guide  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You'd think by now he could stop worrying.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Romano, star of ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' has seen his
CBS show weather initially low ratings _ despite critical acclaim _
and go on, in its second year, to become one of television's most
popular comedies.
</P>
<P>
   But no, the notoriously troubled comedian has plenty to worry
about even now _ such as his own past, which reared up to confront
him on a recent plane trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those first-year episodes?'' Romano says. ``American Airlines
shows them. I put my head between my legs, I can't watch them. I
was watching one episode with one of the writers, my friend Tom
(Caltabiano). We were in first class, and there were some
celebrities _ Matt Dillon, Mira Sorvino and Nick Turturro _ and on
comes this one episode that I thought I was particularly horrible
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Romano winces at the memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God, they don't watch,'' he says, grimacing. ``First
class doesn't watch, you know _ but during this one scene, I ducked
down in my seat until I thought it was over. I called to Tom, `Is
it over?' And he said, `Stay down, Ray, stay down!'''
</P>
<P>
   The comic probably qualifies as his own harshest critic. After
all, by now the show is a certified hit. Not only does it regularly
beat Fox's much-hyped ``Ally McBeal,'' but it even occasionally
outscores ``Monday Night Football'' in sports-crazy New York.
</P>
<P>
   This season has found the show _ centering on sportswriter Ray
Barone, his wife (Patricia Heaton), their three kids and his
parents, who live inconveniently just across the street _ in a
strong comic groove, fueled in part by Ray's jealousy of his inept
brother (Brad Garrett), who has moved out of their parents' house
and embraced the joys of single life.
</P>
<P>
   By rights, the ratings should have Romano jumping for joy, but
only now has he reached the point at which, asked if he thinks his
show will last, he responds with a reluctant ``Uhh, yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't reach for the Champagne.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't make me feel comfortable, you know,'' he adds
quickly, ``because I'd just replace it with other worries. Like,
`Now you're a top-20 show, what does it take to become a top-10
show?' Or, `How do we continue the quality of the story lines?' I
mean, everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to sit back and say, `Oh, the show's a well-oiled
machine now, I don't have to worry about it,''' he says. ``Then you
get too lazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Even getting laughs worries this fretful funny man.
</P>
<P>
   ``The studio audiences know the show so well. Used to be, we
couldn't buy a laugh because we were all strangers to them,'' he
recalls. ``Laughs were hard to come by, and that was disturbing me.
Now they so love the show that in the beginning, when we start
filming, they laugh at anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that disturbs me _ they're laughing too much now,'' he
says. ``You have to trust your instincts, because you could have a
lame joke in there and they would laugh just the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``So yeah,'' he concedes with a smile, ``there's always
something wrong. But there are worse things to complain about.''
</P>
<P>
   He's feeling more comfortable about acting, he adds. It had been
a legitimate concern before the show began _ after all, he'd never
before played a character other than himself _ but he's worked hard
to improve, and is feeling better in front of the cameras. And that
in turn has improved every other aspect of the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're so much better now,'' he says. ``I'm more
comfortable, everybody's more comfortable and the rhythms are all
there, you know. And the writers know the characters better, so
that helps.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the show struggled because its subject matter _
domestic family humor _ clashed with its tone _ sharp, smart and
more than a little edgy.
</P>
<P>
   People didn't know what to make of the series. ``Seinfeld''
fans, its target audience, avoided it because there was a whiff of
``Full House'' about it. But ``Married with Children'' fans found
it too cerebral.
</P>
<P>
   The support of most critics was a big help in convincing CBS to
stick with the show and let its audience find it. In addition,
Romano says, steady exposure is essential for a show whose humor is
truly character-based.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone else seems to be doing shows joke-to-joke instead of
building characters and relationships,'' he says. ``I don't respond
to those. I think that maybe, as good as `Seinfeld' was, it
inspired some imitations that really were about nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``On shows like that, you're only as good as your last joke,''
he adds. ``Rather than creating a show that'll last forever, they
want to create something that will get a laugh this Wednesday at 9
p.m. Everything hinges on the punchline, but then you have to start
over. Nothing is built in terms of characterizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked from a different direction,'' the comedian says.
``Maybe we could've gotten canceled, but people responded to these
characters. It stood out, maybe because it was different, maybe
because it strikes chords that people can relate to.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the show is based on Romano's own life, except for the
character of Ray's overbearing mother (Doris Roberts), who he says
comes more from executive producer Phil Rosenthal's experience.
</P>
<P>
   The eccentricities displayed in Peter Boyle's portrayal of
Raymond's father are fairly dead-on, Romano says. In fact, when
Boyle finally met the comedian's dad, ``He was surprised that he
wasn't a big monster.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Romano doesn't love his father, but he attributes his
own attraction to the applause- and laughter-filled world of comedy
to the lack of warmth in his relationship with his dad.
</P>
<P>
   ``His undemonstrativeness helped,'' he says. ``I think I get my
sense of humor from him. He keeps doing things that bother my wife,
and I keep telling her, `Look, it's 13 years now, don't you know
he's trying to be funny?' He won't stop, and she won't see that
it's the only way he can communicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of my father's traits,'' Romano adds. ``It's
weird that I'm in acting, because I'm shy around people, not
demonstrative even with family members. Now that I have kids, I try
to go out of my way to show them affection _ it's so odd, because
you feel it, you love your kid more than anything, yet to say `I
love you,' you're almost embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very strange feeling, although it's getting a lot
easier now.''
</P>
<P>
   Annie, Romano's wife, is a good-natured sort who doesn't mind
being the subject of her husband's humor. For example, he has
reported that, when he signed to do the show, she had qualms about
him kissing other women, qualms that he quieted by agreeing that
for each time he kissed someone else, Annie could buy something.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, he joked that she had gotten so far ahead of
schedule that he was entitled to do an R-rated, ``Fatal
Attraction''-style movie.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Romano insists, her paranoia is escalating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her new thing is, she's watching a scene between me and Patty
and she looks at me and goes, `A lot of eye contact there,''' he
says, rolling his eyes. ``I swear to God. She says, `You're looking
at her the whole time.'
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is, `Honey, the director told me to!'''

 &HT;    Discovering some of what drew Central Texas settlers
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACKSTUMP VALLEY, Texas _ On the ridge, the Spanish oak
provided a splatter of auburn. Once upon a Central Texas autumn it
was solid color. Now the oaks poke out from among the ever-prolific
cedar, a major irony to oldtimers.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time settlers here had to import cedar wood from
elsewhere in Texas for their fence posts. Imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Now, exasperated landowners spend time pulling pesky,
water-gobbling cedars out of the ground, lest the trees consume
all.
</P>
<P>
   The prairie has changed in many ways. In many ways, it hasn't.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian grass once belly-high to a horse is virtually extinct
in these parts, grazed and plowed into history.
</P>
<P>
   But for one who doesn't know the difference it's possible to
stand on a certain spot in this valley, about five miles north of
Iredell, and imagine that this is the way Stacy Tidwell first saw
it, and the Indians before her.
</P>
<P>
   Tidwell, a 90-year-old Waco resident, former Iredell merchant
and one-time Bosque County treasurer, is why we were here, seaching
for a stump. Don't snicker. I got enough of that from my family.
</P>
<P>
   Tidwell had called me months ago about something else. I forget.
But the conversation turned to fascinating things, like riding a
horse to work at 19 to teach at the Flag Branch School, or
attending Blackstump Valley School up on a windswept hill. The
school outhouse was across the road. On either side: unfettered
miles of blackland prairie.
</P>
<P>
   On a stump hunt
</P>
<P>
   I didn't clear it with my wife or sons that we'd spend a
Saturday looking for a charred stump, but that was my mission.
</P>
<P>
   My wife hates when I ask directions. They always get us
somewhere, but rarely ``there.'' Crossing the Bosque at Iredell and
driving north until the end of the pavement on F.M. 216, we looked
for an old school or its remnants. No luck. No stump, either. The
only sign of activity, and hope for solid leads, was back in
Iredell at VFW Post 8559.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, a group of vets and their wives busily prepared a
Thanksgiving feed, while a few slackers concentrated on a good
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking for the black stump of Blackstump Valley,'' I told
a foursome elbow-deep in dominoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gone,'' said one under his VFW cap. ``I pulled that out
of the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' I reacted, not sensing my leg was being jiggled. ``Well,
do you know where I could find the old Blackstump School?''
</P>
<P>
   The players swiveled and pointed into the kitchen. ``Ask him,''
they said.
</P>
<P>
   A man wiped roll-making shortening off his hands and shook mine.
Doak Simpson is the name. He owns the property on which Stacy
Tidwell's old school sat. I found that to be quite a stroke. Like I
tell my wife, all you have to do is ask.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson is a native of the Blackstump Valley, but lives in Forth
Worth where he retired after a career in engineering. He still owns
a weekend residence in the valley. Brother Tom lives nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The Simpsons' forebears settled here in 1901. Doak Simpson went
to school in Iredell _ Iredell Dragons Class of '47 _ and served in
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Wonderfully accommodating, Simpson readily took us to the site
of the Blackstump Valley School. There's no trace of it today, not
even an indentation.
</P>
<P>
   And what about the black stump? Simpson said the name most
likely came not from one stump but from many. The stumps, long-ago
oaks, had been charred by a range fire.
</P>
<P>
   No, there was no black stump to be found. But we had found
Blackstump Valley School, or the modest hill that seemed tall when
Stacy Tidwell was young. And we found a slice of Central Texas we'd
have never seen. Doak Simpson invited us to dinner with the VFW.
I'd have taken him up on it, but the boys were antsy to end our
stump hunt.

 &HT;    Job turmoil reflects strength of economy
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Lumps of coal are being slipped into workers'
Christmas stockings everywhere. Boeing Co., Bankers Trust, Exxon
Corp., Mobil Corp. and Johnson &AMP; Johnson are among the many
companies announcing massive firings just in time for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of Americans who thought they had secure jobs
with healthy companies are suddenly facing a new year filled with
difficult choices. Many will have to move their families to
unfamiliar cities to find new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's hard to accept on a gut level, this job turmoil is a
sign of the economy's strength. Yes, strength.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. economy is the world's powerhouse because it adjusts so
quickly to market realities. So when oil prices plunge, the
executives at Mobil and Exxon don't fret about their fates; they
move fast to combine forces and cut costs. By slashing the ranks of
employees, the merged company will be in better shape to ride out
the oil industry's tough times.
</P>
<P>
   These layoffs, cruel as they may be to the individuals involved,
will help hold down fuel prices, making other companies, such as
airlines and trucking companies, even stronger.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence that layoffs can bolster the economy is clear:
While many companies have been firing workers in record numbers,
others have been hiring as fast as they can, sending the
unemployment rate to just 4.4 percent in November. Not counting
agriculture, employers created 267,000 jobs last month, an
amazingly large number.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no matter what our heads tell us about how the economy is
booming, our hearts sink when we get those pink slips. Accepting
the notion that getting fired is good for the country is not easy.
</P>
<P>
   This month, the roughly 300 employees of Atlantic Steel
Industries Inc. will lose their jobs at a company that has provided
paychecks for blue-collar workers since 1901.
</P>
<P>
   The old mill, on the northern edge of downtown Atlanta, will be
leveled and every trace carted away next year to make room for a
spectacular project that promises to create a high-tech office
park, apartments, hotel rooms, movie theaters and stores.
</P>
<P>
   The thousands of jobs that will be created through the Atlantic
Steel redevelopment plan will boost the area's economy. Switching
from metal making to computer networking will guarantee more wealth
in the next century. Sad as it is to see good blue-collar jobs
disappear, city officials were wise to push forward with
redevelopment plans rather than try to save an obsolete plant.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's willingness to embrace change largely explains its
phenomenal growth in the 1980s and 1990s. That was driven home to
me recently during a visit with family in Youngstown, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   There, many of the old steel mill sites, empty for years, still
have not been redeveloped. Instead of focusing all of their
attention on job creation, many local leaders continue to waste
valuable time calling on government to provide more trade
protection to save the few remaining steel jobs.
</P>
<P>
   This desire to cling to the familiar is understandable. But
because of advanced technology and a global marketplace, all
factories now rest on shifting sands and no job can be ``saved''
for long.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, about 45 percent of the private-sector work force
was employed in manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   Today, goods still account for about half of the nation's
output, but only 25 percent of workers are employed in
manufacturing. Robots and other equipment have replaced human
beings in factories. In coming years, that trend will accelerate.
And as skyscrapers sprout where rolling mills once flattened steel,
a new generation of workers will find plenty of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   This process of building up, tearing down and repositioning is
ceaseless. The communities that welcome change are the ones that
will flourish in the new century.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Two governors; one inspiring justice
 &HT;    By Stebbins Jefferson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It's beautiful when a plan to ignore
partisan politics comes together. It's more than beautiful when two
governors _ the governor and the governor-elect _ decide
independently that the best candidate for the Florida Supreme Court
is an outstanding jurist with a distinguished legal career who just
happens to be a black woman.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened in Tallahassee last week. The late Gov.
Chiles and Gov.-elect Jeb Bush reached the same conclusion after
separately interviewing four finalists to succeed Justice Ben
Overton, who retires Jan. 4. The debate as to which man has the
legal authority to make the appointment became moot when both chose
Peggy Ann Quince, a judge on the 2nd District Court of Appeal, to
become the court's 79th justice.
</P>
<P>
   When Gov. Chiles appointed her to the 2nd DCA in 1993, she
became the first black woman to serve on one of Florida's five
appellate courts. At that time, the 1975 graduate of the Catholic
University of America law school had completed more than 13 years
with the criminal division of the Florida Attorney General's
Office. She spent five of those years as Tampa bureau chief, and
her handling of death penalty cases earned praise.
</P>
<P>
   As an undergraduate at Howard University (1970-74), she majored
in zoology with the intention of becoming a physician. ``But, you
know, those were turbulent times,'' she said. ``I wanted to know
more about the law.''
</P>
<P>
   By phone Wednesday afternoon, she spoke of her father _ Solomon
Quince, the greatest influence on her life _ with a reverence that
was inspiring. Though he died before she became an appellate judge,
she remembers his advice to always work hard and do your best.
Raised in Norfolk, Va., she is the second-oldest of six children
(three girls and three boys) her longshoreman father raised alone
after her parents separated. She says, ``I haven't seen my mother
since I was 7.''
</P>
<P>
   For soon-to-be-Justice Quince, ``opportunity'' is the key. At
her news conference Tuesday, she said of her appointment, ``It is a
marvelous opportunity for all of the citizens of the state of
Florida to really see that you can work hard, and do all those
things that we're told about from Day One and that it will pay
off.'' On the phone, she repeatedly emphasized that she has
received ``a great opportunity to do important work.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, lawyer Fred L. Buckine, was with her in Tallahassee
for the announcement. Also present was her older daughter, Peggy
Laverne, a Florida
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M senior interested in law. Her younger daughter, Laura
Laverne, a University of Central Florida freshman, remained at
school because she had two exams that day. Judge Quince can't
remember what her daughters said when she called to tell them the
news, except ``there was a lot of screaming for joy.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether in Tampa or Tallahassee, Judge Quince intends to
continue working in her church and community. She teaches Sunday
school and serves on the usher board at New Hope Missionary Baptist
Church, where her husband is associate pastor. ``Why would I
quit?'' she asks. ``I enjoy it so much.'' Her other activities
include membership in Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, the NAACP and the
Urban League.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gov. Chiles and Mr. Bush can claim credit for delivering
this victory for all Floridians. Without compromising standards,
both men acknowledged the importance of increased diversity, as
Judge Quince becomes the second woman (with Barbara Pariente) and
second black (with Leander Shaw) on the seven-member court.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Quince says she ``will work hard and do an excellent job
on the court.'' Given her accomplishments, we have every reason to
believe her. She has proven that race or less-than-ideal home
circumstances need not predestine mediocre performance or defeat.
Solomon Quince taught her that. Thanks to the wisdom of two
governors, she has taught us.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Car alarm a real turn-off
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Many years ago when we were house-hunting, our
real estate agent picked us up in her new car to show us some
houses. After we got into her car, we heard a robotic voice say
``Your door is ajar. Your door is ajar.''
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed, we shut the door. ``Thank you,'' came the tinny voice.
That was our first experience with ``talking cars.'' It also was
our last.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want my car to talk to me. If I have to resort to having
conversations with a vehicle, I need to check into the nearest
chapter of Get-A-Life Anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   We have been in a car-trading frenzy of late as our aging
vehicles began dying one by one. We now have newer models with
newer gadgets and fancier doodads and geegaws. I don't understand
most of them.
</P>
<P>
   And, like all right-brained people, I do not read instruction
manuals. All of which is fine when nothing goes wrong. Inevitably,
something goes wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Recently I was in the Dallas area with two of our three sons
attending yet another soccer tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Our Saturday games were at night at this lighted complex, so we
rested in our new vehicle between the 7 and 9:30 p.m. games. One
son was dozing peacefully in the back seat as I sat in the front
with my younger son, the soccer player, considering our chances of
advancing to the next day's games.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, our car's security alarm went off, screeching loudly
into the night.
</P>
<P>
   EEE-OOH, EEE-OOH, EEE-OOH.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't even know we had a security alarm. Startled, I snapped
up from my reclined position sputtering ``Wha . . . wha . . .
what?''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the sleeping son jumped up from the back seat, a
fountain of unpleasant words, but offering no help on how to turn
the thing off.
</P>
<P>
   EEE-OOH, EEE-OOH, EEE-OOH blared the alarm as I frantically
pushed buttons, pulled knobs and slid dials.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you turn this thing off?'' I barked at my children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do the opposite of whatever you did to turn it on!'' one
answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I did to turn it on,'' I shot back.
</P>
<P>
   Why is it that children always expect parents to know what to
do? Don't they know that nine times out of 10, we don't have a
clue?
</P>
<P>
   Both sons shouted suggestions to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turn the wheel!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Start the engine!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Open and shut the doors!''
</P>
<P>
   A small crowd began gathering outside our car, bemusedly
watching our frantic actions.
</P>
<P>
   In desperation, I opened the door and grabbed the first person I
saw by the coat collar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know how to turn this thing off?'' I begged.
</P>
<P>
   EEE-OOH, EEE-OOH, EEE-OOH.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's your instruction manual,'' he asked reasonably.
</P>
<P>
   ``At home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have one of those automatic locks on your keychain?''
he asked.
</P>
<P>
   I grabbed the keys from the ignition and hit the ``lock'' and
``unlock'' buttons in rapid succession. The alarm stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Silence filled the night, and the grinning onlookers began to
disperse. The boys and I looked at each other and heaved a
collective sigh of relief. I took several deep breaths, and my
heart rate gradually returned to the normal range.
</P>
<P>
   At least during the whole spectacle there hadn't been a robotic
voice informing me ``Your alarm is sounding. Your alarm is
sounding.''
</P>
<P>
   It's times like this I really long for my '67 Mustang.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Stage-four car coasts to road's end
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A good cat and a good car have roughly the same life span.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, a good car and a good cat share a lot of other
similarities, as well. Neither demands constant attention. Both
purr when they're happy and neither leaves messes on the floor.
Neither one will burst into flames unexpectedly.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how good a car or cat is, both start reaching
their design limits after about 15 years. And that's why I found
myself sadly walking from a junkyard recently after selling out a
faithful, 15-year-old, 198,000-mile car.
</P>
<P>
   If Shakespeare calculated seven ages of man, there are four ages
of car.
</P>
<P>
   First, there is the trophy car, smelling of factory solvents and
vacuumed out immediately after the first cheeseburger is eaten
within it. It is parked gingerly and only after scouting. It is a
small island of spiffiness and order in the dangerous, ugly and
messy world around it.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the transport car. It sports supermarket
parking-lot dents that appeared out of nowhere. It was keyed once
along the passenger side, or maybe a branch did that. It has smells
that have a way of returning when summer turns humid.
</P>
<P>
   But in return for these indignities, you gain all the advantages
that come from close familiarity. You know exactly how far from the
capital ``E'' the gas meter can go before you actually need to stop
at a gas station. Because the car is thoroughly broken-in, you do
not fear excessively for its bumpers or upholstery.
</P>
<P>
   This is the golden age of car ownership _ free of the
responsibilities of a trophy car, free of the cares that are
waiting just a short way down the road.
</P>
<P>
   The third stage is the beach car, sighing like a furnace,
creaking like a house that might be haunted. But you can drive it
to the beach and the sand is no problem. You can take it on bad
roads and off roads. Teen-agers hold discussions sitting on its
hood. It's a car that has had adventures, has stories told about
it, has coffee cups hidden within its recesses.
</P>
<P>
   This is a car whose operations involve an oral lore known only
to its operators, matters spoken of in no known manual. ``Listen
for the third click and you're in reverse, no matter what the arrow
says.'' ``Hit it right here if the radio stops.'' ``Put a clothes
pin here if it won't start on a cold day.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a stage proclaimed by bumper stickers that make
grandiose claims about the make of your other car. That say ``don't
laugh, it's paid for.'' In fact, this is the stage when bumper
stickers in general don't detract from a car, they spiff it up.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is the organ-donor car. Sans water pump, sans
transmission, sans battery, sans everything.
</P>
<P>
   It is a hard decision to demote a noble beach car to the harsh
fate of a donor car. One feels unaccountably ungrateful.
</P>
<P>
   Mine looked like a forlorn thing parked in the mud of the
junkyard. Its neighbors were younger cars that lived fast lives and
met bad ends. Some had deployed air bags draped like dead, beige
balloons off the steering wheel. All were crunched somewhere and
had undoubtedly been towed to their final rusting place.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its age, though, mine at least made it there under its
own power and without violence.
</P>
<P>
   This was not easy. For it stalled unpredictably when idling and
needed lots of warning to brake. Steering it felt like Indian
wrestling and I didn't always win. Its final trip was carefully
routed for low speed and the ability to make rolling stops.
</P>
<P>
   But car and I creeped to the yard somehow and I slinked away
with $70 in American money. Much more than the cat would have
fetched.
</P>
<P>
   Some people are unhappy with anything but a stage-one
trophy-car. Some ruin the carefree time of a car's middle age by
looking for signs that it is slipping from stage two to stage
three. More prudent people ditch the heap the second they feel
stage-three car ownership upon with them.
</P>
<P>
   But me, I'm a firm believer in last-ditch driving. The beloved
old beast may be at the end of the road, but somewhere there's a
stage-two or stage-three car happily hitting road ruts thanks to
its transmission.
</P>
<P>
   It's the next best thing to reincarnation. Whether the cat can
beat that, I'll leave to theologians.

 &HT;    Keeping an eye on the 2000 election
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Albeit inadvertently, Bill Clinton has done
more for women
</P>
<P>
   with political aspirations than any of us ever could have
dreamed. His college-boy shenanigans in the White House have rolled
out a red carpet welcome for a woman in the Oval Office - this time
for all of the right reasons. If I'm reading the mood of this
country correctly, come the 2000 election even Little Mary Sunshine
would be a shoo-in for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, most folks are fed up to here with the mess going on
in the Washington sandbox, and would be happy to vote for Larry,
Moe, and Curly (or have we already done that?) if it would mean an
end to the babble. Lately, I've been trying to calculate exactly
how much of my money has been spent on lawyers arguing the
definition of ``is'' and debating what constitutes a sexual act. A
pretty sorry waste if you think about it, particularly when all we
really had to do was turn the bad boy over Hillary's knee and let
her wail on him with impunity.
</P>
<P>
   Too late for good ideas. We're in this farce up to our elbows
and all we can do now is plan for the future - the 2000 elections.
I have a few suggestions for the slate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton vs. Dole: This has a familiar ring but the first names
of the players will have been changed to Hillary and Elizabeth. The
campaign should be squeaky clean since all of the mud has already
been slung.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole seems like a prime choice. She's an experienced
manager and
</P>
<P>
   obviously has plenty of political savvy. I worry a little about
Bob, though. He's obviously a good sport, but would he really be
happy in the little office down the hall from the big office?
</P>
<P>
   Hillary might be a good choice because she knows her way around.
Of course, she'd have her work cut out for her keeping an eye on
Bill. Maybe she should just let Buddy off the leash now that he's
housebroken, and keep Bill at her heel until his obedience training
kicks in. And as long as the First Husband laid off the
cheeseburgers and didn't blow up like an inflatable Ronald
McDonald, he could still fit into his tux and be useful at State
dinners to be sure the seating came out even. Boy-girl, boy-girl.
Of course, that's the stuff that got him into trouble in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Bill seems to have blown Hillary's chances of not
having to gather up the family photos and head for Arkansas come
election day - if he lasts that long. What could have been a simple
seat swap now becomes a classic case of damned if she does and
damned if she doesn't. If she gets rid of him, she's a callous
witch. If she keeps him, she still loses, because nobody really
wants him hanging around for another four years.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe what we need are co-presidents. I nominate Mary Matalin
and James Carville, two highly vocal political pundits representing
an even split - she's intelligent, informed, and a Republican. He's
brilliant, mouthy, and a Democrat. We'd still have the opposition
in bed with one another (as the political saying goes) only in this
case it would be legal.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe we need to look outside the realm of politics.
</P>
<P>
   How about Elizabeth Taylor? She doesn't need the money and she's
a survivor.
</P>
<P>
   She admits, ``I've been through it all, baby. I'm Mother
Courage.'' Elizabeth is pretty good at telling it like it is and
she swears she's finished with men so there'd be nothing to take
her mind off of her work.
</P>
<P>
   Or how about Ann Margret? She's pretty and she's gutsy. And she
rides a Harley.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe Kathy Bates. Gail, my self-described ``fluffy'' friend
in Oregon, says
</P>
<P>
   Kathy's election would strike a note for the ``zaftig'' women in
this country.
</P>
<P>
   My two prime candidates, unfortunately, are dead.
</P>
<P>
   Flinty and abrasive Bella Abzug could have been an Oval Office
virago - a female warrior determined to tell the truth and get
things done - slowing down only long enough to be sure her hat was
on straight.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Jordan would have been my first choice. She was quite a
lady; the first black Texan in the U.S. Congress and the speaker
who mesmerized a nation with her keynote address at the 1976
Democratic convention.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Jordan was a woman of character and when she spoke, she
spoke passionately for all people from a true and beautiful heart.
It's too bad she couldn't have hung around a while longer to give
this country a lesson in good
</P>
<P>
   manners.

   Each evening when I'm treated to yet another dose of
inner-beltway insanity on the evening news, a line from ``The Lion
in Winter'' comes to mind. Referring to the sorry state of their
marriage, their kids, and their country, Eleanor asks Henry, her
husband and king, ``How, from where we began did we ever reach this
place?'' Henry shrugs.
</P>
<P>
   Kind of makes you wonder what's next, doesn't it? Hulk Hogan for
President?

 &HT;    Job turmoil reflects strength of economy
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Lumps of coal are being slipped into workers'
Christmas stockings everywhere. Boeing Co., Bankers Trust, Exxon
Corp., Mobil Corp. and Johnson &AMP; Johnson are among the many
companies announcing massive firings just in time for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of Americans who thought they had secure jobs
with healthy companies are suddenly facing a new year filled with
difficult choices. Many will have to move their families to
unfamiliar cities to find new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's hard to accept on a gut level, this job turmoil is a
sign of the economy's strength. Yes, strength.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. economy is the world's powerhouse because it adjusts so
quickly to market realities. So when oil prices plunge, the
executives at Mobil and Exxon don't fret about their fates; they
move fast to combine forces and cut costs. By slashing the ranks of
employees, the merged company will be in better shape to ride out
the oil industry's tough times.
</P>
<P>
   These layoffs, cruel as they may be to the individuals involved,
will help hold down fuel prices, making other companies, such as
airlines and trucking companies, even stronger.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence that layoffs can bolster the economy is clear:
While many companies have been firing workers in record numbers,
others have been hiring as fast as they can, sending the
unemployment rate to just 4.4 percent in November. Not counting
agriculture, employers created 267,000 jobs last month, an
amazingly large number.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no matter what our heads tell us about how the economy is
booming, our hearts sink when we get those pink slips. Accepting
the notion that getting fired is good for the country is not easy.
</P>
<P>
   This month, the roughly 300 employees of Atlantic Steel
Industries Inc. will lose their jobs at a company that has provided
paychecks for blue-collar workers since 1901.
</P>
<P>
   The old mill, on the northern edge of downtown Atlanta, will be
leveled and every trace carted away next year to make room for a
spectacular project that promises to create a high-tech office
park, apartments, hotel rooms, movie theaters and stores.
</P>
<P>
   The thousands of jobs that will be created through the Atlantic
Steel redevelopment plan will boost the area's economy. Switching
from metal making to computer networking will guarantee more wealth
in the next century. Sad as it is to see good blue-collar jobs
disappear, city officials were wise to push forward with
redevelopment plans rather than try to save an obsolete plant.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's willingness to embrace change largely explains its
phenomenal growth in the 1980s and 1990s. That was driven home to
me recently during a visit with family in Youngstown, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   There, many of the old steel mill sites, empty for years, still
have not been redeveloped. Instead of focusing all of their
attention on job creation, many local leaders continue to waste
valuable time calling on government to provide more trade
protection to save the few remaining steel jobs.
</P>
<P>
   This desire to cling to the familiar is understandable. But
because of advanced technology and a global marketplace, all
factories now rest on shifting sands and no job can be ``saved''
for long.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, about 45 percent of the private-sector work force
was employed in manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   Today, goods still account for about half of the nation's
output, but only 25 percent of workers are employed in
manufacturing. Robots and other equipment have replaced human
beings in factories. In coming years, that trend will accelerate.
And as skyscrapers sprout where rolling mills once flattened steel,
a new generation of workers will find plenty of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   This process of building up, tearing down and repositioning is
ceaseless. The communities that welcome change are the ones that
will flourish in the new century.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane S. Greig
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: How do you clean that black, crusted carbon-looking stuff on
the inside of glass fireplace screens? Also, my son and I are
``X-Files'' aficionados. Where can I find stuff for Christmas?
_Judi K.
</P>
<P>
   A: Some readers report luck with foaming bathroom cleaner to cut
the cruddy buildup on fireplace glass. Try it on a corner of the
glass to make sure it does not harm it. The glass must cool before
you clean it or it will streak _ permanently. There are cleaners
made specifically for this nasty stuff. ``X-Files'' shirts are on
sale at E! online. Call (888) 855-4979 or visit shop.eonline.com to
order. Want a Scully badge or the show's signature poster from
Mulder's office (``I Want To Believe'')? Contact the International
UFO Museum and Research Center at (800) 822-3545.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many miles does the average person walk in a lifetime?
_R. Walker
</P>
<P>
   A: The average person, according to the American Podiatric
Medical Association, walks an incredible 115,000 miles in a
lifetime (seems like more if your feet hurt). That is more than
four times the length of the equator.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why, oh why, does the symbol on a Volvo appear to be the
universal sign for ``male'' _ you know, a circle with an arrow
pointing out of it? Just wondering.
</P>
<P>
   _L. Tarver
</P>
<P>
   A: Sorry, no fiendish plot. The symbol dates from the Middle
Ages, says the public relations team at Volvo. It is the
alchemists' symbol for iron, frequently seen over the entrance to
iron mines in Europe. Volvo adopted it because of its association
with strength. The car company was founded in the 1920s by Swedes
Assar Gabrielsson and Gustaf Larson, of the SKF ball bearing
company. SKF gave the men ``seed money'' as well as the name
``Volvo'' (meaning ``I roll'' in Latin), from an extinct line of
bearings. What else but a car could use more ball bearings? Smart
guys, Assar and Gustaf. The emblem is currently used only on the
grill. The company did take a little heat from activists in the
1970s who thought the symbol had some hidden, male domination
meaning. Just not so.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Last year you described a Christmas gift-exchange game that
used a version of ``'Twas the Night Before Christmas.'' Would it be
possible for me to get a copy of that? _Margo K.
</P>
<P>
   A: Of course. Players stand in a circle clutching a wrapped
present. They pass gifts (white elephant or otherwise) to the right
or left when the words ``right'' or ``left'' appear in the text. No
one ends up with the gift he brought to the party.
</P>
<P>
   For a copy, check out my name at Austin360.com or send me a
stamped, self-addressed envelope. And to all a good night.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I had the unfortunate experience of having a candle drip wax
onto my sofa. I don't know how to get it removed without further
damage to the fabric. Please let me know if you have a solution.
Also, could you publish this request, because I know I am not the
only person who has done such a bone-headed thing. _L.L.
</P>
<P>
   A: Good idea, since this is candle season and readers usually
find wax stuck to everything from carpet to cashmere. Here is the
process. Remove what you can with a dull knife. Then place the
fabric between two pieces of brown paper or paper towels. I use
grocery bags cut into manageable pieces. With a hair dryer or iron,
gently heat the fabric. A hair dryer is easier to use on furniture.
The wax adheres to the paper. Replace the paper with fresh pieces
and repeat. Eventually you will have only an oil stain, which can
be removed with traditional cleaning _ in the washer, by a dry
cleaner or with upholstery cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In March my VISA card was stolen and a fraudulent charge of
$172.12 came through before the credit card company could recognize
it as stolen. I completed the dispute form and included a letter
with a photocopied receipt clearly showing someone else's name and
signature. The charge is STILL showing up. Over the past eight
months I have logged 30-plus phone calls to all departments of
VISA. Other than a generic ``we're investigating the matter'' form
letter, I have received no replies to my requests. I've spoken with
service reps ad nauseam. I have also called Chase VISA's corporate
offices. The VP of customer service has not responded to my
certified letter. HELP _ I'm stuck in an endless loop! _B.H.
</P>
<P>
   A: You did everything you were supposed to do; Chase VISA
dropped the ball. Judy Miller in Chase's public relations
department has credited your account and apologizes for the delay.
When reporting stolen cards and fraudulent charges, call the
service number on your statement and the fraud division will credit
your account after receiving your written affidavit.

 &HT;    Sites ready to indulge taste for the offbeat
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The trouble with the Internet these days is that it's
so danged practical.
</P>
<P>
   If you're heading for a picnic on Saturday, you can check out
the weather at the Weather Channel at http://www.weather.com. Then
you can drop in at
</P>
<P>
   http://members.xoom.com/KountryCook/sofryck.htm to get a recipe
for the fried chicken you want to bring.
</P>
<P>
   That's all well and good, but the real fun of the Web used to be
exploring pages that were totally useless but loads of fun. There
are only so many chuckles in a forecast that tells you it'll be
partly cloudy on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   So today, we'll take a break from the real world and check out
some sites that are just plain fun.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start with a site that may actually be useful. It's called
Roadside America and calls itself a guide to offbeat vacation
attractions. You'll find the home page at
http://www.roadsideamerica.com/.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've visited the page, you'll know things your friends
and co-workers do not. For instance, you'll discover on the east
side of Baltimore, in the restaurant known as Hausner's, ``there is
a huge ball of string in one of the off-rooms. Visitors to the
restaurant can't see the ball of string unless they go in search of
the restroom and make a wrong turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, in case you ever visit the little town of Norton, Kan., the
page will tell you about a ``picture gallery in the First State
Bank, with pictures of all the men who have run for president and
lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that we have your next vacation planned, let's give you
reason to celebrate. If you love holidays and find Christmas,
Hanukkah and New Year's Eve aren't enough to fill your appetite,
then there is good news for you.
</P>
<P>
   Set your browser for
</P>
<P>
   http://www.jpmorgan.com/cgi-bin/HolidayCalendar and you'll find
yourself at the J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. page devoted to holidays around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Just take any date and use the pull-down menu to set the Web
page to find the holidays for that date. You'll learn, for
instance, that tomorrow (Dec. 14) is a Russian holiday,
Constitution Day. You can also use the pull-down menus to look at
holidays specific to other countries. That way you can learn that,
in Botswana, Dec. 26, is Boxing Day.
</P>
<P>
   If you really want to waste some time, and find some surprises,
try WebCrawler Web Roulette. Just go to
http://www.webcrawler.com/cgi-bin/random and you'll be presented
with links to 10 Web pages selected at random. (Parents should keep
in mind the pages are randomly selected and the possibility exists
of being presented with material of an adult nature).
</P>
<P>
   Next let's take a look at a page called Stupid People, Crime and
Current Events at http://www.mindspring.com/(tilde)iam392/. It is
very much as it sounds, a collection of news stories about crimes
committed by stupid people. For instance, you'll learn about the
Nevada robber who let a convenience store clerk make one phone call
during a hold-up, then seemed surprised when police showed up.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if you really don't have a life at all, you may be
interested in a page devoted to people who collect the toys given
away at fast-food restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find the page at
http://www.netcore.ca/(tilde)gkillops/toys.html. If you have a
pantry full of Batman glasses, you'll feel right at home.

 &HT;    MacPac tunes up PalmPilot's power
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When it comes to hand-held computers, Mac users had
been playing second fiddle to their PC counterparts. No longer.
</P>
<P>
   3Com is finally readying Mac software for its popular PalmPilot
hand-held computer after months of delay. The software had been
promised by last summer. Oh well.
</P>
<P>
   The delay, however, appears to have been worth the wait. Initial
reports in the computer trade press say the Mac version of
PalmPilot software is as good, if not better, than its PC
counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   If true, that's great news for the Mac community. The PalmPilot,
which has sold some 2 million-plus units in the past several years,
is the only hand-held computer that lets you back up and
synchronize your personal information on a Mac.
</P>
<P>
   There are scores of alternatives now for PC users, including the
PalmPilot itself. What makes hand-held computers powerful is the
ability to maintain one calendar and Rolodex across many platforms.
That is, with the right software, you can update and synchronize
the same information on a desktop and a hand-held computer.
</P>
<P>
   For PalmPilot, the Mac version of this synchronizing software is
called MacPac. The first version was a clunky replica of the PC
software. Worse, MacPac didn't even work on a lot of Macs.
</P>
<P>
   PalmPilot hopes to improve on that with MacPac 2.0, which is
based on the old Claris Organizer. 3Com bought the popular personal
information manager from Apple Computer earlier this year and
announced it would remake the software for its PalmPilot.
</P>
<P>
   That proved a more difficult task than initially thought. But
the final results are looking good. Says reviewer Jason Snell in
the January issue of MacWorld, ``This new Palm Desktop is Mac
through and through, right down to the Apple-gray interface.''
</P>
<P>
   MacPac 2.0 is not yet ready for commercial release. But you can
download a beta version of it from several sites, including
MacWorld and PalmPilot.
</P>
<P>
   Be forewarned. Beta software is often unstable and can corrupt
both operating systems and other software.

 &HT;    The top 10 Web sites
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As David Letterman proves nightly, everyone loves a
top-ten list. At the end of the year, people love top-ten lists
even more. For the Web, 1998 was quite a year. For what it's worth,
here's my personal top ten Web sites of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   1. Yahoo (http://www.yahoo.com): Still the most popular site on
the Web, what was once just a list of cool links has morphed into a
multimedia empire. Only America Online rivals it in size and scope.
From search to shopping to news, stocks and chat, Yahoo is a force
to be reckoned with for everyone doing business on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   2. The Drudge Report: (http://www.drudgereport.com): Last year,
Matt Drudge was just a punk kid from L.A. dishing the dirt from his
cramped Sunset Boulevard apartment. But that was before he got wind
of Newsweek's story about Monica Lewinsky and the rest, as they
say, is history. Now Drudge is a daily must-read for news
organizations everywhere and the fedora-wearing newshound is
pontificating on his brand of populist journalism at places like
Harvard and the National Press Club. In a year filled with breaking
news, Drudge helped make the Web a major player.
</P>
<P>
   3. Salon Magazine (http://www.salonmagazine.com): The literary
e-zine was already a cult favorite before the relentless attacks on
the Ken Starr investigation and its Henry Hyde expose. The
publicity moved Salon into the limelight where it stays with a
strong mix of news and commentary. It also introduced a voluntary
and novel membership plan as an alternative revenue stream.
</P>
<P>
   4. CNN Interactive, MSNBC, ABCNews.com: Constant updates,
personalization features and the ability to ``stop the presses'' to
make way for breaking news made these the big three of online news.
The rapid response of the net to breaking news such as the Starr
Report or midterm elections proved the Web is one of the best
places to get a quick news fix almost the second it happens.
</P>
<P>
   5. Amazon (http://www.amazon.com): Unless your modem has been
unplugged for the last year, chances are pretty good you've ordered
a book from Amazon.com or know somebody who has. When a friend
remarked he just 'amazoned' a book, and everyone knew what he
meant, it was clear Amazon has become a bookseller and a brand to
be reckoned with.
</P>
<P>
   6. America Online: With 14 million subscribers, 20 million
users, a zillion chat rooms, fascinating and timely message boards,
spam controls and a shopping environment more secure than Fort Knox
and a new deal with Netscape, AOL is a virtual main street of news,
commerce and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   7. Slate (http://www.slate.com): The Microsoft-run, Michael
Kinsley-edited online journal of ideas defied analysts and began
charging for access to most of its content. The magazine showed
real guts and promise late in the year when it dispatched author
Michael Lewis to comment on the Microsoft trial. Lewis' reports
were largely unbiased, colorful accounts that seemed to reinforce
Kinsley's insistence that Microsoft did not influence Slate's
content or editorial decisions. However, Lewis' tenure was
short-lived and he was soon replaced by Slate staffers who admitted
their Microsoft bias, leaving many wondering how much independence
Slate really has.
</P>
<P>
   8: MindSpring (http://www.mindspring.net): It's not really a Web
site, but Atlanta-based MindSpring, one of the largest independent
Internet service providers, has practically become the poster child
for the wild ride Internet stocks have had on Wall Street. Customer
service is good, busy signals are rare and a three-legged dog is
the company mascot. The fact MindSpring is turning a profit is just
icing on the cake.
</P>
<P>
   9: eBay (http://www.ebay.com): Proof positive that people are
willing to buy almost anything on the Web. Consumers are busy
snapping up Brady Bunch lunchboxes, while publishers are wondering
if they should aggressively pursue putting their classified ads on
the Web.
</P>
<P>
   10. Snap: (http://www.snap.com): In the year of the portal it
seemed like everybody wanted to get into the act, including Snap.
Just another anemic little portal site until NBC came along with
big bucks and big ideas, Snap is constantly developing top notch
areas, including a commerce area and a news area that reports news
from the best sources, not just NBC news sources. Snap illustrates
what a little luck and a lot of money can do.
</P>
<P>
   What's Hot
</P>
<P>
   Dark and Stormy Southern Nights: Grab a lantern and take a long
walk down the Moonlit Road, a beautiful site devoted to ghost
stories and folktales from some of the South's best known
storytellers. http://www.themoonlitroad.comYou've Got Mail: The Web
site for the new Tom Hanks/Meg Ryan romantic comedy has a neat Web
site that's interesting and fun.

 &HT;    Unlikely suspect Mercedes-Benz goes hot rod
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When most of us think of hot rods, cars like Z28
Camaros, 5.0 Mustangs or hemi-headed Mopars come to mind. Now
there's a new player in the hot rod segment, and an unusual one at
that.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes-Benz offers perhaps one of the most
performance-oriented lineups in the marketplace. Starting with the
C230 Kompressor sedan, the German automaker seems on a mission to
restore an almost lost commodity to the automotive marketplace _
torque.
</P>
<P>
   Any time torque exceeds horsepower ratings, driving enthusiasts
are pleased. The C230 Kompressor is right on target with 200
pounds-feet of torque and 185 horsepower. A zero-to-60-mph time of
8.1 seconds is nothing to sneeze at in a four-cylinder sedan.
Pricing is also palatable, beginning at $31,200.
</P>
<P>
   Want more? The C280 _ a V-6 equipped C-Class _ has 195
pounds-feet of torque and 194 hp. After a stint on an autocross
with a C280 equipped with the ``sport package,'' I experienced an
exceptionally wide power band and a 5-speed electronically
controlled automatic that will never leave you in search of the
proper gear.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the C280 gobble up the course, it ate the
competition on the clock as well. The C280 pricing begins at
$35,600, and the sport package, which you can add to either the 230
or 280, is $890 and provides a quicker-ratio steering box and
16-inch wheels with 205/55R16 performance tires.
</P>
<P>
   Still not enough? How 'bout strapping into the C43. With a price
of $53,000, the C43 is the cream of the C-Class crop.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes will produce only 1,500 of these super-sedans for U.S.
consumption. For the extra dough, you get exclusivity and a new
302-hp 4.3-liter V-8 engine borrowed from the E430 sedan. The C43
rocks with a zero-60 time of 5.9 seconds. Its top speed of 155 mph
is electronically limited.
</P>
<P>
   The C43 is the ultimate sleeper. What looks like a sedate sedan
will blow away most everything you can encounter at the stoplight.
</P>
<P>
   You would think that would be enough from Santa's Mercedes bag.
But, no, the newly announced E55 is an autobahn burner that will be
introduced in the United States this year.
</P>
<P>
   The E55 is as sedate as an Armani suit _ stylish, well-cut and
understated _ but make no mistake, Hulk Hogan is wearing this
outfit. The E55's 5.5-liter V-8 powerplant produces 349 hp and a
staggering 391 pounds-feet of torque at 3,000 rpm. Zero-to-60 is a
mere 5.4 seconds, and you can still take three friends to lunch in
luxurious comfort.
</P>
<P>
   And what a treat the E55 is to drive. It eats mountain curves,
but this full-sized, four-door hot rod will be hard to get.
Mercedes only plans to import 2,000 over the next four years at a
list price of $69,100.

 &HT;    Free gifts are lurking in crevices of Windows 98
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It probably shouldn't work this way but _ at this time
of the year _ almost everything has a price tag on it. If you are
like me, your credit cards have already worked so hard they're
developing muscles.
</P>
<P>
   That's why we'll spend today looking at my favorite kind of
computer software _ free stuff.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start with some software you already have installed if you
own Windows 98. Now, if you are familiar with Windows at all, you
probably think you know the programs I mean. You're thinking about
the nifty games that come with Windows, or perhaps some of the
utilities such as Scandisk or Defrag. Those are excellent programs,
but I want to introduce you to some strangers that are lurking
around your Start menu or hiding even more skillfully on your
Windows 98 installation disc.
</P>
<P>
   My first candidate is almost certainly already on your hard
disk. It's called Microsoft System Information, and you'll find it
by following this twisting trail. Go to the Start menu, then to
Programs, then to Accessories, then to System Tools and finally to
this program.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have it running, you'll see it provides a window into
the inner workings of your computer. If, for instance, you run into
a conflict that makes it tough to install a new sound card or other
device, you'll find a lot of information here. But, as we used to
say back in the days when I wrote commercials, there's still more.
</P>
<P>
   With the System Information program running, go to the Tools
menu and select Registry Checker. You probably already know that
the Registry is where Windows keeps some of its most basic settings
stored. Problems here can really mess up your computer. When you
start up the Registry Checker, it will also automatically make a
backup copy of these settings.
</P>
<P>
   Now, go back to the Tools menu and select System File Checker.
You'll be given the chance to scan Windows for altered files and
given help automatically restoring an intact version. This tool is
really excellent, and I urge you to use it from time to time. It
also gives you the ability to manually restore files from the
Windows installation disc. If you've ever tried doing that with the
archaic DOS command called Extract, you'll recognize that this
program is worth its weight in RAM chips.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of other useful programs under the Tools menu,
including a Version Conflict Manager and a System Configuration
Utility. Take some time learning about these programs on your own
using the Help menu.
</P>
<P>
   I wish there was time to cover them all, but I want to tell you
about one more free program you already own before I run out of
space.
</P>
<P>
   Editing the Registry is really a complicated mess. And mistakes
can turn your computer into a simpering idiot. There is a program
that can help. However, this program isn't installed on your
computer. You'll need to put your Windows 98 installation disc in
your computer and go to the Tools folder. Continue double-clicking
away into the subdirectories of this folder. Open Reskit and then
open Powertoy. Then find a file named tweakui.inf and click on it
using the right button (make sure to use the right, not the left
button) of your mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Now select Install. Once you have the program called Tweak UI
installed _ and that's what you just did _ you'll get automated
help in editing the Registry file. You'll find ways to change
settings on your computer that can only be edited from within the
Registry.
</P>
<P>
   Even with this tool, Registry editing makes a danged poor hobby.
But at least you'll get familiar-looking Windows screens to make
things easier.
</P>
<P>
   OK. That's my Christmas gift this season _ two free programs
that really can make using Windows 98 easier. If you'd like to
thank me, then do something really radical this holiday season.
Turn the computer off for a few nights and sit next to the
altogether kinder light that comes from your fireplace.

 &HT;    Encarta reference suite comes on single DVD
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ To conclude our look at the latest crop of electronic
encyclopedias, we'll take a very brief glance at the 1999 DVD
version of the Encarta reference suite, and then move on to some
other encylopedic sorts of things.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, the DVD reference suite is nothing more than the
Deluxe Encarta plus Microsoft's very useful Bookshelf and the
Visual Globe. The trick, of course, is that material which takes up
five ordinary CD-ROMs is here presented on one _ with more
multimedia thrown in for good measure.
</P>
<P>
   This may not sound impressive unless you have gone through the
annoying disc-shuffling that rummaging through all the separate
programs would require. I despair of accurately predicting anything
_ I didn't think CNN would last a year and figured the Internet was
a passing fancy _ so I won't tell you DVD is the wave of the
future. I just hope it is.
</P>
<P>
   National Geographic maps available on CD
</P>
<P>
   Some of you (one hopes) may remember last year's milestone in
electronic reference publishing _ the complete, right down to the
last advertisement, National Geographic magazine, from the first
edition to December 1996. Mindscape, the firm which brought that
off, has both kept the faith and upped the ante. A CD-ROM
containing the complete Geographic for 1997 is now available.
</P>
<P>
   And so, in an eight-disc edition new this fall, is every foldout
map National Geographic ever produced. Called National Geographic
maps, the set comes in a little zip-up case for a remarkable price
of $80 or so.
</P>
<P>
   As with the magazine set, the pleasure is not unalloyed. Once
again, all the material here has been scanned in directly from the
original pages. This meant it was less than ideally sharp and
somewhat hard to read.
</P>
<P>
   With the maps, it means they are small and when zoomed up to
readability, can be hard to read, and are also partially obscured
by an overall image of the map that insists on staying where it is.
The maps can be zoomed, but the original size of the image will not
change unless you manually enlarge the window.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if all you want are current maps, you can get better
quality with nearly any electronic atlas or, for North America at
least, with any of the trip-planning programs. But that's not the
point here. In addition to the current maps, there are a great
number of historical, sociological and other kind of maps.
</P>
<P>
   There are also some absorbing features _ milestones of mapping,
a kind of history of cartography and milestones of the magazine
itself.
</P>
<P>
   And _ wonder of wonders _ Hewlett-Packard worked with Mindscape
to produce a means of printing these maps, in their original color
and detail. Of course, this will generally entail either printing
them one per page, which means most will be too tiny to read,
printing a section of a map or printing a map that is tiled onto
several pages.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, this is one more wonderful resource for the
computer.

 &HT;    Leave time for emission testing snags
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Amid the usual plethora of holiday greetings, bills
and catalogs, some of you will be receiving your vehicle
registration renewal notice for next year.
</P>
<P>
   Because 1999 is an odd-numbered year, odd-year vehicles (1975,
1987, 1991, etc.) will need to be emissions tested before new tags
are issued. Most of you are already aware there are two different
kinds of emissions inspection stations. The ``all vehicles
welcome'' stations with dynamometers perform both the two-speed
idle (TSI) and the acceleration simulation mode (ASM). They have
the capability to test all vehicles back to 1975.
</P>
<P>
   However, the ``1993 and newer'' signs for stations performing
only the TSI test may offer some confusion if you are planning to
avoid the rush and get your 1993 vehicle tested early for next
year's tags.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, a 1993 vehicle is considered six years old and no
longer a ``newer vehicle.'' It must be tested at an ``all
vehicles'' test station. The signs don't reflect this because we
are still in the 1998 test year and tag season until Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Mary drives a 1993 Cavalier and must renew her tags
by her birthday, Jan. 2. That means the car needs to be emissions
tested this month so she can mail the paperwork to the tag office.
On Dec. 12, she drives to a ``1993 and newer vehicles'' inspection
station during her lunch hour. After all, she has a 1993 car.
</P>
<P>
   After waiting in line behind two other vehicles, it's her turn.
But the inspector informs her he is not allowed to test her car
because it will be considered more than six years old in 1999 and
he can't test ``older vehicles.'' She must have it tested at an
``all vehicles'' station. Mary drives off, angry and frustrated
because she wasted her lunchtime and still needs to get her car
tested.
</P>
<P>
   Susan's tags for her 1993 Toyota are also due in January. She
takes her car to an ``all vehicles'' station. She is surprised the
car needs a different kind of inspection, the ASM test, instead of
the short TSI test performed in 1997. Before the inspector drives
the car onto the dynamometer, he checks the tire pressure of the
drive wheels and notices the tires are dangerously worn. He informs
Susan she will need to replace the tires with safe ones before he
can test the car.
</P>
<P>
   John's Jan. 3 birthday means he must get a December emission
inspection for his '93 Taurus, but he procrastinates until late in
the month. He goes to the ``all vehicles'' station close to work.
Its ESP test equipment is not working, but it should be fixed by
tomorrow. Not a problem; he has three days. The following morning,
the equipment is still broken. Everyone else who tests ``all
vehicles'' in the area is swamped with fellow procrastinators.
Finally, at 4:30 p.m. on New Year's Eve he races to the ESP station
just as they are getting ready to lock up. The owner takes pity on
him, hands him a beer and tests the car, which passes. He then
speeds to the post office and spends $3 to express mail the
registration paperwork. On the way home he gets stopped for DUI.
His car gets impounded and he spends his birthday in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Please don't let this happen to you. ``1993 and newer vehicles''
test stations cannot test 1993 vehicles for the 1999 tag season. Go
to the right place. Give yourself plenty of time. It might be a
good idea to call ahead to make sure the equipment is operating
and, most importantly, don't drink and drive.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane S. Greig
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: How do you clean that black, crusted carbon-looking stuff on
the inside of glass fireplace screens? Also, my son and I are
``X-Files'' aficionados. Where can I find stuff for Christmas?
_Judi K.
</P>
<P>
   A: Some readers report luck with foaming bathroom cleaner to cut
the cruddy buildup on fireplace glass. Try it on a corner of the
glass to make sure it does not harm it. The glass must cool before
you clean it or it will streak _ permanently. There are cleaners
made specifically for this nasty stuff. ``X-Files'' shirts are on
sale at E! online. Call (888) 855-4979 or visit shop.eonline.com to
order. Want a Scully badge or the show's signature poster from
Mulder's office (``I Want To Believe'')? Contact the International
UFO Museum and Research Center at (800) 822-3545.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many miles does the average person walk in a lifetime?
_R. Walker
</P>
<P>
   A: The average person, according to the American Podiatric
Medical Association, walks an incredible 115,000 miles in a
lifetime (seems like more if your feet hurt). That is more than
four times the length of the equator.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why, oh why, does the symbol on a Volvo appear to be the
universal sign for ``male'' _ you know, a circle with an arrow
pointing out of it? Just wondering.
</P>
<P>
   _L. Tarver
</P>
<P>
   A: Sorry, no fiendish plot. The symbol dates from the Middle
Ages, says the public relations team at Volvo. It is the
alchemists' symbol for iron, frequently seen over the entrance to
iron mines in Europe. Volvo adopted it because of its association
with strength. The car company was founded in the 1920s by Swedes
Assar Gabrielsson and Gustaf Larson, of the SKF ball bearing
company. SKF gave the men ``seed money'' as well as the name
``Volvo'' (meaning ``I roll'' in Latin), from an extinct line of
bearings. What else but a car could use more ball bearings? Smart
guys, Assar and Gustaf. The emblem is currently used only on the
grill. The company did take a little heat from activists in the
1970s who thought the symbol had some hidden, male domination
meaning. Just not so.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Last year you described a Christmas gift-exchange game that
used a version of ``'Twas the Night Before Christmas.'' Would it be
possible for me to get a copy of that? _Margo K.
</P>
<P>
   A: Of course. Players stand in a circle clutching a wrapped
present. They pass gifts (white elephant or otherwise) to the right
or left when the words ``right'' or ``left'' appear in the text. No
one ends up with the gift he brought to the party.
</P>
<P>
   For a copy, check out my name at Austin360.com or send me a
stamped, self-addressed envelope. And to all a good night.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I had the unfortunate experience of having a candle drip wax
onto my sofa. I don't know how to get it removed without further
damage to the fabric. Please let me know if you have a solution.
Also, could you publish this request, because I know I am not the
only person who has done such a bone-headed thing. _L.L.
</P>
<P>
   A: Good idea, since this is candle season and readers usually
find wax stuck to everything from carpet to cashmere. Here is the
process. Remove what you can with a dull knife. Then place the
fabric between two pieces of brown paper or paper towels. I use
grocery bags cut into manageable pieces. With a hair dryer or iron,
gently heat the fabric. A hair dryer is easier to use on furniture.
The wax adheres to the paper. Replace the paper with fresh pieces
and repeat. Eventually you will have only an oil stain, which can
be removed with traditional cleaning _ in the washer, by a dry
cleaner or with upholstery cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In March my VISA card was stolen and a fraudulent charge of
$172.12 came through before the credit card company could recognize
it as stolen. I completed the dispute form and included a letter
with a photocopied receipt clearly showing someone else's name and
signature. The charge is STILL showing up. Over the past eight
months I have logged 30-plus phone calls to all departments of
VISA. Other than a generic ``we're investigating the matter'' form
letter, I have received no replies to my requests. I've spoken with
service reps ad nauseam. I have also called Chase VISA's corporate
offices. The VP of customer service has not responded to my
certified letter. HELP _ I'm stuck in an endless loop! _B.H.
</P>
<P>
   A: You did everything you were supposed to do; Chase VISA
dropped the ball. Judy Miller in Chase's public relations
department has credited your account and apologizes for the delay.
When reporting stolen cards and fraudulent charges, call the
service number on your statement and the fraud division will credit
your account after receiving your written affidavit.

 &HT;    Sites ready to indulge taste for the offbeat
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The trouble with the Internet these days is that it's
so danged practical.
</P>
<P>
   If you're heading for a picnic on Saturday, you can check out
the weather at the Weather Channel at http://www.weather.com. Then
you can drop in at
</P>
<P>
   http://members.xoom.com/KountryCook/sofryck.htm to get a recipe
for the fried chicken you want to bring.
</P>
<P>
   That's all well and good, but the real fun of the Web used to be
exploring pages that were totally useless but loads of fun. There
are only so many chuckles in a forecast that tells you it'll be
partly cloudy on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   So today, we'll take a break from the real world and check out
some sites that are just plain fun.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start with a site that may actually be useful. It's called
Roadside America and calls itself a guide to offbeat vacation
attractions. You'll find the home page at
http://www.roadsideamerica.com/.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've visited the page, you'll know things your friends
and co-workers do not. For instance, you'll discover on the east
side of Baltimore, in the restaurant known as Hausner's, ``there is
a huge ball of string in one of the off-rooms. Visitors to the
restaurant can't see the ball of string unless they go in search of
the restroom and make a wrong turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, in case you ever visit the little town of Norton, Kan., the
page will tell you about a ``picture gallery in the First State
Bank, with pictures of all the men who have run for president and
lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that we have your next vacation planned, let's give you
reason to celebrate. If you love holidays and find Christmas,
Hanukkah and New Year's Eve aren't enough to fill your appetite,
then there is good news for you.
</P>
<P>
   Set your browser for
</P>
<P>
   http://www.jpmorgan.com/cgi-bin/HolidayCalendar and you'll find
yourself at the J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. page devoted to holidays around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Just take any date and use the pull-down menu to set the Web
page to find the holidays for that date. You'll learn, for
instance, that tomorrow (Dec. 14) is a Russian holiday,
Constitution Day. You can also use the pull-down menus to look at
holidays specific to other countries. That way you can learn that,
in Botswana, Dec. 26, is Boxing Day.
</P>
<P>
   If you really want to waste some time, and find some surprises,
try WebCrawler Web Roulette. Just go to
http://www.webcrawler.com/cgi-bin/random and you'll be presented
with links to 10 Web pages selected at random. (Parents should keep
in mind the pages are randomly selected and the possibility exists
of being presented with material of an adult nature).
</P>
<P>
   Next let's take a look at a page called Stupid People, Crime and
Current Events at http://www.mindspring.com/(tilde)iam392/. It is
very much as it sounds, a collection of news stories about crimes
committed by stupid people. For instance, you'll learn about the
Nevada robber who let a convenience store clerk make one phone call
during a hold-up, then seemed surprised when police showed up.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if you really don't have a life at all, you may be
interested in a page devoted to people who collect the toys given
away at fast-food restaurants.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    MacPac tunes up PalmPilot's power
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When it comes to hand-held computers, Mac users had
been playing second fiddle to their PC counterparts. No longer.
</P>
<P>
   3Com is finally readying Mac software for its popular PalmPilot
hand-held computer after months of delay. The software had been
promised by last summer. Oh well.
</P>
<P>
   The delay, however, appears to have been worth the wait. Initial
reports in the computer trade press say the Mac version of
PalmPilot software is as good, if not better, than its PC
counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   If true, that's great news for the Mac community. The PalmPilot,
which has sold some 2 million-plus units in the past several years,
is the only hand-held computer that lets you back up and
synchronize your personal information on a Mac.
</P>
<P>
   There are scores of alternatives now for PC users, including the
PalmPilot itself. What makes hand-held computers powerful is the
ability to maintain one calendar and Rolodex across many platforms.
That is, with the right software, you can update and synchronize
the same information on a desktop and a hand-held computer.
</P>
<P>
   For PalmPilot, the Mac version of this synchronizing software is
called MacPac. The first version was a clunky replica of the PC
software. Worse, MacPac didn't even work on a lot of Macs.
</P>
<P>
   PalmPilot hopes to improve on that with MacPac 2.0, which is
based on the old Claris Organizer. 3Com bought the popular personal
information manager from Apple Computer earlier this year and
announced it would remake the software for its PalmPilot.
</P>
<P>
   That proved a more difficult task than initially thought. But
the final results are looking good. Says reviewer Jason Snell in
the January issue of MacWorld, ``This new Palm Desktop is Mac
through and through, right down to the Apple-gray interface.''
</P>
<P>
   MacPac 2.0 is not yet ready for commercial release. But you can
download a beta version of it from several sites, including
MacWorld and PalmPilot.
</P>
<P>
   Be forewarned. Beta software is often unstable and can corrupt
both operating systems and other software.

 &HT;    The top 10 Web sites
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As David Letterman proves nightly, everyone loves a
top-ten list. At the end of the year, people love top-ten lists
even more. For the Web, 1998 was quite a year. For what it's worth,
here's my personal top ten Web sites of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   1. Yahoo (http://www.yahoo.com): Still the most popular site on
the Web, what was once just a list of cool links has morphed into a
multimedia empire. Only America Online rivals it in size and scope.
From search to shopping to news, stocks and chat, Yahoo is a force
to be reckoned with for everyone doing business on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   2. The Drudge Report: (http://www.drudgereport.com): Last year,
Matt Drudge was just a punk kid from L.A. dishing the dirt from his
cramped Sunset Boulevard apartment. But that was before he got wind
of Newsweek's story about Monica Lewinsky and the rest, as they
say, is history. Now Drudge is a daily must-read for news
organizations everywhere and the fedora-wearing newshound is
pontificating on his brand of populist journalism at places like
Harvard and the National Press Club. In a year filled with breaking
news, Drudge helped make the Web a major player.
</P>
<P>
   3. Salon Magazine (http://www.salonmagazine.com): The literary
e-zine was already a cult favorite before the relentless attacks on
the Ken Starr investigation and its Henry Hyde expose. The
publicity moved Salon into the limelight where it stays with a
strong mix of news and commentary. It also introduced a voluntary
and novel membership plan as an alternative revenue stream.
</P>
<P>
   4. CNN Interactive, MSNBC, ABCNews.com: Constant updates,
personalization features and the ability to ``stop the presses'' to
make way for breaking news made these the big three of online news.
The rapid response of the net to breaking news such as the Starr
Report or midterm elections proved the Web is one of the best
places to get a quick news fix almost the second it happens.
</P>
<P>
   5. Amazon (http://www.amazon.com): Unless your modem has been
unplugged for the last year, chances are pretty good you've ordered
a book from Amazon.com or know somebody who has. When a friend
remarked he just 'amazoned' a book, and everyone knew what he
meant, it was clear Amazon has become a bookseller and a brand to
be reckoned with.
</P>
<P>
   6. America Online: With 14 million subscribers, 20 million
users, a zillion chat rooms, fascinating and timely message boards,
spam controls and a shopping environment more secure than Fort Knox
and a new deal with Netscape, AOL is a virtual main street of news,
commerce and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   7. Slate (http://www.slate.com): The Microsoft-run, Michael
Kinsley-edited online journal of ideas defied analysts and began
charging for access to most of its content. The magazine showed
real guts and promise late in the year when it dispatched author
Michael Lewis to comment on the Microsoft trial. Lewis' reports
were largely unbiased, colorful accounts that seemed to reinforce
Kinsley's insistence that Microsoft did not influence Slate's
content or editorial decisions. However, Lewis' tenure was
short-lived and he was soon replaced by Slate staffers who admitted
their Microsoft bias, leaving many wondering how much independence
Slate really has.
</P>
<P>
   8: MindSpring (http://www.mindspring.net): It's not really a Web
site, but Atlanta-based MindSpring, one of the largest independent
Internet service providers, has practically become the poster child
for the wild ride Internet stocks have had on Wall Street. Customer
service is good, busy signals are rare and a three-legged dog is
the company mascot. The fact MindSpring is turning a profit is just
icing on the cake.
</P>
<P>
   9: eBay (http://www.ebay.com): Proof positive that people are
willing to buy almost anything on the Web. Consumers are busy
snapping up Brady Bunch lunchboxes, while publishers are wondering
if they should aggressively pursue putting their classified ads on
the Web.
</P>
<P>
   10. Snap: (http://www.snap.com): In the year of the portal it
seemed like everybody wanted to get into the act, including Snap.
Just another anemic little portal site until NBC came along with
big bucks and big ideas, Snap is constantly developing top notch
areas, including a commerce area and a news area that reports news
from the best sources, not just NBC news sources. Snap illustrates
what a little luck and a lot of money can do.
</P>
<P>
   What's Hot
</P>
<P>
   Dark and Stormy Southern Nights: Grab a lantern and take a long
walk down the Moonlit Road, a beautiful site devoted to ghost
stories and folktales from some of the South's best known
storytellers. http://www.themoonlitroad.comYou've Got Mail: The Web
site for the new Tom Hanks/Meg Ryan romantic comedy has a neat Web
site that's interesting and fun.

 &HT;    Unlikely suspect Mercedes-Benz goes hot rod
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When most of us think of hot rods, cars like Z28
Camaros, 5.0 Mustangs or hemi-headed Mopars come to mind. Now
there's a new player in the hot rod segment, and an unusual one at
that.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes-Benz offers perhaps one of the most
performance-oriented lineups in the marketplace. Starting with the
C230 Kompressor sedan, the German automaker seems on a mission to
restore an almost lost commodity to the automotive marketplace _
torque.
</P>
<P>
   Any time torque exceeds horsepower ratings, driving enthusiasts
are pleased. The C230 Kompressor is right on target with 200
pounds-feet of torque and 185 horsepower. A zero-to-60-mph time of
8.1 seconds is nothing to sneeze at in a four-cylinder sedan.
Pricing is also palatable, beginning at $31,200.
</P>
<P>
   Want more? The C280 _ a V-6 equipped C-Class _ has 195
pounds-feet of torque and 194 hp. After a stint on an autocross
with a C280 equipped with the ``sport package,'' I experienced an
exceptionally wide power band and a 5-speed electronically
controlled automatic that will never leave you in search of the
proper gear.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the C280 gobble up the course, it ate the
competition on the clock as well. The C280 pricing begins at
$35,600, and the sport package, which you can add to either the 230
or 280, is $890 and provides a quicker-ratio steering box and
16-inch wheels with 205/55R16 performance tires.
</P>
<P>
   Still not enough? How 'bout strapping into the C43. With a price
of $53,000, the C43 is the cream of the C-Class crop.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes will produce only 1,500 of these super-sedans for U.S.
consumption. For the extra dough, you get exclusivity and a new
302-hp 4.3-liter V-8 engine borrowed from the E430 sedan. The C43
rocks with a zero-60 time of 5.9 seconds. Its top speed of 155 mph
is electronically limited.
</P>
<P>
   The C43 is the ultimate sleeper. What looks like a sedate sedan
will blow away most everything you can encounter at the stoplight.
</P>
<P>
   You would think that would be enough from Santa's Mercedes bag.
But, no, the newly announced E55 is an autobahn burner that will be
introduced in the United States this year.
</P>
<P>
   The E55 is as sedate as an Armani suit _ stylish, well-cut and
understated _ but make no mistake, Hulk Hogan is wearing this
outfit. The E55's 5.5-liter V-8 powerplant produces 349 hp and a
staggering 391 pounds-feet of torque at 3,000 rpm. Zero-to-60 is a
mere 5.4 seconds, and you can still take three friends to lunch in
luxurious comfort.
</P>
<P>
   And what a treat the E55 is to drive. It eats mountain curves,
but this full-sized, four-door hot rod will be hard to get.
Mercedes only plans to import 2,000 over the next four years at a
list price of $69,100.

 &HT;    Free gifts are lurking in crevices of Windows 98
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It probably shouldn't work this way but _ at this time
of the year _ almost everything has a price tag on it. If you are
like me, your credit cards have already worked so hard they're
developing muscles.
</P>
<P>
   That's why we'll spend today looking at my favorite kind of
computer software _ free stuff.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start with some software you already have installed if you
own Windows 98. Now, if you are familiar with Windows at all, you
probably think you know the programs I mean. You're thinking about
the nifty games that come with Windows, or perhaps some of the
utilities such as Scandisk or Defrag. Those are excellent programs,
but I want to introduce you to some strangers that are lurking
around your Start menu or hiding even more skillfully on your
Windows 98 installation disc.
</P>
<P>
   My first candidate is almost certainly already on your hard
disk. It's called Microsoft System Information, and you'll find it
by following this twisting trail. Go to the Start menu, then to
Programs, then to Accessories, then to System Tools and finally to
this program.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have it running, you'll see it provides a window into
the inner workings of your computer. If, for instance, you run into
a conflict that makes it tough to install a new sound card or other
device, you'll find a lot of information here. But, as we used to
say back in the days when I wrote commercials, there's still more.
</P>
<P>
   With the System Information program running, go to the Tools
menu and select Registry Checker. You probably already know that
the Registry is where Windows keeps some of its most basic settings
stored. Problems here can really mess up your computer. When you
start up the Registry Checker, it will also automatically make a
backup copy of these settings.
</P>
<P>
   Now, go back to the Tools menu and select System File Checker.
You'll be given the chance to scan Windows for altered files and
given help automatically restoring an intact version. This tool is
really excellent, and I urge you to use it from time to time. It
also gives you the ability to manually restore files from the
Windows installation disc. If you've ever tried doing that with the
archaic DOS command called Extract, you'll recognize that this
program is worth its weight in RAM chips.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of other useful programs under the Tools menu,
including a Version Conflict Manager and a System Configuration
Utility. Take some time learning about these programs on your own
using the Help menu.
</P>
<P>
   I wish there was time to cover them all, but I want to tell you
about one more free program you already own before I run out of
space.
</P>
<P>
   Editing the Registry is really a complicated mess. And mistakes
can turn your computer into a simpering idiot. There is a program
that can help. However, this program isn't installed on your
computer. You'll need to put your Windows 98 installation disc in
your computer and go to the Tools folder. Continue double-clicking
away into the subdirectories of this folder. Open Reskit and then
open Powertoy. Then find a file named tweakui.inf and click on it
using the right button (make sure to use the right, not the left
button) of your mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Now select Install. Once you have the program called Tweak UI
installed _ and that's what you just did _ you'll get automated
help in editing the Registry file. You'll find ways to change
settings on your computer that can only be edited from within the
Registry.
</P>
<P>
   Even with this tool, Registry editing makes a danged poor hobby.
But at least you'll get familiar-looking Windows screens to make
things easier.
</P>
<P>
   OK. That's my Christmas gift this season _ two free programs
that really can make using Windows 98 easier. If you'd like to
thank me, then do something really radical this holiday season.
Turn the computer off for a few nights and sit next to the
altogether kinder light that comes from your fireplace.

 &HT;    Encarta reference suite comes on single DVD
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ To conclude our look at the latest crop of electronic
encyclopedias, we'll take a very brief glance at the 1999 DVD
version of the Encarta reference suite, and then move on to some
other encylopedic sorts of things.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, the DVD reference suite is nothing more than the
Deluxe Encarta plus Microsoft's very useful Bookshelf and the
Visual Globe. The trick, of course, is that material which takes up
five ordinary CD-ROMs is here presented on one _ with more
multimedia thrown in for good measure.
</P>
<P>
   This may not sound impressive unless you have gone through the
annoying disc-shuffling that rummaging through all the separate
programs would require. I despair of accurately predicting anything
_ I didn't think CNN would last a year and figured the Internet was
a passing fancy _ so I won't tell you DVD is the wave of the
future. I just hope it is.
</P>
<P>
   National Geographic maps available on CD
</P>
<P>
   Some of you (one hopes) may remember last year's milestone in
electronic reference publishing _ the complete, right down to the
last advertisement, National Geographic magazine, from the first
edition to December 1996. Mindscape, the firm which brought that
off, has both kept the faith and upped the ante. A CD-ROM
containing the complete Geographic for 1997 is now available.
</P>
<P>
   And so, in an eight-disc edition new this fall, is every foldout
map National Geographic ever produced. Called National Geographic
maps, the set comes in a little zip-up case for a remarkable price
of $80 or so.
</P>
<P>
   As with the magazine set, the pleasure is not unalloyed. Once
again, all the material here has been scanned in directly from the
original pages. This meant it was less than ideally sharp and
somewhat hard to read.
</P>
<P>
   With the maps, it means they are small and when zoomed up to
readability, can be hard to read, and are also partially obscured
by an overall image of the map that insists on staying where it is.
The maps can be zoomed, but the original size of the image will not
change unless you manually enlarge the window.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if all you want are current maps, you can get better
quality with nearly any electronic atlas or, for North America at
least, with any of the trip-planning programs. But that's not the
point here. In addition to the current maps, there are a great
number of historical, sociological and other kind of maps.
</P>
<P>
   There are also some absorbing features _ milestones of mapping,
a kind of history of cartography and milestones of the magazine
itself.
</P>
<P>
   And _ wonder of wonders _ Hewlett-Packard worked with Mindscape
to produce a means of printing these maps, in their original color
and detail. Of course, this will generally entail either printing
them one per page, which means most will be too tiny to read,
printing a section of a map or printing a map that is tiled onto
several pages.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, this is one more wonderful resource for the
computer.

 &HT;    Leave time for emission testing snags
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Amid the usual plethora of holiday greetings, bills
and catalogs, some of you will be receiving your vehicle
registration renewal notice for next year.
</P>
<P>
   Because 1999 is an odd-numbered year, odd-year vehicles (1975,
1987, 1991, etc.) will need to be emissions tested before new tags
are issued. Most of you are already aware there are two different
kinds of emissions inspection stations. The ``all vehicles
welcome'' stations with dynamometers perform both the two-speed
idle (TSI) and the acceleration simulation mode (ASM). They have
the capability to test all vehicles back to 1975.
</P>
<P>
   However, the ``1993 and newer'' signs for stations performing
only the TSI test may offer some confusion if you are planning to
avoid the rush and get your 1993 vehicle tested early for next
year's tags.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, a 1993 vehicle is considered six years old and no
longer a ``newer vehicle.'' It must be tested at an ``all
vehicles'' test station. The signs don't reflect this because we
are still in the 1998 test year and tag season until Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Mary drives a 1993 Cavalier and must renew her tags
by her birthday, Jan. 2. That means the car needs to be emissions
tested this month so she can mail the paperwork to the tag office.
On Dec. 12, she drives to a ``1993 and newer vehicles'' inspection
station during her lunch hour. After all, she has a 1993 car.
</P>
<P>
   After waiting in line behind two other vehicles, it's her turn.
But the inspector informs her he is not allowed to test her car
because it will be considered more than six years old in 1999 and
he can't test ``older vehicles.'' She must have it tested at an
``all vehicles'' station. Mary drives off, angry and frustrated
because she wasted her lunchtime and still needs to get her car
tested.
</P>
<P>
   Susan's tags for her 1993 Toyota are also due in January. She
takes her car to an ``all vehicles'' station. She is surprised the
car needs a different kind of inspection, the ASM test, instead of
the short TSI test performed in 1997. Before the inspector drives
the car onto the dynamometer, he checks the tire pressure of the
drive wheels and notices the tires are dangerously worn. He informs
Susan she will need to replace the tires with safe ones before he
can test the car.
</P>
<P>
   John's Jan. 3 birthday means he must get a December emission
inspection for his '93 Taurus, but he procrastinates until late in
the month. He goes to the ``all vehicles'' station close to work.
Its ESP test equipment is not working, but it should be fixed by
tomorrow. Not a problem; he has three days. The following morning,
the equipment is still broken. Everyone else who tests ``all
vehicles'' in the area is swamped with fellow procrastinators.
Finally, at 4:30 p.m. on New Year's Eve he races to the ESP station
just as they are getting ready to lock up. The owner takes pity on
him, hands him a beer and tests the car, which passes. He then
speeds to the post office and spends $3 to express mail the
registration paperwork. On the way home he gets stopped for DUI.
His car gets impounded and he spends his birthday in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Please don't let this happen to you. ``1993 and newer vehicles''
test stations cannot test 1993 vehicles for the 1999 tag season. Go
to the right place. Give yourself plenty of time. It might be a
good idea to call ahead to make sure the equipment is operating
and, most importantly, don't drink and drive.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane S. Greig
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: How do you clean that black, crusted carbon-looking stuff on
the inside of glass fireplace screens? Also, my son and I are
``X-Files'' aficionados. Where can I find stuff for Christmas?
_Judi K.
</P>
<P>
   A: Some readers report luck with foaming bathroom cleaner to cut
the cruddy buildup on fireplace glass. Try it on a corner of the
glass to make sure it does not harm it. The glass must cool before
you clean it or it will streak _ permanently. There are cleaners
made specifically for this nasty stuff. ``X-Files'' shirts are on
sale at E! online. Call (888) 855-4979 or visit shop.eonline.com to
order. Want a Scully badge or the show's signature poster from
Mulder's office (``I Want To Believe'')? Contact the International
UFO Museum and Research Center at (800) 822-3545.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many miles does the average person walk in a lifetime?
_R. Walker
</P>
<P>
   A: The average person, according to the American Podiatric
Medical Association, walks an incredible 115,000 miles in a
lifetime (seems like more if your feet hurt). That is more than
four times the length of the equator.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why, oh why, does the symbol on a Volvo appear to be the
universal sign for ``male'' _ you know, a circle with an arrow
pointing out of it? Just wondering.
</P>
<P>
   _L. Tarver
</P>
<P>
   A: Sorry, no fiendish plot. The symbol dates from the Middle
Ages, says the public relations team at Volvo. It is the
alchemists' symbol for iron, frequently seen over the entrance to
iron mines in Europe. Volvo adopted it because of its association
with strength. The car company was founded in the 1920s by Swedes
Assar Gabrielsson and Gustaf Larson, of the SKF ball bearing
company. SKF gave the men ``seed money'' as well as the name
``Volvo'' (meaning ``I roll'' in Latin), from an extinct line of
bearings. What else but a car could use more ball bearings? Smart
guys, Assar and Gustaf. The emblem is currently used only on the
grill. The company did take a little heat from activists in the
1970s who thought the symbol had some hidden, male domination
meaning. Just not so.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Last year you described a Christmas gift-exchange game that
used a version of ``'Twas the Night Before Christmas.'' Would it be
possible for me to get a copy of that? _Margo K.
</P>
<P>
   A: Of course. Players stand in a circle clutching a wrapped
present. They pass gifts (white elephant or otherwise) to the right
or left when the words ``right'' or ``left'' appear in the text. No
one ends up with the gift he brought to the party.
</P>
<P>
   For a copy, check out my name at Austin360.com or send me a
stamped, self-addressed envelope. And to all a good night.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I had the unfortunate experience of having a candle drip wax
onto my sofa. I don't know how to get it removed without further
damage to the fabric. Please let me know if you have a solution.
Also, could you publish this request, because I know I am not the
only person who has done such a bone-headed thing. _L.L.
</P>
<P>
   A: Good idea, since this is candle season and readers usually
find wax stuck to everything from carpet to cashmere. Here is the
process. Remove what you can with a dull knife. Then place the
fabric between two pieces of brown paper or paper towels. I use
grocery bags cut into manageable pieces. With a hair dryer or iron,
gently heat the fabric. A hair dryer is easier to use on furniture.
The wax adheres to the paper. Replace the paper with fresh pieces
and repeat. Eventually you will have only an oil stain, which can
be removed with traditional cleaning _ in the washer, by a dry
cleaner or with upholstery cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In March my VISA card was stolen and a fraudulent charge of
$172.12 came through before the credit card company could recognize
it as stolen. I completed the dispute form and included a letter
with a photocopied receipt clearly showing someone else's name and
signature. The charge is STILL showing up. Over the past eight
months I have logged 30-plus phone calls to all departments of
VISA. Other than a generic ``we're investigating the matter'' form
letter, I have received no replies to my requests. I've spoken with
service reps ad nauseam. I have also called Chase VISA's corporate
offices. The VP of customer service has not responded to my
certified letter. HELP _ I'm stuck in an endless loop! _B.H.
</P>
<P>
   A: You did everything you were supposed to do; Chase VISA
dropped the ball. Judy Miller in Chase's public relations
department has credited your account and apologizes for the delay.
When reporting stolen cards and fraudulent charges, call the
service number on your statement and the fraud division will credit
your account after receiving your written affidavit.

   LANE-COLUMN _ A good cat and a good car have roughly the same
life span. Actually, a good car and a good cat share a lot of other

purr when they're happy and neither leaves messes on the floor.
Neither one will burst into flames unexpectedly. But no matter how
good a car or cat is, both start reaching their design limits after
about 15 years. And that's why I found myself sadly walking from a
junkyard recently after selling out a faithful, 15-year-old,
198,000-mile car. (Lane, Cox News Service) MOVED

shut the door. ``Thank you,'' came the tinny voice. That was our

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: The zealots' express rolls on
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The only whistle that might stop the House impeachment
train _ the zealots' express _ is corporate America. Wall Street.
When business talks, Republicans listen.
</P>
<P>
   If the respected Robert Rubin, secretary of the Treasury, gets
on the horn to big funders of conservative politicians, Speaker
Newt Gingrich and Speaker-to- be Bob Livingston might stop playing
dead. They might stop letting GOP Whip Tom Delay of Texas, who's
filling the leadership void, twist the arms of moderates. No
constitutional whiz, Delay says voting articles of impeachment is
simply a tougher form of censure. Even DeLay might listen to Big
Oil.
</P>
<P>
   Crass tactics? On a par with the crassness of a Linda Tripp, a
Kenneth Starr and a former Georgia prosecutor on Starr's staff,
Bruce Udolf. Udolf is the man who was fined by a federal judge for
violating a citizen's constitutional rights with his unethical
tactics. Udolf was one member of the Starr team who told Monica
Lewinsky, when prosecutors first detained her, that her lawyer in a
civil case couldn't help her. The former Gainesville, Ga., district
attorney actually had a man thrown in jail on a bogus charge to try
to coerce testimony from him. A federal judge fined him $50,000,
ruling a prosecutor's immunity wouldn't protect him from
constitutional violations. Starr hired him 10 years later anyhow.
</P>
<P>
   But nevermind the prosecutors and the lawyers. This battle will
be won or lost on the same factors that win or lose campaigns _
partisan pressure and lobbying. That's where the corporate donors
come in. They may not love Clinton, but they love the economic
climate he's helped create. And they aren't willing to risk market
instability to bring him down.
</P>
<P>
   If the partisan hatred for Clinton can't be overcome by the
American people saying they don't want their vote overturned _
maybe big money lobbies can stop it.
</P>
<P>
   There's no enthusiasm for defending the president's sins. A look
at the strongly worded Democratic censure resolution confirms that.
And Clinton's personal reputation isn't worth saving. But the
country and the Constitution are. So is the national interest that
should weigh as heavily on the minds of conscientious decision
makers (the few around) as whether lying under oath about sex is an
impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   For the few representatives who will strive for independent
courage under pressure, here's my favorite historical model: Daniel
Webster's March 7, 1851 vote to save the union and fend off
Southern secession another decade.
</P>
<P>
   Webster abhorred slavery. But he supported a compromise offered
by Henry Clay that was silent on whether the new Western
territories must prohibit slavery. No Northern Whig concurred with
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish to speak not as a Massachusetts man, nor as a Northern
man, but as an American,'' he said. ``I speak today for
preservation of the Union.'' Historian Henry Steele Commager called
Webster's words an example of ``the highest statesmanship.''
</P>
<P>
   Abhorrent as the president's behavior was, it did not subvert
government institutions. The constitutional process will be forever
changed by the House vote to impeach on moral grounds whether the
Senate goes through with a trial or not.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street could save us. But it would be better for the
country if political courage did.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Britain's Monty dispatched to docket of revisionism
 &HT;    (For release Wednesday, Dec. 16, 1998.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The rewriting of World War II and its immediate
aftermath continues at a furious pace. Begun shortly after the
conclusion of hostilities in 1945, the revisions have encompassed
subjects as varying as the reasons for the turn of certain battles,
Dwight Eisenhower's imputed love affair with his British driver,
and the institutional corruption associated with the confiscation
of funds and property from Europe's Jews during that deadly period.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most dramatic _ and therefore more attractive to the
media _ have been situations involving the Jewish condition during
that war.
</P>
<P>
   It often is said that the winners write the history books on
wars, and by and large they do. But it takes awhile for all of the
story to slip out. Even today, as 1998 draws to a close, particles
of information continue to spew forth from documents long
sequestered in musty files of the winners.
</P>
<P>
   When the 1970 epic film ``Patton'' was released, there was not a
word in it about well-documented evidence that the great Army
commander was a virulent anti-Semite who favored the fallen Nazi
guards over their former Jewish inmates. Indeed, it was that fact
that played the single most important role in Eisenhower's sacking
Patton.
</P>
<P>
   George Patton has long been an American hero. There was no
greater fighting general. Yet, whenever his name is mentioned in
the presence of a Jew, the ugly memory of Patton's biases surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   And, now, his greatest battlefield competitor, an ally no less,
has been unclothed in much the same vein. British Field Marshal
Bernard Montgomery, according to Great Britain's Jewish Chronicle
newspaper of Dec. 11, sought to have the Jews striving for a
national homeland in 1946 ``completely and utterly'' defeated in
that effort.
</P>
<P>
   If Patton was America's most beloved fighting man, Montgomery
was Great Britain's. Accusations such as that can sully his legacy
but only slightly, as it did Patton's.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, a letter written by Montgomery and recently
discovered in England's Public Record Office does show Monty of a
mind to deal harshly with Jewish refugees. Among his postwar
assignments was to monitor illegal movements of Jews from Europe to
Palestine. At times, interdictions of Jewish refugees led to
violence and Monty had to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means war with the illegal Jewish army with all that that
implies,'' the 1946 Montgomery letter says in part. ``The Jew is
clever and cunning. He is likely to refuse to engage in pitched
battles with our troops; instead he will go in for sabotage and
kidnapping and generally will try to exhaust our patience.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is precisely what Jewish nationalist movements did, and
successfully.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery's letter warned that the death sentence may have to
be imposed on some Jews, or we ``will lay up for ourselves great
trouble in the future. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Are these the words of an anti-Semite, or of a field general
assessing a military circumstance?
</P>
<P>
   This will be left open to interpretation, and I can pretty well
guess that among Jews he'll be seen in negative tones, among
non-Jews as a man carrying out his responsibility against what then
was seen as Jewish terrorist organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, however, how will we remember men such as Ike,
Patton and Montgomery? Will they be memorialized for what came out
of World War II's wastebaskets, or for what they accomplished
against the common enemy, Nazi Germany?
</P>
<P>
   As worldwide journalism continues to revel in revisionism, more
of this is likely. It is the stuff of somewhat skewed headlines.
Such as that which topped the front page of the Jewish Chronicle:
``Monty Wanted Jews Executed.''

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: Where have you gone, Archie Moore?
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are some people you never think of in terms of dying.
Archie Moore, the former light-heavyweight boxing champion, was one
of them. His 84-year-old heart finally gave out the other day.
Where have you gone, Archie Moore, the nation turns its lonely eyes
to you, goes the song _ approximately.
</P>
<P>
   Archie Moore _ he was always Archie Moore to me, never just
Moore _ was probably best memorialized in the late A.J. Liebling's
New Yorker essay on his 1955 fight with Rocky Marciano. Archie
Moore, Liebling tells us, had learned that any boxer would go if
hit right. In the second round, Archie Moore hit Marciano right
with a perfect combination. Rocky went down. Archie Moore walked
calmly to a corner. When he turned around he saw Marciano getting
up. The look in Archie Moore's eyes, Liebling tells us, said it was
over. Seven rounds later, Marciano knocked him out.
</P>
<P>
   Archie Moore gave me the best night of sports I've ever known.
It was his 1958 fight with Yvon Durelle, the Canadian light-heavy.
Durelle knocked Archie Moore down four times in the early rounds.
Then Archie Moore started coming back, punishing Durelle with left
jabs. He knocked Durelle out in the 11th. It was the most amazing
demonstration of courage in sports I have ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I know boxing is brutal and dehumanizing and ought to be
outlawed. But what would we have done without Benny Leonard, Joe
Louis, Rocky Marciano, Muhammad Ali?
</P>
<P>
   And Archie Moore.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Schippers' sarcastic rant sums it up
 &HT;    Eds: The following column moved Friday as a suggested timely
substitution for the column that moved Thursday. It is moving again
for those who need it.
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his summation of the case against President Clinton, David
Schippers, prosecuting attorney for the Republican majority, hit
just the right note to end the Judiciary Committee's impeachment
hearings and cap the six years' pursuit of the president that had
led to them: Sour. Rank.
</P>
<P>
   Not content to lay out the evidence and coach the committee in
the conclusions he believed the evidence would justify, Schippers
was by turns sneering, sarcastic, contemptuous and mocking toward
the president _ in the service, he oddly insisted, of preserving
the dignity of the office.
</P>
<P>
   Even Americans who judge the case properly fatal to the Clinton
presidency should be unnerved by the obvious venom of Schippers'
chosen rhetoric _ carried to the point of, in effect, counseling
other governments never again to trust Clinton's word as president.
(A nice little service to the republic, that.)
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yes, the lawyer salted his performance with expressions of
regret at his unpleasant duty, but his every attitude shouted a
contrary relish for his own studied excesses. This was not the
sober, measured summing up that so solemn a constitutional moment
called for. It was a barroom peroration, with Clinton _ at long
last, for the eager claque of his committed haters _ as scheming,
devious, sexually wanton and endlessly lawless. Clinton as pure
evil.
</P>
<P>
   That is the Clinton hunted from the moment of his first election
by a richly bankrolled and indefatigable array of right-wing
political operatives, fax-driven radio ranters and evangelical
personality assassins. And, of course, crucially, the Clinton
submitted, uniquely among presidents, to a permanent special
prosecution peculiarly licensed to chase every howl sent up by the
hounds.
</P>
<P>
   It should disturb every American _ as it does most, at least
most outside Congress _ that at the end Clinton and the nation have
been brought to constitutional crisis by a trap set for the
president by a politically scheming book agent manipulating an
avaricious tattle and using the (witting? unwitting?) special
prosecutor to service a meritless lawsuit that conservative
activists had provoked Paula Jones to file.
</P>
<P>
   The House will be judging not just Clinton but his pursuers and
their pursuit as well. Impeachment not only would propose the
ultimate sanction for the president's misdeeds but would endorse _
and, endorsing, install as a permanent and devastating feature of
our political life _ the disturbing means by which they were
brought to light.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lies and other misbehaviors in the Lewinsky
matter do count; they warrant the stinging and humiliating rebuke
in the strong censure proposed by Democrats. Schippers' rant to the
contrary notwithstanding, what we have here is not an
out-of-control president, as we had in Richard Nixon, but an errant
husband trying to tiptoe back into the house at 4 in the morning
and tripping over the furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Do we take down two elections for that?

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Court's winking at privacy issues an odd tack for
conservative justices
 &HT;    Eds: The following column originally moved Thursday and is
moving again for those who used the suggested substitute column on
Schippers that moved Friday.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court justices in a recent ruling seemed
shocked, shocked that Iowa police had got it into their heads they
could search any drivers and cars they pulled over for routine
traffic violations. But the court needed only to look at its own
rulings in recent years to see where the idea came from that
privacy claims have little standing against the claims of law
enforcement convenience.
</P>
<P>
   The court's record of indifference to privacy issues is not
perfect but it leans heavily against any but the most narrow and
literal readings of the Constitution's Fourth Amendment guarantees.
The court has been winking for years at supposedly forbidden
``unreasonable searches and seizures'' that violate the ``right of
the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and
effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the justices needed to refer back only a week to their
ruling that guests in your home don't enjoy the protection that you
do from warrantless police searches. Perhaps overnight guests
would, some justices said, but not day visitors, a distinction
notable mainly for its arbitrariness. Your home may still be your
castle, but it could become a dungeon for drop-ins.
</P>
<P>
   As the court became more conservative with Reagan and Bush
appointees _ a condition little changed by Clinton's two _ it came
to favor the power of the state over the liberty of individuals.
(An odd tack for conservatism, one would think, but there you are.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1986 the justices held that governments can outlaw and punish
even the homebound, consensual exercise of sex acts a legislative
majority chooses to proscribe. It would be difficult to imagine a
more intrusive extension of police power.
</P>
<P>
   The court has been increasingly indulgent of forced drug tests
in schools and workplaces even when no drug use is suspected. It
has shrugged off schoolhouse strip-searches of students. In an Ohio
case, the court endorsed the search of the car of a driver arrested
for speeding _ an obvious precursor to the Iowa law that permitted
such searches for any traffic stop.
</P>
<P>
   That broad grant of police power finally was too much for the
court. It meant anyone driving in Iowa was subject to a search for
criminal evidence at any officer's whim. All that was required was
an officer's willingness to write a ticket charging the driver with
fudging a red light, creeping through a stop sign, beating the
speed limit by a few miles. Officers could, in practice, stop and
search motorists for spite, sport or just because they didn't like
a driver's looks.
</P>
<P>
   The latest ruling gives only feeble cause for encouragement. Its
unanimity shows that the justices do, at the extreme, have some
sort of gag reflex against privacy violations, but the justices
made only a very fine distinction, one between searching drivers
``arrested'' for a traffic violation (OK) and merely ticketed (not
OK).
</P>
<P>
   The justices show no inclination to rethink their burdening body
of decisions that have steadily narrowed the zones and conditions
in which Americans can reasonably expect to be shielded from the
rummaging intrusions of a nosey state.

GOP LOWERS IMPEACHMENT STANDARD, IMPERILS PRESIDENCY

<P>
   The Republicans in the House Judiciary Committee made it clear
Friday that the impeachment action against President Clinton is a
payback for the impeachment articles drawn up against Republican
President Nixon. Nothing more, nothing less.
</P>
<P>
   Committee member Rep. Howard Coble, R-N.C., gleefully pointed
this out in his reference to the Nixon impeachment when the
Democrats were in the majority in Congress: ``It's a lot easier to
throw grenades than to catch them.''
</P>
<P>
   The GOP's need for revenge was going to corner a Democratic
president, any Democratic president _ when the time was right, when
the GOP controlled the Congress. It happened to be Clinton _ for
his foolish liaison and for being so embarrassed by it when it was
discovered that he couldn't be forthright in admitting his sexual
escapade.
</P>
<P>
   And so on Dec. 11, 1998, for only the third time in this
nation's history, articles of impeachment were drawn up against a
president _ Andrew Johnson in 1868, Richard Nixon in 1974 and now
William Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's action embroils America in a serious
constitutional crisis. Unless the U.S. House votes against the
articles of impeachment, Clinton's trial in the Senate will end up
degrading the prestige of the office of the president and tilting
the balance of powers toward an imperial Congress.
</P>
<P>
   A key question rang out all week long during the judiciary
committee's hearings: Does Clinton's sexual infidelity and his
lying about it constitute what the U.S. Constitution, Article II,
Section 4 calls ``other high crimes and misdemeanors''? No, say the
committee Democrats, constitutional scholars, and a majority of the
American public. Yes, shout the Republican committee members. The
Republicans outnumber the Democrats on the committee 21 to 16.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who chairs the judiciary committee, has
a ticklish dilemma. He was involved with a married woman 30 years
ago and broke up the woman's marriage. Undoubtedly, he must have
lied many times about and during that lengthy affair. Hyde, too,
was married at the time. Her husband has neither forgotten nor
forgiven Hyde _ for what Hyde glibly calls a youthful indiscretion.
And now Hyde sits in judgment of a man who also had an affair.
Apparently, Hyde doesn't mind throwing the first stone.
</P>
<P>
   Friday afternoon, Clinton was charged with the first article of
impeachment _ that he had committed perjury in his testimony to a
federal grand jury investigating his relationship to Monica
Lewinsky. The vote went down party lines _ 21 to 16.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later, the committee voted for a second article of
impeachment _ accusing Clinton of committing perjury by his
testimony in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit. The vote
went down party lines _ 20 to 17. Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who
could not support an impeachment charge for lying in a civil
lawsuit, voted with the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In the evening, a third article of impeachment was adopted by a
party-line vote, 21 to 16. It accuses Clinton of obstructing
justice in the Jones lawsuit and cites seven instances when Clinton
attempted to ``delay, impede, cover up and conceal'' evidence in
the case. This article echoes the language used in the first
article of impeachment against Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   The House committee then adjourned after nine hours of partisan
wrangling.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the committee added a fourth article of impeachment
on a straight party-line vote _ charging the president with abuse
of power for not responding honestly to the committee's 81
questions.
</P>
<P>
   The charges sound serious, but federal prosecutors who testified
before the judiciary committee stated that the evidence of perjury
presented by special prosecutor Kenneth Starr would not be
sufficient to seek a criminal indictment. The other charges are
merely high-sounding fluff.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress were to begin impeachment hearings against every
president who had illicit sexual affairs while in office and lied
about it, easily a third of all our presidents would have faced
impeachment. If every president who lied to the American people
over foreign and domestic policies and federal actions were to face
impeachment, no president would finish a term in office.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the lying behind the Iran-Contra, drugs-for-weapons
affair, the presidential lies to cover up our bungling in the
Vietnam War, the misleading statements about why we were involved
in the Gulf War, the lies about the accuracy of our weaponry in
that war.
</P>
<P>
   The founding fathers intended impeachment for only the greatest
offenses _ treason, bribery, misapplication of funds, abuse of
official power, and neglect of duty _ not for covering up an
adulterous affair. They did not intend the impeachment power to be
used to overturn the results of an election _ unless the
president's actions were destroying the very foundation of our
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee has significantly lowered the
impeachment standard. If upheld, these articles of impeachment will
imperil every president who faces a Congress dominated by the
opposing party. The new standard weakens the presidency _ and
throws the checks and balances among the three branches of
government into disarray.
</P>
<P>
   History will not be kind to those who engineered this dangerous
political revenge _ neither should the American voters.

`OUT OF SIGHT' WINS WITH BOSTON CRITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ ``Out of Sight,'' a frisky crime-caper movie based on
an Elmore Leonard novel that found favor with critics but not with
audiences, was named best film of 1998 by the Boston Film Critics
Society at its annual meeting Sunday. It edged out John Boorman's
Irish crime movie, ``The General,'' and Steven Spielberg's odds-on
Oscar favorite, ``Saving Private Ryan.'' Janusz Kaminski's best
cinematography award was the only win for ``Saving Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   The voting was reversed in the best director category. Boorman
took that award, finishing ahead of Steven Soderbergh, the ``Out of
Sight'' helmer. Italy's Roberto Begnini was second runner-up for
``Life Is Beautiful,'' his improbably charming and life-affirming
Holocaust fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Gleeson was named best actor for his portrayals of
Dublin crimelord and anti-authoritarian folk hero Martin Cahill in
``The General'' and a trouble-prone thug in another Irish gangster
film, ``I Went Down.'' He finished ahead of George Clooney's
whimsical thief in ``Out of Sight'' and John Hurt's English
professor obsessed with a young actor in ``Love and Death on Long
Island.''
</P>
<P>
   Samantha Morton was cited as best actress for her riveting
portrait of a young woman grieving for her dead mother in
loose-cannon fashion in a little-seen British film, Carine Adler's
``Under the Skin.'' Ally Sheedy's neurasthenic photographer in Lisa
Cholodenko's ``High Art'' was runner-up. Cate Blanchett's evolving
Queen Elizabeth I in ``Elizabeth'' and Jane Horrocks's agoraphobic
vocal impersonator in ``Little Voice'' were tied for second
runner-up.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the supporting acting award winners are better known
to the public than the leading acting winners. Joan Allen was cited
for her mix of dread and excitement as the perfect '50s TV sitcom
mom shoved into colorful change in ``Pleasantville.'' Runners-up
were Patricia Clarkson for her unhappy German artist in ``High
Art'' and Bridget Fonda for her small-town wife affected by her
husband's discovery of tainted money in ``A Simple Plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Bob Thornton was named best supporting actor for playing
the simpler but more soulful of the two brothers who stumble onto
the money in a snowy field in ``A Simple Plan.'' Tied as runners-up
were Stephen Rea for his imploded Irish father in ``The Butcher
Boy,'' Robert De Niro for his updated criminal benefactor in the
``Great Expectations'' remake, and William H. Macy for roles in
``Pleasantville,'' ``A Civil Action,'' and the ``Psycho'' remake.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Frank won the best screenplay award for his adaptation of
Leonard's novel in ``Out of Sight,'' finishing ahead of Tom
Stoppard's witty script for ``Shakespeare in Love'' and the four
writers who fashioned the screenplay for the lowbrow hit ``There's
Something About Mary.'' Finishing behind Kaminski in the best
cinematography voting were John Lindley for ``Pleasantville'' and
Alar Kavilo for ``A Simple Plan.''
</P>
<P>
   The best foreign language award went to Abbas Kiarostami's ``A
Taste of Cherry,'' a nod not only to Kiarostami but to Iranian
cinema's emerging importance. Thomas Vinterberg's ``The
Celebration,'' a scathing family portrait from another Danish
director of the deglamorizing school of filmmaking that produced
``Breaking the Waves'' a few years ago was next, followed by ``Life
Is Beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Moore's essay in corporate muckraking, ``The Big One,''
was named best documentary. Also cited were Tim Kirkland's ``Dear
Jesse,'' taking on North Carolina Senator Jesse Helms, and ``Theme:
Murder,'' Martha Swetzoff's personal documentary examining the
unsolved murder of her father.

<P>
   WOODEN-TOYS (East Galway, N.Y.) _ There is the interactive world

hundreds of wooden trains, race cars, trucks and helicopters. By
MICHAEL LOPEZ.
</P>
<P>
   PET-VODKA (Undated) _ One of the more peculiar pairings we've

   GLF-CHRISTMAS (San Francisco) _ If you've just found this column

every price range, and most gifts can be ordered from catalogs and
by the Internet, as well as from retailers and pro shops. Here's
the top 10 for just about any year and just about any handicap. By
SUSAN FORNOFF.
</P>
<P>

   OUTDOORS-COLUMN (South Lake Tahoe, Nev.) _ Though the winter

and the predicted mini-apocalypse of the Y2K computer glitch, and
suddenly a lot of people are checking their battery supply. By ROB
MORSE.
</P>
<P>
   LYNCH-COLUMN (Albany, N.Y.) _ Were he to quit now, given all the
suckers around, Bill Clinton's approval rating might go up more.
Clinton could end up like Andrew Johnson, whose enemies in Congress
are recalled by history as venal, vindictive losers. Remember,
though, everybody thought Richard Nixon would go down sword in
hand. Instead, he left office with a prudent whimper. By DAN LYNCH.
</P>
<P>
   SALTER-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Because she is the coauthor of a
book about women's friendships, people ask Tamara Traeder what she
thinks of Linda Tripp and her secret phone tapes. ``When that news
got out, you could hear women gasp all over America,'' Traeder
says. She's right. Anyone who violates sacred trust between
girlfriends ought to be impeached _ from the human race. By
STEPHANIE SALTER.
</P>
<P>
   FLORES-COLUMN (San Antonio) _ Advocates for the hungry and
homeless appreciate the attention they get this time of year, but
they await the donation drought that is just around the corner.
It's as if hearts _ and pockets _ have been conditioned to open
only once a year. Who says it has to stop there? By VERONICA
FLORES.
</P>
<P>
   ROBISON-COLUMN (Austin, Texas) _ The controversy over Canadian
death row inmate Joseph Stanley Faulder blew into Austin like a

SPARQ TECHNOLOGY IS GOOD, BUT FIRM'S FAILURE PUTS IT IN DOUBT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Yesterday I bought a SyQuest SparQ drive for an excellent
price. I tried to log on to their home page, syquest.com several
times and I got timed out. I am told that the company closed its
doors. Do you know if this is correct? I do not want to get stuck
with a unit without any tech support available.
</P>
<P>
   A: SyQuest Technology's SparQ drives include some excellent
technology. For the price of an Iomega Zip drive, which uses
100-megabyte disks, you can have a drive that holds a full
gigabyte. The disks cost about twice as much as a Zip disk, but
hold 10 times as much.
</P>
<P>
   However, SyQuest was beset by managerial and quality problems.
The removable disk category is a cutthroat one, and right now
Iomega's Zip leads the pack. Of course, Zip and SparQ disks are not
compatible with each other.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the company cut its work force by half. In
November, SyQuest filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection,
suspended operations and said it has a buyer for its technology.
SyQuest is making provisions to provide support for its products as
part of the sale, according to a news release issued at the time.
However, at this writing, no buyer has been announced.
</P>
<P>
   SyQuest's action was so sudden that it took many of its users by
surprise. They're now scrambling to buy blank SparQ disks, which
reportedly are hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   SyQuest had even bought ads on taxi cabs during Fall Comdex in
November. The ads showed a SparQ drive in a red case and proclaimed
that the drives were ``red-hot.'' The juxtaposition of the ads
against the reality of what's happened to SyQuest drew more than a
few snickers from the Comdex crowd.
</P>
<P>
   If SyQuest indeed has a buyer that will continue its technology
and support users, you did get a great deal. But if not, you've got
the equivalent of a Beta videocassette player in a VHS world.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently bought a new computer. It has Windows 98 on it,
but it didn't come with a Windows 98 disk. Instead, there's
something called a ``System Restore'' disk that will put my
computer back to the state it was in when I first took it out of
the box. I bought some software that asks me to put my Windows 98
CD-ROM in the drive, but guess what? I don't have a Windows 98
CD-ROM! Should I call the company that made my computer and demand
one? Or, do I have to go out and buy it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Just on general principle, I think you should call the
company and ask for one _ but you may not need it. The Windows 98
setup files are probably on your computer.
</P>
<P>
   System-restore disks are a good idea, in theory. If you mess
something up on a PC, it can take you back to the starting point.
But you also lose everything you've put on your computer, including
potentially irreplaceable data files.
</P>
<P>
   Newer system-restore disks are smarter. They'll restore specific
components without affecting anything else.
</P>
<P>
   But there are still times when you really do need a Windows 98
disk. And the PC makers have a way around that problem.
</P>
<P>
   Look in your Windows folder, and you'll probably see another
folder called Options. Look in there, and you'll find one called
CABS. This holds the Windows 98 setup files _ just as though a copy
of the CD-ROM were placed on your hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   When a program says it wants the Windows 98 disk, point it to
the windowsoptions folder. It will find the CABS folder and draw
what it needs from there.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, if you have a copy of the Windows 98 disk and you
still have the windowsoptions folder on your PC, you can safely
delete it to save yourself some space.

AMERICA IS LETTING CLINTON'S FOES RUN THE SHOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The polls and the media are telling us that the public is not
interested in the congressional impeachment proceedings against
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   According to one poll, only 20 percent of those surveyed have
followed the historic impeachment hearings conducted by the House
Judiciary Committee ``very closely.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears that folks out here in the hinterlands have tuned out
the political crisis that fixates the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the polls consistently show that somewhere in the
neighborhood of 70 percent of Americans believe that the president
should not be impeached and removed from office _ which suggests
that the masses may not be interested in the impeachment debate but
that they have an opinion about it.
</P>
<P>
   Can the American people have an opinion _ a strong opinion, it
seems _ about something that they are consciously ignoring?
</P>
<P>
   Sure they can.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the anti-impeachment crowd's apparent apathy is
that they have forfeited the debate to the other side. And the
other side is anything but apathetic.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking about people who want Clinton's head on a platter.
They want him impeached, convicted, ousted from the White House and
then prosecuted in the criminal courts. In the view of
Clinton-haters who are driving the impeachment process, no
retribution against such a loathsome president could be too harsh.
</P>
<P>
   So. If you don't want the president to be impeached, you need to
tune in instead of tuning out. You need to let your representatives
in Congress know how you feel about all this because, lately, those
representatives haven't been hearing from anyone except
constituents who dream of running Clinton out of town on a rail.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure for impeaching the president, by the way _ for
those who've been napping for 11 months _ is for a majority of the
House of Representatives to approve articles of impeachment
charging the president with high crimes and/or misdemeanors, as
stipulated by the Constitution. The House then forwards the charges
to the Senate for a trial in which a two-thirds vote is needed for
conviction. Conviction on any article of impeachment would result
in the president's removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment is a political process that theoretically requires
public support. If they only hear from impeachment proponents,
House Republicans must assume that the public supports impeachment
_ an inevitable assumption if the 70 percent of the people who
claim to oppose impeachment are sitting on their couches watching
soap operas, game shows and sitcoms while the 30 percent who are
screaming for Clinton's scalp are putting their representatives'
feet to the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Even Republicans who are not inclined toward impeachment may
vote against Clinton because of pressure from anti-Clinton
constituents.
</P>
<P>
   All's fair in love and politics, of course, so citizens who
favor impeachment have every right on earth to lean on their
elected representatives.
</P>
<P>
   So do citizens who oppose impeachment _ but they're not
exercising that right. Which means that the majority that doesn't
want impeachment may be losing the argument to the minority that
does want it. We'll find out later this week, when the full House
votes on articles of impeachment recommended by the Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   If the people who oppose impeachment don't really care all that
much one way or the other, well, they deserve whatever happens.
Great thing about democracy: Activism usually trumps apathy.
</P>
<P>
   But if you are truly troubled by the idea that Congress may be
on the verge of overthrowing a duly elected president for offenses
that most Americans don't believe are impeachable, you might want
to take your cue from one of the anti-impeachment Democrats on the
Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wake up, America, they are about to impeach our president!''
declared Florida Rep. Robert Wexler as the committee undertook
formal debate of the proposed articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, pro or con, it's time to get off the couch and tune
in.

   Insects can help solve murders, but their testimony is being
attacked in the courts. Forensic entomologists say their science
offers the most reliable way of determining the time of death at a
crime scene, short of an eyewitness. Insects populate the human
corpse _ or any carcass _ in predictable waves over the course of
weeks. An entomologist must then knit together the arrival and
departure of several kinds of insects that visit the body in a more
or less orderly succession. Jessica Snyder Sachs, a former editor
of Science Digest who is based in the Atlanta area, reports.

   People can talk. Other animals can't. The birds and beasts can
use signals to attract, threaten or alert each other, but they
can't ask questions or strike bargains. Those skills make Homo
sapiens a uniquely successful, powerful and dangerous mammal.
Grooves and holes in fossil skulls may reveal when our ancestors
began to speak. The big question, though, is what drove them to it?

   Insects can help solve murders, but their testimony is being
attacked in the courts. Forensic entomologists say their science
offers the most reliable way of determining the time of death at a
crime scene, short of an eyewitness. Insects populate the human
corpse _ or any carcass _ in predictable waves over the course of
weeks. An entomologist must then knit together the arrival and
departure of several kinds of insects that visit the body in a more
or less orderly succession. Jessica Snyder Sachs, a former editor

   A recent study at the University of California at San Francisco
cultured 113 examples of cash. Most grew harmless organisms, but 18
percent of coins and 7 percent of notes had some less friendly
bacteria on them, including the odd colony of Escherichia coli and
the potential pathogen S. aureus. So Mom was right when she would

   If you want to see a time machine, go to room 2677 on the second
floor of the geology building at UCLA. Once you pass into the inner
sanctum, you are faced with a 5-foot-tall, 20-foot-wide piece of
equipment housed in stainless steel. This is the time machine. This
device, however, will not accept human passengers. What goes inside
is a flake of rock. By analyzing the atoms in the rock, this
machine can take you back to the time when the Himalayas arose, or
when life appeared on Earth. Kathy A. Svitil, an associate editor

   Insects can help solve murders, but their testimony is being
attacked in the courts. Forensic entomologists say their science
offers the most reliable way of determining the time of death at a
crime scene, short of an eyewitness. Insects populate the human
corpse _ or any carcass _ in predictable waves over the course of
weeks. An entomologist must then knit together the arrival and
departure of several kinds of insects that visit the body in a more
or less orderly succession. Jessica Snyder Sachs, a former editor
of Science Digest who is based in the Atlanta area, reports.

   A recent study at the University of California at San Francisco
cultured 113 examples of cash. Most grew harmless organisms, but 18
percent of coins and 7 percent of notes had some less friendly
bacteria on them, including the odd colony of Escherichia coli and
the potential pathogen S. aureus. So Mom was right when she would
yell, ``Don't put that in your mouth. You don't know where it's
been.'' Patricia Gadsby, a contributing editor of Discover

<P>
   In the cow town of Stroud, Okla., no one thinks twice about a
junk pile alongside a neighbor's driveway. But people paid
attention to the pile by Aureliano Cisneros's house, thanks to the
thick swarm of shiny, fat flies and a ripening stench.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 8, 1994, police discovered within that junk pile the
decaying, maggot-packed body of Cisneros himself. Apparently, after
being stabbed in the chest and neck, he had collapsed in front of
his house.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicion quickly fell on Cisneros's wife, Linda Howell. They'd
argued publicly the previous Thursday night, she acknowledged, but
they'd made up before morning. She hadn't seen her husband for two
days, since the evening of Saturday, Aug. 6, when he left home to
join some buddies.
</P>
<P>
   The police didn't buy her story and arrested her for the murder
of her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when Jackie Johnson, a deputy inspector at the Oklahoma
State Bureau of Investigation, looked over the forensic evidence,
she wasn't very confident about the case. Ironically, it was
Howell's defense attorney, Frank Muret, who led Johnson to the
evidence she needed.
</P>
<P>
   When she was handing over the forensic reports to Muret, he
asked if they had looked at the maggots on the corpse. If they had,
he was entitled to know what they'd found.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Muret walked out the door, Johnson picked up her
phone. Two calls later, she had located Neal Haskell, a forensic
entomologist _ a scientist trained in gleaning criminal information
from insects. He is, in fact, the world's only full-time forensic
entomologist.
</P>
<P>
   Haskell identified the larvae as belonging to two common flies:
the black blowfly and the secondary screwworm. He then determined
that these maggots were in their third developmental stage, or
instar.
</P>
<P>
   Since temperature influences the pace at which flies develop, he
consulted the temperature records from the nearest weather
stations, then calculated that the maggots had come from eggs laid
on the body 72 to 96 hours before discovery. Cisneros could have
died no later than the morning of Aug. 5 _ a day earlier than
Howell claimed she had last seen her husband alive.
</P>
<P>
   When faced with the scientific evidence, Howell's lawyer called
the calculations guesswork, and urged the judge to rule Haskell's
testimony inadmissible. The judge admitted the testimony. Soon
afterward Howell accepted a plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Disputes over the courtroom legitimacy of entomological evidence
are becoming more frequent and more pointed. Forensic entomologists
say it's worth the struggle, because their science offers the most
reliable way of determining the time of death at a crime scene,
short of an eyewitness.
</P>
<P>
   Insects populate the human corpse _ or any carcass _ in
predictable waves over the course of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The first to arrive are the husky bombardiers known as
blowflies. Once these flies depart, an entomologist must then knit
together the arrival and departure of several other kinds of
insects that visit the body in a more or less orderly succession.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Hawaii entomologist Lee Goff handled a particularly
grisly case in which the decomposed corpse of a Marine _ with an
execution-style bullet wound _ was found in a rain forest on Oahu.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Goff arrived, most of the blowflies had already come
and gone, but a host of other insects were still busy with the
corpse. Among them, Goff found soldier flies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They let the body age for about 20 days before coming in,'' he
says. ``And the ones I collected were fifth instars, between 9 and
11 days old.''
</P>
<P>
   Goff thus placed time of death at 29 to 31 days before the
body's discovery. Military police confronted two Marines seen with
the victim 30 days earlier, and they confessed.
</P>
<P>
   Part of what makes the method work so well for Goff is Hawaii's
isolation and its relatively limited number of insect species.
Experts on the mainland find it harder to make such definitive
analyses. They often encounter dozens of different cadaver-loving
insects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not unusual to find ourselves estimating the
developmental time of a lesser-known insect based on that of a
close relative that's been better studied,'' admits forensic
entomologist Robert Hall of the University of Missouri. ``On
cross-examination, a good lawyer will say, 'So, Dr. Hall, what
you're telling us is you're guessing.'''
</P>
<P>
   For forensic entomologists to answer such challenges requires
thousands of hours of research and legions of graduate students,
but these are hard to come by in their underfunded field.
</P>
<P>
   A noticeable exception has been a program set up by Gail
Anderson of Simon Fraser University, largely funded by the Canadian
Police Research Center. Anderson's students camp out across the
rugged landscape of British Columbia year-round, each baby-sitting
the carcasses of several dozen pigs.
</P>
<P>
   To simulate real-life homicides, some of the victims lie buried
in soil or partially submerged in streams or lakes. In 1995,
Anderson's students began clothing some of their pigs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Canada, at least, most of our murder victims are dressed,''
she explains. ``We needed to document whether this altered insect
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   The research raised eyebrows across North America when a school
newspaper intercepted a grad student's e-mail request for used
panties and bras. Wire services quickly spread the story: Wanted:
Pig Underwear.
</P>
<P>
   By studying pigs in underwear, the entomologists learned some
important things _ that clothing, for instance, helps conserve
moisture in a corpse, so that it will remain attractive to
blowflies longer than if it is naked, and that maggots tend to eat
the skin when a body is clothed but not if it is unclothed.
</P>
<P>
   As forensic entomologists struggle to make determining time of
death court-proof, recent work has begun to push the science's
powers in new directions.
</P>
<P>
   At the FBI's National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime
in Quantico, Va., entomologist Wayne Lord is perfecting a method
for tracing DNA found in bloodsucking insects to the humans on
which they have fed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only a matter of time before we put this research to work
in an actual case,'' Lord says. ``Most likely it will involve a
rape and murder, in which the suspect's blood is retrieved from
crab lice left on the victim.''
</P>
<P>
   Lord is still determining the feasibility of this approach, but
he is confident it will work. If he's right, then someday one more
previously mute witness will speak for the dead.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Saint Paul and your mother have always agreed about one thing:
Money is dirty. The peevish apostle worried about what lucre does
to the soul, while your mom worried about what money might do to
your body. Don't put it in your mouth, she'd say, you don't know
where it's been.
</P>
<P>
   You don't, but you can just imagine. Money is used for every
type of commerce, from buying milk at the corner store to
trafficking in sex and drugs. All this trade is rough on money.
</P>
<P>
   Even though paper bills (actually a rugged mix of 75 percent
cotton, 25 percent linen) are made to take abuse (4,000 folds in
each direction), the average U.S. dollar lasts a mere 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Moms the world over have done a fine job of convincing us money
is full of disgusting germs. Oddly, though, studies of bacteria on
money are few and far between.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972 a study in the Journal of the American Medical
Association cultured bacteria from 200 coins and bills and found
objectionable ones like fecal bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus on
13 percent of coins and 42 percent of notes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 a study published in Infections in Medicine found 3
percent of coins and 11 percent of bills growing bacteria, but only
benign ones, and decided ``our country seems to have cleaned up its
act.''
</P>
<P>
   Both studies used money collected in hospitals. Rigorous
scrubbing by doctors and nurses could leave their hands _ and money
_ exceptionally clean. Maybe differing hygienic practices account
for the studies' disparity.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, a study at the University of California at
San Francisco cultured 113 examples of ``real life'' cash. Most
grew harmless organisms, but 18 percent of coins and 7 percent of
notes had some less friendly bacteria on them, including the odd
colony of Escherichia coli and the potential pathogen S. aureus.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, these organisms usually spell trouble only if they
somehow breach the skin in large numbers. You're not likely to get
sick from the few bugs your hands encounter on a coin.
</P>
<P>
   What will be obvious by now is that anything that gets on hands
can get on money. And hands are hardly germ-free.
</P>
<P>
   In general, though, skin resists being colonized or invaded by
foreign bacteria. Its horny outer layer forms an efficient barrier,
its surface is too dry or too acidic for many nonresident species,
and its surface oils contain antimicrobials.
</P>
<P>
   In the mouth, saliva _ our natural mouthwash _ contains
germ-killing enzymes and the antibody immunoglobulin A. Any microbe
that makes it past the skin or the mouth's pink lining must contend
with the body's immune system. And any microbe that's swallowed
faces the acid test of the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   If money has a dirty little secret, it's not bugs but drugs. For
the past decade, there have been sporadic reports that U.S.
currency is hopelessly contaminated with cocaine. Is our money

   A study conducted at the Houston Advanced Research Center in
Texas and the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois examined
currency in Miami, Chicago and Houston and found an overall 70 to
80 percent contamination rate, with single dollar bills more
commonly contaminated than higher denominations.
</P>
<P>
   A recent look at money circulating in northern Illinois,
published this May in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, found even
higher rates: close to 93 percent of the sample, and 100 percent of
$20 bills, tested positive for cocaine. ``In fact, most Americans
handle small amounts of cocaine every day, not as packets sold by
drug dealers but on the dollar bills that line their pockets,''
concluded this study.
</P>
<P>
   How has moola become so amazingly infested with cocaine?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, the reason you traffic in drugs is to get money,'' comes
the deadpan reply from a spokesman for the Drug Enforcement
Administration who has worked undercover in narcotics and asked not
to be identified by name. ``When drugs come into the country,
traffickers are going to cut the dope with any number of chemicals.
Open the bags, mix in the cut, repackage in smaller bags, sell to
people who sell on the streets. All the time money's changing
hands. It's hard to keep money and drugs apart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But that can't be the whole story,'' adds Tom Jourdan, chief
of the materials and devices unit at the Federal Bureau of
Investigation Laboratory in Washington. The going theory, held by
Jourdan and others, is that one bill brushed through a counting
machine in a bank could contaminate a whole stack.
</P>
<P>
   Something in paper money seems to be binding to cocaine almost
like a biological receptor, and Jourdan thinks that something is
ink: ``I've wiped an old bill on white paper, and ink comes off.
The green pigment never really dries, and drugs of abuse get stuck
to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cocaine dissolves in almost anything _ water, alcohol, fat. And
it sticks quite nicely to skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does that mean your grandmother in the Midwest is going to be
contaminated by a bill handled by a drug dealer in Chicago?'' asks
David Kidwell, a chemist at the Naval Research Laboratory in
Washington. ``Not very likely. If money's freshly dusted with
cocaine, it will get on you, of course. But once money's been
handled and passed through machines, it's too deeply embedded.''
</P>
<P>
   Simulation studies at Argonne and a ``real life'' test at
Creighton University in Omaha, Nebraska, apparently bear him out.
For the Creighton study, bank tellers were swabbed after a
four-hour shift handling cash. Although cocaine was found on the
cash (even in rural Nebraska), none was transferred to the tellers'
hands.
</P>
<P>
   So money isn't exactly squeaky clean. But it isn't exactly going
to do us in, either. If there's a lesson here, it's that money
reflects whatever activity, and mischief, human hands get up to _
and the activity and occasional mischief of all the microscopic
organisms along for the ride on our skin.

<P>
   Saint Paul and your mother have always agreed about one thing:
Money is dirty. The peevish apostle worried about what lucre does
to the soul, while your mom worried about what money might do to
your body. Don't put it in your mouth, she'd say, you don't know
where it's been.
</P>
<P>
   You don't, but you can just imagine. Money is used for every
type of commerce, from buying milk at the corner store to
trafficking in sex and drugs. All this trade is rough on money.
</P>
<P>
   Even though paper bills (actually a rugged mix of 75 percent
cotton, 25 percent linen) are made to take abuse (4,000 folds in
each direction), the average U.S. dollar lasts a mere 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Moms the world over have done a fine job of convincing us money
is full of disgusting germs. Oddly, though, studies of bacteria on
money are few and far between.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972 a study in the Journal of the American Medical
Association cultured bacteria from 200 coins and bills and found
objectionable ones like fecal bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus on
13 percent of coins and 42 percent of notes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 a study published in Infections in Medicine found 3
percent of coins and 11 percent of bills growing bacteria, but only
benign ones, and decided ``our country seems to have cleaned up its
act.''
</P>
<P>
   Both studies used money collected in hospitals. Rigorous
scrubbing by doctors and nurses could leave their hands _ and money
_ exceptionally clean. Maybe differing hygienic practices account
for the studies' disparity.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, a study at the University of California at
San Francisco cultured 113 examples of ``real life'' cash. Most
grew harmless organisms, but 18 percent of coins and 7 percent of
notes had some less friendly bacteria on them, including the odd
colony of Escherichia coli and the potential pathogen S. aureus.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, these organisms usually spell trouble only if they
somehow breach the skin in large numbers. You're not likely to get
sick from the few bugs your hands encounter on a coin.
</P>
<P>
   What will be obvious by now is that anything that gets on hands
can get on money. And hands are hardly germ-free.
</P>
<P>
   In general, though, skin resists being colonized or invaded by
foreign bacteria. Its horny outer layer forms an efficient barrier,
its surface is too dry or too acidic for many nonresident species,
and its surface oils contain antimicrobials.
</P>
<P>
   In the mouth, saliva _ our natural mouthwash _ contains
germ-killing enzymes and the antibody immunoglobulin A. Any microbe
that makes it past the skin or the mouth's pink lining must contend
with the body's immune system. And any microbe that's swallowed
faces the acid test of the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   If money has a dirty little secret, it's not bugs but drugs. For
the past decade, there have been sporadic reports that U.S.
currency is hopelessly contaminated with cocaine. Is our money
snowed under?
</P>
<P>
   A study conducted at the Houston Advanced Research Center in
Texas and the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois examined
currency in Miami, Chicago and Houston and found an overall 70 to
80 percent contamination rate, with single dollar bills more
commonly contaminated than higher denominations.

<P>
   If you want to see a time machine, go to room 2677 on the second
floor of the geology building at UCLA. Once you pass into the inner
sanctum, you are faced with a 5-foot-tall, 20-foot-wide piece of
equipment housed in stainless steel. This is the time machine.
</P>
<P>
   This device, however, will not accept human passengers. What
goes inside is a flake of rock. By analyzing the atoms in the rock,
this machine can take you back to the time when the Himalayas
arose, or when life appeared on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The official name of this place is the National Science
Foundation/Keck Foundation National Ion Microprobe Facility. The
name of the machine is the Cameca 1270.
</P>
<P>
   There are other ion microprobes, but the one at UCLA is by far
the best. They all work by sorting and counting isotopes.
</P>
<P>
   If you remember basic chemistry, you'll recall that isotopes are
the various forms an element can take. Once created, many isotopes
are stable.
</P>
<P>
   Carbon 12 and carbon 13, for example, can be found in our solar
system in the same ratio that they were in when the solar system
formed some 4.5 billion years ago. Living things prefer carbon 12
to carbon 13, so the minerals and fossils that have contained life
always have more, relative to nonliving things, of the lighter
isotope.
</P>
<P>
   Not all isotopes are stable, though. Some will release particles
and metamorphose into entirely different elements, and they do so
at a predictable rate. Some break down after just fractions of a
second; others in quadrillions of years. Isotopes can thus act as
clocks, each working on its own timescale.
</P>
<P>
   But decoding the history written in isotopes is not simple,
because it is sometimes inscribed on mineral crystals only a few
thousandths of an inch across, buried inside younger rock. To
detect them, you need an ion microprobe _ ideally, UCLA's ion
microprobe.
</P>
<P>
   The UCLA machine is the brainchild of isotopic chemist Mark
Harrison. It analyzes isotopes by liberating them from the rock
that holds them captive.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers embed the target flake in a one-inch block of resin
and fire a beam of charged atoms, or ions, at the block. When the
beam strikes the sample, some of its momentum is transferred to the
atoms on the surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them will have enough energy imparted to them that
they'll ionize,'' Harrison says.
</P>
<P>
   These new ions form a cloud, which the microprobe can corral in
a 10,000-volt electric field. The ions can then be sorted by their
charge and by their mass as they pass through a giant magnet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heavier ions take a wider path through the magnet because the
magnet is unable to deflect them as much,'' Harrison says.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the ions crash into a detector at the end of the
machine in an orderly ranking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we can just count them,'' Harrison says.
</P>
<P>
   With its four-ton magnet, the Cameca 1270 can distinguish
between molecules that differ in mass by just one part in 8,000,
and analyze specks of mineral less than four-millionths of an inch
across. That sort of precision has led to some exciting
discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   For example, geologist Stephen Mojzsis and his Scripps
Institution of Oceanography colleague Gustaf Arrhenius used the
microprobe to look at the ratio of carbon 13 to carbon 12 in
3.85-billion-year-old sedimentary rocks from an island on the
southwest coast of Greenland.
</P>
<P>
   (The oldest previously known sign of life was
3.45-billion-year-old fossils of microbes.)
</P>
<P>
   If Earth had been lifeless 3.85 billion years ago, the crystals
in the rock should have had the same ratio found throughout the
lifeless solar system. But the proportion was actually off by a few
percent _ ``Far and away above anything that is inorganic,''
Mojzsis says.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, scientists have begun to wonder if life also left its
mark on Mars. In 1996, NASA scientists announced that they had
found microscopic fossils and other signs of biological activity in
a Martian meteorite that had landed in Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Leshin, a cosmochemist at UCLA, decided to use the
microprobe to analyze the tiny globules of carbonate inside the
meteorite where these supposed signs of life were. The type of
oxygen isotope that a carbonate incorporates into its structure
depends greatly on temperature.
</P>
<P>
   A carbonate that forms at a relatively cool temperature will be
enriched in oxygen 18 compared with carbonates that form at warmer
temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   In NASA's meteorite, Leshin found that the ratio of oxygen 18 to
oxygen 16 varied wildly between different carbonate globules.
Several scenarios could explain the ratios _ none of them very
friendly to life.
</P>
<P>
   Leshin's results now stand as a major question mark to the claim
for life on Mars.
</P>
<P>
   The Cameca 1270's sharp focus recently allowed Harrison to put a
new date on the birth of the Himalayas. Scientists had long
believed that the mountain range was built some 19 to 25 million
years ago. Harrison got hold of garnets that had formed in the
intense pressures of the primary fault in the Himalayas. Inside the
garnets were tiny crystals rich in the element thorium, which
decays into lead 208 with clocklike regularity.
</P>
<P>
   Using the ion microprobe, Harrison was able to measure the
thorium and lead in the crystals and was surprised to discover that
they were only 4 to 8 million years old. The Himalayas actually
arose over 10 million years more recently than anyone had thought.
</P>
<P>
   As researchers continue to explore the Cameca 1270's powers,
Harrison believes that the only limit they will encounter won't be
the machine's technical capabilities but the inherent limits in the
isotopes themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get to smaller and smaller domains _ to see
behavior, to see gradients, to see signals that we haven't had
access to before. But because we are looking at such small domains,
with relatively few atoms, we are beginning to run into the
statistical limits of our chronometers,'' Harrison says. ``It's not
a problem now, but in a few years we'll have to deal with it.''

   People can talk. Other animals can't. The birds and beasts can
use signals to attract, threaten or alert each other, but they
can't ask questions, strike bargains, tell stories or lay out a
plan of action. Those skills make Homo sapiens a uniquely
successful, powerful and dangerous mammal.
</P>
<P>
   Other creatures' signals carry only a few limited kinds of
information about what's happening at the moment, but language lets
us tell each other in limitless detail about what used to be or
will be or might be.
</P>
<P>
   Without language, we would be only a sort of upright chimpanzee
with funny feet and clever hands. With it, we are the
self-possessed masters of the planet.
</P>
<P>
   We can reasonably assume that by at least 30,000 years ago
people were talking _ at any rate, they were producing tokens of
art and religion, high-level forms of symbolic behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Language surely goes back further than that, but archaeologists
don't agree on just how far. Paleontologists have pored over the
fossil bones of our ancient relatives in search of evidence for
speech abilities.
</P>
<P>
   All mammals produce their vocal noises by contracting muscles
that compress the rib cage. The air in the lungs is driven out
through the windpipe to the larynx, where it flows between the
vocal cords. These structures vibrate in the breeze, producing a
buzzing sound that becomes the voice.
</P>
<P>
   In people, the larynx lies well below the back of the tongue,
and most of the air goes out through the mouth when we talk. But in
most mammals, including apes, the larynx sticks farther up behind
the tongue, into the back of the nose, and most of the exhaled air
passes out through the nostrils. Nonhuman mammals make mostly nasal
sounds as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Lieberman of Brown University thinks that an apelike
throat persisted for some time in our hominid ancestors. His
studies of fossil jaws and skulls persuade him that a more modern
throat didn't evolve until some 500,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This year my colleague Richard Kay, his student Michelle Balow
and I were able to offer support for Lieberman's ideas from another
part of the hominid body.
</P>
<P>
   The tongue's movements are controlled almost solely by a nerve
called the hypoglossal. In its course from the brain to the tongue,
this nerve passes through a hole in the skull. Kay, Balow and I
found that this bony canal is relatively big in modern humans _
about twice as big in cross section as that of a like-size
chimpanzee.
</P>
<P>
   Our larger canal presumably reflects a bigger hypoglossal nerve,
giving us the precise control over tongue movements that we need
for speech.
</P>
<P>
   We also measured this hole in the skulls of a number of fossil
hominids. Australopithecines have small canals like those of apes,
suggesting that they couldn't talk. But later skulls from the genus
Homo, beginning with a 400,000-year-old skull from Zambia, all have
big, humanlike hypoglossal canals. These are also the skulls that
were the first to house brains as big as our own.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years ago most linguists thought that people learn to talk
through the same sort of behavior reinforcement used in training an
animal to do tricks: When children use a word correctly or produce
a grammatical sentence, they are rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   This picture was swept away in the late 1950s by the
revolutionary ideas of Noam Chomsky. Chomsky argued that we are all
born with the same fundamental grammar hard-wired into our brains,
and we are preprogrammed to pick up the additional rules of the
local language, just as baby ducks are hard-wired to follow the
first big animal they see when they hatch.
</P>
<P>
   If language learning were just a matter of proper training,
Chomsky reasoned, we ought to be able to teach English to lab rats,
or at least to apes.
</P>
<P>
   As we have seen, apes aren't built to talk. But they can be
trained to use sign language or to point to word-symbols on a
keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   Duane Rumbaugh and Sue Savage-Rumbaugh work at the Yerkes
Regional Primate Research Center in Atlanta, where Sue made a
surprising breakthrough with a young bonobo named Kanzi.
</P>
<P>
   Kanzi had watched his mother try to learn signs with little
success. When Sue started with Kanzi, she was astonished to
discover that he already knew the meaning of 12 of the keyboard
symbols. Apparently, he had learned them without any training or
rewards.
</P>
<P>
   In the years that followed, he learned new symbols quickly and
used them both to answer questions and to ``talk'' about things
that he intended to do or had already done. Still more amazingly,
he had a considerable understanding of spoken English _ including
its syntax.
</P>
<P>
   In their forthcoming book, ``Lingua ex Machina,'' neuroscientist
William Calvin of the University of Washington and linguist Derek
Bickerton of the University of Hawaii argue that the ability to
create symbols _ signs that refer to things _ is potentially
present in any animal that can learn to interpret natural signs,
such as a trail of footprints. Syntax, meanwhile, emerges from the
abstract thought required for a social life.
</P>
<P>
   In apes and some other mammals with complex and subtle social
relationships, individuals make alliances and act altruistically
toward others, with the implicit understanding that their favors
will be returned. These foreshadowings of symbols and syntax, they
propose, laid the groundwork for language in a lot of social
animals but didn't create language itself. That had to wait until
our ancestors evolved brains big enough to handle the large-scale
operations needed to generate and process complex strings of signs.
</P>
<P>
   Calvin and Bickerton suggest that brain enlargement in our
ancestry was the result of evolutionary pressures that favored
intelligence and motor coordination for making tools and throwing
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   As a side effect of these selection pressures, human evolution
crossed a threshold at which language became possible.
</P>
<P>
   This account may be wrong in some of its details, but the story
in its broad outlines solves so many puzzles and ties up so many
loose ends that something like it must surely be correct. It also
promises to resolve our conflicting views of the boundary between
people and animals.
</P>
<P>
   The story of language origins sketched above suggests that the
human difference is real and profound, but it is rooted in aspects
of psychology and biology that we share with our close animal
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   If the growing consensus on the origins of language can join
these disparate truths together, it will be a big step forward in
the study of human evolution.

 c.1998 Discover magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   In the cow town of Stroud, Okla., no one thinks twice about a
junk pile alongside a neighbor's driveway. But people paid
attention to the pile by Aureliano Cisneros's house, thanks to the
thick swarm of shiny, fat flies and a ripening stench.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 8, 1994, police discovered within that junk pile the
decaying, maggot-packed body of Cisneros himself. Apparently, after
being stabbed in the chest and neck, he had collapsed in front of
his house.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicion quickly fell on Cisneros's wife, Linda Howell. They'd
argued publicly the previous Thursday night, she acknowledged, but
they'd made up before morning. She hadn't seen her husband for two
days, since the evening of Saturday, Aug. 6, when he left home to
join some buddies.
</P>
<P>
   The police didn't buy her story and arrested her for the murder
of her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when Jackie Johnson, a deputy inspector at the Oklahoma
State Bureau of Investigation, looked over the forensic evidence,
she wasn't very confident about the case. Ironically, it was
Howell's defense attorney, Frank Muret, who led Johnson to the
evidence she needed.
</P>
<P>
   When she was handing over the forensic reports to Muret, he
asked if they had looked at the maggots on the corpse. If they had,
he was entitled to know what they'd found.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Muret walked out the door, Johnson picked up her
phone. Two calls later, she had located Neal Haskell, a forensic
entomologist _ a scientist trained in gleaning criminal information
from insects. He is, in fact, the world's only full-time forensic
entomologist.
</P>
<P>
   Haskell identified the larvae as belonging to two common flies:
the black blowfly and the secondary screwworm. He then determined
that these maggots were in their third developmental stage, or
instar.
</P>
<P>
   Since temperature influences the pace at which flies develop, he
consulted the temperature records from the nearest weather
stations, then calculated that the maggots had come from eggs laid
on the body 72 to 96 hours before discovery. Cisneros could have
died no later than the morning of Aug. 5 _ a day earlier than
Howell claimed she had last seen her husband alive.
</P>
<P>
   When faced with the scientific evidence, Howell's lawyer called
the calculations guesswork, and urged the judge to rule Haskell's
testimony inadmissible. The judge admitted the testimony. Soon
afterward Howell accepted a plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Disputes over the courtroom legitimacy of entomological evidence
are becoming more frequent and more pointed. Forensic entomologists
say it's worth the struggle, because their science offers the most
reliable way of determining the time of death at a crime scene,
short of an eyewitness.
</P>
<P>
   Insects populate the human corpse _ or any carcass _ in
predictable waves over the course of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The first to arrive are the husky bombardiers known as
blowflies. Once these flies depart, an entomologist must then knit
together the arrival and departure of several other kinds of
insects that visit the body in a more or less orderly succession.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Hawaii entomologist Lee Goff handled a particularly
grisly case in which the decomposed corpse of a Marine _ with an
execution-style bullet wound _ was found in a rain forest on Oahu.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Goff arrived, most of the blowflies had already come
and gone, but a host of other insects were still busy with the
corpse. Among them, Goff found soldier flies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They let the body age for about 20 days before coming in,'' he
says. ``And the ones I collected were fifth instars, between 9 and
11 days old.''
</P>
<P>
   Goff thus placed time of death at 29 to 31 days before the
body's discovery. Military police confronted two Marines seen with
the victim 30 days earlier, and they confessed.
</P>
<P>
   Part of what makes the method work so well for Goff is Hawaii's
isolation and its relatively limited number of insect species.
Experts on the mainland find it harder to make such definitive
analyses. They often encounter dozens of different cadaver-loving
insects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not unusual to find ourselves estimating the
developmental time of a lesser-known insect based on that of a
close relative that's been better studied,'' admits forensic
entomologist Robert Hall of the University of Missouri. ``On
cross-examination, a good lawyer will say, 'So, Dr. Hall, what
you're telling us is you're guessing.'''
</P>
<P>
   For forensic entomologists to answer such challenges requires
thousands of hours of research and legions of graduate students,
but these are hard to come by in their underfunded field.
</P>
<P>
   A noticeable exception has been a program set up by Gail
Anderson of Simon Fraser University, largely funded by the Canadian
Police Research Center. Anderson's students camp out across the
rugged landscape of British Columbia year-round, each baby-sitting
the carcasses of several dozen pigs.
</P>
<P>
   To simulate real-life homicides, some of the victims lie buried
in soil or partially submerged in streams or lakes. In 1995,
Anderson's students began clothing some of their pigs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Canada, at least, most of our murder victims are dressed,''
she explains. ``We needed to document whether this altered insect
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   The research raised eyebrows across North America when a school
newspaper intercepted a grad student's e-mail request for used
panties and bras. Wire services quickly spread the story: Wanted:
Pig Underwear.
</P>
<P>
   By studying pigs in underwear, the entomologists learned some
important things _ that clothing, for instance, helps conserve
moisture in a corpse, so that it will remain attractive to
blowflies longer than if it is naked, and that maggots tend to eat
the skin when a body is clothed but not if it is unclothed.
</P>
<P>
   As forensic entomologists struggle to make determining time of
death court-proof, recent work has begun to push the science's
powers in new directions.
</P>
<P>
   At the FBI's National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime
in Quantico, Va., entomologist Wayne Lord is perfecting a method
for tracing DNA found in bloodsucking insects to the humans on
which they have fed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only a matter of time before we put this research to work
in an actual case,'' Lord says. ``Most likely it will involve a
rape and murder, in which the suspect's blood is retrieved from
crab lice left on the victim.''
</P>
<P>
   Lord is still determining the feasibility of this approach, but
he is confident it will work. If he's right, then someday one more
previously mute witness will speak for the dead.

<P>
   In the cow town of Stroud, Okla., no one thinks twice about a
junk pile alongside a neighbor's driveway. But people paid
attention to the pile by Aureliano Cisneros's house, thanks to the
thick swarm of shiny, fat flies and a ripening stench.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 8, 1994, police discovered within that junk pile the
decaying, maggot-packed body of Cisneros himself. Apparently, after
being stabbed in the chest and neck, he had collapsed in front of
his house.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicion quickly fell on Cisneros's wife, Linda Howell. They'd
argued publicly the previous Thursday night, she acknowledged, but
they'd made up before morning. She hadn't seen her husband for two
days, since the evening of Saturday, Aug. 6, when he left home to
join some buddies.
</P>
<P>
   The police didn't buy her story and arrested her for the murder
of her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when Jackie Johnson, a deputy inspector at the Oklahoma
State Bureau of Investigation, looked over the forensic evidence,
she wasn't very confident about the case. Ironically, it was
Howell's defense attorney, Frank Muret, who led Johnson to the
evidence she needed.
</P>
<P>
   When she was handing over the forensic reports to Muret, he
asked if they had looked at the maggots on the corpse. If they had,
he was entitled to know what they'd found.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Muret walked out the door, Johnson picked up her
phone. Two calls later, she had located Neal Haskell, a forensic
entomologist _ a scientist trained in gleaning criminal information
from insects. He is, in fact, the world's only full-time forensic
entomologist.
</P>
<P>
   Haskell identified the larvae as belonging to two common flies:
the black blowfly and the secondary screwworm. He then determined
that these maggots were in their third developmental stage, or
instar.
</P>
<P>
   Since temperature influences the pace at which flies develop, he
consulted the temperature records from the nearest weather
stations, then calculated that the maggots had come from eggs laid
on the body 72 to 96 hours before discovery. Cisneros could have
died no later than the morning of Aug. 5 _ a day earlier than
Howell claimed she had last seen her husband alive.
</P>
<P>
   When faced with the scientific evidence, Howell's lawyer called
the calculations guesswork, and urged the judge to rule Haskell's
testimony inadmissible. The judge admitted the testimony. Soon
afterward Howell accepted a plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Disputes over the courtroom legitimacy of entomological evidence
are becoming more frequent and more pointed. Forensic entomologists
say it's worth the struggle, because their science offers the most
reliable way of determining the time of death at a crime scene,
short of an eyewitness.
</P>
<P>
   Insects populate the human corpse _ or any carcass _ in
predictable waves over the course of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The first to arrive are the husky bombardiers known as
blowflies. Once these flies depart, an entomologist must then knit
together the arrival and departure of several other kinds of
insects that visit the body in a more or less orderly succession.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Hawaii entomologist Lee Goff handled a particularly
grisly case in which the decomposed corpse of a Marine _ with an
execution-style bullet wound _ was found in a rain forest on Oahu.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Goff arrived, most of the blowflies had already come
and gone, but a host of other insects were still busy with the
corpse. Among them, Goff found soldier flies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They let the body age for about 20 days before coming in,'' he
says. ``And the ones I collected were fifth instars, between 9 and
11 days old.''
</P>
<P>
   Goff thus placed time of death at 29 to 31 days before the
body's discovery. Military police confronted two Marines seen with
the victim 30 days earlier, and they confessed.
</P>
<P>
   Part of what makes the method work so well for Goff is Hawaii's
isolation and its relatively limited number of insect species.
Experts on the mainland find it harder to make such definitive
analyses. They often encounter dozens of different cadaver-loving
insects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not unusual to find ourselves estimating the
developmental time of a lesser-known insect based on that of a
close relative that's been better studied,'' admits forensic
entomologist Robert Hall of the University of Missouri. ``On
cross-examination, a good lawyer will say, 'So, Dr. Hall, what
you're telling us is you're guessing.'''
</P>
<P>
   For forensic entomologists to answer such challenges requires
thousands of hours of research and legions of graduate students,
but these are hard to come by in their underfunded field.
</P>
<P>
   A noticeable exception has been a program set up by Gail
Anderson of Simon Fraser University, largely funded by the Canadian
Police Research Center. Anderson's students camp out across the
rugged landscape of British Columbia year-round, each baby-sitting
the carcasses of several dozen pigs.
</P>
<P>
   To simulate real-life homicides, some of the victims lie buried
in soil or partially submerged in streams or lakes. In 1995,
Anderson's students began clothing some of their pigs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Canada, at least, most of our murder victims are dressed,''
she explains. ``We needed to document whether this altered insect
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   The research raised eyebrows across North America when a school
newspaper intercepted a grad student's e-mail request for used
panties and bras. Wire services quickly spread the story: Wanted:
Pig Underwear.
</P>
<P>
   By studying pigs in underwear, the entomologists learned some
important things _ that clothing, for instance, helps conserve
moisture in a corpse, so that it will remain attractive to
blowflies longer than if it is naked, and that maggots tend to eat
the skin when a body is clothed but not if it is unclothed.
</P>
<P>
   As forensic entomologists struggle to make determining time of
death court-proof, recent work has begun to push the science's
powers in new directions.
</P>
<P>
   At the FBI's National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime
in Quantico, Va., entomologist Wayne Lord is perfecting a method
for tracing DNA found in bloodsucking insects to the humans on
which they have fed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only a matter of time before we put this research to work
in an actual case,'' Lord says. ``Most likely it will involve a
rape and murder, in which the suspect's blood is retrieved from
crab lice left on the victim.''
</P>
<P>
   Lord is still determining the feasibility of this approach, but
he is confident it will work. If he's right, then someday one more
previously mute witness will speak for the dead.

<P>
   Saint Paul and your mother have always agreed about one thing:
Money is dirty. The peevish apostle worried about what lucre does
to the soul, while your mom worried about what money might do to
your body. Don't put it in your mouth, she'd say, you don't know
where it's been.
</P>
<P>
   You don't, but you can just imagine. Money is used for every
type of commerce, from buying milk at the corner store to
trafficking in sex and drugs. All this trade is rough on money.
</P>
<P>
   Even though paper bills (actually a rugged mix of 75 percent
cotton, 25 percent linen) are made to take abuse (4,000 folds in
each direction), the average U.S. dollar lasts a mere 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Moms the world over have done a fine job of convincing us money
is full of disgusting germs. Oddly, though, studies of bacteria on
money are few and far between.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972 a study in the Journal of the American Medical
Association cultured bacteria from 200 coins and bills and found
objectionable ones like fecal bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus on
13 percent of coins and 42 percent of notes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 a study published in Infections in Medicine found 3
percent of coins and 11 percent of bills growing bacteria, but only
benign ones, and decided ``our country seems to have cleaned up its
act.''
</P>
<P>
   Both studies used money collected in hospitals. Rigorous
scrubbing by doctors and nurses could leave their hands _ and money
_ exceptionally clean. Maybe differing hygienic practices account
for the studies' disparity.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, a study at the University of California at
San Francisco cultured 113 examples of ``real life'' cash. Most
grew harmless organisms, but 18 percent of coins and 7 percent of
notes had some less friendly bacteria on them, including the odd
colony of Escherichia coli and the potential pathogen S. aureus.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, these organisms usually spell trouble only if they
somehow breach the skin in large numbers. You're not likely to get
sick from the few bugs your hands encounter on a coin.
</P>
<P>
   What will be obvious by now is that anything that gets on hands
can get on money. And hands are hardly germ-free.
</P>
<P>
   In general, though, skin resists being colonized or invaded by
foreign bacteria. Its horny outer layer forms an efficient barrier,
its surface is too dry or too acidic for many nonresident species,
and its surface oils contain antimicrobials.
</P>
<P>
   In the mouth, saliva _ our natural mouthwash _ contains
germ-killing enzymes and the antibody immunoglobulin A. Any microbe
that makes it past the skin or the mouth's pink lining must contend
with the body's immune system. And any microbe that's swallowed
faces the acid test of the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   If money has a dirty little secret, it's not bugs but drugs. For
the past decade, there have been sporadic reports that U.S.
currency is hopelessly contaminated with cocaine. Is our money
snowed under?
</P>
<P>
   A study conducted at the Houston Advanced Research Center in
Texas and the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois examined
currency in Miami, Chicago and Houston and found an overall 70 to
80 percent contamination rate, with single dollar bills more
commonly contaminated than higher denominations.
</P>
<P>
   A recent look at money circulating in northern Illinois,
published this May in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, found even
higher rates: close to 93 percent of the sample, and 100 percent of
$20 bills, tested positive for cocaine. ``In fact, most Americans
handle small amounts of cocaine every day, not as packets sold by
drug dealers but on the dollar bills that line their pockets,''
concluded this study.
</P>
<P>
   How has moola become so amazingly infested with cocaine?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, the reason you traffic in drugs is to get money,'' comes
the deadpan reply from a spokesman for the Drug Enforcement
Administration who has worked undercover in narcotics and asked not
to be identified by name. ``When drugs come into the country,
traffickers are going to cut the dope with any number of chemicals.
Open the bags, mix in the cut, repackage in smaller bags, sell to
people who sell on the streets. All the time money's changing
hands. It's hard to keep money and drugs apart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But that can't be the whole story,'' adds Tom Jourdan, chief
of the materials and devices unit at the Federal Bureau of
Investigation Laboratory in Washington. The going theory, held by
Jourdan and others, is that one bill brushed through a counting
machine in a bank could contaminate a whole stack.
</P>
<P>
   Something in paper money seems to be binding to cocaine almost
like a biological receptor, and Jourdan thinks that something is
ink: ``I've wiped an old bill on white paper, and ink comes off.
The green pigment never really dries, and drugs of abuse get stuck
to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cocaine dissolves in almost anything _ water, alcohol, fat. And
it sticks quite nicely to skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does that mean your grandmother in the Midwest is going to be
contaminated by a bill handled by a drug dealer in Chicago?'' asks
David Kidwell, a chemist at the Naval Research Laboratory in
Washington. ``Not very likely. If money's freshly dusted with
cocaine, it will get on you, of course. But once money's been
handled and passed through machines, it's too deeply embedded.''
</P>
<P>
   Simulation studies at Argonne and a ``real life'' test at
Creighton University in Omaha, Nebraska, apparently bear him out.
For the Creighton study, bank tellers were swabbed after a
four-hour shift handling cash. Although cocaine was found on the
cash (even in rural Nebraska), none was transferred to the tellers'
hands.
</P>
<P>
   So money isn't exactly squeaky clean. But it isn't exactly going
to do us in, either. If there's a lesson here, it's that money
reflects whatever activity, and mischief, human hands get up to _
and the activity and occasional mischief of all the microscopic
organisms along for the ride on our skin.

 By KATHY A. SVITIL  
 c.1998 Discover magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   If you want to see a time machine, go to room 2677 on the second
floor of the geology building at UCLA. Once you pass into the inner
sanctum, you are faced with a 5-foot-tall, 20-foot-wide piece of
equipment housed in stainless steel. This is the time machine.
</P>
<P>
   This device, however, will not accept human passengers. What
goes inside is a flake of rock. By analyzing the atoms in the rock,
this machine can take you back to the time when the Himalayas
arose, or when life appeared on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The official name of this place is the National Science
Foundation/Keck Foundation National Ion Microprobe Facility. The
name of the machine is the Cameca 1270.
</P>
<P>
   There are other ion microprobes, but the one at UCLA is by far
the best. They all work by sorting and counting isotopes.
</P>
<P>
   If you remember basic chemistry, you'll recall that isotopes are
the various forms an element can take. Once created, many isotopes
are stable.
</P>
<P>
   Carbon 12 and carbon 13, for example, can be found in our solar
system in the same ratio that they were in when the solar system
formed some 4.5 billion years ago. Living things prefer carbon 12
to carbon 13, so the minerals and fossils that have contained life
always have more, relative to nonliving things, of the lighter
isotope.
</P>
<P>
   Not all isotopes are stable, though. Some will release particles
and metamorphose into entirely different elements, and they do so
at a predictable rate. Some break down after just fractions of a
second; others in quadrillions of years. Isotopes can thus act as
clocks, each working on its own timescale.
</P>
<P>
   But decoding the history written in isotopes is not simple,
because it is sometimes inscribed on mineral crystals only a few
thousandths of an inch across, buried inside younger rock. To
detect them, you need an ion microprobe _ ideally, UCLA's ion
microprobe.
</P>
<P>
   The UCLA machine is the brainchild of isotopic chemist Mark
Harrison. It analyzes isotopes by liberating them from the rock
that holds them captive.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers embed the target flake in a one-inch block of resin
and fire a beam of charged atoms, or ions, at the block. When the
beam strikes the sample, some of its momentum is transferred to the
atoms on the surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them will have enough energy imparted to them that
they'll ionize,'' Harrison says.
</P>
<P>
   These new ions form a cloud, which the microprobe can corral in
a 10,000-volt electric field. The ions can then be sorted by their
charge and by their mass as they pass through a giant magnet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heavier ions take a wider path through the magnet because the
magnet is unable to deflect them as much,'' Harrison says.

   With its four-ton magnet, the Cameca 1270 can distinguish
between molecules that differ in mass by just one part in 8,000,
and analyze specks of mineral less than four-millionths of an inch

discoveries.

   For example, geologist Stephen Mojzsis and his Scripps
Institution of Oceanography colleague Gustaf Arrhenius used the
microprobe to look at the ratio of carbon 13 to carbon 12 in
3.85-billion-year-old sedimentary rocks from an island on the
southwest coast of Greenland.

<P>
   (The oldest previously known sign of life was
3.45-billion-year-old fossils of microbes.)
</P>
<P>
   If Earth had been lifeless 3.85 billion years ago, the crystals
in the rock should have had the same ratio found throughout the
lifeless solar system. But the proportion was actually off by a few
percent _ ``Far and away above anything that is inorganic,''
Mojzsis says.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, scientists have begun to wonder if life also left its
mark on Mars. In 1996, NASA scientists announced that they had
found microscopic fossils and other signs of biological activity in
a Martian meteorite that had landed in Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Leshin, a cosmochemist at UCLA, decided to use the
microprobe to analyze the tiny globules of carbonate inside the
meteorite where these supposed signs of life were. The type of
oxygen isotope that a carbonate incorporates into its structure
depends greatly on temperature.
</P>
<P>
   A carbonate that forms at a relatively cool temperature will be
enriched in oxygen 18 compared with carbonates that form at warmer
temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   In NASA's meteorite, Leshin found that the ratio of oxygen 18 to
oxygen 16 varied wildly between different carbonate globules.
Several scenarios could explain the ratios _ none of them very
friendly to life.
</P>
<P>
   Leshin's results now stand as a major question mark to the claim
for life on Mars.
</P>
<P>
   The Cameca 1270's sharp focus recently allowed Harrison to put a
new date on the birth of the Himalayas. Scientists had long
believed that the mountain range was built some 19 to 25 million
years ago. Harrison got hold of garnets that had formed in the
intense pressures of the primary fault in the Himalayas. Inside the
garnets were tiny crystals rich in the element thorium, which
decays into lead 208 with clocklike regularity.
</P>
<P>
   Using the ion microprobe, Harrison was able to measure the
thorium and lead in the crystals and was surprised to discover that
they were only 4 to 8 million years old. The Himalayas actually
arose over 10 million years more recently than anyone had thought.
</P>
<P>
   As researchers continue to explore the Cameca 1270's powers,
Harrison believes that the only limit they will encounter won't be
the machine's technical capabilities but the inherent limits in the
isotopes themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get to smaller and smaller domains _ to see
behavior, to see gradients, to see signals that we haven't had
access to before. But because we are looking at such small domains,
with relatively few atoms, we are beginning to run into the
statistical limits of our chronometers,'' Harrison says. ``It's not
a problem now, but in a few years we'll have to deal with it.''

   If you want to see a time machine, go to room 2677 on the second
floor of the geology building at UCLA. Once you pass into the inner
sanctum, you are faced with a 5-foot-tall, 20-foot-wide piece of
equipment housed in stainless steel. This is the time machine.
</P>
<P>
   This device, however, will not accept human passengers. What
goes inside is a flake of rock. By analyzing the atoms in the rock,
this machine can take you back to the time when the Himalayas
arose, or when life appeared on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The official name of this place is the National Science
Foundation/Keck Foundation National Ion Microprobe Facility. The
name of the machine is the Cameca 1270.
</P>
<P>
   There are other ion microprobes, but the one at UCLA is by far
the best. They all work by sorting and counting isotopes.
</P>
<P>
   If you remember basic chemistry, you'll recall that isotopes are
the various forms an element can take. Once created, many isotopes
are stable.
</P>
<P>
   Carbon 12 and carbon 13, for example, can be found in our solar
system in the same ratio that they were in when the solar system
formed some 4.5 billion years ago. Living things prefer carbon 12
to carbon 13, so the minerals and fossils that have contained life
always have more, relative to nonliving things, of the lighter
isotope.
</P>
<P>
   Not all isotopes are stable, though. Some will release particles
and metamorphose into entirely different elements, and they do so
at a predictable rate. Some break down after just fractions of a
second; others in quadrillions of years. Isotopes can thus act as
clocks, each working on its own timescale.
</P>
<P>
   But decoding the history written in isotopes is not simple,
because it is sometimes inscribed on mineral crystals only a few
thousandths of an inch across, buried inside younger rock. To
detect them, you need an ion microprobe _ ideally, UCLA's ion
microprobe.
</P>
<P>
   The UCLA machine is the brainchild of isotopic chemist Mark
Harrison. It analyzes isotopes by liberating them from the rock
that holds them captive.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers embed the target flake in a one-inch block of resin
and fire a beam of charged atoms, or ions, at the block. When the
beam strikes the sample, some of its momentum is transferred to the
atoms on the surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them will have enough energy imparted to them that
they'll ionize,'' Harrison says.
</P>
<P>
   These new ions form a cloud, which the microprobe can corral in
a 10,000-volt electric field. The ions can then be sorted by their
charge and by their mass as they pass through a giant magnet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heavier ions take a wider path through the magnet because the
magnet is unable to deflect them as much,'' Harrison says.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the ions crash into a detector at the end of the
machine in an orderly ranking.

<P>
   People can talk. Other animals can't. The birds and beasts can
use signals to attract, threaten or alert each other, but they
can't ask questions, strike bargains, tell stories or lay out a
plan of action. Those skills make Homo sapiens a uniquely
successful, powerful and dangerous mammal.
</P>
<P>
   Other creatures' signals carry only a few limited kinds of
information about what's happening at the moment, but language lets
us tell each other in limitless detail about what used to be or
will be or might be.
</P>
<P>
   Without language, we would be only a sort of upright chimpanzee
with funny feet and clever hands. With it, we are the
self-possessed masters of the planet.
</P>
<P>
   We can reasonably assume that by at least 30,000 years ago
people were talking _ at any rate, they were producing tokens of
art and religion, high-level forms of symbolic behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Language surely goes back further than that, but archaeologists
don't agree on just how far. Paleontologists have pored over the
fossil bones of our ancient relatives in search of evidence for
speech abilities.
</P>
<P>
   All mammals produce their vocal noises by contracting muscles
that compress the rib cage. The air in the lungs is driven out
through the windpipe to the larynx, where it flows between the
vocal cords. These structures vibrate in the breeze, producing a
buzzing sound that becomes the voice.
</P>
<P>
   In people, the larynx lies well below the back of the tongue,
and most of the air goes out through the mouth when we talk. But in
most mammals, including apes, the larynx sticks farther up behind
the tongue, into the back of the nose, and most of the exhaled air
passes out through the nostrils. Nonhuman mammals make mostly nasal
sounds as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Lieberman of Brown University thinks that an apelike
throat persisted for some time in our hominid ancestors. His
studies of fossil jaws and skulls persuade him that a more modern
throat didn't evolve until some 500,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This year my colleague Richard Kay, his student Michelle Balow
and I were able to offer support for Lieberman's ideas from another
part of the hominid body.
</P>
<P>
   The tongue's movements are controlled almost solely by a nerve
called the hypoglossal. In its course from the brain to the tongue,
this nerve passes through a hole in the skull. Kay, Balow and I
found that this bony canal is relatively big in modern humans _
about twice as big in cross section as that of a like-size
chimpanzee.
</P>
<P>
   Our larger canal presumably reflects a bigger hypoglossal nerve,
giving us the precise control over tongue movements that we need
for speech.
</P>
<P>
   We also measured this hole in the skulls of a number of fossil
hominids. Australopithecines have small canals like those of apes,
suggesting that they couldn't talk. But later skulls from the genus
Homo, beginning with a 400,000-year-old skull from Zambia, all have
big, humanlike hypoglossal canals. These are also the skulls that
were the first to house brains as big as our own.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years ago most linguists thought that people learn to talk
through the same sort of behavior reinforcement used in training an
animal to do tricks: When children use a word correctly or produce
a grammatical sentence, they are rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   This picture was swept away in the late 1950s by the
revolutionary ideas of Noam Chomsky. Chomsky argued that we are all
born with the same fundamental grammar hard-wired into our brains,
and we are preprogrammed to pick up the additional rules of the
local language, just as baby ducks are hard-wired to follow the
first big animal they see when they hatch.
</P>
<P>
   If language learning were just a matter of proper training,
Chomsky reasoned, we ought to be able to teach English to lab rats,
or at least to apes.
</P>
<P>
   As we have seen, apes aren't built to talk. But they can be
trained to use sign language or to point to word-symbols on a
keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   Duane Rumbaugh and Sue Savage-Rumbaugh work at the Yerkes
Regional Primate Research Center in Atlanta, where Sue made a
surprising breakthrough with a young bonobo named Kanzi.
</P>
<P>
   Kanzi had watched his mother try to learn signs with little
success. When Sue started with Kanzi, she was astonished to
discover that he already knew the meaning of 12 of the keyboard
symbols. Apparently, he had learned them without any training or
rewards.
</P>
<P>
   In the years that followed, he learned new symbols quickly and
used them both to answer questions and to ``talk'' about things
that he intended to do or had already done. Still more amazingly,
he had a considerable understanding of spoken English _ including
its syntax.
</P>
<P>
   In their forthcoming book, ``Lingua ex Machina,'' neuroscientist
William Calvin of the University of Washington and linguist Derek
Bickerton of the University of Hawaii argue that the ability to
create symbols _ signs that refer to things _ is potentially
present in any animal that can learn to interpret natural signs,
such as a trail of footprints. Syntax, meanwhile, emerges from the
abstract thought required for a social life.
</P>
<P>
   In apes and some other mammals with complex and subtle social
relationships, individuals make alliances and act altruistically
toward others, with the implicit understanding that their favors
will be returned. These foreshadowings of symbols and syntax, they
propose, laid the groundwork for language in a lot of social
animals but didn't create language itself. That had to wait until
our ancestors evolved brains big enough to handle the large-scale
operations needed to generate and process complex strings of signs.
</P>
<P>
   Calvin and Bickerton suggest that brain enlargement in our
ancestry was the result of evolutionary pressures that favored
intelligence and motor coordination for making tools and throwing
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   As a side effect of these selection pressures, human evolution
crossed a threshold at which language became possible.
</P>
<P>
   This account may be wrong in some of its details, but the story
in its broad outlines solves so many puzzles and ties up so many
loose ends that something like it must surely be correct. It also
promises to resolve our conflicting views of the boundary between
people and animals.
</P>
<P>
   The story of language origins sketched above suggests that the
human difference is real and profound, but it is rooted in aspects
of psychology and biology that we share with our close animal
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   If the growing consensus on the origins of language can join
these disparate truths together, it will be a big step forward in
the study of human evolution.

animals but didn't create language itself. That had to wait until
our ancestors evolved brains big enough to handle the large-scale
operations needed to generate and process complex strings of signs.
</P>
<P>
   Calvin and Bickerton suggest that brain enlargement in our
ancestry was the result of evolutionary pressures that favored
intelligence and motor coordination for making tools and throwing
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   As a side effect of these selection pressures, human evolution
crossed a threshold at which language became possible.
</P>
<P>
   This account may be wrong in some of its details, but the story
in its broad outlines solves so many puzzles and ties up so many
loose ends that something like it must surely be correct. It also
promises to resolve our conflicting views of the boundary between
people and animals.
</P>
<P>
   The story of language origins sketched above suggests that the
human difference is real and profound, but it is rooted in aspects
of psychology and biology that we share with our close animal
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   If the growing consensus on the origins of language can join
these disparate truths together, it will be a big step forward in
the study of human evolution.

   BAYINDIR, Turkey _ The great coin discovery of the century
happened almost by chance, rising out of a muddy field to the
shouts of three men who simply thought they struck gold.
</P>
<P>
   Chasing the whir of a hand-held metal detector, three peasants
had rushed to dig a hole, kneeling in soil still wet with rain.
When hundreds of shining pieces began to appear, overflowing from a
jar lodged in the earth, they jumped up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are rich!'' yelled Ibrahim Basbug. ``We are rich!''
</P>
<P>
   It was, for a brief moment on April 18, 1984, a modern
leprechaun tale. But almost as quickly as the peasants could stuff
the coins into paper bags, exhuming Athenian decadrachms buried
more than 2,000 years earlier, an epic saga with remarkable twists
was beginning to unfold.
</P>
<P>
   In the years that followed _ as the silver slipped out of
Turkey, allegedly into the hands of smugglers and US collectors _
it would prompt a lawsuit in Boston federal court, entangling two
Harvard classmates and an eccentric billionaire, William I. Koch.
Academics would wring their hands over the fate of one the world's
premiere antiquities finds. The peasants would go to jail.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, as two sides prepare for a trial that pits the
Republic of Turkey against the owners of the disputed coins, a
moral dilemma persists: Who has a rightful claim to such rare
vestiges of the past?
</P>
<P>
   In the shadows of the controversy is the Boston Museum of Fine
Arts, where the disputed coins were authenticated. A year ago, on
another antiquities issue, the MFA came under fire for acquiring
pre-Columbian artifacts, despite evidence they were illegally
smuggled out of Guatemala. Cornelius C. Vermeule III, curator of
the MFA's classical art department for four decades until his
retirement in 1996, encouraged Koch to buy the coins. Even after
Vermeule received a warning that Turkish authorities were looking
for plundered coins, he continued to reassure Koch that his
purchase would give ``no cause for regret.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, the coins are locked in a Florida bank vault held by
Koch, an investor best known for his family's $35 billion oil
company and his 1992 America's Cup win. Rarely shy of a good court
brawl _ he once took his mistress, Catherine de Castelbajac, to
Boston housing court to evict her from his Four Seasons penthouse,
and last summer sued his own brothers for $2 billion of the family
share _ Koch has shown no interest in returning the treasure out of
good will.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does he see a need to. Along with Jonathan H. Kagan and
Jeffrey Spier _ friends from Harvard and co-partners in OKS, the
corporation that bought the coins _ Koch says he acted in good
faith in 1984. Furthermore, Koch added in a statement provided to
the Globe last week, his is an entirely different hoard _ not the
so-called ``Elmali hoard'' plundered illegally that year.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish officials have amassed evidence to the contrary,
including correspondence from foreign experts and essays by Spier
himself. They present an apparently simple case: Although some 36
civilizations have occupied Turkish soil over time, the hoard is
part of the country's ``national heritage,'' which the United
States has agreed to respect since signing the 1970 UNESCO treaty
condemning illegal antiquities trades.
</P>
<P>
   But the international community has also suffered from the loss,
according to even those who would see the hoard sent back. Ozgen
Acar, a Turkish investigative journalist who helped break the
story, says the coins ``belong to all of humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This hoard is a very important part of a historic chain,''
Acar said, passionately describing the Greek battle victories that
might explain the coins' burial, presumably around 465 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ahmet Ali Senturk, a 68-year-old farmer from Bayindir, is one of
the three who discovered the coins after their 24-century
interment. Fourteen years later, Senturk is plagued by the
discovery, he said during an interview in his home. And he is
baffled by the amount Koch and his partners allegedly paid _
roughly $3 million for some 1,700 of the coins.
</P>
<P>
   Seated cross-legged on a faded cushion in his mud hut, Senturk
gazed out the window in silence. Donkeys bleated outside, and as
his wife, Huriye, served cups of yogurt milk, Senturk began to talk
about the find, which brought him $80 and a year in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that, if it was the same experience, I would leave them
in the ground,'' he said. ``I wouldn't touch it.''
</P>
<P>
   It started as a lark. Two local men, Bayram Sungur and Ibrahim
Basbug, had been scouring the fields with a metal detector for days
_ common sport in Anatolia, where piles of relics are unearthed
illegally every year. They were about to admit defeat when they
encountered Senturk on a village path. Senturk insisted they
demonstrate the gadget.
</P>
<P>
   They piled into Senturk's yellow Fiat _ the only car in the
500-resident town _ and drove down the hillside to an open farming
strip. Basbug got out and waved the machine in the direction of the
ground. It buzzed right away.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The men assumed it was a fluke. But when the detector kept
responding to the site _ and none other _ they began to dig the
soil with their hands.
</P>
<P>
   And there, just inches beneath the surface, were the coins _
``big, small, many,'' Senturk recalled. ``Ibrahim was shouting, `We
are rich! We are rich!' And I said, let's go to the police. If we
give it to them, they will give us a percentage.''
</P>
<P>
   Basbug kissed his friend on the cheek with excitement. ``Nobody
will hear about it,'' he told Senturk. ``It will be quiet. Even the
roosters in Istanbul won't be heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Senturk drove to Basbug's house, where they stayed up until
dawn, counting and washing off some 1,900 coins. The next day,
Basbug and Sungur drove to the port city of Antalya to get them
appraised, Senturk said. When two pieces sold for about $200 each,
they began to realize what they had; Basbug and Sungur flew to
Istanbul, tracking down a well-connected smuggler, Fuat Aydiner, in
the Grand Bazaar, to unload the rest.
</P>
<P>
   But the discoverers' fortunes soon began to reverse. After the
sale in Istanbul, two of the peasants were arrested by police
acting on a tip. Basbug, Senturk said, had spent the windfall on an
alcoholic binge, during which he stood in the middle of the street
and shouted, ``We are the three richest men in Turkey!'' He then
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him (after he was caught two years later), `Is this
the rooster that nobody would hear?' '' Senturk recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Senturk and Sungur were tried and convicted. Senturk spent a
year in jail, and spent the following decade ``getting better''
after the ordeal. But he did not forget the coins: Last year,
Senturk testified in preparation for the Turkish lawsuit, examining
200 photographs of Koch's coins.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt in my mind that these coins are among the
coins that we dug up in the field,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By the time the peasants were caught, the hoard had been
launched on its international journey, slipping across the border
of Turkey into Germany, and ultimately into the hands of American
numismatists who knew how extraordinary it was, according to
documents filed in Boston federal court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of the King Tut of numismatic discoveries,'' said
Thomas Hoving, former director of the Metropolitan Museum in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Aydiner, the Istanbul smuggler, had spent more than $500,000 on
the hoard, a relative pittance, especially for a cache that
included 13 rare Athenian decadrachms, of which there are only 30
in the world, and the other 1,000 Lycian coins.
</P>
<P>
   Aydiner then nearly doubled the price, reselling it to a group
of renowned smugglers in Munich _ including Edip Telliagaoglu, a
convict nicknamed ``blind Edip,'' who had a forbidding reputation,
according to court papers.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Turkish officials allege, when the dealers started
peddling the hoard around Europe, their dodgy backgrounds failed to
dissuade one erudite buyer: Jeffrey Spier, then an archeology PhD
candidate at Oxford University. He flew to Munich, setting in
motion a purchase that Turkish officials say became part of his
doctoral thesis _ and, ultimately, spurred the long dispute.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing the coins, court documents allege, Spier called
Jonathan Kagan, a friend who graduated a year behind him at
Harvard, in 1978. Kagan, also a classics enthusiast and a director
at the investment firm Lazard Freres, then mentioned the potential
purchase to a man who could afford the valuable prize: William
Koch.
</P>
<P>
   Koch would eventually become a fixture of flamboyance in
Massachusetts, annoying his neighbors on Cape Cod with helicopter
traffic, publicly evicting his mistress from his luxury condo, and
battling the state for what is believed to be the biggest tax
refund in history, $47.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   But conscientiousness was not his trademark even in 1984,
Turkish officials allege. After agreeing to buy into the
collection, Koch had it authenticated by Vermeule, an equally
idiosyncratic character known for his fluency in seven languages
and razor-sharp memory.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, in July, 1984, Vermeule received a letter
from Silvia Hurter, a manager at Bank Leu in Switzerland, who said
Turkish authorities were reportedly looking for the illegally
smuggled hoard. One month later, according to court documents,
Vermeule sent an official letter telling Koch not to worry. He
apparently took the advice.
</P>
<P>
   Yet other reasons for concern started cropping up. Almost
immediately after the sale, Koch and his partners decided they had
been cheated, and sued the Munich dealers for pieces that were
withheld. Then, in 1986, Acar, heard about the alleged smuggling
operation and began working on a story.
</P>
<P>
   Other collectors were becoming suspicious. Bruce McNall, the
former owner of the Los Angeles Kings, had put 10 pieces up for
sale; he returned them to Turkey in 1988 when their origins were
questioned.
</P>
<P>
   The same year, court papers said, Vermeule wrote to Koch: ``It
would be wise to let dust settle before exhibiting the coins. One
doesn't want a process server from the Turkish Embassy's New York
lawyers!''
</P>
<P>
   Turkey filed suit in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Koch and his partners deny their coins those unearthed by
Senturk. By their account, Spier first saw his coins on Feb. 22,
1984, two months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   And in an interview last week, Vermeule also denied the disputed
coins could have come from Turkey _ despite the warnings he issued
to Koch in 1984 and 1988. He also said the letter from Hurter was
about a hoard ``that may well not be Mr. Koch's coins.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether that argument will succeed will be determined in court.
In the meantime, according to Ricardo J. Elia, associate archeology
professor at Boston University, the loser is the community at
large.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like taking a history book and ripping out the pages,''
Elia said. ``Turkey is responsible for protecting all these
centuries of history within its borders. Who else is supposed to
protect it?''

WILLIAM WELD, WHERE HE WANTS TO BE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT LEHIGH AND FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was Bill Weld Wednesday, right where he says he doesn't
want to be: in the limelight. And his inner circle was just as
surprised as everyone else to see him there.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't tell anyone,'' said one friend. ``I think he was
afraid of what the response would be.''
</P>
<P>
   It would have been: Stay away. Avoid it like the plague. Don't
embarrass yourself. The safety rule for any Republican _
particularly a former governor of a liberal state who was already
viewed with suspicion by the party's conservative national
leadership _ is not to cross congressional barons intent on
impeaching the president.
</P>
<P>
   But Weld remains what he has always been _ unpredictable.
Calculatingly unpredictable. He can never be taken quite at face
value; he's always striving to appear something other than what he
is. Whatever that is.
</P>
<P>
   His inimitability _ plus a look ahead to presidential election
year 2004 _ helps explain Weld's presence in the capital Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   For all his talk about the joys of being a private citizen once
again, Weld craves the limelight _ and indeed, in his own subtle
way, is masterful in its pursuit. ``It's like jumping into the
Charles River,'' mused one Weld friend, recalling the day the
governor did just that to publicize the passage of river cleanup
legislation. Meanwhile, the House Judiciary Committee hearings
droned on, with the redhead sitting at center stage.
</P>
<P>
   And though Weld walked away from public life last year, he
hardly sees his political life as over. Despite his storied sang
froid, his supposed take-it-or-leave-it attitude, Weld cares deeply
about his career as a politician.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like malaria,'' says a longtime Weld chum. ``You don't
see it now, but I am sure the fever will break out somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in 1996, Weld displayed resolute good cheer and
studied nonchalance after his failed challenge to US Senator John
F. Kerry. But privately, he appeared so down over the defeat that
close friends worried about him. A Senate seat was all he had ever
wanted, a morose Weld confided to one friend at the time.
</P>
<P>
   That same love of public life is why Weld fought so tenaciously
for the Mexican ambassadorship, pressing a fight in the Senate that
the Clinton White House didn't necessarily want to engage.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why it would be foolish to believe Weld's avowals that
the political fire inside has burned out.
</P>
<P>
   No, he won't be looking at running for national office in 2000,
though there is always the prospect of a Cabinet post.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Republican Party loses again _ as Weld believes will
happen if it nominates a social conservative _ then by 2004, he
thinks, the party may be willing to move toward the center. If so,
he's told friends, he'll look seriously at running.
</P>
<P>
   That long-range aspiration helps explain both Weld's efforts to
maintain his profile and his efforts to bolster the Republican
center.
</P>
<P>
   Weld was speaking to that sensible center on Wednesday _ and to
the party he hopes will emerge in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, some advisers worry he hurt himself. ``This is
different from taking moderate positions on some issues,'' laments
one. ``This will be seen as aiding the enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a week or so ago, Weld aimed at the same moderate
mainstream in an op-ed piece in The New York Times. There, he
preached his own brand of ``light-touch'' Republicanism, laying out
a center way between ``the Democratic left, in hock to unions and
trial lawyers, and the so-called Republican cultural right, in
thrall to homophobia and xenophobia.'' That middle way is not so
very different from the course Bill Clinton steered between what he
called the ``brain dead politics'' of right and left in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   And it comports with Weld's own inner timetable. As he has said
in the past, he sees his career in seven-year increments. He was a
prosecutor for about that long, he spent about that long as
governor, and by 2004 he will have spent about that long as a
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, that lawyering may itself be proving a disappointment.
Recall that Weld's initial private-sector goal was to be a venture
capitalist _ a goal that elicited naught but a yawn from the world
of venture capital.
</P>
<P>
   After several trips to Wall Street, a humbled Weld _ well, at
least quasi-humbled _ instead joined his onetime underling, Bob
Cordy, at the firm McDermott Will &AMP; Emery.
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, Weld has done well, carrying his own weight,
his partners say. And yet the money may not be quite what he hoped
to be making. Friends speculate that a need to overcompensate has
led to Weld's recent offputting talk of money: his boasts about the
``big bucks'' he regularly claims to be making, his dismissive
reference to the $100,000 advance for his recent first novel as ``a
tiny little check.''
</P>
<P>
   Such talk is the middle-age corollary of the preppie affectation
of casual brilliance, the Harvard student who claimed to have
dashed off his thesis between Hasty Pudding performances, the pose
of the perpetual partier in a student secretly scoring summa cum
laude grades.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there's Weld's insistence that he must sock away
$15 million before ever considering a return to politics.
</P>
<P>
   Don't count on it. As Weld showed Wednesday, he can hardly stay
away.

   December can be a frustrating month for those who want to
proclaim the joy of science along with the joy of the season. It
can be especially difficult for parents looking for gifts to please
their little ones. What follows are some of the best toys on the
market for the up-and-coming scientists in your family.
</P>
<P>
   -----
 &UR; YEAR OF THE ROBOT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year NASA's Sojourner robot caught the world's attention as
it trolled across the Martian landscape, sniffing alien rocks and
radioing back information about their composition.
</P>
<P>
   Images of the intrepid rover at work not only gave us a new
sense of Mars _ they also conveyed a powerful message about how
robots are extending the reach of human exploration, and human
imagination, to other worlds.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, robots are well represented among the
science-themed toys this season.
</P>
<P>
   By far the year's most radical new toy _ if it can in fact be
called a toy _ is lego's Mindstorms ($200, LEGO, 800-453-4652,
www.legomindstorms.com). This kit, the product of a lengthy
collaboration with MIT's Media Lab, lets aspiring roboticists (age
12 to very adult) build and program their own mechanical creations.
</P>
<P>
   Commands for the robot are written on a personal computer using
lego's custom-designed software. It assumes no previous programming
experience and incorporates a reassuring tutorial to guide novices
through the basics.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than writing actual lines of computer code, you string
together graphic blocks, each representing a single instruction for
the robot.
</P>
<P>
   When you are done, you download the program to the robot's
onboard microprocessor using an infrared transmitter, and it's
ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   The kit provides instructions for 12 projects, such as an
intruder alarm and a trail tracker. Two expansion packs, $50 each,
that will allow the construction of more complicated robots should
be available soon.
</P>
<P>
   Do not expect Mindstorms to be all plug and play. The print and
computer guides give you extensive help; further advice is
available on the company's Web site. But LEGO wants you to use your
brain and figure things out on your own.
</P>
<P>
   If your heart is set on actual NASA robots, Learning Curve has
the toys for you. The Robotix Mars Discovery Pack ($9.99, Learning
Curve, 800-704-8697) lets you build a tolerably accurate replica of
Sojourner, complete with antenna and alpha proton X-ray
spectrometer. You can add a power pack to make your Sojourner move
on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Learning Curve has instructions on its Web site
(www.learningcurve.com) for constructing a much more detailed
Sojourner using parts from several of the company's robot kits.
</P>
<P>
   The company also sells the Volcanic Crawler, $49.99, a
self-powered model of Dante, the volcano-explorer robot. With its
rolling, insectlike gait, the crawler conveys how Dante traversed
obstacles during its infernal mission.
</P>
<P>
   If you get bored following NASA's lead, you can snap together
the intricately molded Robotix parts into a mechanical brute of
your own design.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DYNAMICS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even the simplest mechanical toys can still provide a great deal
of enjoyment if properly designed.
</P>
<P>
   For example, you can really let your imagination go with Zoobs
($39.99 for a 120-unit set, Primordial, 415-923-1895,
www.zoob.com). These brightly colored plastic parts snap together
in ball-and-socket arrangements fashioned after the plastic models
used to represent the atoms in a molecule.
</P>
<P>
   The accompanying guidebook shows how to assemble the Zoob units
into various playful forms: a person, a Tyrannosaurus rex, a
helicopter, even a crown that looks like one of Harold Edgerton's
milk-drop photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Building the larger constructions takes some work. Fortunately,
the instructions are straightforward and the design of the zoobs is
inherently forgiving.
</P>

   December can be a frustrating month for those who want to
proclaim the joy of science along with the joy of the season. It
can be especially difficult for parents looking for gifts to please
their little ones. What follows are some of the best toys on the
market for the up-and-coming scientists in your family.
</P>
<P>
   -----
 &UR; YEAR OF THE ROBOT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year NASA's Sojourner robot caught the world's attention as
it trolled across the Martian landscape, sniffing alien rocks and
radioing back information about their composition.
</P>
<P>
   Images of the intrepid rover at work not only gave us a new
sense of Mars _ they also conveyed a powerful message about how
robots are extending the reach of human exploration, and human
imagination, to other worlds.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, robots are well represented among the
science-themed toys this season.
</P>
<P>
   By far the year's most radical new toy _ if it can in fact be
called a toy _ is lego's Mindstorms ($200, LEGO, 800-453-4652,
www.legomindstorms.com). This kit, the product of a lengthy
collaboration with MIT's Media Lab, lets aspiring roboticists (age
12 to very adult) build and program their own mechanical creations.
</P>
<P>
   Commands for the robot are written on a personal computer using
lego's custom-designed software. It assumes no previous programming
experience and incorporates a reassuring tutorial to guide novices
through the basics.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than writing actual lines of computer code, you string
together graphic blocks, each representing a single instruction for
the robot.
</P>
<P>
   When you are done, you download the program to the robot's
onboard microprocessor using an infrared transmitter, and it's
ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   The kit provides instructions for 12 projects, such as an
intruder alarm and a trail tracker. Two expansion packs, $50 each,
that will allow the construction of more complicated robots should
be available soon.
</P>
<P>
   Do not expect Mindstorms to be all plug and play. The print and
computer guides give you extensive help; further advice is
available on the company's Web site. But LEGO wants you to use your
brain and figure things out on your own.
</P>
<P>
   If your heart is set on actual NASA robots, Learning Curve has
the toys for you. The Robotix Mars Discovery Pack ($9.99, Learning
Curve, 800-704-8697) lets you build a tolerably accurate replica of
Sojourner, complete with antenna and alpha proton X-ray
spectrometer. You can add a power pack to make your Sojourner move
on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Learning Curve has instructions on its Web site
(www.learningcurve.com) for constructing a much more detailed
Sojourner using parts from several of the company's robot kits.
</P>
<P>
   The company also sells the Volcanic Crawler, $49.99, a
self-powered model of Dante, the volcano-explorer robot. With its
rolling, insectlike gait, the crawler conveys how Dante traversed
obstacles during its infernal mission.
</P>
<P>
   If you get bored following NASA's lead, you can snap together
the intricately molded Robotix parts into a mechanical brute of
your own design.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DYNAMICS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even the simplest mechanical toys can still provide a great deal
of enjoyment if properly designed.
</P>
<P>
   For example, you can really let your imagination go with Zoobs
($39.99 for a 120-unit set, Primordial, 415-923-1895,
www.zoob.com). These brightly colored plastic parts snap together
in ball-and-socket arrangements fashioned after the plastic models
used to represent the atoms in a molecule.
</P>
<P>
   The accompanying guidebook shows how to assemble the Zoob units
into various playful forms: a person, a Tyrannosaurus rex, a
helicopter, even a crown that looks like one of Harold Edgerton's
milk-drop photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Building the larger constructions takes some work. Fortunately,
the instructions are straightforward and the design of the zoobs is
inherently forgiving.
</P>
<P>
   In a lighter vein, Draganfly Innovations has brought to our
planet the Remote Controlled Flying Saucer ($87, 800-979-9794). The
saucer is a two-foot-wide silver Mylar balloon that must be filled
with helium. A dual-fan propulsion unit and ballast putty attach to
the balloon's underside.
</P>
<P>
   Using the remote control, you can make the saucer turn, go
forward, and ascend and descend (a breeze could quickly whisk it
away, so this toy must stay indoors).
</P>
<P>

DEADLY MIXUPS IN NURSING HOMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Last March 26, as an 88-year-old breast cancer patient moaned
in agony despite taking a standard painkiller, a hospice nurse
advised the staff at her nursing home to give her Roxanol, an oral
form of the narcotic morphine.
</P>
<P>
   The woman didn't receive the first dose until another 13 hours
had passed _ and then a distracted nurse at the Randolph Crossings
Nursing Center failed to catch a deadly labeling mistake on the
Roxanol bottle sent by an off-site pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give 5cc. (equals) 100 mg'' every four hours, the pharmacy
label read, meaning five cubic centimeters or 100 milligrams.
That's 20 times the prescribed amount _ a lethal dose. Indeed, the
woman died later that day, leaving lawyers to wrangle over whether
it was the undisputed morphine overdose or her terminal cancer that
killed her.
</P>
<P>
   The nurse on duty ``indicated that she was aware that this was a
large dose of Roxanol,'' notes a federal investigative report.
``She indicated that she was the only nurse on this 40-bed unit and
that she had been very busy.''
</P>
<P>
   Medication blunders occur all the time _ even in the most
prestigious institutions _ and those that happen in hospitals have
been getting overdue attention in recent years. But errors in
nursing homes, which care for the oldest, sickest, most vulnerable
patients in the health care system, are just beginning to appear on
the radar screens of regulators, researchers, and health
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   How often do medication errors happen in nursing homes?
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer is, nobody knows,'' says Stephen Feldman, a
pharmacist who has worked with nursing homes for 26 years. ``That's
because traditionally the reporting of medication errors has been
minimal. People think if you talk about it, it invites legal
liability, and if you don't talk about it, it will go away.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt the opportunity for errors is greater in
nursing homes than hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   First, the average nursing home patient is on more than eight
medications. Then there's the sheer number of patients. At any
given time, about 55,000 patients reside in Massachusetts' 600
nursing homes, compared to around 10,200 overnight patients in the
72 acute-care hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, nursing home residents ``are in many ways a
forgotten population of 1.5 million people,'' says Dr. Jerry
Gurwitz, of University of Massachusetts Medical School and Fallon
Clinic in Worcester.
</P>
<P>
   Gurwitz and Dr. David Bates of Brigham and Women's Hospital just
completed a study of medication errors in 18 Bay State nursing
homes. While declining to share the unpublished results, Gurwitz
says: ``Clearly there has been under-recognition and
under-reporting of adverse drug events. Spontaneous reporting
systems don't work in identifying even a fraction of events, and
they often miss very important events.''
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts health officials this year began to keep closer
track of nursing home medication mistakes. The effort is partly an
outgrowth of a 1994 chemotherapy overdose at Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute that led to the death of Boston Globe health columnist
Betsy A. Lehman and cardiac damage in another patient, according to
assistant health commissioner Nancy Ridley.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the shot heard 'round the world when it comes to
medication errors,'' Ridley says.
</P>
<P>
   According to records obtained through the Freedom of Information
Act, the state received reports of 27 such errors in nursing homes,
involving five deaths, in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials believe this may represent the total number
of such incidents during the two-year period. ``Medication errors
are tracked and have to be reported to the state,'' notes Ann
Turner of the Massachusetts Extended Care Federation, an industry
group.
</P>
<P>
   Others disagree. Often nursing home administrators insist they
have had no medication errors, Feldman says, ``but it's very clear
to me they happen. I truly believe that nursing directors are
usually unaware that they're happening. When something happens all
the time that isn't a good thing, people think of it as normal and
stop perceiving it as a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   One clue: When state officials go out to investigate, they
usually find incidents, major and minor, that went unreported.
``There's no question that what gets reported to us is the tip of
the iceberg,'' Ridley says. ``In fact, it's the molecule at the tip
of the iceberg.''
</P>
<P>
   Randolph Crossings, now called Sunrise Care and Rehabilitation
Center of Randolph, Mass., is a case in point. The ``sentinel
event'' that drew officials' attention to the facility was the
death last December 23 of a 49-year-old man.
</P>
<P>
   The man had an alarmingly high blood level of potassium,
possibly due to dialysis to treat kidney failure. Alerted to the
situation, his doctor ordered an immediate dose of a drug called
Kayexalate to reduce his potassium levels; too much potassium can
disrupt heart rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   The man never got the intended drug. Not only that, but a nurse
on the evening shift gave the patient his routine daily dose of a
potassium supplement at 6 p.m., almost three hours after the doctor
ordered the potassium-reducing medication.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours later, the man was found dead of cardiac arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The incident precipitated a full-scale review of Randolph
Crossings that unearthed serious deficiencies of all kinds. The
state inspection ``evidenced a pattern of medication errors that
placed residents at immediate and serious risk,'' according to the
state report. ``At a minimum there were 15 significant medication
errors'' between January 21 and March 31 this year.
</P>
<P>
   The findings caused the federal Health Care Financing
Administration to levy a $637,000 fine on the facility this year.
The agency is also trying to bar it from receiving Medicare and
Medicaid funds _ which would force it to close _ but the nursing
home's parent company in Albequerque has won an injunction blocking
that step for now.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Goodman, a spokeswoman for Sun HealthCare Group, which
owns that facility, 33 others in Massachusetts and more than 400
nationally, says the company has corrected the problems in Randolph
and that last month the facility was declared ``in substantial
compliance'' with state regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always strive for perfection and, unfortunately, we don't
always achieve it _ and neither can anybody when something is being
done by human hands,'' Goodman said. ``We reported the errors. I
don't believe there has been direct cause and effect established,
that the medication errors caused the two deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
AVOIDING NURSING HOME PROBLEMS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nursing home residents can do only so much to avoid becoming the
victim of a medication error. Many are too sick, too confused, or
too demented to keep track of what pill, injection, or IV medicine
they're supposed to get, and when.
</P>
<P>
   But families can be an important check on the process, say those
close to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Families should take advantage of a 1987 federal law that
requires nursing homes to meet with relatives every three months to
discuss care plans, advises Adelina Healy, director of nursing at
Wingate of Wilbraham, a 130-bed nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   The medications a resident is taking, and why, should be at the
top of the agenda. The federal law mandating such meetings ``has
made long-term care much better,'' Healy says.
</P>
<P>
   Families are sometimes in a better position than often-transient
nursing staffers to recognize when a patient's physical or mental
condition has changed. ``If family members notice a change in how
their loved one is functioning, the first question to ask is if
there has been any change in medications,'' advises Dr. David Bates
of Brigham and Women's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent study conducted with Dr. Jerry Gurwitz of Fallon
Clinic, Bates says, ``Many of the problems we saw occurred after
some change had occurred and no one had put two and two together.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Coyle of the state Department of Public Health urges
families to be aware of medication side effects ``that could
masquerade as other medical problems,'' and to be familiar with
their loved one's drug regimen. They should also periodically
request to see the medical record, check the Medication
Administration Record against physicians' orders, and review the
required monthly pharmacist's assessment.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, however, nursing home residents and families must
depend on facility staffers, and that's often the weak link. ``We
have found there is clearly a lack of medication knowledge among
the staff,'' says Lori Bassinger, a pharmacist consultant for the
state.
</P>
<P>
   The health department plans to issue recommendations soon urging
nursing homes to test all new professional staffers on their
medication knowledge, and possibly existing staff too. Because of a
recent spate of morphine overdose deaths, the state will circulate
charts designed to help nurses calculate safe doses and head off
potentially lethal mistakes.

GOP FUTURE MAY HINGE ON IMPEACHMENT VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This week's drama on Capitol Hill hinges on whether
moderate Republicans will band together and save President Clinton
from being impeached. But after they vote, the question is whether
moderates will have a place in the Republican Party at all.
</P>
<P>
   By some accounts, it is not just Clinton's fate at stake this
week, but also the fate of the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``My party has focused almost exclusively on the president,''
said Representative Christopher Shays of Connecticut, one of the
GOP's leading moderates and an impeachment foe. Shays worries that
much of 1999 will be focused on a Senate impeachment trial instead
of the Republican economic and social agenda.
</P>
<P>
   This is only the latest twist for a party that, just a month
ago, declared it was turning toward the middle after the midterm
elections. When the party lost five House seats instead of picking
up an expected dozen or two, House Speaker Newt Gingrich resigned
amid widespread expectations the party would drop its effort to
impeach Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But the opposite has occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The party has pushed for impeachment even more strongly than
before the November election, with much of the effort directed by
the most conservative members, such as the House majority whip, Tom
DeLay of Texas. The speaker-elect, Bob Livingston, has yet to
emerge as the moderate voice some expected.
</P>
<P>
   This has led Democrats to assert, perhaps too hopefully, that
impeachment will backfire on the Republican Party. No sooner did
the House Judiciary Committee approve the first three of four
articles of impeachment on Friday than Clinton's former press
secretary, Dee Dee Myers, suggested on CNN that a Senate trial
would result in a Democratic takeover of Congress in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican Party will have hell to pay with the American
people,'' Myers said.
</P>
<P>
   The most immediate impact could be on some members who back
impeachment and represent moderate and Democrat-leaning districts.
In several cases in last month's election, outspoken Republican
proponents of impeachment were defeated by Democrats who made
impeachment a campaign issue. Political analyst Stu Rothenberg said
GOP moderates who vote against impeachment are likely to face
primary challenges from conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   But given this year's roller-coaster events, Rothenberg said, it
may be too early to start writing the political obituary for any
party or politician, including the president.
</P>
<P>
   Just as most voters tell pollsters they approve of Clinton's job
performance primarily for the economy, voters may not care about
the Republican Party's impeachment performance if they believe the
GOP has the right agenda for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Republican National Committee spokesman Mike Collins rebutted
any suggestion that the impeachment battle would cast his party out
of the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``The central themes of this party do attract the American
middle,'' Collins said. ``Putting more money back into the hands of
those who earned it, saving Social Security, a good pension and
retirement _ those are themes that move to the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the impeachment vote, Collins said Republicans ``are
approaching this in a sober, serious, and careful manner, and they
are clearly searching their consciences. That can only help them.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the Senate is tied up in a grueling impeachment trial, it
may be impossible to focus on anything but the president's fate.
While it is widely thought that a trial would take about four
months, some Republican leadership aides have said Senate majority
leader Trent Lott would prefer to limit it to a couple of weeks, so
the party can bring other issues to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans see a bright side to all this. Presuming the
Senate fails to come up with the necessary two-thirds vote to
convict and oust Clinton, Republicans expect Clinton would limp
through his last two years as president, so deeply wounded
politically that Republicans would set the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   But that may be as much wishful thinking as the Democrats' hope
that impeachment will backfire on the GOP. The bottom line is that
the Republican Party's poor performance in the November elections
ensured that Democrats could still kill legislation they do not
like, because the Republicans' 55-45 majority in the Senate is
short of the 60 votes needed to stop a filibuster. Clinton,
meanwhile, retains his veto power.

   The real direction of the Republican Party is likely to be
determined by the 2000 presidential campaign. The current political
thinking is that an outsider like Texas Governor George W. Bush
will seek and win the Republican nomination. Bush, of course, is
playing no role in the impeachment debate. Yet as a self-declared
``compassionate conservative,'' he already is under attack by some
in the party's right wing for being too moderate. ``The Democratic
Party's Achilles' heel is the far left, and the Republican Party's
Achilles' heel is the far right,'' Shays said. The public might
react negatively if Republicans are viewed as ``a far right party
more into ideology than governing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The question, according to Shays, is whether the public will
perceive possible impeachment and a Senate trial as a manifestation
of Republican ideology or as the consummate duty of governing. ``I
honestly don't know,'' Shays said.

CHINA'S ARMY LOSING ITS BUSINESS EMPIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ It is hard to spend money in China without funding
the People's Liberation Army. Whether you stay at Beijing's luxury
Palace Hotel or buy real estate, whether you play golf or use a
mobile telephone, your money is probably going to the coffers of
the world's largest military.
</P>
<P>
   The PLA &UR;  &LR; has come a long way from its roots as a band of
peasant-revolutionaries who captured weapons from the enemy and
grew their own food to survive. Today, through a mind-boggling
network of 15,000 businesses, the PLA makes billions of dollars a
year to boost its budget.
</P>
<P>
   But its foray into commerce has bred corruption and crime, and
distracted soldiers from defending the nation. It has also created
unfair competition for other businesses, and fueled resentment
among civilians who say the PLA has become an army of profit-hungry
mercenaries. So after 13 years of building a commercial empire with
the blessings of Beijing, the PLA has been told its days of
money-making are over.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the government's effort to reform the economy and
rout out corruption, President Jiang Zemin has ordered the military
to divest its commercial interests by Tuesday. The government will
then run the companies or sell them off, and debt-plagued firms
will be shut down. The state has vowed to supplement the military
budget to make up the shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   Drumming the PLA out of business is a bold move that will test
the staying power of Jiang, a leader once seen as weak and
transitional, who has staked his legacy on reform. Jiang is the
first modern Chinese leader without a military background, and
asserting his authority over the PLA is a risky gambit.
</P>
<P>
   If the plan works, it will fundamentally alter the way a growing
military power funds itself and could strengthen the PLA by
restoring discipline and preparedness. It would also reduce the
costly problems of smuggling and copyright piracy, and create a
fairer economic playing field in China.
</P>
<P>
   If the move fails, it would be a major defeat for Jiang, and the
military could succumb to widespread corruption like some other
Asian armed forces. How the PLA copes with this transition will
show a lot about its willingness to be a professional defense force
that serves the state rather than itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be an effort to hold onto the most profitable
enterprises and get rid of the money-losing ones. That's the nature
of reform in China _ everyone tries to keep their finger in the
pie,'' said Tai Ming Cheung, a Hong Kong-based PLA analyst and
author of the soon-to-be-released ``China's Entrepreneurial Army.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is: Do the authorities have sufficient manpower
and authority to enforce this? They tend to be very energetic for
the first months, and then run out of steam,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's true the state asked the PLA to halt enterprise in 1993,
but was largely ignored. Even now, the State Economic and Trade
Commission has only a few dozen people overseeing the transfer of
hundreds of thousands of employees and billions of dollars of
assets. But the priority on it this time from the highest
leadership means the stakes riding on success are tremendous.
</P>
<P>
   As one defense analyst noted, ``The commitment is very strong,
certainly at the top levels, though it's a bit harder to say at
lower levels. When it starts impacting on people's livelihood,
jobs, houses _ when the military has to forgo part of their income
_ that's not easily done.''
</P>
<P>
   Jiang's success will depend largely on his ability to make up
lost monies that have gone to improving military living standards.
In China, where defense funding is a fraction of that in the United
States, that will not be easy.
</P>
<P>
   With tentacles that reach into every aspect of life from power
stations and coal mines to frozen shrimp and karaoke bars, the PLA
is estimated to earn at least as much revenue annually _ about $10
billion _ as it officially gets from the state. PLA businesses
account for 3 percent of national output, about the same as a small
province in China.
</P>
<P>
   Ten percent of the nation's pharmaceutical industry is PLA-run,
including the popular 999 brand of herbal medicine, whose red neon
logo flashes over Hong Kong's harbor. Four of China's biggest
garment and shoemakers are PLA-owned. So are three professional
basketball teams and 1,500 hotels.
</P>
<P>
   But the profits from these ventures have lined not only the
coffers of an underfunded military, but also the pockets of some
officials and their families, making it likely that vested
interests will resist change.
</P>
<P>
   Some PLA units are accused of skimming revenues into private
bank accounts and pirating CDs and software. Others launder money,
trade on the black market, and run brothels. Smuggling alone has
cost the state $12 billion a year in lost revenue, according to
government figures.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang has accused PLA corruption of ``threatening to destroy our
socialist system.'' It is also bad for the military, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Illicit activities promote divisions within the armed forces,
dampen morale and distract from defense. They also damage
civil-military relations.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether Jiang, who irked the military last year
by keeping a general out of the ruling Politburo for the first
time, will have the stomach to go after high-ranking officers
involved in illegal activities. After the order to divest came on
July 22, rumors circulated in Beijing that threats were made
against Premier Zhu Rongji, who heads the unit ensuring the
military, police, courts and Communist Party shed their business
interests.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Beijing garrison announced it handed over its
68 military and police businesses to the city. Numerous ventures in
Shanghai, Guangzhou and elsewhere have been transferred. But
observers worry that select, high-profile handovers might
substitute for a wholesale shedding of assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's likely they won't do it all at once and that they won't
meet the deadline,'' said David Zweig, a China scholar at Hong Kong
University of Science and Technology. ``The PLA will do things that
are highly symbolic and visible, and the battle will continue as
the government weeds them out further and further from
non-essential businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   The PLA must shed commercial enterprises, but not industrial or
agricultural ones, so officials may try to play tricks with
reclassification.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Vice President Hu Jintao has said military businesses
``must close their doors completely and not in a disguised
manner,'' and has promised punishment and trials for those ``who do
not obey orders.'' Authorities are already investigating an aide to
a senior general in a securities scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main challenge is making sure the implementation actually
takes place,'' said Cheung, the military analyst. ``These companies
should be like any other company, but I think they'll continue to
have all sorts of privileges.''

NEWSPAPER CORRESPONDENT MISSING IN MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The Mexico City correspondent for the San Antonio
Express-News remained missing Monday more than two weeks after
setting out on a solo hiking trip through a wilderness area in
western Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Philip True, 50, who began the trip Nov. 29, hoped to photograph
and write about the region's Huichol Indians. True, who has been
the newspaper's correspondent in Mexico since January 1996, last
spoke with his wife on Nov. 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found several people who spoke with him Dec. 4, and we
believe we've narrowed the area where he could be,'' Manuel Obaya,
True's brother-in-law, said from Tepic, the capital of the state of
Nayarit.
</P>
<P>
   Marta True said her husband was tracing the route of the Huichol
Indians who inhabit a remote area of the Sierra Madre Occidental in
the states of Durango, Jalisco and Nayarit. She said True had been
expected to return home sometime last week.
</P>
<P>
   Obaya and a friend of True's rented a plane Sunday to fly along
the route the journalist was expected to take in the mountainous
area.
</P>
<P>
   Obaya said True was seen Dec. 1 at Tuxpan, Jalisco, and three
days later in Amoltilpa, also in Jalisco state.
</P>
<P>
   ``He appeared to be heading toward the Chapalagana Canyon, a
very remote area not easily accessible,'' Obaya said. ``He might be
injured, and we're very hopeful that he is trying to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the air search, Obaya said the state police in Jalisco
and Nayarit were conducting ground searches for True, an
experienced hiker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seriously concerned, but we remain optimistic that
Philip will be located in good health,'' said Robert Rivard, editor
of the San Antonio Express-News. ``He's an experienced hiker, but
it was foolish of him to attempt such an outing without a guide or
companion, and we can only hope he has lost the trail and will soon
be found.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Weigand, an American anthropologist who has lived and
worked in the region for more than two decades, said the region is
sparsely populated, is marked by deep canyons and historically has
been the scene of tension and occasional violence between cattle
ranchers and the region's indigenous people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the experience of government officials and foreigners in
Chiapas, sometimes foreigners are viewed as interlopers, and he
could have experienced a problem,'' he said. ``But the more likely
explanation is that he got lost in the Chapalagana Canyon and is
working his way out.''

A GOP EXERCISE IN MOB JUSTICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- At the moment of truth, the Impeachment Party has
served up the Mike Espy case in doubly disgusting form, repackaged
for a pseudo-Constitutional stage. That's the best light available
for an exercise in dumbed-down mob justice.
</P>
<P>
   More harshly, it's Andrew Johnson Lite, an attempt by one
political party to separate House impeachment from Senate trial and
removal from office, thus unconstitutionally shredding the Founding
Fathers' design for a double-barreled protection against abuse of
presidential powers.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment of truth, moving onto the House floor this week,
the Espy and Johnson Lite bastardizations of the constitution have
actually merged, illegally into an illegitimate hybrid.In public
now, the House's de facto leader, Majority Whip Tom DeLay of Texas,
can only arrange a tiny majority for impeachment by selling it to
undecided Republicans as something else.
</P>
<P>
   In the open, he and his allies are candidly calling impeachment
censure, transforming it from a constitutional protection of the
country into a partisan, punishment message.And in private, DeLay
and his allies are trying to arrange their tiny majority by telling
House members two even more constitutionally illegitimate tales:
</P>
<P>
   --You don't have to be convinced of President Clinton's guilt of
anything. You're simply the equivalent of a grand juror or inquest
participant looking for probable cause to ``send it to the Senate''
for trial. In flagrant contravention of the standards of the
Judiciary Committee chairman of Watergate fame, Peter Rodino,
current chairman Henry Hyde is DeLay's messenger.
</P>
<P>
   --There won't be any big trial in the Senate anyway, most likely
none at all. It will be halted somehow and either censure will
ensue there or your impeachment vote will stand as Clinton's
punishment. On a pseudo-constitutional stage, the ``prosecutors''
of the president are asserting that the ``indictment'' is in effect
punitive as opposed to accusatory. At least in the discredited case
against former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, the equally
discredited independent counsel, Donald Smaltz, had the sense to
withhold his extra-legal remarks until after he had lost the trial.
</P>
<P>
   But like the Espy case, this one depends upon a prosecutor's
narrative and theory that is unsupported by his own witnesses _
from Monica Lewinsky's concept of sex to Betty Currie's explicit
denial that she was pressured to say something false.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Starr and David Schippers could make headlines by telling
stories, spiced by selected quotes from uncross-examined grand jury
witnesses. But they cannot try the case in public, and Hyde can't
try the case before the Senate, because their witnesses contradict
each other and the prosecutors' theories.The only exception _
enshrined in first impeachment article _ would involve using Ms.
Lewinsky to allege sexual details her damaged credibility could
never establish in a normal trial.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Starr and Schippers used inference, narrative, and
invective to make cases their witnesses don't. That is why Hyde
contravened another Rodino principle from Watergate and called no
fact witnesses during his four-month process to resolve
contradictions and test the strength of contested grand jury
statements. That is why even the articles of impeachment on perjury
do not specify the actual statements considered perjurious, and
would be dismissed in a second for vagueness in a normal case.
</P>
<P>
   And that's where Andrew Johnson Lite comes to the rescue. One
hundred and 30 years ago, the radical Republicans of the post-Civil
War era set a policy as opposed to perjury trap for Lincoln's
successor; the House sprang it by voting his impeachment even
before they bothered to draft the articles.So rabidly partisan was
that bunch that they thought conviction by the Senate would be
equally preordained, but seven gutsy Republicans eventually stood
in the way.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the variation is that partisan impeachment by the House
can suffice and avoid the embarassment of failing to produce
credible evidence at a trial.
</P>
<P>
   As Representative Bill Delahunt, one of the few who has tried to
reach across party lines and is a leading censure player, put it,
the result is an extra-legal change in the Constitution to remake
``impeachment as a routine punishment for presidents who fall short
of our expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's more.
</P>
<P>
   Cowering under an expiring independent counsel law, the House
has abrogated its constitutional responsibility to exercise the
sole power of impeachment. It has simply received, publicized, and
rewritten the work of Starr, an employee of another branch.And its
leaders seek impeachment without proof of guilt on the expectation
that trial in the Senate can neither succeed nor is even likely to
occur.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny margin in favor that might be arranged next week will
be more than covered by the number of pro-impeachment Republicans
who will be replaced by anti-impeachment Democrats in a matter of
days.If that isn't illegitimate, the word has no meaning. At the
moment of truth, the punishment will become, not fit, the alleged
crime.

JEWS DEBATE MEANING OF HANUKKAH IN AGE OF COMMERCIALISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VENISE WAGNER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ On the scale of importance, Hanukkah is a Jewish
holiday that ranks with Purim _ far below Passover, Rosh Hashana
and Yom Kippur. But don't tell David Eiland, co-owner of Just For
Fun.
</P>
<P>
   Eiland, who grew up in a mixed-faith family (his grandfather was
a rabbi), is bursting with enthusiasm about this eight-day
celebration, which started Sunday at sundown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing with Hanukkah is it's a festive holiday,''
Eiland said with a giant grin. ``It has also become a gift-giving
holiday.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are plenty of goodies to get you in the Hanukkah
spirit, let alone put on your wish list: Hanukkah cards, 3-D
glasses that turn any Christmas light into a dreidel or Star of
David, banners, menorah snow globes, Jewish Holiday Rummy,
stickers, stamps, Curious George musical menorahs as well as
handcrafted classical versions.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are dreidels of every kind. Dreidels suspended in
soap; dreidels that light up and play the ``Dreidel'' song as they
spin; Mickey Mouse dreidels and pinata dreidels.
</P>
<P>
   The Festival of Lights is even going mainstream, as evidenced by
the small selection of menorahs available in Macy's Holiday Lane.
</P>
<P>
   Merchants of Hanukkah items have noticed an increase in demand
over the last five years. Eiland believes that much of the
commercial popularity stems from the contagious buying frenzy that
takes place around this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   The sales, the advertisements, the dazzle and sparkle are
attractive and hard to resist, as they tug and entice the senses.
People get into it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As if it's not bad enough that Christmas is marked by the number
of shopping days left rather than its spiritual significance, some
fear the growing consumer fervor for Hanukkah could make it
increasingly susceptible to commercial influences.
</P>
<P>
   ``The holiday season is the time when Jews realize they are not
part of the mainstream culture,'' said Rabbi Stephen S. Pearce of
Temple Emanu-El in San Francisco. ``So they are trying to
compensate by competing. Something that was originally a minor
holiday has been elevated to the same level of significant holidays
like Rosh Hashana, Yom Kippur and Passover.''
</P>
<P>
   While there is concern that the trend could prove detrimental to
religious integrity, Eiland is unfazed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting commercialized, but it's fun and tasteful,'' he
said. ``I look at it differently. There are so many mixed
marriages. So kids don't lose sight of their heritage, (adults)
have to make it fun to learn what the holiday traditions are.''
</P>
<P>
   The gifts are often educational and focus on one aspect of the
Hanukkah story, he said, so it's an opportunity to pass on the
tradition and the culture.
</P>
<P>
   The post-biblical story of the revolt of the Maccabees under
Hellenist oppression is filled with messages of freedom, hope,
miracles and righteousness overcoming domination.
</P>
<P>
   When the Maccabees returned victorious to their defiled temple
in Jerusalem, they found only one vial of oil to rekindle the
eternal flame. With so little oil, the flame should have burned for
no more than a day. But it burned for eight. Hanukkah is the
festival that celebrates the rededication of the temple.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Bashevkin, director of finance and administration at the
Jewish Museum in San Francisco, said the Jewish tradition is full
of such tales that strengthen Jewish identity, particularly when
everyone is assaulted with Christmas advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because it's a minor holiday doesn't mean it's lost on
the radar,'' Bashevkin said. ``There are some great lessons that
are behind the holiday.''

<P>
   Rabbi Howard Zack, of the orthodox Congregation Beth Jacob in
Oakland, Calif., struggles with the December dilemma. On the one
hand, he does not approve of people seeking meaning or their
identity in consumer goods. At the same time, he understands the
difficulty of fighting the tug to the cash register.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm somewhat conflicted,'' he said. ``As a minority culture
and a minority that has chosen in large part to assimilate in the
culture, when you see Jewish symbols (in store windows) you can't
help but be drawn toward that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate we have to turn toward the malls and gift
stores to find our Jewishness. Those who find it there will find
something less meaningful. The fact of the matter is Hanukkah can't
hold a candle to Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to make Hanukkah into a Jewish Christmas is one of Rabbi
Mark Diamond's pet peeves. The extravagant gift-giving that some
families feel pressed to do is inappropriate, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be the Grinch who stole Hanukkah,'' said
Diamond, of the conservative congregation Beth Abraham in Oakland.
``But it troubles me. Hanukkah is a beautiful holiday. It's a
beautiful custom. You have a holiday that celebrates the light, in
a dark and depressing time of year. But I fear it's going in the
way of Christmas in terms of presents.''

THE DURABLE PRESIDENT: TARGET AND TOTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN 
 &HT;     c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Eleven months ago, Newt Gingrich was revving up for
a presidential campaign, the Republicans were hoping to win two or
three dozen more seats in the House and reach 60 seats in the
Senate, and Bill Clinton was in the most serious peril of any
president since Richard M. Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the impeachment vote only days away on the House
floor, and the outcome too close to call, Gingrich has all but
disappeared, the Republicans are nursing their wounds from a
historically bad performance in midterm elections, and a president
who has acknowledged, as he did again Friday, ``my own
wrongdoing,'' retains the unambiguous strong support of the
American people.
</P>
<P>
   Most remarkable is this: Even if the House votes for impeachment
_ damaging the president in the history books and linking him
forever with Andrew Johnson, the only other president to suffer
that ignominy _ Clinton's profile in the capital may well be
unchanged. Clinton's storied durability is proving greater than
anyone imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton might disappoint us, offend us, even enrage us, but
in the end, there's something about him that beguiles us,
entertains us, engages us, even comforts and pleases us. And it
fascinates us.
</P>
<P>
   Some inscrutable twist of taste and fate _ and acts of will by
him and the voters _ has placed Clinton in the White House and kept
him there, in good standing even with the public who didn't vote
for him. Never mind that he's been accused of breaking the law,
charged with immorality, blamed for diminishing the office,
portrayed as a poor role model, and called a betrayer of his family
and country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Face-to-face or in a group, this man connects, even with
people who are prepared not to like him,'' says US Representative
John Tierney, the Massachusetts Democrat. ``Something happens,
whether in person or on television, that makes him seem compelling.
Somehow he makes people think that he's like them.''
</P>
<P>
   A cartoon character in the current New Yorker magazine says of
the president: ``He's an idiot and a sleazeball but I still like
him.'' A Fox News/Opinion Dynamics Poll this month found that half
the public believes the Monica Lewinsky scandal has hurt Clinton's
ability to lead the country _ but it also found that seven
Americans out of 10 approve of the job he's doing.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes commentators look down their noses and say we get the
president we deserve. This time, despite what the pundits' noses
tell us, we have the president we want.
</P>
<P>
   We have, after all, had both occasion and excuse to change
horses. But if after Gennifer Flowers, Paula Jones, ``inappropriate
intimate contact'' with intern Lewinsky, deliberate deception of
the press and public, systematic resistance to investigators'
inquiries, dependence on awkward legalisms (the definition of
``sexual relations''), ingenious verbal contortions (the definition
of ``is''), and a parade of incidents involving cigars, breath
mints, treacly gifts, and hallway trysts _ if after all that, we
are sticking with him, then it is clear that the bond between
president and public is nothing ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has something, a special rapport that allows him to
convince the American people that he empathizes with them,'' says
Robert Gilbert, a Northeastern University political scientist.
``You watch him in a public event and he rushes into the audience,
convincing them that he's part of them, that he feels for them. Now
they feel for him.''
</P>
<P>
   American presidents are like abstract paintings, summoning
emotions in the public that they didn't even know they had,
permitting people to see what they want in the brush strokes of a
public life, awakening responses that can be personal, political,
sensual.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my district, there is a group that never felt this way
about Jimmy Carter or Kennedy _ sane, rational, businesslike people
who do not trust this guy or who hate him,'' says Representative
Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican. ``But there is also a large group
that thinks that he is Everyman _ someone with frailties but who
touches a chord. He is likable, he is a charmer, and he is
charming.''
</P>
<P>
   All that, plus a charmed life.
</P>
<P>
   But not the sort of charmed life that came with privilege and
luck. Born to a single mother (his father died in a highway
accident before he was born), reared in modest circumstances,
nurtured by a grandfather and by friends who, even in his youth,
recognized his capacity for remarkable achievement, Clinton was
always a striver. The parents of the youngsters in his circle in
Hot Springs, Ark., spoke openly of the possibility that Bill
Clinton might be president someday.
</P>
<P>
   He chose John F. Kennedy as a hero and model and then maneuvered
to be photographed with him at Boys Nation; he selected Georgetown
University because it was in Washington, where the political action
was; he set his cap for a Rhodes Scholarship because he knew it was
an emblem of the new credentialism; he angled to avoid the draft
but worked just as deftly to retain what he called his ``political
viability''; he set out to win a House seat in his 20s, was
defeated, won election first as attorney general, and then as a
boy-wonder governor.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the keys to his success _ indeed, one of the keys to
his appeal _ is that none of it was easy. In fact, it is possible
to define Clinton by his failures: his failure to win reelection
after a term as governor, which made him the youngest ex-governor
in American history, but also made him older and wiser; his failure
to translate his idealism into an efficient governing style, which
prompted commentators to declare his presidency a failure even
before his 100-day honeymoon was over; his failure to take a
lifetime of policy thinking and planning and put those ideas into
law, which left his health insurance plan in a shambles and
transformed the president from a Great Proposer (sweeping proposals
and visionary ideas) into a Great Suggester (How about school
uniforms?).
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's six years have been remarkably full of tumult for a
peacetime president: A national debate on the health insurance
issue followed by the spectacular collapse of the president's plan.
Mini-dramas on several important Senate confirmation fights. The
specter of the budget deficit miraculously replaced by the
opportunity of the budget surplus. The rise, fall, and rise again
of power-partner Hillary Rodham Clinton. The dalliance with an
intern, the insistent denials, the inevitable revelations, the
angry fallout, the exhaustive investigation, the exhausting
impeachment debate.
</P>
<P>
   And yet none of those astonishing things was especially
startling.
</P>
<P>
   We knew he was a dreamer, and changing the country's system of
health insurance was a pie-in-the-sky dream. We knew he was an
angler, and so it was no surprise when the man who maneuevered to
avoid the draft also maneuevered to avoid the truth. We knew he was
a ladies' man, and so the sex stories that bubbled around
Washington were no surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``In politics you can get away with anything as long as it's
what's expected,'' says Representative Mark Sanford, a Republican
from South Carolina. ``If people expect you to be a rascal, you can
be a rascal. That he is a rascal has been discounted. But he is
also an engaging personality _ and things can't get better than
this in the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   In Clinton campaign headquarters in 1992, somebody scrawled the
now-famous epigram: ``It's the economy, stupid.'' It was the
economy that propelled Clinton into the White House over an
incumbent President Bush six years ago, and it may be the economy
that keeps Clinton in the White House now. But it's not only the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the president's appeal, to be sure, is, as
Representative Portman says, that touch of Everyman. And like other
presidents who touched their countrymen's imaginations, Clinton is
more a part of the people than apart from the people. The
Fox/Opinion Dynamics Poll, for example, shows that only 16 percent
of Americans polled believe the president is responsible for the
decline in moral standards in the country. Fully 50 percent believe
he is symbolic of that decline.
</P>
<P>
   So, though Clinton may have stumbled more than any president in
the postwar period, the more important thing is that he has picked
himself up, recovered, and fought back more than any other
president. Americans admire that in presidents and athletes and,
more to the point, they admire that in themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Americans like Clinton because he reminds us of
ourselves _ not necessarily the better angels of our nature, as
Lincoln told us, but our true nature, as Clinton showed us.

THESE TOYS RUN ON IMAGINATION, NOT MICROCHIPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL LOPEZ  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST GALWAY, N.Y. _ There is the interactive world of Furby,
Tigger and Barney, all talking, purring and bouncing in the ersatz
snow of the mall, and then there is Woody Herman's toy shop.
</P>
<P>
   Far from this modern toy landscape, Herman's shop is in a chilly
barn, where, from scraps of fine wood mainly used in his
furniture-making, Herman churns out hundreds of wooden trains, race
cars, trucks and helicopters. No patterns or production demands
dictate how Herman makes a toy.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, in a rough block of black walnut that was once part of a
pallet, Herman sees a dragster, regardless of the ant holes. Wood
in hand, he asks, ``That's a race car, right there, do you see
it?'' After deftly buzzing the wood through a band saw, the flowing
cuts exposing the streaked grain, Herman in minutes, and by eye,
has fashioned the car.
</P>
<P>
   Herman's final products, sanded smooth and rubbed with non-toxic
mineral oil to a warm glow, are inviting to the touch. Their
planes, like the Shaker-inspired furniture he makes, are pleasing
to the eye.
</P>
<P>
   Do not underestimate the power of the simple toy.
</P>
<P>
   Herman remembers one peculiar craft show about 10 years ago at
the state Capitol complex in Albany. ``I had people in three-piece
suits, the governor's staff, assemblymen and senators, down on the
ground, zooming their cars,'' Herman said.
</P>
<P>
   Herman, 52, a Vietnam War veteran who teaches woodworking for
special education students in suburban Albany, never set out to be
a toymaker.
</P>
<P>
   Toymaking, though, has taken over. He began making them 22 years
ago, to make use of scrap he couldn't bear to throw away. ``I laugh
because people know me as a toymaker or a birdhouse maker. Now, if
you want a piece of furniture, you have to wait three or four
years.'' He uses the profits to support his two daughters' college
educations.
</P>
<P>
   Wooden toys date to colonial America. Though the advent of cast
iron and tin toys, and then later, plastic largely replaced the
wooden toy, Herman said some families continued the homemade toy
tradition. About 15 years ago, the nostalgic interest of
trend-setting baby boomers spurred a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   In a backroom of his 19th-century home in rural upstate New York
are the prolific results of his craft. This room, ``The Country
Shop,'' bears a faint resemblance to Christmas cards and cartoons
that have long depicted Santa and his elves, cobbling wooden trains
together.
</P>
<P>
   In one laundry basket are $3.50 helicopters and planes, made of
oak, but enhanced by tiger maple or cherry blades. His $4
paddleboat, with a cherry paddle that propels the boat across
bathtub waters, is a replica of a 19th-century Mississippi River
toy.
</P>
<P>
   His flatbed trucks carry small cars that fit precisely on pegs.
Some of these cars have a previous life: one came from a scrap of
mahogany flooring; another, with a minivan shape, from the curly
cherry hutch he had made for a customer.
</P>
<P>
   Herman _ whose name, ``Woody,'' is taken from the big band
leader, not his avocation _ believes these toys hold their own
against the electronic world. A video game of a racing car does all
of the work, he notes. But with a wooden car in hand, ``you can
take that car and go, `zoom, zoom' and you can go 300 mph.''
</P>
<P>
   The simplicity, he believes, invokes the basic elements of play.
``Imagination is the word,'' Herman said.

KEATON HUMOR FAILS TO SPICE THE HOLIDAY TREACLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
JACK FROST 
Directed by: Troy Miller 
Written by: Mark Steven Johnson, Steve Bloom, Jonathan Roberts, and
Jeff Cesario 
Starring: Michael Keaton, Kelly Preston, Joseph Cross, Mark Addy,
Henry Rollins 
Running time: 100 minutes 
Rated: PG (some profanity, death of a parent) 
Stars: !! 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   These days, it seems every new holiday film is vying for the
classic status of ``It's a Wonderful Life,'' or more recently, ``A
Christmas Story.'' But somewhere along the way, heartwarming
sentiment has been replaced by teary treacle, which doesn't so much
warm the heart as make your molars ache from all the sweetener.
Such is the case with ``Jack Frost,'' a bit of holiday piffle
starring Michael Keaton as a man who gets a second chance, of
sorts, to be a good father to his son.
</P>
<P>
   Keaton's Jack is basically a decent guy, living in Colorado. He
loves his wife, Gabby (Kelly Preston), and his son, Charlie, and he
sorely regrets just how much he neglects them in pursuit of rock
'n' roll glory. Jack's the Springsteen-esque leader of a band, and
Keaton immerses himself in the complete catalog of rock god moves.
Jack and the band have been working hard for years, and it seems as
if their big break is finally about to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jack just hates the toll his life on the road has taken
on his family. One night, after building a snowman with Charlie,
Jack gives his son a harmonica, and this hokey promise: ``Whenever
you play this, no matter where I am, I can hear it.'' On Christmas
Eve, Jack has an audition with industry bigwigs, but on his way to
the meeting, he has a change of heart, deciding home is where he
needs to be. Bad move. On his way to the family's cabin, Jack is
killed in an auto accident.
</P>
<P>
   Now director Troy Miller and his merry band of writers don't
want to get all bogged down in all that nasty grief and mourning,
so the story fast-forwards one year. Charlie still misses his dad,
and remembering the experience they shared, he builds a snowman
that he dresses in his father's hat and scarf. And, of course, when
he plays that ol' magic mouth organ his dad gave him, the snowman,
with Keaton's voice, comes to animated life.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, there's something to hearing Keaton's snide voice
coming out of the sweet-faced snowman, and there are a few jokes
worth a guilty giggle, but those vague amusements can carry the
film only so far. Certainly, there are moments that will delight
kids (well, very small kids, anyway), such as when Snowman Jack
plays hockey, and fast-flying pucks slice painlessly through his
midsection. The special effects, created by Jim Henson's Creature
Shop, almost save the film, but they, too, are overwhelmed by the
sorts of homespun homilies we've heard hundreds of times before,
and seen in dozens of better movies.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the most amazing thing about ``Jack Frost'' may be that
it took four writers to come up with a film as insubstantial as
tinsel and as leaden as fruitcake. Then again, perhaps none of the
writers wanted to bear the blame alone.

<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ A 20-pound, 50-year-old Standard typewriter
coddled in his lap, Justin Lopes gingerly lifted keys to clean the
mechanical dinosaur as if they were the fingers of a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``An old typewriter provides the rhythm that makes thinking
easier,'' explained Lopes, the one-man service department at
University Typewriter and Computers Inc.
</P>
<P>
   He paused, stymied by a half-century of stubborn gunk caked on a
joint of the K key, then dabbed an extra dose of pungent-smelling
cleaning solvent on the mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computer boxes have come to do all the thinking now. Such a
shame,'' Lopes said, massaging the letter with a swatch of cloth. A
moment passed, K fluttered to life, and Lopes, with just a hint of
a smile, moved on to L.
</P>
<P>
   The progress is incremental and the rewards are modest when
you're in the business of fixing what most folks throw out. Then
again, repairing the arcane isn't for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure I see myself as a fixer,'' said Elaine Steward,
who specializes in the repair of dolls at the Elane Doll Co. in
Woburn. ``I think of myself more as a savior of dreams and some of
the memories we all like to hold on to.''
</P>
<P>
   These fixers are, for the most part, an elusive lot who
advertise by word of mouth and work in back rooms where walls are
decorated with neatly organized tools once owned by grandparents.
Their shop music is usually classicial, their hours unpredictable,
their prices reasonable, and their nemesis a throw-away culture
that bottoms out this time of year as advertisers exhort holiday
shoppers to buy new, new, new.
</P>
<P>
   And thus they are also a dwindling lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm unaware of too many people left in this line of work,''
said Lewis Hurxthal Jr., who repairs yacht compasses and sextants
from a shop on Commercial Wharf in Boston. He had just gotten off
the phone with a Danish sailor calling from Greenland with a broken
compass and an unspoken compliment that when you're good, your name
gets around.
</P>
<P>
   One of the perks of the job ``is just working with this mystical
force of magnetism,'' Hurxthal said.
</P>
<P>
   Dorchester has an expert drapery spot remover; Sudbury has a
furniture paint technician who doesn't need (or use) charts to
match colors; Salem has a model ship restorer; and Wayland has
Michael Poisson, who for 30 years has put the tock back in old
clocks using tools inherited from his father and grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I get the feeling because of our junk-it society
that I'm one of the last businesses of this sort on earth,'' said
Poisson, who claims a good clock tuneup lasts 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Name me one other item _ just one other item! _ in a household
that, treated well, will operate 24 hours a day for 20 years
without a service job,'' said Poisson.
</P>
<P>
   These fixers are also a passionate lot, as evidenced by visits
to a few closet repair shops where it sometimes seemed the
commodity that healed best was time.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, Steward's doll infirmary appears to be a
collection of naked, miniature body parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men dropping off a broken doll for their daughter or wife tend
to find this scene somewhat disturbing,'' Steward said of the
remnants around her. ``Women usually talk to their dolls and remind
them that they're going to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Steward's average ``patient'' is 30 years old, with a stay
running perhaps a week or more. The bill is about $100 for the
interior re-stringing, hair transplant, and exterior makeover that
give a doll that prime-of-life glow.
</P>
<P>
   The average stay for a typewriter in Lopes's ``service
department'' is one month, where machines come in looking like
faded props from a black-and-white movie. His department measures 5
by 10 feet, the walls so cluttered with tools and repair manuals
that the only place available for the 38-year-old technician to
tape pictures of his family is on the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Born in the Azores, Lopes was a tinkerer by the time he was 5
years old. He started repair work here in 1992, where restoring the
1,000-plus parts of an old Underwood typewriter seemed a logical
extension of the radios he disassembled _ and sometimes patched
together again _ during his youth.
</P>
<P>
   Not all these fixers have roots in the trade. Consider Hurxthal,
whose shop is located at Robert E. White Instruments Inc., a
company that once made compasses. Hurxthal, 69, got his training
studying the breeding habits of ostriches in Kenya for a doctorate
in zoology.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a reach, but there is a connection,'' said Hurxthal, a
Plymouth resident. ``Once you learn how to repair a Land Rover in
the bush, a compass is no big deal.''

VERDICT FROM WOMEN: IMPEACH LINDA TRIPP 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Because she is the coauthor of a best-selling
book about women's friendships, people ask Tamara Traeder what she
thinks of Linda Tripp and her secret phone tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When that news got out, you could hear women gasp all over
America,'' Traeder said. ``It was and still is a hair-raising
thought: your trusted friend taping your phone conversations. Most
women consider their girlfriend relationships as sacred as a
confessional.''
</P>
<P>
   Traeder and her coauthor, Carmen Renee Berry, have learned a lot
about women's values since ``Girlfriends'' (Wildcat Canyon Press),
quietly invaded female America in 1995. Now in its 27th printing,
the paperback just passed the one-million-books mark and has
spawned ``The Girlfriends Keepsake Book'' as well as a sequel,
``Girlfriends For Life,'' which will be published this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing you never know as a publisher _ unless you're
producing someone like Tom Clancy _ is what book will take off,''
said Roy Carlisle, of Wildcat Canyon's mother ship, Circulus
Publishing Group Inc. in Berkeley, Calif. ``Books that do become
really big sellers always articulate some very powerful feeling
that is right below the surface of the culture, something not quite
in the consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``That pretty clearly is what happened with `Girlfriends.' This
thing of women's deep friendships is not a kind of fad; it's a
serious reality for women in this culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Before they collaborated on their book of essays, interviews and
featured quotations, Traeder and Berry ``thought they were
special'' because of the high quality of their female friendships.
Both women had been through periods of crisis, loss and change in
the early '90s and believed they might not have survived without
the love, understanding and support of their closest
``girlfriends.''
</P>
<P>
   Doing the book _ and riding its amazing wave of success _ has
shown the authors that they are not at all unique.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost every woman has at least one woman she feels this way
about: She's my support; she doesn't judge me; she's always there
for me; I trust her completely; I tell her everything,'' Traeder
said. ``The letters we've received about the first book just amazed
us. That's why we decided to do `Girlfriends For Life.' People have
written tomes, some five and six pages long, about their
friendships. They're really quite moving.''
</P>
<P>
   Divided into dozens of mini-chapters such as, ``She's As Crazy
As I Am'' and ``Helping Us Change (Even When We'd Rather Not),''
``Girlfriends'' is not a deep book. But it is as wide as the sea
and just as accessible. Reading anecdotes from other women tends to
start a recall-and-analysis process for even the casual peruser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere we go, women keep thanking us for making them think
about their friendships and see how blessed they are to have
them,'' Traeder said.
</P>
<P>
   Why, given the significance of our female friendships, has so
little attention been paid them?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's because they're usually such easy
relationships,'' Traeder said. ``We tend to focus our attention and
energy on relationships that are more trouble _ the ones with men,
our families, our kids, our co-workers. When something goes wrong
with a girlfriend, it's rare and it's really bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Something like when your girlfriend secretly tapes your most
intimate phone conversations, then turns them over to the feds?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine how Monica Lewinsky could ever reconnect or
put herself out there again to trust,'' Traeder said. ``For many
women, their girlfriends are the healers, the people who help them
recover from life's blows, from dramatic changes and problems and
bad relationships. And Linda Tripp wasn't just a girlfriend, she
was a mentor, an older woman Monica looked to for help and
advice.''
</P>
<P>
   As Traeder and Berry wrote in ``Girlfriends'' in 1995: ``By
telling our stories, we learn about relationships. These stories
tell us how to treat each other _ what is acceptable, what is
honorable and what is not ... With our girlfriends we peel back
many layers of our personalities. This process is an intimate and,
we believe, sacred undertaking. Anyone who has shown that
willingness to expose their darkest secrets or greatest fears to
another woman understands the treasure of a trusted girlfriend.''
</P>
<P>
   And anyone who violates that sacred undertaking ought to be
impeached _ from the human race.

COMPASSION SHOULD BE A YEAR-ROUND GIFT 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VERONICA FLORES  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ It was Christmas Eve last year when a man
approached me as I filled my car's gas tank. Out of a job, he said
he was failing at finding one that week because many of those in
positions to do the hiring already were gone for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   He asked for money, not for himself, he insisted, but for his
9-year-old daughter to have enough to eat.
</P>
<P>
   The cynic in me immediately wanted to harden against this man. I
wondered whether he really had a daughter who needed to eat. So
instead of money, I offered to buy the man and his daughter a meal
at the fast-food place across the street. He accepted, though he
protested I was spending far more than the few dollars he'd asked
for in the first place _ he reasoned he could have bought a whole
chicken and stretched it beyond one meal.
</P>
<P>
   We talked. He told me his name was Earl. His little girl was
Tanya. We shook hands.
</P>
<P>
   When we got the food order, I also gave him a few treats I had
in the car _ baked goods and a gift left over from a party for
needy children. Earl thanked me profusely, so much so that I was
embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   I mention my encounter with Earl because of a conversation I had
the other day with Jon Hinojosa, the head of an arts program for
urban youth in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   He complimented my home newspaper's holiday series spotlighting
nonprofit agencies, but commented that the newspaper makes such an
effort only once a year.
</P>
<P>
   That's not unlike most communities, where the period between
Thanksgiving and Christmas has become, for better or worse, the
``season of giving.'' It is a time when we celebrate our good
fortune, the rationale goes, and many thus feel compelled to share
it with others.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the hungry and homeless appreciate the attention,
but, as Hinojosa notes, they await the donation drought that is
just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   It's as if hearts _ and pockets _ have been conditioned to open
only once a year. Who says it has to stop there?
</P>
<P>
   The hunger of the poor and homeless is a year-round crisis. Some
social workers observe that the needs of such a population are so
daunting, cynicism can overtake.
</P>
<P>
   They call the phenomenon ``compassion fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
   I'll admit I was nearing that point before I gave in to the
thought of Earl's daughter going hungry on Christmas Eve. But the
gift of thanks I received in return sparked my compassion anew.
</P>
<P>
   I pledged to Hinojosa that I would call for a ``Christmas in
July'' next summer. He's promised to keep me honest. But he may not
have to do any nudging. I welcome another chance to get that warm,
fuzzy feeling from helping others, even if it comes in the heat of
July.

VODKA BRAND GIVES PETS A HELPING HAND

   One of the more peculiar pairings we've encountered lately is
between Grey Goose Vodka and the American Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
</P>
<P>
   The spirit brand, introduced in this country last year, gives 1
percent of profits to the ASPCA. The holiday marketing campaign
(with its adorable photo) stretches amusingly to convey its message
about how ideal booze is as a present, while pets are less of a
best bet.
</P>
<P>
   According to a news release, ``Grey Goose Vodka is a great gift,
(but) the ASPCA reminds the public that surprising someone with a
puppy or kitten under the Christmas tree can be a recipe for
disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider all the ramifications and responsibilities before
giving a pet, the ASPCA warns, or the society will have another
abandoned critter on its hands.

   TASTY BUGS: In a publication called the Nutrition Action
Healthletter, we find some alarming information about the
primary-colored beverage Fruitopia, a product of the Coca-Cola Co.
Although the label boasts Fruitopia to be a ``real fruit
beverage,'' it has only the equivalent of two to four tablespoons
of fruit juice per 20-ounce bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Each bottle contains 275 calories and 17 to 19 teaspoons of
added sugar. Also in Fruitopia is an additive called cochineal, a
red dye made from the pulverized bodies of insects that has caused
severe allergic reactions in some people. It's in at least four
flavors of Fruitopia.
</P>
<P>
   The $24-a-year Healthletter is published by the Center for
Science in the Public Interest, a group known for attacking food of
dubious nutritional value. Subscribe by writing to CSPI, Suite 300,

   LICKED CLEAN: In the mail we find a product called etc, the
Electric Tongue Cleaner, made by Oralgiene.
</P>
<P>
   It's exactly that: a vibrating base and a curved plastic blade.
Scrape the buzzing thing across your tongue to reduce foul-smelling
exhalations by 85 percent, according to Oralgiene. Brushing your
tongue flattens bacteria into crevices instead of scraping them
away with 8,000 vibrations per second.
</P>
<P>
   I tried the device for a couple of weeks; it's surely the
strangest thing I've ever put into my mouth, and the process rather
feels like I'm mowing my tongue. Nobody ever complained about my
breath before (which may mean only that we have polite friends),
nor has anyone said it now smells sweeter.
</P>
<P>
   Find the $30 etc at Brookstone stores or order directly by
calling 800-933-ORAL (6725).

   BAYINDIR, Turkey _ The great coin discovery of the century
happened almost by chance, rising out of a muddy field to the
shouts of three men who simply thought they struck gold.
</P>
<P>
   Chasing the whir of a hand-held metal detector, three peasants
had rushed to dig a hole, kneeling in soil still wet with rain.
When hundreds of shining pieces began to appear, overflowing from a
jar lodged in the earth, they jumped up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are rich!'' yelled Ibrahim Basbug. ``We are rich!''
</P>
<P>
   It was, for a brief moment on April 18, 1984, a modern
leprechaun tale. But almost as quickly as the peasants could stuff
the coins into paper bags, exhuming Athenian decadrachms buried
more than 2,000 years earlier, an epic saga with remarkable twists
was beginning to unfold.
</P>
<P>
   In the years that followed _ as the silver slipped out of
Turkey, allegedly into the hands of smugglers and US collectors _
it would prompt a lawsuit in Boston federal court, entangling two
Harvard classmates and an eccentric billionaire, William I. Koch.
Academics would wring their hands over the fate of one the world's
premiere antiquities finds. The peasants would go to jail.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, as two sides prepare for a trial that pits the
Republic of Turkey against the owners of the disputed coins, a
moral dilemma persists: Who has a rightful claim to such rare
vestiges of the past?
</P>
<P>
   In the shadows of the controversy is the Boston Museum of Fine
Arts, where the disputed coins were authenticated. A year ago, on
another antiquities issue, the MFA came under fire for acquiring
pre-Columbian artifacts, despite evidence they were illegally
smuggled out of Guatemala. Cornelius C. Vermeule III, curator of
the MFA's classical art department for four decades until his
retirement in 1996, encouraged Koch to buy the coins. Even after
Vermeule received a warning that Turkish authorities were looking
for plundered coins, he continued to reassure Koch that his
purchase would give ``no cause for regret.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, the coins are locked in a Florida bank vault held by
Koch, an investor best known for his family's $35 billion oil
company and his 1992 America's Cup win. Rarely shy of a good court
brawl _ he once took his mistress, Catherine de Castelbajac, to
Boston housing court to evict her from his Four Seasons penthouse,
and last summer sued his own brothers for $2 billion of the family
share _ Koch has shown no interest in returning the treasure out of
good will.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does he see a need to. Along with Jonathan H. Kagan and
Jeffrey Spier _ friends from Harvard and co-partners in OKS, the
corporation that bought the coins _ Koch says he acted in good
faith in 1984. Furthermore, Koch added in a statement provided to
the Globe last week, his is an entirely different hoard _ not the
so-called ``Elmali hoard'' plundered illegally that year.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish officials have amassed evidence to the contrary,
including correspondence from foreign experts and essays by Spier
himself. They present an apparently simple case: Although some 36
civilizations have occupied Turkish soil over time, the hoard is
part of the country's ``national heritage,'' which the United
States has agreed to respect since signing the 1970 UNESCO treaty
condemning illegal antiquities trades.
</P>
<P>
   But the international community has also suffered from the loss,
according to even those who would see the hoard sent back. Ozgen
Acar, a Turkish investigative journalist who helped break the
story, says the coins ``belong to all of humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This hoard is a very important part of a historic chain,''
Acar said, passionately describing the Greek battle victories that
might explain the coins' burial, presumably around 465 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ahmet Ali Senturk, a 68-year-old farmer from Bayindir, is one of
the three who discovered the coins after their 24-century
interment. Fourteen years later, Senturk is plagued by the
discovery, he said during an interview in his home. And he is
baffled by the amount Koch and his partners allegedly paid _
roughly $3 million for some 1,700 of the coins.
</P>
<P>
   Seated cross-legged on a faded cushion in his mud hut, Senturk
gazed out the window in silence. Donkeys bleated outside, and as
his wife, Huriye, served cups of yogurt milk, Senturk began to talk
about the find, which brought him $80 and a year in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that, if it was the same experience, I would leave them
in the ground,'' he said. ``I wouldn't touch it.''
</P>
<P>
   It started as a lark. Two local men, Bayram Sungur and Ibrahim
Basbug, had been scouring the fields with a metal detector for days
_ common sport in Anatolia, where piles of relics are unearthed
illegally every year. They were about to admit defeat when they
encountered Senturk on a village path. Senturk insisted they
demonstrate the gadget.
</P>
<P>
   They piled into Senturk's yellow Fiat _ the only car in the
500-resident town _ and drove down the hillside to an open farming
strip. Basbug got out and waved the machine in the direction of the
ground. It buzzed right away.

   Launched in 1995 amid tons of hype, and even more money, the
studio headed by filmmaker Steven Spielberg, former Disney
executive Jeffrey Katzenberg, and all-purpose mogul David Geffen
stumbled for its first few years with such big-screen misfires as
``The Peacemaker'' and ``Paulie.'' And despite generally positive
reviews, ``Amistad,'' Spielberg's fact-based slave ship epic, sank
at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, the much-scrutinized entertainment company seemed
to hit its stride. Its comet actioner, ``Deep Impact,'' was the
first hit of the summer, and the World War II movie was revived
with the harrowing ``Saving Private Ryan,'' a title sure to be
heard early and often when Academy Award nominations are announced
in February. Then the studio scored with its computer-animated
``Antz.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, DreamWorks unveils perhaps its most anticipated
project yet _ ``The Prince of Egypt.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on the oft-told story of Moses, the film features the
voices of Val Kilmer as Moses and Ralph Fiennes as Rameses, as
stepbrothers made foes by conflicting destinies. Other actors who
lent their voices to the production are Sandra Bullock, Jeff
Goldblum, Michelle Pfeiffer, Danny Glover, Patrick Stewart, Steve
Martin, Helen Mirren, and Martin Short. It is the studio's first
traditionally animated feature, and as such, takes direct aim at
Disney, Katzenberg's former employer with whom he had a very
acrimonious split.
</P>
<P>
   And if taking Disney on in a field it has dominated for seven
decades weren't daunting enough, consider this film's subject
matter. Derived from the Old Testament book of Exodus, it is the
story of a man chosen by God to deliver the Hebrews from bondage in
Egypt. There's the Slaughter of the Innocents, brutalized slaves,
and some pretty nasty plagues when the Almighty wants to prove He
means business. Hardly a kid's movie, this is not the sort of
frothy confection some have come to expect in their animated films.
That would seem to make the film a bit of a risk for DreamWorks.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Katzenberg, the film's executive producer, views the
challenge quite differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technique of animation has been used for 70 years to tell
fairy tales. I loved the fairy tales, and for years at Disney, I
loved doing it. But we wanted to try and do something different at
DreamWorks,'' he said recently during a New York trip with cast and
crew to promote the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I compare this to when Steven Spielberg, (director) Bob
Zemeckis, and I were involved in `Who Framed Roger Rabbit.' We told
people this would be different, with live action and animation, and
people would say, `Oh, `Pete's Dragon,' and we would say, `No, this
is something completely different.' To me, there is an unbelievably
rich opportunity to take this technique of animation, and tell
something other than a fairy tale.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood has visited this dramatic terrain before. In 1923,
Cecil B. DeMille, the legendary director who never met a biblical
epic he didn't like, made ``The Ten Commandments,'' a silent film
starring Theodore Roberts as Moses and Charles De Roche as Rameses,
the Egyptian king who opposed Moses' quest to free the Hebrews.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-three years later, DeMille remade his film as an
all-color, all-talking spectacular starring Charlton Heston as
Moses and Yul Brynner as the sexiest Rameses ever to don a skirt
and breastplate _ ``So shall it be written, so shall it be done!''
The Oscar-nominated film also starred Anne Baxter, Edward G.
Robinson, Vincent Price, and Dame Judith Anderson, and may well
have been a visual guideline for ``The Prince of Egypt.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that it was the only guideline for the filmmakers.
DreamWorks sought the counsel and advice of educators, biblical
scholars, Egyptologists, biblical archeologists, and religious
leaders including the Revs. Jesse Jackson, Jerry Falwell, Pat
Robertson, and Cecil Murray, and Rabbi Marvin Hier.
</P>
<P>
   Given the subject matter, the filmmakers were concerned about
historical accuracy, and even reverence for the source material.
One of the most difficult challenges was faced by lyricist Stephen
Schwartz, who wrote original songs for the film. His songs had to
be entertaining, but couldn't be too cute lest they undermine the
tale's seriousness. At one point there even were talking and
singing camels, but they didn't make the final cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bit of tightrope walk, so we kept going back to the
human story,'' said Schwartz, who has also worked on Disney's ``The
Hunchback of Notre Dame'' and ``Pocahontas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Early on the story was defined as a brother story, and as soon
as I heard that I seized on that,'' he said. ``This is the story of
two brothers who care deeply for one another, but their destinies
pull them apart until, at the end, they are literally separated by
an ocean. Coming back to the emotion and humanity of that story
helps you not worry too much about who you're offending.''
</P>
<P>
   But the film's composer, Hans Zimmer, acknowledged how precious
this story is to the devout and faithful. What is at stake, he
said, goes beyond upstart DreamWorks' fledgling reputation as an
animation titan to rival Disney.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us,'' he said, ``wants to become the Salman Rushdies
of the film business, having offended the majority of the world.''

GETTING PERSONAL WITH THE COMPUTER

   (itals)``I honestly think you ought to calm down; take a stress
pill and think things over.''(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   That is, as cult-film enthusiasts know, one of the most
memorable lines uttered by HAL 9000, the computer that goes berserk
in Stanley Kubrick's 1968 head-trip classic, ``2001: A Space
Odyssey.'' ``Calm down,'' HAL says in that distinctive disembodied
voice, a sort of mellow whine with a malevolent bite. ``Take a
stress pill,'' the dysfunctional computer advises, shortly before
suffering a system breakdown and threatening the mere humans who
brought him into operation one fine day in January 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Poor HAL and his compatriot computers, forever typecast as the
evil menace wreaking danger and destruction. In films ranging from
``Desk Set'' in 1957 to ``The Net'' in 1995, computers have been
characterized on the big screen as dark, sometimes apocalyptic
forces that instill paranoia and fear. Created and operated by
stereotypical programmers portrayed as emotionless bureaucrats,
misfits, or nerds, these huge machines are going to make us lose
our jobs, lose our wars, lose our freedom, lose our very
identities. The message has been clear: Pull the plug.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, that is. The computer has a new screen image _
perky, trim, and so user-friendly you can snuggle up with it in
bed. In ``You've Got Mail,'' the romantic comedy starring Tom Hanks
and Meg Ryan that opens Friday, the laptop computer is more than
just a benign communication tool. It comforts lonely hearts; it
brings unlikely lovers together; it makes folks who live small but
meaningful lives feel significant in the cosmos. It's the yenta of
the 21st century, an unparalleled matchmaker, a silicon chip with a
heart of gold. And the people who use it aren't calculating
scientists or adolescent hackers: They're America's sweethearts,
ordinary sorts harboring that &QC; 
timeless dream that their soul mate is out there, maybe just around
the corner.
</P>
<P>
   The blinking red eye of HAL has segued to the teary hazel eyes
of the adorable Meg Ryan, typing away on the keyboard and praying
for Mr. Right.
</P>
<P>
   And that's a good thing. ``Over the years, the computer has
played the heavy and the villain, but increasingly, we're going to
see the computer as less and less the evil bad guy,'' says
Christopher Morgan, a computer consultant and author of ``The
Official Computer Bowl Trivia Book.'' ``Over the last two decades,
people's impression of computers has changed, and certainly the
personal computer had a role in that. The mystique went away. The
idea that the computer was going to harm us has melted. Now, people
don't think twice about their computers doing good or evil. They're
just an integral part of life, like a car. I can't imagine a movie
about an evil car.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that long ago, it would have been hard to imagine a
children's movie about a friendly computer (HAL the debugged Love
Bug?), but that scenario doesn't seem too far-fetched today.
</P>
<P>
   As the technology has evolved and infiltrated everyday life, so
has the computer's screen image. In fact, the doomsday films of the
last few decades _ and even a few years ago _ seem hilarious today,
even to those without an engineer's sense of humor. It's hard not
to snicker when world leaders with grim faces and trim haircuts are
called in to oversee computer-generated crises in such films as
``Colossus: The Forbin Project'' (1970) and ``WarGames'' (1983).
After all, today President Clinton wants a computer in every
classroom and greets browsers cheerfully on the White House Web
site. HAL, we hardly knew ye.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've Got Mail,'' then, brings the computer image full circle
in more ways than one. Back in 1957, an ``electronic brain'' called
EMMY terrified office workers in ``Desk Set,'' a screwball comedy
starring Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. The computer itself _
a laughably inauthentic wall of steel and flashing lights, complete
with a Teletype machine _ was a thin plot device to get the
Hepburn-Tracy chemistry thing going. She runs a research office at
a television network, and he has been hired to improve office
efficiency. The researchers are convinced the computer is going to
make their jobs obsolete; they do all end up with pink slips, but
only as a result of a computer error made by the payroll
department. The important thing is that the stars get to battle
wits and acknowledge their attraction by the time the credits roll.
Boy gets girl, despite the computer.
</P>
<P>
   That will-they-ever-get-together theme is central to ``Mail,''
though the computer is now the conduit for love rather than the
obstacle. (Coincidentally, Henry and Phoebe Ephron wrote ``Desk
Set''; four decades later, their daughters, Nora and Delia Ephron,
penned the script for ``Mail,'' which Nora Ephron directed; see
accompanying story.) The male romantic lead has evolved, however.
In his usual frumpy fashion, Tracy played an eccentric MIT
graduate, a kind of antisocial character whose socks don't match
and who seems to idle away the time solving differential equations.
By contrast, Tom Hanks in ``Mail'' is, well, Tom Hanks, the
fresh-scrubbed hero who guided Apollo 13 back to earth safely.

   TAKE-BOS  
 UNDATED: ... to earth safely.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In its lighthearted, gentle way, ``Desk Set'' started the
tradition of the computer geek on-screen. The Space Age engineers
in ``2001'' are inscrutable, even when interrogated by HAL. (``What
are you doing, Dave?'') In ``Colossus,'' electronics wizard Charles
Forbin describes himself as ``an impartial, emotionless machine, a
paragon of reason.'' The college students in a 1970 Disney comedy
called ``The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes'' are lovable losers; in
the hit ``WarGames,'' an astonishingly young Matthew Broderick fits
all the criteria of the stereotypical hacker _ a brainy
underachiever who is estranged from his parents and has difficulty
communicating with his peers. Two programmers in ``WarGames'' are
quintessential geeks: One is a nasal-voiced nerd in a plaid shirt,
and the other is a volatile nutcase wearing a smily-face T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   The stereotype gets even more absurd in ``The Net,'' which casts
Sandra Bullock against type as a lonely software engineer who has
no friends, rarely leaves the house, and hasn't taken a vacation in
years. When evil computer mavericks steal her identity, she has
nowhere to turn. The film, which came out just around the time the
World Wide Web was emerging as the great new frontier for
nontechnical types, paints in the kind of paranoid shades that
colored movies during the Cold War. In this case, however, the
enemy isn't the abstract notion of communism: It's simply the
computer. In ``The Net,'' the computer isn't going to blow up the
world with one quick blast; it's going to do it slowly, eliminating
us one by one, erasing our identities as well as our humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock is up against evil manipulators who use the technology
maliciously; the people, not the machines themselves, are the
psychopaths who pull the trigger. But in films made during the Cold
War, computers are sentient things with the ability to learn and to
act on their own. In ``2001'' and ``WarGames,'' they can also play
a good game of chess, which shows what most people thought
computers could do in previous decades _ that is, play games and
destroy the universe.
</P>
<P>
   That fear stemmed from the belief that computers really were
electronic brains with the ability to think. For all its spacy
choreography, ``2001'' offers an astute psychological study of HAL,
who becomes maniacal only after his feelings get hurt. When he's
disconnected, he reverts to childhood in that creepy, classic
``death scene,'' singing ``Daisy'' as he remembers his youth.
Likewise, the computer in ``Colossus'' begins to act on its own and
establishes contact with its counterpart in the former Soviet
Union. The two machines communicate via neon messages scrolling
across a marquee; the machine orders military-style executions,
takes over the global defense system, and threatens to launch World
War III. Not bad for a big box with flashing lights. The looming
threat is that man will become a slave to the machine: ``Obey me
and live, or disobey me and die,'' the computer commands eerily.
</P>
<P>
   The apocalypse is also the underlying threat in ``WarGames,''
which starts out as a sort of ``Ferris Bueller's Day at the Video
Arcade'' and turns into a military thriller. After Broderick's
character inadvertently finds a ``back door'' into the Defense
Department's computer system, the machine starts acting on its own,
simulating an international conflict that could end in nuclear
destruction. Broderick's computer geek joins forces with a mad
scientist played by John Wood, whose darting eyes and nervous tics
make him seem a human version of HAL 9000.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but yesterday's madmen and misfits are today's millionaires.
In ``You've Got Mail,'' Tom Hanks is a perfectly sane, perfectly
handsome fellow who uses his personal computer to reach out and
e-mail his on-line buddy. Oh, he also happens to be a filthy-rich
scion of a bookselling empire, but in the film, that's just a
little plot device to get the two cyberpals together. Hanks's
character, Joe Fox, is opening a superstore around the corner from
Ryan's children's bookstore, appropriately called the Shop Around
the Corner (a nod to the title of the 1940 Ernst Lubitsch comedy
that ``You've Got Mail'' remakes). The two feud like competitors:
He represents big business swallowing up the mom-and-pop shops, and
she is a link to a simpler past, where human contact mattered. In
the meantime, Ryan and Hanks are doing a little flirting dance in
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   The computer here is just a part of everyday life, as routine
as, say, a toaster oven. The machine isn't evil; the people who use
it are regular folks. The film, a sort of cyberversion of
``Sleepless in Seattle,'' even has in-jokes about the computer
industry: A batty character played by Jean Stapleton announces that
she is rich, explaining, ``I bought Intel at $6.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, this isn't the first movie that presents computers as
benign: The machines in such film and television series as ``Star
Trek,'' ``Star Wars,'' ``Lost in Space,'' and ``The Jetsons''
certainly did more good than harm. But in ``Mail,'' the computer
actually brings people together, a fact that isn't lost on folks
who have been preaching about the potential of technology for
decades. ``I'm so pleased to see this type of movie come out,''
says computer consultant Morgan. ``I've been proselytizing about
computers for years, and now they've hit critical mass. They're a
very important part of society, and they're going to revolutionize
the way we live over the next 100 or 200 years. It's about time
movies started to reflect that.''
</P>
<P>
   And yes, ``You've Got Mail'' does just that. In the film, both
Hanks and Ryan are avid customers of America Online, the Internet
service provider and communication service that has 14 million
members. Whatever their differences in the flesh world _ he's the
corporate monolith swallowing up the competition, she is the
competition _ the romantic leads open windows to each other's souls
in the cyberworld. The computer is no longer the heavy; it's a
humanizing tool that enables two strangers who might unknowingly
pass each other at Starbucks to actually sit down over a tall decaf
latte.
</P>
<P>
   Without giving away the ending, let's just say computers are no
longer the evil menace. In fact, the movie asks: How were we ever
human without them?

 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A computer system that air traffic controllers rely on fails and
radar screens go blank. Error messages flash on computer screens.
Controllers scramble for pencil and paper and try to reconstruct
what was on their screens and plot where the planes were.
</P>
<P>
   Unknown to controllers, two jumbo jets with a total of 372
people on board are on a collision course six miles above the East
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the stuff of made-for-TV movies. It happened. Last
Sunday night. As the planes neared each other, computers on both
aircraft alerted crews to take evasive action to prevent a
collision. A midair disaster was averted.
</P>
<P>
   A week earlier, a similar incident occurred. Two planes came
within 300 feet of each other. This time, it was the on-board
computer system that brought the planes dangerously close together.
</P>
<P>
   There are more planes in the sky than at anytime in history, and
during the holiday season, those planes are filled with passengers.
Long-range forecasts call for more airplanes, more flights, and
even more crowded skies. It all makes one wonder: How safe is it to
fly?
</P>
<P>
   The simple answer is it is very safe _ for now.
</P>
<P>
   But there are signs that the air traffic control system is
strained to the breaking point, and the accident rate _ while still
very low _ has plateaued since the last big safety breakthrough of
reliable jet engines. If air traffic increases at expected rates,
and if new safety measures promised by officials are not taken _ or
fail to make the system safer _ experts say that within 20 years we
can expect an airline crash someplace in the world every eight to
10 days.
</P>
<P>
   But first, the good news for nervous holiday travelers: The risk
of being in a fatal airplane crash on a US commercial jet is about
one in 3 million. Overall, our safety systems work and work well;
just consider those two midair events. There were no collisions, no
one died. No one was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 1990s, about 5 billion people have flown on commercial
planes in US air space and the number of people killed has been
zero, so that should give us some perspective,'' says Arnold
Barnett, a statistician at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. ``With these two events, it was either a TCAS (the
on-board computer that warns pilots of approaching airplanes)
problem or an ATC (air traffic control) problem, but not both.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me you'd have to have a TCAS failure and an ATC
failure, and some very bad luck, to have a midair collision,'' he
said. ``So in some ways, these incidents suggest the margin of
safety, rather than it is on the brink of collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   But what about the future? Taking the long view, there is reason
for concern about the nation's air traffic control system.
Unplanned outages of power, computers, and radar have been
increasing steadily in recent years as equipment is extended well
beyond its normal life.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the Boston Center, located in Nashua, N.H., where
controllers handle all the high altitude flights over New England
and upstate New York. Earlier this year, they faced, on average, an
outage a day. The outages lasted anywhere from a few seconds to
more than a half-hour. But when a radar screen loses crucial data,
controllers _ responsible for keeping planes safely separated _
have no way of knowing if it will reappear with the next radar
sweep, in 12 seconds, or in 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
   And nationwide, in 1983 the total unscheduled downtime for air
traffic and navigation equipment was 210,000 hours. In 1997, it was
600,000 hours.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, the Reagan administration vowed to rebuild
the air traffic control system with new technology. But the Federal
Aviation Administration underestimated the cost and complexity of
the task. Parts of the system were obsolete before they could even
be delivered. So equipment that was old in the early 1980s is still
being used today.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA says it will have to spend at least $42 billion to
modernize the air traffic system _ an amount that makes the
nation's largest public works road project, Boston's Big Dig, look
like chump change. FAA Administrator Jane Garvey has said
modernization is her top priority.
</P>
<P>
   Some new equipment _ long-range radar systems, computers, and
controller displays _ are already being installed around the
country. They are going to the centers that handle high altitude
traffic; to the facilities (called TRACONs) where controllers
direct planes as soon as they leave major airports, or just before
they start their final approaches; and to airport towers, which
handle arriving and departing planes and those on the ground. But
complete modernization is still a ways off.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even more alarming than the old equipment is the
shortage of people who are qualified to repair it. And spare parts
can be as hard to come by as a certified technician.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have major facilities across the country that do not have
certified people on duty during critical times, and the agency
rolls the dice that nothing will occur during those hours,'' says
Michael Fanfalone, president of the Professional Airways Systems
Specialists, the union representing the technicians who maintain
and repair computers, radar, power systems, and navigation aids.
Los Angeles Airport, he said, does not have technicians on duty 24
hours to repair radar. And in one metropolitan New York facility,
technicians are cannibalizing radar displays for parts to keep the
system working.
</P>
<P>
   Why the shortage of technicians and spare parts? In large part
it is due to the FAA's failure to modernize the system as it
planned nearly 20 years ago. Why keep technicians on, the agency
reasoned, if we will have a new automated system? The only problem
is the new system has yet to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the IBM computers used to run air traffic are so old
that all the engineers who worked on them have retired from IBM.
The FAA could find only one former IBM official willing to go over
millions of lines of code in a mainframe computer used by
controllers to see if the system will be affected by the Year 2000
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the FAA insists the system remains safe.
</P>
<P>
   While one can argue about how much safety is compromised by old
equipment, understaffing, and lack of spare parts, it is
irrefutable that those problems slow the entire system down. Planes
that would have been in the air are kept on the ground, and those
in the air are spaced farther apart. The results are delays and
cancellations that cost consumers.
</P>
<P>
   A panel appointed by Congress, the National Civil Aviation
Review Commission, had this dire warning a year ago: ``Unless the
FAA and various aviation stakeholders _ the Congress, the Executive
Branch, and the aviation community _ change the status quo,
internal and external to the FAA, our nation's aviation system will
succumb to gridlock. Delays will skyrocket while we reminisce about
the reliable flight schedules of the past. This current course will
impair our domestic economy, reduce our standing in the global
marketplace, and result in a long term deterioration of aviation
safety.''
</P>
<P>
   The FAA has big plans for the future, including the use of an
enhanced global positioning system, or GPS, to help planes navigate
more accurately, and enable them to fly from point A to point B
without having to follow the sometimes-winding route required by
ground-based navigation aids. But the FAA recently had to scale
back its vision of the enhanced GPS satellite systems (known as
WAAS and LAAS) because of a variety of risks, including its cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are relooking at alternatives, keeping more ground
navigation aids, and we are revalidating our cost-benefit study,''
says Steven Zaidman, associate administrator for Research and
Aquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Zaidman, however, says the replacement of the existing computer
and radar display systems controllers use is going ahead and
controllers will have new systems within a matter of months, and
virtually all should have new systems by the middle of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   And the agency is working with the industry to promote so-called
``free flight,'' in which pilots will eventually navigate by
satellite. The idea will take many years to implement, but under
phase one, some facilities will receive equipment by 2002 that will
let pilots and controllers communicate by airborne e-mail, which
should improve communications, and controllers will have better
tools to help them identify potential conflicts in flight patterns.
Prototypes are already in Memphis and Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   But long before ``free flight'' is a reality, the FAA is likely
to experience significant problems upgrading the current computer
and radar display systems with more modern computers.
</P>
<P>
   The backup system that controllers use when the main system is
down, or being replaced, is referred to as DARC. But controllers
say they have little experience working on DARC. As a result, there
is confusion whenever the primary system fails.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Transportation inspector general, in a report
released two weeks ago, and the National Transportation Safety
Board, in a report released two years ago, agreed with the
controllers' demand for more DARC training. The FAA says the
twice-a-year training (much of it video-based) that controllers
receive in DARC is sufficient, even though it does not include
using simulated traffic patterns on the computer system.
</P>
<P>
   While Mike McNally, president of the National Air Traffic
Controllers Association, applauds many of the technological
improvements the FAA is pushing, he says it is imperative
controllers get more training in DARC. And McNally said controllers
also need refresher training in how to safely separate airplanes
when there is no radar coverage at all. ``We've all had that at
some point, but it could have been 10 years ago or more.''
</P>

   Why is it needed? Radar occasionally does go out; or the
computer failure is so extensive that controllersrely on radio and
pencil and paper. And there are concerns about the new millennium:
``We need the training because of Y2K there could be an extensive

BUT WHAT ABOUT THE CHILDREN? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN McNAMARA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They are 10 years old. That's old enough to tell you that the
music you listen to is lame, but young enough to consider ``Jingle
Bells'' the definitive Christmas carol. It's old enough to insist
on cargo pants and waffle-weave shirts as a daytime uniform, but
young enough to prefer pajamas with cartoon characters at bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   They are fourth graders, one-third of the public school
population that took the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment
System test last spring, one-third of the 208,800 students in
grades four, eight and 10 whose skills were evaluated in math,
science, and English.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, too many fourth graders failed in one or more subject
areas; too few earned an advanced score. The airwaves crackle with
talk of a crisis in education. The schoolyards hum with the
whispers of anxious parents.
</P>
<P>
   As so often happens with issues involving our children, the
focus has been on the impact of the MCAS results on adults. Will
school superintendents face political pressure? Will principals be
browbeaten? Will individual teachers be forced to alter their
teaching style? Will parents need to help more with homework? Will
legislators reconsider spending levels for education?
</P>
<P>
   But what about the kids who are at the heart of all this? Should
we tell a 10-year-old that she failed the MCAS test or that she
earned an advanced score? Does she need to know where her score
fell in a range between 200 and 280? Will that number mean anything
more to her than yet another opportunity to see how she stacks up
against her pals?
</P>
<P>
   Arguably, students in the eighth or 10th grade can use the
results as an incentive to do better or as reassurance that they
are on the right track. By now, they are pros at the standardized
test routine, veterans of the IOWAs, the ERBs, the MEAPs, the
PSATs. The SATs loom. And starting with the Class of 2003, students
must have passed the 10th grade MCAS test to graduate. It makes
some sense to know how challenging that goal will be.
</P>
<P>
   But what about those 10-year-olds who often look so grown up but
are still so young in the less visible places, where it counts?
</P>
<P>
   The comparison game starts too young in too many arenas already:
the boy convinced there is no point in playing soccer because his
coach says he'll never make the ``A'' team. The girl who quits
piano because she's convinced she'll never play as well as her best
friend. At 10, the world is black and white. ``Are we rich?'' they
ask when you park a new car in the driveway. ``Are we poor?'' they
ask when you tell them that the new car is a used car. Angst, once
the province of adolescence, strikes at an ever younger age. At 10,
they are already asking, ``Am I a geek? Am I cool? Am I smart? Am I
dumb?''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the adults tell them the MCAS test is a
baseline, a tool for improvement, not evaluation. Children have
especially acute radar for hypocrisy. They hear us say that no
single test is an accurate measure of performance. But what do they
see? A mother indignant because her son was deemed proficient in
math when it's clear to her that he is advanced. A father enraged
because his daughter failed, even though she insists she studies
hard.
</P>
<P>
   Mom says he is special; the test says he is merely competent.
Dad says she is lazy; the test says she is a failure. Who reminds
these children that they are 10-year-olds - works in progress?
</P>
<P>
   The disconnect in our homes between what we say and what we do
is as evident on a communal level. John Silber, the chairman of the
state Board of Education, says, ``If you know what the
socioeconomic conditions are in different communities, you have
about 60 percent of all the information you need to predict their
scores.'' Then he talks about how to raise test scores, not how to
address the underlying issues responsible for them. We are going to
spend $20 million for remedial help for students who performed
poorly. How much are we willing to spend for day care, for job
training, for affordable housing, to lift their families out of the
poverty that contributed to those scores?
</P>
<P>
   The night the test results were released, my family made its
annual shopping trip for Christmas ornaments to Lord's, the general
store on Main Street in Medfield, a town where we once lived. The
place was abuzz with talk about Medfield's second place ranking in
overall achievement on the MCAS. ``The value of our houses just
went up,'' the cashier said with real pride. ``We never should have
moved,'' said my son with genuine alarm. And I hadn't even told him
his MCAS score. And I won't.

WANTED: AN EDMUND G. ROSS TO SAVE US FROM OURSELVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If we don't learn from history, the saying goes, we are doomed
to repeat it. As Congress drives recklessley driven toward the
impeachment of President Clinton, doomed is the appropriate word.
</P>
<P>
   Our nation's democracy could have been, if not doomed, at least
seriously harmed 130 years ago, if not for the one courageous vote
cast against the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment process then was as partisan as it is today.
And, ironically, the group that led the rush toward impeachment in
1868 consisted of radical Republicans, a group not much different
in both name and deed from those seeking Clinton's impeachment and
ouster from office today.
</P>
<P>
   The road toward impeachment for Johnson began when those radical
Republicans split with the party's moderates over how to treat
South after the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   The moderates, President Johnson among them, wanted to follow
through on President Abraham Lincoln's plans of reunion and
reconciliation toward the South. The radical Republicans, spurred
on by Lincoln's murder, wanted reprisals and retribution against
the South.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson rejected the radical Republicans' plan, and continued to
pursue reconciliation. And therein lay the seeds of the impeachment
effort.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to seize control of the government, the radical
Republicans passed a law, over Johnson's veto, that prevented a
president from removing a cabinet officer he appoints. Johnson,
knowing that the law was unconstitutional, ignored it. He fired a
disloyal cabinet member, Secretary of War Edwin Stanton.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Stanton's Republican backers accused Johnson of a
``high crime and misdemeanor.'' In fact, as history has shown,
Johnson did not even violate the law, since Stanton was appointed
not by Johnson, but by Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, it was not a violation of the law, but an intense hatred
of Johnson by the radical Republicans that fueled the drive toward
impeachment. And it is the right-wing Republicans' hatred of
Clinton that is driving the impeachment process today.
</P>
<P>
   The 1868 House vote for impeachment of Johnson was strictly
along party lines; no Democrat voted for it, no Republican against
it.
</P>
<P>
   On the 1998 Judiciary Committee, the votes for articles of
impeachment against Clinton last week were also strictly on
partisan lines. Among the 37 members, all 21 Republicans for the
articles, all 16 Democrats against. The House vote on impeachment
this week is also expected to be largely along partisan lines, with
Clinton's supporters hoping to persuade enough moderate Republicans
to vote against impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The House vote on impeachment this week is seen as too close to
call _ reminiscent of the 1868 Senate vote on whether to convict or
acquit Johnson of a high crime and misdemeanor. Johnson's, and the
nation's, fate was decided by a single vote.
</P>
<P>
   One of the radical Republican's own, Edmund G. Ross of Kansas,
broke with his colleagues and cast the deciding vote against
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   If Johnson had been impeached, Benjamin Wade, the president pro
tempore of the Senate and a Republican, would have been the next
President and the radical Republicans would have carried out their
scorched earth policy against the South.
</P>
<P>
   Ross later wrote to explain his vote: ``If the president must
step down upon insufficient proofs and from partisan
considerations, the office of president would be degraded'' and
``ever after subordinated to the legislative will.'' He added,
``this government had never faced so insidious a danger.''
</P>
<P>
   It is today as it was 130 years ago, when Sen. Charles Sumner
declared, ``Impeachment is a political proceeding before a
political body with a political purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, today's impeachment proceeding is driven by politics and
fueled by hatred and contempt, just as in Johnson's day. Justice
had nothing to do with either proceeding, because justice both
times was pushed aside by a very partisan group of Republicans
seeking to destroy a president they could not control.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's second impeachment proceeding _ against President
Nixon _ was different. After hearing the facts, few doubted that
Nixon indeed did commit high crimes and misdemeanors, including
obstruction of justice during his attempted coverup of the break-in
of the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate
Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee vote for impeachment against Nixon
came on July 27, 1974, when six Republicans joined 21 Democrats in
the 27-11 vote for the first article of impeachment. Less than two
weeks later, Nixon resigned from office rather than face almost
certain ouster. In this instance, justice prevailed over partisan
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, when the impeachment process is in the wrong hands
_ as it was during Johnson's tenure and as it is in Clinton's _
those driving the process can, in one blast, politically execute a
president and subvert the constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps there will be a voice _ or voices _ of reason that will
come forth, as Ross did 130 years ago, to prevent an impeachment
vote against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   If there is anything to be learned from the impeachment
proceedings against President Johnson, it's that somewhere in
Congress there are Republicans like Ross who can bring this nation
back from the brink of disaster. All they need to do is to gather
their courage and vote ``no'' against an unfair, partisan,
mean-spirited and dangerous impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   They will know, as did Ross, that they did it not merely to save
Clinton, but to save their country.

THE MEANING OF THE MCAS: EDUCATION REFORM IS DEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the great frauds in modern Massachusetts politics was the
Education Reform Act of 1993. Though the law ran to hundreds of
paragraphs, its premise was simple: Throw more money at public
education, and public education will improve.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem with public schooling in Massachusetts, as in
most of America, was never a shortage of dollars. It was a shortage
of accountability. Students who didn't feel like studying knew
their teachers would promote them anyway. Teachers who didn't feel
like mastering their subject or working hard in the classroom knew
their union contract would protect them from being disciplined or
fired. Principals and superintendents who didn't feel like whipping
lousy schools into shape knew that most parents would have little
choice but to keep sending their kids back, year after year after
year.
</P>
<P>
   Government-run schools were doing such a poor job because they
faced no penalty for incompetence. Along came the Education Reform
Act and said: Let's reward incompetence. The treasury's sluices
were thrown open. Money rained down on the very people who had
wrecked the schools in the first place. Five years and $5 billion
of education ``reform'' later, students are as ignorant as ever.
</P>
<P>
   The statewide MCAS test scores released last week are a horror.
Students in the 4th, 8th, and 10th grades were tested in English,
science, and math, and they performed miserably. In every grade and
every subject, save for 8th-grade English, a majority of students
either did poorly or failed outright. Fifty percent of all
10th-graders flunked the math test; another 24 percent wound up in
the second-lowest ``needs improvement'' tier. Among 4th-graders, a
stunning 81 percent earned low marks in English. In science, 71
percent of 8th-graders scored at the lowest levels.
</P>
<P>
   The MCAS (Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System) was not
overly tough. On the 8th-grade math test, for example, students
confronted this question: ``According to the 1990 Census, the
population of Massachusetts was 6,016,425. Approximately what
percent of those people lived in Boston?'' The population of Boston
was given as 574,283, and students were offered four choices: (a)
10%, (b) 20%, (c) 30%, and (d) 40%. That is a question an alert
5th-grader should have no trouble with. Three out of four
8th-graders got it wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, which spends more per pupil than almost any other
jurisdiction, the results stank.
</P>
<P>
   In one school, every 4th-grader failed in science and 70 percent
failed in math. More than two-thirds of the 8th-graders can't do
math; three-fourths don't know science. Nearly 90 percent of
10th-graders in the regular high schools failed math; 60 percent
failed English. Unsurprisingly, at the city's worst high school _
the Jeremiah Burke _ virtually every student failed everything. But
even the allegedly elite exam schools disgraced themselves. Among
10-graders in Boston Latin Academy, for example, 87 percent earned
poor or failing marks in science; 71 percent did so in math.
</P>
<P>
   In the real world, only an employer intent on bankruptcy would
hand out fat raises to his least competent employees. But in the
warped world of public education, the crummiest schools and
teachers get the most lavish bonuses. The schools that did poorest
on the MCAS will not be shut down. Their principals will not be
fired. No: They will be given a bounty of $20 million. This is what
passes for education reform.
</P>
<P>
   Since April there have been three rounds of state tests for
prospective teachers. These are exams any diligent high school
student should be able to ace, yet 45 percent or more of would-be
teachers _ graduates of colleges of education _ have flunked.
Beacon Hill did not respond by increasing salaries for teachers of
proven excellence, or by stripping the inept education schools of
their credentialing power. No: It authorized $20,000 bonuses for
new, inexperienced teachers so that colleges of education can
recruit even more students. This too is what passes for education
reform.
</P>
<P>
   On the day the atrocious MCAS scores were released, the
Massachusetts teachers union issued a press release. ``The first
year's results should be used to establish a baseline, not to judge
the success of education reform . . . . Education reform is a work
in progress . . . . The Massachusetts public education system as a
whole is very good.'' This nonsense promptly became the line of the
education bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Superintendent Thomas Payzant: ``We don't have to
scramble. This is a baseline. We expect progress in years one, two,
and three.''
</P>
<P>
   State Senator Robert Antonioni, Education Committee co-chairman:
``I wouldn't read too much into this one way or the other. This is
the first time it's been given.''
</P>
<P>
   Board of Education Chairman John Silber: ``I am . . . pleasantly
surprised with the scores on the MCAS. It doesn't give parents,
teachers, administrators, or school committees any cause for
alarm.''
</P>
<P>
   Cambridge Superintendent Bobbie D'Alessandro: ``Remember, this
is just the beginning of the journey and not the destination.''
Wrong. The MCAS debacle is not the ``beginning'' but the end. The
Education Reform Act was an expensive failure. The state's
government schools are wretched and will remain wretched. This is
as good as it gets. ``Reform'' is over. The children lost.

CLINTON, UNLIKE NIXON, COULD BOW OUT AS MARTYR 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ He's a nice guy, active in liberal politics,
bright as hell. He called me with this question:
</P>
<P>
   ``Daniel, where was your mind at when you wrote that column?
Didn't you pick up anything from the last election? Nobody cares
what Bill Clinton did in the privacy of his own home with another
consenting adult.''
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton riding a 65 percent approval rating despite the
televised commission of a felony _ namely, perjury before a grand
jury _ I'd written that I simply can't shake the image of Richard
Nixon gazing up from Hell, frowning deeply and marveling at the
Clinton spin team's altogether astonishing job here.
</P>
<P>
   My friend was saying _ like so many other suckers, I'm afraid _
that this is only about sex. It isn't. But, just for argument's
sake, let's pretend it is.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, sex is a gift from God. And what a clever idea on Her
part. But is consensual sex inherently OK under all circumstances?
Or, is there consensual sex that's irresponsible, cruel and hurtful
to others and degrading to everybody forced to confront it? And, if
you believe there is, are you just a puritanical simpleton with a
perverted preoccupation with the uses to which other people put
their genitalia? Or are you a realist?
</P>
<P>
   Also, Clinton didn't fool around with his intern in his own
home. He did this thing in the public's workplace, the Oval Office.
So, the other day, I called my friend back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey,` I said, ``did you see today's story about the four
Albany County Jail guards? They got fired because they were getting
sex from inmates in exchange for cigarettes. That was consensual
sex in a public workplace, just like Clinton and his intern. Do you
think it was fair that they lost their jobs while Clinton keeps
his?''
</P>
<P>
   He hemmed and hawed. Different thing, he said. The jail business
was bribery.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, I said, but it wasn't perjury, was it?
</P>
<P>
   And that's the central issue here _ not sex, however tawdry and
distasteful, but perjury, perjury, perjury. And commission of that
felony, admittedly combined with fierce partisanship in the House
of Representatives, is what led to the Judiciary Committee to
recommend the impeachment of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't been following this, start right now. Twenty-four
years ago, Richard Nixon shocked the nation by resigning after the
committee recommended impeachment _ but before the full House
acted. That's because he knew that he'd committed felonies. And he
feared that, once impeached, he couldn't be pardoned and could face
criminal action somewhere down the road.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution forbids any president to pardon anybody for
``an impeachable offense.'' The question is whether that means a
criminal offense for which the House impeaches or an offense that
also requires Senate conviction. No court has ever interpreted that
language, and Nixon wasn't taking any chances.
</P>
<P>
   So he made a deal with Gerald Ford and said, ``check, please.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton knows what perjury is. He probably could pardon himself,
but impeachment might invalidate it unless he resigns before the
House votes. He could also cut a deal for Al Gore to pardon him,
and then pull a Nixon. With two out of three people backing him
instead of the one in four supporting Nixon when he left, Clinton
could still portray himself on his way out the door as the innocent
victim of partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   Were he to quit now, given all the suckers around, Clinton's
approval rating might even go up. Unlike Nixon, Clinton could end
up like Andrew Johnson, whose enemies in Congress are recalled by
history as venal, vindictive losers.
</P>
<P>
   Will he do it? Who knows? Remember, though, everybody thought
Nixon would go down sword in hand.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he left office with a prudent whimper.
</P>

CONNECTICUT SHOULD REJECT BAD PATRIOTS STADIUM DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If someone had walked into Governor Abraham Ribicoff's office in
December 1958 and proposed that the state of Connecticut spend tens
of millions of dollars to build a new stadium for a mediocre,
out-of-state football team, he or she would have been asked to
leave. If that same person, backpedaling toward the exit door, had
gone on to propose that virtually all of the economic benefits of
the stadium would accrue to the owner of said mediocre football
team, he or she would have been regarded as deranged.
</P>
<P>
   What was true then is true today. Publicly financed stadiums
don't generate economic activity. If anything, they displace it. If
you have any doubts about this, visit the South Bronx, where the
most profitable sports franchise in America, the New York Yankees,
reside.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly financed stadiums don't ``pay for themselves.'' If you
have any doubts about this, revisit the South Bronx, where Yankee
owner George Steinbrenner now says he needs more public money to
``enable'' him to keep his team in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly financed stadium deals are, by definition, corporate
welfare. Or, as business columnist Jim Suroweicki wrote this week,
``no deal in which a state or city puts up hundreds of millions of
dollars to build a stadium from which a sports team will derive all
the profit is a good deal.''
</P>
<P>
   For these very reasons, it now seems likely that Connecticut
Governor John Rowland's wacky scheme to bring the New England
Patriots to Hartford will collapse in a heap, as well it should.
Rowland offered Patriots owner Robert Kraft what can fairly be
described as the sweetheart stadium deal of the 20th century. Smith
College professor Andrew Zimblast, an expert on such matters,
recently catalogued the extent of the giveaway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal,'' Zimblast wrote, ``includes, at Connecticut's
expense, a riverfront stadium for at least $280 million, $70
million to acquire and improve the site, $25 million to $100
million for environmental cleanup, land for a pavilion and hotel, a
$15 million practice facility, $170 million in a fund for future
improvements, and assorted state guarantees.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In return, Robert Kraft, the team owner, would pay no rent for
the 30-year life of the deal and keep all the revenue from ticket
sales, luxury suites, parking, concessions, and so on. All told,
Kraft's stadium income could be $100 million a year. The state
would get only a 10 percent ticket tax.''
</P>
<P>
   As in all bad deals, a prestigious accounting firm was engaged
to obfuscate matters. To no one's surprise, the firm engaged, KPMG
Peat Marwick, reported back that the state would break even on the
stadium when all was said and done. The deal, the firm said, was
``revenue neutral.''
</P>
<P>
   KPMG consultants may well be the only people extant who actually
believe this. An independent analysis conducted by the Connecticut
state Legislature's Office of Fiscal Analysis (OFA) found that the
state would, of course, lose money on the deal, and OFA's analysis
didn't even consider the opportunity costs.
</P>
<P>
   As details of the extent of the giveaway have surfaced,
Connecticut legislators have grown increasingly nervous about the
sudden rush to enact enabling legislation. In fact, key legislators
are now said to be wondering whether the deal should be scuttled
altogether. ``The mood has changed,'' says one Rowland adviser.
``We're scrambling to keep this thing on the rails.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Rowland announced that he would go back to Patriots
owner Robert Kraft to try to get new language that would
significantly decrease Connecticut's exposure to downside risk.
``There may be some changes in the guarantee,'' said Rowland,
meaning that there would have to be to keep key legislators on
board. Rowland's problem is that Kraft and his family have no real
incentive to give up what they have already gained. From their
point of view, ``a deal's a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   What is most amazing about all this is that there is a fairly
simple solution to the Patriots' problem. Let us say that the
Patriots are worth (and this is a very generous assessment) $350
million. Let us further say that they need $150 million in stadium
and infrastructure improvements. Let us overlook the fact that they
are a profitable enterprise and say that they need a state or
municipal government to provide them with the $150 million worth of
improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Fine. Connecticut or Massachusetts cuts a check for that amount.
Either state then builds a stadium, does the improvements, builds
the practice facility, etc. In return, the state gets a 30 percent
ownership stake in the team and is entitled to 30 percent of the
team's annual profits. The state also gets two seats on the board,
but pledges not to interfere with management, except in cases of
fiduciary or criminal misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut should insist on just such a deal. Anything less
will lead to nothing but grief. If Kraft balks and moves his team
to Los Angeles as a result, good riddance. Better the lesser fool
than the greater one.

TEST FOR BUSH AND TEXAS IN NEAR-EXECUTION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush, the would-be or wouldn't-be
president, got another taste of international diplomacy during the
debate over Texas' near-execution of a Canadian man.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Stanley Faulder escaped death by about 30 minutes last
week when the U.S. Supreme Court ordered a stay of his scheduled
execution for the 1974 robbery and murder of 75-year-old Inez
Phillips of Gladewater.
</P>
<P>
   His case created a controversy in Canada, which blew into Austin
like a blast of Arctic air. It may not have been a clash of
cultures, but it definitely was a clash of opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Canada doesn't have the death penalty, presumably because many _
if not most _ Canadians oppose it. Texas does, and has carried it
out 19 times this year alone and officeholders such as Bush believe
it has strong support among Texans.
</P>
<P>
   At an Austin news conference, one Canadian reporter asked Bush
what he would say to Canadians ``who seem to think that your state
is running kind of a Wild West show down here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a Canadian and you come to our state, don't murder
anybody,'' Bush replied. He also insisted that Texas sought to
assure due process for all, including death row convicts.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was peppered with questions from several Canadian
journalists, who had traveled to Texas to cover Faulder's case. But
he refused to be drawn into a debate over the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   He maintained his cool, prompting some observers to note that if
he were in training for a presidential race, he passed an early,
minor test.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's potential political future, however, is only a
byproduct of the debate over Faulder. The relevant issue is Texas'
clemency process, which once again has been challenged in a capital
murder case receiving international attention.
</P>
<P>
   Had it not been for the U.S. Supreme Court, Faulder most likely
would have been executed.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles rejected Faulder's
petition for clemency. Without a board recommendation for
commutation of the death sentence or some other form of clemency,
the only option remaining for the governor was one 30-day stay, or
delay, of the execution.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has never granted a stay of execution, including in the
case of Karla Faye Tucker, who was put to death early this year for
her part in two pickax murders in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker also received tons of international publicity. Unlike
Faulder, however, Tucker didn't find a receptive court.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's actions were consistent in the Faulder debate. Despite
pressure from U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and
Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy, who contended that Texas'
handling of Faulder's case violated an international treaty, the
governor didn't intervene on his own.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely does the parole board recommend clemency for a death row
convict. One of the few cases in recent years occurred a few months
ago, when the board recommended commutation of alleged serial
killer Henry Lee Lucas' death sentence to life imprisonment, and
Bush agreed.
</P>
<P>
   The board and the governor believed that sufficient doubt had
been cast on the evidence in the only case for which Lucas received
the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Faulder's case may result in a judicial review of Texas'
clemency process, which has repeatedly been attacked by death
penalty opponents as secretive and unfair.
</P>
<P>
   Bush obviously believes the parole board, which he appoints,
does its job diligently and fairly and would never knowingly deny
clemency to someone wrongly sentenced to death. And his faith in
the panel is probably justified. Faulder once confessed to the
murder for which he was convicted and didn't raise a claim of
innocence in his clemency petition.
</P>
<P>
   But the way the board normally conducts its business in clemency
decisions _ taking votes by fax machine or telephone from 18
members scattered about the state _ creates at the very least a
public relations and potential political problem.
</P>
<P>
   Many people will always oppose the death penalty, but regardless
of how one views capital punishment, there should be more openness
in the parole board's clemency procedures.
</P>
<P>
   It may be impractical for all 18 members to meet in the same
place to vote on every case. But maybe we should consider requiring
board members to cast their votes _ and state their reasons for
voting _ over conference call hookups, which reporters and other
members of the public could monitor at a central location.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer friend says my suggestion is fraught with potential
problems. But state law already requires a school board or a county
commissioners court to meet in public to discuss something as
mundane as a printing contract.
</P>
<P>
   What's wrong with shining more light on life-and-death
decisions?

A   5,000-YEAR-OLD PRESCRIPTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The history of western medicine just got longer _ by a couple of
thousand years.
</P>
<P>
   More than five millenia ago, Stone Age people in Europe had a
highly evolved system of medical diagnosis and treatment, judging
from new clues provided by the Ice Man, whose well-preserved mummy
emerged seven years ago from a melting glacier in northern Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Recent analysis of the Ice Man's remains, along with two
heretofore puzzling walnut-sized spheres he was carrying on his
fatal expedition, has yielded evidence of some of the earliest
known uses of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The two spheres, threaded on leather thongs, were not tinder for
starting fires, as researchers earlier believed. Instead, Professor
Luigi Capasso of Italy's National Archeological Museum has found,
they are the woody fruit of a tree fungus that acts as a powerful
but short-acting laxative and also contains oils that are toxic to
intestinal parasites.
</P>
<P>
   That find dovetails with the earlier discovery by Professor
Horst Aspoeck and his colleagues at the University of Vienna, who
examined the contents of the mummy's intestines and discovered the
eggs of Trichuria trichiura, an intestinal worm that probably
caused the Ice Man periodic pain and anemia.
</P>
<P>
   Putting the evidence together in the British journal The Lancet,
Capasso concludes that the Ice Man (or his tribal healer) was able
to recognize the nature of his illness and use a remedy that was
remarkably specific for his condition.
</P>
<P>
   The remedy would have killed at least some of the intestinal
parasites and purged the bowel of its eggs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The discovery of the fungus suggests that the Ice Man was
aware of his intestinal parasites and fought them with measured
doses of Piptoporus betulinus,'' Capasso writes in the medical
journal. ``The toxic oils in the fungus were probably the only
remedy available in Europe'' until thousands of years later, when
considerably more toxic oils to treat parasite infections were
imported from the New World.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans' use of the American fungus to treat intestinal worms
persisted until the past century, Capasso said in a interview.
``The laxative was used in popular medicine in Italy and Poland to
facilitate the excretion of the worm,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Capasso, who specializes in diseases of prehistoric humans,
notes that other archeologists have found evidence of vegetable
oils in coprolites _ fossilized feces _ from prehistoric sites in
Utah and Nevada, possibly signifying that these peoples were trying
also to treat infestations of intestinal worms.
</P>
<P>
   There is no sign of parasite eggs and worm fragments in the
North American coprolites that bear traces of oils, in contrast to
other samples from the same time and regions. That ``demonstrates
the efficacy of the oil in the cure of intestinal worms,'' Capasso
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he said he was surprised to find such ancient
evidence of prehistoric parasite disease and treatment in the Ice
Man, who died about 5,300 years ago. ``We have no other finding in
this condition of comparable antiquity for Europe.'' Ancient
Egyptians concocted complicated remedies for specific diseases, but
Capasso said the earliest Egyptian evidence he knows of _ a
prescription on papyrus for a brew of macerated pomegranate bark
and beer to treat a parasitic disease the Egyptians called ``aaa''
_ is one or two milennia more recent than the Ice Man's era.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the evidence of parasites in the Ice Man's bowel
and the fungal remedy he was carrying, Capasso discovered that his
fingernails were underdeveloped in a pattern that suggested
repeated interruptions of their growth. In addition, the iron
content of his skeletal muscles was abnormally low.
</P>
<P>
   Both these clues are consistent, the researcher noted, with the
growth cycle of Trichuris trichiura, an intestinal parasite known
to cause anemia, or iron depletion.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence suggests, Capasso said, ``the man had recurrent
generalized stress at roughly 30-day intervals during the last
phase of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   The fungal spheres are the strongest hints thus far that the Ice
Man may have benefited from a system of medical knowledge, but
they're not the only signs.
</P>
<P>
   Capasso suggested in 1993 that the many tattoos on the Ice Man's
body were not decorations but the traces of therapy for muscle and
joint pain. From evidence that includes medical and surgical
instruments found in the ruins of Pompeii, destroyed in A.D. 79 by
an eruption of Mt. Vesuvius, researchers know the tattoos were made
with special scalpels and the incisions filled with herb mixtures
that were then set on fire. The heat cauterized the wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Ice Man's tattoos, Capasso noted, were on the skin
over joints in the spine, knee, and ankle that showed clear signs
of arthritis. ``The Ice Man might have used these tattoos as a form
of localized therapy for muscle and joint pain,'' Capasso said.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard anthropologist David Pilbeam, a specialist in
paleolithic cultures, welcomed Capasso's findings as an antidote to
conventional thinking about ``primitive'' humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have empirical minds,'' Pilbeam said. ``Western culture
tends to underestimate the knowledge base of other cultures and
other times.''

WHAT'S IN FLATUS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Why is it that lighting a match seems to dispel the odor of
flatulence?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Intestinal gas is not heavily studied. But Dr. Michael
Levitt, chief of research at the Minneapolis Veterans
Administration Hospital, has studied flatus since 1965.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think lighting a match covers up the smell more than it
actually dispels the odor,'' he says. He believes the combustion
does change some of the offending molecules so they no longer bind
with the same smell receptors in the nose, but that mostly it
provides olfactory camouflage until the flatus dissipates.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt says most of the gas we produce (on average, up to 2,000
milliliters, or about 120 cubic inches, in 13-14 episodes daily) is
non-aromatic, made up of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide,
hydrogen, and methane. (Methane is natural gas, the kind we cook
with.)
</P>
<P>
   Most of these gasses are produced when bacteria in our
intestines feast on food not fully broken down. That's why some
fruits and vegetables with complex carbohydrates that we can't
fully digest are so gaseously productive. A small portion of the
gas we pass is plain old air we swallow as we eat.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt says less than 1 part in 10,000 of flatus is odiferous.
Hydrogen sulfide, methanethiol, and dimethyl sulfide are the
principal nasal nasties. Sulfur is the key ingredient in all of
them. Half of it comes from what we eat. Half is naturally
produced, in our bile, and in the mucus and linings of the
intestine.
</P>
<P>
   These gases are highly toxic. We've evolved to detect them at
extremely low levels, so it doesn't take many molecules to trigger
a response. (They're chemically similar to the ingredients in skunk
spray and the odorant added to natural gas so we can detect leaks.)
</P>
<P>
   To confirm what makes flatus smell unpleasant, Levitt fed study
participants pinto beans and collected the resulting gas before
passage. The gaseous components were analyzed and separated. Two
``smell experts'' said the most unpleasant were the hydrogen
sulfide, methanethiol, and dimethyl sulfide.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we should send Levitt an air freshener for his lab.

   Several alert readers have corrected us about the explanation on
how the calorie totals on food packaging are calculated. They point
out that the calorie (small c) on food packaging, is actually a
Calorie (capital C). That's a kilocalorie, 1,000 calories. Which is
bad news for those dieters trying to cut down on the calories they
consume by counting the Calories on food package labels.

PENSION PLAN OFFERS AN INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BY KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I recently received a proposal from a company where I used to
work, giving me a number of options involving my pension. At what
age would it be best to start taking my pension benefits, and could
you suggest a fund to have the money deposited in? I am now 48
years old, and I plan on retiring at age 59. The earliest I would
qualify for benefits is Nov. 1, 2000, when I will be 50 years old.
If I did that, I would be paid $279 per month. Other benefits, and
the age at which I would qualify for them are $385 a month at age
55, $533 at age 60, $649 at age 62, and $839 at age 65.
</P>
<P>
   W.R., Port Murray, N.J. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If you have the discipline to follow through on this, my
instinct would be to take the pension at the earliest age you can
and then religiously invest the benefits for your retirement.
Here's an example: Suppose you drew down the $279 a month at age 50
and invested all the benefits in a stock mutual fund. Suppose
further that the fund achieved average 10 percent annual returns.
After nine years you would have accumulated $47,633.
</P>
<P>
   Now suppose that when you retire you moved this money from your
stock fund and reinvested it in fixed-income holdings providing you
with a 6.5 percent yield. Thus you could expect that $47,633 to
bring in $258 a month. Combined with the ongoing pension benefit,
this would give you a $537 monthly income stream _ pretty close to
the $553 you would be eligible for if you waited until age 60. In
fact, if you continued investing your pension benefits until age
60, the pool would grow to $55,903, using the same assumptions, and
from that you might expect a $302 income stream. That would combine
with the continued $297 pension benefits to give you $581 a month
income _ better than the pension would have offered at age 60.
</P>
<P>
   These projections assume not only that you use other funds to
pay the taxes that result from the pension payments, but also that
you pay any tax liabilities that the ongoing savings pool
generates. You may be able to use a tax-deferred savings vehicle
such as an IRA or a 410(k) to get away from the latter category of
taxes, but if you take the pension benefits at age 60, count on
paying taxes on an extra $3,350 annual income.
</P>
<P>
   But why _ I hear you ask _ why pay all those taxes and also
assume the uncertainties of the markets if I'm going to end up with
an income stream that's very similar to what I'd get if I simply
started drawing from the pension at age 60? The answer is that if
you follow the program outlined above until age 60, you would not
only have the larger income stream, but you would also have that
$55,903 in principal _ a fund which you could you count on in
emergencies, or as a part of your estate.
</P>
<P>
   As for investments, I'd go pretty straight down the line,
putting half the money in a mutual fund that tracks the Standard
and Poor's 500 Index (or a subset thereof) and the other half in a
solid balanced fund. With the Vanguard family, for example, you
might select the Most other fund families offer similar funds.
</P>
<P>
   As for the later pension options, they become attractive only if
you expect to live to a very ripe old age _ well past age 80; in
your situation I'd take the bird that comes to hand in two years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am confused. I need income to supplement my pension. I have
$40,000 in the Vanguard GNMA fund. What's wrong with the long-term
bond fund, which has a higher yield? I understand that the price of
a share will probably fluctuate more, but if one is only interested
in the income from the fund, wouldn't the long-term fund be better?
</P>
<P>
   V.B., Brea, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I've never been particularly enthusiastic about long bonds,
mostly because I don't think the spread between the rate paid on
these bonds and on shorter-term instruments is adequate to reward
the holder for the extra risk that goes along with the longer
duration.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, in the current market, there's only one Vanguard fund
with a higher yield than its GNMA fund, and that's the High Yield
Corporate Bond _ read ``junk bond'' _ fund.
</P>
<P>
   The latter has a yield of 8.47 percent as this is written,
compared to 6.44 percent for the GNMA fund and 5.90 percent for the
Long-Term Corporate Bond fund and 5.11 percent for Vanguard
Long-Term U.S. Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Why the better yield for the GNMA, which is holds an
intermediate-term portfolio, than for the long-term funds? This is
because a GNMA fund carries an extra element of risk when compared
to traditional bond funds. The Government National Mortgage
Association securities in the GNMA fund portfolio represent bundled
mortgages. Although the government guarantees both principal and
interest payments on these mortgages, the government has no control
over whether the borrowers prepay the mortgages. When interest
rates fall, bond holders in general should be happy. But while the
holders of GNMA funds can see their net asset value rise in times
of moderate rate reductions (or rumors thereof), when there is a
steady and sizable sequence of rate increases, mortgage borrowers
have growing incentive to prepay their mortgages or to refinance
them. When these mortgages are retired, the fund manager then must
go out into the market and replace the holding with new securities.
And in a climate of falling rates, the fund manager who is
replacing GNMA securities end up paying more money to buy
lower-yielding securities _ thus causing the fund's yield to fall.
That effect tends to mitigate the gains that typical bond funds
achieve when interest rates fall.
</P>
<P>
   It's only when you look at the long-term record that the longer
term bond funds come out on top. Of the funds cited above,
Vanguard's Long-Term U.S. Treasury comes out on top, with an
average annual total of 10.80 percent over a 10-year period. The
Long-Term Corporate Bond fund follows, with a 10.49 percent
average, followed by 9.41 percent for the High-Yield Corporate fund
and 8.81 percent for GNMA.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those figures, I still don't like the long bonds. When
you lend money for 20 years or more, you are basically hoping that
inflation will be more or less under control in the future. I don't
think that's a reasonable expectation, so I prefer the
intermediate-term holdings.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have money invested in Columbia mutual funds. How are they
rated in relation to other funds of their size? Are there other
funds that are better? Living here in Oregon, I would like to do my
investing in the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   A.M., Springfield, Ore. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Of Columbia's 11 mutual funds, Morningstar Mutual Funds
tracks nine on a regular basis. Of these nine, five are rated above
average, two are average, one below average, and the final fund is
not rated because it has yet to post three-year records. Moreover,
the fund that's rated below average _ Columbia Special _ is in the
mid-cap growth category, where there are very few winners. (Of the
62 mid-cap growth funds Morningstar tracks, only six merit an
above-average grade, and none get the top five-star rating.) So all
in all, I'd say the Columbia funds get a pretty good report card.
</P>
<P>
   As for a comparison with fund families of similar size, I don't
think such an analysis is worth the effort. First of all, each
individual fund is its own legal entity, so investors shouldn't be
worried about the size of the fund family. And in general, they
need to be concerned about the size of an individual fund only when
it is at one extreme or the other _ very small or very bog. A very
small fund can be disadvantageous because there are fewer investors
to bear the fixed costs of managing the fund. (But fund families
frequently absorb substantial amount of the expenses during the
early years of new funds, and in addition very small funds also
tend to be more nimble investors, and therefore more profitable,
than their rivals.) But there's very little in mitigation when
funds grow giant.
</P>
<P>
   Funds such as Fidelity Magellan or Kaufmann fund have been
regularly criticized for becoming so large that they are unwieldy,
producing substantially lower returns for their investors than when
they were slimmer and held smaller total portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the one benefit that very large funds should be able
to deliver _ lower expenses based on the large asset base _ rarely
seems to materialize. The one category of fund where the investor
doesn't need to worry about the size of the assets under management
is index funds, where fund management is more science than art, and
where expense ratios are, or should be, very low to begin with.)

<P>
   They tell us they do it because they want to keep the other team
guessing.
</P>
<P>
   They say it's to protect their players' privacy.
</P>
<P>
   They swear it's a matter of money _ as in not shifting the odds
for bettors, be they in Las Vegas or the office gambling pool.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, the result is that professional sports
teams regularly mislead the press and public, or at least they
don't own up to the full truth about how hurt their stars are and
how they're being treated. That's what the Patriots did last week
when they kept mum about the pin doctors inserted in Drew Bledsoe's
finger Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The long tradition of deception has gotten to the point where
Americans know more about the polyps scraped out of President
Reagan's colon _ and the way their fathers and brothers are popping
Viagra and Propecia _ than we did about how Bledsoe's doubly
fractured finger was being readied for a game against the St. Louis
Rams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody was betting on how many polyps Ronald Reagan had,''
explains Bob Cousy, the driving force of the Celtics from 1950-63
who is now the team's television analyst. ``In the case of
professional athletes, and especially a key performer such as
Bledsoe, everyone concerned has to take great precautions. They
don't want to exaggerate an injury to alarm the betting public, or
to underplay it, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``The easiest way to deal with it is to give the minimum amount
of information.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is precisely what the Patriots have done with Bledsoe, and
did earlier this season with star receiver Terry Glenn. It's what
the Celtics did for years with Larry Bird and his finicky back,
what the Red Sox did with Roger Clemens's inflamed throwing arm,
and what Bill Parcells did during his Patriots coaching tenure
whenever it suited him. And it's how other pro franchises across
the country typically handle things whenever a critical player
sustains a critical injury.
</P>
<P>
   They say as little as possible. They insist that team doctors do
the same. And they hedge right up until game time or, in Bird's and
Bledsoe's cases, even after the game is under way and they're
playing but it's unclear whether they will return after a break.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it has been done for decades, or at least for the
36 years that Gene Monahan has been around minor and major league
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say it hasn't really changed much,'' says Monahan,
head trainer for the World Series champion New York Yankees. ``In
fact, for the most part, it has been less secretive recently. Head
coaches now are more open and frank with the press.''
</P>
<P>
   Players also have less incentive than before to hide their
injuries, says Dick Johnson, curator of the Sports Museum of New
England: ``Before this age of agents and guaranteed contracts,
players were scared to death that if they told owners they were
hurt, they'd lose their jobs. Willie O'Ree, the first black player
in the National Hockey League, who played for the Bruins, hid the
fact that he'd lost 90 percent of his vision in one eye because of
an injury in junior hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were only 100 players in the NHL then, and he knew if he
told anybody, he'd never receive the opportunity to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty years later, with Bledsoe, it's the team that seems to be
doing the hiding. The Patriots did confirm Friday that their ace
quarterback had a pin inserted in his finger to provide the
stability that a cast and splint had offered in recent weeks, but
they released that information only after it was reported in
Friday's Globe. And they declined to provide further details about
the operation or what it could mean for Bledsoe, offering up only
the National Football League-required information that he's
``probable'' to play and has a finger injury.
</P>
<P>
   Why do teams provide so little?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's strictly strategic,'' says Patrick Sullivan, whose family
used to own the Patriots and who was the team's general manager
from 1983-90. ``If you're St. Louis and you're trying to get ready
for a game, there's a big difference between preparing for a game
with Drew Bledsoe compared to Scott Zolak.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Lowery, spokesman for the Patriots' current owners, agreed:
``Obviously, the less information we share about a particular
injury, the better position it puts us in competitively.''
</P>
<P>
   Gambling is another consideration, much as it has been since
Cousy started playing nearly half a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed Macauley and I would come back to our hotel from Mass on
Sunday morning and some guys with pushed-in noses would be sitting
in lobby chairs watching us,'' Cousy recalls. ``We'd deliberately
limp or put our arms in slings and watch them scatter to the
phones, imagining them calling their bookies telling them we were
injured.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor keeping teams and team doctors from telling all
is recognition of a player's right to the same privacy enjoyed by
other patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unethical to talk about your case to a third person
without your permission,'' says Arnold Scheller, the Celtics'
doctor. ``The athlete is always a patient first.''
</P>
<P>
   True, but others insist that star athletes give up their privacy
rights because they are stars, much the way President Reagan and
other public figures do. That's what most reporters presume and
why, if the team and its doctors won't talk, the press ferrets out
responses from doctors not involved in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``That (ticks) me off,'' says Scheller, who acknowledges that he
occasionally does the same thing when asked about athletes he
hasn't treated. ``What you do is get doctors who enjoy the ego
(gratification) of being asked a question and they'll start running
at the mouth without really knowing the details. That's not
constructive for anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Another downside of professional teams keeping secret their
players' injuries is the example it sets for younger athletes.
``Even at the high school level, teams try to hide the fact that
certain players have an injury,'' says Dr. Lyle Micheli, director
of sports medicine at Children's Hospital in Boston and a
consultant to the NFL Players Association. ``This has all taken on
a new dimension.''
</P>
<P>
   Another argument against teams keeping quiet about injuries is
that it's getting tougher and tougher to keep such secrets,
especially from opponents who have increasingly sophisticated
scouting operations. Bledsoe's surgery eventually leaked out to the
press, and Micheli says it was known even earlier through the
medical grapevine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opposition sure as heck knows he's got a bad finger,''
agrees Milt Schmidt, who learned what it was like playing injured
during his 20 years as a Boston Bruin, during which he was named
the NHL's most valuable player and leading scorer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much difference if the public or opposition
knows,'' adds Hall of Famer Schmidt, now 80. ``And if he has a bad
finger, the team has something to lean on if it loses.''

LIFE, CELEBRITY, AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ED SIEGEL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   as America's passion come full circle? What has been a national
obsession about celebrity is becoming a national obsesssion about
that obsession. It's the subject of Woody Allen's latest movie,
which (like most of his recent movies) is loaded to the gills with
celebrities. It's also the topic, at least in part, of Neil
Gabler's book, ``Life the Movie: How Entertainment Conquered
Reality.'' Even Bret Easton Ellis, of all people, is getting into
the act with his forthcoming novel, ``Glamorama.''
</P>
<P>
   None of this comes a moment too soon, particularly Gabler's
intriguing new book. As we awaken to Washington pundits angling for
elbow room to tell jokes on ``Imus in the Morning'' and fall asleep
to the governor of New York on ``Late Night with David Letterman,''
it seems as if everyone is measuring out his worth in the pursuit
of celebrityhood, which becomes a more and more trivial pursuit
with each passing day.
</P>
<P>
   That's something of the message in Allen's movie, which is
certainly not among his best but does represent a huge improvement
over his self-pitying earlier movie on the subject, ``Stardust
Memories.'' Here, celebrity is a dead-end pursuit, leading the
protagonist from one bedroom to another with nothing to show for it
but a cinematic cry for help. (Ironically, his wife gets all the
goodies that celebrity confers, without even trying for such
status.)
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Branagh plays the protagonist caught in his own private
Inferno, a character many viewers assume is Allen. Interestingly,
Allen tried directing Branagh away from playing him, but the
British star apparently couldn't help himself. We play the parts
that celebrities play, even in the movies.
</P>
<P>
   Gabler takes that thesis and runs with it gracefully in ``Life
the Movie,'' noting how the heroic archetype in Joseph Campbell's
``The Hero With a Thousand Faces'' has become the celebrity
archetype of today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Campbell's archetype addressed fears extant in all societies:
the anxiety of separation; the terror of the unknown; the dread of
forces larger than ourselves; death. The celebrity archetype
addressed social fears extant in modern America: the anxiety of
losing one's identity or never finding it at all; the terror of
having too little amid plenty; the dread of anonymity; the awful
suspicion that some were blessed and some were not and that most
Americans were among the latter.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking to popular culture for our heroes is nothing new. It was
striking to be reminded, after Frank Sinatra died, how many men of
a certain generation modeled themselves on the way he wore his hat,
to quote the title of Bill Zehme's book (subtitled ``Frank Sinatra
&AMP; the Lost Art of Livin' ''). Or as Pete Hamill writes in ``Why
Sinatra Matters,'' recalling a meeting in 1970: ``For decades now,
Sinatra had defined the glamour of the urban night. It was both a
time and a place; to inhabit the night, to be one of its restless
creatures, was a small act of defiance, a shared declaration of
freedom, a refusal to play by all those conventional rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Later generations would model themselves on other pop-culture
celebrities, looking for swagger wherever they found it, from Elvis
to Michael Stipe, from Norman Mailer to Bruce Willis. I asked a
friend what female pop-culture icons she grew up wanting to emulate
in the 1960s and her first response was Fess Parker's wife in
``Daniel Boone'' because she was the spunkiest woman on television.
She called a friend who said Paul McCartney's wife. Girls had to
get their heroes from books, like Anne Frank and Nancy Drew. Is it
a sign of progress that girls can stop reading books and find
heroes of their own in pop culture, from Buffy to Oprah?
</P>
<P>
   The real question, though, is whether celebrity is the place
where any of us should be getting our heroes, and perhaps books
like Gabler's and movies like Allen's represent a sense that we're
looking for a source of strength and identity in all the wrong
places.
</P>
<P>
   In noting the similarities between mythic heroes and celebrity
heroes, Gabler cites Campbell as saying, ``In the end it has been
the (mythic hero's) function to show us the continuity between the
natural world outside us and the spiritual world within.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's precisely what the overwhelming majority of celebrity
heroes don't do, even one possessed of the artistry of Sinatra. In
a perceptive review of ``Why Sinatra Matters,'' Christopher
Lehmann-Haupt pays tribute to Hamill's ability to prove the point
of the title. He notes Hamill's observation, ``The message was
there in the music, the attitude, even the hat: he had come through
a hard, dark time, and he wasn't ever going back into the
darkness.'' But Lehmann-Haupt offers this important objection:
``The darkness being women, presumably. This is not a message
worthy of high art. In Mr. Hamill's handling at least, those wee
small hours of the morning are a landscape of adolescence.''
</P>
<P>
   Branagh's cry for help at the end of Allen's movie is at least
in part a cry for help at being stuck in perpetual adolescence,
which is ultimately the destination of a celebrity-transfixed
nation. ``Imus in the Morning'' is nothing if not a codification of
the adolescence of the national political dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   The mythic heroes that Campbell was writing about take us out of
adolescence, which is why we were all probably better off when we
had to turn to books for our heroes, who _ chief among their
responsibilities _ led us from childhood to adulthood. The cult of
celebrity can be a lot of fun, but in the end it's really nothing
more than child's play.

A NOT SO COLORFUL `BLUE ROOM' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ED SIEGEL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Those Brits really do have to get out more often. The
way the men who run their media and many of their male theater
critics drooled over Nicole Kidman in ``The Blue Room,'' you'd
think they had never seen an actress bare her bottom onstage
before. Apparently everything we've heard about repressed Englismen
is true.
</P>
<P>
   So gaga did they go that ``The Blue Room'' is now here for a
three-month stay and Kidman is on the cover of ``Newsweek,'' which
says this is the hottest ticket for a nonmusical in Broadway
history.
</P>
<P>
   The hype may all underline the point of David Hare's adaptation
of Arthur Schnitzler's ``La Ronde'' _ that sex makes the world go
ronde. It certainly proves that audiences will do anything to
experience eroticism, even vicariously.
</P>
<P>
   But was it good for me, too? Not really. And to judge from the
respectful but relatively tepid response at Friday night's preview
performance, I'm sure I'm not the only person to wonder what the
big deal is about. Don't get me wrong; I wouldn't kick Kidman out
of my theater company. She's a fine actress and the other virtues,
the ones that sent Rupert Murdoch and the other Fleet Street boys
into a frenzy, are apparent for all to see.
</P>
<P>
   But ``The Blue Room'' is essentially a mediocre play and a
mediocre theatrical experience. Hare has written a lackluster
contemporization of Schnitzler's now classic turn-of-the-century
play, and Sam Mendes has directed it with the same cynical
detachment and soulless sexuality that marks his other hugely
successful London transfer, ``Cabaret.''
</P>
<P>
   The twist in this adaptation is that two actors, Kidman and Iain
Glen, play all the roles called for in Schnitzler's play. Kidman
starts out as a teenage hooker looking for sex and hoping for money
with Glen as a self-impressed taxi driver.
</P>
<P>
   In the next scene he seduces an au pair who then connects with
the young man in the house, and on and on until we've come full
circle back to the teenage hooker, now a little less naive. Using
the same two actors underscores how we're driven by the same urges,
across class and age lines.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind the contemporization seems to be that for all
the changes in this century, we're still the same as our Victorian
predecessors, denying the power that sex holds over our lives on
the one hand, but proving otherwise with every step we take on the
other. Again, the success of ``The Blue Room'' would seem to bear
out the wisdom of the thesis with hordes on both sides of the
Atlantic lining up for a peep show disguised as a night in the
theater.
</P>
<P>
   That in itself isn't cause for alarm, unless you're a member of
the House Judiciary Committee. The problem is there's nothing
special here, about the peep or anything else. First of all, it's
still Hare's responsibility to show that the more things change the
more they stay the same, that we're all still prisoners of our
Freudian passions despite our moralistic protestations. But in
updating the action, the characters don't seem terribly
contemporary. They're prefeminist souls in postfeminist posings.
That is, many of them still possess the longings of Schnitzler's
characters to hold onto a Romantic vision of love rather than
accept a more Modernistic sensibility. Unlike Patrick Marber's
``Closer,'' though, these characters seem caught up in a time warp
where women are all powerless and men are all predators posing,
even to themselves, as romantics. That might have been prescient of
Schnitzler to note in 1900 and fashionable for theater of, say, the
1970s, to develop, but these characters now seem to provide a
seriously simplistic and outdated model for human behavior. Hare
got well past such reductionism in ``Skylight.''
</P>
<P>
   That these characters aren't easy to bond with has nothing to do
with the considerable talents of the two actors. Glen and Kidman
have an easy chemistry between them even if there's really not that
much of an erotic charge onstage. (There is an electric charge,
though. Each sex scene is blacked out, with a crackling monitor
announcing length of duration.) Kidman projects the innocence that
sets the hearts of Hare's men aflutter, and she is an extremely
gifted comedian who proves in one outing that she can play a
variety of roles. Glen carries himself like a young Ian McKellen as
he goes from part to part, from swaggering cabdriver to fuddy-duddy
aristocrat.
</P>
<P>
   Still, what marks ``The Blue Room'' is the sheer unremarkability
of anything onstage. Not only are ``Skylight'' and ``Closer'' far
more compelling and articulate stagings of a similar debate, but
Kidman's is not even the most dazzling performance by an overseas
actress on Broadway (Zoe Wanamaker in the decidely unsexy
``Electra''). Kidman doesn't even have the best nude scene onstage,
as Glen literally does cartwheels to make people notice how he's
letting it all hang out. But if bare bodies are really what you're
after, Runway 69 is still around the corner in Times Square and
probably a whole lot cheaper. (I, of course, wouldn't know.)
</P>
<P>
   Mark Thompson's staging may be more creative at the Cort
Theatre, with changes of scenery fed into the claustrophobic blue
room where sex is the only thing that matters. Hare's sense of
humor is certainly working, particularly in self-referential
scenes. Kidman plays an actress, chastizing her lover for not
displaying the same ardor as the men in the audience _ ``Every
night I feel them out there pulsing, vibrating, wanting to rise out
of their seats and have me.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, perhaps we do, but Hare's and Mendes's staging makes it
very easy to contain ourselves about everything in ``The Blue
Room.''

`MADELINE' IS FAMILY FUN; `LETHAL WEAPON 4' SO-SO

<P>
   NEW RELEASES: ``Madeline'' _ This live-action version of the
French schoolgirl's adventures retains the impish qualities of the
original stories. Wonderfully cast and exquisitely produced, this
one is a great holiday film for the entire family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lethal Weapon 4'' _ Aren't Mel Gibson and Danny Glover getting
a little long in the tooth for this sort of action series? The
acting is predictable, the stunts acceptable, and it does mark the
screen debut of comic Chris Rock, but there's little to recommend
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Halloween H20'' _ Why don't they just take Freddie Krueger of
``Elm Street,'' Jason of ``Friday the 13th,'' and Michael Myers of
this series into a nuclear waste dump? Jamie Lee Curtis is back,
some 20 years after John Carpenter's original, but that's not
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Strauss Family'' _ Great music provided by the London
Symphony Orchestra, but the family is reduced to palatable
stereotypes in this overwrought melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indiscreet'' _ Not to be confused with the Hitchcock film,
this one stars Adam Baldwin, Luke Perry, and Gloria Reuben as a
treacherous triangle. Same-old, same-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Christmas Story'' _ Bob Clark's terrific film based on Jean
Shepherd's tales of growing up Midwestern takes its place alongside
more traditional Christmas films. Funny, touching, and smart.

   !!! 1/2 ``A Simple Plan'' A dark, impressively crafted morality
fable. Farm-town brothers Bill Paxton and Billy Bob Thornton (and
the latter's redneck sidekick, Brent Briscoe) find a duffel bag of
dirty money that creates as many problems as it solves. Terrific
acting and primal foreboding in this starkly rendered stretch for
all involved, including director Sam Raimi. (R)

that Bruce was done in by political forces dedicated to the status

such predecessors as ``Local Hero'' and ``Tight Little Island''

   Forty-five years ago, 17-year-old Jerry Leiber showed up at
17-year-old Mike Stoller's door with a pad full of song lyrics.
That afternoon, they started writing songs together. And they've
been at it ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the short list: ``Hound Dog'' for Big Mama Thornton.
``Jailhouse Rock,'' ``Love Me Tender,'' ``Loving You,'' and ``Treat
Me Nice'' for Elvis Presley. ``Spanish Harlem'' and ``Stand By Me''
for Ben E. King. ``There Goes My Baby'' and ``On Broadway'' for the
Drifters. ``Yakety Yak,'' ``Poison Ivy,'' ``Charlie Brown,'' and
``Searchin' '' for the Coasters. ``Is That All There Is?'' for
Peggy Lee. ``I'll Be There'' for Gerry and the Pacemakers. ``D. W.
Washburn'' for the Monkees. ``Ruby Baby'' for Dion.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just a hint at what they've produced over nearly five
decades years of work.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, that work gets another celebration when the
Broadway hit ``Smokey Joe's Cafe: The Songs of Leiber and Stoller''
opens at the Shubert Theatre for a 2 1/2-week run.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first called Mike he didn't give me a helluva lot of
encouragement,'' said Leiber, now 62, of that California afternoon
in 1953. ``I got his name from a drummer but Mike wasn't
interested. I twisted his arm and talked him into letting me come
over. I was just 17 and I showed up with my notebook with 10 or 15
lyrics written in pencil. He really dug Miles Davis, Charlie
Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, and all the great bebop musicians. And I
was into the blues _ Jimmy Witherspoon, John Lee Hooker, Memphis
Slim. He smiled at me as if he thought he was placating me and, in
a semi-patronizing manner, asked if he could take a look at the
book. `These aren't songs,' he said. `These are the blues. You
write the blues. Man, I love the blues.' That's what started it
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Their first big hit was Thornton's version of ``Hound Dog''
(1953), which sold 125,000 copies and topped rhythm and blues
playlists for months. Three years later, Presley's version sold 7
million copies. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Big Mama's `Hound Dog' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of my favorites,'' said Stoller, in another phone
interview from Los Angeles. ``The Big Mama Thornton version with
our lyrics.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of ``Hound Dog'' is a model of how talent and
serendipity merged into a fortuitous hit back in rock 'n' roll's
infancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew Johnny Otis, a drummer and band leader who made
records for Big Mama Thornton, Little Esther, Three Tons of Joy,
and Mel Williams,'' recalled Leiber. ``Big Mama wore overalls and
she was big . . . and tough. She had razor scars on her face and
she had a piano player named Lady Dee who had arms like Popeye's.
She was a lot of trouble. When we first showed up, we left without
leaving any songs. But, on the way back, in Mike's '37 Plymouth, I
started beating out rhythm with my right hand. It was a variation
of a buck dance.''
</P>
<P>
   And Leiber started singing, ``You ain't nothin' but a . . . '
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted it to be a very blue song,'' Leiber continued, ``so I
threw in `hound dog' as a dummy lyric until I could think of
something else. Hound dog sounded too prissy. I wanted something
dirty. We got to his house and we didn't even sit down. He went to
the piano and banged out the tune and we had the song done in 10 or
12 minutes. We drove back to South Central . . . to Johnny Otis's
place and handed the paper with the song on it to Big Mama. She was
snide and patronizing because we were two white boys writing the
blues. She started crooning . . . like it was a love song.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Mama, that ain't the way it goes,' I said.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Why don't you tell me how it goes, white boy,' she said.
Johnny came up to see what was going on. `This little white boy
wants to show me how it goes,' she said.
</P>
<P>
   `` `You let him,' Johnny told her. `You let him tell you how it
goes.' He was imitating her.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, I did it. A bluesy version that had the band clapping in
their own way. `I like that,' Big Mama said. `Yeah, I like that.'
Three days later we recorded it and that was that.''
</P>
<P>
   Not quite. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Elvis version &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In late 1955, Elvis Presley was strolling through a casino
lounge (neither Leiber nor Stoller recalls which one) when he heard
Freddie Bell and the Bell Boys, a white band, performing their
version of Big Mama's hit. Because the original lyrics were written
for a woman, Bell had rewritten a couple of lines.
</P>
<P>
   Big Mama sang, ``You ain't nothin' but a hound dog, don't come
sniffin' 'round my door. You ain't nothin' but a hound dog, I ain't
gonna feed you no more.''
</P>
<P>
   Freddie Bell sang, ``You ain't nothin' but a hound dog, cryin'
all the time. You ain't never caught a rabbit, and you ain't no
friend of mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Presley, unfortunately, recorded the latter.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1956, Mike Stoller was returning from a European trip on
a luxury liner, unaware that Presley had recorded the song.
</P>
<P>
   `I had no idea who Elvis was,'' said Stoller. ``I remember,
after we docked, Jerry telling me that it was a huge hit _ but,
frankly, that's not what made the trip memorable.''
</P>
<P>
   What did make the trip unforgettable for Stoller is that he was
aboard the legendary Andrea Doria, the ship that sank after a
collision with a freighter. He escaped in a life boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I was a bit numb. I was just glad to be back on terra
firma,'' said Stoller. ``Elvis or no Elvis.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Leiber and Stoller prefer Thornton's version of the song
anyway (and in ``Smokey Joe's Cafe,'' it's the original that the
cast sings). As Leiber put it, Presley's cover is ``a nervous,
hyped-up version. There's a lot of things wrong with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Their relationship with Elvis led to a contract with MGM to
write the songs for Presley's 1957 feature, ``Jailhouse Rock,''
directed by Richard Thorpe, best known for making ``The Student
Prince'' with Mario Lanza.
</P>
<P>
   According to Leiber, they checked into the Gotham Hotel in New
York and were given about 10 days to come up with the eight to 10
songs required for a soundtrack. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Four songs in four hours &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``But New York was Mike's town. He grew up there,'' said Leiber.
``And he wanted to show me the town. We spent days and nights going
to clubs and not getting any work done. It was very exciting and we
really got caught up in it. One day there's a knock on the door and
it's Jean Aberbach, a Bavarian, who published all of Elvis's music.
He was a very big guy. He was very polite but he wanted his songs.
We told him we couldn't write nine songs in one afternoon, even
though we often wrote five in one day. He needed the score that
afternoon. We told him he could have it that night. He was very
firm. He pushed the sofa against the door and laid down on it and
put his hat over his head like he was some kind of gangster in a
pool hall.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1 and 5 that afternoon, Leiber and Stoller wrote
``Jailhouse Rock,'' ``Treat Me Nice,'' ``I Want to be Free'' and
``Baby, I Don't Care.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That bought us more time to come up with the rest of the
songs,'' said Leiber.
</P>
<P>
   For most of their careers, Leiber and Stoller functioned as both
songwriters and record producers, gathering the talent, selecting
the bands, creating the arrangements, and making sure the record
got a good send-off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did the same with this show,'' said Leiber. ``We worked
with the band and the performers to get the right color and rhythm.
It's a whole different kettle of fish. We don't have Ben E. King
singing `Stand By Me' _ he does it great, but he can't dance or
move around; he stands in front of a microphone. This is theater.
We have a terrific cast. We're just very lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   One more question.
</P>
<P>
   Why is it always Leiber-Stoller and not Stoller-Leiber?
</P>
<P>
   ``For a while it went back and forth,'' said Stoller. ``But we
finally settled on Leiber-Stoller. What did he say?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Leiber-Stoller sounds better,'' said Leiber. It's got rhythm.
It swings.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's still swinging after all these years.

<HEADLINE>
VIETNAM CREATED A NEW JOURNALISM FOR A NEW KIND OF WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every war is unhappy in its own way. Vietnam was especially so,
and one of the principal ways it became unhappy was through
journalism.
</P>
<P>
   With some exceptions _ the War of 1812, the Mexican War _
American journalists gladly enlisted in the country's wars,
fighting with their typewriters, rallying the home front, battling
to keep the fighting spirit alive and high. Then came Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam changed much in American culture: public respect for
professional soldiers, the broad assumption that the nation's
leaders spoke the truth to the people, the orthodoxy that our wars
are just, the notion that when the United States fights a war, it
wins it crisply, unambiguously, and honorably.
</P>
<P>
   But no institution in American life, not even the military, was
changed by the Vietnam War as profoundly as journalism. The ancient
craft entered the war with a wink and emerged with a scowl. Its
practitioners entered the war with skepticism and left with
cynicism. Its best-known names entered the war as mere observers of
great power and left the war wielders of great power.
</P>
<P>
   And so the appearance of an anthology of Vietnam journalism, in
two elegant volumes of the Library of America, is a landmark. But
it is also a recognition of how journalism changed that war and,
just as important, how that war changed journalism. In 1,715 pages
of writing that remains remarkably resilient _ still gripping after
all these years _ the full tragedy of Vietnam is visible, audible,
palpable, along with the whirr of the helicopter rotors and the
spit of the M-16 rifles and the tears of the families of the 58,000
American dead.
</P>
<P>
   These are volumes that can be dipped into, skimmed _ or read
slowly, page after page, one volume following another. Any way will
do, and any way will leave the reader with a richer view of
Vietnam. But the very best way to read these volumes is to
accompany them with the two volumes the Library of America
published three years ago, ``Reporting World War II'' (also $35 a
volume). The World War II volumes add 1,900 pages of reading, to be
sure, but they also add an immensely valuable perspective.
</P>
<P>
   One example is especially searing. In Tunisia in World War II,
Ernie Pyle looked back upon the men who perished in the ferocious
fighting of 1943 and wrote: ``They died and thereby the rest of us
can go on and on. When we leave here for the next shore, there is
nothing we can do for the ones beneath the wooden crosses, except
perhaps to pause and murmur, `Thanks, pal.' ''
</P>
<P>
   No reader would ever mistake that passage for one written about
Vietnam, which was simultaneously an overseas military conflict and
a domestic political one.
</P>
<P>
   Then consider how these two wars began, and how journalism
responded. The run-up to World War II was freighted with tension,
and the reporting that endured _ from William L. Shirer, Dorothy
Thompson, A. J. Liebling, Edward R. Murrow, among many _ was
ominous in its tone, unmistakable in its underlying assumption: The
National Socialism of Hitler's Germany was evil, it was destined to
cause conflict, and America was destined to become involved, and
should.
</P>
<P>
   The beginnings in Vietnam, too, were full of warning, but the
blasts were of a far different nature. As early as January 1961,
for example, Stanley Karnow was writing of the South Vietnam
government that was America's ally: ``Beneath the appearance of
calm and stability, and despite all the government's assurances of
security, President (Ngo Dinh) Diem's regime may well be
approaching collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 13 months later, Homer Bigart, whose coverage of World War
II was far less political, sounded a tocsin in The New York Times
that wasn't heeded: ``The United States seems inextricably
committed to a long, inconclusive war. The Communists can prolong
it for years. Even without large-scale intervention from the north
. . . what may be achieved at best is only restoration of a
tolerable security similar to that achieved in Malaya after years
of fighting. But it is too late to disengage; our prestige has been
committed. Washington says we will stay until the finish.''
</P>
<P>
   Karnow and Bigart weren't alone, far from it. The alarm bells
were sounding all over the landscape, even in the pages of the
Saturday Evening Post, never suspected of pink ideology. In a July
1962 interview with Bernard B. Fall, the North Vietnamese leader Ho
Chi Minh said: ``I think the Americans greatly underestimate the
determination of the Vietnamese people. The Vietnamese people
always have shown great determination when they were faced with a
foreign invader.''
</P>
<P>
   As US involvement escalated, as domestic support eroded, and as
the biggest indigenous antiwar movement in US history grew, all
these elements became clearer. But it was a mistake then, and is
now, to believe that the elements of American failure in Vietnam
became clear only in 1966 and 1967 and 1968, when opposition to the
war broadened and deepened. Those elements were known, and
publicized, from the very start.
</P>
<P>
   But if the war was sustained by myths, then its course in the
popular mind is shrouded also in myth.
</P>
<P>
   Journalism has severe limits as a craft, and even more severe
ones as a chronicle of history; in almost every case, the
historian's view of events is more interesting, more thoughtful,
and more enduring than the reporter's. (Compare, for example, how
historians view two of the signal events of this century _ the
causes of the Great Depression and the causes of World War II _
with the way reporters viewed them, and the chasm is clear.) But
journalism is a reminder that the myths of history also sometimes
have to be swept away. In the Vietnam era, that is especially so.
Two examples, drawn from coverage of two completely different
aspects of the war years:
</P>
<P>
   --By plowing through a portrait of the first teach-in, at the
University of Michigan, we are reminded of the passion of the
antiwar movement. We are reminded, too, that some of the passion
was stirred by the energies of young people living in a world we
hardly remember. For example, protests were sexually integrated in
ways that many other campus activities weren't. Here is the account
from the Michigan Daily: ``Women were allowed all-night permission
to attend the teach-in and as Jared Stammel, '68, remarked, `This
undoubtedly gave a big stimulus to the event.' ''
</P>
<P>
   --By rereading the remarkable reporting by Seymour M. Hersh of
the massacre at My Lai, we are reminded of the sense of innocence
Americans had about themselves and about their war as late as
November 1969. In the two volumes' 1,700-odd pages, perhaps the
most memorable single sentence comes from the mother of one of the
GIs at the village: ``I sent them a good boy and they made him a
murderer.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many memorable moments in these volumes, including the
account by John McCain, now a Republican US senator from Arizona,
of being shot down ``right in the center of Hanoi'' in 1963, being
charged with being a war criminal, being beaten and forced to live
in brutal solitary confinement; the writing of Norman Mailer at one
of the domestic battles of the war, Chicago in 1968, and of Tom
Wolfe, who caught the great tension between the war at home and the
one in Vietnam; the account of Doris Kearns (now Goodwin) of how
President Johnson chose the bombing targets and felt the great
frustration of the war; and the graceful writing of H. D. S.
Greenway, now the editor of the editorial page of this newspaper,
whose unforgettable account of a night with the Viet Cong began:
``At night in the Mekong River Delta, pale lights bob and flicker
like fireflies through the banana trees and over the rice paddies,
dry in the harvest now and white in the moonlight.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a war as brutal as World War II, and in an era when
many Americans' views about World War II come from Spielberg, it is
worthwhile to remember the brutality of the war that came two
decades later. Listen to Jack P. Smith, who was wounded at Landing
Zone Albany in the Ia Drang Valley in 1965, and who now is an ABC
correspondent: ``This was a massacre, and I was one of a handful
not yet wounded. All around me, those who were not already dead
were dying or severely wounded, most of them hit several times. I
must have been talking a lot, but I have no idea what I was saying.
It think it was, `Oh, God, Oh, God, Oh God,' over and over. Then I
would cry.''
</P>
<P>
   But the standards were different in Vietnam. The New York
Times's fabled Sydney H. Schanberg quotes an Air Force general
saying, ``We wiped out whole cities, whole cities, in World War II,
and there wasn't a single protest. Now one bomb falls outside the
target area and they scream in righteous moral indignation.''
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam was, like most wars, the extension of politics by other
means. And at the heart of the struggle over the war was a complex
generational conflict between the wise old men, many with
worldviews rooted in World War II, and the young wise guys, whose
worldview was rooted in the gritty war in Vietnam. The old men were
Omar Bradley, Douglas Dillon, Matthew Ridgway, and Dean Acheson.
The young guys were David Halberstam, Malcom W. Browne, Neil
Sheehan, and Charles Mohr.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the wise young guys won the argument and won over
the Wise Old Men. It was, for better or for worse, the triumph of
journalism.

<P>
   The men assumed it was a fluke. But when the detector kept
responding to the site _ and none other _ they began to dig the
soil with their hands.
</P>
<P>
   And there, just inches beneath the surface, were the coins _
``big, small, many,'' Senturk recalled. ``Ibrahim was shouting, `We
are rich! We are rich!' And I said, let's go to the police. If we
give it to them, they will give us a percentage.''
</P>
<P>
   Basbug kissed his friend on the cheek with excitement. ``Nobody
will hear about it,'' he told Senturk. ``It will be quiet. Even the
roosters in Istanbul won't be heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Senturk drove to Basbug's house, where they stayed up until
dawn, counting and washing off some 1,900 coins. The next day,
Basbug and Sungur drove to the port city of Antalya to get them
appraised, Senturk said. When two pieces sold for about $200 each,
they began to realize what they had; Basbug and Sungur flew to
Istanbul, tracking down a well-connected smuggler, Fuat Aydiner, in
the Grand Bazaar, to unload the rest.
</P>
<P>
   But the discoverers' fortunes soon began to reverse. After the
sale in Istanbul, two of the peasants were arrested by police
acting on a tip. Basbug, Senturk said, had spent the windfall on an
alcoholic binge, during which he stood in the middle of the street
and shouted, ``We are the three richest men in Turkey!'' He then
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him (after he was caught two years later), `Is this
the rooster that nobody would hear?' '' Senturk recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Senturk and Sungur were tried and convicted. Senturk spent a
year in jail, and spent the following decade ``getting better''
after the ordeal. But he did not forget the coins: Last year,
Senturk testified in preparation for the Turkish lawsuit, examining
200 photographs of Koch's coins.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt in my mind that these coins are among the
coins that we dug up in the field,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By the time the peasants were caught, the hoard had been
launched on its international journey, slipping across the border
of Turkey into Germany, and ultimately into the hands of American
numismatists who knew how extraordinary it was, according to
documents filed in Boston federal court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of the King Tut of numismatic discoveries,'' said
Thomas Hoving, former director of the Metropolitan Museum in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Aydiner, the Istanbul smuggler, had spent more than $500,000 on
the hoard, a relative pittance, especially for a cache that
included 13 rare Athenian decadrachms, of which there are only 30
in the world, and the other 1,000 Lycian coins.
</P>
<P>
   Aydiner then nearly doubled the price, reselling it to a group
of renowned smugglers in Munich _ including Edip Telliagaoglu, a
convict nicknamed ``blind Edip,'' who had a forbidding reputation,
according to court papers.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Turkish officials allege, when the dealers started
peddling the hoard around Europe, their dodgy backgrounds failed to
dissuade one erudite buyer: Jeffrey Spier, then an archeology PhD
candidate at Oxford University. He flew to Munich, setting in
motion a purchase that Turkish officials say became part of his
doctoral thesis _ and, ultimately, spurred the long dispute.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing the coins, court documents allege, Spier called
Jonathan Kagan, a friend who graduated a year behind him at
Harvard, in 1978. Kagan, also a classics enthusiast and a director
at the investment firm Lazard Freres, then mentioned the potential
purchase to a man who could afford the valuable prize: William
Koch.
</P>
<P>
   Koch would eventually become a fixture of flamboyance in
Massachusetts, annoying his neighbors on Cape Cod with helicopter
traffic, publicly evicting his mistress from his luxury condo, and
battling the state for what is believed to be the biggest tax
refund in history, $47.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   But conscientiousness was not his trademark even in 1984,
Turkish officials allege. After agreeing to buy into the
collection, Koch had it authenticated by Vermeule, an equally
idiosyncratic character known for his fluency in seven languages
and razor-sharp memory.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, in July, 1984, Vermeule received a letter
from Silvia Hurter, a manager at Bank Leu in Switzerland, who said
Turkish authorities were reportedly looking for the illegally
smuggled hoard. One month later, according to court documents,
Vermeule sent an official letter telling Koch not to worry. He
apparently took the advice.
</P>
<P>
   Yet other reasons for concern started cropping up. Almost
immediately after the sale, Koch and his partners decided they had
been cheated, and sued the Munich dealers for pieces that were
withheld. Then, in 1986, Acar, heard about the alleged smuggling
operation and began working on a story.
</P>
<P>
   Other collectors were becoming suspicious. Bruce McNall, the
former owner of the Los Angeles Kings, had put 10 pieces up for
sale; he returned them to Turkey in 1988 when their origins were
questioned.
</P>
<P>
   The same year, court papers said, Vermeule wrote to Koch: ``It
would be wise to let dust settle before exhibiting the coins. One
doesn't want a process server from the Turkish Embassy's New York
lawyers!''
</P>
<P>
   Turkey filed suit in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Koch and his partners deny their coins those unearthed by
Senturk. By their account, Spier first saw his coins on Feb. 22,
1984, two months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   And in an interview last week, Vermeule also denied the disputed
coins could have come from Turkey _ despite the warnings he issued
to Koch in 1984 and 1988. He also said the letter from Hurter was
about a hoard ``that may well not be Mr. Koch's coins.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether that argument will succeed will be determined in court.
In the meantime, according to Ricardo J. Elia, associate archeology
professor at Boston University, the loser is the community at
large.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like taking a history book and ripping out the pages,''
Elia said. ``Turkey is responsible for protecting all these
centuries of history within its borders. Who else is supposed to
protect it?''

A GOP EXERCISE IN MOB JUSTICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- At the moment of truth, the Impeachment Party has
served up the Mike Espy case in doubly disgusting form, repackaged
for a pseudo-Constitutional stage. That's the best light available
for an exercise in dumbed-down mob justice.
</P>
<P>
   More harshly, it's Andrew Johnson Lite, an attempt by one
political party to separate House impeachment from Senate trial and
removal from office, thus unconstitutionally shredding the Founding
Fathers' design for a double-barreled protection against abuse of
presidential powers.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment of truth, moving onto the House floor this week,
the Espy and Johnson Lite bastardizations of the constitution have
actually merged, illegally into an illegitimate hybrid.In public
now, the House's de facto leader, Majority Whip Tom DeLay of Texas,
can only arrange a tiny majority for impeachment by selling it to
undecided Republicans as something else.
</P>
<P>
   In the open, he and his allies are candidly calling impeachment
censure, transforming it from a constitutional protection of the
country into a partisan, punishment message.And in private, DeLay
and his allies are trying to arrange their tiny majority by telling
House members two even more constitutionally illegitimate tales:
</P>
<P>
   --You don't have to be convinced of President Clinton's guilt of
anything. You're simply the equivalent of a grand juror or inquest
participant looking for probable cause to ``send it to the Senate''
for trial. In flagrant contravention of the standards of the
Judiciary Committee chairman of Watergate fame, Peter Rodino,
current chairman Henry Hyde is DeLay's messenger.
</P>
<P>
   --There won't be any big trial in the Senate anyway, most likely
none at all. It will be halted somehow and either censure will
ensue there or your impeachment vote will stand as Clinton's
punishment. On a pseudo-constitutional stage, the ``prosecutors''
of the president are asserting that the ``indictment'' is in effect
punitive as opposed to accusatory. At least in the discredited case
against former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, the equally
discredited independent counsel, Donald Smaltz, had the sense to
withhold his extra-legal remarks until after he had lost the trial.
</P>
<P>
   But like the Espy case, this one depends upon a prosecutor's
narrative and theory that is unsupported by his own witnesses _
from Monica Lewinsky's concept of sex to Betty Currie's explicit
denial that she was pressured to say something false.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Starr and David Schippers could make headlines by telling
stories, spiced by selected quotes from uncross-examined grand jury
witnesses. But they cannot try the case in public, and Hyde can't
try the case before the Senate, because their witnesses contradict
each other and the prosecutors' theories.The only exception _
enshrined in first impeachment article _ would involve using Ms.
Lewinsky to allege sexual details her damaged credibility could
never establish in a normal trial.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Starr and Schippers used inference, narrative, and
invective to make cases their witnesses don't. That is why Hyde
contravened another Rodino principle from Watergate and called no
fact witnesses during his four-month process to resolve
contradictions and test the strength of contested grand jury
statements. That is why even the articles of impeachment on perjury
do not specify the actual statements considered perjurious, and
would be dismissed in a second for vagueness in a normal case.
</P>
<P>
   And that's where Andrew Johnson Lite comes to the rescue. One
hundred and 30 years ago, the radical Republicans of the post-Civil
War era set a policy as opposed to perjury trap for Lincoln's
successor; the House sprang it by voting his impeachment even
before they bothered to draft the articles.So rabidly partisan was
that bunch that they thought conviction by the Senate would be
equally preordained, but seven gutsy Republicans eventually stood
in the way.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the variation is that partisan impeachment by the House
can suffice and avoid the embarassment of failing to produce
credible evidence at a trial.
</P>
<P>
   As Representative Bill Delahunt, one of the few who has tried to
reach across party lines and is a leading censure player, put it,
the result is an extra-legal change in the Constitution to remake
``impeachment as a routine punishment for presidents who fall short
of our expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's more.
</P>
<P>
   Cowering under an expiring independent counsel law, the House
has abrogated its constitutional responsibility to exercise the
sole power of impeachment. It has simply received, publicized, and
rewritten the work of Starr, an employee of another branch.And its
leaders seek impeachment without proof of guilt on the expectation
that trial in the Senate can neither succeed nor is even likely to
occur.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny margin in favor that might be arranged next week will
be more than covered by the number of pro-impeachment Republicans
who will be replaced by anti-impeachment Democrats in a matter of
days.If that isn't illegitimate, the word has no meaning. At the
moment of truth, the punishment will become, not fit, the alleged
crime.

GETTING READY FOR THE APOCALYPSE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Kathy Branstetter co-runs an on-line
conversation conference on earthquakes for The Well, a
Sausalito-based computer service. Lately it's been buzzing with
stories and advice about the stuff you need to survive a good
shaking or Y2King.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conference gets unusually quiet, and suddenly there's a
little tremor and everybody's strolling through.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently her conference was renamed the ``earthquake and other
catastrophe conference.''
</P>
<P>
   Combine a quake with a tornado, a blackout and the predicted
mini-apocalypse of the Y2K computer glitch, and suddenly a lot of
people are checking their battery supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are coming in and asking what they need,'' said Stan
Deorian, manager of the Earthquake Outlet in Emeryville, which
sells everything from first-aid kits to chemical toilets.
``Basically, you need food, water, medical supplies, flashlights
and light sticks.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said, ``There are those who get more prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   You survivalists know who you are. You're the ones who can't get
the spare tire out of the trunk of your car because of all the
emergency gear.
</P>
<P>
   In the San Francisco area, survivalists don't wear fatigues.
Kathleen Maxwell is a tastefully dressed art historian who wants to
buy a motorcycle _ not for the image, but to escape San Francisco
when the Big One comes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city will burn, and we won't be able to get out of town,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   She already has two metal garbage cans filled with supplies _
including a radio, flashlights, batteries, clothing, walking shoes,
a crowbar, bleach to purify the gallons of water she keeps
elsewhere, a little stove and Hefty bags ``for yucky things.''
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell is serious about her emergency preparedness. ``How far
can you go on a motorcycle's tank of gas?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband Paul Maxwell has the opposite preparedness
personality type. ``I just have a small bottle of water from
Lourdes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Spoofing his wife, he said, ``I can't divulge the details, but
we're building a small nuclear reactor.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most people in the area, I'm somewhere between a
survivalist and a guy who can't find the flashlight.
</P>
<P>
   After the '89 earthquake, we stocked the house with water and
cases of canned food. Gradually, the chili and Dinty Moore
disappeared due to dinnertime laziness.
</P>
<P>
   The batteries ran down, but the Pacific Gas and Electric Co.
thoughtfully reminded us they had by providing us with blackouts.
</P>
<P>
   We've never fully restocked our earthquake supplies, but the
trunk of the car is unusable because of the clutter of clothes,
dead batteries and water aged in the canteen.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to know what you need in case of emergency, there's
a good guide in the front of the phone book. However, the phone
book fails to mention one necessity: cash.
</P>
<P>
   As many of us learned during the big blackout last week, ATMs
are controlled by the forces of darkness at PG&AMP;E. I learned the
need to keep a stash of cash in the days following the '89
earthquake. Believe me, bartenders don't give out free beer, even
if it is warm.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, someone keeps stealing my stash of cash. I'm not
very good at hiding it from myself.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing the phone book doesn't mention: Whiskey isn't a
bad thing to keep on hand, in quantities large enough to settle
your nerves, but small enough to keep you from looting.
</P>
<P>
   When we think about being prepared for the worst here, we tend
to think about material things. The San Francisco Bay area is a
material place. But there's more the true survivalist can do than
build stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Fire Department offers a course called
Neighborhood Emergency Response Training, or NERT.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't invent the name,'' said Lucien Canton, director of
the Mayor's Office of Emergency Preparedness. ``The program began
when citizens who fought the Marina fire came to us and said they
wanted some training.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the program more than 8,000 people have been trained in
the basic medical, firefighting and rescue skills they'll need
before the professionals arrive. That could be a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Canton says not everyone has to take the training. ``One trained
volunteer can help manage five or six people who aren't trained,''
he said. ``It's what the military calls a force multiplier.''
</P>
<P>
   Or what people in the Bay area call cooperation, similar to the
cooperation they displayed in last week's blackout.
</P>
<P>
   Get the water, food and batteries. But I don't think you need a
motorcycle to flee town.
</P>

   MIDEAST-CLINTON _ GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip _ In his most dramatic
speech on foreign policy, President Clinton Monday told the
Palestinian people they are free to ``etermine their own destiny on
their own land.'' He then witnessed a Palestine National Council
vote annulling parts of the Palestinian charter that deny Israel's
right to exist. That action quickly met with the approval of
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. It was the first visit
to Palestinian-controlled territory by an American president, and
Clinton applauded PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat for making bold moves
toward peace with Israel and said it was time to think harder about
ways to cement the peace and ensure a more prosperous future for
all Palestinians. Developing. (Deans, Cox News Service 800).

   GAZA-SCENE _ In one of the many refugee camps here, a Hamas
family watches Monday's historic events; American President Bill
Clinton on the television, a picture of the radical Palestinian
group Hamas' chief bomb-maker on the wall. They are a clear example
of the new Palestinian view of Clinton and the United States, as
U.S. flags were draped all over, offices were closed and thousands
of people holding American flags for the first time without burning
them crowded the streets. Will also include general reaction from
Palestinian leaders to Clinton visit. Developing. (Kaplow, Cox News

   IMPEACH-CLINTON _ JERUSALEM _ President Clinton again signaled
his willingness to accept censure Monday, saying, ``I don't believe
it's in the interest of the United States and the American people
to go through the impeachment process and have a trial in the
Senate.'' (Deans, Cox News Service 300).

<P>
   IMPEACH-ADVICE _ WASHINGTON _ What could President Clinton do
between now and Thursday to sway the impeachment debate in his
favor. Political consultants offer their advice. (Shepard, Cox News
Service).IMPEACH-LOBBY _ WASHINGTON _ Impeachment is said to be a
vote of conscience, but that hasn't halted efforts to pressure the
undecided House members. A pro-Clinton rally organized by Jesse
Jackson is planned for Thursday. Each side is accusing the other of
hardball tactics. (Malone, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-LOGIC _ WASHINGTON _ Logic suggests that if House
members believe President Clinton committed impeachable offenses,
they should vote to impeach him. But several undecided Republicans
say otherwise. They say that if Clinton confesses to conduct they
consider impeachable, they will vote against impeachment, but if he
continues to insist he is not guilty, they will vote for
impeachment. Seeking members, spokesmen or experts to explain this
seeming paradox. (Dart, Cox News Service).

   CENTURY _ Gov. Lawton Chiles will return a final time to this
small town on the Florida-Alabama state line where, as an obscure
state legislator, he became ``Walkin' Lawton,'' taking the first
step on a statewide trek toward election to the U.S. Senate and
eventually the Governor's Mansion. A motorcade Tuesday will take
Chiles' body from Century to Tallahassee over familiar roads he
walked to win repeated elections and, frustrated and depressed, he
made his decision to withdraw _ only temporarily as it turned out _
from politics after 18 years in the Senate. (Crowley, Palm Beach

   The New York Times News Service plans the following  &UR; Science
Times &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, Dec. 15:
</P>
<P>
   SCI-EVOLVE (Undated) _ The study of evolutionary convergence has
taken on a new twist, as researchers look beyond such flamboyant
cases of anatomical similarities to detect subtle instances of
convergence among molecules. They have found striking analogies
between the antifreeze proteins that allow two unrelated groups of
fish swimming on opposite ends of the globe to endure in icy
waters. They have detected a bizarre form of antibody protein in
species as different as camels and sharks _ antibodies that look
eerily like each other, and unlike the antibodies of most
vertebrate creatures, yet that evolved along entirely autonomous
pathways. By Natalie Angier. (2200 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-HEPATITIS (Undated) _ An estimated 4 million Americans carry
the hepatitis C virus and will face difficult questions about
whether to start an expensive treatment that carries severe side
effects and, in more than half of patients, is unable to eradicate
the virus. Their interests have collided with those of a
pharmaceutical company eager to recoup its research expenses and
profit from its innovations. Some say the drug company is
needlessly alarming the American people about the threat of the
disease. By Denise Grady. (2000 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MIRROR-TECH (Undated) _ Scientists at MIT recently announced
what may be the most significant advance in mirror technology since
Narcissus first became entranced by his image reflected on the
surface of a still pool of water. Their new invention, which they
are calling the perfect mirror because it combines the best
features of the two previously known types of mirrors, promises to
have significant applications in a vast variety of fields,
including higher bandwidth fiber optics, more efficient cellular
phones, energy conservation, medicine, spectroscopy and even,
perhaps, cake decoration. By Bruce Schechter. (1550 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BODY-CLOCKS (Undated) _ In one of the weirdest-sounding
experiments in recent times, scientists at Cornell University
reported last spring that they had been able to reset human
biological clocks by shining intense light on the backs of people's
knees. This was, however, only one in a burst of stunning
experiments, that are revealing new insights into the ways that
biological organisms keep and tell time. By Sandra Blakeslee. (1400
words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WIT (Undated) _ A doctor's view of sitting through the drama
``Wit,'' off-Broadway play about terminal cancer and chemotherapy,
where the patient is the hero. By Abigail Zuger, M.D. (990 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-AMELIA-EARHART (Undated) _ The latest trail of detective
work on Amelia Earhart has led to an official document in London
describing a lost collection of weather-beaten bone fragments. The
bones themselves have vanished, but measurements suggest the
subject was a woman, European and about 5'-6'' tall. This and some
other circumstantial evidence seemed interesting enough to
organizers of the American Anthropological Association that the
association acted as host for a recent news conference in
Philadelphia presented by the recovery group. Still, authorities
say, the mystery is far from being solved. By Malcolm Browne.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PATCH-ADAMS (Washington) _ The real Patch Adams reflects on
the movie ``Patch Adams'' that is about to make him famous. Like
the doctor in the movie, played by Robin Williams, the real-life,
53-year-old physician has spent his adult life thumbing his nose
(often Pinocchio-long or red and bulbous in clown's makeup) at the
medical establishment and at what he sees as its cancerous hunger
for profits. By David Stout. (1350 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Science questions answered: How can a snake
swallow prey that is bigger in diameter than it is, like a whole
rabbit? (290 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ Shorts on science: quasars, Mars poles and
volcanic gases. (680 words)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Fitness and Health &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Because of eased regulations from
the Food and Drug Administration, scores of drugs that were once
promoted only to doctors are now being promoted directly to
millions of consumers in magazines and newspapers and on television
and radio. This year the pharmaceutical industry is expected to
spend well over $1 billion to try to persuade you to ask your
doctor about one or another prescription drug. The tactic has its
benefits and risks, its champions and detractors. But before
consumers ask a doctor to prescribe a drug from an ad, they should
heed what the experts are saying about these ads and how wise
consumers should respond to them. By Jane E. Brody. (1250 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PASSIVE-SMOKE (Undated) _ Effects of passive cigarette smoke
were gauged among California bartenders before and after the
smoking ban went into effect. After the ban, even the bartenders
who smoked themselves showed some health improvements. By Erica
Goode. (700 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FITNESS-YOGA (Undated) _ Tackling power yoga, a highly
sweaty workout. The purpose of it is to build up body heat and, as
a result, sweat, which enhances flexibility and makes some of the
pretzel-like postures easier. By Gary Taubes. (1250 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MELANOMA (Undated) _ New digital-imaging techniques may soon
help doctors search for early signs of melanoma, the most deadly
form of skin cancer. By Anne Eisenberg. (580 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ Shorts on health and fitness:
</P>
<P>
   _ Gas powered vehicles driving around ice rinks can make for bad
air and even contribute to athletes' agony. (370 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Pro and Con: Should doctors accept gifts from patients? (430
words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Most women know that taking 400 micrograms of folic acid early
in pregnancy can reduce the risk of their babies having certain
birth defects of the brain and spine. But a new survey conducted by
the March of Dimes warns that most women take that B vitamin too
late in pregnancy to be effective. (240 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ When air passengers are hunkered down in their economy seats
the consequences can be far more serious than a crick in the neck,
stiff muscles, swollen ankles or an aching back. The shrinking
space between seats can trap the legs and restrict movement,
triggering blood clots. Experts offer tips on dealing with it. (320

TEAMS FEEL IT HURTS TO REVEAL A LOT ABOUT INJURIES 
</HEADLINE>

 By LARRY TYE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They tell us they do it because they want to keep the other team
guessing.
</P>
<P>
   They say it's to protect their players' privacy.
</P>
<P>
   They swear it's a matter of money _ as in not shifting the odds
for bettors, be they in Las Vegas or the office gambling pool.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, the result is that professional sports
teams regularly mislead the press and public, or at least they
don't own up to the full truth about how hurt their stars are and
how they're being treated. That's what the Patriots did last week
when they kept mum about the pin doctors inserted in Drew Bledsoe's
finger Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The long tradition of deception has gotten to the point where
Americans know more about the polyps scraped out of President
Reagan's colon _ and the way their fathers and brothers are popping
Viagra and Propecia _ than we did about how Bledsoe's doubly
fractured finger was being readied for a game against the St. Louis
Rams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody was betting on how many polyps Ronald Reagan had,''
explains Bob Cousy, the driving force of the Celtics from 1950-63
who is now the team's television analyst. ``In the case of
professional athletes, and especially a key performer such as
Bledsoe, everyone concerned has to take great precautions. They
don't want to exaggerate an injury to alarm the betting public, or
to underplay it, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``The easiest way to deal with it is to give the minimum amount
of information.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is precisely what the Patriots have done with Bledsoe, and
did earlier this season with star receiver Terry Glenn. It's what
the Celtics did for years with Larry Bird and his finicky back,
what the Red Sox did with Roger Clemens's inflamed throwing arm,
and what Bill Parcells did during his Patriots coaching tenure
whenever it suited him. And it's how other pro franchises across
the country typically handle things whenever a critical player
sustains a critical injury.
</P>
<P>
   They say as little as possible. They insist that team doctors do
the same. And they hedge right up until game time or, in Bird's and
Bledsoe's cases, even after the game is under way and they're
playing but it's unclear whether they will return after a break.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it has been done for decades, or at least for the
36 years that Gene Monahan has been around minor and major league
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say it hasn't really changed much,'' says Monahan,
head trainer for the World Series champion New York Yankees. ``In
fact, for the most part, it has been less secretive recently. Head
coaches now are more open and frank with the press.''
</P>
<P>
   Players also have less incentive than before to hide their
injuries, says Dick Johnson, curator of the Sports Museum of New
England: ``Before this age of agents and guaranteed contracts,
players were scared to death that if they told owners they were
hurt, they'd lose their jobs. Willie O'Ree, the first black player
in the National Hockey League, who played for the Bruins, hid the
fact that he'd lost 90 percent of his vision in one eye because of
an injury in junior hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were only 100 players in the NHL then, and he knew if he
told anybody, he'd never receive the opportunity to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty years later, with Bledsoe, it's the team that seems to be
doing the hiding. The Patriots did confirm Friday that their ace
quarterback had a pin inserted in his finger to provide the
stability that a cast and splint had offered in recent weeks, but
they released that information only after it was reported in
Friday's Globe. And they declined to provide further details about
the operation or what it could mean for Bledsoe, offering up only
the National Football League-required information that he's
``probable'' to play and has a finger injury.
</P>
<P>
   Why do teams provide so little?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's strictly strategic,'' says Patrick Sullivan, whose family
used to own the Patriots and who was the team's general manager
from 1983-90. ``If you're St. Louis and you're trying to get ready
for a game, there's a big difference between preparing for a game
with Drew Bledsoe compared to Scott Zolak.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Lowery, spokesman for the Patriots' current owners, agreed:
``Obviously, the less information we share about a particular
injury, the better position it puts us in competitively.''
</P>
<P>
   Gambling is another consideration, much as it has been since
Cousy started playing nearly half a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed Macauley and I would come back to our hotel from Mass on
Sunday morning and some guys with pushed-in noses would be sitting
in lobby chairs watching us,'' Cousy recalls. ``We'd deliberately
limp or put our arms in slings and watch them scatter to the
phones, imagining them calling their bookies telling them we were
injured.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor keeping teams and team doctors from telling all
is recognition of a player's right to the same privacy enjoyed by
other patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unethical to talk about your case to a third person
without your permission,'' says Arnold Scheller, the Celtics'
doctor. ``The athlete is always a patient first.''
</P>
<P>
   True, but others insist that star athletes give up their privacy
rights because they are stars, much the way President Reagan and
other public figures do. That's what most reporters presume and
why, if the team and its doctors won't talk, the press ferrets out
responses from doctors not involved in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``That (ticks) me off,'' says Scheller, who acknowledges that he
occasionally does the same thing when asked about athletes he
hasn't treated. ``What you do is get doctors who enjoy the ego
(gratification) of being asked a question and they'll start running
at the mouth without really knowing the details. That's not
constructive for anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Another downside of professional teams keeping secret their
players' injuries is the example it sets for younger athletes.
``Even at the high school level, teams try to hide the fact that
certain players have an injury,'' says Dr. Lyle Micheli, director
of sports medicine at Children's Hospital in Boston and a
consultant to the NFL Players Association. ``This has all taken on
a new dimension.''
</P>
<P>
   Another argument against teams keeping quiet about injuries is
that it's getting tougher and tougher to keep such secrets,
especially from opponents who have increasingly sophisticated
scouting operations. Bledsoe's surgery eventually leaked out to the
press, and Micheli says it was known even earlier through the
medical grapevine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opposition sure as heck knows he's got a bad finger,''
agrees Milt Schmidt, who learned what it was like playing injured
during his 20 years as a Boston Bruin, during which he was named
the NHL's most valuable player and leading scorer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much difference if the public or opposition
knows,'' adds Hall of Famer Schmidt, now 80. ``And if he has a bad
finger, the team has something to lean on if it loses.''

AIRLINES WOO BUSINESS TRAVELERS WITH ON-THE-GROUND HOSPITALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID ARMSTRONG  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Full-body massages. Manicures. Haircuts. Free
drinks. Internet access. Fax machines and copiers, of course. How
about a putting green?
</P>
<P>
   These are some of the lures that airlines use to attract
high-paying business-class passengers in VIP lounges at major
airports around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Business travelers are what airlines call ``high-yield''
passengers. They pay much higher fares than coach travelers,
providing carriers with a big chunk of their revenue.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Chicago-based Cambridge Group travel research
firm, business travelers accounted for just 9 percent of passengers
but 45 percent of revenue in 1997. The airlines compete both in the
air and on the ground to woo these lucrative customers.
</P>
<P>
   Syndicated travel writer Ed Perkins noted that round-trip
business-class fares from the West Coast to London ``are averaging
about $6,000. First-class can reach $8,000-$9,000. By comparison,
you can usually get something in coach for $700 or $800 this time
of year.''
</P>
<P>
   Business-class fares have jumped about 40 percent since 1996,
according to American Express Travel.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins said business travelers are the beneficiaries of
``almost everything the airlines are doing in terms of
innovation.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes VIP lounges. And with most major airlines involved
in global alliances with other airlines, passengers may now access
worldwide networks of lounges regardless of the airline they are
using.
</P>
<P>
   In the air, business-class passengers have more legroom, wider
seats and better food than coach passengers, not to mention free
drinks, individual video screens at their seats and other perks.
</P>
<P>
   But the pampering starts even before take-off.
</P>
<P>
   ``The experience you have at the airport is part of your
experience of an airline,'' said Karen Goodwin, editor of Frequent
Flyer magazine, a Chicago-based national monthly.
</P>
<P>
   At the 5-month-old Chek Lap Kok airport in Hong Kong, the Cathay
Pacific Airways VIP lounge has a cool, minimalist style. It's built
on a mezzanine to enhance openness, airiness and views, and it lets
the soaring rooftop of the main passenger terminal double as the
lounge ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want chintz and velvet, don't go there,'' said Cathay
chief executive David Turnbull.
</P>
<P>
   At the San Francisco International Airport, United Airlines
operates three business-class Red Carpet Clubs _ two in the
domestic terminal and another in the international terminal. United
estimates half its 30,000 daily passengers at the airport frequent
a lounge.
</P>
<P>
   First-class and business-class passengers, frequent fliers and
others who pay a yearly fee of up to $400 can avoid jammed, noisy
departure gates by slipping into the Red Carpet lounges. There,
they find Internet access, small meeting rooms (bookable in
advance), finger foods, cappuccino, newspapers and magazines, and
occasional wine tastings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of our corporate focus is on the business traveler, and
some of our biggest customers are in Silicon Valley,'' said Laurie
Giammona, United's manager of customer service at the San Francisco
airport. Giammona said United maintained separate business centers
outside the lounges for corporate road warriors who fly a minimum
100,000 miles a year on the airline.
</P>
<P>
   VIP lounges at some major airports are even snazzier. At
London's Heathrow, Chicago's O'Hare, Miami International and Los
Angeles International, Chicago-based UAL offers new Arrivals by
United lounges that have showers, concierge service, marble walls
and granite countertops and shelves, toiletries by Molton Brown of
London, and baggage check-through to the traveler's destination.
</P>
<P>
   While some travelers use the lounges to relax, others use them
to work.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Alfred, a Houston-based executive for the Oracle Corp.,
spent part of Thursday morning working on his laptop computer in
the Continental Airlines business lounge at the San Francisco
airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I manage global accounts,'' Alfred said. ``Members of my team
are scattered all over the world. I had a meeting in San Ramon with
a colleague who left for London. She's in Dubai now. I use the
lounges quite a bit _ anywhere I can plug in and sit down.''
</P>
<P>
   The mother of all airport lounges may be Virgin Atlantic
Airways' Virgin Clubhouse at Heathrow. It has a putting green, a
beauty salon, video game room, library, music room and showers. In
addition, Virgin offers passengers in Upper Class _ the airline's
moniker for merged business and first class _ complimentary
transport to and from the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be driven in a chauffeured car, a Range Rover or on a
motorcycle, or take a `limoboat,''' said Elvi Taveras, a Virgin
spokesman in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Virgin, founded 14 years ago by the flamboyant British
entrepreneur Richard Branson, also offers in-flight massages, up to
100 movies and a stand-up bar at 35,000 feet. According to Taveras,
Virgin introduced individual video screens in business class in
1989, installing them in economy class in 1991 _ the first in the
world to do so.
</P>
<P>
   All this came about, Taveras said, because ``Richard Branson was
tired of these long-haul flights, and being bored to death.''

   POLLOCK-NAMUTH (New York) _ The figure of Jackson Pollock _
action painter, dancing dripper, sullen rebel _ was made by Hans
Namuth's camera. Namuth's camera helped make Pollock famous and
Namuth's camera was blamed for Pollock's demise. Now, on the
occasion of Pollock's retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art,
Namuth's camera is there again. Namuth himself died eight years
ago. But his photographs and films are being used to strip away the
layers of paint and lore that have covered Pollock since the 1950s.
Of course, the stripping is tricky, because Pollock's tortured
relationship with Namuth is itself part of the myth. A critic's
notebook by Sarah Boxer.

   TURKEY-PROTEST (Istanbul) _ Arts Abroad: Turkey's most prominent
young novelist, Orhan Pamuk, has turned down the coveted title of
``state artist'' awarded to him this month. Of the 85 writers,

honor several declined, saying they disapproved of the selection
process or did not want to be associated with some others on the
list. But Pamuk was the only one who said he was doing so for
political reasons. By Stephen Kinzer.

   SCI-EVOLVE (Undated) _ The study of evolutionary convergence has
taken on a new twist, as researchers look beyond such flamboyant
cases of anatomical similarities to detect subtle instances of
convergence among molecules. They have found striking analogies
between the antifreeze proteins that allow two unrelated groups of
fish swimming on opposite ends of the globe to endure in icy
waters. They have detected a bizarre form of antibody protein in
species as different as camels and sharks _ antibodies that look
eerily like each other, and unlike the antibodies of most
vertebrate creatures, yet that evolved along entirely autonomous
pathways. By Natalie Angier. (2200 words)

<P>
   SCI-HEPATITIS (Undated) _ An estimated 4 million Americans carry
the hepatitis C virus and will face difficult questions about
whether to start an expensive treatment that carries severe side
effects and, in more than half of patients, is unable to eradicate
the virus. Their interests have collided with those of a
pharmaceutical company eager to recoup its research expenses and
profit from its innovations. Some say the drug company is
needlessly alarming the American people about the threat of the
disease. By Denise Grady. (2000 words)

   SCI-MIRROR-TECH (Undated) _ Scientists at MIT recently announced
what may be the most significant advance in mirror technology since
Narcissus first became entranced by his image reflected on the
surface of a still pool of water. Their new invention, which they
are calling the perfect mirror because it combines the best
features of the two previously known types of mirrors, promises to
have significant applications in a vast variety of fields,
including higher bandwidth fiber optics, more efficient cellular
phones, energy conservation, medicine, spectroscopy and even,
perhaps, cake decoration. By Bruce Schechter. (1550 words)

   SCI-AMELIA-EARHART (Undated) _ The latest trail of detective
work on Amelia Earhart has led to an official document in London
describing a lost collection of weather-beaten bone fragments. The
bones themselves have vanished, but measurements suggest the
subject was a woman, European and about 5'-6'' tall. This and some
other circumstantial evidence seemed interesting enough to
organizers of the American Anthropological Association that the
association acted as host for a recent news conference in
Philadelphia presented by the recovery group. Still, authorities
say, the mystery is far from being solved. By Malcolm Browne.

   SCI-PATCH-ADAMS (Washington) _ The real Patch Adams reflects on

the Food and Drug Administration, scores of drugs that were once
promoted only to doctors are now being promoted directly to
millions of consumers in magazines and newspapers and on television
and radio. This year the pharmaceutical industry is expected to
spend well over $1 billion to try to persuade you to ask your
doctor about one or another prescription drug. The tactic has its
benefits and risks, its champions and detractors. But before
consumers ask a doctor to prescribe a drug from an ad, they should
heed what the experts are saying about these ads and how wise
consumers should respond to them. By Jane E. Brody. (1250 words)

BIRDCAGES CAN DRESS UP A HOUSE WITHOUT FEATHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Birdcages can be works of art in themselves.
</P>
<P>
   If you are not enthusiastic about cleaning up after plumed
critters or can't stand their chirping, singing or talking,
consider the birdcage as simply a decorative room accessory.
</P>
<P>
   Victorians were very fond of such cages, whether displayed
empty, filled with a plant or housing an intriguing songbird. Gilt
cages could be found in Europe as early as 1700.
</P>
<P>
   With a little imagination or sense of humor, a cage can make a
dramatic statement as a display case, especially if it's entwined
with rustic grape vines, leaf or flowering plants and contains a
fake bird. Unusual props can create a conversation piece, such as a
fake stuffed or ceramic teddy bear, bunny, fish or cat.
</P>
<P>
   It's also fun to decorate a birdcage so that it's in style with
each season and/or holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Birdcages come in various sizes and shapes in metal and wood.
Most are made from wood with delicate metal rods, hooks and
latches.
</P>
<P>
   Many decorative wood cages are stained in a warm wood, painted
in a fashionable color or antiqued to look like aged brass, bronze
or copper. Early cages were often made from expensive woods, such
as mahogany, to match suites of furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Some even come unfinished, where the finished look is up to you.
</P>
<P>
   If you do plan to house a live bird in the cage, you might want
to select an unfinished cage or a metal one, so that there are no
dangerous finishes for tweetie to gnaw on.
</P>
<P>
   A decorative birdcage can be used in virtually every room in the
house, including an ornate one hanging in the foyer or a bamboo or
rattan one on the patio. Large birdcages can make great storage
places for towels in the bath.
</P>
<P>
   A hot-air-balloon cage comes with a hook at the top. Once hung,
it looks like it's floating across the room. The basket under the
balloon is often used as a planter.
</P>
<P>
   Others that are shaped like churches, houses, palaces, temples
and pavilions often come with short legs or a flat bottom for a
table top or pedestal setting. Some styles can be wall-mounted.
</P>
<P>
   Antique Hardware and Home in Bluffton, S.C., 800-422-9982,
carries a vast selection of decorative birdcages that cost from
about $89 to $799.
</P>
<P>
   Vintage cages often can be found in antiques shops, at flea
markets or at yard and garage sales.

 &HT;    CLINTON ADDRESSES GAZANS AMID HISTORY OF TRAGEDY, TERRORISM AND
ANTI-AMERICANISM
 &HT;    With COX-MIDEAST-CLINTON-1215.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAZA CITY, The Gaza Strip _ On the wall is a photo of the most
notorious bomb-maker in Palestinian history. On the beat-up old
television is U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   And, seated Monday evening on the thin floor cushions and cheap
rugs of their crumbling block house, the Badrasawi family likes
what they see.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are happy that the president of the world is coming here to
see the tragedy we live in,'' says Ibrihim Badrasawi, a 37-year-old
tile worker who earns about $15 a day to support a wife and six
children.
</P>
<P>
   His family is like thousands of others sandwiched between a
violent past and a glimmer of hope brought by the first visit of an
American president to the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   America was long seen as an imperialist force here, backing only
the Israeli occupiers at the expense of the 1 million Gazans.
</P>
<P>
   But, Monday was a day of jarring sights and sounds signaling a
change in the way Americans and Palestinians view each other.
</P>
<P>
   There were barefoot children carrying plastic American and
Palestinian flags. There were former guerrilla fighters, having
traded in fatigues for double-breasted suits, fixated on a hotel
television that broadcast Clinton's helicopter arrival.
</P>
<P>
   And the Badrasawi house, nearly unfurnished and with his
children in front of the TV, was a mind-boggling mix of desperation
and wishful thinking.
</P>
<P>
   They live off one of the sandy, labyrinthine alleys in the
50-year-old Beach Refugee Camp. Just off the Mediterranean Sea, it
is packed with 50,000 Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrihim Badrasawi's brother was shot to death by Israeli troops
in 1990. It was during the height of the Intifada uprising that
turned the narrow streets of these refugees camps into flashpoints
where Palestinian kids and Israeli soldiers clashed and died almost
daily.
</P>
<P>
   Another brother was arrested six weeks ago by Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat's police, accused of being active in the terrorist
group Hamas that America and Israel urge Arafat to smash.
</P>
<P>
   In a gold frame on the wall is Hamas bomb-maker Yehye Ayash,
whose bombs killed dozens of Israelis until 1995, when he was blown
up by a booby-trapped cellular phone in what was widely believed a
mission of Israeli agents.
</P>
<P>
   But, the Badrasawis say they are tired of violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to see a Jew killed or an Arab killed,'' says
Mudalaleh Badrasawi, Ibrihim's 60-year-old mother. ``I sacrificed
my son. What are we going to get? We want a Palestinian state, of
course.''
</P>
<P>
   The family fled what is now Israel in 1948 and is among the more
than 700,000 Gaza refugees. The peace process has left Gaza under
Palestinian control and there have been physical improvements. Raw
sewage does not flow down their alleys as much.
</P>
<P>
   But Gazans make an average of 20 percent less money now than
five years ago and Ibrihim Badrasawi can no longer go to work in
Israel, where he made about five times as much money.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes Clinton can change that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago there was hatred toward the Americans,'' he
says. ``Now we are all carrying the American flag because the
American president is here.''
</P>
<P>
   On his 8-year-old television, he watches leaders in the
Palestinian National Council stand and affirm that they no longer
want to destroy Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have now proved that we do not want to push Israel into the
sea. They have no more excuses,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he endorses peace or Hamas is unclear. Many Palestinian
families are split among the political and non-political, fighters
and breadwinners.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, he says the bomb-maker's picture was left behind by the
brother who is now in prison. A few of the brother's children are
around too, now his responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   During the long, televised Palestinian leadership meeting,
Badrasawi has changed from his dusty work clothes and washed away
the dirt that caked his eyebrows and hair.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Clinton speaks, Badrasawi is clean-scrubbed and
sitting on the floor next to his mother. He looks like a new man
hoping for a new era.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit means that there will be a Palestinian state, he
predicts, and that all the tragedy will have been worth something.
His face lights up as ``president of the world'' talks about the
``dispossession'' of Badrasawi's people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never expected an American president to talk about our
suffering. This is really big for us,'' he says. ``Of course,
nobody will ever forget this. Not even the children.''
</P>

`BABE' SEQUEL FALLS VICTIMS TO TODAY'S MORALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WALTER ADDIEGO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The recent resignation of Universal Pictures
production chief Casey Silver was the least surprising news out of
Movieland in a while. There's no mystery: Few of the studio's
recent major releases _ dating back to ``Primary Colors'' _ came
anywhere close to what the industry calls success.
</P>
<P>
   The last straw was the new ``Babe,'' a big-budget sequel to the
surprise 1995 hit about a sweet-tempered, talking pig. Universal
considered the follow-up a can't-miss deal. But when the crucial
numbers from the long Thanksgiving weekend came in, the $90 million
sequel had made less than $8.5 million, which, by the arithmetic of
audience falloff, means it had rolled over and died. Following
``Meet Joe Black,'' another high-profile disappointment, it was
curtains for Silver.
</P>
<P>
   What happened to ``Babe: Pig in the City'' (and Casey Silver)
goes beyond the reporting on how much money is involved in
family-oriented, G-rated movies. (And it's a considerable sum _ ``A
Bug's Life,'' ``The Rugrats Movie'' and ``Babe'' placed in the top
five over this do-or-die weekend.) The important story is the
radical shift in the content and mood of these pictures, and the
erosion of the boundary between entertainment for children and
adults.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing troubles may have hurt the new ``Babe,'' but so did
the picture's surprisingly dark mood. The charm of the original
film was in the little pig's naivete in the face of life's troubles
and his determination to overcome his limits. In the new movie,
Babe has the same positive qualities, but he's almost peripheral to
the picture's black comic sensibility. As the title indicates, he
leaves the farm for the big city, but it's an urban nightmare, a
police state where animals get the short end of everything.
</P>
<P>
   Who is the audience for this movie? The director, George Miller,
created the ``Mad Max'' movies, over-the-top satires about humanity
struggling in a world of depleted resources _ hardly films for kids
(at least by the old standards). In spirit, the G-rated ``Babe''
sequel echoes the outrageous, barbaric world of Mad Max, with its
comic-book violence, savage characters and mordant view of human
nature. Picture good old Babe wearing a dog collar with nasty metal
studs, as he does in the film; Miller doesn't believe the old
categories are worth respecting any longer.
</P>
<P>
   A powerful undercurrent of irony and doubt dominates this new
style of cross-generational entertainment. Take ``The Rugrats
Movie,'' which debuted at No. 2. Maybe it doesn't push the edges
quite as hard as the ``Babe'' sequel, but it still offers, by
conventional standards, a pretty curdled viewpoint. The ``Rugrats''
TV show on Nickelodeon, and other recent animated TV offerings,
look different, and provide a comically critical look at American
domestic life.
</P>
<P>
   A recent New Yorker piece by Mimi Swartz discusses the
``Rugrats'' phenomenon: ``The babies had an addled, homely look
that made them hipper than their smooth, glossy counterparts on
other kids' shows. ... The show projected a jaded view of family
life and consumer culture.''
</P>
<P>
   This barbed outlook has been pushed even further in other cable
shows (e.g. ``The Angry Beavers''), and the ratings prove it has a
considerable audience. The genius of cable programmers, and in
particular Geraldine Laybourne, former Nickelodeon president, was
to see that they could use these shows to make inroads on
mainstream TV _ which is now playing catch-up.
</P>
<P>
   While the edgier sensibility in family entertainment is gaining
influence, declaring victory would be premature. At the box office,
the more conventional ``A Bug's Life'' is the major success (it
opened in first place, and remains there; ``Rugrats'' is fourth,
while ``Babe'' has dropped to No.7). Tradition-minded parents have
little use for the more pointed stuff and have objected loudly to
the ``Babe'' sequel.
</P>
<P>
   Network TV, and the Disney Co. have gravitated toward programs
for kids that won't draw fire from conservative critics. The
result: shows and movies that were dull and dishonest in turning a
blind eye to noncomforting realities.
</P>
<P>
   This safety-first mentality begins in the idea of childhood as a
separate, special stage of existence, a golden age that responsible
adults are bound to try to protect. The notion peaked in the 19th
century, though of course there were subversive voices to be heard,
even in the heart of the Victorian era _ Lewis Carroll comes to
mind. But in the main, respectable parents wanted their children to
digest respectable lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are a lot of children (and adults) uninterested in this
sort of lesson, but now it's no secret that a steady diet of
moralistic entertainment is just too much medicine. Storytellers
have always known that fairy and folk tales with frightening,
violent, mature or non-optimistic content aren't simply something
that children can be exposed to, but stories they must hear _ for
the sake of their mental health, or spiritual development, however
you choose to view it.
</P>
<P>
   So the cat is out of the bag, or, more aptly, the pig is out of
the poke. Many Americans have accepted a more challenging sort of
entertainment that is less age-specific. That conservatives are
waging a cultural war against this new material is a testament to
its success. Parents trying to hold the line are having a tough
time because the stuff is everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, the ``Babe'' sequel and ``The Rugrats Movie''
define how far the change has progressed. With its modestly
subversive content, ``Rugrats'' is a hit, while the more
challenging ``Babe'' tried to go too far, too fast.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to the unfortunate Casey Silver, who
gambled that a mass ``family'' audience was willing to be led
somewhere it hadn't gone before. The box office suggests that
viewers found the new territory too scary. Silver was trying to
stay ahead of the curve, and instead spun off the road and crashed.

INTRODUCING KIDS TO COMPUTERS
</HEADLINE>
  By LIZ RUSCH 
 c.1998 Child 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Because computers play a greater role in parents' lives at home
and at work, kids can't help being curious about these exciting and
powerful machines. But how should we introduce our children to
computers? And when?
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Saltzman of Seattle let his 5-month-old son bang on the
keys of his home computer, but Barklay wasn't truly interested in
the computer until he was about 18 months old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then he was ready to sit on my lap and watch me scroll through
text,'' says Saltzman. ``At 30 months, Barklay would click the
mouse if I held it steady. By the time he was 3, he could control
the mouse by himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Barklay's early experience with the computer is typical of many
children's. By 30 to 36 months, your child may develop the fine
motor skills that are needed to manipulate a mouse or to peck at
the keyboard. Around this age, he may also show a desire to play
with the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Should you let him? Go ahead. Gone are the days when early
childhood experts wondered if we should shield young children from
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are no longer asking if its developmentally appropriate to
use computers,'' comments Douglas Clements, professor of learning
and instruction at the State University of New York at Buffalo.
``Preschoolers have shown enjoyment and confidence using them.
Rather than being frustrating, computers are a source of pride.
Rather than isolating children, computers can be a catalyst for
social interaction with parents and with other children.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say you should plop your little one in front of a
monitor as soon as she can hold up her head. ``I don't think that
children under the age of 2 need to touch the computer other than
to explore its physical nature,'' says June Wright, professor of
early childhood education at Eastern Connecticut State University
and director of the Computer Discovery Project, a research program
that looks at the role computers play in children's learning.
</P>
<P>
   But even banging on the keyboard or seeing you at the computer
can teach a lesson. ``If you hold a baby on your lap as you work on
the computer, she'll see that something happens when you push a key
and that it happens on the screen,'' says Barbara Bowman, president
of the Erikson Institute, a graduate school in child development in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   There's no reason to pressure a young child into using a
computer. But when she's ready, here are some suggestions on how to
get her started:
</P>
<P>
   _ Help her master the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   During your child's first encounter with the computer, don't be
surprised if she tries to use the mouse like a TV remote control,
says Wright. But, she adds, ``many young children figure out how to
use the mouse without much guidance.''
</P>
<P>
   If your child needs some help, avoid programs that require her
to click and drag. Pointing and clicking are enough of a challenge.
Sit down with her and demonstrate using the mouse. Then, lay your
hand on top of hers, positioning her index finger over the mouse
button. Help her move the cursor to a large target and click on it,
Clements recommends.
</P>
<P>
   If your child still has trouble, let her point at the screen to
indicate what she wants to select, and you can click on it for her.
Or move the cursor into position, hold the mouse steady, and let
your child do the clicking.
</P>
<P>
   Some kids find typing easier because the keyboard is stationary.
To acquaint your child with the keyboard, set the font size to 24
or larger and let her press the keys to make letters, Wright
suggests. Some software for young children uses only a few keys,
such as the enter key or the space bar. Tape construction paper
onto these keys so that she can find them easily.
</P>
<P>
   _Choose an appropriate program.
</P>
<P>
   Test it first at a library or computer store (the Web sites of
many software companies also have demos that you can try). Look for
programs with attractive animation and characters who have engaging
voices. Software that uses classic songs, such as ``The Wheels on
the Bus,'' and favorite games like peekaboo also help children feel
at home.
</P>
<P>
   Toddlers are especially delighted with software that lets them
click and explore. For example, a program may let a child click on
the door of a house and go inside, then click on a cuckoo clock to
hear its sound. Try to avoid software in which an action occurs _
such as a dog wagging its tail _ without the child making it
happen. These programs make it more difficult for children to
understand cause and effect thereby encouraging passivity.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't make the computer a baby sitter.
</P>
<P>
   Once your child is up and running, he'll want to play with the
computer by himself. This often happens between ages 3 and 4,
depending on the child. ``By then, children will explore a program
to its fullest'' says Wright. But computers shouldn't become
electronic baby sitters. Break up time on the computer with other
activities, such as reading, drawing and playing outdoors with
friends, says Bowman.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that most young children seem to limit
themselves, Wright has observed. ``Three-year-olds seldom stay on
the computer for more than 15 or 20 minutes at a time,'' she says.
``A 4- to 6-year-old may get more involved, for up to 30 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Restrict your child if he spends over an hour in front of e
screen every day, says Clements. The American Academy of Pediatrics
suggests that children over age 2 shouldn't be allowed to watch TV
for more than one to two hours daily, and many experts believe you
should include the time your child spends on the computer in this
limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computers ask kids to make decisions, which encourages a more
involved and active stance than the passive way they take in TV,''
notes Clements. But, he says, watching a good TV program is better
than playing with a lousy computer program.

<P>
   Rebel against the expense and extravagance of the holidays by
making wreaths that cost you next to nothing and help tidy up your
landscape. Use greenery clipped from around the yard for a small
wreath to snuggle around the bottom of a candle or a larger wreath
for the front door. Here's how.
</P>
<P>
   1. Use hand-held pruning shears to prune off 4- to 6-inch long,
supple, young stems on evergreen trees and bushes. Target lanky
shrubs in need of a trim to give hedges and shrubs a final shaping.
</P>
<P>
   Yews, which grow in foundation plantings around many houses,
have fine needles that compress nicely into a velvety, dark green
wreath. More aromatic pines and hemlocks also are suitable if you
can find unwanted sprigs or branches to remove. Select carefully as
these branches will not resprout.
</P>
<P>
   Use sprigs of other evergreens with varying colors and textures
to decorate the surface of the wreath. The glossy blue-green
foliage of hollies, golden- or blue-hued junipers and false
cypress, and fan-shaped sprays of arborvitaes make handsome
contrasts. Other choices include the petite rounded leaves of
boxwood and toothed, dark green leaves of teucrium.
</P>
<P>
   You also will need some showy red berries, nature's ornaments
conveniently provided in holiday colors. Cotoneasters, winterberry
holly, viburnums, multiflora and shrub roses, and crabapples all
produce beautiful berries you can use.
</P>
<P>
   For variety, consider tracking down clippings of gray,
stem-hugging northern bayberries with a quiet appearance made up
for by the delightful bayberry aroma.
</P>
<P>
   If you look even harder _ in a perennial garden, meadow, or
shrub border _ you can find plants such as old-fashioned
hydrangeas, ornamental grasses and milkweeds that have interesting
pods and seed heads to add to the mix.
</P>
<P>
   Use them naturally clad in earthy shades of gray, tan, and brown
or spray paint them bright colors such as red, gold, and silver.
</P>
<P>
   2. Other supplies you will need are fine green florists wire and
a wreath shaper.
</P>
<P>
   To make a wreath shaper, use a clean piece of wood for the
wreath frame base. Secure two concentric circles of 3- to 4-inch
high pegs or small-headed nails onto the wood. Put the pegs or
nails 1 to 2 inches apart. For a large wreath, make the diameter of
the outer circle 12 inches and the inner circle 6 inches; a small
wreath will be 6 inches and 2 inches.
</P>
<P>
   For a distinct holiday touch, purchase red velvet bows, golden
ornaments, or other festive nicknacks you insert into or tie onto
the finished wreath.
</P>
<P>
   3. Assemble the wreath by filling the wreath frame with an
evergreen base of yews, pines, or other fine-leaved sprigs. Firm
the sprigs down, molding the young stems around the curve of the
frame pegs. Don't worry if some small shoots slip out of
confinement; they will give the wreath a soft, natural appearance.
</P>
<P>
   If you intend to top the wreath with a heavy layer of dried
flowers and decorations, a simple foundation of yew sprigs will
likely be all that's necessary.
</P>
<P>
   If you want a texture-rich blend of greenery to top with
berries, add other evergreens _ junipers, blue spruce, and the like
_ when the space between the concentric pegs is almost full. Lay
these sprigs on the base as desired, but don't be surprised if they
shift a bit when you secure the wreath with wire.
</P>
<P>
   To hold the wreath together, wrap it with florists wire. Begin
by circling the wreath once with wire and twisting the loose end to
the rest of the wire to secure it. Continue to loop the wire around
the wreath, slipping it under and around about an inch from the
previous loop until you have encircled the entire wreath. When
finished, cut the wire and secure the loose end to a nearby wire.
</P>
<P>
   4. Spray the evergreen wreath with Wilt-Pruf to keep it fresh
longer. Dilute 1 part Wilt-Pruf emulsion in 10 parts water and
spray it outdoors when the temperature is over 40 degrees. Let the
wreath dry in daylight before bringing it in.
</P>
<P>
   5. Add decorative materials. If you are using dried flowers or
pods and seed clusters, cut large sprays down to small sprigs,
about 3 to 4 inches long so they stay in scale with the wreath.
Slip the stem base under the wire and into the wreath to hold it in
place.
</P>
<P>
   To maintain a feeling of balance, repeat similar looking
materials like the feathery heads of foxtail grass or dried sprays
of statice around the wreath. Angle them so the tips flail toward
the outside of the wreath, giving it a graceful look.
</P>
<P>
   Or, use just one kind of material, like red-dyed sea-oats
available at craft stores, to ribbon the center of a wreath,
leaving green highlights on either side. Maintaining a symmetrical
appearance gives a pleasing uniformity to smaller wreaths used
around candle bases.
</P>
<P>
   A larger door wreath is a good candidate for asymmetrical
decorating. You can tie a bright bow or put a golden gilded leaf
and cone at the base of a door wreath. Then arrange sprays of dried
flowers to emerge from either side of it. The top of the wreath can
be a quieter blend of varying greenery or berries.
</P>
<P>
   5. Arrange small wreaths around the base of thick scented
candles or holiday candle sticks to dress them up for special
occasions. Secure larger wreaths to the front door.
</P>
<P>
   If you intend to give wreaths as a gift, store them outdoors in
a cool, dry location until the last minute. They keep better that
way.

NATURAL REMEDIES FOR A COLD WAR
</HEADLINE>
  By CHARLES DICKSON 
 c.1998 magazine 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It always seems to happen at the most inopportune times. You
have a sales meeting, or a speech or a date and pow _ you get hit
with a cold. Now you look like Rudolph and bark like Rover and feel
like something the cat dragged in.
</P>
<P>
   Any drugstore has an aisle of products for cold symptoms. Many
are combination cold remedies formulated to wipe out several
symptoms with one capsule. They typically contain one or more of
the following: an antihistamine (to dry up your runny nose), a
decongestant (to open up your stuffy nose), an antitussive (to
quell your cough) and a pain reliever (to ease your aches).
</P>
<P>
   If you want to use the combination products, you do so with the
government's blessing as long as your symptoms match up
specifically with those on the label. The problem is that shotgun
remedies may give you too much or too little of a certain drug or
you could be getting a drug ingredient that is just plain useless
for your symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Let's look at some natural alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   The widespread use of vitamin C was stimulated by the writings
of Linus Pauling, winner of Nobel prizes in chemistry (1954) and
peace (1962), who promoted vitamin C as a preventive for colds.
Those who take it for this purpose generally ingest 300 to 500
milligrams a day.
</P>
<P>
   For those who already have a cold, studies have shown that
taking up to 1,000 milligrams per day can reduce both its severity
and its duration. Most physicians warn that such a high dosage
should not be taken daily over a long period of time since such
amounts tend to interfere with copper absorption in the body and
can also cause diarrhea and cramping.
</P>
<P>
   What about chicken soup? Benefits of this folk remedy have been
confirmed by a study at Mt. Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach
which found that hot chicken soup got nasal mucous flowing
significantly better than a cup of hot water. At the University of
Nebraska in Omaha, researchers found that in a test tube chicken
soup slowed the movement of neutrophils _ immune cells activated by
cold viruses. ``When you have a cold, neutrophils normally migrate
from the blood to mucous membranes stimulating such symptoms as
inflammation and mucous secretion and perhaps fever and cough,''
says Stephen Rennard, chief of pulmonary and critical care medicine
at the university's medical center.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's spice up that chicken noodle Soup with three
additional cold fighters: garlic, onions and hot pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Garlic has been found to contain compounds with chemical actions
similar to those of antibiotics. While it's considered to work best
against fungal infections, garlic has antibacterial and antiviral
effects as well. You're aware of how the juice of freshly sliced
onions can make your nose run and your eyes water. Onion has been
used by homeopathic physicians to treat colds and allergies with
these same particular symptoms. Onions contain many of the same
compounds found in garlic and may also stimulate the immune system.
And hot pepper is effective since it contains capsaicin, which
causes you to perspire and make your nose and eyes run, thus
enabling you to cough up mucous or clear your nose when you blow.
</P>
<P>
   A variety of teas have been shown to be effective in winning the
cold war. There is mullein, a yellow flowering member of the
snapdragon family. Place two teaspoons of dried leaves in a cup of
hot water and let it steep for 10 minutes, then drink it. Mullein
is available at health food stores as well as being a common
roadside weed in most of temperate North America. It is very
effective in relieving congestion.
</P>
<P>
   Pungent ginger, is also effective. Place a teaspoon in a cup of
boiling water. The oil found in ginger is similar to that found in
red pepper. It has an irritating effect on the nose and throat that
helps to thin mucous, making it easier to cough up when you are
congested.
</P>
<P>
   The pretty purple flower known as echinacea has an impressive
reputation as a natural antibiotic. Make a tea by using capsules of
the root powder (available in health food stores or your herb
garden). This herb has a long history of use among Native American
tribes and scientists have found that a compound in echinacea helps
kill a broad range of disease-causing viruses and bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if you don't mind the bitterness, you might find relief
in goldenseal, a member of the buttercup family. To make a tea use
one teaspoon of powdered root in a cup of hot water. Steep for 10
minutes and add honey, sugar or lemon to mask its bitter taste.

ANOTHER MONUMENT TO ELVIS
</HEADLINE>
  By JAY ATKINSON

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLY SPRINGS, Miss. _ You have been to Graceland, paid the $10
to tour Elvis Presley's Memphis home and final resting place.
</P>
<P>
   You've passed the glass peacocks outside the Music Parlor, seen
the 17 television sets, the tacky shag carpet in the Jungle Room,
the gold records in the Trophy Room, the graves in the Meditation
Garden.
</P>
<P>
   You may think you've seen it all but you haven't. Not by a
Mississippi mile.
</P>
<P>
   Here in this town off Highway 78 in northwestern Mississippi,
about midway between Memphis and Presley's birthplace of Tupelo,
Miss., is a bizarre attraction called Graceland Too.
</P>
<P>
   It has been the home for 44 years of Paul B. MacLeod, who lives
here now with his 25-year-old son, Elvis Aaron Presley MacLeod. The
elder MacLeod's wife of 22 years left him, he says, after she told
him to choose between her and his museum.
</P>
<P>
   It is a rickety two-story house packed literally to the ceiling
with Elvis photos, records, costume replicas and other Presley
memorabilia. It is open every day of the year, 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   The entrance fee of $5 includes the commentary of MacLeod
himself. Standing in the unheated entranceway, his hair slicked
back and wearing a sheepskin coat and muttonchop sideburns, the
middle-aged MacLeod says, ``We got more facts on Elvis than the
Library of Congress. If alien life were to visit, stopping here
would do more to explain American culture than any other place on
earth.''
</P>
<P>
   In the continuous, punctuation-free monologue of a carnival
barker, MacLeod regales his visitors with facts, half-truths and
hearsay about the complicated doings of the King, who died in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Holding an automobile antenna, MacLeod points to a portrait of
Presley and says, ``The only scar on Elvis was this little one
above his eye because he liked to do his own fight scenes in movies
and he got that in 'Wild in the Country.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I hope I die in 10,000 years but when I do I'll be buried
in this-here copy of a gold suit made for the movie 'Kid Galahad'
and my epitaph will be 'Here Lies the World's Greatest Elvis
Fan'...''
</P>
<P>
   In the collection is every TV Guide reference to Presley since
1956 and several photographs of Paul MacLeod posing with his son.
In one, a teen-age Elvis MacLeod strums a guitar while his
jumpsuited dad looks on with pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the people down there in Tupelo worried,'' says Paul
MacLeod referring to the Presley birthplace about 70 miles
southeast. Asked if his collection is insured, MacLeod says, ``If
they can get by me and my son, who's 6-5, they can have it.''
</P>
<P>
   Recalling his first glimpse of Elvis on television almost 40
years ago, MacLeod says he decided ``that a guy who sang like that
and dressed like that and combed his hair like that, he was more
than just a flash in the pan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Were you a personal friend of Elvis?'' asks one towheaded
young visitor.
</P>
<P>
   MacLeod's blue eyes dart around the room. ``I got close to him a
few times,'' he says.

 &HT;    Nevertheless, the 31-year-old Roberts is picking up that fat
paycheck for the film she's currently shooting _ reuniting with her
``Pretty Woman'' co-star Richard Gere and director Garry Marshall
in ``Runaway Bride.''
 &HT;    She's earning considerably less for playing the title role
opposite Susan Sarandon and Ed Harris in ``Stepmom'' (opening Dec.
25), although she and Sarandon could clean up nicely if the film
turns out to be a box office smash because they were producers on
the film.
 &HT;    In ``Stepmom,'' Sarandon plays Jackie, whose ex-husband (Harris)
has married Isabel, a vain, ambitious fashion photographer played
by Roberts. Not surprisingly neither Sarandon nor her two young
children are wild about their father's new spouse.
 &HT;    Things change, however, when Jackie learns she is dying. At
first Isabel is less than thrilled when she realizes she's
inheriting a family. She has to learn to change her priorities and
win the love and trust of the ailing Sarandon and her young
children if she is to grow into the stepmom role.
 &HT;    Roberts, looking relaxed with her hair down to her shoulders and
dressed in sweater and slacks, was in obvious good humor she showed
up at New York's Waldorf-Astoria to talk her role, which she calls
the most mature of her career.
 &HT;    Roberts, without children of her own, still found herself in
sympathy with Isabel since the character's life was much like that
of a career-driven actress.
 &HT;    ``Isabel says she never wanted to be a mom and yet finds herself
struggling to cope with being a surrogate parent--an unwanted
stepparent,'' says Roberts. ``Given her age she's more interested
in her career than stuck with a family. I can relate to that. And
it's a no-win situation because Jackie is the perfect mother and
Isabel can only come off a poor second when she tries to become a
parent.''
 &HT;    Should Roberts herself decide to become a parent, she says she
is certainly not about to become a stay-at-home.
 &HT;    ``I don't understand this one-versus-the-other business,
especially in this generation. Would any of us be here as capable
human beings if our parents didn't work? My mother always worked. I
know people talk as if this work I do would make it more difficult.
I have no children so maybe I'm talking out of the side of my head,
but it seems to me that you work for four months and then you don't
work for like nine months. That's a lot of kid time.''
 &HT;    And she's the first to admit that the kind of money her
star-wattage commands would pay for a lot of mother's helpers. Now
that she's become Hollywood's highest paid female star, however,
the actress insists getting paid big bucks is the last thing she
thinks about.
 &HT;    ``I love what I do and I'd do it for free,'' she says. ``I'm not
going to perform better if I get paid more or less. It's not pound
for pound--where you only pay for the legs or the smile or the big
hair. That's not how it works. When you're up at 4 a.m. and out in
a bikini and it's 30 degrees outside--it doesn't matter how much
they're paying you. At that moment you still think it's not
enough.''
 &HT;    Roberts says she's no longer the callow, vulnerable 20-something
star whose personal life has been chronicled to the point of
exhaustion since she first burst on the scene in ``Mystic Pizza''
(1988), ``Steel Magnolias'' (1989) and then as a star in ``Pretty
Woman'' (1990).
 &HT;    ```Stepmom' is first real-life grown-up part that deals with
real complex issues and problems I've ever done. It's about kids,
husband, job, not about makeup and wardrobe. I couldn't have done
it five years ago--it wouldn't have had the same value to me.''
 &HT;    Besides teaming up with Gere again she has just finished
``Notting Hill,'' shot in London, in which she gets to romance Hugh
Grant for writer Richard Curtis who wrote ``Four Weddings and a
Funeral.''
 &HT;    And her career is riding high again after a series of flop
movies like Woody Allen's ``Everyone Says I Love You'' (1996),
Robert Altman's ``Ready to Wear'' (1994), the horror film ``Mary
Reilly'' (1996) and ``The Conspiracy Theory'' (1997) opposite Mel
Gibson.
 &HT;    Her private life reads like a five-reeler: In l991 she broke off
her engagement with Kiefer Sutherland three days before the
wedding. In l993 she married singer Lyle Lovett but they divorced
21 months later. In between were relationships with Dylan McDermot,
Liam Neeson, Jason Patric and New York gym-owner Pat Manocchia.
 &HT;    She insists her relationship with TV actor Benjamin Bratt (``Law
and Order'') is still on despite published reports to the contrary.
But she says, ``I'm not getting married any time soon.''
 &HT;    Bratt has lasted more than a year on her arm but she still lives
alone in a New York apartment not far from her sister Lisa who is
two years older. (Roberts also has an older brother, actor Eric
Roberts.)
 &HT;    In the long-awaited reunion with Gere she plays a woman who goes
from man to man. Is the role based on her own penchant for skipping
from boyfriend to boyfriend?
 &HT;    She good naturedly handles the question: ``Of course not, '' she
says. ``The movie is fiction.''
 &HT;    But there's no doubt she's delighted to be back with her
``Pretty Woman'' star, and she adores the film's director,
Marshall.
 &HT;    ``The whole film has been a gas,'' she says. ``Garry is
fantastic and gets me to go out on a limb and do things I wouldn't
do for other directors. I know I can trust him. On `Pretty Woman'
he had me do something I was scared about. I thought I'd humiliate
myself forever but when I saw the scene in the finished movie with
an audience, people were peeing laughing.''
 &HT;    Since shooting ``Stepmom'' she has become bosom buddies with
co-star Sarandon, who has a family with actor-director Tim Robbins:
``Susan and Tim are my absolute idols,'' says Roberts. ``Some day I
would like to have the kind of career that Susan has and the kind
of relationship with a man that she has with Tim.''

UNDATED: in a decade. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``An artist who is able to anticipate the feelings of women is
clearly going to be very powerful,'' said the RIAA's Ganoe. ``The
recordings released this fall have drawn women into the stores at a
time when there's similar product out there.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those women is Fort Worth's Tracy Morse, a developmental
editor with the Dryden Press who has bought CDs by Amos, Crow,
Emmylou Harris, Jewel and Shawn Colvin.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more women artists now,'' she said. ``It's been the
trend, and it's encouraged women to buy more music. And not to say
anything bad about male artists, but the women are really into
their music and put a lot of effort into their lyrics. And you hear
their music everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The fragmenting of rock radio also deserves credit for the rise
of female artists. Rock used to be classic and alternative: Now
there's mainstream, adult album alternative, light-alternative, and
on and on. Many female artists (especially Crow and Morissette)
sound right at home in several of these formats. At the same time,
mainstream country has embraced the strong story lines and
independent sentiments at the heart of Carter and the Dixie Chicks,
among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``So there's a lot more women with a certain sound able to find
a home than when there was just rock and classic rock,'' said Morty
Wiggins, senior vice president for marketing at A&AMP;M Records. ``It's
created an opening for these artists to show their potential. One
thing these women have in common is great songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``More people appreciate female rock singer/songwriters now.
It's an interesting phenomenon. Before, if you were a female and
you didn't have a mainstream pop hit, you were toast.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which might make it even harder for male
singer/songwriters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to think of CDs by solo male artists that have
done really well,'' said Ganoe. ``You're hard-pressed to think of
one. Right now they're certainly not dominating the landscape.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is saying there's been a definite turn away from signing
solo male singer/songwriters, and some point to the attention paid
to Shawn Mullins.
</P>
<P>
   But neither Mullins' major-label debut nor the debuts of highly
touted male singer/songwriters Jude or Eagle-Eye Cherry have broken
into the national Top 40.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really not a format that supports solo male artists,''
said Karen Glauber, senior vice president of Hits magazine.
``Unless you're in a band, you're not rock enough for rock radio.
If Dave Matthews was making records in the stripped-down way Jewel
is, he wouldn't be on the radio.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, the latest CDs by Lenny Kravitz and Chris Isaak, who were
both white-hot just a few years ago, have performed poorly:
Kravitz's ``5'' peaked at No. 36, and Isaak's more recent ``Speak
of the Devil'' never broke the Top 40 and has fallen to the bottom
fourth of the Billboard Top 200 CD chart after two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of great male singer/songwriters, but that's not
manifested by the charts,'' said A&AMP;M's Ralbovsky. ``Male
singer/songwriters will put together bands so they're not perceived
as a singer/songwriter _ they want a band identity. ``Look at Jakob
Dylan or Dave Matthews. They're the singer and principal songwriter
in those bands, but the perception is that a band identity is
better.''
</P>
<P>
   What ensures that women's popularity will continue _ and perhaps
become even more prevalent _ is that all of the above factors show
no sign of changing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are versatile enough to move across the gamut,'' said
Pleiades Productions' Brown. ``Celine Dion can sing the whole
gamut. I think this will continue as long as what they're singing
is what the public wants _ and most of 'em provide exactly what the
public wants.''

AT THE GRAMMYS, AT LILITH FAIR, IN SALES, WOMEN RULED MUSIC IN
1998
</HEADLINE>
 
(Accompanied by MUSICIANS-UP AND COMERS) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the '60s, James Brown said it's a man's, man's, man's world.
In 1998, James would be very, very, very wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Women rule pop music: They take home the Grammys (Record of the
Year, Song of the Year and New Artist all went to women in '98),
they've teamed up to make Sarah McLachlan's Lilith Fair tour the
summer's most popular package show for two years in a row, and from
Celine Dion to LeAnn Rimes to Natalie Merchant to Shania Twain to
Erykah Badu, they sell in the millions.
</P>
<P>
   Fall releases skewed heavily toward solo female acts such as
Sheryl Crow, Alanis Morissette, Lauryn Hill, Jewel and Whitney
Houston. This pounds home the point that record companies,
ever-mindful of just how important the late fall/Christmas season
is, have put their faith in the women. According to SoundScan,
Morissette's ``Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie'' has sold
914,000 copies in its first three weeks, or 460,000 more than U2's
best-of set. Jewel's ``Spirit'' has sold more than 300,000 CDs in
less than two weeks, and Houston's ``My Love Is Your Love'' has
sold 123,000 copies in less than two. At several points this fall,
five of the top 10 CDs on the national charts were by solo female
artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, if you look at this year and the releases by female
artists, you're coming awfully close to covering the top of the
charts,'' said John Ganoe of the Recording Industry Association of
America. ``Solo female artists in pop music are very, very strong
right now. Country music, for example, is now shaped to a
tremendous extent by female artists.''
</P>
<P>
   Even women who don't shift all that many units, such as Lucinda
Williams and Joni Mitchell, both with new CDs out in the past few
months, are hailed as critics' darlings for their songwriting,
their CDs touted as some of the year's best.
</P>
<P>
   And this doesn't even count big-time new acts like Dallas' own
Dixie Chicks, Australia's Natalie Imbruglia and Ireland's Sinead
Lohan.
</P>
<P>
   Janna Brown doesn't think of herself as part of a growing trend
or shift in the market when she buys a Celine Dion or Sweet Honey
CD. The Fort Worth photographer just appreciates that in female
artists she can hear music that echoes what's going on in her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women get more airplay, so they're known more,'' said Brown,
46, vice president of Pleiades Productions, an organization that
has produced concerts featuring female artists for years. ``Part of
it is they're strong women _ they come across as independent. When
I think of Celine Dion, she seems like a planted, strong-willed
woman. And Melissa Etheridge and Sheryl Crow are very strong.
They're very independent and confident in themselves. (And) anybody
can apply the music to themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   That last comment, industry experts say, pinpoints the current
popularity of women's music. Truth is, there are numerous factors
at work. For example, the music often has a maturity not found in
pop music. A solid country, hip-hop or pop-rock song with
intelligent lyrics (be it by Hill or McLachlan or Nashville's Deana
Carter) _ one written from a personal perspective touching on
universal themes _ hits home to a lot of music fans looking for
something to identify with, according to Steve Ralbovsky, senior
artist and repertoire executive with Interscope Records.
</P>
<P>
   ``What works best right now is female singer/songwriters,'' said
Ralbovsky, who signed Nanci Griffith to Elektra several years back
and Lohan to Interscope last year. ``There's obviously a resonance
in people's lives _ rock is most compelling when it's inseparable
from a socio-political climate, and we're living in a time when
there's no socio-political agenda influencing rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot more personal-relationship dialogue in the
music,'' said Ralbovsky. ``It's more a time of internal reflection,
and people like Sarah and Jewel and Tori write about relationships
and internal thoughts. People are looking for more depth _ there's
a search for something beyond the quick hit, a depth beyond the
fleetingness of so many bands that come and go. And there's a
richer resonance of the human experience in these women's
writing.''
</P>
<P>
   Simple economics is also pushing the growth of solo female
artists: Because more women have their own businesses and have
better jobs than ever before, they have more discretionary income.
According to Business Women's Network president Edie Fraser, women
now account for 50 percent of all leisure travel spending, make 51
percent of all auto purchases, and make nearly 50 percent of all
computer purchases. Naturally, this has affected the recording
industry. According to the RIAA, last year was the first in which
women purchased more music than men, 51.4 percent to 48.6 percent,
a shift of 8 percent in a decade.

SOME OF THE FEMALE ARTISTS EXPECTED TO BREAK OUT IN 1999

<TEXT>
<P>
   So which female artists are coming up behind Celine, Sarah and
Lauryn in 1999? Our picks:
</P>
<P>
   BEWITCHED: This teen all-gal quartet plays the same sort of
teeny-bop pop as the Spice Girls and All Saints, but these Dublin
girls are touting a wholesome image: They wear jeans, not Ally
McBeal-short skirts. Europe's all over them: Bewitched's first two
singles _ ``C'est La Vie'' and ``Roller Coaster'' _ both entered
the chart at No. 1. ``Bewitched'' gets a U.S. release Feb. 2.
</P>
<P>
   LILA McCANN: At the ripe age of 17, McCann has had several
country hits and has seen her debut, ``Lila,'' go gold. She also
toured stadiums last spring with George Strait. The Seattle high
schooler has cut a Bryan White/Steve Wariner song, ``You're Gone,''
for her sophomore effort. The as-yet-untitled CD is due out in
March; good timing, especially because fellow teen LeAnn Rimes
plans to cut back on live work next year while trying to break into
films.
</P>
<P>
   NICOLE RENEE: Prince, or whatever we're supposed to call him
now, is a good reference point for this 23-year-old Philadelphia
singer. Her recent self-titled debut, which will receive a major
push in '99 from its label, Atlantic, combines spirituality with
sexuality, and the music is as indescribable as anything Prince has
done, crisscrossing every genre from R&AMP;B to rock. A tour is slated
to begin in mid-'99.
</P>
<P>
   KELLY WILLIS: How long must this woman wait to be a big deal
outside Texas? Not long, judging by the advance copy of ``What I
Deserve,'' her forthcoming CD on Rykodisc, and her first since
1993. Due out Feb. 23, ``Deserve'' should bring her the acclaim
she's due. Willis wrote three songs with Jayhawks leader Gary
Louris; her husband of two years, Bruce Robison, chips in on one;
and she also does commendable covers of Nick Drake's gorgeous
``Time Has Told Me'' and Paul Westerberg's ``They're Blind.''
Expect ``Deserve'' to be on more than a few best-of-the-year lists
this time next year.
</P>
<P>
   SEAN YSEULT: When White Zombie sundered this fall, lead vocalist
Rob Zombie got all the ink, releasing a CD and heading off on tour.
Meanwhile, bassist Yseult formed a trio called Famous Monsters and
released ``In the Night,'' a fun, scuzzy blast of metal, surf and
punk.

YOUNG IRISH PLAYWRIGHT STAGES BLARNEY-FILLED SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by LONDON STAGE) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In the vibrant days of Sean O'Casey and John Millington
Synge in the 1930s and '40s, Irish drama was the bravest expression
in world theater, and the most buoyant. There was a marked decline,
then a resuscitation by the '60s, when the gaudy wave that gave us
Brendan Behan also delivered the enduring Brian Friel.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is a new star in the firmament of Irish theater. He is
Conor McPherson _ can't get more Irish than that _ and he is only
28, but ``The Weir'' is his third play to be staged in both Ireland
and England. And ``The Weir'' is on its way to being the most
talked-about event of the current London theater experience.
</P>
<P>
   Under the title ``La Fille de Dublin'' (The Woman of Dublin),
McPherson's drama also has conquered Paris. A New York date is in
the offing, and the prediction here is that ``The Weir'' will make
it a grand slam, especially if its felicities are exhibited in one
of the more intimate Broadway playhouses.
</P>
<P>
   The drama actually arrived in London 17 months ago, but in a
tiny habitat _ upstairs at the Royal Court. Having thrived since
1888, the Royal Court at Sloane Square qualifies as England's
longest-established theater with the dedicated aim of producing new
plays. But the venerable building is undergoing some much-needed
repair; so ``The Weir''_ despite having captivated critics from the
word ``go'' _ could not be moved into the Royal Court's ample
auditorium, necessitating some other West End location.
</P>
<P>
   It's rather confusing. Here's ``a Royal Court Theatre
production'' housed since October in the Duke of York's Theater on
St. Martin's Lane; and every evening, some playgoers go to the
wrong house. Once they find ``The Weir,'' though, they're in for a
riveting experience.
</P>
<P>
   Conor McPherson's two previous plays, ``This Lime Tree Bower''
and ``St. Nicholas,'' struck Londoners as charming freaks that
somewhat stretched the definition of ``play.'' They were hardly
more than distended monologues, and McPherson certainly has a knack
for winding up a character and really letting him go with the old
blarney.
</P>
<P>
   That proves to be an aspect of ``The Weir,'' too, but here the
long, rambling, hilarious, ridiculous, character-enriching speeches
punctuate a stunning theatrical conceit. There's no tragedy quite
like tragedy unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   It's a 90-minute play of continuous action, and there's no
intermission. That's good, because the drama, after a sluggish
beginning, keeps mounting like perking coffee until it almost boils
over.
</P>
<P>
   The single, simple set is a tiny bar in an unnamed small Irish
village. The bartender is joined by his first customer, they carry
on, and for a time we think we're witnessing a revival of ``Juno
and the Paycock'' or ``The Playboy of the Western World.'' But no.
The bantering duologue between young barkeep Brendan and seedy,
50-ish Jack carries meaningful exposition. They talk about the
mysterious young woman from Dublin who is moving into their
sequestered lair for reasons they know not.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the woman, Valerie, is among them, accompanied by Finbar,
her realtor. Then raffish Jim comes in for a snort, and the full
company is complete _ a cast of five well-drawn characters nicely
limned by their players.
</P>
<P>
   Irish men are legendary liars; and Jack, Jim and Finbar by turns
concoct wild and ironic tall tales, each determined to outdo the
others in impressing the beguiling Valerie. She listens patiently,
then it's her turn ... and she shames the men with a gripping
personal account as genuine as theirs are phony.
</P>
<P>
   The quintet of Irish actors is barely known in England and known
not at all to Americans. Jim Norton as crusty Jack is a standout
among the men, but Dermot Crowley (Finbar) and Kieran Ahern (Jim)
shine in their appointed moments; and Brendan Coyle (Brendan), the
only player without a long, personally illuminating discourse, is
an appealingly youthful contrast. As for Michelle Fairley
(Valerie), she holds her audience spellbound.
</P>
<P>
   A weir is a barrier for withstanding water or wind or whatever.
There's an oblique reference to a weir in the early banter, but
that may be taken metaphorically: Valerie is the weir of truth,
exposing and repelling the fraudulence around her.
</P>
<P>
   You'll be hearing more about ``The Weir''; and Conor McPherson
bears watching now, and surely for a long while.

   Conor McPherson's ``The Weir'' is not the only live theater game
in London town. A perusal of the current stage scene there reveals,
of course, that Andrew Lloyd Webber is well-represented: Sir Andy's
cash kitty, ``Cats,'' is purring at the New London on Drury Lane;
``Starlight Express'' is roller-skating at the Apollo Victoria;
``The Phantom of the Opera'' haunts Her Majestys.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of playwright Alan Ayckbourn should note that ``Things We
Do for Love'' is in residence at the Duchess _ where
``Copenhagen,'' by Michael Frayn (''Noises Off''), is scheduled to
open Feb. 9.
</P>
<P>
   At present, Frayn's ``Alarms &AMP; Excursions'' is ensconced at the
Gielgud.
</P>
<P>
   Among the American imports are ``Into the Woods'' at the Donmar
Warehouse, ``Rent'' at the Shaftesbury and ``Grease'' at the
Cambridge, where the kids of Rydell High are ``booking to the
Millennium,'' according to a recent Times of London ad.
</P>
<P>
   A revival of the venerable ``Oklahoma!'' is due to arrive Jan.
21 for a limited run at the Lyceum. And if you can't score a ticket
to Casa Manana's Fort Worth production of ``The Complete History of
America (abridged),'' they'll be happy to accommodate you at the
Criterion.

IT'S TIME FOR FCC TO EASE UP ON `MICRO' BROADCASTERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) By JOHN AUSTIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lots of us love microbrewing. Ditto microwaving. There's another
micro out you might like, too _ if only the federal government
would allow us a taste.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking micro broadcasters. They air low-watt signals,
typically broadcasting programs on topics of interest to small
segments of the community from undisclosed locations _ say, a van.
They usually have a range of a few square miles.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, running your own little station without federal
approval violates the law, as a Connecticut micro broadcaster
recently learned when the FCC busted his gospel-music micro
operation. Though there was a time when smaller operators could
legitimately crank up as few as 10 watts, that was legislated out
of existence decades ago. Though the low-watters are commonly
termed broadcast ``pirates,'' one prominent micro broadcaster calls
the phenomenon ``electronic civil disobedience.''
</P>
<P>
   The feds, however, may finally be ready to concede that although
bigger is sometimes better, downsizing can be cool, too. At least
in small doses.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC appears to be poised to let the little kids back into
what has become a very high-stakes game. Hearings set for Thursday
in Washington, D.C., should determine whether regulations will be
loosened.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chairman is very interested in trying to make that
happen,'' said Andy Schwartzman, president of the Media Access
Project, referring to the head of the FCC. The Media Access Project
is a public interest law firm based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty of room on the air. Here's hoping the regulators
let the micro broadcasters give us a breath of something fresh.

TECHNOLOGICAL SCHOOL NAMES NRC HEAD PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW BROWNSTEIN  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TROY, N.Y. _ Shirley Ann Jackson, whose life story traverses the
mysteries of quantum physics and the realities of the nation's
racial divide, has been named the 18th president of Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, the current head of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
holds the sort of national stature trustees hope will put
Rensselaer Polytechnic on the map of elite technological schools,
along with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our old established image is the male-dominated, technological
nerd-based school,'' said Edwin Rogers, a computer science
professor who sat on the presidential search committee. ``This
sends a message, and hopefully the world will listen.''
</P>
<P>
   When she takes office in July, Jackson, 52, will become the
first black woman to head a major U.S. research university.
</P>
<P>
   And if the standing-room only crowds and four ovations at a
ceremony Friday were any indication, she has star power.
</P>
<P>
   With a few brief strokes, Jackson quickly established a rapport
with the university community, jokingly calling herself ``the
Energizer Bunny'' and graciously inviting Acting President
Cornelius Barton to the podium for a round of applause. She won
another ovation simply for being a mom _ delaying her move to Troy
until her son finishes high school in June.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson replaces R. Byron Pipes, who stepped down in April.
Pipes, though generally lauded as a fund-raiser, fell out of favor
for his inability to work with the faculty. By contrast, Jackson
spoke of ``a shared vision.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To be effective, a leader must be able to motivate those she
leads and to build consensus among diverse shareholders,'' she told
the audience.
</P>
<P>
   As head of the NRC, which has a $500 million budget and 3,000
employees, Jackson weighed the competing interests of
environmentalists and industry-heads in the politically charged
world of nuclear power.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after her appointment by President Clinton in 1995, Time
magazine ran a cover story on Connecticut's Millstone Power
Station, infamous for its repeated violations of safety standards
and reprisals against whistle blowers.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, even the NRC's harshest critics give Jackson high
marks for acknowledging the commission's mistakes and taking
responsibility for the actions of her predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a person of character,'' said James Riccio, staff
attorney at Public Citizen, a Washington-based advocacy group.
``Ms. Jackson came in as an academic. Her predecessor was smooth,
but she was much more solid.''
</P>
<P>
   The trustees selected Jackson Sunday from a field of three
finalists. They voted twice, the second time unanimously.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling her young experiments with live bees, Jackson repeated
the advice of her father: ``Reach for the stars and at least you'll
get off the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   At MIT, Jackson became the first black woman in the country to
earn a doctorate in physics, but was shot at, spat on, and told by
an MIT professor that ``colored girls should learn a trade.'' In
the 30 years that followed, Jackson served on the boards of MIT and
Rutgers University, taught physics at Rutgers and worked for 15
years as a research physicist at AT&AMP;T Bell Laboratories in Murray
Hill, New Jersey. Earlier this year, she was inducted into the
women's hall of fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I'm not unaware of the historic significance of the
things I've accomplished,'' she said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's salary was not disclosed, but it is undoubtedly more
than the $137,000 a year she made at the NRC. At the time Pipes
resigned, he earned an annual salary of $270,000.

10 GIFT IDEAS FOR THE GOLF ENTHUSIAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSAN FORNOFF  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Shopping for a gift for your favorite golfer?
There's something in every price range, and most gifts can be
ordered from catalogs and by the Internet, as well as from big
retailers and some area pro shops.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the top 10 for just about any year and just about any
handicap:
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 10, $10 to $50: A dozen golf balls, of either your
recipient's favorite make, or a cut above. Do your homework. Do not
take pot luck. There are too many choices on the market, and if you
offer rocks when your golfer wants marshmallows, you've bogeyed.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 9, $10 to $30: A golf glove or six. White is the safe
color if you're giving only one, and, remember, this is for the
player's non-dominant hand. If the golfer's a right-hander, the
glove is for the left hand. And if you're guessing at size, err on
the large side, not the small side.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 8, $40 to $140: An all-weather microfiber windshirt, in a
great color or pattern. These have replaced the golf sweater in our
climate because they are so lightweight and suitable for all-season
play.
</P>
<P>
   _ No.7, $40 to $400: A lightweight, good-looking and, most
important, waterproof rainsuit.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 6, $20 to $50: A waterproof hat that won't blow off.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 5, if your golfer loves Christmas: An golf-theme ornament
for the tree, to be had for $3 and up.
</P>
<P>
   _ No.4, starting at $20: Custom labels for the golfer's clubs.
At the lower prices, these are adhesive strips that wrap around the
shaft; at higher prices, one will find engraved metal inserts for
the grip end.
</P>
<P>
   _ No.3, $500 and up: A battery-powered golf cart that walks
along with the player. These are the absolute best gift for the
senior on your list who golfs as much for the walk as the game.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 2, at about $30 and up: A video/computer swing analysis,
lesson, series of lessons or, for the big spender, golf school.
</P>
<P>
   _ No.1: A golf outing _ either a gift certificate from a
particular course or your own promise of a round at the course of
the recipient's choice. If the gift is for a couple or a
significant other, a nice touch would be to include child care.
There's no better gift to the golfer than the game itself.
</P>
<P>
   Happy holidays.

STARS WHO DESERVE THE HALL OF FAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY RATTO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Baseball Hall of Fame ballots went out last
week with all the attendant drama of a sheep shearing on a sheep
farm during the 4-H Sheep Shearing Festival.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, we know that George Brett, Carlton Fisk, Nolan
Ryan and Robin Yount will be voted in, at least some and maybe all
four on the first ballot. The other 24 names, from George Bell to
Mike Witt, have little chance without the help of the Veterans
Committee, either because their accomplishments won't stand the
test of modern attention spans or because they've been on the
ballot so long they are starting to turn green.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, there will be no campaigns like the one the San
Francisco Giants assembled to try to usher Orlando Cepeda into the
Hall three years ago (although you may get some in the near future
on players like Dave Concepcion, Steve Garvey, Dale Murphy or Tony
Perez). There will be no great debates, no virulent arguments about
the merits of Mickey Lolich as opposed to Mike Boddicker. The news
will, in short, be about as riveting as the House Judiciary
Committee's impeachment vote.
</P>
<P>
   What of the game's contemporary stars?
</P>
<P>
   First, let's eliminate the 10 no-brainers, the sure or near-sure
first-balloters, the ones who dominated their positions for an
extended period of time and would get in if they never play another
inning. Those would be Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens, Dennis
Eckersley, Ken Griffey, Tony Gwynn, Rickey Henderson, Randy
Johnson, Greg Maddux, Mark McGwire and Cal Ripken.
</P>
<P>
   Next, let's eliminate the ones who have been very good for a
long time but not nonpareil at any particular point, or so dominant
that you can't imagine the Hall without them. That list would
include Mark Grace, Robby Alomar, John Franco, Bret Saberhagen,
Mike Mussina, Frank Thomas, Rafael Palmeiro and Craig Biggio.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves you with a debatable list of maybe 10 others, some
who ought to make it eventually, and others who will probably end
up enduring the same fate as Perez, who might be the most qualified
Hall of Famer not in the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, take John Smoltz and Tom Glavine, both of whom
thrived in Atlanta, and not just on Maddux's coattails. They are
very nearly as dominant, and Glavine was indeed better than Maddux
this year. And yet, one can make a case for them being sort of Don
Sutton-ish ... very good for a long time but never The Man. And
Sutton got in this past year mostly out of voter exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   Or Paul Molitor. Many folks will maintain he is a no-brainer
based on his amassed numbers, but he did miss a chunk of his career
with injuries and played in the long shadow of Yount for much of
his career. Molitor is a probable but not a sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   Or Barry Larkin, whose career has been obscured by (a) his
Midwestern reticence and (b) playing in Cincinnati for one World
Series winner and now a series of bad teams. He, like Molitor, has
had a good share of injuries, and when people called him the
National League's best shortstop, they never called him the best
shortstop in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Or Orel Hershiser, the best pitcher in the game in the late
'80s, living on guile and tooth enamel even at this late stage. Has
a World Series ring, played in Los Angeles, and can do the
schmooze.
</P>
<P>
   Or Jeff Bagwell, the inside-baseball crowd's favorite player but
not a national figure by any means. None of them would shame the
Hall by their inclusion, but it would not be seriously diminished
by their absence, either.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the guys who seem sure to make it but haven't
played enough to pass the ``could he get in today?'' test. Like
Mike Piazza, who is probably a sure thing but has two or three more
big-number years to accomplish. Or Mo Vaughn, who probably doesn't
get in now but could with two or three more monster years. Or Wade
Boggs, who spent a lot of years hitting .300 and well beyond but
was competing with Gwynn for the title and didn't last as long at
the top of his game. He wouldn't be a first-ballot inductee because
of that but probably would get in eventually.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, there is Albert Belle. His numbers are as good as
his image is bad, and by any mathematical stand he either is in or
will be as soon as he gets a good look at Camden Yards. Since there
is no deportment clause that gets you into the Hall (Ty Cobb got
in, after all), and the only real rule that could keep a player out
is betting on baseball (Pete Rose and Shoeless Joe Jackson haven't
gotten in, after all), there is no really good reason not to vote
Belle unless a voter flat doesn't like him. And there are plenty of
those.
</P>
<P>
   We'll be having this discussion again in a few years, with more
seeming sure things like Alex Rodriguez, Juan Gonzalez, Chipper
Jones, Sammy Sosa, Mariano Rivera, Nomar Garciaparra and Ivan
Rodriguez. We'll argue about David Cone and Jose Canseco and Trevor
Hoffman and Curt Schilling. And we'll all be in agreement on Jeff
Juden.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, it will eat up valuable time that has been spent
of late arguing about why Jose Offerman is worth six times as much
as Rich Aurilia, debating about rich clubs eating not-rich clubs as
though it were not a century-old phenomenon, or speculating where
the Expos, Pirates and A's are moving next week (hey, Albuquerque
is open, no credit checks, no waiting period). December is indeed a
very blessed time of year.

CHUMMY OLD MEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; It was a long shot. But after lifetimes of hard
work, the two senior citizens saw their chance to hit it big and,
despite the great risk involved, took it.
</P>
<P>
   That's the nutshell plot line for ``Waking Ned Devine,'' the
English-Irish lottery scam comedy that's become one of the season's
most popular specialty movies. But the same statements apply to the
film's two stars, 70-year-old Ian Bannen and 69-year-old David
Kelly, acting veterans who are finally experiencing a bit of
well-deserved stardom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you see, there's John Glenn taking off into space at the
same rate `Waking Ned Devine' is,'' cracks Kelly, the remarkably
bony, Irish-born member of the pair. ``Actually, we went into space
a long time ago and never came back. But hopefully, this will start
a trend for us old guys. I've got a few years left.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going well, and I like doing the autograph-signing
stuff,'' adds the fleshier, Scottish Bannen. ``But when, at our
age, women start writing love letters about how they'd like to
sleep with you, you do wonder if it's coming from an asylum.''
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily. Like ``The Full Monty'' before it, ``Ned
Devine'' makes a virtue out of a few unlikely nude scenes. That
business aside, though, the movie's real enchantment lies in its
portrayal of elderly schemers who think and act young, yet never
lose touch with the wisdom of their years.
</P>
<P>
   Set in an isolated Irish seaside village and filmed on the Isle
of Man between Britain and Ireland, the movie is the first feature
from writer-director Kirk Jones, an award-winning English
commercial-maker. Jones based both of the main characters _
Bannen's constantly calculating Jackie O'Shea and Kelly's more
timid but always game Michael O'Sullivan _ on aspects of his own
grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   And he insisted on going with Kelly and Bannen in the leads,
even though he could have gotten production money much more quickly
with younger actors _ or, as one producer suggested, by relocating
the thing to Canada with Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau as the
leads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very confident that actors with the stature of Ian
Bannen and David Kelly would bring a huge amount of charm and
character and presence to the screen,'' Jones says. ``That was very
much the direction I wanted to go in.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I suspected that they were both thinking that they'd had a
good run, made a living as working actors for 50 years and were
very grateful for that. But in their heads, they must have felt
that they had just been missing that one lead role in a feature
film that they had never really had. This script gave them a chance
to grasp that opportunity. If there is a special feeling to their
performances in this film, I think that what you sense is these
guys figuring this is pretty much their last chance for a role like
this _ and that they're really going to go for it.''
</P>
<P>
   You might recognize Bannen from one of the 70 or so movies
(including ``Braveheart,'' ``Gandhi'' and ``Hope and Glory'') he's
appeared in; he even earned an Oscar nomination for his supporting
role in the 1965 ``Flight of the Phoenix.'' Kelly, meanwhile,
boasts an extensive stage resume that includes his one-man
presentation of Samuel Beckett's ``Krapp's Last Tape.'' Kelly's
toured the world with that one, but everywhere he goes people
recognize him as O'Reilly, the aggressively inept carpenter he
played on John Cleese's classic comedy series ``Fawlty Towers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I recently got my 31st residual checks for that one,'' he
says. ``I'm very big in Malawi.''
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, Bannen and Kelly had not crossed professional paths
before ``Waking Ned Devine.'' But they both agree that their vast
experience is what makes the film's theme, as well as the central
friendship between Jackie and Michael, so affecting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Casting two younger guys would've ruined the film,'' Kelly
asserts. ``It then would've been about avarice and smart-aleck
crooks. Whereas these two guys, who grew old together but never
grew up, are rather endearing. It's essential that they're two old
guys _ and two old swingers. We didn't play them old; Kirk told us,
`Just be your own wicked selves.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are having a wonderful time with this, which is
something they never would have had when they were growing up,''
Bannen reckons. ``They came from farmers and fishermen, people who
worked around the clock and had very little time for fun. Dashing
about like madmen, trying to pull this thing off, is the most
exciting thing that's ever happened to them.''
</P>
<P>
   A little too exciting, as far as Kelly was concerned. Despite
his vast experience, he had never learned to either swim or drive.
``Ned Devine's'' skinny dipping scenes got no further than wading,
so they weren't a problem. But the nude motorcycle ride was a
different matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just knew I was going to die,'' Kelly recalls. ``I kept
thinking, `In a few minutes I'll be talking to Steve McQueen, and
I'll say ``You try doing `Bullitt' naked''.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The nude thing, of course, is the immediate worry when you
read the script. Then the day came, and I did have a little,
flesh-colored piece of elastic to wear. But after I'd already done
the thing _ terrified, sliding off the bike and everything else _
the cameraman said he could see the elastic, and did I mind taking
it off and doing it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't give a damn about the nudity at that stage. I was
just cold and terrified _ and wearing only a crash helmet that was
heavier than I am!''
</P>
<P>
   Bannen, who enjoyed the dignity of wearing underwear for his
motorbike ride, had other uncomfortable moments. The worst was a
scene in which Jackie carries a chicken dinner to the home of the
mysterious Ned Devine in the midst of a nighttime gale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bit hairy,'' Bannen understates. ``I was on the edge
of a cliff and they turned on this wind machine to go with the
rain. They hadn't tested it properly _ I believe it was an airplane
engine, actually _ and suddenly I was blown backward and nearly
over the cliff!''
</P>
<P>
   As Bannen and Kelly surely know by now, stardom does not come
easy. But if making a movie that tickles and touches people in
equal measure gets the job done, then their time may have arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between this film and those `Grumpy Old Men'
movies is that those fellows dislike each other and we, actually,
love each other,'' Kelly notes. ``There are some very moving scenes
in the film where that shows through. And people do go for it, the
tears are there _ but immediately after a belly laugh, and followed
by a belly laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people have said, `Saw the film, saw the film, I can't
wait to see it again','' Bannen says about ``Ned Devine.'' ``I
can't remember many people ever saying that to me before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, you mustn't get overexcited,'' he adds, sounding every
bit the long-haul trouper that he is.

MORAL HAZARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Dec. 20)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes a financial phrase kicks around the news, and we all
act as if we understand it.
</P>
<P>
   Did we bail out Mexico, and will we now rescue financially
distressed Brazil and Russia? Watch out for the  &UR; moral hazard &LR; .
Forming a consortium to prevent a collapse of a hedge fund that is
``too big to fail''? Careful _  &UR; moral hazard &LR; . As we tut-tut at
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan for
their not-to-be-worrying-about  &UR; moral hazard &LR; , the question nags:
What's the  &UR; hazard &LR;  and what makes it  &UR; moral &LR; ?
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal describes it as ``the distortions
introduced by the prospect of not having to pay for your sins.''
Bengt Holmstrom, a professor of economics at MIT, defines it as
``dysfunctional acts induced by a contract or law. If you have a
contract with me that says heads you win, tails I lose, this type
of a contract can induce you to take on inordinate amounts of
risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton G. Malkiel, professor of economics at Princeton, agrees
it involves ``cases where the existence of risk insurance alters
the behavior of the insured toward taking more risk.'' Because
depositors in savings-and-loans were insured by the government, the
owners were induced to roll the dice on investments in the 1980s;
heads the savings-and-loan lenders won, tails the government lost.
</P>
<P>
   The phrase, which you can now astound your friends by readily
defining, was born in the insurance industry early in this century.
It was extended by Kenneth J. Arrow, the Nobel laureate in
economics, in a 1962 scholarly journal and popularized in his 1971
book, ``Essays in the Theory of Risk-Bearing.'' Arrow was asked by
the Ford Foundation for a theorist's impression of the economics of
medical care. Here's the story straight from the Arrow, now at
Stanford:
</P>
<P>
   ``It struck me immediately,'' he tells me, ``that one problem
with insurance was that the user (the patient) was not required to
pay the full cost (indeed only a relatively small fraction of it).
Therefore, according to usual economic principles, the patient
would use medical care excessively.''
</P>
<P>
   Makes sense; whenever a disc in my back starts to crumble, I
greedily demand an MRI; if I weren't insured, I'd settle for a
cheaper X-ray. ``It came back to me,'' notes Arrow, ``that the
insurance industry had already recognized this problem and had used
the term  &UR; moral hazard &LR;  for it. The simplest example is burning
down one's house to collect insurance, an act that might clearly be
regarded as immoral _ less immoral if one had been slightly less
careful in putting candles out.''
</P>
<P>
   (Morally hazardous executive says: ``Business was terrible last
year, but we had this fire and I was insured, so I'm OK. You?'' His
friend: ``Same _ was losing a bundle but there was this flood and I
was covered.'' First crook: ``Good, but tell me _ how do you start
a flood?'')
</P>
<P>
   Arrow's extension of the old insurance industry term was taken
up quickly. ``Now it's applied in a wide variety of fields,'' he
reports, ``including in the last 15 years to the behavior of banks
when they have reason to believe that they will be bailed out if
they get into trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bail out &LR; , by the way, began as a verb meaning ``to clear water
from a boat by throwing it overboard'' and developed a new
overboard sense in 1930 as ``to parachute from an aircraft.'' Since
1951, as both noun and verb, it has referred to financial rescue of
an institution or nation, a practice that has led some critics to
think we have all gone overboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be Thou As Pure ...''
</P>
<P>
   When independent counsel Ken Starr went before the House
Judiciary Committee, he complained that ``a number of my
prosecutors are being  &UR; calumnied &LR;  and criticized.'' He repeated the
unfamiliar verb: ``To criticize and to  &UR; calumny &LR;  the men and women
with whom I'm privileged to serve ... is unfair, and I think it's
unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   The use of  &UR; calumny &LR;  as a verb is infrequent. Although the verb
form has a history in the language _ in 1895, The Pall Mall Gazette
wrote, ``The President has not been in office 12 hours ... and is
already  &UR; calumnied &LR; '' _ the preferred form is  &UR; calumniate &LR; . ``The
highest personages have been  &UR; calumniated &LR; ,'' wrote Miles Smith in
the Letter From the Translators to the Reader, the preface to the
1611 King James Version of the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   It is as a noun that  &UR; calumny &LR;  is best known. The word is rooted
in the Latin  &UR; calvi &LR; , ``to trick, deceive, intrigue against'' (also
the root of  &UR; challenge &LR; ), which progressed to  &UR; calumnia &LR; , ``false
accusation.'' The old Century Dictionary defined it well as
``untruth maliciously spoken, to the detraction of another; a
defamatory report; slander.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Calumniate &LR;  is to be preferred as the verb, because the
perpetrator can then be called a  &UR; calumniator &LR; , which has a zestier
flavor than  &UR; calumnizer &LR;  and avoids the  &UR; calumnist/columnist &LR; 
confusion. For an adjective,  &UR; calumnious &LR;  has the usage edge over
 &UR; calumniatory &LR; ; Shakespeare, in ``Hamlet,'' had Laertes observe,
``Virtue itself 'scapes not  &UR; calumnious &LR;  strokes.'' The Bard liked
the word; later in the play, after one of his bawdiest puns, Hamlet
says to the innocent Ophelia, ``Be thou as chaste as ice, as pure
as snow, thou shalt not escape  &UR; calumny &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   In mock modesty, an unidentified columnist is sometimes referred
to in this space as ``a vituperative right-wing  &UR; calumniator &LR; ,''
but it was not until Starr's use that the word was widely heard in
political discourse. Its origin in that sense was the ancient Latin
advice to solons,  &UR; Fortiter calumniari, aliquid adhaerebit &LR; ; its
English translation, ``Throw plenty of mud and some of it will be
sure to stick.''
</P>
<P>
   Kiss the Lawyers
</P>
<P>
   The same scandalmonger referred to in the above item recently
headed one of his harangues ``Kill All the Lawyers.'' This alluded
to Shakespeare's line in ``Henry VI, Part II,'' Act IV, Scene II:
``The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Robert Nylen of Ashfield, Mass., points out that the
speaker is Dick the Butcher, a know-nothing thug in Jack Cade's
gang, and Cade, agreeing, adds: ``Is not this a lamentable thing,
that of the skin of an innocent lamb should be made parchment? That
parchment, being scribbl'd o'er, should undo a man?''
</P>
<P>
   Thus did Shakespeare use irony to ridicule anti-intellectuals
who resent lawyers and writers. In the spirit of the season, let's
agree not to kill all the lawyers and scribblers. (Only a few, and
those metaphorically.)

DOES `PRINCE OF EGYPT' HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO BE A `LION KING'?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TODD CAMP 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The exodus of DreamWorks' ``The Prince of Egypt'' from page to
screen may not have endured locusts, frogs or fire, but it did
survive one of the fiercest plagues of all: the media.
</P>
<P>
   When rumors of an animated musical based on the Ten Commandments
began circulating a few years ago, naysayers went into overdrive,
dubbing the seemingly ridiculous notion ``Dreamworks' The Zion
King.''
</P>
<P>
   And even as the movie prepares to open Friday, doubts persist:
Will animation fans sit still for a more adult-themed, dramatic
story? After Jeffrey Katzenberg's departure from Disney, can he
hope to wrench a piece of the animation pie from the monster Mouse
he helped create? Considering Disney's run-ins with the Religious
Right, can an animated film (a medium not known for faithfulness to
source material) adequately adapt a story from the Bible? And most
importantly, what do you mean there are no Moses action figures?
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg and company certainly hope to provide satisfying
answers to allthose queries with their animated epic, which may
have cost as much as $100-plus million to make.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Katzenberg, Steven Spielberg and David Geffen formed
DreamWorks SKG in 1994, Spielberg had suggested the idea of an
animated movie based on the Old Testament story of Moses. Geffen
agreed, with reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be one of the single greatest pieces of advice I've
ever had in my professional career,'' Katzenberg said. ``David
said, `Jeffrey, when you were at Disney, your tradition was take
these fairy tales and adapt them to do what you wanted to. ... You
changed the stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't do that with this. If you're going to tell the story
... one, you will have to do it faithfully; two, you will have to
do it accurately; three, you don't know anything about it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So Katzenberg and producer Penney Finkelman Cox set out to find
the folks who did. They traveled the world, consulting more than
500 archaeologists, Egyptologists, scholars, theologians, biblical
experts and clergy.
</P>
<P>
   Cox said myriad experts corrected inaccuracies and eliminated
anachronisms, a move that was often criticized in the entertainment
press as an attempt to appease religious groups.
</P>
<P>
   But making a film based on the religious beliefs of millions of
people meant the filmmakers had to take a little more
responsibility than animated films have been noted for taking.
Disney's revisionist history in ``Pocahontas,'' its racial
stereotypes in ``Aladdin'' or its forced happy endings in any of
its adapted fairy tales just wouldn't wash with a retelling of the
Book of Exodus.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain formulas that we just threw out because they
just didn't apply to this movie,'' said Cox.
</P>
<P>
   As pundits in magazines like ``Entertainment Weekly'' and
``Premiere'' delightedly point out, the absence of a cartoon
formula favorite _ the wacky, cuddly sidekick _ might make the
picture a hard sell for younger viewers. Katzenberg says the
filmmakers grappled with the idea, even taking Steve Martin's and
Martin Short's voicing of the Pharaoh's court magicians much more
over the top. But it didn't work, so they went back to a more
serious tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would even be more risky if they had tried to
introduce those kind of characters in something as sacred as a
Bible story,'' said Fox Animation's Gary Goldman. Goldman has some
experience with audience fickleness, considering the disappointing
performance last year of Fox's ``Anastasia,'' which he co-produced
and directed. But Goldman says that, based on the success of Pat
Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network anchored by ``The 700
Club,'' Christian households are a vastly untapped market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine too many homes, whether they're Jewish homes
or Christian homes, that wouldn't want that in their library ...
because it's educational and serious, yet entertaining,'' he said.
``But our fingers are crossed for him (Katzenberg) to have a hit
there. We need to break this concept that Disney are the only
people that can create a satisfying animated product.''
</P>
<P>
   But Disney is credited with re-invigorating the genre, and along
the way moviegoers have been programmed to believe that animation
is aimed at the young. And what better way to dominate young
viewers than by flooding the market with a tidal wave of tie-in
toys? But don't look for ``The Prince of Egypt'' locust farm at
Toys R Us. You won't find it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say, `How come there are no lunch pails or stuffed
animals?' Because we didn't make a movie that has that stuff,''
Katzenberg said. ``... I think when you see it, you'll understand
this is not a candidate for a Happy Meal.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, ``The Prince of Egypt'' will focus on things like its
three soundtracks, 25 books and educational opportunities within
its multi-denominational study guides. (They're due online in
mid-December at princeofegypt.com.)
</P>
<P>
   Story and marketing approaches alone weren't enough to
distinguish DreamWorks from the Disney mold. Katzenberg says the
look of the film was crucial, prompting the DreamWorks artists to
come up with a visual approach he dubs ``painted realism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to bring paintings to life. It's not live-action and
it's not cartooning. It's dramatic, the characters are
three-dimensional. We're hoping that 15 seconds into the movie, you
actually relate to them as human beings, not as caricatures, not as
cartoons,'' Katzenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether audiences relate to ``Prince'' at all remains to be
seen, but even an unlikely box-office bath won't spell Armageddon
for DreamWorks animation any time soon. The surprise success of its
computer-animated ``Antz'' was a shot in the arm, and the studio is
already hip deep in ``The Road to El Dorado,'' an animated ``Butch
Cassidy and the Sundance Kid''-inspired comedy due in November.

BIOLOGISTS CLOSE IN ON THE TICK-TOCK GENES 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By SANDRA BLAKESLEE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a widely reported and strange-sounding experiment last
spring, scientists at Cornell University reported that they had
been able to reset human biological clocks by shining intense light
on the backs of people's knees. Weird as it sounded, however, this
was only one in a burst of stunning experiments that are disclosing
new insights into the ways that biological organisms keep and tell
time.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have found that plants, insects and animals have
basically the same genes for regulating their biological clocks _
built-in timers that tell an organism when each day begins and
ends. Human clocks control changes in body temperature, blood
pressure, mental alertness and a slew of other rhythms. Plant
clocks reveal when it is dawn or dusk and time to grow or rest.
Insect clocks guide feeding behavior and a host of other functions
that help bugs survive.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even more astonishingly, these genes and the proteins
they make are active in nearly every cell of every organism
studied. That is, they are ticking away in every petal, leaf and
stalk; in every wing, thorax and antenna; in every brain, muscle
and skin cell of the human body.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clocks are everywhere,'' said Dr. Aziz Sancar, a biochemist at
the University of North Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill,
who has carried out several of the groundbreaking experiments. It
seems that nature preserves what works, Sancar said.
</P>
<P>
   Papers describing these discoveries have appeared in several
prestigious scientific journals. Eighteen months ago very little
was known about the genetics of biological clocks. ``Now we have at
least six genes and more on the horizon,'' said Dr. Joseph
Takahashi, head of the Center for Biological Timing at Northwestern
University in Evanston, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have long theorized that human body rhythms, such as
the feeling of being sleepy or awake, are governed by a master
internal clock that sits deep in the brain. Its activity causes
hormones to be released throughout the body, affecting all cyclical
functions. The new experiments _ which involve finding potential
clock genes from huge banks of DNA sequence information and
knocking those genes out of plants, flies and mice to see what
happens _ are aimed at shedding light on the details of how this
clock tells time and maintains rhythms throughout the rest of the
body.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, biologists theorize, a pigment has to sense light
and transmit that signal to a clock, which in turn oscillates in a
24-hour cycle, and which in turn controls other genes that
establish rhythms throughout the organism.
</P>
<P>
   The first puzzle is finding how light is detected and how it
gets collected, Sancar said. For that, one needs photoreceptors _
molecules on the surface of a cell that are activated by light _
and what better place to look, at least in animals, than the eye.
The back of the retina has a rich layer of photoreceptors called
opsins, he said. They detect light and colors and send those
signals to visual areas in the brain.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, researchers felt that the same or similar receptors
were responsible for collecting light and sending signals to the
master clock, called the suprachiasmatic nucleus. The trouble is,
no one could ever find those receptors, Sancar said. Mice whose
visual photoreceptors are destroyed by disease still have circadian
rhythms. Many blind people with no conscious perception of light
have normal biological clocks.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone was stumped, Sancar said. Then, in 1993, a clue to the
puzzle emerged from an unlikely source. Dr. Anthony Cashmore of the
University of Pennsylvania isolated a plant gene, called
cryptochrome, that responded to blue light _ the kind most abundant
early in the morning or at dusk.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Sancar was studying an enzyme, found in many
organisms, that repairs DNA and that is activated by blue light. In
combing through genome sequences, Sancar found a snippet of human
DNA that was very similar to his blue light-activated enzyme. But
humans did not seem to have this repair mechanism, he said, so he
and his colleagues wanted to find out what this gene did. They
isolated the gene, grew it in a common bacterium and extracted the
protein made by the gene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indeed, it was not a repair enzyme,'' Sancar said. ``It was
very close to the cryptochrome found in plants. I thought, what
else do humans do with light? We use it for seeing and for
synchronizing our circadian clocks. And so in 1996, I suggested
these proteins are involved in the human circadian clock.''
</P>
<P>
   This idea was widely rejected, Takahashi said, until the recent
experiments manipulating crypto-chrome genes in plants, flies and
mice proved Sancar to be correct. For example, a mouse that is
missing the cryptochrome 2 gene will run on a wheel at odd hours,
showing its clock mechanism has been damaged. Mutated fruit flies
show similar dysfunctions.
</P>
<P>
   Further tests showed that cryptochrome 1 and 2 genes are
actively expressed throughout the mammalian body, in muscle, skin,
brain and eye. The retina has 10 layers, Sancar said, with opsins
in the back-most region. Cryptochrome 1 and 2 are expressed near
the front of the retina and may be spared in many forms of human
blindness. They seem to play a major role in setting biological
clocks, he said, by detecting blue light. When activated, they send
impulses to the master clock, which sets biological rhythms.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The second part of the puzzle _ how does the master clock keep
time _ has been solved by Takahashi and others. In flies and mice,
the scientists had identified four genes (and their four respective
proteins) that regulate each other in a loop lasting 24 hours. Two
of the genes turn on the activity of the other two. The way it
works is that the activated genes produce proteins, which turn off
the activating genes. Once the genes are activated, these proteins
slowly accumulate over a 12-hour period and are then reabsorbed
into the nucleus, where they turn off the first two activating
genes. Once these proteins are depleted, the cycle begins anew.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a surprisingly simple clock,'' Takahashi said. ``Two
genes are activators and two are inhibitors'' working in concert.
</P>
<P>
   The third part of the puzzle is better understood, at least in
humans. Signals travel from the master clock to the pineal gland
and other centers that release hormones throughout the body. These
hormones regulate cycles at the tissue level. The whereabouts of a
central clock in plants and insects is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   But a bigger mystery remains for humans: What are all these
time-keeping genes and proteins doing in skin and muscle cells?
``We are ticking all over our bodies,'' Takahashi said. ``In my
view, the suprachiasmatic nucleus is still the master pacemaker.
All these peripheral clocks may work in a hierarchy similar to the
heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each heart cell can beat intrinsically but the heart functions
as a synchronous whole with a single pacemaker to drive the system.
The same may be true for the circadian system. Besides, there is no
good evidence of feedback from the periphery to the master clock.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, scientists at Cornell University had their shining
success last spring when they showed that human biological clocks
could be reset at the back of the knee. If this experiment can be
replicated by other scientists, researchers will need to explain
how the light signal is carried from skin cells to brain cells. The
pigments in blood are among the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the new findings may have practical value. ``If
we know the genes that make up the clock, there should be drugs
that target the clock alone and not the rest of the body,''
Takahashi said. ``This may be useful in treating insomnia caused by
defects in the clock system.''
</P>
<P>
   Sancar has another suggestion. Opsins use vitamin A as a
cofactor, which is why people are told to eat carrots for good
vision. But cryptochromes use vitamin B2 as a cofactor in absorbing
light, he said. Thus vitamin B2 might be helpful to some people in
treating jet lag, depression and other problems linked to
biological clocks that are out of whack.

IRELAND TO RECONSIDER POLITY OF NEUTRALITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN _ The government is moving cautiously but unmistakably
toward a relaxation of Ireland's bedrock national policy: the
military neutrality it has proudly maintained since gaining
independence from Britain 76 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The change is being pressed by Foreign Minister David Andrews,
whose governing political party, Fianna Fail (Warriors of Destiny),
has always denounced any move away from strict neutrality as
disloyal to Ireland, if not treasonous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a hugely emotional issue,'' said Fergus Finlay, a
political consultant and former senior official in the Foreign
Affairs Department. ``For neutrality, read independence. For an
awful lot of people neutrality is the cornerstone of our foreign
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Andrews, in a series of national radio and television
interviews and newspaper articles, is arguing that Ireland's
neutrality should be reconsidered to permit the country to join the
U.S.-sponsored Partnership for Peace, a group of nations that do
not belong to NATO but have agreed to coordinate military polices
with it.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews said the government would decide on the issue next year
and that the decision could lead to a referendum on neutrality.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials and diplomats say the government will try to
avoid a referendum by arguing that one is needed only if Ireland's
neutrality is threatened, and that the association with NATO is not
such a threat.
</P>
<P>
   The shift away from strict neutrality has been urged on Ireland
for several years by the United States and by Ireland's European
neighbors. In 1994, the U.S. ambassador to NATO, Robert Hunter,
visited Dublin to urge top Irish officials to join the NATO
program, which falls short of full membership.
</P>
<P>
   When the new U.S. ambassador, Dan Sullivan, arrives in Dublin in
January, he is expected to restate the White House view that
Ireland should join the partnership. It is not that the
12,000-strong Irish Army would play a major role in a big European
war. It would continue to act as a peacekeeper, as the 700 Irish
troops are doing now in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sense, U.S. and European diplomats say, Ireland owes
allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   After remaining neutral in World War II, Ireland received the
protection of the U.S. nuclear umbrella during the Cold War. At the
same time, it received about $30 billion in development aid from
the European Union. While 40,000 Irish volunteers fought in the
British Army in World War II, many Irish men and women recall, some
with shame, that on the death of Hitler in 1945 Prime Minister
Eamon de Valera signed a condolence book at the German Embassy in
Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   He later maintained that at the time, unlike other European
leaders, he did not know of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Neutrality has had a deep impact on modern Ireland. De Valera's
decision to keep Ireland neutral, which enraged British Prime
Minister Winston Churchill, was based, historians say, on a fear
that there would be public disorder, if not civil war, if Irish
troops were ordered to fight with those of Britain, the despised
colonial power in Ireland until 1922.
</P>
<P>
   Some historians say that because Northern Ireland, as a British
province, sent tens of thousands of troops to the war, the result
was a tightening of the political union between London and the
Protestant-dominated North. This, in turn, made it politically
difficult for Britain to agree to negotiations giving the
overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Irish Republic more influence in
Northern Ireland's affairs. The new Northern Ireland peace
agreement approved in the spring tries to solve that problem.
</P>
<P>
   Enemies of any relaxation of neutrality include fringe
nationalists who have argued that the partnership would lead to
British soldiers ordering Irish troops in battle, or even in
barracks in Ireland. Other opponents include the Green Party, which
delights in pointing out that the Unites States has not paid its
full U.N. dues and that this slows down payments to the Irish Army
for its service in Lebanon. Officials acknowledge that the army
makes a profit from peacekeeping. Some 40 Irish soldiers are
expected to go to Kosovo as part of a peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people would see the partnership as a steppingstone to
NATO,'' Finlay said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews wrote in The Irish Times that ``as a voluntary,
nonbinding security framework based on cooperation'' the
partnership has been joined by ``all the other European neutral
nations, Austria, Finland, Sweden and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not entail membership of any alliance,'' he added.
``and since a country which goes to such enormous lengths to defend
its neutrality, such as Switzerland, has no difficulty
participating, I do not believe that the case against our
participation on these grounds is persuasive.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Nature is like Henny Youngman: She writes great jokes, and then
flogs them again and again. Take the spiny anteater of Australia,
the pangolin of Africa, and the giant anteater of Latin America
(please!). Each of these mammals has a long, sticky, worm-like
tongue, no teeth to speak of and scimitar claws.
</P>
<P>
   Each has bulging salivary glands, a stomach as rugged as a
cement mixer and an absurd, extenuated, hairless snout that looks
like a cross between a hot dog and a swizzle stick.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their many resemblances, the three creatures are wildly
unrelated to one another; the spiny anteater, in fact, lays eggs
and is a close cousin of the duck-billed platypus. What has yoked
them into morphological similitude is a powerful and boundlessly
enticing process called evolutionary convergence.
</P>
<P>
   By the tenet of convergence, there really is a best approach and
an ideal set of tools for grappling with life's most demanding
jobs. The spiny anteater, pangolin and giant anteater all subsist
on a diet of ants and termites, and myrmecophagy, it turns out, is
a taxing, specialized trade. As a result, the predecessors of
today's various ant hunters gradually, and quite independently,
converged on the body plan most suited to exploit a food resource
that violently resists exploitation.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists from Charles Darwin onward have been aware of
convergent evolution and described examples of it with fascination
and joy: the architectural parallelism of the wings of the bat, the
bird, and the extinct pterodactyl, all having arisen independently
but all having resulted from a similar modification of the
vertebrate forelimb; and the concordantly streamlined profile of
the shark _ a fish _ and the whale _ a descendant of a ratty,
wolflike land mammal.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, the study of evolutionary convergence has taken on a new
twist, as researchers look beyond such flamboyant cases of
anatomical homology to detect subtle instances of convergence among
molecules. They have found striking analogies between the
antifreeze proteins that allow two unrelated groups of fish
swimming on opposite ends of the globe to endure in icy waters.
</P>
<P>
   They have detected a bizarre form of antibody protein in species
as different as camels and sharks _ antibodies that look eerily
like each other, and unlike the antibodies of most vertebrate
creatures, yet that evolved their unorthodox proteinous
conformations along entirely autonomous pathways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Convergence is a really interesting part of the machinery of
evolution,'' said Dr. Rudolf A. Raff, an evolutionary developmental
biologist at the Molecular Biology Institute of Indiana University
in Bloomington. ``Convergences keep happening because organisms
keep wanting to do similar things, and there are only so many ways
of doing them, as dictated by physical laws.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of convergence also plays into a recent philosophical
debate between two prominent evolutionary biologists, Dr. Stephen
Jay Gould of Harvard University and Dr. Simon Conway Morris of
Cambridge University. In his best-selling book, ``Wonderful Life''
(W.W. Norton, 1989), about the discovery of the Burgess Shale, a
trove of 70,000 fossils half a billion years old, Gould emphasizes
the importance of what he calls contingency, the idea that many of
the species we see today are here by dint of a series of accidents
_ an asteroid that pelted the earth, for example, thereby
eliminating the dinosaurs and making way for the rise of mammals.
</P>
<P>
   If you could rewind the tape of life and run the whole program
over again, Gould said, you would end up with a radically different
set of organisms, one almost certainly devoid of anything as
cortically overendowed as we Homo sapiens are. He has criticized
many of his colleagues for engaging in what he considers to be
excessive adaptationist thinking, a ``Panglossian'' faith that the
fittest survive, that evolution invariably progresses from simple
to complex and from stupid to clever, and that what is, is for the
best.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, however, Dr. Conway Morris, one of the
discoverers of the Burgess Shale, took issue with many of Gould's
ideas in a new book, ``The Crucible of Creation'' (Oxford
University Press). Rewinding the tape of life may not result in
such a drastic change, Morris insisted, one reason being the
principle of convergence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would certainly not contest the reality of contingency and
luck,'' Morris said recently in a telephone interview. ``We're all
the product of one very, very lucky sperm. On the other hand, when
you look at the broad structure of the history of life, you can't
help but be impressed by the number of organisms that began at
different starting points and have come together _ the whale that
looks like a fish, an extinct marsupial, a sort of kangaroo, that
looked like a saber-toothed cat. The world is a rich and wonderful
place, but it is not one of untrammeled possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   The relative degree to which the world's fauna and flora have
been shaped either by contingency or by the slow hand of natural
selection, as expressed most starkly in cases of convergent
evolution, remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that the more scientists look, the more
examples of convergence they find. Sometimes the reasons for a
particular convergence are easy to parse. Consider the shared
traits of the world's manifold anteaters. Ants are tiny and must be
consumed en masse, said Dr. Kent Redford of the Wildlife
Conservation Society in the Bronx, who has studied anteating
mammals _ hence the need for a long sticky tongue to lap up
hundreds at a pop, and for enlarged salivary glands to help keep
the tongue gummy and to wash the ants down.
</P>
<P>
   For moving that long tongue in and out rapidly, a muzzle
improves the aim. And it is best for the snout to be hairless, to
make sure that the pincered ants and termites have nothing to grab
onto. Ants live in soil and sand, which requires powerful claws for
digging. There is need of a digestive system that can readily pass
the sand and dirt that will be lapped up with each tongueful of
food, and that can metabolize the blistering chemical defenses with
which ants and termites are loaded. Finally, sand grinds down
enamel, so teeth can be dispensed with altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty weird bioplan,'' Redford said, ``but it works.''
And the ultimate proof is sitting on his desk, in the form of a
newly issued Beanie Baby toy with a telltale tubular schnoz. ``Even
the Beanie Baby phylogeny now has an anteater in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other cases of convergence are not so readily explained. Pamela
Groves, a research associate at the University of Alaska's
Institute of Arctic Biology in Fairbanks, has compared the musk ox
of northern North America with the takin of China. Both are members
of a large ungulate subfamily that includes sheep and goats, and
biologists had long assumed that the two species were closely
related, for they have several peculiar features in common.
</P>
<P>
   They are both the biggest and most barrel-chested members of the
subfamily, and have unusual horns that grow out of the center of
the forehead and hook off to the side. They also display an
exceptional form of group defense behavior when confronted by a
predator. Rather than bounding off in the manner of goats or
gazelles, they instead fall with military precision into a circle
formation, the adults facing outward, their sharp-tipped horns at a
ready, and the young safely sequestered within the center.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   That the takin practice group defense is particularly
surprising; the animals live in the dense vegetation of remote
mountain regions, and as a rule herbivores in such environments
tend to be solitary and rely on forest cover rather than herd life
for protection.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, biologists had proposed that the takin and musk ox were
descendants of a common ancestor, which arose in Asia under
different habitat conditions than exist today and then radiated
into North America across the Bering strait about 20,000 tears ago,
during the Pleistocene.
</P>
<P>
   But in a recent DNA analysis of the two species, published in
the journal of Molecular and Phylogenetic Evolution, Dr. Groves
found that the animals are not close kin after all, but in fact
diverged from one another nearly 10 million years ago, long, long
before the Pleistocene.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how I analyzed the data, the results always showed
the musk ox and takin had other species that were genetically more
similar to them than they were to each other,'' she said. ``So why
all the resemblances? My theory, after pondering it for a while, is
that this is another example of convergent evolution.''
</P>
<P>
   How the convergence occurred, though, and what the selective
pressures were that resulted in each species having big bodies, the
same sort of horn structure and the same circling-the-wagons
approach to defense, she cannot say.
</P>
<P>
   Equally piquant are some of the recent discoveries of molecular
convergence. Dr. Kenneth H. Roux, a structural biologist at Florida
State University in Tallahassee, and his colleagues recently
described in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences a
baffling similarity between certain antibody proteins in camelids _
the group that includes camels and llamas _ and nurse sharks.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout most of the animal kingdom, the antibodies of the
immune system are built of two types of chains, called heavy and
light, and each chain is composed of three loops. Together the
triple-looped heavy and light chains allow an antibody to attach to
a foreign object like a virus and begin the process of destroying
the enemy. But in camels and nurse sharks, a subset of antibodies
have lost their light chains: All three loops are missing, and only
the three loops of the heavy chains remain.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists cannot say why the loss occurred in the first
place, whether by accident or by unfathomable selective design. In
any event, the antibodies of the camels and the nurse sharks
responded to the change in cognate ways. To compensate for their
absence of light chains, both animals expanded the size of one of
the loops in their heavy chains. Remarkably, it is the same loop
that has been lengthened in both the camel and the nurse shark
antibodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a case of structural convergence,'' Roux said. ``If this
wasn't the only solution to the problem, it was certainly the most
efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   The unorthodox antibodies of the sharks and camels may look and
act alike, but the genetic subunits that encode the proteins are
decidely dissimilar from one another _ that is, they have different
amino acid sequences. Many combinations of amino acids can be
strung together to construct proteins that behave in nearly
identical ways.
</P>
<P>
   For statistical reasons, though, said Dr. Russell F. Doolittle,
a molecular evolutionist at the University of California at San
Diego, true sequence convergence _ where two independently evolved
proteins not only perform the same task but have the same
underlying building blocks _ is likely to be extremely rare.
</P>
<P>
   But odds, like hearts and eggs, are made to be broken, and so
scientists recently announced what they think is the first
illustration of bona fide sequence convergence. Dr. Chi-Hing C.
Cheng of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and her
co-workers reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences on their analysis of antifreeze proteins found in two
groups of fish: the notothenioids of the Antarctic and the Northern
cod of the Arctic.
</P>
<P>
   The proteins help keep a fish's blood from freezing while it
swims through frigid waters by binding onto a bit of ingested
icicle and preventing the ice crystal from growing larger. A number
of polar-dwelling creatures have versions of antifreeze proteins,
and the sequences of these proteins are, as a rule, all over the
map.
</P>
<P>
   But in the case of the cod and the notothenioids, the antifreeze
molecules retain their resemblances down to their cores. They
consist of the same three amino acids _ threonine, alanine and
proline _ repeated over and over.
</P>
<P>
   In a painstaking series of experiments, Dr. Cheng and her
colleagues demonstrated that the proteins arrived at their
analogous sequences during entirely independent episodes of genetic
shuffling. The notothenioid protein arose about 7 million to 15
million years ago, when Antarctic oceans were chilling to freezing,
while the cod version probably evolved about 3 million years ago,
during the glaciation of the Arctic seas.
</P>
<P>
   The simplicity of the protein sequence, Dr. Cheng said, explains
how it was possible for it to have arisen on two separate
occasions. And the cod can be thankful that nature, at least, does
not believe in copyrights. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH (Washington) _ As the impeachment vote neared in the
House, several of President Clinton's few Republican supporters
began to waver Monday. Instead of conciliation, the White House
turned to the attack with Vice President Gore denouncing
Congressional Republicans for refusing to allow a vote on censure
and asserting they were thwarting the overwhelming will of the
nation. With photo. By Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-POLL (Washington) _ Even after the House Judiciary

Thursday's vote on the impeachment of President Clinton. Voters
have sent Hill aides into overdrive, clogging their phone lines,
maxing out their voice mails, draining dry the toner in their fax

</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-SCENE (Gaza City) _ The band left something to be
desired. The honor guard could have been criser and more precise.
But from the immense American and Palestinian flags draped from the
airport's control tower to the joint appearance by two leaders at
which reporters shouted questions about impeachment, the day had
all the feel of a typical state visit by President Clinton. Yet one

 &HT;    THE LOGIC OF DEMANDING A CLINTON CONFESSION
 &HT;    450&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fence-sitting members of Congress argued Monday
that it is not illogical to demand that President Clinton admit to
an impeachable offense in order to win their votes against
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at it much like a defendant in a court trial,''
explained Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   If the accused criminal admits his guilt and asks for
forgiveness, the judge can impose less than the maximum penalty,
Foley said. If the defendant remains unrepentant and refuses to
concede the wrongdoing, the judge can hand out a stiffer sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens every day in a courtroom setting,'' said Foley, who
is among more than three dozen undeclared members from both
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these have expressed dismay that Clinton still sticks to
his claim of having testified truthfully _ at least technically _
in his deposition in the Paula Jones lawsuit and before Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr's federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the president can do is to deal with the reality of what
he has done to confront the truth. Two simple words, 'I lied,'
would have gone a long way,'' said Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., in an
appearance on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do is to fix what the truth is _ not to
have a degradation of what the truth is, because it impacts on the
dignity of the presidency, the dignity of Congress, and the dignity
of our country,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Another of these moderates, Rep. Bob Franks, R-N.J., wrote a
letter to the president last week warning that he was inclined to
support an article of impeachment charging perjury unless Clinton
comes forward and admits that he lied under oath.
</P>
<P>
   The first Democrat to urge Clinton to resign, Rep. Paul McHale
of Pennsylvania, has said he would oppose impeachment if the
president would just admit to lying.
</P>
<P>
   The seeming contradiction _ demanding a guilty plea in exchange
for a vote of acquittal _ has not been lost on some veteran Capitol
Hill observers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has really puzzled me,'' said Norman Ornstein, a
congressional expert with the American Enterprise Institute. ``It
would seem to me that a member of the House has two duties in this
situation. One, determine for yourself what you believe that the
president did. Second, determine for yourself whether what he did
constitutes an impeachable offense. What he says about it should be
completely immaterial.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The logical explanation is that they're looking for an
excuse'' to give their constituents for a no-win vote, Ornstein
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good out. You know (Clinton) is not going to'' admit
lying under oath, said Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the
University of Virginia. ``So it's probably good cover'' for an
impeachment vote, he said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Sabato said Clinton's stubbornness reminds him of President
Reagan during the Iran-contra scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reagan insisted to the end _ and probably insists to this day
_ that he did not trade arms for hostages although it was obvious
that he did,'' said Sabato. ``Clinton insists that he did not lie
under oath, although it's obvious that he did.''
</P>
<P>
   But some members insist that Clinton must confess perjury before
they will consider a vote against impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Louisiana, people have great compassion and great affection
for repentant politicians,'' said Ken Johnson, a spokesman for Rep.
Billy Tauzin, R-La.
</P>
<P>
   For Rep. Bob Ney, R-Ohio, though, it is ``too late'' for the
president to say anything that could affect his vote on
impeachment, said Ney's spokesman, Neil Volz. Ney believes Clinton
committed perjury and is now weighing whether this perjury rises to
the level of an impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   But Ney thinks still Clinton should come completely clean ``for
the good of the country,'' said Volz.

DOCUMENT FOUND ON BRITISH DOCTOR'S STUDY OF SOUTH SEA BONES 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(rl) 
 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sixty-one years after Amelia Earhart's plane disappeared over
the Pacific Ocean while the celebrated aviator was seeking to fly
around the world, people still clamor for hints about her fate and,
once again, something has turned up to whet their appetites.
</P>
<P>
   The latest trail of detective work, conducted by volunteers from
the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery, based in
Delaware, has led to an official document in London describing a
lost collection of weather-beaten bone fragments.
</P>
<P>
   The bones themselves have vanished but are known to have been
found in 1940 by a British colonial official visiting Nikumaroro
Island (then called Gardner Island), an uninhabited atoll in the
Phoenix group, about 600 miles north of Samoa and about 400 miles
southeast of Howland Island _ the destination she never reached. He
thought they might be from Amelia Earhart.
</P>
<P>
   Various contemporary accounts say the bones, including part of a
skull and several long bones, were buried or thrown into the sea or
even transferred to a medical museum in Fiji.
</P>
<P>
   But a British doctor, Dr. D.W. Hoodless of the Central Medical
School in Suva, Fiji, measured them in 1941 before they
disappeared, and members of the aircraft recovery group found the
late doctor's record of his measurements last year while searching
government archives in London.
</P>
<P>
   Two forensic anthropologists, Karen Ramey Burns of the
University of North Carolina and Richard Jantz of the University of
Tennessee, compared Hoodless' 57-year-old measurements with a large
database compiled from thousands of skeletons and widely used by
forensic osteologists. A similar forensic technique is used to
identify the bones of crime victims.
</P>
<P>
   They concluded in a report presented at a meeting of the
American Anthropological Association that because of uncertainties
about Hoodless' proficiency as an anatomist and his measuring
technique, his records had to be ``treated with caution.'' But if
his measurements were accurate, they said, the subject was more
likely to be a woman than a man, a European rather than a
Polynesian, and between 5 feet 6 inches and 5 feet 7 inches tall.
</P>
<P>
   This and some other circumstantial evidence seemed interesting
enough to organizers of the anthropological association that the
association acted as host for a news conference in Philadelphia
presented by the recovery group.
</P>
<P>
   Chances that the Earhart mystery is nearing solution seem
remote, however. Most experts still believe that Earhart and her
navigator, Fred Noonan, simply crashed into the Pacific about
midway between Australia and Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   This view is shared by Earhart's niece, Amy Kleppner, an
11th-grade teacher in Montgomery County, Md.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've read everything written and reported about my aunt,''
Mrs. Kleppner said in an interview, ``and I'm convinced that she
and Fred simply ran out of gas within 100 miles of their
destination, Howland Island. No one has produced credible evidence
that their plane crashed on any of the Phoenix Islands, or that
they died of starvation, or that they were captured, tortured and
killed by the Japanese on Saipan, or any of the other theories. The
simplest explanation is the most likely.''
</P>
<P>
   Earhart and her navigator had completed more than half of their
trip around the world when their last radio transmission was heard
on July 2, 1937, 20 hours and 14 minutes after they had taken off
from Lae, New Guinea, on the 2,556-mile ocean leg to Howland
Island. From position reports radioed by Earhart, experts have
concluded that she was fighting strong headwinds and was probably
far behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Since then speculation about their fate has been endless, and an
Earhart cult has continued to thrive; an Internet browser cites at
least 136 Web sites devoted to or concerning Earhart.
</P>
<P>
   Facts remain scarce, but experts in navigation, forensic
anthropology and aircraft history, as well as many rank amateurs,
are still finding scraps of putative evidence from the sands of
remote islands and from documents in obscure archives.
</P>
<P>
   In previous years, Richard Gillespie, executive director of the
international recovery group, has recovered fragments from
Nikumaroro of a shoe and a Cat's Paw replacement heel of 1930s
vintage, which he says resembles one shown in a photograph of
Earhart a few days before she disappeared. Gillespie's group also
found a piece of aluminum sheet about the size of a serving tray
and a curved shard of Plexiglas like that used in aircraft windows.
But no serial numbers or other identification marks have been found
that could positively link these or other artifacts to Earhart's
death or her twin-engine Lockheed Model 10 Electra.
</P>
<P>
   Although the island was uninhabited in 1937 and is uninhabited
today, there were periods during and after World War II when it was
occupied by Americans and Polynesian workers, who could have
brought items of clothing and metal with them.
</P>
<P>
   Gillespie said he planned to lead a full-scale expedition to
Nikumaroro in the spring of 2000 to comb the 4-mile-long atoll and
its lagoon for artifacts and bone fragments. The latter, he said,
might still contain DNA that could be compared with that of Mrs.
Kleppner, Earhart's niece.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Merriwether, a physical anthropologist from Britain who
attended the meeting, said it was unlikely that DNA could be
preserved in weathered bones over such a long period, but he said a
tooth, which contains a protected pulp cavity, might contain usable
DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kleppner said she would not decide whether or not to make
her own DNA available for matching until and unless suspected bones
of her aunt should be found.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Crouch, senior curator of the Smithsonian Institution's Air
and Space Museum, regards this as unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statistical analysis of those old measurements by Dr.
Hoodless is the most interesting thing the Tighar group has done,''
Crouch said. ``But there is not a shred of evidence specifically
linking anything on Nikumaroro with Amelia Earhart. The shoe
fragments are two sizes larger than anything Amelia wore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The odds are 100 to 1 that Amelia and Fred came to rest on the
ocean floor.''

   Meanwhile, a fisherman's discovery in the Mediterranean Sea of a
silver bracelet has touched off another search. The bracelet,
pulled up in a net 20 miles from Marseilles in September, was
identified as that of Antoine de Saint-Exupery, author of ``The
Little Prince'' and some memorable aviation novels. St. Exupery
disappeared in 1944 while piloting a P-38 Lightning fighter on a
reconnaissance mission against German forces. So far, a search of
the sea near Marseilles has failed to find wreckage from the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand the interest of many people in famous
aviators like my aunt who disappeared mysteriously,'' Mrs. Kleppner
said. ``I was just a child of 5 when I last saw her and have very
little recollection of her. But there were others who were never
found, and it's natural to wonder how they died.''
</P>
<P>
   Among them were the war hero Charles Nungesser and Francois Coli
who disappeared in 1927 trying to be the first to cross the
Atlantic Ocean, and at least four others who defied the Atlantic at
about the same time. In 1928, the great Polar explorer Roald
Amundsen disappeared while aboard a seaplane in the Arctic Ocean
searching for survivors of the crashed airship Italia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Searches for the traces of people like them are exciting, even
if fruitless,'' Mrs. Kleppner said.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of Monday afternoon, temperatures in Jacksonville,
Fla., hovered in the middle 50s with light rain falling. Tuesday,
clouds and spotty rains will limit temperatures across the northern
two-thirds of the Florida peninsula as Atlantic moisture wraps
inland around an offshore low-pressure system. Clouds and rain will
extend farther north along the coast, affecting eastern sections of
Georgia, South Carolina and perhaps southeast North Carolina. Ocean
winds averaging 15 to 25 mph with higher gusts will prevail along
the Southeast Coast from Jacksonville to Charleston, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated showers and mountain snows will struggle to develop
over Arizona as a formidable but moisture-deprived Pacific low
swirls slowly inland. Thus, no organized areas of precipitation are
likely.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the low will still have significant impact on other
parts of the Southwest as the large contrasts in barometric
pressure between the low and a high over southern Idaho generate
strong winds from the east through the mountains of southern
California. These Santa Ana winds may gust to 50 mph or more at
times below narrow canyons.
</P>
<P>
   The northern Middle Atlantic states will be very chilly early
Tuesday morning with single-digit readings possible in the cold
micro climates of northern Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Farther
east, winds from the west averaging 15 to 25 mph will warm on
descent from the Appalachians, boosting afternoon temperatures in
eastern New England 10 to 15 degrees above average.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Tropical Storm Faith
</P>
<P>
   The Joint Typhoon Warning Center in Guam issued a final warning
for Tropical Storm Faith on Monday as the system marched toward its
demise over the mountains in southeast Vietnam. The tropical system
had been a typhoon on Sunday, with sustained winds over 100 mph
while over the open seas. Unlike the tropical Atlantic and eastern
Pacific basins, where hurricane season has ended, the western
Pacific never sleeps, with typhoon season spanning the entire year.
High sea-surface temperatures in this region are the primary factor
in the year-long risk of tropical storms.

MIT SCIENTISTS TURN SIMPLE IDEA INTO `PERFECT MIRROR'

 By BRUCE SCHECHTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A team of scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology recently announced what may be the most significant
advance in mirror technology since Narcissus became entranced by
his image reflected on the surface of a still pool of water.
</P>
<P>
   Their invention, which they are calling the ``perfect mirror''
because it combines the best features of the two previously known
types of mirrors, promises to have significant applications in many
fields, including fiber optics, cellular telephones, energy
conservation, medicine, spectroscopy and even, perhaps, cake
decoration.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very significant,'' said Dr. Eli Yablonovitch, a
physicist at the University of California at Los Angeles. ``There
are going to be some important applications.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by the MIT team was initially greeted with
disbelief by scientists, who for generations had been taught that
mirrors with the properties the team claimed were impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John D. Joannopoulos, a leader of the team that invented the
mirrors, had even published a ``proof'' of their impossibility in
his widely read textbook on the field. ``Goes to show how much I
know,'' Joannopoulos, an MIT physics professor, said with a grin,
conceding his mistake.
</P>
<P>
   But the basic idea behind the mirrors is so simple, depending on
no new physical insight or mathematical theory, physicists say,
that anyone who reads the MIT paper is quickly convinced of its
correctness. Writing about the discovery in Science magazine, Jon
Dowling, a physicist at the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, at the California
Institute of Technology said, ``Every once in a while someone comes
along with a great idea that in hindsight seems so trivial you
could kick yourself for not having thought of it first.''
</P>
<P>
   Mirrors come in two basic varieties. The most common are
metallic mirrors like those found on the walls of Versailles or on
medicine cabinets. Metallic mirrors work pretty well, but they have
limitations. The most important is that they waste energy,
absorbing a small fraction of the light that falls on them.
</P>
<P>
   That is because when light, which, like radio waves, is a form
of electromagnetic radiation, strikes a metallic mirror the
electrons in the metal move just as they do when a radio signal
strikes an antenna. Pushing electrons around takes energy, which
dims the reflected image. So metallic mirrors cannot be used in
applications like communications and high-powered lasers, where
minimizing energy loss is important.
</P>
<P>
   For applications in which energy loss is important scientists
depend on a more sophisticated device known as a dielectric mirror.
A dielectric is a material like glass or plastic, that does not
conduct electricity. Narcissus was actually enamored of his image
in a crude sort of dielectric mirror, because water is a
dielectric.
</P>
<P>
   But dielectrics like water or glass do not reflect light well,
so practical dielectric mirrors are made by stacking alternating
thin layers of two dielectrics. Every time light passes from one
layer to the next a little bit of it is reflected. If the
thicknesses of the layers are chosen carefully these reflected
light waves combine and reinforce one another, strengthening the
intensity of the reflected light. By stacking many layers
scientists can make mirrors that are nearly perfect reflectors.
</P>
<P>
   Another useful property of dielectric mirrors is that they can
be designed to reflect only a small range of frequencies and let
the rest pass unmolested. For example, dielectric mirrors can be
designed to reflect infrared light but transmit visible light.
Because infrared light is heat, dielectric mirror windows would
insulate a room from the heat of day without impeding the view. But
there is a problem.
</P>
<P>
   The main drawback is that standard dielectric mirrors, unlike
metallic mirrors, reflect only light that strikes them from a
limited range of angles. A dielectric window that blocked heat from
radiating from the sidewalk might only let in the oblique rays of
the noon sun. This limitation of dielectric mirrors has restricted
their use to specialized devices like lasers in which the light can
be constrained to strike at a known angle.
</P>
<P>
   Until the MIT team reported its findings, scientists believed
that this limitation of dielectric constants was an inconvenient
law of nature, regrettable but unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   Joannopoulos said the MIT team members realized by accident that
they might have overlooked something. Joshua Winn, a graduate
student, was playing with a computer model of a dielectric mirror
when he noticed that it seemed to be reflecting light at a much
larger angle than he had thought possible. Puzzled, he turned to
Shanhui Fan, a post-doctoral fellow in physics who came up with an
explanation. Satisfied, the two promptly filed it away as a
theoretical novelty and forgot it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the problem with being a theorist,'' Joannopoulos said.
``Being theorists, we tend to think in a different way.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Dr. Yoel Fink, a graduate student at MIT's Plasma
Fusion Science Center who was proficient in experiment and theory,
was wrestling with a project his lab was doing for the Defense
Advanced Research Agency. Maybe, he thought, a multilayered
dielectric mirror could be made to do the trick. He made the
suggestion at a large meeting.
</P>
<P>
   And the minute he did, Fink said, he saw Joannopoulos light up.
</P>
<P>
   Within three months, Fink had made the first mirror, completed
in February, from nine alternating layers of polystyrene _ a
plastic _ and tellurium. Measurements confirmed what theory had
predicted. The mirror reflected infrared light equally well from
all angles and as efficiently as the best metallic mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   For months the researchers lived in fear that something so
obvious had to be well-known.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could something about mirrors not be known?'' asked Dr.
Edwin L. Thomas, the other leader of the team and an MIT professor
of physical science and engineering. ``We had this feeling that
sooner or later somebody's going to walk up to us, tap us on the
shoulder and say, `Yeah, we knew this a hundred years ago.' But
apparently not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's going to be a lot of activity, with people
saying, `This is simple! It's not hard to make,' '' Thomas said. In
one early application the MIT group has rolled the mirrors into
spaghetti-thin tubes called ``omniguides.'' A beam of laser light
can be guided by such tubes far more efficiently than by fiber
optics because glass fibers absorb light. And, unlike fiber optics,
the omniguides can guide light around corners. In the operating
room such omniguides could precisely guide the light of the
powerful lasers surgeons use.
</P>
<P>
   Even more promising is the possibility of replacing conventional
fiber optics used in communications with omniguides. The absorption
of light by conventional glass fibers means that the signal must be
boosted every 20 kilometers or so. This requires amplifiers, which
only work in a narrow band of frequencies.
</P>
<P>
   Omniguides would carry light with far less loss of energy,
meaning they could stretch for thousands of miles without
amplifiers. Engineers would not be limited to a small band of
wavelengths by the abilities of amplifiers. ``You could have a
thousand times the bandwidth. That's a very big deal,'' Fan said.
</P>
<P>
   The MIT scientists also envision coating windows with infrared
reflecting mirrors to keep heat in or out of rooms. The mirrors
could be chopped into tiny flakes and mixed with transparent paint
to allow them to be applied directly to walls or windows. The MIT
mirrors could also be useful in improving thermophotovoltaic cells,
devices that trap waste heat and convert it to energy.
</P>
<P>
   Dowling suggested that, because the new mirrors could be made to
reflect radio waves, they could be used to boost the performance of
cellular telephones. Even the apparel industry could benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could use this type of stuff to make fiber and very light
weight clothing to keep the heat in,'' Joannopoulos speculated. ``I
think this could be really big,'' he said. ``We're limited only by
our imaginations.'' For the MIT team that is not a severe
limitation: Fink suggested, half seriously, that mirrors could be
made of edible materials to make reflective cake icing. ``Really,
what food do you know of that's highly reflective?''

WHEN COMPANIES ADVERTISE, LET VIEWERS BEWARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   How many of these words do you understand? Hepatic microsomal
enzyme induction, altered lacrimation, menorrhagia, hyperkinesia,
hypoesthesia and angioneurotic edema.
</P>
<P>
   If your doctor prescribed a drug and warned you about such side
effects, would you want to take it? Yet, these are among the scores
of possible adverse reactions listed in tiny print in a
many-thousand-word ``brief summary'' on the back side of a consumer
magazine advertisement for a popular prescription drug. The front
of the advertisement depicts an obviously pleased woman peering at
a blue sky and suggests that you ``ask your doctor for a trial of
once-a-day Claritin,'' a nonsedating antihistamine that can relieve
the symptoms of seasonal nasal allergies.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, consumers found out about prescription drugs
mainly from their doctors and occasionally from friends or
relatives who used them. Now, thanks to an easing of regulations
from the Food and Drug Administration, scores of drugs that were
once promoted only to doctors are now being promoted directly to
consumers in magazines and newspapers and on television and radio.
This year the pharmaceutical industry is expected to spend well
over $1 billion to try to persuade you to ask your doctor about a
prescription drug.
</P>
<P>
   The tactic has its benefits and risks, its champions and
detractors. Before asking your doctor to prescribe a drug you saw
advertised for your allergies, arthritis, asthma, atherosclerosis
or whatever might ail you, it pays to heed what the experts are
saying about these advertisements and how wise consumers should
respond to them.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent national telephone survey of 1,013 adults sponsored
by the National Consumers League, a nonprofit organization based in
Washington, 80 percent of those queried said that they had seen or
heard prescription drug advertising, and a majority said that it
provided useful information about a drug or the disease it was
designed to treat. Nearly half said they had talked to their
doctors about a drug they saw advertised, and a quarter said they
had consulted a doctor about the disease mentioned in an
advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   About 23 percent _ half those who asked about an advertised drug
_ said their doctors had prescribed it, but in 12 percent of cases,
the doctors said the drug was not appropriate. Perhaps most
significant to the patients involved, 29 percent said they were
helped by the discussion prompted by asking their doctors about an
advertised drug.
</P>
<P>
   As for the ``brief summary'' that lists indication and usage,
contraindications, warnings, precautions and adverse reactions,
nearly a third of those surveyed said they had read almost all of
it and a quarter said they looked at some of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is quite surprising,'' remarked Brett Kay, the league's
program associate for health policy. ``People tell you things that
they think you want to know. The fact is you can barely see and
understand the brief summary on most ads because the print is so
small and the information is so technical. It's written for
doctors, not for consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Ostrove, chief of marketing practices and communications
for the Food and Drug Administration, said an increasing number of
drug advertisers are now using more consumer-friendly language in
the brief summary.
</P>
<P>
   In Kay's view, the brief summary should be less detailed and
convey useful information in language a lay person can understand,
and the print has to be large enough to be legible without a
magnifying glass. He added that a drug advertisement should not
imply uses beyond what the drug is approved for, and should provide
sufficient information on the drug's effectiveness, dosages, safety
and potential risks. Benefits and Risks
</P>
<P>
   Those who defend direct drug advertising say it can improve
health care by alerting patients to medical problems that warrant
medical attention, and by alerting people to the availability of
new or existing drugs for a problem they thought was untreatable.
Based on the results of a national telephone survey of 1,200
adults, Prevention Magazine concluded that direct-to-consumer drug
advertising can be ``an extremely effective means of promoting both
the public health and prescription medicines.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, sales of advertised drugs have risen significantly, and
many patients have said that in response to such advertisements,
they sought medical care for symptoms they had not previously
realized could be readily treated effectively.
</P>
<P>
   For example, advertising of cholesterol-lowering drugs called
statins may help save lives by bringing patients into treatment. At
least four major studies have shown that statins can reduce cardiac
deaths by 24 percent to 42 percent, but only about a third of the
13 million Americans with heart disease symptoms are now taking
them, and an additional 16 million with no symptoms but with
significantly elevated cholesterol levels are not being treated.
</P>
<P>
   But some experts say that in a society already overmedicated,
prescription drug advertisements can only compound the problem of
patients' demanding prescriptions when other measures, like diet
and exercise, should be tried first.
</P>
<P>
   Another complaint involves the time it may take doctors to tell
patients why an advertised drug is unsuitable for them. Patients
may end up disappointed or even distrustful of their doctors. Yet,
doctors are more likely to know of drug alternatives that may be
safer, cheaper or more effective.
</P>
<P>
   Some patients may become overly enthusiastic about a drug in
response to a fanciful advertisement, like the one for an AIDS drug
that depicts people equipped with sporting gear admiring the view
from a mountaintop. Prescription drugs advertised in a 30-second
television commercial can only hint at the true benefits and risks,
referring patients to a Web site, a toll-free number, a print
advertisement or their doctors or pharmacists for further
information.
</P>
<P>
   To help assure that consumers get appropriate medical care, Dr.
Gene Reeder of the University of South Carolina's College of
Pharmacy offers this advice:
</P>
<P>
   _Talk first to your pharmacist about a drug that interests you.
The pharmacist is likely to be easier to reach than your doctor and
know more about the drug and its possible interactions with other
medicines.
</P>
<P>
   _Do not insist on a particular drug, no matter how suitable it
may sound.
</P>
<P>
   _Make sure that whoever prescribes any drug knows your full
medical history and is aware of the other drugs and
over-the-counter supplements you take.
</P>
<P>
   _Be sure you fully understand the nature of the drug and its
possible side effects. Don't be swayed by glossy advertising.
Remember, a drug is not a box of cereal or a candy bar; its
potential risks and benefits are far greater.

   MIDEAST-CLINTON _ GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip _ In his most dramatic
speech on foreign policy, President Clinton Monday told the
Palestinian people they are free to ``determine their own destiny
on their own land.'' He then witnessed a Palestine National Council
vote annulling parts of the Palestinian charter that deny Israel's
right to exist. That action quickly met with the approval of
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. It was the first visit
to Palestinian-controlled territory by an American president, and
Clinton applauded PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat for making bold moves
toward peace with Israel and said it was time to think harder about
ways to cement the peace and ensure a more prosperous future for
all Palestinians. Developing. (Deans, Cox News Service 800).

   GAZA-SCENE _ In one of the many refugee camps here, a Hamas
family watches Monday's historic events; American President Bill
Clinton on the television, a picture of the radical Palestinian
group Hamas' chief bomb-maker on the wall. They are a clear example
of the new Palestinian view of Clinton and the United States, as
U.S. flags were draped all over, offices were closed and thousands
of people holding American flags for the first time without burning
them crowded the streets. Will also include general reaction from
Palestinian leaders to Clinton visit. Developing. (Kaplow, Cox News
Service).

<P>
   IMPEACH _ From the Gaza Strip Clinton says he's looking for a
``reasonable compromise with Congress'' to avoid impeachment.
Meanwhile, one of a handful of anti-impeachment Republicans in the
House today signaled a possible shift in position and asked for a
face-to-face conversation with President Clinton to discuss his
case. ``If I had to vote today I would vote against impeachment,''
said Rep. Christopher Shays, (R-Conn.), who has set a meeting with
constituents for Tuesday night. He added, ``I don't have the same
level of conviction I had a week ago. In a second ominous
development for the White House, Rep. Frank LoBiondo, (R-N.J.)
issued a written statement saying he would support impeachment.
(Sherman, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

Senate.'' (Deans, Cox News Service 300).

between now and Thursday to sway the impeachment debate in his
favor. Political consultants offer their advice. (Shepard, Cox News
Service).IMPEACH-LOBBY _ WASHINGTON _ Impeachment is said to be a
vote of conscience, but that hasn't halted efforts to pressure the
undecided House members. A pro-Clinton rally organized by Jesse
Jackson is planned for Thursday. Each side is accusing the other of
hardball tactics. (Malone, Cox News Service).

   IMPEACH-LOGIC _ WASHINGTON _ Logic suggests that if House
members believe President Clinton committed impeachable offenses,
they should vote to impeach him. But several undecided Republicans
say otherwise. They say that if Clinton confesses to conduct they
consider impeachable, they will vote against impeachment, but if he
continues to insist he is not guilty, they will vote for
impeachment. Seeking members, spokesmen or experts to explain this
seeming paradox. (Dart, Cox News Service).

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dressed in a clown costume of fiery red, orange and
yellow, Dr. Patch Adams reflected one recent afternoon on the movie
that is about to make him famous and on other topics, including the
most terrible disease in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie has changed my life,'' Adams said, not altogether
cheerfully, as he hoisted his 6-foot 4-inch frame out of a chair to
answer yet another telephone call.
</P>
<P>
   The movie ``Patch Adams,'' which is directed by Tom Shadyac and
opens nationally next week, stars Robin Williams as a doctor who
sees medicine itself as critically ill from an emotional void
between doctors and patients, the disappearance of the
old-fashioned house call and the near-industrialization of the
healing arts.
</P>
<P>
   Like the doctor in the movie, the real-life, 53-year-old
physician has spent his adult life thumbing his nose (often
Pinocchio-long or red and bulbous in clown's makeup) at the medical
establishment and at what he sees as its cancerous hunger for
profits.
</P>
<P>
   But why play the clown, both as man and doctor, as he has for
years?
</P>
<P>
   ``Humor is an antidote to all ills,'' he likes to say. He does
not disdain X-ray and CAT scan, stethoscope and scalpel. He just
believes in the restorative powers of compassion, love and
laughter, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And what is the great sickness afflicting medicine and the
world? ``Greed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Adams's faults, a lust for money does not seem to be
among them, if a visit to his book-crammed and decidedly modest
town house in suburban Arlington, Va., is any indicator.
</P>
<P>
   He has vowed that whatever money he gets as a result of the
movie (he received an unremarkable fee from the movie makers, but
acknowledged that he now commands speaking fees in the thousands)
will go toward construction of a hospital on a 310-acre tract in
West Virginia, where patients will be treated, free, not just with
medication but with humor and love.
</P>
<P>
   The West Virginia land is owned by the Gesundheit Institute,
which he founded nearly 28 years ago to promote changes in society
as well as changes in medicine. Supported by small donations and
volunteer work, the institute, which at first operated out of
doctors' homes, treated desperately ill people who were drawn to it
by word of mouth, the doctor said. They got drugs and medication,
if they wanted them, but larger doses of friendship and compassion,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I entered medicine to use it as a vehicle for social change,''
he said, allowing that he misses the turbulent 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   At its height, the institute had a score of medical workers,
including Adams and two other doctors. Although he is weak on
specifics, Adams said thousands of people, including many children,
were treated.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1983 he was featured in The Washington Post Sunday
magazine, and suddenly the institute was overwhelmed with queries.
The staff was eventually unable to handle the load, Adams said, so
it stopped seeing patients, and he threw himself into fund-raising
and promotion in order to finance construction of a hospital and
other buildings in West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   But he has been able to raise only a fraction of the money
needed, and at this point the site contains only a barnlike
building erected by volunteers. Adams said his ``treatment'' of
patients in recent years has mainly consisted of emotional support,
letter-writing and entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said he hoped the movie would generate enough interest,
and thus speaking fees and donations, to reopen and expand the
institute. Hollywood came calling not long after producers got wind
of his book, ``Gesundheit!'' (co-written by Maureen Mylander and
published by Healing Arts Press in 1993), and heard a 1993
interview on National Public Radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting ready to live the nightmare of my life,'' Adams
said, fearful that publicity about the movie will distort his
views. He added, though, that the film remained true to his beliefs
while taking some license as biography.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Patch Adams has not just taken a road less traveled. He has
blazed paths that most people would not dream of.
</P>
<P>
   Tracking his journey from Army brat to middle-aged iconoclast
can be difficult, as his eclectic mind wanders from mundane
biographical facts down serpentine detours, stopping now and then
to quote poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Washington, Hunter D. Adams grew up in Germany, Japan,
Texas and the other places his soldier father was stationed. By
high school in Arlington, his father had died and Patch (he does
not know why he got the nickname) had earned a reputation as ``a
math and science nerd'' who got top grades with little effort.
</P>
<P>
   Those years were very difficult for him. Twice in his senior
year he was hospitalized for ulcers. Then he was devastated by the
suicide of a beloved uncle. He himself flirted with suicide,
overdosing on aspirin and standing at the edge of a cliff. His
mother signed him into a mental hospital.
</P>
<P>
   After he got out, he said, he began telephoning strangers at
random, just to make human contact. He said he still does it.
</P>
<P>
   He attended George Washington University and after his junior
year was admitted to the Medical College of Virginia. There, he
said, he was infuriated by teachers who told fledgling doctors to
keep an emotional divide between themselves and patients. They, in
turn, were infuriated when he questioned their pronouncements and
dressed as a clown to make patients laugh.
</P>
<P>
   After graduation, he worked part-time as an emergency room
doctor but had already begun to bid farewell to mainstream medicine
and mainstream life. In 1971, he founded the Gesundheit Institute,
so-named because ``gesundheit'' is a wish for good health.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, he has donned paint and pantaloons while
visiting sick adults and children. Each year, he and institute
colleagues go to Russia to entertain orphaned and hospitalized
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to clown where suffering is great,'' he said, though he
admitted that he cannot laugh away all his personal sadness. He and
his wife, Linda, with whom he had two sons, are estranged.
</P>
<P>
   He realizes that his approach to life and medicine is not for
everyone. ``We are not the answer,'' he said. ``We are a stimulant
to ask questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Wade, a senior vice president of the American Hospital
Association, said some of Adams' principles have been embraced in
recent years as doctors have been encouraged to be more open with
patients and hospitals have been designed to make them more
cheerful. ``The world needs more Patch Adamses,'' Wade said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his ideas about life are just plain bizarre, though.
``Wearing underwear on the outside of your clothes can turn a
tedious trip to the store for a forgotten carton of milk into an
amusement park romp,'' Adams wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Adams acknowledged that he is most at home on the fringe. ``I'm
not a blend-in kind of guy,'' he said. Some of his dreams _ free
medical care, and medical care built on total trust and without
malpractice lawsuits _ seem remote. And if his hospital is to
become a reality, it will need people with the cool-eyed business
talents that he disdains.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Adams said that he gladly pays the price for being what
he is, and he bristled at the notion that he might be on the outer
limits of eccentricity. ``Everyone who goes to a job he doesn't
like is a lot weirder than I am,'' he said.

TO RESIGN OR NOT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers   WASHINGTON - Republican congressional
leaders demanding that President Clinton resign to spare the
country further exposure to the ugly impeachment process are not
thinking clearly. Actually, they are not thinking ahead at all.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Do they really prefer to run against incumbent President Al Gore
in two years instead of a vice president campaigning in the shadow
of that lying lecher who occupies the White House?
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton resigns, Gore will have the opportunity to stamp his
own identity firmly on the country before the election and draw a
contrast between his own stuffy image and that of scandal-scarred
Bill Clinton. As a sitting president, Gore is likely to escape a
Democratic primary challenge and dominate his party's political
direction in a way he cannot now do as the sidekick of a crippled
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time months earlier in this sorry saga when it was
appropriate for Clinton to resign, before we began drowning in the
sordid details of Oval Office hanky-panky. This columnist was for
it. He might have been saved some shame. It might have helped to
preserve the dignity and power of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But now it is too late. We already know more about this disaster
than we ever cared or needed to know. The damage to his reputation
is done. The damage to the institution of the presidency is already
incalculable.
</P>
<P>
   With the House Judiciary Committee's party-line vote to
recommend impeachment, it became imperative to let the political
process play out to its conclusion. The committee made no serious
attempt to go about its legal duty in a judicious way. After
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr irresponsibly argued for
impeachment by interpreting every contradiction and ambiguity in
behavior and recollection in the case against Clinton, the
committee's GOP members gave him a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   This is pure politics, and it isn't over.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows whether the House will vote by simple majority to
send impeachment charges to the Senate for trial. The Republicans
have the majority. If it is another straight, mindless party-line
vote, they will prevail. That would confirm the extreme
polarization of Washington politics but give us little confidence
that the legislative branch has considered the historic importance
of its decision.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has the support of two thirds of the public and he has
been, in his public duties, a good and sound president. This is a
two-party system, and he is correct not to give up and crawl away
solely on Republican say-so.
</P>
<P>
   The real test of our democratic process is yet to come in the
Senate. To convict him there, a bipartisan two-thirds vote will be
required. The Republicans cannot bring him down by themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The president will be able to call and cross-examine witnesses
in his own defense. Months, not just days or hours, will be spent
debating the problem. Minds may actually be changed. An alternative
penalty like censure, forbidden by GOP leaders in the House, may
finally be considered.
</P>
<P>
   And there, in the Senate, the conclusion is likely to be that
while he has undoubtedly sinned, he has not committed the high
crimes for which being booted out of office is the appropriate
remedy. He will remain in office.
</P>
<P>
   Sane legislators would like to avoid this protracted scenario.
But the way out is to impose some penalty short of removal,
involuntarily or not.
</P>
<P>
   If the Republicans manage to hound Clinton out of town
prematurely, voters may well be so upset that they will seek
revenge in the next election, returning both houses of Congress to
Democratic control and electing Gore president in his own right.
Voters have been trying to tell the deaf GOP through polls and last
November's election that they do not want Clinton impeached.
</P>
<P>
   But a backlash is a risk the GOP is foolish enough to take. Some
partisans are blithely contending the public memory is so short
that few voters will remember all this two years from now. No way.
This sex stuff is all too memorable, as it applies to both the
perpetrator and his persecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Do the Republicans forget the outrage against the party's
inflammatory advertising campaign attempting to turn the November
election into a mandate to impeach Clinton? It reduced the GOP
numbers in the House and drove Speaker Newt Gingrich from power. In
their dream of sticking the Democrats with scandal, the Republicans
impaled themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is disgraced. He has repeatedly confessed to wrongdoing.
His own party is demanding a censure that would include painful
financial penalties. Nobody defends what he did. The demands that
he confess to specific criminality are unrealistic. If he did so,
he would be subject to indictment as soon as he is out of office.
</P>
<P>
   In a rational world, censure would do it. He will be gone from
Washington soon enough anyway, and the power of his office has been
diminished.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leadership's cry for Clinton's head is driven by
emotion, not logic. Far better for the party to have a brow-beaten
Clinton in the White House to scorn than a lively Gore to contend
with.
</P>
<P>
   Gore in the White House could also give Clinton the ultimate
protection that Presidents Gerald Ford and George Bush provided GOP
officials in danger of going to jail. Ford pardoned President
Nixon, the unindicted Watergate co-conspirator, and Bush pardoned
Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, indicted for lying to
Congress under oath.
</P>
<P>
   If the Republicans really want to see Clinton behind bars, they
shouldn't be eager to make it easier for Gore to defeat Texas Gov.
George W. Bush or whoever wins the GOP presidential nomination. But
that would require a unified party strategy, which they do not
have.

 &HT;    Players not surprised 'tough guy' Reeves didn't let on he was in
pain
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The players who go way back with him, to New York or even
Denver, aren't surprised that their coach never disclosed by word
or involuntary gesture his own physical condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talk about Iron Mike (Ditka), but Dan's a tough, tough
guy,'' offensive lineman Dave Widell, a former Bronco, said Monday.
Widell knew that Falcons coach Dan Reeves was at that moment
undergoing coronary bypass surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves endured five knee operations by his mid-20s but refused
to give up the game he loved and played at South Carolina and with
the Dallas Cowboys. He underwent two angioplasty procedures to
remove arterial blockages, one in 1990 and another in '91, when he
coached in Denver, hardly missing a beat.
</P>
<P>
   Suffering a familiar burning sensation in his chest and throat
in recent weeks, Reeves must have suspected that he was in trouble,
but his players were not aware of anything until Monday when they
heard the news on the radio or when they arrived at Suwanee for
team meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known him for six years,'' said former Falcons tight end
Bob Kozlowski, a former Giant. ``He never gave us an indication
that he wasn't feeling well. He's a strong, strong guy. He'll fight
through this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, the news really surprised me,'' Kozlowski said. ``I'm
sure none of us saw this coming.''
</P>
<P>
   And Widell said that's how Reeves wanted it. ``He knew how
important this stretch of games was to our team, and he didn't want
anything to affect the way we played. That's how he is.''
</P>
<P>
   And tough as Reeves is, offensive lineman Robert Tobeck said,
``He'll be back on the sidelines before the season's over. I really
expect that.''
</P>
<P>
   For running back Jamal Anderson, the day meant a double blow.
Temporarily, he lost the architect of the offense that has enabled
him to rank second in the NFL in rushing with 1,596 yards. Anderson
said he knows that Reeves will return, but the same can't be said
for fullback Bob Christian, his principal blocker who went on
injured reserve with damage to the medial collateral and anterior
cruciate ligaments of his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``After today, I may have to go see a priest or something,''
Anderson said. ``It's just unbelievable coming off a big game, and
everybody is feeling good, and Dan goes down like that.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the Falcons on the verge of clinching their divisional
championship, there's no time for a misstep, Anderson said. ``I
don't really know how you deal with it, but you have to go on. You
can't let it stop you.''
</P>
<P>
   For cornerback Ray Buchanan, Reeves' surgery was staggering. ``I
just found out,'' Buchanan said shortly before 1 p.m. ``We were
excited and joyous. We came out (of New Orleans) with a victory
with no clue that this was happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's his nature that he didn't say anything,'' Buchanan noted.
``He betrayed no signs of illness. Now, it's up to us to get the
job done until he gets back.''

INVESTIGATORS QUESTION MARINES' ACTIONS IN BORDER SHOOTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDFORD, Texas _ A senior FBI agent and a Texas Ranger want a
grand jury to take a new look into the controversial shooting death
of a young man by the Marine leading an anti-drug patrol.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Texas Ranger who helped investigate the 1997
killing accused the military of obstructing the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government came in and stifled the
investigation,'' Texas Rangers Sgt. David Duncan said. ``It's
really depressing. The system we hoped would work failed at the
federal level.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan argued that subpoenas were ignored, documents were hidden
and the Marines at times were kept from him and other
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Esequiel Hernandez Jr., 18, was killed May 20, 1997, as he
herded his family's goats in this village of unpaved streets along
the Rio Grande west of the Big Bend National Park.
</P>
<P>
   Cpl. Clemente Banuelos shot Hernandez once in the chest with his
M-16 after Hernandez fired twice through the brush and allegedly
raised his .22-caliber rifle as if to fire a third time at
Banuelos's heavily camouflaged four-man patrol.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Marines perceived a target-practicing shot as a threat to
their safety,'' said Terry Kincaid, a supervisory senior agent at
the FBI's office in Midland, Texas. He was referring to speculation
that Hernandez was shooting at objects such as tin cans.
</P>
<P>
   ``From that point, their training and instincts took over to
neutralize a threat,'' said Kincaid, who called for a new grand
jury look at the case.
</P>
<P>
   Two state grand juries did not find sufficient evidence to
indict the Marine. And a separate federal grand jury also returned
no indictments after considering whether the Marine patrol violated
Hernandez's civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the Navy Department, which oversees the Marine Corps,
agreed without admitting wrongdoing to pay $1.9 million to the
Hernandez family to settle a wrongful death claim against the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Kincaid said the incident could have been avoided if Banuelos
and his team had been better supervised and had not overreacted
after believing they had come under fire.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Rangers became involved in the case because they
traditionally investigate major crimes in rural counties. The FBI
investigated because the Marines were involved in the shooting. The
Marines were working a surveillance patrol under U.S. Border Patrol
supervision at the time of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen suspended military involvement
in anti-drug patrols along the border soon after Hernandez was
killed.
</P>
<P>
   Marine Maj. Gen. John Admire said the Marines responded
appropriately when they came under fire and that Hernandez's own
actions led to his death.
</P>
<P>
   The stance by the Rangers and the FBI came as a dispute over the
shooting was reignited by the partial release of a 13,000-page
Marine Corps report that found fault with the Marines' behavior and
training but concluded the shooting wasn't a crime.
</P>
<P>
   A separate, 12,000-page report by the Justice Department on
Hernandez's death includes documents that show federal prosecutors
also had questions about the Marines' version of the shooting.
Thousands of pages of that report have not been made public.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department report notes federal prosecutors once
considered perjury charges against at least two of the Marines,
alleging they lied to FBI agents, but the prosecutors decided they
lacked evidence to file charges.
</P>
<P>
   Since grand jury proceedings are secret, it is not known how
much of the information gathered by the Justice Department and the
military has been kept from state investigators, but Duncan said
neither the military nor federal prosecutors have cooperated with
his probe.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. John Coyne, who headed the Pentagon's investigation,
said he had ``lingering suspicions'' about the shooting, but no
evidence proved a crime was committed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report was as thorough and exhaustive as I could have made
it,'' said Coyne, who is retired and lives in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   He attributed the shooting to inadequate training and failures
in the chain of command.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basic Marine Corps training instills an aggressive spirit
while teaching combat skills,'' Coyne wrote in his report. ``More
is needed to place young fully armed Marines in a domestic
environment and perform noncombat duties.''
</P>
<P>
   Presidio County District Attorney Albert Valadez said he would
need new evidence to take the case to another state grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sought two indictments for murder. That speaks for itself.
(The Marines) pursued (Hernandez) and they killed him,'' Valadez
said. ``If Dave (Duncan) or any of the Rangers finds evidence that
warrants another grand jury, we'll go round three.''
</P>
<P>
   Banuelos, a San Francisco native who left the military with an
honorable discharge, has said he shot Hernandez to prevent a member
of the patrol from being killed.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Zimmermann, a Houston lawyer and former Marine colonel
representing Banuelos, repeatedly has said that while the shooting
was unfortunate, it wasn't a crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point we need to let Clemente Banuelos know what he
did was what he was supposed to do and let it go,'' Zimmermann said
earlier. ``Corporal Banuelos' actions were entirely justified under
the law and consistent with what he was trained to do.''

THE VIEW FROM THE GUNBARREL: A WINTER WONDERLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM STIENSTRA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH LAKE TAHOE, Nev. _ From the brink of the Gunbarrel, you
can scan down the powder-white mountain slopes and beyond across
cobalt-blue Lake Tahoe, and enjoy one of the prettiest winter
scenes available anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Though the winter solstice is still a few days away, the view is
now a testimonial that winter has arrived in force at Tahoe and the
rest of the mountain West, and that the upcoming ski and snowboard
season is set for a stellar year.
</P>
<P>
   Gunbarrel is often the best ski run where to make this
assessment. It is routed on the lower face of Heavenly at South
Tahoe, the West's biggest and most beautiful ski area. From the top
of Gunbarrel, you get a view of nearly the entire Tahoe Basin, and
it answers the fantasy of many skiers and snowboaders who dream of
cutting an edge through fresh powder while being continually
exhilarated by a panorama of California's most beautiful lake.
</P>
<P>
   From the parking lot, anybody can take the Gunbarrel Express
($14 per person) to a cafe with an outside deck with a view set at
8,250 feet. From here, skiers and boarders can jump on the
Stagecoach Express, which will lift you to the top of Heavenly at
10,100 feet. It can be very cold up here, and of course, you dress
for it, but it is the views that provide the lasting chills.
</P>
<P>
   I used to think you had to climb mountains to get views like
this; at Lake Tahoe, for instance, it was climbing Mount Tallac, a
challenging all-day thump-and-grunt to the summit at 9,735 feet.
But in the winter, you get a similar view in relative minutes by
taking the high-speed quads, then skiing down. It seems effortless
and euphoric, and to absorb it all is breathtaking, the expanse of
Tahoe contrasted against the surrounding white mountains.
</P>
<P>
   It is not only the picture of an excellent start to the ski
season at Heavenly and the rest of Tahoe, but also across Northern
California and Nevada. The inside word in the ski industry is that
the combination of a warm December in the northeast yet early snows
in the West has a number of easterners canceling ski holidays in
New England and rebooking for Tahoe and Sun Valley in Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   The last two ski areas always open early for winter, Ski
Homewood, set on the west shore of Tahoe, and Badger Pass on
Glacier Point Road in Yosemite, opened too on Friday, making it a
perfect 20-of-20 ski areas in Northern California and Nevada that
are up and running.
</P>
<P>
   Heavenly is always the centerpiece, and with 42 to 60 inches of
snow (depending on elevation), 22-of-26 lifts are open here,
providing access to 74 runs. This has become one the priciest lift
tickets around, $52 a day, and you can add in a ton of extras, like
mid-level mountain cafes and dining (where a small cup of wine and
a beer costs $10). But people are lining up, with the conditions,
views and experience among the best anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Kirkwood on Highway 88 out of South Tahoe was reporting the most
snow of any area, 93 inches on top, nearly eight feet, a huge
amount for so early in the season. Of course, the unofficial
contest among ski areas to report the most snow is always subject
to verification. What is more important are the number of lifts
operating (which is easily documented) and the surface conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Tips: Always have lodging reservations before heading out. If
there are any questions over prices, conditions, access and lift
lines, call the ski area first.

 &HT;    POLITICAL EXPERTS SAY CONFESSION CLINTON'S ONLY CHANCE
 &HT;    470 words
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With support of moderate Republicans threatening to
erode, President Clinton's only chance of avoiding impeachment by
the House of Representatives on Thursday may be a public confession
of guilt, some political experts said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to do that,'' said Dick Morris, the campaign
consultant to whom Clinton has often turned in times of trouble
throughout his political career.
</P>
<P>
   After the president returns Tuesday night from the Middle East,
he should meet as soon as possible with the handful of moderate
Republicans who have signaled their possible opposition to
impeachment, Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   After that, ``he should go out in public in the Rose Garden, and
they should cut a deal for a big fine and censure and an apology
and, most importantly of all, a confession,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   It was a mistake for Clinton to go to the Middle East as the
House Judiciary Committee was approving four articles of
impeachment, Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should be here now,'' meeting with the dwindling number of
Republicans who could save his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Morris' advice echoed that of Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn.,
who acknowledged Monday that he does not have ``the same level of
conviction'' he had a week ago for opposing impeachment when it
comes to a vote in the House on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Shays said Clinton needs to declare ``that he did not tell the
truth'' before the grand jury that investigated his affair with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky and to express a
willingness to ``face the court like any other American citizen''
after leaving office.
</P>
<P>
   Morris said the president is wrong to be so concerned about
possible criminal prosecution after leaving office.
</P>
<P>
   ``His confession is not going to make any difference after he
leaves office,'' he said. ``They'll either prosecute a former
president, or they won't. He'll either be pardoned, or he won't.
This confession won't matter. But it will matter right now to the
20 or so moderate Republican congressmen.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Pitney, a former Republican strategist who now teaches
political science in California, said he would advise the president
to ``go to church,'' confess that he had ``broken God's law'' and
declare his offense ``far more serious than anything that members
of Congress are debating right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Such an event would catch the public's attention but would not
contain a specific admission of perjury, Pitney said.
</P>
<P>
   And it would allow Clinton defenders to pose rhetorical
questions such as: ``Which is more important _ a technical
violation of a federal statute or a violation of God's
commandment?'' and ``Now that he's confessed to violating God's
law, why not leave the punishment up to God?''
</P>
<P>
   ``This approach, of course, would be cynical and manipulative,''
Pitney said. ``That's why I think Clinton might take it.''

 &HT;    On the flip side, kids can find affordable presents for parents
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   While it may seem to most kids that Mom and Dad have everything
they could possibly want, believe it or not, they still expect
something for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the stuff you hear parents talking about like golf
clubs and designer clothes is totally out of your price range, and
even if somebody handed you a million dollars, you wouldn't know
where to buy it, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   America Online's Giftfinder helps you find the right gifts by
asking questions about the person you're shopping for. If Mom is a
super-organized bookworm and Dad is a home-improvement-gadget
freak, the Giftfinder will suggest things they might like. From
here, you can surf to other sites for more choice and selection.
</P>
<P>
   But a word of warning before you head off into the world of
online shopping: If you order something online, you need a credit
card to pay for it. If you don't have any plastic, use the Web as a
research tool to check out possible gift ideas and then head to the
nearest retailer to pick the gift up in person and pay with cash or
a check.
</P>
<P>
   Even though most kids are on limited budgets, they can use the
Web to locate a variety of gifts their folks will love for less
than $100.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps while you're reading this, your parents are buying you
some CDs or videos for the holidays. You can return the favor and
get them books or videos on their favorite subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Check out Amazon.com (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .amazon.com) for book and movie suggestions. If you know Dad
loves biographies or Mom loves murder mysteries, here's a great
place to look over new titles, get suggestions and read reviews
from people who have already read the book.
</P>
<P>
   You might also want to check out Amazon.com's custom gift
matcher, which will help you choose gifts based on personal likes
and dislikes. A test drive of the Amazon gift matcher turned up
both books and videos that seemed appropriate for the parents in
question. If your folks have a long commute to work _ it's a good
bet they do _ you might want to try a selection from Audiobooks
(http://www
</P>
<P>
   .audiobooks.com).
</P>
<P>
   Several online sites have compiled their own list of ``can't
miss'' gifts, including REI's Web site (http://www.rei.com), which
is full of great ideas for outdoorsy types of all ages. For golf
lovers, you can check out golf balls at Golfballs.com
(http://www.golfballs.com). For the gourmet cook, there's Digital
Chef (http://www.digitalchef.com), which boasts the largest
selection of utensils and food products on the Web. And if you want
to surprise your family and cook a holiday dish yourself, try the
Web site for the TV Food Network (http://www.foodtv.com).

 &HT;    Reeves, Brooks relationship helped turned Falcons around
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   He strode to the podium with ambivalence. Rich Brooks is a
coach, and the good, ambitious ones want the responsibility of the
head job. But his boss and friend, Dan Reeves, was in the hospital
Monday, making Brooks' walk to a bouquet of microphones difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks did not want to return as a head coach this way. But
that's what he'll be for the Atlanta Falcons until Reeves recovers
from bypass surgery. It could be two weeks or three weeks or four
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us are extremely concerned with Dan's condition,''
Brooks said. ``That being said, we have to go on with the job. We
have to treat Dan's absence as a player out with an injury who you
expect back in a couple of weeks. Everybody else has to pick up the
slack around him and do a better job to make up for his absence.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves made Brooks his assistant head coach and defensive
coordinator after Brooks was fired by the St. Louis Rams after the
1996 season. The two have formed a working relationship that has
helped the Falcons ascend from the doldrums to the top of the NFC
West. More than that, they have become friends.
</P>
<P>
   It was Reeves who threw Brooks a lifeline after the 1996 season.
And it came at a time when Brooks was trying to get over a firing
that was hard to take. He was given only two years with the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I thought we were going in the right direction,'' Brooks
said. ``I was disappointed that I wasn't able to see it through. I
would have liked more time.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves knew of Brooks from his Giants defensive coordinator Mike
Nolan, who played under Brooks at Oregon. Reeves called Brooks for
advice about the vacant St. Louis job. Brooks told Reeves he'd be
interested in working for him with any team other than the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   So when the Falcons hired Reeves, he recalled the complimentary
words Nolan said about Brooks, the way the Rams played under him
and Brooks' interest in working under Reeves. Reeves called. St.
Louis' loss was Atlanta's gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of respect for Rich,'' Reeves said in October.
``He's very honest and clearly can work with anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, it was something St. Louis couldn't see. When Brooks
was hired from Oregon, the Rams' hierarchy sought a quick fix
instead of building a solid, young team through the draft and wise
free-agent signings. Brooks was fired before he could put his own
stamp on the team.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, the Falcons have prospered on defense, improving in
every category since 1996 under Brooks. The Falcons' defense is
ranked seventh overall, second against the run and second in
takeaways.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks has relied on an aggressive system that allows players to
attack and exploit opponents' weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   The transition from head coach to assistant went about as
smoothly as could be expected for someone who had been in the top
spot for 20 years. ``I don't know if I'd say it was smooth,''
Brooks said. The Falcons would disagree.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks said there's a certain amount of pressure and
responsibility that comes with replacing Reeves, who demands
professionalism and effort at all times. He also hopes his
head-coaching experience is beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   ``(But) I don't know how important that is,'' he said. ``I feel
fortunate that Dan gave me an opportunity to come in and be a part
of what we're doing here. I just hope that I can fill a role.''
</P>
<P>
   Filling that role means producing victories in the last two
games against Detroit and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to finish this thing correctly,'' Brooks said. ``We
want to go on the road in a tough place to play against a very good
team and win at Detroit. Then (we want to come) home against Miami
and (finish) that off with a win. And then we can go into the
playoffs, hopefully with a first-round bye.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope . . . to continue what he's done here,'' Brooks
said. ``That's what would make Dan feel better.''

   Panthers' Greene suspended, fined $117,647
</P>
<P>
   By Len Pasquarelli
</P>
<P>
   C. 1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   His hands were around the neck of assistant coach Kevin Steele,
but Carolina Panthers linebacker Kevin Greene insisted Monday that
his Sunday stranglehold should not be compared to the actions of
NBA forward Latrell Sprewell last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way,'' said Greene, who was suspended for one game by coach
Dom Capers, a penalty that will cost the 14-year veteran $117,647.
``This was strictly a heat-of-the-moment kind of thing. That guy
came back two times on his coach.''
</P>
<P>
   The embarrassing sideline scuffle early in the second quarter is
the latest indiscretion for a Panthers team that has suffered
through a tough season on and off the field. Greene apparently
missed a defensive call and remained on the periphery instead of
blitzing inside.
</P>
<P>
   Steele, the team's linebackers coach, was complaining to the
entire defense and Greene felt the criticism was directly only at
him. ``Get out my face,'' he screamed at Steele as he rose off the
bench to confront the coach.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Eric Davis and outside linebackers coach Billy Davis
separated the two but not before the action was captured by still
and television cameras.

 &HT;    On the flip side, kids can find affordable presents for parents
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   While it may seem to most kids that Mom and Dad have everything
they could possibly want, believe it or not, they still expect
something for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the stuff you hear parents talking about like golf
clubs and designer clothes is totally out of your price range, and
even if somebody handed you a million dollars, you wouldn't know
where to buy it, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   America Online's Giftfinder helps you find the right gifts by
asking questions about the person you're shopping for. If Mom is a
super-organized bookworm and Dad is a home-improvement-gadget
freak, the Giftfinder will suggest things they might like. From
here, you can surf to other sites for more choice and selection.
</P>
<P>
   But a word of warning before you head off into the world of
online shopping: If you order something online, you need a credit
card to pay for it. If you don't have any plastic, use the Web as a
research tool to check out possible gift ideas and then head to the
nearest retailer to pick the gift up in person and pay with cash or
a check.
</P>
<P>
   Even though most kids are on limited budgets, they can use the
Web to locate a variety of gifts their folks will love for less
than $100.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps while you're reading this, your parents are buying you
some CDs or videos for the holidays. You can return the favor and
get them books or videos on their favorite subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Check out Amazon.com (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .amazon.com) for book and movie suggestions. If you know Dad
loves biographies or Mom loves murder mysteries, here's a great
place to look over new titles, get suggestions and read reviews
from people who have already read the book.
</P>
<P>
   You might also want to check out Amazon.com's custom gift
matcher, which will help you choose gifts based on personal likes
and dislikes. A test drive of the Amazon gift matcher turned up
both books and videos that seemed appropriate for the parents in
question. If your folks have a long commute to work _ it's a good
bet they do _ you might want to try a selection from Audiobooks
(http://www
</P>
<P>
   .audiobooks.com).
</P>
<P>
   Several online sites have compiled their own list of ``can't
miss'' gifts, including REI's Web site (http://www.rei.com), which
is full of great ideas for outdoorsy types of all ages. For golf
lovers, you can check out golf balls at Golfballs.com
(http://www.golfballs.com). For the gourmet cook, there's Digital
Chef (http://www.digitalchef.com), which boasts the largest
selection of utensils and food products on the Web. And if you want
to surprise your family and cook a holiday dish yourself, try the
Web site for the TV Food Network (http://www.foodtv.com).

   Panthers' Greene suspended, fined $117,647
</P>
<P>
   By Len Pasquarelli
</P>
<P>
   C. 1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   His hands were around the neck of assistant coach Kevin Steele,
but Carolina Panthers linebacker Kevin Greene insisted Monday that
his Sunday stranglehold should not be compared to the actions of
NBA forward Latrell Sprewell last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way,'' said Greene, who was suspended for one game by coach
Dom Capers, a penalty that will cost the 14-year veteran $117,647.
``This was strictly a heat-of-the-moment kind of thing. That guy
came back two times on his coach.''
</P>
<P>
   The embarrassing sideline scuffle early in the second quarter is
the latest indiscretion for a Panthers team that has suffered
through a tough season on and off the field. Greene apparently
missed a defensive call and remained on the periphery instead of
blitzing inside.
</P>
<P>
   Steele, the team's linebackers coach, was complaining to the
entire defense and Greene felt the criticism was directed only at
him. ``Get out my face,'' he screamed at Steele as he rose off the
bench to confront the coach.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Eric Davis and outside linebackers coach Billy Davis
separated the two but not before the action was captured by still
and television cameras.

`ALMOST' ISN'T ENOUGH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``It's All Been Done,'' sang Canada's high-octane
Barenaked Ladies, perhaps summing up today's rock scene in the
title of one of their hits Friday during the opening night of
KROQ's pair of ninth annual ``Almost Acoustic Christmas'' shows at
the Shrine Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   The 6,000-plus young fans at the popular eight-act event also
responded loudly to radio hits from Blink 182, Offspring, Reel Big
Fish and Sugar Ray, while paying attention to Hole, the Cardigans
and Korn.
</P>
<P>
   The two-day Christmas show, which this year relocated from the
Universal Amphitheatre to the Shrine, always sells out in an
instant, but much of Friday's lineup suffered from monotony.
One-dimensional acts like Korn, Sugar Ray, Blink 182 and Reel Big
Fish offered energetic but ultimately empty sets.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, Courtney Love was the night's wild card and musical
highlight, appearing at first unsteady but later showing that first
impression was the result of a calculated pose. Fronting her band
Hole, Love sang ragged but right versions of ``Malibu,''
``Celebrity Skin'' and other pop-rock gems from her new album.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the charismatic guitarist and singer introduced a
friend named Eduardo whom she said she'd ``picked up'' on Hollywood
Boulevard. The fellow, who turned out to be Love's beau, actor
Edward Norton, strummed an acoustic guitar in the background for a
song before giving Love a quick kiss and sprinting off stage.
</P>
<P>
   The evening's other memorable moments came courtesy of
Offspring, who kept the goofing around to a minimum, aside from an
opening gambit that involved two pairs of little people dressed in
s&AMP;m gear for a dance routine to cover versions of Soft Cell's ``Sex
Dwarf'' and Devo's ``Whip It.'' Afterward, the Orange County
quartet churned out a lively set of well-arranged, melodic pop-punk
tunes such as the current hit, ``Pretty Fly (For a White Guy).''
</P>
<P>
   Barenaked Ladies, Reel Big Fish and Blink 182 drew a strong
response from the youngest members of the audience, who welcomed
the groups' jungle-gym stage antics and vapid ditties like Blink's
radio hit, ``Dammit (Growing Up).''
</P>
<P>
   Playing early in the evening, Sweden's Cardigans miscalculated
by concentrating on several slow, droney dirges that kept new
arrivals firmly in their seats or in the lobby's long beverage
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Those who didn't leave the downtown auditorium to race to the
Roxy, where Hole was playing a just-announced after-midnight set,
heard Korn's approximation of Mettalica, minus the material. The
frowning Bakersfield thrash quintet, which enjoyed a huge
commercial breakthrough this year, does one thing over and over, a
hard-on-the-ears single-chord stop-and-start effect that has indeed
all been done many times before.

   IMPEACH (Washington) _ As the impeachment vote neared in the
House, several of President Clinton's few Republican supporters
began to waver Monday. Instead of conciliation, the White House
turned to the attack with Vice President Gore denouncing
Congressional Republicans for refusing to allow a vote on censure
and asserting they were thwarting the overwhelming will of the
nation. With photo. By Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-ASSESS (Washington) _ Since his days as an
undergraduate, Bill Clinton has believed, his oldest friends say,
that he could talk his way out of any predicament. From then until
now, he has usually been right. Suddenly, whether last week in
Washington or this week in the Middle East, Clinton has turned
pensive, wan and remote. BY R.W. Apple Jr.
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-CLINTON (Gaza City, Gaza) _ With President Clinton as
their witness, hundreds of former Palestinian terrorists voted here
Monday to rid their organization's charter of any clauses calling
for the destruction of Israel, knocking down a critical roadblock
on the rutted path to peace. By Deborah Sontag. With map.
</P>
<P>
   TOBACCO-LAWYER (Undated) _ How one tobacco lawyer, fearing that
his fees would be slashed because of an overall cap on payments,
pumped up his bill from $50 million in hopes of getting a bigger
piece of the pie. By Barry Meier.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-DEPORTATIONS (New York) _ In the two years since Congress
passed tough anti-immigration laws to stem the flow of illegal
immigration to the United States, federal authorities have deported
almost 300,000 immigrants to countries all over the world, more
than twice the number of people who were sent back in the two years
before. The unprecedented high number of deportations have been
possible because for the first time the INS has both the
congressional mandate and the financial resources to investigate
and prosecute violators of immigration law, arrest immigrants with
criminal convictions as well as would-be immigrants at the border
and swiftly deport them from the United States _ sometimes in less
than 12 hours. By Mirta Ojito.
</P>
<P>
   NY-VACCO-CONCEDE (Albany, N.Y.) _ State Attorney General Dennis
Vacco on Monday conceded he had lost the disputed Nov. 3 election
to Eliot Spitzer, as a judge tossed the Republican incumbent's
lawsuit out of court.
</P>
<P>
   MATTEL-LEARNING (Undated) _ Mattel Inc., the world's largest toy
maker, said Monday that it had agreed to acquire the Learning Co.
in a $3.8-billion stock deal that would position the company as a
leader in the fast-growing market for educational and entertainment
software.
</P>
<P>
   TARNISHED LAUREATE (Undated) _ A Nobel laureate is accused of
untruths in an autobiography. By Larry Rohter.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-EVOLVE (Undated) _ The study of evolutionary convergence has
taken on a new twist, as researchers look beyond such flamboyant
cases of anatomical similarities to detect subtle instances of
convergence among molecules. They have found striking analogies
between the antifreeze proteins that allow two unrelated groups of
fish swimming on opposite ends of the globe to endure in icy
waters. They have detected a bizarre form of antibody protein in
species as different as camels and sharks _ antibodies that look
eerily like each other, and unlike the antibodies of most
vertebrate creatures, yet that evolved along entirely autonomous
pathways. By Natalie Angier.

 &HT;    IMPEACHMENT TRIAL WOULD HURT THE COUNTRY, CLINTON SAYS
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAZA CITY, Gaza _ Battling his Capitol Hill foes even as he
campaigns for Mideast peace, President Clinton said Monday that an
impeachment trial in the Senate would hurt the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't believe it's in the interest of the United States or
the American people to go through this impeachment process with a
trial in the Senate,'' Clinton said in response to questions
shouted at a photo opportunity with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he referred to his stated willingness to accept censure
for his relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky
and his efforts to mislead the public and court officials about
that relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have offered to make every effort to make any reasonable
compromise with the Congress,'' Clinton said. ''I'm still willing
to do that. That's all I know to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton addressed the issue publicly and directly only once in a
day devoted almost entirely to diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   But some listeners also heard a veiled reference to impeachment
in Clinton's remarks to members of the Palestinian National Council
in this tiny swath of Palestinian-controlled territory.
</P>
<P>
   In a reference to the need for reconciliation between Israelis
and Palestinians after five decades of enmity and bloodshed,
Clinton paraphrased Jesus Christ's admonition to those who would
harshly judge others.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the wisest things He ever said was, 'We will be judged
by the same standard by which we judge; but mercy triumphs over
judgment,''' said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The president was apparently referring to Matthew 7:1-2, in
which Jesus says, ``Judge not, that ye be not judged. For with what
judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye
mete, it shall be measured to you again.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides said the president spent very little time Monday dealing
with impeachment. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said at a
news conference that ``the president's not cutting short his
trip,'' due to end Tuesday evening, to return to Washington to deal
with the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, meanwhile, accused House Republicans on
Monday of ignoring public opinion in their drive for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people, by overwhelming majorities, have decided
that notwithstanding that what the president did was wrong, he
should not be impeached and removed from office,'' Gore said at an
appearance with Attorney General Janet Reno in Washington. ``What
they favor instead, is censure, to give the president the
punishment ...they feel is appropriate in this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What the leadership of the Congress has done is to prevent any
kind of compromise along the lines that the American people want to
see. And instead, they threaten to put the country through this
long ordeal that would ensue, and it's not the right thing to do,''
Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart, asked at a news briefing
here how an impeachment trial would harm the country, replied,
``Any student of the markets will say that uncertainty is bad for
the markets. I think a Senate trial lends uncertainty. As far as
the economy as a whole, it can't be a good idea to tie up the
Senate for months on end.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Gore and Lockhart said Clinton would not heed calls to
resign in order to avoid a disruptive trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that would send a pretty sorry message to the American
public, that on a partisan basis, a party, because they had the
majority, could remove the president on something that never
reaches the standards of an impeachable offense,'' Lockhart said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   New digital-imaging techniques may soon help doctors search for
early signs of melanoma, the most deadly form of skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, doctors or medical photographers have used
high-end cameras and 35-mm film to take two dozen or so photographs
of the entire bodies of those at high risk for melanoma. Each time
a patient visits, doctor and patient view the slides and compare
present moles with the photographic record. Small changes in moles
may be the first indications of malignancy.
</P>
<P>
   Though patients will still have to endure standing nude or near
nude for the full-body photographs, now a new digital method has
been developed by Dr. James M. Grichnik, an assistant professor at
Duke University Medical Center in Durham, that substitutes a
computer and a CD-ROM for a slide projector and color
transparencies.
</P>
<P>
   Grichnik digitizes the color slides he takes of his patients and
displays the images on his computer monitor by way of a CD-ROM. If
a mole appears questionable, he zooms in for a closer look.
</P>
<P>
   Though the new technology is available only at Duke, Grichnik
said, experts expect digital-imaging techniques will gradually
replace standard photography as more professionals shift to
electronic records.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sylvia Owen, a medical resident in dermatology at Duke
University Medical Center, has used both a slide projector and a
computer monitor and prefers the new system.
</P>
<P>
   ``A patient may have a dozen moles on his shoulder blade _ and
all of them look alike,'' she said. ``Instead of spending five
minutes squinting at slides to make sure I have the right mole, I
can immediately move to a monitor for a full, close-up view. This
is more than high-tech fun; baseline images like these are
lifesaving.''
</P>
<P>
   Patients pay $225 for the CD-ROM, frequently out-of-pocket, as
many policies do not cover dermatologic photography.
</P>
<P>
   Grichnik is marketing the digitizing service to convert color
slides to CD-ROMs as well as the software to display the 33 views
of the patient through a company he set up, the Malachite Corp.
</P>
<P>
   At Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan, Dr.
Allan C. Halpern, chief of dermatology, is evaluating several ways
to use digital images. ``We want images that are easily accessed
and manipulated, and that are more available for transmission from
one office to another,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Melanoma is the most lethal form of skin cancer. Although it
accounts for only 5 percent of all skin cancers, it is responsible
for more than three-quarters of all deaths from the disease. Dr.
Darrell Rigel, a professor at New York University Medical Center
and president-elect of the American Academy of Dermatology,
estimates that 7,300 Americans will die of melanoma this year.
``Prompt recognition is critical because this form of cancer
spreads rather early,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those at risk for malignant melanoma include people with a
family history of the disease, fair-skinned people with a tendency
to sunburn easily, and those spending considerable time in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Perry Robins, president of the Skin Cancer Foundation, a New
York public information group, says that in addition to seeing a
doctor for a full-body baseline examination, people should also do
regular self-examinations ``at least on their birthday and a couple
of times a year.''

 &HT;    Atlanta Olympic officials repeat denials they didn't 'buy' '96
Games
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Atlanta Olympic officials were aware that influence peddlers
lurked close to International Olympic Committee members, but they
continued to maintain Monday that the city did not ``buy'' the 1996
Games by bribing IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never talked to those people; they never approached me,''
said Billy Payne, president of the Atlanta Committee for the
Olympic Games. ``It's legend in Olympic lore that there are some
influential people. But I couldn't name any of them today. Nor did
we hire anybody. Nor did we pay any IOC members.''
</P>
<P>
   Payne's strident denial came after Marc Hodler, the Swiss
Olympic official who rocked the Olympic movement this weekend with
accusations of vote-buying, repeated his charges Monday at the
close of an Olympic meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Without offering any details, Hodler, 80, linked Atlanta to a
pattern of bribery and other ethical malpractice in the bidding and
selection of at least four Olympic host cities _ the others are
Nagano, Sydney and Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Hodler alleged that four ``agents,'' including one IOC member,
were involved in vote-buying during the past 10 years. He said it
was difficult to imagine ``Atlanta could have been facing this
blackmail'' from agents without ``doing something.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This man for 10 years was my friend,'' Payne said, referring
to Hodler. ``I was shocked and surprised, and I did not like being
lumped into a 'well-if-somebody-does-it-everybody-must-do-it' list.
I want folks to know that we acted honorably throughout this
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Battle, who with Payne was on Atlanta's original
volunteer bid committee and who now advises bid cities competing
for Olympics in 2008 and 2012, says even those cities are aware of
``agents'' offering to produce IOC votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these (bidders) say there are people who claim they
can help them with this constituency or that constituency,'' said
Battle, now president of Central Atlanta Progress. ``I'm aware of
people out there who claim they can help you. But I think it is
more influence or helping understand (IOC members) rather than
actually paying them money.''
</P>
<P>
   Battle echoed Payne, noting, ``I know we were never involved in
any of that, whether anybody approached us or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost from the moment in 1990 that Atlanta was the surprising
selection to host the Games over the favorite _ Athens, Greece _
rumors began that the city must have ``bought'' the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Greek newspapers proclaimed that Coca-Cola, historically a top
corporate Olympic sponsor, used its influence to win the Games for
its hometown. The newspaper Ethnos headlined a story: ``Coca-Cola
beat Athens.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, a German news magazine and an Australian newspaper
carried articles containing accusations that IOC members accepted
bribes for their votes.
</P>
<P>
   The influential magazine Der Spiegel reported in 1991 that
Atlanta Olympic officials offered IOC members gold credit cards,
free heart surgery, scholarships in American universities for their
children and cash bribes of as much as $120,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   Der Spiegel's report claimed that Australian and Greek Olympic
officials had a list of 18 IOC members who allegedly took bribes,
although none ever was identified.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations were unsubstantiated and denied by Atlanta
officials, but often they were based loosely on real incidents.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Atlanta committee did provide medical treatment
to David Sibandze, an IOC member from Swaziland, who suffered a
heart attack while visiting the city. ACOG paid for part of his
treatment at Piedmont Hospital, which wrote off the rest as a
courtesy.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1996 book, ``The New Lords of the Rings,'' British
journalist Andrew Jennings said ACOG paid college tuition for the
stepson of a powerful Russian Olympic official.
</P>
<P>
   Andrei Smirnov, the stepson of then-IOC executive committee
member Vitaly Smirnov, enrolled at the University of Georgia in
1991. Payne, a powerful alumnus and former football player, said he
worked on the younger Smirnov's behalf but never made payments. He
said the assistance never went beyond a few telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nine months after the vote, I was advised he was on the way to
the U.S. and his mom and dad were worried about him and wanted us
to help him get into some schools to learn English,'' Payne said
Monday. ``I recommend a lot of people every year for university
admission because I am asked to do so by friends. We helped him as
we would a son of any friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Petelin was enrolled at the university from 1992 through 1994,
but he received no scholarship money from the school or the
University of Georgia Foundation, said Tom Landrum, chief of staff
to university President Michael Adams.
</P>
<P>
   Landrum said school officials did not know the Russian student
was related to an Olympic official until they saw news reports of
the bribery allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Since allegations of vote-buying first arose, the IOC has
tightened its rules on travel, hospitality and gifts. Historically,
bidding cities offered IOC members and their spouses first-class
travel, lavish parties and luxury accommodations _ all in an effort
to tout their city's attributes.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta officials, for example, always paid expenses for IOC
members' trips to the city, including air fare, meals and lodging
at the Marriott Marquis. They also arranged housing in private
homes, threw parties and offered small gifts, such as silver mint
julep cups and Cabbage Patch dolls. Payne also hosted golf outings
to the fabled Augusta National Golf Club, which he was promoting as
a site for Olympic golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like any other business venture; you do a certain amount
of entertainment and building friendships,'' Battle said. ``These
don't involve bribes but do involve bringing them to your hometown.
And gift-giving is always going to be a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We in Atlanta have wonderful memories of our Olympic
experience,'' Payne said. ``Those memories will not be eroded by
unfounded accusations leveled at our integrity. We did nothing
wrong.''

the U.S. and his mom and dad were worried about him and wanted us
to help him get into some schools to learn English,'' Payne said
Monday. ``I recommend a lot of people every year for university
admission because I am asked to do so by friends. We helped him as
we would a son of any friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Petelin was enrolled at the university from 1992 through 1994,
but he received no scholarship money from the school or the
University of Georgia Foundation, said Tom Landrum, chief of staff
to university President Michael Adams.
</P>
<P>
   Landrum said school officials did not know the Russian student
was related to an Olympic official until they saw news reports of
the bribery allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Since allegations of vote-buying first arose, the IOC has
tightened its rules on travel, hospitality and gifts. Historically,
bidding cities offered IOC members and their spouses first-class
travel, lavish parties and luxury accommodations _ all in an effort
to tout their city's attributes.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta officials, for example, always paid expenses for IOC
members' trips to the city, including air fare, meals and lodging
at the Marriott Marquis. They also arranged housing in private
homes, threw parties and offered small gifts, such as silver mint
julep cups and Cabbage Patch dolls. Payne also hosted golf outings
to the fabled Augusta National Golf Club, which he was promoting as
a site for Olympic golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like any other business venture; you do a certain amount
of entertainment and building friendships,'' Battle said. ``These
don't involve bribes but do involve bringing them to your hometown.
And gift-giving is always going to be a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We in Atlanta have wonderful memories of our Olympic
experience,'' Payne said. ``Those memories will not be eroded by
unfounded accusations leveled at our integrity. We did nothing
wrong.''

<P>
   Two words come to mind when considering the practice of power
yoga. The first, inevitably, is ``oxymoron.'' Yoga is commonly
thought of as an activity designed to evoke a sense of serenity and
what practitioners call mindfulness, a meditative focusing on the
present moment.
</P>
<P>
   This raises the obvious question of what power has to do with
it, which brings us to the second word: sweat. To the uninitiated,
power yoga is not that different from other varieties of yoga, like
Hatha, the best known, other than that the pace is accelerated
considerably.
</P>
<P>
   But the purpose of power yoga is to build up body heat and, as a
result, sweat, which enhances flexibility and makes some of the
pretzel-like postures easier. It also purportedly purifies the body
of toxins.
</P>
<P>
   Power yoga is the modern name for variations of astanga yoga
(often spelled ashtanga), which makes it sound considerably less
trendy. It is rooted in a tradition that dates back several
thousand years.
</P>
<P>
   The name seems to have been concocted independently by Beryl
Bender Birch, who teaches power yoga at The New York Road Runners
Club and wrote ``Power Yoga'' (Simon and Schuster, 1995), and Bryan
Kest, who teaches at Dance Home in Santa Monica, Calif., where I
took my class.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Birch told me that she thought the name would enhance sales
of her book.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had called it Astanga Yoga,'' Ms. Birch said, ``it would
have sold five copies.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Hatha yoga, where poses are held for minutes and
punctuated by lengthy rest and meditation periods, the poses in
power yoga flow one to another without stopping.
</P>
<P>
   The pace builds up body heat, as does the breathing, known as
ujjayi breathing, which when done correctly _ through the nose and
down the back of the throat _ makes you sound like Darth Vader.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Birch told me that the most profuse sweaters are usually
beginners or those who have developed their strength through
lengthy practice.
</P>
<P>
   Power yoga has caught on recently in yoga centers and health
clubs because it feels like more of a workout than Hatha and builds
endurance as well as muscle strength and flexibility. It also
appeals to people who do not have the patience for Hatha, which I
didn't the one time I tried it.
</P>
<P>
   I decided to go to Dance Home for power yoga because Kest
teaches there, but he was out on the morning I went.
</P>
<P>
   The session was taught by Max Strom, who can usually be found at
a local center called Maha Yoga.
</P>
<P>
   Strom was wearing a black ``Peace in South Central'' T-shirt and
was big enough to play tight end for the Giants. But he emanated
enough serenity to instill confidence that he knew his business.
</P>
<P>
   Thin rubber mats were available to help our hands and feet grip
the ground while we did the yoga postures.
</P>
<P>
   I found a spot on the floor toward the back of the room _ old
habits die hard _ took off my shoes and socks and put them against
the wall along with a bottle of water I had brought, making sure
the latter was close enough to reach easily.
</P>
<P>
   By the time class started, about 70 people were in the room,
most of them women, and every body-length of floor space was taken.
</P>
<P>
   Strom spoke softly but distinctly, directing the class in a
series of postures. The first nine are known as sun salutations and
constitute a warm-up. The series feels like a slow, controlled
variation of the dreaded squat-thrust from high school gym class.
</P>
<P>
   Half an hour into the class, I was soaking, dripping and
exhausted. Strom repeatedly reminded us that yoga is about the
suspension of ego and competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   His message is don't strain and don't overdo it. You will hear
this message in every yoga class. It's this ``listen to your body
and stay within your limits'' attitude that should help prevent
injuries _ reportedly a problem among some beginning power yoga
enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   So it was surprisingly easy for a former jock _ especially one
aware of the copious failings of his 42-year-old body _ to rest and
watch the class go on.
</P>
<P>
   I sat back often, wiped down, drank water and observed my fellow
practitioners, some well into middle age, doing effortlessly what
was exhausting me. I found myself confronted with the undeniable
fact that virtually all of them _ through practice, I assumed _
were in a kind of shape that I couldn't even imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Although my usual workouts were five-mile runs and lengthy
sessions in the gym, these people had a sense of balance, strength
and flexibility that was, at the moment at least, beyond me.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the more intimidating balancing postures I didn't even
attempt at first. One, for instance, started in what is known as
the warrior position, which is a kind of static, yogalike
equivalent of a fencer's lunge.
</P>
<P>
   Then you put one hand on the ground next to your leading foot,
lift your back foot off the ground and, straight-legged, lift it as
high as possible. Yes. Right. Sure, I thought, while I wiped myself
down with my hand towel, drank water and passed on the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   I soon concluded that since just about everyone else was doing
the poses, they probably weren't as hard as they seemed.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, none of the postures were. And so it went. Moving
fluidly from pose to pose.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually we began winding down serenely, sitting cross-legged
on the mat _ or as cross-legged as my arthritic knees get _ and
``omming'' and ``ahhing'' en masse for a few minutes. We ended with
the final relaxation, known as shavasana, which Strom later told me
means corpse pose. We lay on our backs on the mats for 10 minutes
practicing our mindfulness. ``You're practicing being a corpse,''
he said. ``Yoga is supposed to be a lifetime practice. Each day at
the end of practice you lie down, knowing one day you will lie down
and leave the body where it lays. Or lies.''
</P>
<P>
   The experience of power yoga for me may have been perfectly
captured by something Strom said while he had the rest of us doing
a shoulder stand _ kind of a headstand for beginners with the legs
raised above the head pointing toward the ceiling, back supported
by the hands, and elbows, upper arms, shoulders and the back of the
head on the mat.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will get easier after your first year,'' Strom told us,
when you should be able to hold the pose for 20 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   I had my doubts. Yes. Right. Sure, I thought again, wondering if
this had become my mantra.
</P>
<P>
   I left, however, thinking that I would like to find out if he
was right. I spent the rest of the day wallowing, calm and smiling,
in the post-yoga equivalent of an endorphin rush. That night I
slept beautifully, and the next day I went back to begin working on
my shoulder stand.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to find a power yoga class is to call local yoga
centers or health clubs and ask for power, astanga, or even urban
yoga classes.

   &UR; Engulfed by a Snake &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How can a snake swallow prey that is bigger in diameter than
it is, like a whole rabbit?
</P>
<P>
   A. Most snakes have specialized body structures that let them
swallow things that are larger than their heads or necks, said
William Holmstrom, collection manager in the department of
herpetology at the Bronx Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   First, a snake's skin is very elastic, he said. Even more
important is the fact that the snake's jaws are made up of four
elements, not two, and they are only loosely attached with
ligaments that can stretch during feeding.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides of the upper jaw are independent, Holmstrom said,
and at the back of the bottom jaw, where there is a single
hingelike joint in other animals, a snake has an extra bone that
drops down so the two parts of the jaw can open to allow prey to
pass into the neck.
</P>
<P>
   A snake's ribs are also flexible, not fused to a sternum as they
are in human beings, so they, too, can spread and allow food to
pass down into the stomach. Finally, the whole process is pushed
along by a complex group of strong muscles.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few of our larger snakes have no trouble handling a 15-pound
rabbit, but they are 12 to 15 feet long,'' Holmstrom said.
</P>
<P>
   About 98 percent of snakes can do similar tricks with prey
appropriate to their size, but a few underground snakes that feed
on insects and soft-bodied invertebrates have lost the ability.

TWO GOP MODERATES ENDORSE IMPEACHMENT; SHAYS SAYS HE IS MULLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton got jolting news on the
impeachment front Monday when two undecided moderate House
Republicans announced they will vote for impeachment while Rep.
Christopher Shays, R-Conn., said he is reconsidering his support of
the president.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by the two moderates _ Reps. Frank LoBiondo of
New Jersey and Jim Walsh of New York _ was significant because the
outcome of the House impeachment vote later this week hinges on a
small group of moderate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   LoBiondo said he will vote for impeachment because ``I cannot in
good conscience allow the nation's chief law enforcement officer to
violate the law without consequences.'' Walsh said the prospect of
a Senate impeachment trial was less unseemly than the importance of
the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Another moderate, Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., said he will
disclose his decision on impeachment at a news conference Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Shays, previously a strong critic of impeachment, said he was
having second thoughts because he was ``troubled by the president's
statements and his continued inability to tell the American people
the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Shays said he would vote against impeachment if he were voting
today but that he wants to hear what his constituents say at a
community meeting Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   After Shays said he wanted to meet with the president to discuss
those views, the White House arranged a meeting after Clinton
returns Wednesday from his trip to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Shays was one of five Republican House members who had announced
their opposition to impeachment. The others are Reps. Peter T.
King, Amo Houghton Jr. and Jack Quinn of New York, and Mark Souder
of Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he appears to be wavering, Shays joined some two dozen
uncommitted Republican House members whose undeclared sentiments
have made the outcome of the impeachment vote impossible to
predict.
</P>
<P>
   The House is scheduled to begin debate Thursday on impeachment
charges that Clinton committed perjury, obstruction of justice and
abuse of power in connection with the coverup of his affair with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have a 228-207 majority in the House where a
majority vote in favor of one or more articles of impeachment would
trigger a Senate trial. If convicted by a two-thirds majority in
the Senate, Clinton would automatically be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   Shays, 53, who just won his 7th term, is known for his
independent stances. He was a key sponsor of the first major piece
of legislation to become law after the Republicans claimed control
of Congress in 1994. The Congressional Accountability Act, part of
the GOP ``Contract with America,'' required that Congress follow
many of the same health, labor and civil rights laws that apply to
the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Shays occasionally joins Democratic House members to vote for
environmental protection and abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Shays' press secretary Seth Amgott said the congressman hasn't
felt pressured on the impeachment issue except for his own desire
to do the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows he's not going to make any friends with this,''
Amgott said.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republican moderates in the House face possible
conservative challengers in the primary election if they don't
support impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The fear of enraging GOP party activists is probably greater
than that of alienating moderate voters, said Marshall Wittmann,
director of congressional relations at the conservative Heritage
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's party politics vs. general election politics,'' Wittmann
said. ``Party activists will have a longer memory than the general
electorate.''
</P>
<P>
   For the wavering moderate Republicans whose votes will determine
the fate of the president later this week ``the pressure doesn't
get any higher than this,'' Wittmann said. ``It's definitely not a
stress-free holiday season for them.''
</P>
<P>
   To swing moderates like Shays away from impeachment, Clinton
``is going to have to acknowledge that he lied or perjured himself
before the American people if not the grand jury,'' Wittmann said.
</P>
<P>
   Also announcing their support for impeachment were conservative
Republican Reps. Zach Wamp of Tennessee, Charles Bass of New
Hampshire and Rick Hill of Montana.

WHEN BARS SAY `NO' TO SMOKING

<P>
   In the line of duty, bartenders are exposed to more than their
share of other people's troubles _ and other people's cigarette
smoke. But while customers continue to pour out their woes at
neighborhood pubs, at least in California they aren't smoking while
they do it. The state banned smoking in bars as of last Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing an opportunity, a team of University of California
at San Francisco researchers took advantage of this natural
experiment to investigate the respiratory health of bartenders
before and after the law went into effect.
</P>
<P>
   The results, published in the most recent issue of the Journal
of the American Medical Association, indicate that even a month to
two months of daily toil in an environment newly free of
second-hand smoke can cause a significant reduction in symptoms
like coughing, eye and nose irritation and phlegm production, as
well as some improvement in lung function.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term exposure to second-hand smoke, according to evidence
from more than 35 studies of nonsmokers who live with smokers,
increases the risk of lung cancer by about 20 percent. (Active
smokers increase their risk by about 2,000 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   But passive smoking has mostly been studied in homes rather than
in the workplace, and only a small number of studies have examined
the short-term effects of exposure on health.
</P>
<P>
   Some workplaces, of course, are smokier than others. One
researcher calculated that second-hand smoke in bars was 3.9 to 6.1
times higher than in other office environments, and pointed to
billiard halls, bowling alleys, betting establishments and
restaurants as other traditionally smoky environments.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists studied 53 bartenders _ smokers and nonsmokers _
at 25 San Francisco bars, chosen at random. The bartenders were
given a baseline interview and lung-function tests in December
1997. Follow-up interviews and more tests were conducted four to
eight weeks after the law took effect.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 39 bartenders who reported respiratory symptoms in the
first interviews, 23 said in the second round that the symptoms had
abated. Forty-one bartenders initially reported irritation of the
eyes, nose, or throat; in the later interviews, 32 said they were
symptom free. Their lung function, measured by a portable
spirometer, also showed modest improvement.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits of reduced smoke in the workplace seemed to apply
equally to smokers and nonsmokers. Forty of the bartenders had a
history of smoking, including 24 who still smoked at the time of
the study. But ``respiratory symptoms and lung function improved in
both smokers and nonsmokers,'' said Dr. Mark Eisner, who led the
study.
</P>
<P>
   In their report, the scientists noted that a majority of the
bartenders (64 percent) said they ``strongly'' or ``somewhat''
disagreed with the smoking ban, making it unlikely that reports of
reduced symptoms were inspired by anti-smoking fervor. But 80
percent also said they believed that second-hand smoke had a
``slight'' or ``moderate-to-severe'' effect on their health.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have more difficulty studying passive smoking than
active smoking because it is much harder to measure second-hand
smoke exposure precisely, said Dr. Geoffrey Kabat, an associate
professor in preventive medicine at the State University of New
York at Stony Brook.
</P>
<P>
   The University of California scientists note that their study
has limitations, including the fact that the bartenders' exposure
to second-hand smoke is not assessed directly, and the possibility
that active smokers in the study may have reduced their smoking
outside work, accounting for a reduction in symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ichiro Kawachi, an associate professor at the Harvard
University School of Public Health, who has studied second-hand
smoke, called the new report ``impressive and important.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We always wonder about customers' exposure to smoking,''
Kawachi said, ``but of course the people who are most exposed are
the people working there.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States, Kawachi said, lags behind other countries in
restricting smoking in the workplace.

PALESTINE LEADERS RESPOND TO CLINTON URGINGS FOR PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAZA - President Bill Clinton Monday delivered the strongest and
most compassionate message ever by an American president to the
Palestinian people and convinced their leaders to move forward for
peace.
</P>
<P>
   With the first U.S. leader to set foot in Palestinian territory
at their side, hundreds of top Palestinian officials met a key
Israeli demand by reaffirming the annulment of sections of the
Palestinian charter that called for the destruction of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``By revoking them once and for all, you have sent a powerful
message not to the government, but to the people of Israel,''
Clinton told a packed audience of the Palestine National Council
and other Palestinian officials. ``You will touch people on the
street there. You will reach their hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the audience of about 1,000 stood with their hands
raised to signify a clear revocation of the offending language. In
doing so, they cleared away one of the major hurdles blocking the
next Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank scheduled to take
place Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, Clinton's dramatic trip to convince Israelis and
Palestinians of the benefits from the peace agreement he helped
forge at the Wye River Plantation in Maryland in October seemed to
be worth the effort.
</P>
<P>
   The focus now shifts to the Israelis. But there were signs that
the move may not have persuaded Israel to resume its troop
withdrawals from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very important step. I welcome it. It is a positive
step,'' Netanyahu said at a press conference after the vote.
``That's not enough, there have to be acts.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis insist that Arafat, among other things, must also
clearly retract his repeated assertion that he will unilaterally
declare an independent state on May 4, the day that would mark the
end of the interim peace process begun in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   A three-way meeting among Clinton, Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu is scheduled for early Tuesday at the Erez checkpoint
separating Israel and Gaza to strengthen further the fragile peace
process.
</P>
<P>
   The Wye agreement is a land-for-security deal that calls for
Israel to cede an additional 13 percent of the West Bank, which it
captured from Jordan in 1967, and for Palestinians to intensify the
fight against terrorism directed at Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had originally hoped that this trip would be a
celebration of Wye, which broke an 18-month deadlock in the
process. But it was transformed into a rescue mission to salvage
Wye as relations between the Israelis and Palestinians deteriorated
in the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the dark shadow of impeachment that threatens his
presidency, Clinton delivered what many observers considered one of
his most eloquent and forceful foreign policy speeches. With a firm
sense of evenhandedness, he addressed the crowd of aging guerilla
fighters, old men in red and white kaffiyahs, younger men in
business suits, Muslim clerics in turbins and Christian leaders in
black vestments. There was a noticeable absence of women in the
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Palestinians must recognize the right of Israel and its people
to live safe and secure lives today, tomorrow, and forever. Israel
must recognize the right of Palestinians to aspire to live free
today, tomorrow, and forever,'' Clinton said to thunderous
applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must acknowledge that neither side has a monopoly on pain
or virtue,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have reaffirmed the fact that you now intend to share this
piece of land without war with your neighbours forever... They have
heard you, they have heard you.
</P>
<P>
   ``You and they must now determine what territory you will have.
Will it be grudging and mean-spirited...or will it be generous and
open?'' he asked the leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The tone of the speech was remarkable in its candid recognition
of the difficulty Palestinians face in their daily life: ``For too
many Palestinians, lives are hard, jobs are scarce, prosects are
uncertain and personal grief is great.''
</P>
<P>
   These words would have been unthinkable from an American
president a mere a decade ago, when the United States would not
even allow its officials to talk directly to Arafat's Palestine
Liberation Organization.
</P>
<P>
   An exuberant Arafat introduced the president at the Palestinian
Authority's Shawwa Center, calling Clinton ``a president whom we
love and respect.''
</P>
<P>
   But his speech quickly turned to condemnations of Israeli
settlement expansion in East Jerusalem and in the West Bank and
Gaza. He also deplored the continued detention of Palestinian
prisoners in Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want our sons to return to their homes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat repeated Palestinian intentions to form a state with
Jerusalem as its capital but, importantly, he avoided previous
statements to do so next May.
</P>
<P>
   The day began with the president's helicopter descending over
the dust, palm trees and ramshackle refugee camps of Gaza - one of
the poorest and most crowded places on earth.
</P>
<P>
   After landing at the newly opened Gaza International Airport,
Clinton, accompanied by his wife Hillary and daughter Chelsea,
received a red-carpet welcome. Enormous U.S. and Palestinian flags
hung from the control tower at Gaza airport.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential motorcade sped along the Mediterranean coast
and through a security corridor to the conference center where
Clinton was to speak. Some 10,000 Palestinian police, clad in blue
fatigues and armed with automatic rifles, blanketed the city to
protect the Clinton entourage. They were joined by scores of
American Secret Service and CIA agents also discreetly stationed
along the route.
</P>
<P>
   The motorcade passed young children waving Palestinian and
American flags. There were banners that read, ``Bill Clinton:
Welcome to Palestine.'' And placards that stated in bold white on
black lettering ``We have a dream: Free Palestine.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Plaza of the United Nations, an elementary school band
dressed in red plodded through an spirited, if off-key, rendition
of the Star Spangled Banner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a great moment,'' said Ayman H'maida, 33, an
electrician, who stood with his 4 year-old son, Yusef, who waved a
small plastic American flag stapled to a stick. ``The president of
the greatest country in the world is visiting us for the first
time.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked why American flags were burned during anti-American
and Israel rallies just a few weeks ago yet now are waved on the
streets, H'maida answered, ``Those who were burning the flags don't
understand what peace means. They are off the track of those of us
walking toward peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Hazen Said, 22, was an active participant in the intifada
uprising a decade ago and in rallies where he took part in the
burning of the American flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I burned the flag because the US has always supported Israel
against the Palestinians. They never put real pressure on Israel to
secure human rights of Palestinans. When I see the kids waving
American flags now, I see a start, a new beginning of
American-Palestinian relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Marwan Kanafani, Arafat's spokesman and a Palestine National
Council member, said, ``This opens a new chapter between the
Palestinian people and America. We have never had a president speak
to us, our concerns, to the realities our life in this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanafani added, ``His words and our vote tonight prove that the
peace process is not in jeapordy because of a lack of US commitment
or a failure on our part to live up to the agreement. It's in
jeopardy because Netanyahu doesn't want to implement it.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were many Palestinian leaders who boycotted the vote,
showing that bitter feelings still exist.
</P>
<P>
   Younis Al Jarou, a central committee member of the Popular Front
for Liberation of Palestine, boycotted the ratification because it
was ``convened at Israel's behest.''
</P>
<P>
   He also sharply criticized the Palestine National Council as an
amorphous body whose very size remains unclear and which operates
without clearly posted procedures or rules of debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the voting today in the PNC will not satisfy Israel,'' Al
Jarou claimed to explain why he was not participating. ``They will
keep asking for more. No one now is saying we should throw Israel
into the sea, but they should not throw us into the sea either.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a decision that could help whistle-blowers, the
Supreme Court ruled Monday that a former employee of a home health
care company could sue the firm for damages after he claimed he was
fired for helping uncover its Medicare fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Ruling unanimously in favor of the employee, Michael A. Haddle,
the high court overturned two lower court decisions, which said
that state law permits an employer to fire workers without a reason
so long as they don't have employment contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Workers without such contracts, who make up a large percentage
of white-collar workers, are known as ``at-will'' employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hold that the harm alleged by (Haddle) ... has long been a
compensable injury and we see no reason to ignore that tradition in
this case,'' Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
   Haddle was a Medicare reimbursement expert for Healthmaster, an
Augusta, Ga., company that became the target of a federal Medicare
fraud investigation in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   On June 21, 1995, Healthmaster fired Haddle, allegedly because
he cooperated with federal authorities and because it wanted to
deter him from testifying in the pending criminal trial.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which had annual Medicare revenue of nearly $100
million, and three of its top executives eventually were charged in
a 133-count indictment. The owner, who pleaded guilty to 10 felony
counts, was sentenced to 33 months in prison and ordered to pay
$11.5 million in restitution. The two other executives also
received prison terms.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Haddle filed suit against the company using a
Reconstruction-era law that protects federal witnesses from
intimidation. He said the 1871 law was the only recourse for
private employees without job contracts who are fired for
cooperating with federal investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Haddle's case was dismissed by a federal district judge and
later by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Both ruled that
Healthmaster officials could not have conspired to take away
Haddle's job because he didn't have a legal right to employment in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The circuit court said that Haddle needed to show that
Healthmaster conspired to ``injure'' him or his property before he
could be allowed to use the 1871 law.
</P>
<P>
   But the Supreme Court disagreed, ruling that ``intimidation or
retaliation against witnesses in federal-court proceedings'' was
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that (Haddle's) employment is not property does not
mean that loss of his employment may not injure him,'' the court
said, adding it had found ``ample'' evidence that the ``conspiracy
here may give rise to a claim for damages.''
</P>
<P>
   Haddle's lawyer, Charles C. Stebbins, called the court's
decision a victory for his clients and other white-collar workers
who cooperate with federal investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ruling should send a strong message that people who help
the government and give truthful testimony in court will be
protected from being fired for doing their duty,'' Stebbins said.

FINDING DISTANT QUASARS  
 RETHINKING MARS  
 VULCANOLOGY FROM AFAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An ambitious effort to create a detailed map of part of the
universe has borne its first fruit, discovering the most distant of
all quasars. In fact, the project, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey,
has discovered three of the four most distant quasars, all in the
first few months of its operation.
</P>
<P>
   Quasars are about the size of our solar system but have a
brightness equal to 100 galaxies or more. The objects are not
completely understood, but are thought to have a massive black hole
at the center that draws gas and dust into it. The brightness is
the result of the extreme gravitational forces acting on the
material.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers measure distance by calculating how far toward the
red end of the spectrum light from an object has shifted. The
greater this red shift, the farther away the object is. The most
distant quasar has a red shift of 5.0; it is so far away that the
light reaching Earth began its journey when the universe was only a
billion years old. (It is not the most distant object yet
discovered, however. That distinction is held by a galaxy with a
red shift of 5.64.)
</P>
<P>
   The Sloan Survey, a collaboration of researchers at eight
institutions, plans to create a three-dimensional map of a quarter
of the sky. It uses two telescopes at an observatory in southern
New Mexico, one that performs the initial scans and another for
follow-up studies. Among other things, the project aims to
determine the red shifts for about a million galaxies and 100,000
quasars. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The first detailed topographical survey of the north pole of
Mars has been completed, and the results may force some changes in
theories about the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Using a laser altimeter aboard the Mars Global Surveyor
spacecraft, a team of researchers has determined that although the
Martian ice cap is about 10,000 feet thick, it sits in a bowllike
depression that is about 16,000 feet below the average elevation at
the equator.
</P>
<P>
   That poses problems for a common theory about water on Mars,
that it traveled from the pole to the equator in a subsurface
aquifer system. The new elevation data show that it would have been
practically impossible for such transport to occur.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also showed that the ice cap is smaller than
previously thought, with a volume about half that of the Greenland
ice sheet. Determining how much water there is on Mars, and what
happened to it, is crucial to unlocking the planet's history. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vulcanologists like to sample the gases produced by volcanoes,
``reading'' them for hints of the activity within. But gathering
gas samples in or near an active volcano can be, and has been,
lethal.
</P>
<P>
   Two reports in a recent issue of Nature, however, demonstrate
that remote sensing of volcanic gases is now possible. The studies,
at Popocatepetl in Mexico and Mount Etna in Italy, make use of an
instrument called a Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer.
</P>
<P>
   The spectrometer detects infrared light as it passes through,
and is absorbed by, a plume of volcanic gas. Because different
gases absorb different frequencies of light, the composition of the
plume can be determined.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem is finding a source of infrared light. Hot
rocks or lava are one such source, and occasionally scientists have
gotten lucky and located lava in the right place to take readings.
Other times an infrared lamp has been used, although placing one in
the field is often as hazardous as trying to sample gases.
</P>
<P>
   The two new techniques find their infrared in the sky. The Etna
researchers made use of the sun as a source, and were able to
analyze the volcano's plume from about seven miles away. The
scientists at El Popo, as the Mexican volcano is known, compared
readings of the plume against the sky versus those of the sky alone
to do their analysis from up to 10 miles away.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Admiring critics have made much of the fact that
``Wit,'' this season's hit off-Broadway play about terminal cancer
and chemotherapy, is actually not very sad. Instead, they have used
words like funny, tough and diamond-sharp. ``By the moment of the
stunning, final fade-out,'' wrote critic Peter Marks for The New
York Times several months ago, ``you feel both enlightened and, in
a strange way, enormously comforted.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of a recent performance, however, one of us in the
audience was feeling pretty depressed instead. That was me, a
doctor watching yet another scathing indictment of modern medicine
and the dubious habits by which some of us are either fortunate or
unfortunate enough _ take your pick _ to earn our keep.
</P>
<P>
   The surveys tell us not to worry, that even though Americans are
fed up with medicine, with doctors, with health care chaos in
general, they still usually like their own doctors and appreciate
their efforts. Or, as a patient of mine put it in the middle of a
tirade about a referral mix-up the other day, ``Oh, don't look so
sad. It's not YOUR fault.''
</P>
<P>
   It may not be our fault, but even so, we are inevitably a part
of it all, every last idiocy and atrocity that combines into the
kind of hospital experience depicted in ``Wit.'' And that makes for
a painful two hours to sit through, especially for those of us who
deliver a lot of bad news, and whose stock in trade are the
informed consent forms, the experimental treatment protocols and
the ``do not resuscitate'' orders that punctuate the care of
patients with very bad diseases like the metastatic ovarian cancer
ravaging the play's heroine.
</P>
<P>
   She is Vivian Bearing, a 50-year-old professor of English
literature who specializes in the difficult sonnets of John Donne,
the 17th-century metaphysical poet. The play takes her through
eight months of experimental chemotherapy that only makes her
sicker, a slow decline studded with a few major crises and a
hundred minor indignities, all seen through the prism of a
scholar's broadening understanding of the poetry of life and death.
</P>
<P>
   All the accouterments of cancer care in a sophisticated teaching
hospital are here, from the chilly waits in the radiology
department for the technician to come back from his break to the
pelvic exam that has to be repeated so that one more trainee can
feel her giant tumor. One of Ms. Bearing's doctors is remote and
pompous, the other slick and rude. Both talk in medical jargon
without translating. Both are hellbent on pumping her full of
experimental drugs; they care far more about Ms. Bearing's cancer
cells than about Ms. Bearing herself. Only her nurse manages to
coat the hospital routines with a thin sheen of humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Is this really the way we are?
</P>
<P>
   Not really, said Dr. Sherwin Nuland, a medical historian and
professor of surgery at Yale University, who loved the play. ``The
patient is a single incandescent character,'' he said, ``magnetic
and luminescent. The author knew her very well. But she didn't know
the others. The doctor roles are stick figures, straw men,
caricatures of the worst, completely unrealistic.''
</P>
<P>
   And is this really how experimental cancer treatment goes?
</P>
<P>
   Not at all, said Dr. Larry Norton, head of medical oncology at
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. ``People think
clinical research is removed from the patient, but it's the
absolute opposite. Our goal is to make sure that every patient in
the study gets the best possible care.'' Being in a research study
is in many ways safer than getting ordinary medical care, he said.
``It's the absolute opposite of being a guinea pig. People should
know that.''
</P>
<P>
   And is this really what being in a teaching hospital is like?
</P>
<P>
   Less and less so. There are certainly young doctors who could
use a little education in some basics _ like saying ``hello'' and
``goodbye'' to their patients _ but training programs are bearing
down on them with an increasingly heavy hand. Whole courses in
communication with patients, especially when there is bad news in
the offing, are becoming standard parts of the curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the bottom line is that none of these caveats really
matter. What matters is that the vision of ``Wit'' is the way it is
all perceived to be, in one of the few serious works of art of this
decade to fold details of contemporary medical practice into its
message _ and the way it will be remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty years ago Paul Muni as Louis Pasteur and Ronald Colman as
the fictional Dr. Arrowsmith thrilled and inspired their audiences.
Now the pendulum has swung around: It is the patients who are the
heroes, while the doctors have receded into sketchy caricatures
like the foolish, depraved medics Moliere created three centuries
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm saddened by the fact that the doctor is never
well-represented,'' Norton said. ``What we do and what we are and
what we have to deal with has never been captured by art. It's a
shame.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone to the other end of the spectrum,'' Nuland said. In
a generation, perhaps, ``we'll get to be ourselves again,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, onstage in ``Wit,'' Ms. Bearing's illness may be her
first problem, but her doctors and the hostile, humorless world
they inhabit and pull her into are most certainly her problems,
too. The audience roots for her against them all, the doctors in
the audience as fiercely as anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   But the one thing that Nuland, Norton and I know, even though
the rest of the audience, the playwright and possibly Ms. Bearing
herself may not, is that in their own limited, inarticulate way,
her own doctors are rooting for her, too.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Three years ago, when Patricia Buchanan, a 43-year-old woman
living in Brooklyn Park, Minn., consulted her doctor about fatigue
and a vague feeling of illness, she expected to be told that her
problems were due to smoking and excess weight.
</P>
<P>
   The diagnosis turned out to be much worse: She had hepatitis C,
a viral infection of the liver. She had probably been infected 15
or 20 years before, her doctor said, and, like 85 percent of all
patients, she had developed a chronic infection.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of people with chronic hepatitis C carry the
virus indefinitely, apparently with few ill effects. But about 20
percent develop cirrhosis and liver failure or cancer within 20 to
25 years of being infected. The infection causes 8,000 to 10,000
deaths per year in the United States, and it has become the leading
reason for liver transplants.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Buchanan's lab tests and a biopsy revealed scarring of the
liver, indicating that she might be one of the unfortunate ones in
whom the disease would worsen. Hoping to prevent further liver
damage, her doctor recommended drug treatment to try to rid her
system of the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Buchanan, who has four grown children and runs her own
business, a ceramics studio, had never even heard of hepatitis C.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was terrified,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   During the next two decades, many more Americans are expected to
find themselves in the same situation. Most will be middle-aged
people who feel fine now, but who will become ill, as Mrs. Buchanan
did, and find out they were infected years ago. Others will receive
letters from the government and blood banks as part of a program to
inform 300,000 people who may have been infected by transfusions
before 1992, when a test for the hepatitis C virus came into use.
For people like Mrs. Buchanan, with clear signs of liver damage,
doctors strongly recommend treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But those who test positive for the virus but have no signs of
disease will face difficult questions about whether to start
treatment, because it is expensive, complicated by severe side
effects and, in more than half of patients, unable to eradicate the
virus. Treatment is generally not recommended for those without
signs of liver damage, but regular monitoring is, because in the
early stages of infection it is impossible to tell whether the
disease will progress.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates
that four million Americans are infected with hepatitis C, and most
of them do not know they are carrying it.
</P>
<P>
   Those who know they need treatment may find themselves caught in
a controversy similar to the ones that have erupted over
high-priced treatments for AIDS. Their interests have collided with
those of a pharmaceutical company eager to recoup its research
expenses and turn a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some researchers say that the company,
Schering-Plough Corp. of Madison, N.J., is needlessly alarming
Americans about the disease in its advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Hepatitis C is spread mainly by exposure to infected blood.
There is no vaccine. Before the test for the virus came into use,
transfusions were the main route of transmission. Since then, the
number of new infections has plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   But Schering has called the disease an epidemic and has featured
on its Web site illustrations of people with the hideously yellow
eyes of jaundice, a symptom of severe liver disease. ``To put it
bluntly,'' the ads say, ``every living, breathing human being can
get hepatitis C _ even you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lancet, a British medical journal, says the advertising
campaign has ``breached the public trust.'' But in a telephone
interview, Robert Consalvo, a spokesman for Schering, said the word
``epidemic'' was reasonable, given that hepatitis C infects 4
million Americans and is the leading blood-borne infection in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Leonard Seeff, a senior scientist for hepatitis C research
at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive Diseases, said,
``The inference from the word `epidemic' is that people are getting
infected like crazy, and that's not so.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeff said he worried that fears about the disease, and the
pressure to test and treat everyone, would lead people infected
with the virus to take expensive drugs with potentially serious
side effects, whether they need them or not. He said more than 80
percent of those infected with the virus ``will survive with no
disease whatsoever.'' But he added that people with the virus must
never drink alcohol, because it accelerates liver damage from the
infection.
</P>
<P>
   Consalvo said Schering scientists believe that the earlier
patients start treatment, the better their chances of getting rid
of the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jay Hoofnagle, director of the division of digestive
diseases and nutrition at the National Institutes of Health, said:
``There's no epidemic going on now of hepatitis C. New cases have
fallen precipitously since the discovery of the virus. The
epidemic, if it occurred, occurred during the '60s and '70s, when
there was a lot of experimentation with drugs, and the virus got
into the population that donated blood. People infected then are
now turning 50 and 60, at which point hepatitis C rears its head.''
</P>
<P>
   Because some of those people will fall ill, a substantial
increase is expected in the demand for liver transplants, though
donor organs are already in short supply. Hepatitis deaths are also
expected to increase, possibly doubling or tripling to 20,000 or
30,000 a year within a decade or so.
</P>
<P>
   But the number of deaths will probably peak and then decline
again, because of the decline in new infections, Seeff said.
According to a CDC report issued in October, there were an
estimated 230,000 new infections each year through the 1980s. By
1996, the figure had dropped to 36,000.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the most common means of transmission is the sharing of
needles by drug users, which accounts for 60 percent of new
infections in the United States. Among those who have injected
drugs for five years, 90 percent are thought to be infected.
</P>
<P>
   The origin of the remaining 40 percent of infections is less
clear. Although sexual contact does not seem to spread hepatitis C
efficiently (unlike the AIDS and hepatitis B viruses), 20 percent
of infected people report no other means of exposure. Another 10
percent are thought to have been infected while working at a
hospital, undergoing hemodialysis for kidney failure, during birth,
or by sharing a toothbrush or razor or being exposed in some other
way to infected blood.
</P>
<P>
   For the final 10 percent, there is simply no explanation for the
infection. Despite widespread warnings about tattooing and body
piercing _ and the common-sense assumption that dirty instruments
could spread the virus _ the CDC says there is no evidence linking
those practices to the disease in the United States. Similarly,
many doctors suspect that people can transmit the virus by sharing
straws used to inhale cocaine, but researchers are not sure whether
that has occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Buchanan said she belongs to the ``no explanation'' group,
having never received a transfusion or taken drugs. Her husband and
other family members all tested negative for the virus, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, when she first learned she was infected, Mrs. Buchanan
enrolled in a study that provided six months of treatment with
Schering-Plough's version of the drug interferon, which eliminates
the virus in 10 to 20 percent of patients. But half of patients do
not respond to interferon at all, and Mrs. Buchanan was one of
those. At the time, interferon was the only treatment available.
</P>
<P>
   In June, a new treatment was approved by the Food and Drug
Administration, a combination therapy that paired interferon with
the antiviral drug ribavirin. The combination, Rebetron, made by
Schering-Plough, reduced the virus to undetectable levels in about
twice as many patients as interferon did.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even when it worked, Rebetron was not considered a cure, and it
had terrible side effects, including anemia, depression, suicidal
thoughts and severe flu-like symptoms. Nonetheless, Mrs. Buchanan
wanted to try the combination treatment. But because
Schering-Plough's brand of interferon had not worked for her, she
hoped to purchase the ribavirin alone and combine it with another
form of interferon, a slightly different one made by another
company. She had researched it on her own, and thought it might
work better for her. Her doctor agreed it was worth a try.
</P>
<P>
   She quickly found out that would not be possible.
Schering-Plough had ``bundled'' the two drugs, packaging them
together as a kit. Patients could buy Schering's interferon alone,
but not ribavirin. A company spokesman said the product was
packaged that way because there was no approved use for ribavirin
except in combination with interferon as a treatment for hepatitis
C.
</P>
<P>
   Because Schering-Plough had the exclusive right to market
ribavirin in the United States, there was no other way to buy it.
Mrs. Buchanan did not want to purchase the entire kit _ a six-month
supply costs $6,400 to $8,600 _ just to get the ribavirin.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Schering said the price of Rebetron reflected
the hundreds of millions of dollars it has cost to develop the
product.
</P>
<P>
   The bundling of Rebetron, which might seem a stroke of marketing
genius to a drug company, looked like a dangerous precedent to
people with hepatitis C. Many, like Mrs. Buchanan, wanted to mix
ribavirin with another company's interferon, and some, particularly
people who had received liver transplants, needed smaller doses of
interferon than the kit provided, but would be forced to throw away
the extra medication because it was perishable.
</P>
<P>
   The bundling also sent up a red flag among advocates for AIDS
patients. Some people taking a host of drugs to treat HIV also have
hepatitis C, and want as much flexibility as possible in picking
medications. The AIDS groups began showing hepatitis patients how
to do battle with big drug companies.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Getty, who is active in AIDS issues in San Francisco, said,
``The HIV and AIDS community is watching this and very much up in
arms about it, because we know what it means for us.'' Getty said
he feared that companies would similarly bundle combination
treatments for AIDS, interfering with doctors' ability to prescribe
different combinations for patients. ``Where does it stop?'' Getty
asked. ``Do I have to buy their Kleenex taped to their nose spray,
because they were tested together? This is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   One AIDS group has begun buying ribavirin from Mexico, which
imports it from a U.S. company. The group provides it to hepatitis
C patients at cost, which comes to less than half what ribavirin
would cost in the bundled product.
</P>
<P>
   Patients and advocacy groups asked the FDA to require that
Rebetron be unbundled, but Dr. Heidi Jolson, director of the
division of antiviral drugs at the agency, said its lawyers had
determined that it lacked the regulatory authority to do so. Jolson
did write to Schering-Plough, saying that the product did not have
to be bundled and that the agency would cooperate if the company
decided to sell the drugs separately.
</P>
<P>
   Consalvo, said Schering-Plough has listened to the concerns of
patient advocates and is developing a program to help provide
ribavirin to hepatitis patients whose doctors can prove that the
patients have a need for it. The program will start in January, he
said, though patients who need help sooner may get it if their
doctors contact the company.
</P>
<P>
   That was news to Mrs. Buchanan, who said her letter to the
company had never been answered.

 &HT;    JUDGE SCOLDS MICROSOFT LAWYER
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Microsoft attorney pressed a computer expert
Monday to admit that Windows 98 is a single, integrated product,
but U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson scolded the lawyer
for trying to bait the witness into making a careless error.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange took place during the cross-examination of Edward
Felten, a Princeton University computer science professor. Felten
repeatedly told the court that Microsoft had combined different
computer functions into four Windows files, making it impossible to
completely delete its Internet Explorer browser software.
</P>
<P>
   But in a 30-minute video, Felten showed the court how he was
able to write a 600-word program that ``disenabled'' Internet
Explorer without adversely affecting the Windows operating system.
The program made it possible to install Netscape Communications
Corp.'s competing browser without having Internet Explorer
occasionally appear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know of no reason why Microsoft was technologically
compelled to design things this way without consumer choice,''
Felten said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft attorney David Heiner insisted repeatedly that Felten
address the issue of whether it was possible to completely remove
all computer code related to the Internet Explorer browser
functions.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson interrupted, saying, ``He's told you a dozen times,
maybe more, that some of this code is related to browser
functionality and some of it is not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems you are trying to get the witness to commit some slip
of the lip, and I think that is an inappropriate
cross-examination,'' the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer moved onto another trouble spot when he asked Felten
whether his computer program caused problems with Microsoft's
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Felten charged that his program had not caused any problems with
Windows operating system until Dec. 4. Then he said Microsoft
changed functions in its Windows Update page on the Internet, which
allows users to download the software updates over the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``These changes occurred after I gave them the source code for
my program,'' Felten said.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Jackson intervened: ``You mean you gave them the source
code to your program and then they made changes to their operating
system?''
</P>
<P>
   Several minutes later, Heiner concluded his questioning and the
judge called a recess, ending Felten's cross-examination a day
earlier than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft spokesman Mark Murray said Felten was confused about
changes made to the Windows Update page. The problems arose, he
said, because the company on Dec. 4 had posted a test version of
Internet Explorer 5.0, not because the company was trying to
sabotage Felten's program.
</P>
<P>
   Felten's testimony has been billed as key to the government's
case because the Department of Justice and 19 states have accused
Microsoft of using its dominance in the operating system market to
also corner the browser market.
</P>
<P>
   In a federal appeals court case this summer, it was ruled that
Microsoft could bundle its browser into an earlier version of
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The lead government attorney, David Boies, said this trial is
focusing on another aspect of antitrust law: Whether Microsoft is
using its dominance in operating system to force consumers to use
their browser by tying it to the operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is whether the consumer can be given a choice,''
Boies said. ``And if a government witness can do it, then we feel
certain that Microsoft with all its software engineers can do it _
maybe even better.''
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft's attorney, John Warden, bitterly disagreed. ``All
this witness has done is remove the ignition key. He hasn't removed
the browser functionality at all.'' ``I expect the government to
come up with some competent proof that these are, in fact, two
different products. That hasn't been done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is scheduled to continue Tuesday and Wednesday with
the government's presentation of its final videotaped depositions,
including parts of the testimony of Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Question: We interviewed a very good applicant,
but when we took references, we found that he lied about being a
college grad. He did attend the college, but never graduated. We
asked him about this and he immediately apologized and said he had
never done this before. We need his expertise, and everything else
checked out perfectly. Do you think we should make him an offer?
D.A.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: In a word, everything checked out perfectly except this
applicant's honesty. The fact is that he apparently had no
difficulty looking you in the eye and boldly lying about his past.
Since he did this so well, it is possible that he has a good deal
of experience in this area.
</P>
<P>
   If you do hire him, you will never forget about this incident
and it's going to be difficult to fully trust him. He has
demonstrated that he is capable of lying quite effectively and if a
question arises concerning matters of ethics, theft, or
credibility, it will be difficult to give him the benefit of the
doubt.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of the larger picture, you need to decide how much
lying is tolerable in your company. At one end of the continuum,
you can conclude that the applicant apologized, learned the error
of his ways and deserves a chance. At the other end, you can take
the position that lying in your organization is absolutely
unacceptable. It will be quite telling to see where your
organization lies on this continuum.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The yearly evaluation is coming up, and I have a strong
feeling I am going to get a bad review because I don't get along
with my manager. He always gives me a hard time. For example, I was
10 minutes late the other day and he made a big deal about it, but
he said nothing to another employee who was late. Do I have a right
to refuse to sign my performance review? R.P.
</P>
<P>
   A: Before focusing on whether you should sign your performance
review, you should focus on a more important sign, namely the
working relationship with your manager. You do not need to wait for
a yearly evaluation to evaluate what is going on. The two of you
need to sit down, independent of the evaluation, and discuss the
work-related problems and the possible steps that you both can take
to correct them.
</P>
<P>
   As for signing the review, your signature typically does not
mean that you accept every point in the review as being an
undeniable truth. Rather, your signature indicates that you have in
fact read the review. Most performance review systems provide a
space for you to add your own comments. If there is no such space,
you can tell your manager that you will be writing a response to
the evaluation and you would like it included in the file. If you
write such an addendum, focus on the facts of your performance, and
not on the way your manager may have favored a co-worker.
</P>
<P>
   You might also suggest that your company consider using a
360-degree feedback process in which the employees evaluate their
supervision. This approach has numerous advantages, one of which is
that favoritism quickly falls out of favor.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have been posting memos and announcements on the company
bulletin board, and in recent months someone, or perhaps more than
one person, has been marking them up and adding snide comments that
are supposed to be funny. I have heard that this is part of humor
at work, but I see it as destructive. Is this type of thing
acceptable now? K.G.
</P>
<P>
   A: Although humor at work is a growing trend, your letter may
also indicate another growing trend: employee sabotage. Humor at
work is supposed to be uplifting and clever. It does not mean
destroying company property or ridiculing a company's programs.
</P>
<P>
   Sabotage typically comes from disgruntled employees. Perhaps
there has been a recent downsizing and they feel insecure, perhaps
the anticipated bonuses are not going to happen, or maybe the
employees feel that the company has treated them inequitably. As a
result of these kinds of developments, they are striking back.
</P>
<P>
   It may be worthwhile to have more direct communication with the
employees in order to develop a clearer picture as to how they feel
about the company. To the extent that significant levels of
dissatisfaction are found, there are probably actions that
management can take to correct at least some of them.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it will also be important for the employees to
understand that sabotage of any kind is not going to be tolerated.
In a word, employees who are working against the company are not
going to be working for the company.

   Trinity Investment Management Corp., a private money management
firm whose Boston-based owner and chairman is seeking to retire,
agreed Monday to be acquired by OppenheimerFunds Inc., a New
York-based mutual fund firm.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the deal was not disclosed, but financial sources
put the sale price at around $175 million. The transaction, typical
for smaller investment companies whose owners are seeking to
convert their assets into cash before retiring, allows Trinity to
retain its name, staff, offices, and computer-driven investing
style.
</P>
<P>
   The deal marries Trinity's $8.2 billion in accounts managed for
institutions with OppenheimerFunds' $97 billion in mutual fund
assets, and paves the way for Trinity chairman Stanford Calderwood,
78, to retire. Trinity will be an independent unit of
OppenheimerFunds' institutional money management arm, Harbor View
Asset Management.
</P>
<P>
   Rumored for months, the deal makes Trinity ``the centerpiece of
our institutional money management effort,'' said Len Darling,
executive vice president of OppenheimerFunds.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction involves a portion of cash paid up front and a
series of payouts to Trinity's six other shareholders over five
years, according to Trinity spokesman Richard Tucker. The
executive-shareholders will continue to run the company, while
Calderwood, who had owned around 50 percent of the firm, would exit
the business.
</P>
<P>
   OppenheimerFunds, the nation's 13th largest fund firm, is a unit
of Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. of Springfield, Mass.

<P>
   Mattel Inc.'s plan to buy Learning Co. and establish a larger
presence in the educational and entertainment software business is
just the latest step for a toy company and a toy industry that are
trying to reinvent themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, the world's largest toymaker announced its
proposed $3.2 billion acquisition on the same day that it shocked
Wall Street by saying that sales of its famous Barbie doll products
could fall 12 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Learning Co. acquisition could further
California-based Mattel's strategy to transform itself into a sort
of hybrid toy-and-entertainment software company that is less
dependent on traditional toys such as Barbie and on
brick-and-mortar retailers such as Toys ``R'' Us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Age compression'' may be a key phrase in understanding why
Mattel wants to buy an educational-software company known for such
products as ``Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?'', and the
game ``Myst.'' Or maybe the operative word is ``KAGOY.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an acronym for `kids are getting older younger,''' said
Diane Cardinale, the assistant communications director for the Toy
Manufacturers of America, an industry trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Once a child would get a Barbie doll or a G.I. Joe action-figure
at age 4 or 5, then play with it until he or she turned 10 or 11.
No more. Today's computer-savvy children quickly tire of rag dolls
and toy soldiers. At an early age, they want educational software
such as the CD-ROMs made by the Learning Co. or video games from
the likes of Sony and Nintendo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are going on the computer in kindergarten,'' said editor
Chris Byrne of Playthings Marketplace, an industry newsletter.
``Kids are giving up traditional toys by 6 or 7.''
</P>
<P>
   Mattel chairman and chief executive Jill Barad acknowledged as
much in a conference call with Wall Street analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the process of transforming ourselves from a
traditional toy company into a global children's products
company,'' said Barad, who noted that the acquisition of Learning
Co. could mean that nearly a quarter of Mattel's sales could come
from interactive products.
</P>
<P>
   That was the good news. The bad news, which caused Mattel's
stock price to plunge, was that sales for Mattel's traditional toys
have been nearly flat. This holiday season, consumers seem
reluctant to pay full price for traditional toys, noted Salomon
Smith Barney analyst Jill Krutick.
</P>
<P>
   After US consumers shelled out $22.6 billion for traditional
toys in 1997, the toy manufacturers group was expecting a 1998 gain
of 3 percent, with just more than half the annual total coming
around the holidays. But in light of Mattel's announcement, that
forecast may be too optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, sales of video games, which are measured separately
from traditional toys, are on pace to jump 32 percent from the 1997
total of $5.1 billion, according to the NPD Group, a research firm
based in Port Washington, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   For educational and entertainment software, the kind made by the
Learning Co., NPD said sales will rise about 4 percent in 1998,
according to Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   With the sales for traditional toys cooling, toymakers want to
gain a bigger presence in the hot educationalandentertainment
market, just as brick-and-mortar retailers are looking for ways to
avoid getting stuck with unwanted inventory.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, Toys ``R'' Us has revamped its ordering
policies. Faced with competition from giant discounters such as
Wal-Mart and Target, Toys ``R'' Us wants to be lean and mean.
</P>
<P>
   That has translated into fewer orders to its chief suppliers,
Mattel and Hasbro Inc., the industry's No. 2 toy maker. In recent
months, both Mattel and Hasbro have complained that new Toys ``R''
Us inventory policies have squeezed their profits.
</P>
<P>
   For Hasbro, of Pawtucket, R.I. the 1999 outlook may be brighter.
Two of its toys are holiday hits, Furby and Teletubbies, and movie
licensing agreements have it poised to exploit next year's release
of the first of three ``Star Wars'' sequels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think Hasbro has solid underlying product momentum,'' said
analyst Krutick, who covers both Hasbro and Mattel.
</P>
<P>
   As Mattel looks to the future, the acquisition of the Learning
Co., of Cambridge, Mass., could help with its goal of lessening its
dependency on bricks-and-mortar retailers such as Toys ``R'' Us.
</P>
<P>
   The Learning Co. sells some of its software directly to schools
and some of its product directly to consumers through toll-free
telephone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   And the maker of the American Girl doll series, another recent
Mattel acquisition, relies heavily on catalog sales.
</P>
<P>
   Distribution aside, Toy Book editor Jim Silver sees Mattel's
purchase of an educational software company as a smart move.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big problem for the industry is that children are growing
up much faster,'' he said. ``The toy companies are looking for ways
to hold onto kids as long as they can.''

 CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: THE PHOTOS THAT CHANGED POLLOCK'S LIFE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By SARAH BOXER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The figure of Jackson Pollock _ action painter,
dancing dripper, sullen rebel _ was formed in Hans Namuth's camera.
Namuth's camera helped make Pollock famous, Namuth's camera was
blamed for Pollock's demise and, after Pollock died in a car crash
in 1956, Namuth's camera tried to catch the artist in his coffin.
(The funeral home didn't allow it.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, on the occasion of Pollock's retrospective at the Museum of
Modern Art, Namuth's camera is there again. Namuth himself died
eight years ago (also in a car crash). But his photographs and
films are being used to strip away the layers of paint and lore
that have covered Pollock since the 1950s. Of course, the stripping
is tricky, because Pollock's tortured relationship with Namuth is
itself part of the myth.
</P>
<P>
   In the late summer of 1950, Namuth, a photographer for Harper's
Bazaar with a marginal interest in Pollock, arranged to shoot him
painting in his studio. But when Namuth got to Pollock's house in
Springs, in East Hampton, N.Y., he was told there was nothing to
shoot. Pollock had just finished a painting. He and Lee Krasner,
his wife, took Namuth out to the barn to look.
</P>
<P>
   ``A dripping wet canvas covered the entire floor,'' Namuth
recalled in ``Pollock Painting'' (1980), a book of his photographs.
``Blinding shafts of sunlight hit the wet canvas, making its
surface hard to see. There was complete silence.'' Namuth went on:
``Pollock looked at the painting. Then unexpectedly, he picked up
can and paintbrush and started to move around the canvas. It was as
if he suddenly realized the painting was not finished. His
movements, slow at first, gradually became faster and more
dancelike as he flung black, white and rust-colored paint onto the
canvas.''
</P>
<P>
   Namuth started photographing Pollock at work on the painting
that would become ``One: No. 31, 1950.'' Ms. Krasner sat on a high
stool, watching.
</P>
<P>
   When Namuth showed the proofs to Pollock and Ms. Krasner, they
let him loose in the studio. Namuth took more photographs,
capturing the beginning stages of ``Autumn Rhythm: No. 30, 1950.''
But it was not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Namuth decided he wanted to catch the painter in motion. He shot
a black-and-white film of Pollock painting, first from eye level,
then from a loft high above the barn floor. Still not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Namuth wanted a movie of Pollock in color. Paul Falkenberg, a
film editor who had worked with Fritz Lang, agreed to help. At
first Namuth filmed Pollock painting outside on a red canvas that
is now lost. Pollock did a strenuous grapevine dance step as he
worked along the length of the canvas. Namuth got Pollock's
characteristic strokes: the way he drew with paint by gently
rotating his wrist, finishing with his palm up, and the way he
splatted by snapping his wrist and finishing with his palm down.
Still not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Namuth was unhappy about having to choose between focusing on
the painting or on Pollock. He wanted to catch painter and paint at
once. Finally, as Namuth remembered later, he dreamed up a
solution: ``The painting would have to be on glass, and I would
film from underneath.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollock built a wooden platform to hold the glass. And Namuth
crouched under it to ``record the loops of liquid paint as they
fell,'' as Barbara Rose, an art historian and critic, wrote in an
essay in ``Pollock Painting.'' As Pollock painted on the glass, the
paint covered up his view of Namuth beneath him, but in the film it
was just the opposite: Pollock's face and figure were gradually
veiled by his own paint.
</P>
<P>
   At last, the marathon photography session ended dramatically on
a cold November day in 1950. Namuth and Pollock were winding up
their work. Ms. Krasner was inside the house preparing a feast to
celebrate the end of the filming. Pollock was tense. As the 1989
biography ``Jackson Pollock: An American Saga,'' by Steven Naifeh
and Gregory White Smith, tells it, Pollock was sick of putting on
his paint-spattered boots again and again for the camera, shaking
an object out of one boot again and again, getting ready to paint
again and again, and asking Namuth again and again: ``Should I do
it now, Hans?'' He was ready to blow.
</P>
<P>
   When Pollock and Namuth came in from outside, blue from the
cold, the first thing Pollock did was pour himself a tumbler of
bourbon. It was the beginning of the end. Pollock had been sober
(some say) for two years. Soon Namuth and Pollock got into an
argument _ a volley of ``I'm not a phony, you're a phony.'' Then
Pollock tore a strap of cowbells off the wall and started swinging
it around.
</P>
<P>
   With the dinner guests seated and food on the table, Pollock and
Namuth continued to argue. Finally Pollock grabbed the end of the
table, shouting ``Should I do it now?'' to Namuth. ``Now?'' Then he
turned over the whole table, plates, glasses, meat, gravy and all.
(There is a scholarly disagreement about whether it was turkey or
roast beef.) The dogs lapped at the glassy gravy. Ms. Krasner said,
``Coffee will be served in the living room.''
</P>
<P>
   After that night, Pollock never stopped drinking. He didn't
bring in the glass painting (``No. 29, 1950'') until it was covered
with rain and leaves. He returned to a more figurative style of
painting. Six years later, bloated, depressed and drunk, he drove
his car into a tree, killing himself and a friend.
</P>
<P>
   According to Pollock lore, his relationship with the camera was
a Faustian bargain. No one has ever said it bluntly, but the
implication is that Namuth killed Pollock, that the photographs
stole the artist's ``savage'' spirit. In doing things for the
camera that he once did more spontaneously, Pollock came to feel he
was indeed a phony. The photographs that made him famous also
sealed his doom.

</P>
<P>
   The Namuth photographs have had a life of their own. They were
first published in 1951 in Portfolio, a review edited by Franz
Zachary and Alexey Brodovitch. Soon after, Art News magazine
published them to illustrate Robert Goodnough's influential essay
``Pollock Paints a Picture.'' Later in 1951, the Museum of Modern
Art screened the color film. And after Pollock died, the pictures
really took off. Articles on Pollock were often illustrated with
Namuth's photographs rather than the paintings. Why?
</P>
<P>
   It was Namuth's images more than Pollock's paintings that
grabbed the public's imagination, Ms. Rose wrote in ``Pollock
Painting.'' A rhetoric developed around them, a language of trances
and rituals, boxing and dancing, rhythm and randomness. Even the
critics based their theories on the photos. Harold Rosenberg's
famous 1952 essay in Art News, ``The American Action Painters,''
was not about painting at all, Ms. Rose suggests. Rosenberg ``was
describing Namuth's photographs of Pollock.''
</P>
<P>
   The photographs changed art and art history, Ms. Rose wrote, by
focusing ``on the act _ the process of art-making _ instead of on
the static object.'' Pollock's early critic, Clement Greenberg, had
seen an allover, knit-together style in the paintings, a
disembodied, optical web, and he studiously avoided analyzing how
Pollock achieved it. But thanks to the photographs, a new
generation of artists _ including Richard Serra, Bruce Nauman, Carl
Andre, Robert Morris, Eva Hesse and Claes Oldenburg _ saw something
else. They weren't just looking at Pollock's paintings, they were
looking at Pollock painting.
</P>
<P>
   One of those artists was Allan Kaprow. In ``The Legacy of
Jackson Pollock,'' published in Art News in 1958, he credited
Pollock with destroying painting by placing ``an almost absolute
value on a kind of diaristic gesture.'' Pollock was hailed as the
founder of the Happening, the man who embodied a new generation's
``ambitions for absolute liberation.''
</P>
<P>
   Namuth's photographs inspired new kinds of art in the 1950s and
'60s. In the 1970s and '80s, they were read as art criticism. In
``Hans Namuth: Art Critic,'' a 1977 essay, Jean Clay, an art
historian, observed that when Namuth photographed Pollock from
above, he intentionally mimicked Pollock's relationship to the
canvas, to point out how radical it was to paint on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   In an essay in ``Pollock Painting,'' art historian Rosalind
Krauss took a similar tack. She suggested that by taking aerial
photographs, which make the ``sculptural dimensions of reality''
ambiguous, Namuth was trying to emphasize the unreality of the
paintings, ``that gravity-free, optical space to which Greenberg
refers in his descriptions of Pollock's art.'' But Namuth's
photographs went beyond Greenberg, she suggested. Because they were
shot from above, they showed the very real, physical manner in
which the paintings' optical effect was created (from above). Ms.
Krauss turned Namuth into a critic of a critic.
</P>
<P>
   Now, judging from Pepe Karmel's essay on Namuth's photographs in
the catalog for the Pollock retrospective, the use of the
photographs is changing again. Karmel, in effect, puts the
paintings back on the wall. He treats the photographs not as
criticism but as hard evidence to settle some unsolved mysteries:
Was Pollock controlled or wild? What is the anatomy of a splat? Are
there figures hiding in the webs of paint? How did Pollock get
rhythm?
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the full sequence of Namuth's still shots is
available, revealing the evolution of a few paintings. The
distortions of foreshortening and the dizzying angles of those
photographs have been undone (by computer), so the paintings in
them look as undistorted as if they were on the wall. Karmel has
used Namuth's color film to dissect Pollock's gestures with the
brush. And he has analyzed the black-and-white film, which he has
identified as a chronicle of ``No. 27, 1950,'' to study the
underlayers.
</P>
<P>
   From the black-and-white film, Karmel learned that Pollock did
not begin with abstract splats but with carefully dripped figures.
Pollock drew two humanoid figures and a she-wolf and then buried
them in a web of splats. When the web covered the pictographs, the
eye could no longer focus on them, but instead jumped from splat to
splat. Thus, Karmel concludes, Pollock's work was divided into two
campaigns, first figurative drips, then abstract splats.
</P>
<P>
   From the still photographs documenting ``One'' and ``Autumn
Rhythm,'' Karmel learned that Pollock painted figures, obscured
them, then overpainted the abstract layers with more figures,
creating a semi-abstract, semi-figurative web.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Pollock Pollock, he says, is not the drip technique,
which other painters used, nor allover abstraction, which other
painters achieved, but the rhythmic energy that comes from the
alternation of figure and splat. Pollock was not a man in the grip
of a savage dance. He was always in control. As Pollock himself
once reportedly put it, ``I choose to veil the image.'' Karmel has
confirmed Pollock's self-report. But questions still remain: Why
did he veil it? And why did he stop veiling it in 1951?
</P>
<P>
   After Pollock watched ``projections of himself working,'' Ms.
Rose said, he abandoned the poured technique and returned to a more
figurative style. Did he feel that hiding the figures in his
abstractions was futile after Namuth exposed them? Was he trying to
develop a painted image that could compete with his own heroic
figure in Namuth's photographs? Did he come to think the drip
paintings were phony because they were so photogenic? Or was he
simply ready to move on?

   Astronomers see seeds of life in star's makeup
</P>
<P>
   By Dick Stanley
</P>
<P>
   C. 1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   Genesis has one version of creation, and astronomy has another.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomy says we all come from supernovas, dying stars whose
explosions seeded what became Earth and us with calcium, carbon and
the 101 other chemical elements that we share with the sun, planets
and stars. But what kind of supernovas is a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Now, University of Texas astronomer Chris Sneden and colleagues
elsewhere believe they have found the first solid clue to the
identity of our progenitors. It's a unique star that may have been
one of the first recipients of the seeding from a class of
supernovas that could have been the granddaddies of us all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neat stuff,'' said J. Craig Wheeler, a UT astronomer whose
speciality is supernovas. ``I find it stimulating.''
</P>
<P>
   Sneden and colleagues from the University of Oklahoma and
Carnegie Observatory in Pasadena, Calif., found their special star
during a routine study of some old stars in a thin halo surrounding
our Milky Way galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   Sneden's specialty is calculating the amount of elements present
in a star, as revealed by the signatures of chemicals in the star's
electromagnetic radiation. His brand of stellar accounting helps
scientists like Wheeler figure out what the supernovas that seeded
the stars were like before they blew up.
</P>
<P>
   Though supernovas are believed to be routine events in the long
life cycles of stars, their origins remain elusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons (astronomers) got so excited about the
supernova in 1987 in the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy,'' Sneden
said, ``was because for the first time ever we knew the star
beforehand.''
</P>
<P>
   Supernovas occur when a star's fusion furnace starts to run out
of fuel and begins to consume the star itself. The resulting
explosion creates a cloud of gas and chemical elements, called a
nebula, which during the course of billions of years coalesces to
become new stars that will begin the cycle anew.
</P>
<P>
   Other remnants of supernovas, meanwhile, turn into weird things
like pulsars, neutron stars or black holes.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers believe the nebula that became our sun and its
planets was made by many supernovas throughout the history of our
Milky Way galaxy. But what kind of supernovas is the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you try and figure out the different element proportions
in the solar system and what kinds of supernovas were responsible,
you can't,'' Sneden said.
</P>
<P>
   Until, perhaps, now. The star that Sneden and colleagues found
``has a distribution of elements that looks an awful lot like the
element distribution in the solar system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The star has the unromantic designation of CS 22892-052. CS
stands for Campanas Star, meaning it was first charted by
astronomers at Las Campanas Observatory near Santiago, Chile.
</P>
<P>
   The star isn't impressive looking. It's just one of the
thousands of bright dots in the night sky. It's what's inside it
that makes it unique.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was really strange and noticeable about it right away,''
Sneden said, ``was there were more of the exotic, heavy elements
(uranium, lead, mercury, etc.) than we had any right to expect in
such an old star.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging from its amount of thorium, a radioactive element that
loses half its atoms every 14 billion years, the researchers dated
the star at between 13 billion and 16 billion years old.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the sun is only about 4.5 billion years old.
</P>
<P>
   After analyzing the star's proportions of heavy elements, the
researchers concluded that they could only have come from a
particular kind of supernova _ and a nearby one at that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had to be a local thing that donated this freakishly high
number of heavy elements,'' Sneden said. ``We've never been able to
say that about a star before.''
</P>
<P>
   Sneden and his colleagues have applied for observing time on the
Hubble Space Telescope to try to learn more about their star. They
hope to use it as a basis for the more complicated problem of
figuring out what kind of supernovas made the chemical elements in
our solar system.
</P>
<P>
   But the supernova itself, a possible predecessor of our ancestor
supernovas, is long gone.
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler speculates that it probably was a star of the necessary
size to turn into a neutron star after the blast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's floating around in intergalactic space somewhere,''
Wheeler said. ``But we have no idea where.''

<P>
   SAN MIGUEL USPANTAN, Guatemala _ For Rigoberta Menchu, the
painful road to world prominence began in this impoverished and
isolated tangle of mountains, cloud forest and peasant hamlets. As
winner of the 1992 Nobel Peace Prize, she has become an
internationally acclaimed spokeswoman for _ and symbol of _ the
rights of indigenous peoples, based largely on her best-selling
account of growing up here as an uneducated and oppressed member of
the Quiche people.
</P>
<P>
   In the autobiography ``I, Rigoberta Menchu,'' first published in
Spanish in 1983 at the height of Guatemala's brutal civil war, Ms.
Menchu, now 39, tells a wrenching tale of violence, destruction,
misery and exploitation as moving and disturbing as a Victor Hugo
novel. So powerful was the book's impact that it immediately
transformed her into a celebrated and much-sought-after human
rights campaigner and paved the way for her being awarded the Nobel
Prize.
</P>
<P>
   Key details of that story, though, are untrue, according to a
new book written by an American anthropologist, ``Rigoberta Menchu
and the Story of All Poor Guatemalans.'' Based on nearly a decade
of interviews with more than 120 people and archival research, the
anthropologist, David Stoll, concludes that Ms. Menchu's book
``cannot be the eyewitness account it purports to be'' because the
Nobel laureate repeatedly describes ``experiences she never had
herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Using contacts provided by Stoll and others found independently,
The New York Times conducted several interviews here earlier this
month that yielded information that contradicts Ms. Menchu's
account. Relatives, neighbors, friends and former classmates of
Rigoberta Menchu, including an older brother and half-sister and
four Roman Catholic nuns who educated and sheltered her, indicated
that many of the main episodes she related in the book were either
fabricated or seriously exaggerated. As they recall it:
</P>
<P>
   The land dispute central to the book was a long and bitter
family feud that pitted her father against his in-laws, and not a
battle against wealthy landowners of European descent who
manipulated government agencies into trying to drive her father and
other Indian peasants off unclaimed land that they had cleared and
farmed.
</P>
<P>
   A younger brother whom Ms. Menchu says she saw die of starvation
never existed, while a second, whose suffering she says she and her
parents were forced to watch as he was burned alive by army troops,
was killed in entirely different circumstances when the family was
not present.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to Ms. Menchu's assertion in the first page of her book
that ``I never went to school'' and could not read, write or speak
Spanish until shortly before she dictated the text of ``I,
Rigoberta Menchu,'' she in fact received the equivalent of a
middle-school education as a scholarship student at two prestigious
private boarding schools operated by Roman Catholic nuns.
</P>
<P>
   Because she spent much of her youth in the boarding schools, it
is extremely unlikely that she could have worked as an underground
political organizer and spent up to eight months a year laboring on
coffee and cotton plantations, as she describes in great detail in
her book.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in September, Ms. Menchu repeatedly declined to
respond to the discrepancies the Stoll manuscript raises. ``I'm
proud of the book,'' she said, describing it as ``part of the
historical memory and patrimony of Guatemala'' and dismissing any
criticism as part of a racist political agenda intended to gain
attention and publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been 15,000 theses written about me all over the
world by people who have read the book and made commentaries about
it,'' she continued, referring to her autobiography, which has been
translated into at least a dozen languages. ``I don't dedicate
myself to checking this, and I don't deny or contradict what is
said in books about me. That's not my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Menchu declined repeated requests this month for comment.
</P>
<P>
   With one exception, the people interviewed in Guatemala have not
read her book and were sympathetic to Ms. Menchu and the trials she
and her family underwent during Guatemala's 36-year civil war,
which ended in 1996. Between 1979 and 1983, Rigoberta Menchu's
father, mother and two brothers all died at the hands of government
security forces, everyone here acknowledges.
</P>
<P>
   ``She suffered greatly, seeing her whole family dispersed by the
violence,'' said Clemente Diaz Cano, a neighbor and contemporary of
Ms. Menchu. ``The truth may be distinct from how she has told it,
but that does not mean Rigoberta did not suffer greatly in those
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The exception is Alfonso Rivera, one of the few people here who
has actually read Ms. Menchu's autobiography. As the clerk for the
municipal government for 30 years, he kept all official records.
``The book is one lie after another, and she knows it,'' Rivera
said. ``When she visited here, I asked her how she could say such
things, and she could not give me a satisfactory answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Geir Lundestad, director of the Norwegian Nobel Institute and
permanent secretary of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, said in a
telephone interview from Oslo that he was aware of the Stoll
manuscript and had no reason to doubt its veracity. Nevertheless,
he said, ``there is no question of revoking the prize'' to Ms.
Menchu.
</P>
<P>
   ``All autobiographies embellish to a greater or lesser extent,''
he continued. He added that the decision to award the prize to Ms.
Menchu ``was not based exclusively or primarily on the
autobiography'' and that while ``the details of the family history
are not without relevance, they are not particularly important, and
so this will lead to no reconsideration on our part.''
</P>
<P>
   During the last year, Ms. Menchu has sought to distance herself
from her autobiography. Any problems with the text, she suggested,
are the responsibility of Elisabeth Burgos, the Venezuelan
anthropologist who interviewed Ms. Menchu, transcribed and edited
the resulting 26 hours of tapes and secured a publishing contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the protagonist of the book, and it was my testimony, but
I am not the author,'' Ms. Menchu maintained during the September
interview, describing her current relationship with Ms. Burgos as
``nonexistent'' because of a disagreement over publishing
royalties. ``She gave the book its final form, so she is officially
the author of the book and has the commercial rights to it.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a new book published in Spanish this spring and in
English in October, ``Crossing Borders'' (New York: Verso Books),
Ms. Menchu asserts precisely the opposite. She maintains there that
she had full and final authority over her autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   ``I censored various parts that seemed imprudent to me,'' Ms.
Menchu writes in the new book. ``I removed the parts that referred
to our village, a lot of detail about my little brothers, many
details about names.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from her home in Paris, Ms. Burgos said
that ``every phrase in the book comes from what Rigoberta Menchu
said on the tapes.'' She said she still has the original
recordings, some of which she allowed Stoll to listen to, and is
willing to make them available to a university so that other
researchers can have access to them.

H-E-B HITS IT OFF WITH MEXICAN GROCERY CUSTOMERS 

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MONTERREY, Mexico _ The store is as bare bones as possible.
</P>
<P>
   No background music. No high-priced, fancy deli. No glossy
displays at the end of each aisle.
</P>
<P>
   Floors are concrete, and staples like cereal boxes and flour are
stacked ceiling-high.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the shoppers stream into H-E-B's new Economax here as if it
were giving away food.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't need marble floors to sell tomatoes,'' said Miguel
Angel Suarez Arellano, the store's manager.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. grocers have been crossing the border into Mexico for
years. But it's only been since last year, when the economy
stabilized, that grocery chains have made their first real gains.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico is an enormous market, ripe for the picking: 96 million
consumers who spend 3.5 times more of their disposable income on
groceries than Texans.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most aggressive entrant into the Mexican market is
San Antonio-based grocery chain H-E-B, which in 1999 plans to open
seven more stores south of the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S.-based grocery stores are doing quite well,'' said Chuck
Gilmer, editor of the Shelby Report, a trade publication based out
of Gainesville, Ga. ``A lot rides on the stability of the economy
down there.''
</P>
<P>
   The strengthening economy in recent years and the massive market
base have encouraged hundreds of retailers to set up shop in
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   A drive through downtown Monterrey, population 3.5 million,
shows that people here dine at Kentucky Fried Chicken, rent
subtitled U.S. movies from Blockbuster Video, enjoy a scoop of ice
cream from Baskin Robbins or lease the popular Nissan Sentra from
Thrifty.
</P>
<P>
   Among the first major retailers entering the Mexican market was
Wal-Mart seven years ago. Things apparently have gone so well for
Wal-Mart that in June of last year, the Bentonville, Ark., company
paid $1.2 billion to take a 53 percent controlling interest in
Cifra, Mexico's largest retailer.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart has 27 stores in Mexico and Sam's Club has 31. Cifra,
its partner, has nearly 200 other grocery stores in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Kmart Corp. followed Wal-Mart into the Mexican grocery market,
teaming up with retailer El Puerto de Liverpool. But Kmart's
experience wasn't as successful as Wal-Mart's.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1997, Kmart announced the sale of its three
hypermarkets in Mexico City and another store in Cuernavaca to
Contoladora Comercial Mexicana, the second-largest retail chain in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   But about the same time the Troy, Mich.-based retailer was
getting out of the Mexican supermarket business, H-E-B made its
move into the market, spending nearly $23 million to open two
grocery stores in Monterrey.
</P>
<P>
   But these, unlike the Economax, were no ordinary grocery stores.
</P>
<P>
   The chain, which has 253 U.S. stores, went great guns for the
Mexican market, building elegant grocery stores.
</P>
<P>
   The first store the chain opened is flanked by Monterrey's
famous Chipinque Mountains and is located in the exclusive
Garza-Garcia subdivision.
</P>
<P>
   It's massive, at 75,000 square feet, and had a price tag of $8
million.
</P>
<P>
   Because Mexicans often shop with several family members, store
planners added an indoor playground in the corner of the building
for the kids.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a bakery, coffee shop and deli.
</P>
<P>
   And finding an excuse to throw a party, H-E-B officials did just
that before opening day. Nearly 1,000 guests attended, including
the mayor of the suburb and the state's governor.
</P>
<P>
   And on opening morning, the store was blessed.
</P>
<P>
   The $15 million, 80,000-square-foot H-E-B store in the Contry
subdivision in Monterrey wasn't to be outdone and similar
festivities were held for its opening months later.
</P>
<P>
   ``H-E-B has primarily targeted upscale demographics down there
and has met with some real success,'' Gilmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Economax is a new concept for H-E-B, which rang up $6 billion in
sales last year. Essentially they are low-cost versions of the
Pantry stores it offers in Texas. It's the exact opposite of the
two all-frills stores H-E-B opened last year.
</P>
<P>
   The 38,000-square-foot store, a steal at only $3 million to
construct, stands in the shadow of a low-rent apartment project.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Colonia Hacienda los Morales warmly welcomed the
grocery store to the neighborhood and were greeted by a salesman
dressed as the store's mascot, a blue and yellow bee named Max.
</P>
<P>
   Store officials reported more than 9,000 sales receipts a day
during opening week in October. Lines trailed off onto the parking
lot, said H-E-B's spokeswoman in Mexico, Lola Landa. Even a week
after the store opened, it was difficult getting through the
crushing crowd at the front door.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the store said interest has not waned and they're
bagging 7,000 sales a day.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers marveled over the low prices one weekday morning as
they filled their shopping carts with hamburger meat, sweet bread
and spices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came for the first time to see how the prices were,'' said
Maria Elvia Andrade de Valdez, who was inspecting the store's
assortment of spices with her husband, Raul Valdez Zuniga.
</P>
<P>
   The couple was so pleased with their first visit they said they
would return with their children and grandchildren to do their
weekly shopping here.
</P>
<P>
   Like the other two Monterrey stores, Economax will sell H-E-B's
low-cost brand of Texas' Hill Country Fare goods. And the company
is working on a Mexican brand called Tierra Linda, which will
include a line of salsas, oils and purees.
</P>
<P>
   Landa said Economax is filling a niche in the Mexican community,
serving the needs of low-income consumers like the Valdezes.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the recent plunge in the Mexican peso and
inflation at 18 percent because of the global financial crisis,
Suarez said Economax is helping consumers stretch their peso.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Mexico we have had problems with the economy all of our
lives,'' Suarez said. ``We're in front of the difficult economic
conditions. The people have to eat no matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   Five of the stores the company plans to open next year likely
will follow the Economax style and most will be built in the
northern Mexico city of Monterrey, company President Howard E. Butt
III said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   But competitors like Ignacio Toussaint, head of corporate
finance for the Grupo Gigante, one of Mexico's largest chains, said
he's not too worried about small player H-E-B yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``That store is doing very well, but it's only one store,''
Toussaint said. ``We have 18 stores in the Monterrey area.''

 SAN MIGUEL USPANTAN: to them.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As published, ``I, Rigoberta Menchu'' portrays Vicente Menchu
Perez, his wife, Juana Tum Cotoja, and their nine children, of whom
Rigoberta was the sixth, as rigorous Christians forced by poverty,
Indian blood and lack of education to endure unending misery and
exploitation. In the end, the entire family becomes involved in a
peasant movement, but members are either cruelly killed or driven
into exile by Guatemalan security forces.
</P>
<P>
   The unifying thread of the tale is the 22-year struggle by
Vicente Menchu to gain title to fertile land that he cleared and
tilled himself, but that was coveted by wealthy ranchers who
harassed him with lawyers and gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not how people here, including close relatives,
remember the situation. As they tell it, Vicente Menchu was locked
in a battle with Antonio Tum Castro, his wife's uncle, and his
sons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tums were our enemies,'' Rosa Menchu Calam, the Nobel
laureate's 58-year-old half sister, said in an interview here.
``They were always cutting the barbed wire on our fences, and they
would send their animals into my late father's fields to eat our
corn so that we would not have enough to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosa Menchu's recollections were echoed by other residents of
this remote town of 5,500 people. Their account is also supported
by more than 600 pages of government records on file at the
headquarters of the National Agrarian Transformation Institute in
the Guatemalan capital.
</P>
<P>
   The records cover more than 30 years, and indicate that the
Menchu and Tum families repeatedly challenged each other's claims
to a fertile parcel of 373 acres that both wanted, and frequently
filed complaints about each other's behavior. There is virtually no
mention of the Brol, Garcia or Martinez families, the
Spanish-speaking landlords that Rigoberta Menchu asserts sought to
drive her father off his land.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it was a family quarrel that went on for years and
years,'' said Efrain Galindo, who was mayor of Uspantan from 1970
through 1972. ``I wanted peace, but none of us could get them to
negotiate a settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   People interviewed here also expressed skepticism about Ms.
Menchu's account of the death of two of her brothers. In one of the
most heartbreaking episodes of the book, Ms. Menchu tells how in
1967 she watched her youngest brother, Nicolas, die of malnutrition
while the family was working for slave wages on a coffee plantation
in southern Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   But Nicolas Menchu turns out to be alive and well, the owner of
a well-kept homestead here. He is 49, a full decade older than his
famous sister, and said in an interview that he had no recollection
of a younger brother who died in the fashion described in the book,
an affirmation later repeated by Rosa Menchu.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had two brothers who died of hunger and disease, one named
Felipe and another whose name escapes me,'' Menchu said. ``But I
never knew them, because they both passed away before I was even
born, and I was born in 1949.''
</P>
<P>
   Family members and residents expressed similar doubts about Ms.
Menchu's account of the death of another brother, Petrocinio. In
her book, she describes how she, the rest of her family and fellow
residents of Uspantan were summoned to the nearby town of Chajul,
where her younger brother and other prisoners were lined up.
Gasoline was poured over them, and ``then the soldiers set fire to
each one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents here have many grievances against the army and were
quick to recount other abuses. But they could not recall an
incident anywhere in the region of a mass public execution by
burning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Around here, nobody was ever burned alive that way,'' said
Diaz, the neighbor of the Menchu family. ``It was a dirty war here.
They kidnapped you from your home, and nobody knew where you were
killed. That's how Petrocinio and a whole lot of other people
died.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know exactly what happened to Petrocinio,'' said
Nicolas Menchu. ``I know that he was kidnapped and handed over to
the army. After that, I heard that they kept him in a hole, and
that then they shot him.''
</P>
<P>
   According to family members and residents, Petrocinio's body was
dressed in the olive green uniform of the guerrillas and dumped,
along with the corpses of several other youths suspected by the
army of sympathizing with insurgents, in the town square in Chajul.
``Some acquaintances of my father recognized his body and sent news
that he had been killed,'' Nicolas Menchu said.
</P>
<P>
   Family members, neighbors and the nuns who educated her were
even more emphatic that Rigoberta Menchu received a level of
education unusual at the time for an Indian girl. In her
autobiography, Ms. Menchu maintains that she never received any
formal schooling, in part because her family labored on the
plantations, but also because her father did not want it.
</P>
<P>
   But ``my father thought that life was hard and that there was
nothing here for us, no school at all,'' Nicolas Menchu said. ``He
had a lot of ideas, and since he couldn't read or write a letter
himself, he believed it was necessary for us to get as much
instruction as we could.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicolas and Rosa Menchu, who with their other siblings received
only a rudimentary education, said that Rigoberta was singled out
for special treatment because Belgian nuns who were friends of the
family thought her unusually bright and promising. They recalled
their little sister correcting their imperfect Spanish and proudly
showing off her ability to read and write when she visited home on
vacation from boarding school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rigoberta was about 5 years old when my father enrolled her in
school,'' Nicolas Menchu said. ``She went off to boarding school in
Chichicastenango and stayed there for about three years before
returning.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Rosa Menchu, Rigoberta had to come back because the
family was experiencing money problems. But as she and the family's
friends and neighbors tell it, the Belgian nuns again came to the
rescue, arranging for Rigoberta to live in their convent here while
she attended school in town for a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our congregation had a very close relationship with the Menchu
family,'' said Sister Magdalena van Meerhaege, a 60-year-old
Belgian nun from the Order of the Sacred Family who confirmed the
arrangement. ``Her father was a catechist, and when we went up to
do work in their area, her mother fed us.''
</P>
<P>
   In separate interviews, Sister Magdalena and three other nuns,
all affiliated with the Order of the Sacred Family and the private
school they operated, the Belgian-Guatemalan Institute, clearly
recollected Rigoberta as a gifted pupil. They said she studied at
their school in the capital and a branch in the province of
Huehuetenango, completing the equivalent of the first year of
junior high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you for certain what years those were, because we
no longer have the records,'' Sister Magdalena said. ``But I do
know that when her father was killed in January 1980, Rigoberta had
just enrolled in her second year of middle school'' and was not
working as an underground political organizer, as she maintains in
her autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Guatemalan school year runs from mid-January to the
end of October, classmates and relatives said, it would have been
virtually impossible for Rigoberta Menchu to have spent up to eight
months a year working as a farm laborer, as she maintains in her
book. ``Since she was studying, she couldn't go to work on the
plantations,'' said Rosa Menchu.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, Stoll concludes that Ms. Menchu drew on experience
common to others in Guatemala and ``drastically revised the prewar
experience of her village to suit the needs of the revolutionary
organization she had joined'' and on whose behalf she was touring
Europe when she dictated her life story to Ms. Burgos.
</P>
<P>
   ``By presenting herself as an everywoman, she has tried to be
all things to all people in a way no individual can be,'' Stoll
writes. As a result, it is necessary for readers ``to distinguish
between what can be corroborated and what cannot, what is probable
and what is highly improbable.''

MUSCLES REGROWN IN MICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Researchers believe they have found the fountain of muscular
youth in a gene that, when injected directly into skeletal muscles,
keeps them from wasting with age and even returns elderly muscles
to youthful size and vigor.
</P>
<P>
   The genetic trick has worked so far only in mice, but its
results are so dramatic, reliable, and persistent _ and free of
adverse consequences so far _ that the researchers plan to try it
in humans as soon as they win federal regulators' approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``For skeletal muscle it is, essentially, a fountain of youth,''
said H. Lee Sweeney of the University of Pennsylvania in an
interview Monday shortly before presenting the results at a
scientific meeting in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists said the research could lead to an array of new
possibilities in human aging and disease _ preventing the muscle
weakness that inevitably accompanies aging, halting or slowing the
ravages of diseases such as some types of muscular dystrophy, and
possibly even rejuvenating failing hearts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible we could really prevent the muscle wasting of
age and greatly improve people's `health span,' '' said Anna
McCormick of the National Institute on Aging, which helped fund the
research. ``Issues of side effects and ethics have to be looked at,
but that doesn't decrease our excitement that you can actually
intervene in muscle aging.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Sweeney's findings and other experiments by Boston
coworkers mark ``the first experimental demonstration that you can
preserve muscle mass and strength in an old animal.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney and his colleagues injected muscles with genes for a
protein called insulin-like growth factor type 1, or IGF-1,
packaged in the shell of a virus that causes no disease. Once
inside muscle cells, the gene produces an extra boost of IGF-1,
which normally sustains muscle maintenance and repair. The effect
persists for the rest of the animals' life.
</P>
<P>
   The IGF-1 gene therapy produced an average increase of 15
percent in muscle mass and 14 percent in strength in young adult
mice, and it prevented the ravages of muscle aging.
</P>
<P>
   Perhap more remarkably, the researchers returned old mice to the
muscular status of young adults, with a 27 percent average increase
in strength in muscles that got gene injections.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we injected very old mice _ the human equivalent of about
80 _ they got stronger, but we couldn't get them back to the
young-adult level,'' the Pennsylvania scientist said.
</P>
<P>
   In separate experiments not yet published, Nadia Rosenthal of
Massachusetts General Hospital transplanted genes for IGF-1 into
mouse embryos, creating ``Arnold Schwarzenegger mice,'' as they're
dubbed, that never suffer age-related muscle wasting.
</P>
<P>
   The gains in muscle size and strength in Sweeney's mice occurred
even though they were sedentary. ``Now we want to combine the gene
injections with exercise,'' he said. ``My prediction is that the
injected muscles will respond much more rapidly and with greater
benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Using gene therapy to bulk up without exercise could be both a
boon and a bane. On the favorable side, it could keep many elders
active and independent even if they can't exercise enough to
sustain maximal strength. A 10 percent-15 percent gain in strength
might do, Sweeney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this might be something that would allow anyone to
maintain functional muscle mass _ not just the Jack LaLannes,'' he
added, referring to the pioneering body-builder who maintained his
physique into his seventies.
</P>
<P>
   However, IGF-1 gene injections could raise troubling issues of
abuse, both among athletes (whose use of the enhancer could be
detected only by surgically sampling muscle tissue) and among those
who want cosmetic effects without the workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to walk around LaJolla to get the idea there
are people who would eagerly go down to Tijuana to get a few
injections so they'd look better on the beach,'' Sweeney said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the research has a long way to go before those issues
materialize. Among other things, Sweeney wants to try gene therapy
in animals with disorders that mimic muscular dystrophy, and
ultimately in humans with a mild form called Becker muscular
dystrophy, which afflicts 18,000 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're on the verge of a lot of exciting things,'' said
Dr. Leon Charash, chairman of the Muscular Dystrophy Association's
medical advisory board.

CLINTON ALLIES WAGE GRASSROOTS CAMPAIGN TO BATTLE IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Defenders of President Clinton, led by Vice
President Al Gore, intensified efforts Monday to rally a grassroots
campaign to persuade the Republican-led House to reject impeachment
in favor of censure.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton allies accused GOP congressional leaders of turning
their backs on public opinion that favors bipartisan censure to end
an 11-month struggle brought on by the president's sexual dalliance
and alleged cover-up of an extramarital liaison with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-impeachment chorus reached beyond the White House to
include a radio advertising blitz by the liberal advocacy group
People for the American Way, as well as grassroots organizing
efforts by the Democratic Party, the AFL-CIO and the National
Partnership for Women and Families.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have concluded that Clinton's behavior was ``terribly
wrong,'' but that he ``should not be impeached and removed from
office,'' Gore insisted in an appearance at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The unwillingness of Republican leaders in the House to permit
consideration of a censure motion thwarts ``any kind of compromise
along the lines that the American people want to see,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican congressional leaders insist that censuring a
president is not an option given the House by the U.S.
constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The latest nationwide public opinion surveys, however, detected
a slight softening of support for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A CNN/USA Today survey released on Sunday found 38 percent
favored impeachment _ up from 32 percent before the House Judiciary
Committee adopted four articles of impeachment over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   As for the president's resignation, 37 percent voiced support
for Clinton stepping down _ up from 33 percent in September.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Craig, the White House lawyer orchestrating the
anti-impeachment operation, said in an interview on NBC News'
``Today'' program that Americans want Congress to adopt a ``motion
of censure, which would be bipartisan and would bring this matter
to a close.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, scheduled to return to Washington from Israel late
Tuesday, said in Jerusalem on Monday that he had offered ``to make
every compromise with Congress'' in order to bring the episode to a
speedy conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   House leaders planned to reach a decision on Tuesday on the
rules that will govern the scheduled debate Thursday on four
articles of impeachment for perjury, obstruction of justice and
abuse of power. Those articles were recommended by the House
Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   People for the American Way, a liberal advocacy group founded by
television producer Norman Lear, ordered a $75,000 radio blitz in
three cities in an effort to persuade eight moderate Republicans to
vote against impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jean Collins, the organization's vice president for field
operations, said radio advertising in Philadelphia is designed to
reach voters in districts represented by Reps. Jon Fox and Jim
Greenwood of Pennsylvania; Michael Castle of Delaware; and
Christopher H. Smith of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcast ads in Columbus, Ohio, will reach voters in the
congressional districts of Reps. David Hobson, Rob Ney and Deborah
Pryce, Collins said. Ads in the District of Columbia are designed
to sway voters in the suburban Maryland district of Rep. Connie
Morella.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have awakened,'' Collins said. ``It's finally sinking
in that Clinton might be impeached.''
</P>
<P>
   A toll-free telephone line used to patch callers through to the
Capitol Hill switchboard has been inundated with 130,000 telephone
calls in 72 hours, Collins said. The toll-free line received 17,000
telephone calls between midnight and noon on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been completely overwhelming,'' Collins said. ``People
are just hopping mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers said that grassroots efforts to forestall impeachment
are coalescing around a Thursday prayer vigil planned by civil
rights activist Jesse Jackson on Capitol Hill as the House
considers impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Dion, spokeswoman for the AFL-CIO, said the nation's
largest coalition of labor unions is helping to organize grassroots
rallies as well as the national vigil on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   AFL-CIO President John Sweeney is scheduled to join Jackson to
address the rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Union folks are outraged at what is going on,'' Dion said.
``People are looking for what they can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said ``thousands of people'' are expected for the rally.
``It's pretty amazing given the short time we've had to get it
organized.''
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Ratcliff, spokeswoman for the Democratic Party, said the
party headquarters has urged state party leaders to enlist
Democratic officials in the grassroots campaign to dissuade a vote
on impeachment in favor of censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are urging people to call radio talk shows, write to their
members of Congress or write letters to the editor,'' Ratcliff
said.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Judith L. Lichtman, president of the National Partnership for
Women and Families, said in a statement that Clinton ought to ``pay
a price for his shameful behavior'' in the form of a censure to
``bring a just and swift end to this destructive process.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen organizations representing women, led by the
National Organization of Women and the Feminist Majority, have
scheduled a news conference in Washington on Tuesday to urge
congressional censure rather than impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-impeachment campaign has been built upon momentum
generated by an Internet-based organization _ www.MoveOn.org _ that
began operations before the Nov. 3 congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   The operation, ``Censure and Move On,'' has helped funnel
telephone calls to People for the American Way that then relays the
calls to members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't act now, the president will be impeached,'' the
Internet organization said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The organization urged readers to telephone Rep. Bob Livingston,
R-La., the incoming speaker of the House, to appeal for House
consideration of a censure vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he lets his party members vote their conscience,
impeachment will probably die and members will vote censure,''
MoveOn.Org counseled. ``If he continues to threaten the `full wrath
of the Republican Party' to members who break ranks, the President
will be impeached on a purely partisan vote.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER _ US Representative Charles Bass of New Hampshire has
left the small group of House Republicans in the undecided column
and cast his lot with those calling for the impeachment of
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In a lengthy statement issued late Monday Bass called his
decision ``one of the most arduous'' he has ever made as an elected
official. ``Yet my conscience is secure in the knowledge that what
I do is in honor of and respect for the truth,'' Bass said. ``This
is not about punishing the president. It is about restoring and
protecting the integrity of the office, the rule of law, and the
Constitution of the United States,'' Bass said.
</P>
<P>
   The full House begins debate Thursday on the four articles of
impeachment passed by the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, we are faced with two difficult choices: hold
the president accountable for his crimes by supporting articles of
impeachment or turn a blind eye to his criminal activity,'' the
second-term Republican representative said.
</P>
<P>
   Calls from the congressman's constituents were split roughly
equally between pro- and anti-impeachment camps. No member of the
House Republican leadership called Bass to sway his vote and the
congressman did not return the one call he received from a White
House staffer seeking to lobby him on behalf of the president, said
Bass's press secretary, Sally Tibbetts.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bass had to beat a Democrat to win his seat in what has
been a historically Republican district he emphasized that citizen
input was only one factor in his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``To yield to polls in the face of such criminal conduct, I
maintain, would be dangerous to our constitutional government,''
Bass said. ``It would mean that popular presidents who have
committed high crimes and misdemeanors could escape impeachment
simply because they are strong in the polls.''

 By M.R. MONTGOMERY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A minor Boston outpost of the Smithsonian Institution
disappeared last month. Almost no one noticed, but those who did
are variously disappointed, outraged, and discouraged.
</P>
<P>
   It was, until just before Thanksgiving, the 28-year-old Boston
office of the Archives of American Art, a one-man operation on
Beacon Hill. The Archives survives, but all its regional offices
were closed on Nov. 23 in a budget decision that irritated and
flabbergasted its local advisory committee.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Master-Karnik, a committee member, called ``vital'' the
archive's task of collecting the papers and business records of
artists and galleries and museums. Those that it doesn't collect,
it microfilms for the convenience of scholars.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the now-unemployed archivist in the Boston office,
Master-Karnik added that ``what Bob Brown did was essential to
collecting, he knew everybody, he stayed in touch with everyone. He
did enormous work with ... papers that are critical to scholars and
museums.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who was surprised, if not stunned, by the closing of his
office and the end of nearly 30 years of employment by the
Smithsonian, said last week that the great shame was not merely
closing his office, but abandoning the concept of collecting
records and materials nationally. ``There was not a serious attempt
to raise money'' to continue the work of the regional offices, he
said. ``There was never an explicit appeal. In fact, I was never
hired to do fund-raising; I was told explicitly that `fund-raising
is not in your picture.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara de Marneffe, former chair of the New England advisory
committee and now a trustee of the Archives of American Art,
acknowledged that there had been rumors and hints that the regional
offices would be closed, but still, when the word came in
September, it was a shock. ``There wasn't any question of keeping
the office open,'' she recalled, ``and when officials came up from
Washington it wasn't to discuss the decision, it was just to
explain it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Smithsonian couldn't continue to fund it,'' de Marneffe
added, ``at least they could back us in fund-raising. We're hoping
to raise private funds; we're going to notify the New England
congressional delegation. Taking a full-time collector away from
New England is very, very shortsighted.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan now is to send out collecting teams from the
Smithsonian headquarters when a gallery closes or an artist's
papers become available. ``That just doesn't work,'' according to
Sinclair Hitchings, curator of prints at the Boston Public Library
and another member of the advisory committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The returns from Bob Brown's collecting have been fabulous.
He's got a retentive memory and a network of friends and contacts.
As for the officials at the Smithsonian,'' Hitchings added, ``they
are defiantly wrongheaded.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, ``defiantly'' is an adverb that applies to many actions
since the closing was announced. Relations between the director of
the archives, Richard J. Wattenmaker, and his Boston committee,
couldn't be more defiant. Concluding a written response to
complaints from staff at the Museum of Fine Arts, Wattenmaker noted
that the Boston committee hadn't raised any serious money since the
1970s, and had no authority to tell him how to run his department.
In a letter in The New York Times, he asked rhetorically: ``When
the Museum of Fine Arts put up that ugly shopping mall wing, did I
call them up and say, `Why are you putting all this trash in the
museum?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Wattenmaker's final thought on the matter, referring to
criticism from two curators at the MFA, Jonathan L. Fairbanks and
Theodore Stebbins, was simple: ``How about they run their business,
and the Smithsonian runs its business?''
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been,'' the BPL's Hitchings remarked, ``some
gratuitous nastiness.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown is looking for a job, and Hitchings and a few others are
hoping that some arrangement can be made not only to keep him
employed, but to keep the paper and microfilm flowing to
Washington. But no one is very hopeful. The problem, Hitchings
concluded, was that those people in Washington didn't understand
the rest of the country.

DIVIDED COURT REINSTATES CALIFORNIA MURDERER'S DEATH SENTENCE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Stands for SCOTUS-DISABLED) 
 
By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A sharply divided Supreme Court on Monday summarily
reinstated a murderer's death sentence _ at least for now _ and
ordered a lower court to reconsider whether the trial judge
confused the jury with inaccurate instructions before the panel
condemned the defendant.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual 5-4 decision for which no justice claimed
authorship, the court acknowledged that a California judge
incorrectly told the jury that the governor could commute a life
sentence without parole. But the high court majority, which took
the rare step of issuing its decision without first hearing
arguments, ruled the judge's mistake might have had no effect on
the jury's final verdict to sentence Russell Coleman to death.
</P>
<P>
   Although the majority opinion's author was not disclosed, a
stinging dissent was signed by the court's liberal quartet of
Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg
and Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision overturned a 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals ruling that the trial judge's mistake improperly led the
jury to condemn Coleman out of fear that he could one day be
released by a sympathetic governor. California law, in fact,
requires that four state Supreme Court justices approve a
governor's decision to commute a life sentence without parole for a
twice-convicted felon such as Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court returned the case to the 9th Circuit and
told that court to decide if the judge's mistaken instruction had a
``substantial and injurious effect or influence on the jury's
verdict.''
</P>
<P>
   By process of elimination, the five members of the majority were
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia,
Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   In other action, the high court agreed to consider whether the
federal Americans with Disabilities Act allows states to treat
mentally disabled people in an institution even if the individuals
can receive adequate care while living at home.
</P>
<P>
   The death penalty case arose Sept. 5, 1979, when Coleman raped,
sodomized and murdered Shirley Hill in San Francisco. After
convicting Coleman and hearing the judge's mistaken instruction,
the jury sentenced the defendant to death.
</P>
<P>
   The California Supreme Court upheld the penalty, but federal
courts later reversed. The 9th Circuit, upholding a decision of a
California federal court, said the judge's erroneous instruction
confused the jury by creating ``the false impression that the
governor, acting alone,'' could commute a life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   But the Supreme Court said the 9th Circuit incorrectly set aside
the death sentence ``without first determining that the error had a
substantial and injurious effect on the jury's verdict.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens led the dissenters in assailing the majority's
``ill-conceived'' decision to even grant California's appeal, let
alone rule for the state without having heard arguments in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   The dissenting justices said the 9th Circuit correctly ruled
that the judge's confusing and inaccurate statement of the
governor's authority discouraged the jury from considering a
penalty less than death. A juror said after the sentence that many
on the panel feared that, unless Coleman was condemned, a governor
could later order him paroled, the dissenters said.
</P>
<P>
   In the disability case, Georgia is appealing an 11th Circuit
decision ordering the state to treat mentally disabled residents at
home rather than in institutions if they can function outside a
hospital. The ruling was based on a Justice Department regulation
under the Americans with Disabilities Act that requires states to
administer services ``in the most integrated setting appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas, 20 other states and Guam joined a brief Florida submitted
to the justices in support of Georgia's position that neither
Congress nor the department has the constitutional authority to
decide how states should treat mentally ill residents unless the
states are violating the civil rights of these individuals. The
justices are expected to rule by July.

OH, WHAT FUN IT IS TO BUY ... GIFTS FOR EVERY RELATIVE
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by CHRISTMAS-IDEAS) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LIZ STEVENS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This year for Hanukkah, Julie Yolles is buying her
impossible-to-shop-for dad the same thing she gets him every year:
a subscription to a boating magazine. Paul Cuadros' dad is getting
a pair of khaki pants for Christmas _ whether he needs 'em or not.
And Dianna Connor will force herself to buy her sister-in-law
``something pretty,'' even though her brother's wife once gave her
an address book made out of a license plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't that lame?'' she groans.
</P>
<P>
   Gift shopping for relatives can be painful any time of year. But
when it has to be done en masse, like before the winter holidays,
buying presents can turn even uber-shoppers into whimpering mall
saps. The pressure to choose the right item at the right price in
the right size and color _ and that also sends the right message _
can be paralyzing.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, some families have developed solutions, such as
formulas for satisfying everyone's fancy _ like swapping elaborate
lists. Or just giving cash (there are ways to present it
creatively, one expert says).
</P>
<P>
   Many of us, though, still flail around helplessly. Like Cuadros,
we just take a stab in the dark. Like Yolles, we stick to
successful but predictable goodies.
</P>
<P>
   And, like Connor, we end up with unwanted stuff that gets shoved
into a corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually hate gift-giving (at Christmas), because it's
forced,'' said Connor, an editor in Santa Fe, N.M. ``You're going
out, and you have to buy 20 things in one day. How thoughtful can
you get?''
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be thoughtful in the least if Uncle Al has
supplied you with a list of all the goodies he's hankering for. The
benefit in this is obvious: no shopping angst.
</P>
<P>
   But doesn't list-making take the creativity and intimacy out of
gift-giving? There are arguments on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   The online shopping arm of QVC, iQVC, has adopted the wish-list
philosophy for its Holiday Gift Boutique, introduced in November.
Sign up on the wish list and specify everything from your clothing
sizes to favorite fragrances to specific gift choices, then send
friends and relatives your password.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lists are something consumers have been trained to create
since day one, sitting on Santa's lap and telling him what you
want,'' said an iQVC spokesperson.
</P>
<P>
   This can be a good way to satisfy picky relatives. Then again,
some list-making routines are so elaborate, it takes more time to
make the list than to actually do the shopping.
</P>
<P>
   One colleague's family shops exclusively by catalog, compiling
lists of everyone's wants, then sending copies to each household.
Each potential gift specifies which catalog it comes from, the item
number, color, size and the catalog's 800 number.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you receive a list, you decide what you are going to
`sign up for' and then you have to call all the other people in the
family and let them know what you're getting so they don't get it,
too,'' she breathlessly explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely in favor of families making wish lists, really
having fun with it,'' said Michelle Passoff, the New York-based
author of ``Lighten Up! Free Yourself From Clutter.'' ``I think
it's a good practice to know what you want and to let other people
know it. Then you don't end up with what you don't want, which ends
up as clutter.''
</P>
<P>
   Passoff encourages drawing up lists that include everything from
your simplest desires to the most extravagant _ and letting your
family use their imaginations. Ask for a trip to the French
Riviera, and you might at least get an evening of French films and
food.
</P>
<P>
   Or, instead of tangible items, think about giving
``experiences,'' Passoff added, like a night at the theater or a
baby-sitting IOU or breakfast in bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My honest feeling is that (lists) kind of take the fun out of
it,'' noted Chiquita Woodard, author of ``It's Just What I've
Always Wanted! More Than 2000 Imaginative and Unique Gifts _ From a
Ride in a MiG Jet to a Singing Telegram.'' Woodard, the former
director of merchandising for Smith &AMP; Hawken and the gift expert on
America Online for two years, divided her book into chapters for
Valentine's Day, birthdays, baby showers and, of course, the
holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   Woodard's book is filled with fresh and affordable gift ideas,
like signing up a fishing fanatic for the Fishing Lure of the Month
Club; or, for the ``woman with everything,'' making a charitable
donation in her name.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever you do, said Woodard, ``don't head out to the malls
blindly trying to find something, because you will be frustrated,
you will be stressed and you'll spend more money than you want to
spend.''

MOMENTOUS VOTE IN CONNECTICUT; DAMAGE CONTROL IN BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Connecticut lawmakers were going over the final details
of the $350 million New England Patriots stadium proposal, expected
to pass the General Assembly in a historic vote Tuesday, while
Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham sat in his Beacon Hill office
thinking one thing.
</P>
<P>
   Last rites.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would probably be the appropriate sacrament,'' Birmingham
said Monday, leaning back in a leather chair and gazing out the
window. ``It didn't have to come to this. I mean, we had negotiated
an agreement with the Patriots that would have kept them here for
25 years playing in a $200 million privately-financed stadium. And
it was a winner for all of the taxpayers in the Commonwealth,
whether they're Patriots fans or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the marble State House hall, Governor Paul Cellucci stood
in the anteroom of House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran's office,
waiting to meet with the man who many believe drove the team across
the state line by refusing to compromise on a Senate bill that
would have provided $72 million in land and improvements around
Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they have the votes,'' Cellucci said of Connecticut's
legislature, ``It's pretty much over. I feel bad for the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut officials see Tuesday's vote as fatalistic, too,
but, obviously, with a much brighter outlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now Representative (Moira) Lyons is on board and told the
caucus she will vote for the bill,'' Larry Perosino, spokesman for
Connecticut's House Democrats, said referring to the incoming
speaker of the house, who had been the deal's most vocal critic.
</P>
<P>
   Perosino said leaders expect the debate and voting on the
publicly-financed stadium to be finished by the end of Tuesday, and
ready for the signature of Governor John Rowland, who secretly
negotiated and signed a memorandum of understanding with franchise
owner Robert Kraft less than a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a core of people who are going to vote against it
and they have a right to say why they don't think it's a good
public policy and offer up amendments,'' Perosino said. ``But once
again, the speaker encouraged members that if they were thinking of
filing amendments that changed the deal in a substantial way, he
would encourage them to vote no and not put forth their
amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, referring to the reduction in the luxury seat guarantee
the state is providing Kraft, Perosino said: ``You can't negotiate
with the entire legislature. The governor has negotiated and
addressed a number of concerns...and now we're ready to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   In the original proposal, Connecticut would have guaranteed up
to $17.5 million a year in luxury seating at the open-air facility
-- a component which many lawmakers and citizens felt was too
generous.
</P>
<P>
   But over the weekend, Rowland reduced that guarantee by 25
percent _ or as much as $4 million a year -- lowering the price of
club seats and making the state responsible for a smaller
percentage of unsold premium tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft has also agreed to pay off the state's remaining bonds and
make up for the revenue the state would have made if he pulls the
team out of Connecticut before the 30-year lease expires.
</P>
<P>
   The state will pay up to $374 million for construction, which
includes site preparation and inflation. Kraft will have to pay for
additional costs.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's House of Representatives, with 96 Democrats and 55
Republicans, is expected to vote on the measure first, followed by
the 36-member Senate.
</P>
<P>
   On Beacon Hill, the damage control stretched for hours Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Birmingham, citing recent legislative approval for a convention
center and a replacement for the Boston Garden, said the Patriots
stadium ordeal here was ``aberrational.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Both were journeys that had a lot of twists and turns in the
road, but we eventually got there. This was one where we didn't.
And, in terms of atmospherics, that's not positive for
Massachusetts,'' Birmingham said. ``I regret it came to this
because it didn't have to. But I am quite confident, quite
comfortable, that we in the Senate did all that was required to
keep the team here. ... But we didn't give away the shop in the
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Birmingham said he had no reason for optimism that the team --
and their nearly $10 million in annual tax revenue -- would stay
here, given the specter of Tuesday's vote, which will bind the
Patriots and their corporate offices to move to Hartford as early
as 2001.
</P>
<P>
   However, even outside the State House, a sense of resignation
has settled in. Phone calls criticizing Beacon Hill's inaction on
the stadium issue are down to a trickle, the senate president said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``Senators have something to say when asked why
the Patriots are leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   The implication: It's Finneran's fault.
</P>
<P>
   And Cellucci, even while standing in the Speaker's office, also
blamed the House and its leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what's unfortunate is that we were very close here in
Massachusetts an unable to complete it,'' Cellucci said. ``The
House appeared to be almost unwilling to try to sit down and work
it out. It looks to me like it's too late now. ... It looks like
they have the votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Just then, Finneran appeared in the waiting room next to his
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which part of the governor's statement is inaccurate?'' he
sarcastically asked. ``The governor and I get along personally and
professionally but there's perhaps a difference of opinion and a
difference of philosophy ...''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci interrupted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do agree that we would not ask Massachusetts to put up the
kind of money that Connecticut put up,'' the governor said.
``That's something we agree on.''

DEMOCRAT DEFECTORS COULD DECIDE CLINTON'S FATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While attention has focused on moderate House
Republicans who are undecided about impeachment, a small number of
wavering Democrats could ultimately determine President Clinton's
fate.
</P>
<P>
   In a House vote later this week that many lawmakers consider too
close to call, a handful of Democratic defections could make it
more difficult for Clinton to avoid being impeached and undercut
the administration's argument that this is a partisan exercise
orchestrated by the Republican majority.
</P>
<P>
   At least three conservative Democrats have said they plan to
vote for impeachment _ Representatives Ralph M. Hall of Texas, Gene
Taylor of Mississippi and Virgil H. Goode Jr. of Virginia. That
means the White House needs at least 14 of the 228 Republicans to
vote no for impeachment to fail.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Paul McHale, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, also
said he is leaning toward voting for impeachment. He was the first
member of the president's party to call on him to resign, but
recently he had been working with House minority leader Richard A.
Gephardt on a censure resolution.
</P>
<P>
   At least five other Democrats say they are undecided. White
House and Democratic leadership aides speculated Monday that two or
three of those votes may be cast in the president's favor.
</P>
<P>
   For every Democratic vote Clinton loses, he will need the vote
of a Republican, only five of whom have publicly announced they
will support him.
</P>
<P>
   Like their Republican counterparts, fence-sitting Democrats say
they have been pummeled with calls and e-mails that are split down
the middle.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most closely watched undecided Democrats is
Representative William O. Lipinski of Illinois, who represents the
southwest side of Chicago and neighboring middle-class suburbs. As
a social conservative, he embraced more of the Republican agenda
after nearly losing his seat in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Lipinski has been a mystery for White House aides and their
allies who have dispatched Commerce Secretary William Daley, who
hails from Chicago, to talk with him. Calls have poured into
Lipinski's office at the rate of one every minute, or so it seems,
an aide said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get threats from both sides,'' said Julie Turner, a
spokeswoman from another undecided Democrat, Representative Charles
W. Stenholm of Texas. ``If you vote this way, I'll never vote for
you again. If you vote that way, I'll never vote for you again,''
she said, recalling some of the calls. ``It's surprisingly
two-sided.''
</P>
<P>
   The other three undecided Democrats are Representatives
Christopher C. John, a conservative from Louisana; Robert E.
``Bud'' Cramer of Alabama, whose district rejected Clinton for
president in 1992 and 1996; and Pat Danner of Missouri, an abortion
opponent considered the most conservative woman in the Democratic
Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   McHale, who is retiring at the end of this term, said he will
vote to impeach Clinton unless he learns new information, since the
chances the GOP will allow a censure vote on the House floor have
diminished.
</P>
<P>
   All nine Democrats were among the 31 party members who voted
with Republicans in October to launch an open-ended impeachment
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt has phoned all 31 to get a feel for where they stand.
In those conversations, he has stated his own disapproval of
Clinton's conduct for lying about his affair with a former White
House intern. But the minority leader also has suggested that the
president's offenses are not impeachable, according to his aides.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, one Democratic leadership aide said of the undecided
Democrats: ``You got to keep your eye on them.'' But this aide
quickly added optimstically: ``They will come home. They will
support the president.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, a senior official said the administration
was not discounting the damage if more than three Democrats walk
away from the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every vote counts,'' said the official, who spoke on the
condition that his name not be used. ``We're doing what we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Rozell, a political scientist with the University of
Pennsylvania, said Democratic defections are more politically
harmful to Clinton, particularly on such a historic vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly carries a lot more weight,'' he said. ``The
president and his people have made the case that this whole
endeavor is a partisan travesty. It's a little bit more difficult
to make that case credible if a significant number of Democrats
also side with the Republicans,'' Rozell said, asserting that six
or seven Democratic defections would be significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the emphasis on moderate Republicans is justified, but
they should not ignore the wavering Democrats at the same time,''
he continued. ``If so, they do so to their own peril, especially if
this comes down to a handful of votes, which it very well may.''

House, several of President Clinton's few Republican supporters
began to waver Monday. Instead of conciliation, the White House
turned to the attack with Vice President Gore denouncing
Congressional Republicans for refusing to allow a vote on censure
and asserting they were thwarting the overwhelming will of the
nation. With photo. By Alison Mitchell.

   U.S.-DEPORTATIONS (New York) _ In the two years since Congress
passed tough anti-immigration laws to stem the flow of illegal
immigration to the United States, federal authorities have deported
almost 300,000 immigrants to countries all over the world, more
than twice the number of people who were sent back in the two years
before. The unprecedented high number of deportations have been
possible because for the first time the INS has both the
congressional mandate and the financial resources to investigate
and prosecute violators of immigration law, arrest immigrants with
criminal convictions as well as would-be immigrants at the border
and swiftly deport them from the United States _ sometimes in less
than 12 hours. By Mirta Ojito.

CUBA: THE ISLAND OF THE TORTOISE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM WRIGHT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``What country has the perfect model?'' asks Foreign Minister
Roberto Robaino.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not said that ours is perfect.'' The unspoken
implication is clear: Cubans, along with many others, see the
United States as trying to remake the rest of humankind in its own
image.
</P>
<P>
   Robaino's deeper message is that Cuba is not averse to
democratic change _ at its own pace and initiative.
</P>
<P>
   That Cuba is changing, everyone agrees _ internally, through
experimental economic and political reforms; externally, in its
perceptions of the world and its own role in the family. The speed
and adequacy of Cuba's metamorphosis are what provoke the
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Government spokesmen like Robaino and National Assembly
President Ricardo Alarcon believe their country deserves credit for
steps that mark a clean break from the past. For one thing, Cuba
has abandoned military aid to subversive movements in other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't send soldiers anymore,'' says Ricardo Alarcon. ``We
send doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   He points to trained medical rescue teams that Cuba had on the
ground in places like Honduras and the Dominican Republic in the
immediate wake of Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   Fidel Castro, during our three-and-a-half-hour conversation last
month, offered to supply physicians and medical technicians without
charge _ if some other country will provide the vaccines, which
Cuba doesn't have in sufficient quantity _ to inoculate people in
Haiti, where reports say 35,000 die each year from preventable
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your country and mine could work together there, we'd
clearly save thousands of lives,'' he offers.
</P>
<P>
   Cubans are proudest of their attainments in health and
education. Theirs is an enviable 96 percent literacy rate, arguably
the best in the hemisphere. Public health standards also are high,
reflected in low disease and infant mortality statistics. Medical
treatment is free.
</P>
<P>
   The university system has educated more physicians and full
professors, in fact, than Cuba's domestic institutions need.
Efforts are afoot to export their professional skills to other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 62,000 trained physicians in Cuba today,'' boasts Dr.
Raul Gomez, head of Havana's spotlessly impressive, 952-bed modern
hospital. ``In 1959, there were only 6,500 doctors in the entire
country. All of them were in the large cities. Today we have
physicians in every rural community and several foreign
countries.''
</P>
<P>
   The hospital performs sophisticated surgery _ heart bypasses and
organ transplants. ``What we need and do not have,'' says Gomez,
``are enough medicines and up-to-date medical equipment.'' It costs
at least 40 percent more, he estimates, to secure these from
Germany and Japan than it would if Cubans were allowed by U.S. law
to buy such necessities from American manufacturers and
distributors.
</P>
<P>
   Several welcome political changes have come upon the scene in
the last few years. One is the Cuban government's treatment of
religion. Once an avowed ``atheist state,'' Cuba now has a
constitutional amendment granting religious freedom. This repealed
bans on various types of public religious activity.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas, discontinued as an official national holiday in 1969
on the ground that it interfered with the sugar harvest, was
formally reinstated last year by Castro. That one-time action now
is being made permanent.
</P>
<P>
   Castro himself seems profoundly moved by his personal visits
with Pope John Paul II. To several of us at dinner, the old
revolutionary volunteered repeated exclamations of admiration for
the pontiff's ``intellect, integrity and understanding of the human
condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Today there are notably fewer political prisoners, some greater
freedom of expression, and easier access for foreign media. The
government has welcomed the establishment of permanent Havana
bureaus for CNN and The Associated Press. In October, Castro hosted
U.S newspaper editors and publishers, answering their questions at
length.
</P>
<P>
   The Republic of Cuba is not a democracy by official U.S.
definition. It holds regular, constitutionally mandated elections
but within a one-party system that features town-hall nominating
procedures. Castro heads both the party and the Council of State.
</P>
<P>
   Our U.S. chief of mission, Michael Kozak, calls it a
``top-down'' political structure with inadequate power
diversification and human rights guarantees. Cuban leaders respond
that, whatever their imperfections, they are moving toward a more
open society and that the U.S. pursues cordial relations with
China, Vietnam, Saudi Arabia, Arab emirates and other countries
that Kozak's description would fit equally well.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba's Popular Assembly, or national legislature, convenes in
two brief sessions annually. A product of the new Constitution, the
legislative branch is only evolving as an instrument of national
power. Currently, it's wrestling with laws to disperse more
authority to state and municipal governments.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly President Ricardo Alarcon is a careful student of the
U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
   He plies California Rep. Estaban Torres and me with probing
questions. That day he wanted to know how soon a printed copy of
the latest omnibus appropriations bill would be available. He was
anxious to scour it for any publicly unreported riders that might
affect his country.
</P>
<P>
   Alarcon, 60, easily could be mistaken for an American. His
English is excellent, as is his sense of humor. He laughs now about
several embarrassing inconveniences during the years when he was
his country's ambassador to the United Nations. Alone among their
peers from around the world, Cuba's diplomats were prohibited by
U.S. law from going any farther than 25 miles in any direction from
the U.N. headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Alarcon is a realist. He makes no claims of Cuban political
purity.
</P>
<P>
   The country has ``no deeply established legislative
traditions,'' he volunteers. ``We'd like to move carefully so as to
avoid all the pitfalls we can.''

SMITHONIAN CLOSES ART RECORDS OFFICES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By M.R. MONTGOMERY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A minor Boston outpost of the Smithsonian Institution
disappeared last month. Almost no one noticed, but those who did
are variously disappointed, outraged, and discouraged.
</P>
<P>
   It was, until just before Thanksgiving, the 28-year-old Boston
office of the Archives of American Art, a one-man operation on
Beacon Hill. The Archives survives, but all its regional offices
were closed on Nov. 23 in a budget decision that irritated and
flabbergasted its local advisory committee.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Master-Karnik, a committee member, called ``vital'' the
archive's task of collecting the papers and business records of
artists and galleries and museums. Those that it doesn't collect,
it microfilms for the convenience of scholars.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the now-unemployed archivist in the Boston office,
Master-Karnik added that ``what Bob Brown did was essential to
collecting, he knew everybody, he stayed in touch with everyone. He
did enormous work with ... papers that are critical to scholars and
museums.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who was surprised, if not stunned, by the closing of his
office and the end of nearly 30 years of employment by the
Smithsonian, said last week that the great shame was not merely
closing his office, but abandoning the concept of collecting
records and materials nationally. ``There was not a serious attempt
to raise money'' to continue the work of the regional offices, he
said. ``There was never an explicit appeal. In fact, I was never
hired to do fund-raising; I was told explicitly that `fund-raising
is not in your picture.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara de Marneffe, former chair of the New England advisory
committee and now a trustee of the Archives of American Art,
acknowledged that there had been rumors and hints that the regional
offices would be closed, but still, when the word came in
September, it was a shock. ``There wasn't any question of keeping
the office open,'' she recalled, ``and when officials came up from
Washington it wasn't to discuss the decision, it was just to
explain it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Smithsonian couldn't continue to fund it,'' de Marneffe
added, ``at least they could back us in fund-raising. We're hoping
to raise private funds; we're going to notify the New England
congressional delegation. Taking a full-time collector away from
New England is very, very shortsighted.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan now is to send out collecting teams from the
Smithsonian headquarters when a gallery closes or an artist's
papers become available. ``That just doesn't work,'' according to
Sinclair Hitchings, curator of prints at the Boston Public Library
and another member of the advisory committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The returns from Bob Brown's collecting have been fabulous.
He's got a retentive memory and a network of friends and contacts.
As for the officials at the Smithsonian,'' Hitchings added, ``they
are defiantly wrongheaded.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, ``defiantly'' is an adverb that applies to many actions
since the closing was announced. Relations between the director of
the archives, Richard J. Wattenmaker, and his Boston committee,
couldn't be more defiant. Concluding a written response to
complaints from staff at the Museum of Fine Arts, Wattenmaker noted
that the Boston committee hadn't raised any serious money since the
1970s, and had no authority to tell him how to run his department.
In a letter in The New York Times, he asked rhetorically: ``When
the Museum of Fine Arts put up that ugly shopping mall wing, did I
call them up and say, `Why are you putting all this trash in the
museum?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Wattenmaker's final thought on the matter, referring to
criticism from two curators at the MFA, Jonathan L. Fairbanks and
Theodore Stebbins, was simple: ``How about they run their business,
and the Smithsonian runs its business?''
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been,'' the BPL's Hitchings remarked, ``some
gratuitous nastiness.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown is looking for a job, and Hitchings and a few others are
hoping that some arrangement can be made not only to keep him
employed, but to keep the paper and microfilm flowing to
Washington. But no one is very hopeful. The problem, Hitchings
concluded, was that those people in Washington didn't understand
the rest of the country.

LAWYERS SUING BIG TOBACCO COLLECTING BILLIONS IN FEES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Fla., Minn., Miss., Texas)  (rl) 
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few months ago, Patrick Coughlin, a San Diego lawyer involved
in a lawsuit against R.J. Reynolds, was thinking of asking for a
$50 million fee for his firm, a sum that might strike some people
as high for a case that the cigarette maker had settled for $10
million.
</P>
<P>
   Then Coughlin heard that the five lawyers who represented Texas
in its $17.3 billion settlement with tobacco companies this year
planned to shoot for the moon before the arbitrators who were to
determine both their fees and his. Alarm bells went off and within
weeks, Coughlin's fee request had shot up like a fever _ to $650
million. The Texas group, after all, was seeking $25 billion, and
the pot of money for lawyers was limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rightly or wrongly,'' Coughlin acknowledged, ``I decided to
ask for hundreds of millions of dollars so that I won't be crushed
by the amounts other people were asking for.''
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary requests for payment by the Texas lawyers and
Coughlin's firm are likely to become commonplace as plaintiffs'
lawyers across the country grab for fees from smoking-related
settlements between the tobacco industry and the states.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlements, all lawyers will eventually receive the
full amount of whatever fees they are awarded. But because the
industry's payments of legal fees are limited to $500 million a
year, those who win the biggest fees first will be paid long before
lawyers with smaller, later awards.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, what may distinguish Coughlin is not how much he
requested, but his openness about the gamesmanship behind the
stratospheric numbers as the lawyers fight for their share of what
could total $20 billion or more in legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit against the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., known as the
Mangini suit because it was originally filed by a San Francisco
lawyer, Janet Mangini, attacked the company's Joe Camel marketing
campaign for aiming at teen-agers. In settling for $10 million,
R.J. Reynolds, the tobacco division of RJR Nabisco, acknowledged
that the suit played a significant role in its decision to drop the
campaign. Industry documents that Coughlin and his colleagues
helped uncover had shown that cigarette makers viewed teen-agers as
young as 14 as ``replacement'' smokers.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to get a big slice of the fee pie, Coughlin's firm,
Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes &AMP; Lerach, gave arbitrators studies that
claimed their work in helping to get rid of Joe Camel was worth
$650 million. The reason: without the cartoon pitchman, a million
fewer teen-agers would take up smoking over the next 25 years,
saving society $60 billion in health care and other costs.
</P>
<P>
   The law firm also developed a slick newsmagazine-style video,
``Breaking the Camel's Back,'' that extolled its work in exposing
Big Tobacco's ``biggest secrets'' and ``deadliest lies.'' It also
offered the arbitration panel testimonials about the case's impact
from anti-smoking advocates like Dr. David Kessler, former
commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the amount of legal fees awarded, the final bill
paid by tobacco companies and smokers could grow by billions. The
Texas lawyers, for example, were awarded $3.3 billion by
arbitrators last week, some $1 billion more than they would have
received under their original contract with the state. One member
of the three-member arbitration panel was chosen by the tobacco
companies, another by the plaintiffs' lawyers and the third by
common consent.
</P>
<P>
   Some plaintiffs' lawyers who sued tobacco companies on behalf of
states said they were outraged by the fees sought by their
colleagues in the first round of arbitrations and were stunned by
the actual awards announced last week. Lawyers who represented
Texas, Florida and Mississippi, the first three states to settle
suits brought against the tobacco industry to recover health-care
costs, were awarded $8.2 billion in fees.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``The awards are far in excess of these lawyers' contribution to
any of the state results,'' said Michael Ciresi, a plaintiffs'
lawyer in Minneapolis who represented Minnesota and a health
insurer in a $6.5 billion settlement with tobacco companies, which
are paying his firm and others fees equal to 7.1 percent of that
amount. ``It's terrible, the public is going to take the wrong
message away from this.''
</P>
<P>
   Ciresi and others say the case involving Coughlin's firm played
a significant role in litigation against cigarette makers. ``They
did do valuable work,'' Ciresi said. ``But in my judgment they
didn't do $650 million of value. The rule of reason has to apply.''
</P>
<P>
   Kessler, who is now dean of the Yale University Medical School,
said he was glad to share his opinion when approached by lawyers
from Coughlin's firm because he believed that the lawsuit had
helped expose the industry's targeting of youth.
</P>
<P>
   But Kessler said he never asked about the size of the lawyers'
fee request. Nor had the lawyers volunteered the information. ``I
think they did a real service, but I think the fee is outrageous,''
he said in a telephone interview last week before the arbitrators'
decision became public. ``All the legal fees are out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas lawyers, like Coughlin's firm, recalculated the value
of their state's settlement for arbitrators. While Texas' $17.3
billion settlement with cigarette makers was projected over 25
years, the lawyers submitted a study by a Yale University professor
predicting that over the next 50 years, Texas would receive $100
billion from tobacco companies under the deal. As a result, the
lawyers claimed they were due $25 billion.
</P>
<P>
   They got $3.3 billion. But Coughlin was awakened Friday at 5
a.m. and greeted with the disappointing news that his team would
get only $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Coughlin's case was unique. Though not a state
action, it had been made part of the fee arbitration process for
state settlements under an agreement between R.J. Reynolds and his
firm. But while the tobacco companies had agreed not to argue
against fee requests from Texas, Florida and Mississippi lawyers,
they bitterly opposed Coughlin.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of lawyers hired by the 46 states and five territories
involved in the recent $206 billion tobacco settlement plan will
face similar battles as they seek to become multimillionaires or
even billionaires. Many of their fees will be determined by the
same arbitration process that resulted in Friday's awards, and some
lawyers represented dozens of states.
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin appears inclined to agree that the fee requests are
outsized, but he says that's the nature of the game as lawyers try
to secure the largest possible slice of the annual $500 million in
fees, slices that will grow thinner each year as arbitrators make
more awards.
</P>
<P>
   At a fee hearing at a Manhattan hotel 10 days ago, Coughlin said
he realized that his award would be ``crushed'' in the annual
payout by the billions sought by the state lawyers from Texas and
elsewhere unless it was between $150 million and $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't happen. The $8 million his firm did receive is
one-tenth of 1 percent of the fees awarded last week, and so it
will collect less than $1 million this year from the industry's
annual pool, and much less each year thereafter as arbitrators
award more fees. But the firm will soon get another chance at the
ring.
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin's firm also helped represent one of the biggest prizes
in the recent $206 billion settlement: cities and counties in
California, which, along with the state, will get $25 billion over
25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawyers hired by states have chosen to resolve their fee
claims through direct negotiation with the tobacco industry. But
after seeing the $8.2 billion in fees given out Friday, Coughlin
says there is no question about what he will do with his California
claim, despite his recent setback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going back to arbitration, wouldn't you,'' he said. ``I'd
have to be crazy not to do it.''

 &HT;    Reeves expected back for playoffs after bypass surgery
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Atlanta Falcons coach Dan Reeves is expected be moved from
intensive care to a private room today at Piedmont Hospital, where
he is recovering from four hours of quadruple-bypass surgery Monday
to relieve blockages in three heart arteries.
</P>
<P>
   The 54-year-old Reeves, a leading candidate for NFL coach of the
year honors for guiding the Falcons (12-2) to first place in the
NFC West, had angioplasty procedures in 1990 and 1991 to clear
blockages.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves is expected to be back on the sideline for the playoffs
and could talk with his assistants as early as today. He will not
make the trip to Detroit on Sunday for a game that could clinch the
team's second division title in 33 years.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant head coach and defensive coordinator Rich Brooks will
be the interim head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Harrison, one of the team's physicians and one of the
doctors who diagnosed the blockages Monday morning, said the
location and nature of Reeves' blockages called for bypass surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Cardiac surgeon James Kauten bypassed one artery that appeared
to be completely blocked and two others that were more than 80
percent blocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Statistically, he has a 99 percent or better chance of doing
fine,'' Kauten said.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison said that, because Reeves suffered no damage to his
heart muscle, the coach could go back to work on a part-time basis
as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing Dan Reeves, I suspect we'll be able to discharge him
Friday,'' Harrison said. ``He did not have a heart attack. He has
never had a heart attack. We've got wonderful, viable heart muscle
to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   ``For this reason ... I would not be surprised see Dan
participating in some game-planning for the Dolphins (on Dec. 27).
Whether he'll be on the field, I can't say. But I see no reason ...
why he couldn't be back for the playoffs (which begin for wild-card
teams on Jan. 2) and the Super Bowl, which I say with confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Players and coaches reacted with disbelief and reservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came in to work this morning, and nobody knew anything
about it,'' 12-year veteran linebacker Cornelius Bennett said. ``We
know what kind of ship coach Reeves runs, and Rich is going to do
his thing. But it's up to us as veterans to hold this team together
and keep the boat afloat.''
</P>
<P>
   Rookie wide receiver Tim Dwight said: ``It just takes it right
out of you. One moment, you see the guy on the sideline all happy
after a game, and the next thing you know he's in the hospital
fighting for his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him on the plane (Sunday) night, and he didn't look too
good. He was talking to the Doc, and I thought maybe he was sick or
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, 57, was head coach of the St. Louis Rams in 1995-96
after serving as head coach at the University of Oregon for 17
years.
</P>
<P>
   He will remain in the coaches' box above the field to call the
defenses. While he won't get involved in offensive play-calling, he
said he would be involved in critical decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterbacks coach Jack Burns called plays from the coaches' box
down to Reeves, who wore a headset on the sideline and sent them
via radio headset to quarterback Chris Chandler. Now, Burns will
relay plays to running backs coach George Sefcik, who will radio
them to Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan obviously has changed some of those (plays called by
Burns),'' Brooks said. ``I'll have a switch on the headset upstairs
where I can listen in to the offense. (He, Burns and Sefcik) will
talk about different situations, (whether to) run or pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be involved just situationally, not that I want to run
the off-tackle play or throw deep. (I'll be involved in)
fourth-and-one, whether to go for it, kick a field goal, those
types of situations.''
</P>
<P>
   No other coaching responsibilities have changed, pending further
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves first told Harrison that he had been experiencing chest
pain and a burning sensation in his throat after Sunday's 27-17
victory at New Orleans. That victory tied the team record for
victories in a season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan summoned me into the corner of the locker room after the
game ... and said, 'I'm probably overreacting, ... but I just want
to tell you I'm having a burning sensation in my chest like I did
in 1990, and I've had it for several weeks,' `` Harrison said.
``What do you think we ought to do?''
</P>
<P>
   Harrison gave Reeves two aspirin on the plane to thin his blood
and recommended that the coach undergo a heart catheterization
Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that the blockage in the circumflex artery probably
was causing the burning sensation in Reeves' chest and that if it
closed all the way, the result would have been, in Harrison's
words, ``a catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves, whose regular-season career record of 160-117-1 ranks
him eighth on the NFL's all-time victory list, is a native of
Americus. He played at the University of South Carolina before
joining the Dallas Cowboys in 1965 as an undrafted free-agent
running back.
</P>
<P>
   He played running back for seven years and then coached nine
years for the Dallas Cowboys under Tom Landry. He became the
Broncos head coach in 1981, leading Denver to Super Bowls after the
1986, '87 and '89 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   He was fired after an 8-8 season in 1992 and coached the New
York Giants from1993-96. When the Giants went 11-5 his first year,
he was named NFL coach of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants fired him after a 6-10 season in '96, when Reeves
repeatedly butted heads with the front office on issues of control.
</P>
<P>
   When the Falcons hired him in January 1997, he was given the
title of executive vice president of football operations. After a
1-7 start last year, the team has won 18 of 22 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of coach Reeves' greatest strengths is the organization he
has put together,'' Falcons president Taylor Smith said. ``He feels
as I do that we have the type of players and coaches ... to move
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, meanwhile, said the team has no choice but to march on.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about a guy who has meant everything to this
organization,'' he said. ``What Dan has done is just unbelievable
... a remarkable turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to,'' Brooks said, pausing, ``pick up the slack and
make it easy on him during his recovery. I know Dan. He's going to
feel a lot better about getting well if we take care of business.''

MOMENTOUS VOTE IN CONNECTICUT; DAMAGE CONTROL IN BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>

 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Connecticut lawmakers were going over the final details
of the $350 million New England Patriots stadium proposal, expected
to pass the General Assembly in a historic vote Tuesday, while
Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham sat in his Beacon Hill office
thinking one thing.
</P>
<P>
   Last rites.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would probably be the appropriate sacrament,'' Birmingham
said Monday, leaning back in a leather chair and gazing out the
window. ``It didn't have to come to this. I mean, we had negotiated
an agreement with the Patriots that would have kept them here for
25 years playing in a $200 million privately-financed stadium. And
it was a winner for all of the taxpayers in the Commonwealth,
whether they're Patriots fans or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the marble State House hall, Governor Paul Cellucci stood
in the anteroom of House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran's office,
waiting to meet with the man who many believe drove the team across
the state line by refusing to compromise on a Senate bill that
would have provided $72 million in land and improvements around
Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they have the votes,'' Cellucci said of Connecticut's
legislature, ``It's pretty much over. I feel bad for the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut officials see Tuesday's vote as fatalistic, too,
but, obviously, with a much brighter outlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now Representative (Moira) Lyons is on board and told the
caucus she will vote for the bill,'' Larry Perosino, spokesman for
Connecticut's House Democrats, said referring to the incoming
speaker of the house, who had been the deal's most vocal critic.
</P>
<P>
   Perosino said leaders expect the debate and voting on the
publicly-financed stadium to be finished by the end of Tuesday, and
ready for the signature of Governor John Rowland, who secretly
negotiated and signed a memorandum of understanding with franchise
owner Robert Kraft less than a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a core of people who are going to vote against it
and they have a right to say why they don't think it's a good
public policy and offer up amendments,'' Perosino said. ``But once
again, the speaker encouraged members that if they were thinking of
filing amendments that changed the deal in a substantial way, he
would encourage them to vote no and not put forth their
amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, referring to the reduction in the luxury seat guarantee
the state is providing Kraft, Perosino said: ``You can't negotiate
with the entire legislature. The governor has negotiated and
addressed a number of concerns...and now we're ready to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   In the original proposal, Connecticut would have guaranteed up
to $17.5 million a year in luxury seating at the open-air facility
-- a component which many lawmakers and citizens felt was too
generous.
</P>
<P>
   But over the weekend, Rowland reduced that guarantee by 25
percent _ or as much as $4 million a year -- lowering the price of
club seats and making the state responsible for a smaller
percentage of unsold premium tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft has also agreed to pay off the state's remaining bonds and
make up for the revenue the state would have made if he pulls the
team out of Connecticut before the 30-year lease expires.
</P>
<P>
   The state will pay up to $374 million for construction, which
includes site preparation and inflation. Kraft will have to pay for
additional costs.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's House of Representatives, with 96 Democrats and 55
Republicans, is expected to vote on the measure first, followed by
the 36-member Senate.
</P>
<P>
   On Beacon Hill, the damage control stretched for hours Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Birmingham, citing recent legislative approval for a convention
center and a replacement for the Boston Garden, said the Patriots
stadium ordeal here was ``aberrational.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Both were journeys that had a lot of twists and turns in the
road, but we eventually got there. This was one where we didn't.
And, in terms of atmospherics, that's not positive for
Massachusetts,'' Birmingham said. ``I regret it came to this
because it didn't have to. But I am quite confident, quite
comfortable, that we in the Senate did all that was required to
keep the team here. ... But we didn't give away the shop in the
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Birmingham said he had no reason for optimism that the team --
and their nearly $10 million in annual tax revenue -- would stay
here, given the specter of Tuesday's vote, which will bind the
Patriots and their corporate offices to move to Hartford as early
as 2001.
</P>
<P>
   However, even outside the State House, a sense of resignation
has settled in. Phone calls criticizing Beacon Hill's inaction on
the stadium issue are down to a trickle, the senate president said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``Senators have something to say when asked why
the Patriots are leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   The implication: It's Finneran's fault.
</P>
<P>
   And Cellucci, even while standing in the Speaker's office, also
blamed the House and its leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what's unfortunate is that we were very close here in
Massachusetts an unable to complete it,'' Cellucci said. ``The
House appeared to be almost unwilling to try to sit down and work
it out. It looks to me like it's too late now. ... It looks like
they have the votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Just then, Finneran appeared in the waiting room next to his
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which part of the governor's statement is inaccurate?'' he
sarcastically asked. ``The governor and I get along personally and
professionally but there's perhaps a difference of opinion and a
difference of philosophy ...''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci interrupted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do agree that we would not ask Massachusetts to put up the
kind of money that Connecticut put up,'' the governor said.
``That's something we agree on.''

NEW DRUG MAY AID IN BREAST CANCER TREATMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NICOLE FOY  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ A promising, yet preliminary, new drug appears to
bypass the resistance women with breast cancer inevitably build up
to existing treatments, one of the nation's top breast cancer
researchers said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The drug Faslodex also seems to work better and longer in the
fight against breast cancer than the widely used drug tamoxifen,
said Dr. C. Kent Osborne, chief of medical oncology at the
University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne, who is also director of the Breast Cancer Program at
the San Antonio Cancer Institute, said Faslodex could prove more
powerful than tamoxifen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tumors are smart guys,'' he said. ``They tend to have the
ability to eventually develop resistance to almost any therapy. But
I'm optimistic about Faslodex because it seems to be much more
potent.''
</P>
<P>
   The drug remains in development and is being used in clinical
trials in the United States and Europe. A small, preliminary study
indicated Faslodex cured cancerous tumors in mice.
</P>
<P>
   Whether such results translate to humans remains to be seen, but
Osborne said he was excited about the odds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe if we can't get cures from it, we can at least get much
more prolonged control over the disease,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne spoke to colleagues during an international breast
cancer symposium that ends Tuesday. The San Antonio Breast Cancer
symposium, an annual event, has attracted about 2,550 researchers
and physicians.
</P>
<P>
   The symposium marks one of the largest _ if not the largest _
gatherings of breast cancer investigators anywhere in the world,
organizers said.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne will join the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Tamoxifen has been used for decades as a first-line treatment
against breast cancer. But many patients become resistant to the
drug and doctors then turn to second-line, anti-estrogen drugs such
as anastrozole, sold under the brand name Arimidex.
</P>
<P>
   Faslodex, manufactured by the Zeneca Group of Britain, would
provide yet another alternative once women become resistant to
tamoxifen. A clinical trial a few years ago in the United Kingdom
showed that 60 percent of patients responded to Faslodex after they
no longer responded to tamoxifen, Osborne said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've shown that when the tumor becomes resistant to
tamoxifen, you can make it respond again and shrink again by using
Faslodex,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The current, ongoing trials now are comparing Arimidex and
Faslodex when used after tamoxifen treatments.
</P>
<P>
   To unlock the mystery of tamoxifen resistance, researchers hope
to pinpoint why the drug, after it is administered for a while,
begins actually to stimulate _ rather than suppress _ tumors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tamoxifen is this funny drug. It has these dual activities,''
Osborne said.
</P>
<P>
   Faslodex could be the critical link to bypassing resistance and
thereby outsmarting tumor growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faslodex could be the answer to this,'' he said. ``Maybe if it
winds up being effective in people, and we wind up using it after
surgery like we've used tamoxifen ... that will be very
effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Osborne also indicated that a type of intermittent therapy
approach against breast cancer appears to be effective in some
patients who build up drug resistance. Although no scientific
evidence exists regarding the process, Osborne said he has used it
on a few patients and has had some success.
</P>
<P>
   One of Osborne's patients, for example, became resistant to
tamoxifen. After using other treatments, Osborne returned to
tamoxifen a second time to try and ``trick'' the tumor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something that doctors try a lot,'' he acknowledged.
``But with the appropriate patient, it's worth a try.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the approach has worked could indicate resistance
is not a permanent state, Osborne said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an important thing,'' he said. ``That tells us that
it's not so much a change in the genetics of the tumor, but it's
more of an adaptive thing that the tumor does and that process can
go away ... if you stop the drug.''

N. KOREANS MAY ALLOW INSPECTIONS IN EXCHANGE FOR FOOD
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ North Korea has dropped a demand that the United
States pay hundreds of millions of dollars for the right to inspect
a huge underground center that American intelligence agencies had
feared would be used to make nuclear weapons, according to senior
Clinton administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   In meetings with State Department officials in New York and
Washington this month, they said, the North Koreans suggested that
they would be willing to allow the United States to inspect the
center in exchange for food to ease the famine that has plagued
North Korea for years.
</P>
<P>
   American officials welcomed the new North Korean negotiating
stance _ both because it could salvage a 4-year-old agreement
intended to shut down North Korea's nuclear weapons program, and
because it suggested that North Korea had not yet begun building a
nuclear reactor at the site.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, they said, the North Koreans had demanded a payment of
$300 million in exchange for the inspection _ a demand quickly
rejected by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is that they have agreed in principle to allow
access to the site, which suggests that there probably isn't
anything there,'' a senior administration official said. ``It also
indicates that whatever plans they had for this facility have been
scrapped.''
</P>
<P>
   Another senior official, also speaking on condition of
anonymity, said: ``We seem to be in a problem-solving mode. We're
still apart, but there seem to be real negotiations going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials had insisted that the United States
would never make a cash payment for the right to inspect the
underground center, which is being built 25 miles from the North
Korean nuclear complex at Yongbyon.
</P>
<P>
   But they said Monday that it would be easier to justify
additional food and other relief aid, especially given recent
reports of widespread starvation in North Korea. The United States
has already provided North Korea with 500,000 metric tons of food
this year
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot pay them for access to the site,'' an administration
official involved with the issue said. ``But obviously we've
provided them with humanitarian aid in the past for humanitarian
reasons, and we might be willing to do that again.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department refused to confirm that the North Koreans
had dropped the cash demand for inspection of the site.
</P>
<P>
   But department spokesman James Foley acknowledged that ``some
progress had been made'' in the recent talks between American and
North Korean negotiators. ``Important gaps remain,'' he said,
adding that further meetings would be held ``as soon as possible to
try to close those gaps.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials denied news reports in South Korea that
a deal to allow American inspection of the construction site had
already been reached between the United States and North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Aerial photographs taken earlier this year on behalf of American
intelligence agencies showed that thousands of laborers were at
work on the huge underground plant. The discovery led to fears that
North Korea had decided to revive its nuclear weapons program at
the site in violation of a 1994 agreement with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   American officials announced progress Monday with North Korea on
another issue: the search for the remains of American troops
missing there since the Korean War. The Defense Department said the
United States and North Korea had agreed to expand joint searches
in the North next year for the remains.

LARGEST TOYMAKER MATTEL BUYS SOFTWARE MAKER LEARNING CO. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The world's largest toymaker is buying itself a $3.2 billion
Christmas present _ Learning Co., the second-largest maker of
personal computer software for the home.
</P>
<P>
   If shareholders of both companies approve the deal, it will
instantly establish Mattel as a major force in the software
industry. The addition of Learning Co., a Cambridge, Mass. company
that markets popular titles such as ``Carmen Sandiego'' and
``Myst'', could also help revitalize the House of Barbie, which
finds itself struggling in its traditional business segments.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel chairman Jill Barad prefaced her announcement of the
Learning Co. deal with news that Mattel's profit would fall short
of analysts' expectations this year and next.
</P>
<P>
   The news sent Mattel stock plunging $8 1/8 to $22 Monday, while
Learning Co. stock sank $3 5/16 to $25. Both firms trade on the New
York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news may have soured the announcement of the Learning
Co. acquisition and it may have reduced the deal's value to
Learning Co. shareholders. Mattel, based in El Segundo, Calif.,
agreed to a one-to-one stock swap with Learning Co., with an extra
two-tenths of a Mattel share if the giant toy maker's stock price
falls below $27.50.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel and Learning Co. said the deal was worth $3.8 billion
based on Friday's share prices, but the value dwindled to $3.2
billion by the end of trading Monday. The final price will be based
on the average price of Mattel stock over a 20-day period.
</P>
<P>
   The buyout could deal a blow to the work force and presence of
the Learning Co. in Massachusetts, one of the state's largest and
most well-known software companies.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Learning Co.'s software development operations are
in California. About a third of the company's 990 employees are
based in Massachusetts, and they mainly perform administrative and
customer service functions. While Learning Co. president Kevin
O'Leary and chairman Michael Perik have both signed contracts to
continue with the company, it's not yet clear how other positions
will be affected.
</P>
<P>
   Barad made it clear that Mattel is planning significant cost
cuts to bolster its bottom line. Mattel spokesman Glenn Bozarth
said that Mattel was eager to keep the Learning Co.'s experts in
educational and entertainment software, but confirmed that there
might be job cuts in administrative areas _ exactly those functions
concentrated in the Bay State.
</P>
<P>
   Learning Co., formerly known as SoftKey International Inc.,
transformed itself into the nation's largest maker of educational
software through a string of acquisitions. The expansion over the
last four years was engineered by O'Leary and Perik, a pair of
aggressive Canadian-born entrepreneurs. Three months ago, Learning
Co. purchased Broderbund Software Inc., acquiring the Carmen
Sandiego and other well-known product lines.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Learning Co. is on the other side of the acquisition table.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel's financial woes illustrate its reasons for acquiring the
software giant. Learning Co. has built up a portfolio of popular
and well-known software titles, including ``Reader Rabbit'' and
``Carmen Sandiego'' educational software as well as the
best-selling games ``Myst'' and ``Riven.''
</P>
<P>
   Learning Co. president O'Leary said that the deal will give
Mattel instant credibility in the education and entertainment
software market, a market which boasted 1997 sales of $1.8 billion
and is expected to grow rapidly thanks to surging sales of cheap
home computers. ``There's a tremendous synergy across these two
companies,'' said O'Leary. ``We're beginning to see that the toy
industry and the educational software industry are almost morphing
together.''
</P>
<P>
   James McNeal, professor of marketing at Texas A&AMP;M University,
says that Mattel's traditional toys are losing their appeal to
parents, who want Junior to learn as he plays. ``Play items had
better have learning value,'' McNeal said. The Learning Co. will
bring popular educational software into the Mattel stable, and help
Mattel create educational programs based on its own established
brands like Barbie and Hot Wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mattel is finding it harder to sell its established
toys, such as Barbie dolls, through traditional retail outlets.
Barad said that the company's unexpectedly weak numbers were caused
when major toy stores failed to place their traditional restocking
orders the week after Thanksgiving Day. Retailers, she said, are
trying to keep their own inventories as lean as possible, and are
willing to run out of popular items rather than be stuck with
unsold toys.
</P>
<P>
   Barad vowed to reduce her firm's reliance on retail sales. She
said that the acquisition of the Learning Co. is part of that
strategy, along with the purchase in July of the Pleasant Co.,
makers of the popular American Girl doll line. Learning Co. sells
about 14 percent of its products directly to schools and consumers,
while Pleasant Co. sells most of its products through catalogs.
Mattel's eventual goal is to use the expertise of these companies
to move a growing percentage of its annual sales away from
retailers, and toward catalogs and the Internet. In particular,
Barad said the Learning Co. acquisition ``will accelerate our
efforts to take our own brands into the interactive space.''

 &HT;    CLINTON VISIT HERALDS NEW U.S.-PALESTINIAN RELATIONSHIP
 &HT;    With MIDEAST-CLINTON-1215.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAZA CITY, The Gaza Strip _ Eager to show the new relations
between the PLO and the United States, Palestinian Legislator Hatem
Eid raised his voice in a crowded seaside fish restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have good relations with the U.S. Embassy,'' said the wiry
former inmate of Israeli jails, ``We also have good contact with
the CIA!''
</P>
<P>
   For a PLO activist to brag publicly about contact with the grand
agent of imperialism seemed unthinkable just a few years ago. The
PLO resented the United States, and the United States vilified the
PLO as hijackers and terrorists. But Monday in Gaza, the new
relationship between the United States and the PLO was confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   In the first visit of a U.S. president to Palestinian-controlled
territory, President Bill Clinton not only spent a day in Gaza but
addressed several hundred PLO activists.
</P>
<P>
   Many were former guerrillas, who fought in Lebanon or as street
activists in the Intifada uprising. Hundreds spent time in Israeli
jails.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that in 1979, then-U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations Andrew Young lost his job because he met with PLO
representatives without telling his boss, then-President Jimmy
Carter.
</P>
<P>
   The cliche in the streets of Gaza Monday, from the
heavily-patrolled avenues to the sandy alleys of the refugee camps,
was that this was the first time you saw U.S. flags in Gaza when
they were not in flames.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S.-Palestinian relationship, at times encouraged and
at times detested by Israelis, has developed over the years. There
were secret talks going back to the 1970s. In 1988, the U.S.
coached Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, long considered a
dangerous man, on how to officially recognize Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis point out that, when former Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin shook Arafat's hand in 1993, it cleared the way for Americans
to get closer to him. Arafat, the former terrorist now has a Nobel
Peace Prize and is seen as key to keeping the Palestinians on a
moderate path.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the CIA has trained Arafat's security forces.
Since 1994, the United States has given $75 million in economic aid
to the incipient Palestinian government.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton caused a stir
when, speaking to a group of Israeli and Arab youth, she said it
would be appropriate for the Palestinians to have some sort of
state.
</P>
<P>
   Those comments, though disavowed by the White House, were not
lost on Palestinians or their children. Hundreds of them waved
flags and lined the roads of a refugee camp to give an enthusiastic
greeting to the first lady on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians still feel that President Clinton's administration
favors Israel, but they see a change coming. Clinton lavished
praise on the activists gathered Monday, thanking them for dropping
their call for Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very, very, different situation and we feel we are
going to get our rights,'' said Khaled Musmar, who ran the Voice of
the Palestinian Revolution radio station in Lebanon in the early
1980s. He was among several PLO officials watching with intensely
as a hotel television showed Clinton arriving in Gaza by
helicopter.

NATIONAL GRID LOOKING TO MORE US ACQUISITIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ National Grid Group Plc is expected to use New England
Electric System as a beachhead to acquire more US electric
utilities as states begin to open their markets to competition,
officials of the British company said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to develop a strong busines here in the northeast with
the goal of expanding into other parts of the United States that
undergo deregulation,'' said David G. Jefferies chairman of
National Grid, which runs the electricity transmission network in
England and Wales. ``Naturally there may be other opportunities and
NEES would be the natural platform.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston Monday, Jefferies and Alfred D. Houston, New England
Electric System's chairman, formally announced that National Grid
is offering to buy New England Electric for $3.2 billion in cash.
The deal, signed late Sunday, values New England Electric shares at
$53.75 apiece, a 25 percent premium over Friday's closing price of
$43 a share.
</P>
<P>
   However, news of the deal prompted the Westborough, Mass.
utility's shares to soar 5 1/4 points to close at 48 1/4, reducing
the acquisition premium to 11.4 percent. National Grid said it will
also assume $1.4 billion of long-term debt. National Grid's shares
fell 10.5 pence to 488 pence on the London stock market.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is the latest scramble among major foreign utility
companies to enter the US market, which is undergoing a rocky
transition toward open competition after nearly 100 years of
monopolistic practices. Last week ScottishPower Plc said it would
take over PacifiCorp, an Oregon utility, for $7.9 billion. National
Grid's purchase also follows a deal by BEC Energy, parent company
of Boston Edison, to pay $950 million for Commonwealth Energy
System of Cambridge, Mass., creating the largest Massachusetts
utility with nearly 1.3 million customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is increasing pressure on nearly any utility trying to
survive on a stand alone basis,'' said James F. Calllahan, a
partner at Arthur Andersen LLP in Boston and director of its New
England energy practice. ``Companies that come in, like National
Grid, are looking to improve efficiencies, gain better economies of
scale in the transmission business, and will invest in more
technology if its spread over a large customer base.''
</P>
<P>
   Just whether foreign ownership of New England Electric, which
operates in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island, will
result in regulatory problems remains unclear. US law makes it
difficult for a overseas companies to buy American utilities. And
while Congress in the early 1990s modified the foreign ownership
rules, the PacifiCorp buyout is expected to be a test case for the
changes, several analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Houston Monday said he did not expect any problems getting
federal regulatory approval. The purchase of New England Electric
will also need a series of approvals from within the states it
serves and Hart-Scott Rodino approval. Monday officials from both
companies said they would seek shareholder approval early next
year. When the deal is completed Richard Sergel, New England
Electric's president and chief executive, will join the National
Grid board and Houston who will step down as chairman. He will
remain a consultant for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Monday Jeffries said both companies began initial discussion
last December about a possible union with more serious negotiations
beginning in September. A major appeal for Nationial Grid was New
England Electric's strength in the transmission business _
high-voltage lines between power generation plants and the New
England electric grid that distributes power where its needed. New
England Electric, with 2,040 miles of transmission cables,
dominates Massachusetts and is second only to Northeast Utilities,
which is the largest in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided that if we expand to the United State we want buy
into strength and we soon realized NEES had what we wanted with a
strong management team, proven track record in operations, a
well-trained work force, and very good cash flow that will add to
our earnings immediately,'' said Jefferies who helped form National
Grid in 1989, when the British government exited from electric
transmission business and sold it to investors to create an
independent company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have nearly 10 years experience in the competitive electric
transmission business in England; Massachusetts is just getting
strated. So we see a lot of opportunities here.''
</P>
<P>
   New England Electric said no layoffs were planned as a result of
the deal.

THE DAY THE PATRIOTS LEFT BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Ship of Fools that is the Connecticut state legislature will
set sail sometime Tuesday. Destination: Poor House.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the experts in these matters say. I'm just passing
along the news.
</P>
<P>
   By nightfall, the local entry in the National Football League
will cease to exist as we know it. They will belong to someone
else. They will be the (Future) Connecticut Patriots. From this day
forward, they belong to Them, not to Us. That's just the way it is.
</P>
<P>
   For 28 years they have officially been known as the New England
Patriots, but they have always remained the (de facto) Boston
Patriots. There has never really been any ambiguity about that.
They will continue to be known as the New England Patriots, but
once they cross that state line they will be the (de facto)
Hartford Patriots, and God bless 'em. Bob Kraft will have made his
choice, and his choice will be Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Boston is Boston. Hartford is Hartford. What's ours is ours.
What's theirs is theirs. We have very little in common. That's a
totally different market down there, no matter what Greg Aiello
says.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Aiello is the NFL's vice president of public relations. He
tells us in the pages of Sports Business Journal that ``Boston will
still be designated as a primary market for the Patriots. The
Patriots will still be Boston's team; they'll just be playing at
another site in that region.''
</P>
<P>
   Where's this guy from? (itals)Montana?(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   Earth to Greg: Go to Hartford and ask for a frappe and see what
you get.
</P>
<P>
   I don't care how many season ticket-holders the Patriots already
have from Connecticut, Central Mass., Western Mass., and Rhode
Island, people who will actually find it easier to get to the game.
That isn't the point, and never was the point. The Patriots as
we've known them have always had a Boston base. They were born
here, and they never really left here. What's such a big deal about
going to Foxborough? It's Greater Boston. Hey, in Houston, it would
easily be inside the city limits.
</P>
<P>
   But Hartford, that's an entirely different matter. The Patriots
might just as well be going to Maui. That's Them territory, not Us
territory.
</P>
<P>
   I do feel somewhat sorry for Bob Kraft, even though he is going
to make a lot of money in his new stadium. He is not, contrary to
what his growing number of detractors think, all about the money.
He is mostly about the money, sure, but not completely. Going to
Hartford is going to be a very painful thing for a man as vain as
Bob Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   By going to Hartford Bob Kraft will never get what he really
wants, and that is to be Mr. Boston. It's either got to be Newton
or it's got to be Newington; you can't have both. Given a choice,
he'd take the former.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he is desperate enough, and foolish enough, to think he
really can have it all. He may believe he can yank the Patriots out
of Massachusetts _ out of (itals)Boston(unitals) _ and no one will
mind up here because he moved the team to Hartford instead of Los
Angeles. He may share the Aiello view. Well, if he does believe
that, he will be wrong. By about the third game of that first
season in Hartford, he will discover that interest in his precious
team up here will be waning. Sometimes I think he's confused. He
acts as if he owns the Red Sox, and not the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut is right to want the Patriots, Red Sox, Celtics,
Bruins, Revolution or any other Boston sports team. Sports
franchises are good for a region. To argue otherwise is to reveal
terminal ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   They are important, but they're not all-important, and the tail
must never wag the dog. In the modern world of finance, it is
appropriate and logical for government to help a franchise get
things done, but that is the clear order, not the other way around.
In the case of Connecticut, the state is not helping Bob Kraft; it
is slobbering over him.
</P>
<P>
   What it has done to induce the Patriots to abandon Massachusetts
is overpay, and overpay to such an extent that the deal concocted
by Governor John Rowland and his henchmen establishes a new
standard for boosterism lunacy, even outdoing the laughable
giveaways in such places as St. Louis, Baltimore, and Charlotte. I
have a name for the new edifice they plan on building atop the
toxic waste dump down there _ the P.T. Barnum Memorial Stadium. All
in all, it's not a bad name at all, since the great 19th century
showman was a bona fide Connecticut guy. They could also re-name
Interstate 91 Tom Thumb Drive if they choose.
</P>
<P>
   Don't these legislators in Connecticut read the papers? Don't
they know that Bob Kraft was willing to accept a deal from the
Massachusetts state senate that was so favorable to the state that
the senate president framed it as a deal Kraft had to refuse?
Except that he didn't? Kraft was willing to accept a very fair
(perhaps even poor in the context) deal from his own state senate.
But the minute he crossed the state line he became the No. 1
candidate for World's Greediest Man. The more the pathetic
supplicants in Connecticut offered, the bigger his eyes got.
</P>
<P>
   The deal makers in Connecticut come away looking hopelessly
desperate and Bob Kraft comes away looking utterly shameless. Did
he not have a warning buzzer of some sort in his head telling him
to stop being so greedy? Where was son Jonathan, or Andy Wasynchuk,
or (itals)anybody(unitals) to save Kraft from himself? They have
subsequently modified the agreement with terms that are more
reasonable for the state of Connecticut, but it still stands as the
single most ridiculous demonstration of, to borrow a phrase,
corporate welfare doled out in the history of this country.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he shouldn't be going anywhere, and he wouldn't be if
our own loathsome legislators were not living in terror. God forbid
anyone in the House should question Tom Finneran, the esteemed
Speaker, who, like so many modern meglomaniacs, loves to refer to
himself in the third person.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Bob Kraft is lying about his financial plight, I do not
know. All we know is that he has chosen to make his play now, and
that play is a move to another state, another market, another
culture and, frankly, an entirely different world where they don't
talk quite so funny.
</P>
<P>
   Today they will officially be lame ducks, the (Boston) Patriots
no more. They're all yours, Hartford. Maybe you can get a bearded
lady to sing the first national anthem at P.T. Barnum Stadium.
</P>

NEW HEAD OF SATURN SHATTERS GLASS CEILING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Tenn., Del.)   (jw) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Facing a shrinking small-car market and struggling to
repair its once-legendary labor relations, General Motors' Saturn
division Monday appointed an expert on sport utility vehicles and
factory management to become chairwoman and president on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The new head of Saturn, Cynthia Trudell, will become the first
woman to head a car division at any domestic or foreign automaker.
GM had been criticized both inside and outside the auto industry
when a management shake-up on Oct. 6 left white men holding all the
jobs in the top three layers of management.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Trudell said that she wanted to push Saturn into new
segments of the auto market while strengthening the division's
experiment in close cooperation between management and labor.
``It's near and dear to my heart that it values partnerships and
relationships,'' she said in a telephone interview from Saturn's
giant factory in Spring Hill, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Saturn workers voted last summer to authorize a strike to
protest what they perceived as GM's lack of commitment to the
division, but the threat faded away after the automaker promised to
continue expanding its Tennessee operations.
</P>
<P>
   With the small-car market shriveling as gasoline prices tumble,
Saturn plans to enter the midsize-car market with a new model next
summer. Ms. Trudell said that after next summer, Saturn is
``definitely looking for ways to expand the portfolio.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Zarrella, GM's new president for North American
operations, acknowledged in an interview last month that Saturn was
working on a sport utility vehicle. ``We're trying to get that in
as quickly as we can,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Trudell is now president of IBC Vehicles, a GM subsidiary in
Luton, England, that makes Frontera sport utility vehicles for the
European market. Set up in 1987 as a joint venture with Isuzu of
Japan, IBC is now wholly owned by GM, but the Frontera still
resembles the Isuzu Rodeo.
</P>
<P>
   Saturn's current chairman and president, Donald Hudler, is
retiring after 43 years with GM and will become chief executive of
Saturn Retail Enterprises, a separate company that GM is setting up
with some Saturn dealers to own dealerships jointly, instead of
leaving auto retailing to the dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Trudell is one of the industry's very few female executives
who have spent a lot of time in factories. The industry's few
female managers have tended to wind up in the personnel, legal,
safety and governmental affairs divisions, often with limited
opportunities to advance.
</P>
<P>
   A Canadian who earned a doctorate in physical chemistry from the
University of Windsor in Ontario, Ms. Trudell worked from 1981 to
1990 at GM's huge transmission factory in Ypsilanti, Mich., where
she served as a senior engineering supervisor, superintendent of
manufacturing, manufacturing engineering manager and finally
operations manager. In the early 1990s, she worked on future engine
technologies and ran an engine factory and foundry in Canada. From
1995 until last year, she ran the assembly plant in Wilmington,
Del., where the Saturn midsized car will be produced.
</P>
<P>
   GM and Ford Motor Co. now have women running their Canadian
operations, and this fall, GM gave two women the title of general
managers of Buick and Oldsmobile, but those divisions have
virtually ceased to exist as separate organizations within GM. They
long ago lost their factories, and in the autumn reorganization
they were stripped of their sales and marketing operations, so the
new general managers are limited to managing the brands.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, full-fledged car divisions like Saturn with their own
manufacturing and marketing operations have been led only by men at
automakers in the United States and overseas, said David Lewis,
professor of business history at the University of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who is also a former aide to two GM presidents, said that
the domestic automakers had little interest in hiring or promoting
women, blacks and Jews until the late 1960s. While attitudes have
changed since then, resistance remains particularly strong to
putting women in charge of manufacturing operations.
</P>
<P>
   Some auto executives still ``will say privately that it's a
man's world and will stay that way,'' Lewis said, adding, ``They
wonder whether a woman can control things.''
</P>
<P>
   Louis Hughes, a GM executive vice president, said in an
interview early this year that GM kept track of the number of women
and minorities in a wide range of jobs and looked at these figures
during every meeting on executive promotions. The automakers have
also set out strict policies against sexual harassment and they are
trying to halt the industry's longtime practice of holding business
lunches in strip bars.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism of the insular Detroit auto industry for not promoting
women and minorities, long heard from outsiders, has recently been
voiced within the industry as well.
</P>
<P>
   Automotive News, a weekly trade journal that is required reading
for auto executives, accused the industry in a recent editorial of
saying that women and minority executives were ``in the pipeline''
but never promoting them. ``On the diversity front, there is
progress, but to see it you need to run an arthroscope down the
pipeline,'' the magazine said.

 &HT;    New Delta business class a legroom up
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Delta Air Lines on Monday unveiled its new
premium-service section, dubbed BusinessElite, to be phased in on
international aircraft over the next eight months.
</P>
<P>
   BusinessElite will replace separate first- and business-class
sections on 57 MD-11 and Boeing 767 jets that fly overseas. It also
will be installed in 14 new Boeing 777 widebodies on order.
</P>
<P>
   The first MD-11 fitted with the new seats and cabin decor will
enter service on an Atlanta-London route Wednesday. The rest of the
planes will be refitted over the next eight months.
</P>
<P>
   Delta said it will spend $314 million on the project.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight of BusinessElite is legroom. Seat pitch _ the
distance between a point on one seat and the same spot on the seat
ahead _ will be 60 inches.
</P>
<P>
   That's from 5 to 12 inches greater than other carriers'
business-class sections and 2 inches more than the current
first-class pitch on Delta's international 767s.
</P>
<P>
   Delta marketing chief Fred Reid said customer research showed an
industry-leading seat pitch was the surest way to win favor. ``For
(international business) travelers, comfort translates into one
word: space,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new recliner seats also feature electric controls and
built-in video entertainment consoles. Delta said it also will
boost the flight attendants-to-passengers ratio and revise food and
drink menus, with those changes appearing next spring. Fares will
remain at current business-class levels.
</P>
<P>
   Delta follows a handful of other carriers that have ditched
separate first- and business-class sections in recent years. The
risk lies in alienating first-class passengers, who typically
include a mix of high rollers and frequent fliers using upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   But the business-class market is much larger and growing faster,
and Delta does not compete on many prime first-class international
routes, Reid said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are routes with a critical mass of investment bankers,
supermodels and rock stars, and we're just not on many of them,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Samuel Buttrick of PaineWebber said first class remains
a valuable perk for an airline's loyal passengers. But he added
Delta ``will be improving the product for a lot more people than it
will be degrading it for.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately Monday, Delta said it finalized a ``code-share'' deal
to market seats on thrice-weekly China Southern Airlines flights
between Los Angeles and Guangzhou, China. The deal gains Delta its
first presence in China.

UNDATED: pitfalls we can.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cuba is determined that its election process never become
dependent upon big private financial contributors, for one thing.
The presiding officer also hopes he can help it avoid the spasms of
harsh personal vituperation he sometimes sees in Congress.
Reputedly the most influential of Castro's top-tier advisers,
Alarcon is said to have the last word on dealings with our country.
He talks freely of changes in Cuban society, apparently comfortable
with their pace of development.
</P>
<P>
   Along the streets and quaint public squares of several Cuban
towns, free enterprise has established a modest beachhead at the
retail level. Officially sanctioned for only the past four years,
family-sized entrepreneurial businesses are setting up shop every
day. Most of these families own small restaurants in private homes
or sell produce grown on individual farms, displayed in open,
city-built markets.
</P>
<P>
   Few if any of these independent merchants grow rich. But most
with whom I talked express satisfaction with the chance to promote
their own economic betterment.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, all groceries had to be purchased at state-owned
``supermarkets'' where public coupons are redeemed and only pesos
are accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can sell everything I grow and bring _ every day,'' boasted
one vendor of fresh vegetables. He tells me his family farm is
almost two hours distant from the market site. Another said she
lives almost three hours' drive time away. Each makes the trek
daily during the prime growing season with a truckload of produce,
and both expect to sell everything they have on display before
beginning the homeward drive. Saturdays are the best.
</P>
<P>
   At one open-air market in Havana one Saturday, I counted 67
vegetable stalls, 15 meat market vendors and five merchants of
home-baked pastries, jams and bottled fruit juice. They display
their wares in seven rows arranged rectangularly under strips of
roofing to offer shade from the Cuban sun. Several hundred
customers browsed while others congregated, discussing prices and
the day's events, under trees that line the avenue and give a leafy
awning to the crowded sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   All the merchandise I saw was homemade or homegrown. There were
individual displays of fruits and vegetables, including some exotic
wares rare to North American grocery shoppers: yucca root, papayas,
guavas, shallots and capotes (a melon-like delicacy).
</P>
<P>
   Most fresh vegetables are quoted at prices that would be cheap
by our standards. Newly picked limes and grapefruit went for less
than three cents a pound. Fresh pork, depending on the cut, varied
from 70 cents to $1.20 in U.S. money. Ribs were offered at 95 cents
a pound. Chickens, available at other markets, had sold out here.
Reportedly, they're cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   What can a small business entrepreneur take home for his day's
work? One assured me that he'd cleared 1,350 pesos the previous
Saturday. On the official exchange rate, this comes to $64 _ not
bad in a country where average family income has been estimated at
around $100 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Local units of government are, in effect, the landlords. They
build and maintain the markets. Stalls are rented to vendors for
the peso equivalent of $7 a day, plus a tax of 13 percent on the
appraised value of the merchandise before sale.
</P>
<P>
   Vegetable vendors have little or no trouble disposing of all
their wares each day. For meat marketers, things are less certain.
Cuban families can afford to serve meat only two or three times a
week.
</P>
<P>
   A major key to the success of any retailer, of course, is the
public's buying power. Among Cubans, cash has always been scarce.
But supply and demand under this limited experiment have been
working gradually in favor of both vendor and customer, I learned.
For the past three years, retail prices have gone down while the
volume of sales has grown.
</P>
<P>
   Pork is the main protein staple, its price a major index to the
cost of living. To sell beef is against the law. Cuba reserves its
cattle feed and pasture for milk-producing dairy herds and still
must import about half its dairy needs. Pork prices at the free
markets today, I'm told, are approximately one-third less than the
going retail rate three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   At state-operated ``supermarkets,'' every family gets a free
basic monthly food ration to cover minimum diet requirements of
beans, rice and pork. The state dispenses coupons to each family
based on the number and age of its members. Every young child is
entitled daily to approximately a quart of milk without charge.
This package covers about half the average family's food
requirements, observers estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody gets rich, and nobody starves. Joy Gordon, in the January
1997 edition of The Atlantic Monthly, called what I'm seeing ``an
economy of loaves and fishes.'' Cubans need surprisingly little
cash.
</P>
<P>
   Besides food and free medical care, the state subsidizes cheap
public transportation and low rent. Housing costs a typical Cuban
family only about 8 percent of its income. But even in a land of
modest luxuries, everybody must have some money. Here, everybody
works, but wages are low.
</P>
<P>
   How do trained physicians and full college professors subsist on
salaries as little as $60 a month? Some, I'm told, moonlight as
taxi drivers or guitar strummers who serenade tourists in the old
city by night.
</P>
<P>
   Most Cubans, judging by those with whom I talked, think things
are getting better _ slowly. Hardened by adversity and reconciled
to reality, they cling to hope.

PALESTINIANS, UNDER CLINTON'S GAZE, VOTE TO CHANGE CHARTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip _ With President Clinton as their witness,
hundreds of former Palestinian guerrilla fighters voted here Monday
to rid their organization's charter of any clauses calling for the
destruction of Israel, knocking down a critical roadblock on the
rutted path to peace.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he accepted the vote, a
show of hands before a worldwide television audience, as ``a real
change, a very positive change.'' But he added that he would not
agree to meet the Friday deadline to return more land to the
Palestinians until they complied with more Israeli demands for
change.
</P>
<P>
   In the interest of breaking stalemates on such other sensitive
issues as the Israeli release of Palestinian prisoners, a three-way
meeting between Clinton, Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat, the
Palestinian leader, was scheduled for Tuesday morning at the Erez
checkpoint between Israel and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   With a flurry of fingers, some barely held aloft, some thrust
into the air with exhilaration, the vote here Monday was momentous
for the Palestinians partly because it represented a new political
pragmatism and partly because it was overseen by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Playing preacher and healer, Clinton presided over what amounted
to a large reunion of the Palestine Liberation Organization at the
moment of its public transformation from outlaw group to nearly
sovereign entity and diplomatic partner of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am profoundly honored to be the first American president to
address the Palestinian people in a city governed by
Palestinians,'' Clinton said, bringing hundreds to their feet, as
he congratulated them on the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``By turning this page on the past you are taking the lead in
writing a new story for the future,'' he continued. ``And you have
issued a challenge to the government and the leaders of Israel to
walk down that path with you.''
</P>
<P>
   In the isolated Gaza Strip, the Palestinians pulled out all the
stops Monday to make Clinton's visit a celebration of imminent
statehood and endorsement by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a dream same as you,'' read posters pinned to trees
and lampposts and donkeys' saddlebags.
</P>
<P>
   American and Palestinian flags fluttered side by side on every
available pole, from the huge hand-sewn flags that draped the
control towers at the new Palestinian airport, where Clinton's
Marine One helicopter landed, to the paper flags in the hands of
schoolchildren adorning the littered route of the motorcade.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat reveled in the moment, which both he and the Americans
called historic many times. The flowery language flowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ancient city that receives you today has not seen many
happy days during its history,'' the Palestinian leader said. ``But
your presence here made us relive the golden days of Palestine.''
</P>
<P>
   At a ceremony to inaugurate the passenger terminal at the new
airport, the Palestinian leader prolonged the ribbon-cutting so
that mementos could be produced.Before viewing stands packed with
dignitaries, Arafat held steady the red ribbon while Clinton cut
off strip after souvenir strip.
</P>
<P>
   Mamoun Tamimi, who had traveled from Jordan to vote against the
change in the covenant, was not terribly impressed by the pomp.
``We should not give a freebie to Israel,'' he said. ``We should
link it with a deal that Israel should recognize our state and we
will recognize theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, everything in Gaza was pre-programmed, and there was no
element of surprise when the Palestinian National Council together
with other Palestinian leaders raised their hands in support of
Arafat's decision to amend the charter.
</P>
<P>
   It was nonetheless a delicate day of diplomacy for the Americans
because Netanyahu's acceptance could not be guaranteed. Clinton
risked a failed trip, but, given the unrest in the West Bank for
the last few weeks, the failure would be much larger than his.

 GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip: than his. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nahum Barnea, an Israeli newspaper columnist, asserted that the
looming challenge for the Americans was ``how to conclude their
visit without leaving the country in flames.''
</P>
<P>
   Pronouncing the visit to Gaza a success, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright made it clear that the Americans believed the
Palestinians, in voting, had met a critical demand of the Israelis,
and that the Israelis would be called upon to comply with their own
promises, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis had insisted on the chrter change, she pointed out,
adding,``It's important for the Israelis to move forward on the
redeployment and I think it would be unfortunate if that did not
happen soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu said he did feel vindicated by the Mondays vote.
``They told us it was impossible, and if you insist on it you're
jamming the process,'' he said. But to him, he said, that proved
that he could hold firm on the other demands, ``and in the same way
try to achieve the other changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Six days before he faces the threat of doom in a no-confidence
vote by the Israeli Parliament, Netanyahu is considered loath to
make any sudden moves forward on the peace agreement that cost him
his right-wing support.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian National Council was the Palestine Liberation
Organization's leadership in exile. This marked only its third
meeting on its home ground in the last 25 years. The first took
place in Jerusalem in 1964, before Israel annexed the eastern part.
</P>
<P>
   The second occurred in Gaza just two years ago, and it was
convened to do just what the leaders did Monday: annul the
offending clauses in the PLO charter. Although the Americans and
the previous Israeli administration accepted the results of that
meeting, the Israelis pointed to the continued inclusion of the
clauses in copies of the charter. They also said the vote should be
loud and public in order to send a message to the Palestinian
people.
</P>
<P>
   For the Palestinians, the Monday vote, attended by about 500 of
an estimated 650 members of the Palestinian National Council, did
not represent a newly felt renunciation of hostile feelings toward
Israel. It was a pragmatic move, most said, meant to appease
Clinton by satisfying Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   A student from the Islamic University, Mohammed Salah, 22, said
the vote itself, even if it produces a breakthrough in the peace
effort, was not terribly significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The charter is not a substantial issue for us,'' Salah said.
``Most people knew nothing about this charter until the Israelis
brought it to our attention. What was substantial was President
Clinton's visit because it sends many signs. It is a recognition.
Clearly, we are not considered anymore a people who nobody wants to
recognize.''
</P>
<P>
   With his special blend of empathy and stern counsel, Clinton at
once endorsed the Palestinian struggle, saying that he felt the
pain of the Palestinians' ``dispossession'' from their land. And he
advised them to feel empathy for the Israelis' point of view as
well, and suggested that Palestinian children not be taught to
glorify suicide bombers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our great American prophet, Martin Luther King, once said,
``The old law of an eye for an eye leaves everyone blind.'''
</P>
<P>
   It was one remark that went unapplauded by the Palestinians
gathered in Gaza.

 &HT;    Baseball has always had haves, have nots
 &HT;    By Terence Moore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ To those expecting the sky over baseball to crash any
day now, you can relax. The sun isn't headed for earth. If the Los
Angeles Dodgers can shove everything except the deed to the Pacific
Ocean into Kevin Brown's pockets, they can afford it.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for the sugar daddies of Mo Vaughn, Randy Johnson,
Mike Piazza and others with yearly earnings enough to push Asia
toward financial bliss by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is splurging on players' salaries, because baseball has
the money to do it. In fact, baseball hasn't been healthier.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance is all the way back to its record level before the
strike of the mid-1990s. The game is broadcast more than ever,
locally, nationally and internationally. There is baseball's boost
from last year's dream season, when Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa
ripped their way past Babe Ruth and Roger Maris in the record
books.
</P>
<P>
   Still, folks have this queasiness. It increases when a $57
million deal for Greg Maddux becomes obsolete after Bernie Williams
signs for $87 million or when the next player turns Brown's deal
into a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   This queasiness also is from the myth about baseball's haves and
have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees just won their second World Series in three
years, and they rank with the haves. So do the Atlanta Braves,
owners of a record seven consecutive trips to the postseason. While
the Baltimore Orioles, Boston Red Sox and Dodgers also own more
resources than most, the Pittsburgh Pirates, Montreal Expos and
Kansas City Royals don't.
</P>
<P>
   The myth? Thanks to the staggering deals by the Murdochs of the
game, baseball is becoming less competitive because of the greater
division between the haves and the have-nots. ``As for the truth,
baseball always has had these divisions, and it actually was much
worse in the past,'' said Leonard Koppett, the noted baseball
historian who has a recently published book, ``Koppett's Concise
History of Major League Baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People keep talking about Montreal and Pittsburgh having
trouble competing. Listen, the St. Louis Browns were around for 52
years, and they finished first just once. I could go on and on.
Prior to free-agency (in 1975), if you were on the bottom, you
stayed there much longer. That's because the teams with the good
players were keeping them under the binding nature of the reserve
clause.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Koppett's research, from 1901 through 1968, four
teams won 79 percent of the AL pennants, and four teams won 75
percent of the NL pennants. From 1969 to 1981, when baseball went
to divisional play and still wasn't affected much by free-agency,
Koppett determined that four teams won 81 percent of the AL
division titles and four teams won 77 percent of the NL division
titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, here's the thing,'' Koppett said. ``Since 1982, when
baseball supposedly was going to have all of these problems from
free-agency, all 14 AL teams have won a division title at least
once. Every NL team has done so, except Montreal and the two
expansion teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Koppett chuckled, before saying, ``One of those two
expansion teams (the Florida Marlins) was a wild card in 1997, and
all they did was win the World Series. Twenty years from now, even
with the current salary rise, you'll see the same thing _
competition.''

 &HT;    Pittsburgh's problem summed up: QB
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ The Pittsburgh Steelers left here Sunday evening
looking for a miracle that might put them in the playoffs. They
won't get one, so director of operations Tom Donahoe and coach Bill
Cowher might spend the offseason searching for an experienced
quarterback to lift the offense out of its doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of reasons explain why the club has managed only two
offensive touchdowns the last 18 quarters, but most of them revolve
around the regression of quarterback Kordell Stewart. In his second
season as the full-time starter, Stewart has lacked the big-play
spark that highlighted his '97 performance.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the problem is that first-year offensive coordinator
Ray Sherman doesn't have full command of the attack. Sherman is
trying to serve as coordinator and quarterbacks coach at the same
time. That was fine for predecessor Chan Gailey, who has more
experience. It's been tough, however, on Sherman, a stand-up guy
who is under all kinds of pressure.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help that Stewart wept openly on the sidelines after
being replaced by Mike Tomczak. A few veterans noted that the
display would hurt his standing in a city whose fans want tough
guys at every position.
</P>
<P>
   Gotham gurus
</P>
<P>
   A photo of a glaring Bill Parcells was on the cover of Sports
Illustrated last week. After Sunday night's victory at Miami, the
magazine ought to consider his New York Jets coordinators, Charlie
Weis (offense) and Bill Belichick (defense), for this week's front.
Belichick had a masterful game plan, protecting suspect corners
Otis Smith and Ray Mickens (in place of the injured Aaron Glenn),
and forcing Dan Marino to throw everything underneath. Weis worked
to create great matchups, especially when he was able to get
wideout Wayne Chrebet working against strongside linebacker Robert
Jones on several occasions.
</P>
<P>
   For the record
</P>
<P>
   Former Dolphins players Bob Griese, Larry Csonka and Dick
Anderson all conceded last week that they were pulling against
Denver's bid for an undefeated season. In a quieter corner of the
world, so was Hall of Fame receiver Dante Lavelli, who played 11
seasons (1946-56) with the Cleveland Browns. From Oct. 19, 1947,
through Oct. 9, 1949, the Browns went unbeaten 29 games in a row,
posting a record of 27-0-2. ``All they talk about is Miami going
17-0 in 1972, and now Denver maybe not losing this year,'' Lavelli
said last week. ``What about our 29-game streak?'' The problem is,
the Browns accomplished their record in the old All-America
Football Conference. When the AAFC folded after the '49 season, the
NFL absorbed three of its franchises but didn't recognize any of
its records. When the NFL and AFL merged in 1966, all of the
statistics from the younger league were included.
</P>
<P>
   Zebra time
</P>
<P>
   Ever heard of Kirk Dornan? He's the back judge who helped keep
the Dolphins' unbeaten record unchallenged. Dornan is the official
who came across the end zone to rule correctly that Giants wide
receiver Amani Toomer had held on to the 37-yard scoring pass from
Kent Graham that gave New York its 20-16 victory against Denver.
The field judge, David Warden, originally signaled that Toomer had
not controlled the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Low profile
</P>
<P>
   Notable in The Sporting News' list of the 100 most powerful
people in sports published last week is that it included zero NFL
players. The league was represented by commissioner Paul Tagliabue
(No. 2), Dallas owner Jerry Jones (25), Denver owner Pat Bowlen
(42), Seattle owner Paul Allen (45), league president Neil Austrian
(54), Denver coach Mike Shanahan (58), Carolina owner Jerry
Richardson (62), NFLPA executive director Gene Upshaw (64), NFL
Properties president Sara Levinson (71), Cleveland Browns president
Carmen Policy (73) and Green Bay coach Mike Holmgren (87).
</P>
<P>
   Big-play Ray
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta agent Ray Anderson always has had a player clientele
that reflects the classy way he conducts business, and now he's
becoming a power-broker among coaches as well. Anderson represents
Dennis Green of Minnesota and Tampa Bay's Tony Dungy, and he could
have a very busy offseason. Anderson also represents Vikings
offensive coordinator Brian Billick, Stanford coach Tyrone
Willingham and Oakland defensive coordinator Willie Shaw. All three
are likely candidates for NFL vacancies.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback update
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-eight different quarterbacks now have started at least one
game in '98, and the number could pass 60 next week. Steve Bono
will start for St. Louis in place of the injured Tony Banks. With
Jamie Martin out for the season and Mark Brunell still lame with an
ankle injury, rookie Jonathan Quinn will start for Jacksonville. In
New England, team doctors have recommended that Drew Bledsoe rest
his surgically repaired right index finger, so Scott Zolak could
get a start against San Francisco on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive tops
</P>
<P>
   Wideout Terance Mathis battled the flu Sunday but still posted
big numbers in Atlanta's victory at New Orleans. The perennially
underappreciated Mathis, never noted for speed, averaged 33.0 yards
on six catches and scored touchdowns of 62 and 63 yards. His 198
yards are a club record. Quarterback Chris Chandler's 345 passing
yards were his most in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive best
</P>
<P>
   Giants linebacker Jesse Armstead has struggled through an
injury-marred season, but he had 13 tackles, two quarterback
pressures and one pass defensed in the upset victory over the
Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   Truly special
</P>
<P>
   Even with kickoff returns for touchdowns by Corey Harris and Pat
Johnson (Baltimore) and David Palmer (Minnesota), it's tough to
overlook the performance of Vikings kicker Gary Anderson. The
15-year veteran hit six field goals Sunday, setting an NFL record
for 34 consecutive conversions on three-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Many happy returns
</P>
<P>
   Besides the three kickoff returns on Sunday, the NFL had a punt,
four fumbles and five interceptions run back for scores. The 13
return touchdowns brings the 1998 total so far to 100, which
projects to 115 for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Introducing . . . .
</P>
<P>
   Second-year veteran Matthew Hatchette was scheduled to be the
Vikings' third wideout this year, but that was before Randy Moss
came along. Hatchette has the kind of size (6-2, 195) the Vikings
love. Filling in for the injured Jake Reed on Sunday, he had five
catches for 95 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Stat stuff
</P>
<P>
   The Baltimore Ravens are 6-18 in the division since owner Art
Modell moved his franchise there in 1996, just another reason why
coach Ted Marchibroda will be fired in two weeks.

 &HT;    Reeves surgery a preemptive strike to prevent future damage
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Doctors averted probable disaster Monday when they
repaired the heart of Falcons coach Dan Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   One of Reeves' heart arteries was completely blocked and two
others were nearly as clogged, Reeves' doctors said after his
open-heart, quadruple-bypass surgery at Atlanta's Piedmont
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had waited any longer, there would have been damage to
the heart muscle _ a heart attack,'' said Dr. Charles Harrison, the
Falcons' team physician.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors emphasized that Reeves, whom they described as a strong
man in good physical condition, should recover fully and rapidly.
In a few weeks he may be able to return to coaching in a limited
capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very optimistic that he's going to have a very good
result,'' said Dr. James Kauten, the cardiac surgeon who performed
the four-hour operation.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves is expected to be transferred from the intensive care
unit to a regular ward this morning and should be discharged from
Piedmont on Friday or Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The diagnosis and decision to operate were sudden. On Sunday
night, after the Falcons game in New Orleans, Reeves told Harrison
he had had pains in his chest and throat for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The pains were familiar: Reeves, who has no family history of
heart disease and no risk factors except high cholesterol,
underwent balloon angioplasty in August 1990 to repair two artery
blockages. The blockages later recurred, but Reeves never took
heart medication, only drugs aimed at reducing his cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   In New Orleans, Reeves tried to dismiss his pains as heartburn
or indigestion and told Harrison, ``I know I'm overreacting.'' But
Harrison insisted that he undergo tests as soon as he returned to
Atlanta. On the plane, Harrison gave Reeves two aspirin, which thin
the blood, making it flow more easily.
</P>
<P>
   Early Monday morning, Dr. Charlie Brown of Piedmont performed a
heart catheterization, a diagnostic procedure in which dye is
injected into the heart vessels.
</P>
<P>
   The catheterization revealed serious blockages. One heart artery
was completely blocked by plaque, a substance made of fatty cells
that accumulate on the inside of arteries. Another artery was 90
percent clogged and a third was 80 percent to 90 percent blocked,
Harrison said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors considered performing balloon angioplasty, a procedure
in which a surgeon inserts a tiny balloon into a blocked artery and
then inflates it to force plaque out of the way. But they opted for
bypass surgery because of the extensiveness of the blockages.
</P>
<P>
   To create the bypasses, Kauten grafted onto Reeves' heart blood
vessels from other parts of his body. He used both internal mammary
arteries, which lie behind the pectoral muscles of the chest, as
well as two pieces of vein from Reeves' right leg, removed via two
short incisions.
</P>
<P>
   As usual during open-heart bypass surgery, Reeves' heart was
stopped, and he was kept alive by a heart-lung pump. Because the
breastbone must be cut in half to perform the operation, Reeves can
expect to feel some pain as it heals. His right leg also might
cause him temporary discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors will prescribe Reeves analgesic medication to control
the pain, but they don't expect him to stay on it for very long.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time he gets back to coaching football, he won't need
pain medication any more,'' Harrison said.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison also said he plans to put Reeves on a more vigorous
cholesterol-reducing regimen, including medication and exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been such a workaholic,'' Harrison said wryly, ``but
we'll encourage him to do more exercise.

 &HT;    Reeves' strength as coach will show in coming weeks
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The day before, the only team Dan Reeves had given his
heart to was a collection of soiled birds atop the NFC West. By
Monday morning, all that had changed. We interrupt this Falcons
dream for a message from Real Life, maker of all sorts of fine
complications. Suddenly, looming large was the very clean
catheterization team. And the heart pump team. And don't forget the
surgical team. The coach couldn't have made it without them. Today,
we appreciate the fact that their records are a little better than
12-2.
</P>
<P>
   If anything should have been learned during the brief Reeves
regime, it's that he surely will try to put open-heart surgery
behind him quickly. That's him, an old-school tough guy whose first
inclination would be to rub a little dirt on the clogged artery and
get back in the game. ``He actually sounded like he felt a little
guilty for having a health problem,'' team president Taylor Smith
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Concern for the man took the point Monday. Reeves is a member of
that club that has turned competitive drive into arterial disease.
``In the NFL, we know that coaching is a major risk factor, but
it's not listed in most of the heart books,'' Falcons team doctor
Charles Harrison said, only half-kiddingly. Following close behind
had to be dark thoughts about it just being the latest curse on a
blighted franchise. Here the Falcons were, completing the most
enjoyable season in 18 years, with their fans holding their breath
the whole way for fear of it all blowing away. Then the designer
and philosophical core of the whole deal goes in for major surgery
just weeks before the playoffs. ``Oh, so this is where it all falls
apart,'' those programmed to pessimism had to think.
</P>
<P>
   I can't quite go along with the company line that the Falcons
will not miss a beat. Of course there's reason to worry about the
team's direction. If it were that easy to get by without the head
coach, why not send them all on early vacation every December and
let the assistants get a little experience? Does your business
operate as smoothly without your boss around? (Perhaps a bad
example.)
</P>
<P>
   What happens the next few weeks will be the ultimate test of
Reeves' organizational model. Appeals to emotion will come and go.
Emergency head coach Rich Brooks offered the first of those Monday:
``(Beating Detroit Sunday) will do more for his health than
anything.'' But more tangibly, it's the system that Reeves has
installed that will have to be strong enough to survive his
absence.
</P>
<P>
   They scurried about Suwanee trying desperately to simulate
normalcy. Brooks began his presentation by reviewing Sunday's
Saints game in minute detail, just as Reeves usually does on
Mondays. They even served the traditional Monday grub, even if that
meant the ironic twist of dishing up pepperoni pizza at a press
conference centering on blocked arteries.
</P>
<P>
   While on the medical front, the word was encouraging. To hear
the doctors tell it, Reeves will be game-planning in two weeks, on
the sideline in four weeks and scaling Everest by June.
</P>
<P>
   Just so long that the coach is not rushed back into the
competitive kiln. No mistake, this is the point upon which a
fantastic season will turn. But it can't mean as much as a single
heartbeat.

 &HT;    Timeline for Dan Reeves' heart surgery
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   November _ Falcons coach Dan Reeves begins experiencing chest
pains but doesn't relay the information to any doctors or assistant
coaches.
</P>
<P>
   1-4 p.m. Sunday _ While on the sideline during a 27-17 victory
over the New Orleans Saints, Reeves experiences chest pains and a
burning sensation in his chest and the back of his throat.
</P>
<P>
   4:20 p.m. Sunday _ After the game, Reeves explains his symptoms
to Dr. Charlie Harrison, one of the team's physicians.
</P>
<P>
   5:15 p.m. Sunday _ Reeves jokes with players while boarding the
team's charter back to Atlanta, handing out pastries. Free safety
Eugene Robinson tussles his hair, ``to loosen him up,'' teammate
Cornelius Bennett says.
</P>
<P>
   6 p.m. Sunday _ Reeves confers on the plane with Harrison, and
the two discuss options. It is agreed that he will undergo an
angiogram the next morning in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   6:30 a.m. Monday _ Reeves checks into Piedmont hospital, and
when dye is inserted into arteries in his heart via
catheterization, none passes through one artery, indicating a
complete, or nearly complete, blockage. So little passes through
two others that it is determined he has at least an 80 percent
blockage in them.
</P>
<P>
   11:30 a.m. Monday _ Reeves undergoes quadruple heart bypass
surgery at Piedmont with cardiac surgeon James Kauten in charge.
Veins are grafted from the inside of his legs and from behind the
pectoral muscles in his chest.
</P>
<P>
   3:30 p.m. Monday _ Surgery is over, and Reeves is moved into
intensive care, where his breathing is assisted by machine for
several hours until about 8 p.m.

 &HT;    Braves stay status quo, don't make roster changes
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ The Braves leave baseball's winter meetings
this morning as they arrived four days before _ with open ears,
empty agenda and zippered wallet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of these meetings came seeds of ideas that may grow into
something more than just ideas,'' general manager John Schuerholz
said. ``But that's pretty much what we expected. We didn't expect
to take any action. We still don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Although left fielder Ryan Klesko remains the most eligible
Braves player for dealing, nothing came close. The Boston Red Sox
made a serious inquiry, but progress stopped after the Braves asked
for right-hander Derek Lowe in addition to a middle-infield
prospect, possibly shortstop Adam Everett. The offer might be
revisited. Everett, from Kennesaw, was Boston's first-round pick
last year and cannot be traded until June, when he will have spent
a full year in the minors.
</P>
<P>
   Reported interest in Klesko by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays never
progressed, and while Arizona had serious internal discussions
about the left fielder, they did not act upon them. The meetings'
biggest names _ Kevin Brown and Roger Clemens _ passed by without
any interest by the Braves, contrary to widespread rumor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked to a couple clubs where there may be some ideas
that, depending on how they finish their moves, may allow something
to work between two clubs,'' Schuerholz said. ``But it is not an
urgent matter. No one is forcing anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Rule 5
</P>
<P>
   Braves minor-league outfielder Tyrone Pendergrass, whose 110
steals the past two seasons led the organization, was taken by the
Chicago White Sox with the final pick of the Rule 5 draft Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Pendergrass, a 22-year-old switch-hitting center fielder, led
the Class A Danville 97's with 143 hits, 73 runs and 10 triples
while stealing 39 bases, third most in the Carolina League. But
with prospect George Lombard slotted for Atlanta in 2000, the
organization declined to protect Pendergrass on the 40-man roster.
In four years in the system, he has played just five games above
the Class A level, and although he has 163 career steals in 382
games, he also struck out 196 times over the last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Rule 5 draft involves minor-leaguers with three years of
experience who are left off 40-man rosters. Since their 40-man
roster is full, the Braves were ineligible to draft. The
organization lost no players in the Class AAA or Class AA phases of
the draft.
</P>
<P>
   On second thought
</P>
<P>
   Toronto GM Gord Ash hoped to have traded Clemens before he came
to Nashville and then expected to deal him before he left the
Opryland Hotel. Ash heads back to Canada 0-for-2.
</P>
<P>
   Although Texas remains a favorite to wind up with Clemens _
owner Tom Hicks has made it a personal mission _ dealings have
grown so complicated it might take months for Ash to sort his
options.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees and Houston remain in the running, with the
Astros staging a remarkable comeback. Owner Drayton McLane
apologized to Clemens' agents for incendiary remarks by Astros GM
Gerry Hunsicker, who on Sunday said he was ``outraged'' by
financial demands made by agents Randy Hendricks and Alan
Hendricks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drayton said he was very sorry,'' Randy Hendricks said, ``and
asked if I wanted a personal apology from his employees and said he
did not do business that way. What they showed with their press
conference was that they're petty and jealous because I was dealing
with the owner.''
</P>
<P>
   McLane then offered a three-year deal at the Hendricks'
requested $43.5 million with an option year. Hendricks replied that
that offer already had been topped, not identifying a five-year $75
million offer made by Hicks. Whenever the money issue is resolved,
the participating teams still have to hash out a trade.
</P>
<P>
   Moves
</P>
<P>
   Butch Huskey , who hit .252 with 13 homers and 59 RBIs with the
Mets, was traded to the Mariners for minor-league pitcher Lesli
Brea. . . . Mark Petkovsek, 7-4 last season in St. Louis, was
traded to Anaheim for a player to be named. . . . Minnesota sent
outfielder Alex Ochoa (.257, two HR) to Milwaukee for a player to
be named. . . . Free-agent catcher Chad Kreuter signed a one-year
contract with Kansas City. . . . The Detroit Tigers signed free
agent catcher Bill Haselman to a two-year contract. . . . Former
Braves pitcher John LeRoy was released by Tampa Bay after going a
2-2 with a 7.75 ERA in the minors. LeRoy was Tampa Bay's 17th pick
in the expansion draft.

PRESIDENT SUFFERS SETBACKS IN FIGHT TO AVOID IMPEACHMENT
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton suffered new setbacks in his
battle against impeachment on Monday as his allies escalated their
counterattack on the Republican-led Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that political momentum may be moving against the
president, Republican Rep. Chris Shays of Connecticut said he is
reconsidering his earlier opposition to impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Shays, a GOP moderate, requested a face-to-face meeting with
Clinton to discuss the president's insistence that he did not
commit perjury. White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton
intends to meet with Shays tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   In another blow for the White House, Republican Rep. Frank
LoBiondo of New Jersey, who had been undecided, declared his
support for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot in good conscience allow the nation's chief law
enforcement officer to violate the law without consequences,''
LoBiondo said.
</P>
<P>
   But the news wasn't all bad for Clinton. CNN reported that Rep.
Virgil Goode of Virginia, one of three Democrats who had declared
support for impeachment, is reconsidering his position. Goode could
not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The other two pro-impeachment Democrats are Rep. Ralph Hall of
Rockwall and Rep. Gene Taylor of Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   A subdued Clinton repeated his willingness to cut a deal with
Congress that would result in a censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe it's in the interest of the United States and
the American people to go through the impeachment process and have
a trial in the Senate,'' Clinton told reporters in Gaza City, in
the Gaza Strip, during a visit to the Middle East. The president is
scheduled to return to Washington tonight to await Thursday's House
vote.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton spoke of compromise, his allies criticized
Republican leaders for refusing to permit a vote on the censure
alternative. The House is scheduled to consider four articles of
impeachment accusing Clinton of perjury, obstruction of justice and
abuse of power. The four articles list 14 possible criminal
violations stemming from Clinton's efforts to hide his extramarital
relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the leadership of the Congress has done is to prevent any
kind of compromise along the lines that the American people want to
see,'' Vice President Al Gore said. ``And instead, they threaten to
put the country through this long ordeal. It's not the right thing
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart, who was traveling with the president, accused GOP
leaders of using the impeachment process to pursue a political
vendetta.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a small group in the Republican leadership who have
made it their mission in life to remove the president,'' Lockhart
said. Gore and Lockhart also ruled out the possibility that Clinton
will resign to avoid a protracted impeachment battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, of course that's not going to happen,'' Gore said.
Lockhart said Clinton's resignation ``would send a pretty sorry
signal to the American people'' that the president surrendered to
partisan pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Partisans on both sides agree that the outcome Thursday is
likely to hinge on about two dozen undecided Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Tarrant County lawmakers are expected to vote along party lines,
with the three Republicans _ Rep. Kay Granger of Fort Worth, Rep.
Joe Barton of Ennis and House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Irving
_ voting for impeachment. Democratic Rep. Martin Frost of Dallas
favors the censure alternative.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid impeachment, Clinton needs help from at least 13 of the
228 Republicans in the 435-member House. Only five, including
Shays, have indicated that they will oppose impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Shays said he had second thoughts when Clinton told reporters
again Sunday that he did not commit perjury. The Connecticut
congressman said Clinton's refusal to admit a criminal violation
shows that ``he still doesn't get it, and he's so intent on
avoiding prosecution that he's willing to put this country in
tremendous turmoil.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Rep. Peter King of New York, who opposes impeachment,
urged House leaders to permit a vote on a censure resolution
condemning Clinton's behavior. Critics contend that censure, which
is not mentioned in the Constitution, would amount to a
congressional copout.
</P>
<P>
   King asserted that at least 15 Republicans privately favor
censure over impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's coming down to the wire. Right now it's too close
to call,'' he said on NBC's ``Today'' show. ``If everyone said
publicly what they're saying privately, this would be a whole
different story.''
</P>
<P>
   As the vote neared, outside organizations stepped up the
pressure on lawmakers. The liberal People For the American Way
announced a $75,000 radio ad campaign aimed at undecided lawmakers.
The ads will run Tuesday through Thursday in Washington,
Philadelphia and Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton supporters, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson, also
planned to hold a vigil outside the Capitol during Thursday's
debate. Conservative groups have been just as forceful in arguing
for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does this `rise to the level' of impeachment? You bet,''
Phyllis Schlafly, head of the conservative Eagle Forum, wrote in
Internet column on Monday. ``Clinton is a national embarrassment at
home and abroad.''

U.N. CHIEF SAYS U.S. GOES TOO FAR IN CALLING FOR IRAQI'S OUSTER
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan distanced himself
from the Clinton administration's policy on Iraq on Monday, saying
American calls for the overthrow of President Saddam Hussein went
beyond a Security Council resolution on what is demanded of Iraq
and ran contrary to the opinion of other United Nations members.
</P>
<P>
   ``The council resolution doesn't talk about getting rid of the
leadership,'' Annan said in an interview Monday, referring to the
1991 cease-fire agreement that laid down the conditions for lifting
sanctions imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in August
1990.
</P>
<P>
   In recent speeches, most clearly in one last week by National
Security Adviser Sandy Berger, Clinton administration officials
have offered the Iraqis a quick end to crippling sanctions in
return for a change in their leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Annan's remarks about differences with the United States were
made against a backdrop of worsening relations between the United
States and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The issues involved include Washington's refusal to pay more
than $1 billion in overdue assessments to the United Nations and
the administration's efforts to enhance the role of NATO while
paying what diplomats here see as only lip service to the
importance of the United Nations to American policies.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Annan met with four influential members of Congress
and was left with the impression, he said, that a new House and
Senate would have to take up outstanding issues anew next year, and
that there was no progress in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the secretary-general said the road to lifting sanctions
had been defined by the Security Council. Once Richard Butler, the
chief arms inspector, decides that Iraq has met the disarmament
qualifications laid down in the critical 1991 resolution, he said,
there should be no excuses for keeping sanctions _ in particular,
an oil embargo _ in place.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has said it will argue against lifting the
embargo until Hussein also meets other demands, including
accounting for Kuwaiti prisoners and improving Iraq's human rights
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's assume that tomorrow, or six months from now, Butler
were to say, `We've disarmed; we're moving on to monitoring,' ''
Annan said. ``The council will have to act, and then it creates a
very serious situation. What will the U.S. do with its veto? What
will the other 14 members do? And how does the world react?''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference earlier in the day, Annan said that ``there
are areas where Washington's policies diverge from that of the
U.N.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one case in point is that of Iraq, where the council
has made it clear that we should disarm Iraq,'' he said. ``And the
moment we get the indication from the inspectors, from Butler, that
Iraq has been disarmed, sanctions will be lifted. American policy
goes beyond that.''
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference, Annan also indicated that an early
comprehensive review of Iraq's relations with the United Nations
should take place no matter what kind of a report Butler submits in
the next few days on Baghdad's cooperation with inspections _ or
lack of it _ over the last three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Butler's U.N. Special Commission said Monday
that the report was likely to go to Annan by Tuesday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The United States and Britain have said there should not be a
review until Iraq cooperates, although both countries appear to
accept that it is inevitable, and Clinton administration officials
have not told diplomats here how hard they will fight to postpone
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure that the comprehensive review is something that
Iraq deserves or does not deserve,'' Annan said at his news
conference. ``I think the council itself would want to know, after
eight years of sanctions, where it stands.''
</P>
<P>
   The secretary-general, summarizing the past year and looking
ahead, was not optimistic that war could be avoided in Iraq or in
Yugoslavia, where under Western pressure, President Slobodan
Milosevic has at least momentarily halted his campaign to put down
ethnic Albanian separatism in Kosovo Province.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best we can say is that in Kosovo, and in Iraq, all-out
war has been avoided for the time being,'' Annan said. ``But unless
people abide by their commitments, and unless they redouble their
efforts to find peaceful solutions, we have every reason to fear
the worst in 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, as arms inspection teams were completing their
withdrawal from Iraq after conducting surprise searches, the Iraqis
renewed personal attacks on Butler, a former Australian
representative at the United Nations, calling him ``a failed
diplomat and a trivial spy.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan said he did not condone this Iraqi tactic, but he also
repeated criticisms of Butler, an outspoken arms control expert who
has often given Iraqis as good as he gets.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, I don't think there should be any rhetoric when
we have serious and hard work to do,'' the secretary-general said.
``I don't believe in megaphone diplomacy.''

TEXAN DELAY KEY TO POSSIBLE CLINTON IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Representative Tom DeLay, hardly a household name
anywhere but in the US House, could go down in history as the
lawmaker most responsible for impeaching President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, a Texas Republican and the House majority whip, has been
one of the president's earliest and harshest critics. But it's no
exaggeration to say DeLay almost singlehandedly has blocked the
House from seeking a lesser punishment than impeachment through his
staunch and compelling opposition to consideration of a censure
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Most Democrats curse DeLay and many Republicans fear him, but
all on Capitol Hill agree that he has earned his nickname _ ``the
Hammer'' _ with his relentless Clinton-bashing and his skill at
nailing down votes for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Martin Meehan, a Massachusetts Democrat on the
House Judiciary Committee, said if the House vote, scheduled for
Thursday, had taken place Monday, Clinton would have been
impeached. Meehan believes DeLay has been successful in rounding up
the votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how DeLay can say with a straight face that he is
not putting pressure on members when he engages in this visible and
aggressive advocacy,'' Meehan said. ``There is not only pressure.
DeLay is providing them a rationale, and a cover, for impeaching
the president.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay said on ``Meet the Press'' Sunday that the vote was ``too
close to call, it could be a 50-50 chance for impeachment.'' He
insisted he was just doing his job ``to gather intelligence and be
the eyes and ears for the leadership,'' and he denied that he was
twisting arms or urging members to remove the president from
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not asked one member to vote one way or another,''
DeLay said. ``I tell my detractors, `Name one member that I have
threatened or asked to vote one way or another.' They can't do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But DeLay clearly took advantage of a GOP vacuum at the top
after the November election _ he was the only member of the
leadership not to face a challenge for his post _ to press his
fervent desire to bring Clinton to trial. And while Speaker-elect
Robert L. Livingston was steering clear of the impeachment debate,
DeLay weighed in, arguing that censure was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the other leaders have maintained such an
extraordinarily low profile on impeachment, DeLay's very passionate
position has had a greater impact on the members,'' said Paul
Weyrich, a conservative commentator who admires DeLay as a ``moral
force'' in the GOP House. ``You've got lawmakers saying, `Gosh, I
may not feel as strongly as Tom, but I respect him, and I know I've
got to be able to work with him.'''
</P>
<P>
   The job of the majority whip _ the No. 3 position in the House
leadership, after speaker and majority leader _ is twofold: to
track where members stand on important issues and to cajole or
coerce wavering lawmakers and bring them into line with the party's
position. Whip-watchers say DeLay is a master of both.
</P>
<P>
   ``My boss says DeLay is the best whip he's ever served with in
28 years in the House,'' said Don Carlson, chief of staff to
Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican whose Houston
district is adjacent to DeLay's. ``He has an uncanny ability to
relate to members. He knows their districts and he knows where they
are on the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlson believes DeLay honed his skills in the Texas House from
1978 to 1984, when being an effective Republican required
considerable dexterity in the Democratically controlled
legislature. DeLay, who before politics ran a pest-control business
in suburban Sugar Land, was elected to the US House in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, 51, got appointed to the powerful House Appropriations
Committee in his second term and has brought millions of dollars
home for transportation improvements and the Johnson Space Center
in his district. A born-again Christian, DeLay is a favorite of the
Christian Coalition and social conservatives who oppose abortion
rights and support school prayer and school vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   But it has been his tenure since 1995 as majority whip that has
earned DeLay a reputation as both an accommodating Mr. Fixit and a
hardball legislator.
</P>
<P>
   GOP consultant Frank Luntz calls DeLay a ``go-to guy,'' because
he is always there when members need advice, a favor, or very
practical help in setting up an office, hiring staff, or running a
fund-raiser. Indeed, DeLay is making space in his own office during
this week's lame-duck session for members displaced by retirement
or defeat in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason DeLay has done so well is that he is honest,
straightforward, and loyal,'' Luntz said. ``He's not afraid to take
on an uphill battle or back up a colleague. This isn't typical
behavior in a body where people like to run the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   But DeLay isn't called the Hammer for nothing, said Norman
Ornstein, a political analyst at the American Enterprise Institute.
``He is relentless and very, very tough; some would say mean,''
Ornstein said. ``He relishes combat and is much feared for what he
is willing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example, Ornstein cited DeLay's recent assault on the
Electronic Industry Association. When the trade group hired former
Democratic Representative David McCurdy of Oklahoma to be its head,
passing over retiring Republican Bill Paxon of New York, DeLay
instructed GOP members to refuse to talk to association lobbyists.
He also threw wrenches into two copyright treaties the trade
association wanted ratified.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry, to its credit, didn't cave, but it showed that
DeLay has every intention of coercing the firms on K Street to hire
Republican lobbyists,'' Ornstein said.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay's reward for helping elect Livingston to the speakership
was more power to keep lobbyists, as well as legislators, in line.
But the whip denies that he is a hammer, a name he said the
Washington Post gave him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I'm a little blunt and forthright in what i believe,
and that's created an image that I don't think I am, quite
frankly,'' DeLay said Sunday.

 &HT;    Lobbyists seek undecided votes in Congress; Clinton faces vote
for impeachment
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More Republican lawmakers said Monday they would
vote to impeach President Clinton as lobbying efforts to sway the
undecided intensified in advance of Thursday's historic debate.
</P>
<P>
   With the president telling reporters in the Middle East that he
is open to ``any reasonable compromise,'' Vice President Al Gore
criticized House Republican leaders for not allowing a vote on
censure of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the leadership of the Congress has done is to prevent any
kind of compromise along the lines that the American people want to
see, and instead, they threaten to put the country through this
long ordeal that would ensue,'' Gore said in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The latest public opinion polls continue to show a clear
majority of Americans oppose Clinton's impeachment for his actions
to cover up his affair with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But the country also does not want to see the president escape
punishment. The polls show most Americans favor censure, a formal
denunciation of Clinton that the president last week signaled he
would accept.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the news Monday from Capitol Hill was not reassuring for
the president.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans Frank LoBiondo of New Jersey and James Walsh of New
York, two Northeasterners whom Democrats had identified as
potentially friendly to Clinton, announced they would vote for at
least one of the four articles of impeachment accusing the
president of perjury, obstruction of justice and abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans who said Monday they would support impeachment
are: Nathan Deal of Georgia, Charles Bass of New Hampshire and Zach
Wamp of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   One other Republican who has said he would oppose impeachment
edged away from that position. Rep. Christopher Shays of
Connecticut said he is ``willing to reconsider'' his opposition and
requested a meeting with Clinton when the president returns from
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides were trying to arrange the meeting for as
early as Wednesday, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Shays said he was disappointed by Clinton's speech from the
White House Rose Garden on Friday and his remarks in Israel
insisting that he did not commit perjury in his deposition in the
Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit, his testimony to independent
counsel Kenneth Starr's grand jury and his written response to 81
questions posed by the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's comments both before he left and in Israel are
very unsettling to me because it shows me he still doesn't get it,
and he's so intent to avoid prosecution that he's willing to put
this country in tremendous turmoil,'' Shays told The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   One of a handful of anti-impeachment Republicans, Shays said he
will meet with constituents tonight to discuss the issue. ``I don't
have the same level of conviction I had a week ago,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton should ``say that he did not tell the truth and in fact
he lied, and say he's willing to face the court like any other
American citizen and be held accountable for his actions'' after
leaving office, Shays said.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Craig, a Clinton aide, said Republicans are making an
unfair demand on the president ``that he plead guilty to a felony
in order to avoid impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   White House counsel Charles Ruff told the Judiciary Committee
last week that Clinton would not accept a pardon when he leaves
office, Craig added.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's chances of avoiding impeachment rest on moderate
Republicans like Shays who come from districts whose voters
supported Clinton in the 1996 election and are split between
Republicans and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 Republicans in the House would have to vote ``no'' on
impeachment to tip the balance in Clinton's favor, if Democrats are
correct that no more than six members of their caucus will join the
pro-impeachment camp.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republican lawmakers who remain undecided, at least
publicly, reported a sizable jump in telephone calls, faxes and
e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our offices (in Washington and Georgia) are getting
continuous calls,'' said Grace Cummings, chief of staff to Rep.
Jack Kingston (R-Ga.). Kingston said Monday he is ``leaning in
favor'' of a vote for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leadership in the House, meanwhile, continued
preparations for the impeachment debate, expected to begin at 10
a.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers probably will have six to eight hours to speak on
impeachment, followed by a vote on each of the four articles, said
Michele Davis, spokeswoman for House Majority Leader Richard Armey
(R-Texas).
</P>
<P>
   The voting is likely to start Thursday evening, unless
parliamentary tactics by Democrats intent on allowing a censure
resolution push the votes to Friday, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are trying to devise a way to force a procedural vote
on censure, believing that most Democrats and enough Republicans
would jump at the chance to bring the impeachment issue to a close.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Livingston (R-La.), the speaker-designate, has vowed
to prevent the censure move, calling it a test of loyalty for House
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary Committee staff members expect to finish the report
recommending impeachment late tonight or early Wednesday. The
report will be available on the Internet at
http://www.house.gov/judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   The clerk of the House will distribute the report to all
members' offices Wednesday along with the Democrats' dissenting
views on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Most House members will drift into town Wednesday, when both
parties are expected to stage closed-door meetings to discuss
strategy for the first televised impeachment debate in the House's
history.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the two years since Congress passed tough laws to
stem the flow of illegal immigration to the United States, federal
authorities have deported almost 300,000 immigrants to countries
all over the world, more than twice the number of people who were
sent back in the two years before.
</P>
<P>
   The unprecedented number of deportations has been possible
because for the first time the Immigration and Naturalization
Service has both the congressional mandate and the money to
investigate and prosecute violators of immigration law, arrest
immigrants with criminal convictions and would-be immigrants at the
border and swiftly deport them from the United States _ sometimes
in less than 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the immigrants who are deported are barred from
returning to the country for five years or more. Some are barred
for life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules have changed,'' said Kerry Bretz, a Manhattan
immigration lawyer who is a former prosecutor for the INS. ``The
agency has become completely enforcement-minded.''
</P>
<P>
   Flush with almost a billion dollars earmarked for the detention
and deportation of immigrants, the INS is now the largest federal
law enforcement agency, the Justice Department says. The
immigration service has more than 15,000 officers authorized to
carry weapons and make arrests, more than the FBI, the Bureau of
Prisons, the Customs Service or the Drug Enforcement
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is as if, suddenly, war had been declared on immigrants,''
said Maria Jimenez, director of the Immigration Law Enforcement
Monitoring Project of the American Friends Service Committee, a
nonprofit organization in Houston that documents abuses on the
U.S.-Mexico border. ``Stopping immigrants from entering the country
has become more important than the war against drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the law was changed, most of those deported had been
convicted of crimes. Now, most are people who do not have criminal
records but are caught at the southwest border attempting to enter
the country with no documents or with fake documents.
</P>
<P>
   About 78,000 immigrants who had managed to sneak into the
country undetected only to be caught later were also deported in
the last two years. They were arrested during job raids, at routine
traffic stops, at airports while returning from abroad and even at
immigration offices around the country, where immigrants often go
to seek services and sometimes end up under arrest to await
deportation.
</P>
<P>
   Many had lived here for years, working, paying taxes, studying
and establishing families. Their deportation often causes a great
deal of emotional pain and financial distress to the families left
behind.
</P>
<P>
   The family of Fernando Giraldo, one of the illegal immigrants
deported last year, is still trying to get him back to New York
City, where he lived and worked for almost a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Giraldo, a 36-year-old amateur poet from Colombia, sneaked into
the United States through the southwest border a decade ago. The
authorities detained him at the airport in El Paso, Texas, as he
was about to board a plane. An immigration judge ordered him to
leave the country in 30 days and released him on bond.
</P>
<P>
   But Giraldo ignored the judge's decision and flew to New York to
join his family in Brooklyn. For nine years, he went undetected by
the authorities. He worked as a maintenance supervisor in a midtown
Manhattan hotel and led what he calls ``a normal, happy life.''
</P>
<P>
   His luck ran out one morning in the summer of 1997. Giraldo had
gone to the downtown Manhattan immigration office for a scheduled
interview with an immigration officer, one of the steps in his
quest for permanent residency. He said he was sure the meeting
would conclude with a handshake and a stamp on his Colombian
passport, making him a legal resident of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Giraldo was arrested, handcuffed and sent to a
detention center in Queens. Less than 48 hours later, he was on a
plane to Bogota. He is now barred from trying to enter the United
States for 10 years and, even then, his return is not guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never even finished breakfast,'' Giraldo said from his home
in Pereira, Colombia. ``I had told my mother that we would have
coffee when I returned from the interview and I just never did.''
</P>
<P>
   With Giraldo's deportation, his mother, Maria Judith Valencia,
63, and his sister, Maritza Giraldo, 22, both permanent residents
of the United States, were left to fend for themselves. Ms.
Valencia, who suffers from muscle spasms in the eyelids and cannot
keep her eyes open without medication, started making pastries at
home and selling them to friends and neighbors. Ms. Giraldo, a
senior studying marketing at Baruch College, had to leave school to
find a job.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the year Giraldo was deported, the INS set a
deportation goal for the first time _ and surpassed it: 114,285
people were deported; the goal was 93,000. In 1998, when $748
million, a record, was budgeted solely for the detention and
deportation of undesirable immigrants, 169,072 people were
deported. The goal was 127,300.
</P>
<P>
   The money has also allowed the agency to triple the number of
beds available in detention centers and local jails around the
country and increase personnel by 80 percent. The added beds and
personnel are crucial because the agency must detain immigrants
before it can deport them.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in funds has also allowed immigration officials to
conduct more investigations than it had in the past. Now, the
agency can routinely conduct job raids and check on anonymous tips
from, say, people who notice a sudden influx of immigrants in their
neighborhood. They also have the resources to identify a particular
problem in a specific state and combat it through deportation.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Just two months ago, INS agents rounded up more than 500 legal
immigrants in Texas who had at least three drunken-driving
convictions. Their detention is the first step in a process that
could culminate in their deportation. Immigration officials in
Washington said no other state had followed Texas' lead, but, by
law, they could.
</P>
<P>
   ``We apprehend and take into custody more people than any other
agency in the world,'' said Russell A. Bergeron Jr., an INS
spokesman in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The law got tougher for immigrants who were not citizens in
1996, when Congress, bowing to political pressure from states
overwhelmed by large immigrant populations, passed the Illegal
Immigration and Reform Responsibility Act. The act granted the INS
a wide range of power afforded previously only to the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Through a process called expedited removal, for example, the law
now allows immigration officials to quickly deport illegal
immigrants who show up at airports and at the border. Immigration
officials, not judges, determine which of them can be deported and,
therefore, barred from the United States for at least five years.
The decision can be made in a matter of hours and without a lawyer
representing the immigrant.
</P>
<P>
   The law also expanded the definition of a deportable crime and
directs the immigration agency to deport immigrants convicted of
crimes even if the immigrants are permanent and legal residents of
the United States. While the agency has always been required to
deport murderers and rapists, now people who have forged checks or
committed minor sex offenses, like touching a woman
inappropriately, are also being deported. In addition, the law took
away the discretionary power of judges, who in the past were able
to consider mitigating factors before issuing orders of
deportation.
</P>
<P>
   Before the law changed, immigration officials at the border used
to simply send illegal immigrants back without formally deporting
them. Undaunted, immigrants tried again and many eventually
succeeded at entering the country undetected. Now, any immigrant
caught trying to enter the country after having been formally
deported can be prosecuted and sentenced to prison.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, many immigrants who had committed crimes were
allowed to leave prison after completing their sentences because
there was no place to detain them pending deportation. Now, with
the increase in detention beds, such immigrants remain behind bars
while awaiting deportation. More than 106,000 immigrants with
criminal convictions were deported in 1998, a 52 percent increase
over the previous two years.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials say it is too early to know if the high
number of deportations is having the intended effect: to send a
clear message to would-be immigrants that coming to the country
illegally is punishable.
</P>
<P>
   ``After so many years of the laws being ineffectual, it is going
to take a long time to restore the credibility of the immigration
laws,'' Bergeron said. ``You are not going to have an overnight
shift on the way people think.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers and advocates for immigrants, though, say the laws have
begun to affect the lives of their clients. Detention and
deportation of people already living in the United States legally
or illegally has become so pervasive that many of these immigrants
_ who, unlike those caught at airports or at the border, have the
right to hearings and appeals _ are giving up on the legal process
and leaving the country on their own.
</P>
<P>
   By doing that _ in essence, deporting themselves _ they may
avoid both a formal federal deportation order and a long stay at a
detention center while their cases wind through the courts. Those
who are not criminals can also avoid being barred from re-entering
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law, in practical terms, deprives them of due process,''
said Nancy Morawetz, a professor at New York University School of
Law. ``Congress passed these laws without paying really close
attention to them. And the results are just awful.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, who is chairman of the House
Immigration Subcommittee and one of the architects of the law, said
the decision of immigrants to leave voluntarily showed that the law
was effective. ``The goal is to make sure as many illegal aliens as
possible return home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But immigration officials and advocates for immigrants say the
law was too broad. To detain all the convicted criminals who
should, under the law, be behind bars, the INS will have to receive
even more funds from Congress, Bergeron said. Immigration officials
have calculated that the agency would need up to 21,000 additional
beds and as many as 1,500 additional employees. To cover those
costs, the current budget of about $700 million will have to
increase by $652 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always said the law went too far,'' Bergeron said.
</P>
<P>
   Already, some detention centers are dangerously overcrowded,
lawyers for immigrants say. Last month, a disturbance took place at
a detention center in lower Manhattan. About 80 detainees started a
protest because they were sleeping on mattresses on the floor in a
dormitory meant to house only 42 people.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid such disturbances, Bergeron said, the agency will have
to continue choosing whom to detain and whom to let go. But just
how those decisions are made is not always obvious to the relatives
of those behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Gaul, whose adopted son, John Gaul, awaits deportation at a
jail in north Florida, said she could not understand why the
authorities considered him a dangerous criminal worthy of
deportation. Gaul, 25, was convicted of check fraud and of stealing
a car four years ago. Because he was born in Thailand and never
became a U.S. citizen, he is what the law calls a ``criminal
alien,'' and, therefore, deportable.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gaul and her former husband adopted John when he was 4 and
always thought that, because he had been adopted by U.S.-born
parents, he would be protected by the laws of the United States. He
is not, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made a mistake, but do we punish him for life?'' asked Ms.
Gaul, a 52-year-old respiratory therapist who works at a hospital
in Tampa. ``Essentially, for me, they are trying to take away his
life and they are ripping our family apart.''

 &HT;    Another Georgian will vote to impeach
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The ranks of the undecided in Georgia's
congressional delegation dwindled further Monday as Republican Rep.
Nathan Deal said he would vote to impeach President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Two Republicans, Speaker Newt Gingrich and Rep. Jack Kingston,
and Democratic Rep. Sanford Bishop remain officially undecided in
advance of Thursday's debate, just the second time in history that
the House will consider impeaching the president.
</P>
<P>
   But vote counters in both parties expect the Georgians to side
with the overwhelming majorities in their respective parties _
Republicans in favor of impeachment and Democrats opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Deal, a lawyer and former Democrat who represents North Georgia,
said he believes Clinton broke the law in his efforts to conceal
his sexual relationship with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is regrettable that we are faced with this matter,'' Deal
said in a statement. ``To ignore it, however, would be to diminish
our respect for the rule of law and would violate my obligation to
support and uphold the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   He held off announcing his position until the Judiciary
Committee finished its work Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Kingston said Monday that he is ``leaning in favor of voting for
impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kingston acknowledged the gravity of the coming votes on
four articles accusing Clinton of perjury, obstruction of justice
and abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a vote that must stand the test of time,'' Kingston said.
``You won't have any second shots on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kingston's office has been besieged by callers on both sides of
the issue, constituents as well as people from as far away as
California.
</P>
<P>
   A Baltimore man told Kingston Chief of Staff Grace Cummings that
he had stayed home from work Monday to call each of the 435
representatives and register his support for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our message machines ran out over the weekend,'' Cummings
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Bishop's office, the calls were running about even, said
spokesman Selby McCash.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop is the one Georgia Democrat who some analysts have said
may be open to casting a vote for impeachment because he represents
a conservative agriculture district in southwest Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   But when the House voted to open an impeachment inquiry just
weeks before the congressional election, Bishop voted against a
broad Republican proposal and for a more limited Democratic
alternative. He easily won re-election to a fourth term in the
House.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop's Democratic colleagues in Georgia, John Lewis and
Cynthia McKinney, oppose Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, a strong supporter of the president's, has not sought to
lobby any of the undecided Republican moderates whose votes are
likely to determine whether Clinton is impeached, Lewis spokesman
Jack Pannell said.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Democrat would be a logical choice to attempt to
enlist Republicans in opposition to impeachment because he is part
of an interracial, bipartisan group in the House that meets
periodically to talk about race.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone calls and faxes to Lewis' office have been solidly
against impeachment, Pannell said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats at one point thought that Republicans Saxby Chambliss
and Charlie Norwood could be persuaded to vote against impeachment
because they represent districts that Clinton won in the 1996
election and that have large African-American populations.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, both men announced their intention to support
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans Bob Barr, Mac Collins and John Linder also will vote
to impeach Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Linder predicted that at least one of the four articles would
``very narrowly'' pass the House, putting Clinton in the company of
Andrew Johnson as one of the only two presidents to be impeached.

 &HT;    Miss America, she's on a real-life mission
 &HT;    By Richard L. Eldredge
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Miss America 1999 Nicole Johnson was missing a
crowning fashion accessory when she visited Grady Memorial Hospital
in Atlanta, Ga., on Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't wear the tiara at all,'' Johnson told Buzz as she
kicked off a national diabetes awareness and screening campaign.
``I have this disease myself so this campaign is very personal to
me. I want people to hear what I have to say and not be distracted.
If I'm up there wearing a crown, my validity is shot.''
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta stop is part of a 17-city tour designed to motivate
at-risk people to be tested for the disease, which can cause
serious health problems if untreated. ``It only takes 60 to 90
seconds and it's just a finger prick,'' says Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   As for her and Miss America 1998 Kate Shindle's equally
progressive AIDS awareness campaign, Johnson is philosophical.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really just the luck of the draw that both campaigns
turned out to focus on public health concerns,'' she says. ``What's
enjoyable for me is to see how the Miss America program is
modernizing and how it's become more realistic. We need a woman
who's normal that we can relate to. We don't need a Barbie doll.''

   In an unprecedented speech to more than 700 Palestinians,
Clinton called on Israel to recognize ''the right of Palestinians
to aspire to live free,'' and told the Palestinians gathered here
that they have ''the opportunity to shape a new Palestinian future
on your own land.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians reciprocated by removing from their charter
decades-old language calling for the destruction of Israel, in a
dramatic move White House officials insisted would help salvage the
deeply troubled Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were scheduled to meet together early
Tuesday at the Israeli-Gaza bordertown of Erez to discuss modest
steps meant to hold together the U.S.-led effort to move ahead with
a process through which Israel has essentially vowed to surrender
certain occupied territories to Palestinian control in exchange for
Palestinian measures to combat terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   With key ingredients of that process stalemated, and Netanyahu's
political future in doubt, there was no assurance that Tuesday's
meeting would bear fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, with Netanyahu facing a possible no-confidence
vote in the Israeli Knesset as early as next week, White House
officials fear that Israel will continue to delay promised troop
withdrawals from occupied West Bank territories. A Friday deadline
for one phase of the planned redeployments is not expected to be
met.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials voiced guarded hope, though, that Monday's
breathtaking historic developments might provide a badly needed
opening for peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have had really quite an extraordinary day,'' U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told reporters late Monday
night. ''A page was turned.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stopped short of endorsing the creation of a free
Palestine, a potentially explosive issue near the heart of five
decades of Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
</P>
<P>
   By making a ceremonial arrival at the new Gaza International
Airport, where he was feted by a Palestinian honor guard and
received by a broadly beaming Arafat, Clinton's visit and his
dramatic words of support clearly added incalculable momentum to
the goal of carving out a Palestinian state from long-disputed
lands.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am profoundly honored to be the first American president to
address the Palestinian people in a city governed by
Palestinians,'' a line that drew a standing ovation from a crowd of
some 700 Palestinian officials, executives and activists that
filled the largest public hall in this struggling city by the
Mediterranean Sea.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know that the Palestinian people stand at a crossroads,''
Clinton told the delegation, ''behind you a history of
dispossession and dispersal, before you the opportunity to shape a
new Palestinian future on your own land.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Clinton, ''This moment would have been inconceivable a
decade ago,'' later adding, ''I hope you have begun to see America
as your friend.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional trim follows.)
</P>
<P>
   For decades, U.S. and Palestinian interests have been in direct
confrontation, chiefly because the Palestinian charter -- a sort of
de-facto constitution for the stateless Palestinians -- contained
provisions calling for the destruction of Israel, Washington's
closest strategic ally in the oil-rich Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, the Palestinians and their Arab backers have
fought a series of wars with Israel since the creation of the
Jewish state in 1948. Separately, thousands have been killed on
both sides of the conflict by terrorist attacks, mostly
Palestinian, and military action, mostly Israeli.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, however, roughly two-thirds of the Palestinian
National Council, a sort of rough start at representative
government, affirmed the nullification of all charter references to
Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that this will close this chapter forever,'' said
Arafat. ``We are determined to contnue our quest for peace -- peace
of the brave -- nd coexistence on the basis of respecting jutice
and international legitimacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told the delegates, ''You did a good thing today in
raising your hands. You know why? It has nothing to do with the
government in Israel. You will touch the people of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't clear how many of the council's 650 members were
present -- many boycotted the meeting in protest -- but White House
officials estimated that at least 500 council members attended and
perhaps 80 percent signaled their approval with uplifted hands.
</P>
<P>
   The charter amendments have been a sticking point in the
implementation of agreements Clinton brokered between Arafat and
Netanyahu six weeks ago at the Wye River Plantation in rural
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very important step,'' Netanyahu said at a press
conference after the Palestinian meeting. ''I welcome it. It is a
positive step.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also applauded the move. ''I thank you for your
rejection -- fully, finally and forever -- of the passages in the
Palestinian charter calling for the destruction of Israel,'' he
told Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ''It does not hurt Israelis to hear Palestinians peacefully and
pridefully asserting their identity, as we saw today,'' Clinton
said. ''And it does not hurt Palestinians to acknowledge the
profound desire of Israelis to live without fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking the point a step further, Clinton said, ''Palestinians
must recognize the right of Israel and its people to live safe and
secure lives today, tomorrow and forever. Israel must recognize the
right of Palestinians to aspire to live free today, tomorrow and
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   White House National Security Adviser Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger
explained later that Clinton went to great pains to not
specifically endorse Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
   That issue, Berger said, can only be addressed through direct
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, as part of so-called final status
talks, aimed at drafting a comprehensive plan for enduring peace in
the fractious Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe very strongly that that is an issue that ought to
be negotiated between the parties,'' Berger told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, Clinton's visit here -- agreed upon by Arafat and
Netanyahu at Wye -- clearly conferred an aura of presidential
legitimacy upon the Palestinians' aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people in that room felt validated as human beings, as
Palestinians, as a people, by virtue of the fact that the president
of the United States came to Gaza and spoke to them,'' said Berger.
''But, in no way was this an effort to prejudge what only the
parties can decide.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Berger, ''Does the president coming here, by agreement
between Israel and the Palestinians, give some legitimacy to the
Palestinian people? I think it does.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he continued, ''I think there's a difference between that
and a question of what the ultimate status of the territories
are.''

RJR NABISCO PLANS CUTS IN BOTH TOBACCO AND FOOD UNITS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hurt by economic weakness abroad and the impact of the
smoking-litigation settlement, the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. said
Monday that it would close plants and cut 15.6 percent of its
worldwide tobacco work force, as well as restructure and reduce
jobs in its food business.
</P>
<P>
   One thousand of the 3,900 tobacco jobs to be eliminated and an
undetermined percentage of the 1,500 food jobs to be cut are in the
United States. The moves will result in a fourth-quarter after-tax
charge of $348 million, or $1.07 a share, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The New York-based conglomerate said that it was cutting back
its tobacco operations, which employ 25,000 people, partly because
of reduced cigarette sales.
</P>
<P>
   It also said that it faced increased competition with other
producers as a result of the recent $206 billion settlement between
the industry and 46 states that had sued cigarette makers to
recover health costs related to smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew when we agreed to resolve the state tobacco litigation
that the domestic tobacco company would have to make enormous
sacrifices financially and operationally,'' Steven F. Goldstone,
RJR Nabisco's chairman and chief executive, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Operationally,'' he added, ``the settlement will result in
more difficult business conditions that will require the company to
scale back a major production facility and employment and
aggressively attack other costs.''
</P>
<P>
   To finance the cost of the settlement, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco,
the corporation's cigarette subsidiary, has raised wholesale
cigarette prices by 45 cents a package. Several analysts have said
that while the price increase will not likely cause people to quit
smoking, it may lead them to reduce the number of cigarettes they
smoke or to switch to less expensive brands.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The company's international tobacco business, particularly in
the countries of the former Soviet Union, has floundered for some
time because of worsening economic conditions. As a result, smokers
in those countries, rather than buying higher-priced Western
cigarettes, have gone back to cheaper local brands.
</P>
<P>
   The cut of 1,000 domestic tobacco jobs comes in addition to 300
positions eliminated earlier this year. The tobacco unit is based
in Winston-Salem, N.C.; its leading brands include Winston, Camel
and Salem.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco unit said that the added 2,900 job cuts would come
in Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union. The
company began job cutbacks and plant closings in those countries a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nabisco Holdings, a food company that is 80 percent owned by RJR
Nabisco Holdings, said Monday that it would make another round of
job cuts and plant closings following a restructuring announced in
June.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, the food unit, which makes products like Oreos
cookies, said it would reduce its worldwide work force of 52,000 by
6 percent, or 3,100 workers. The company also announced the closing
of two domestic production facilities in Pittsburgh and Seville,
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Company spokesman Henry Sandbach said that the newest round of
job cuts would involve about 3 percent of the company's work force.
He said that additional plants both in this country and overseas
would also be closed, though final decisions about specific
facilities had not been made.
</P>
<P>
   James M. Kilts, president and chief executive of Nabisco, said
that the food company already was realizing cost savings from the
first restructuring round and expected further benefits from the
latest moves.

<P>
   Just over five years ago, President Bill Clinton stood on the
White House lawn watching Israel's Yitzhak Rabin and the
Palestinians' Yasser Arafat shake hands on a historic peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Oslo'' accord truly was historic _ the first such deal
after 45 years of mutual hatred and non-recognition _ and much has
changed since then. Yet much, much more remains to be changed _ and
much has not changed at all, or even changed for the worse.
</P>
<P>
   This paper in 1993 foresaw a long, hard, potholed road to peace.
When Clinton arrives to visit both sides on Dec. 12 he will find
that the road has been even harder, and the potholes deeper, than
skeptics foresaw; and that the road ahead may well prove longer and
harder still, or even lead nowhere at all.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate sign of that has been the row over the recent Wye
mini-accord. Palestinians have been angered _ into disorder and
violence, some of them _ to find that a promised release of
Palestinian prisoners in practice meant more common criminals than
of the 2,000-odd political prisoners held by Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli government replied last week that freeing people
``with blood on their hands,'' or Hamas members, was no part of
Wye, and that it would stop implementing the accord unless the
Palestinian Authority admitted as much, halted and punished
violence and incitement to it, and renounced Arafat's threat to
declare a Palestinian state next May whether Israel agreed or not.
</P>
<P>
   Such roadblocks are removable; Arafat went halfway on Dec. 6,
talking only of ``agreement'' on a Palestinian state, not of a
unilateral declaration if none could be reached. But the spirit
that sets roadblocks up is far harder to shift.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the five years since Oslo, Palestinians gravely doubt
that Rabin's current successor (and old opponent), Benjamin
Netanyahu, really wants peace at all; and he does not trust them to
mean peace when they say it.
</P>
<P>
   Next May was supposed _ hence Arafat's deadline _ to see the end
of the ``final-status'' negotiations. They have not yet begun.
</P>
<P>
   Why not? The straightforward answer is that things were always
bound to get bad and bitter as the final-status talks, and the
really hard issues such as Jerusalem grew nearer, and neither side
was ever likely to be in a hurry to grapple with those decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are other answers too, which make a normal
deadlines-concentrate-the-mind optimism hard to share.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, in particular, has dragged its feet, though not without
reason: more Israelis have been killed by terrorism since Oslo than
before it, and Arafat is widely blamed for failing to prevent such
outrages by Hamas and others.
</P>
<P>
   It was shock at suicide bombings that brought Netanyahu to
office; now, having engaged reluctantly (and damagingly late) in
the Oslo and Wye procedures, his government looks on the verge of
collapse thanks to right-wing desertions.
</P>
<P>
   The side that must give up most if a durable peace is to be
found _ Israel _ remains profoundly unwilling to do so.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say nothing has altered. Palestinians do not
govern most of ``their'' land, but nearly all Palestinians are
under their aegis.
</P>
<P>
   And although the result is more of a patchwork than a country,
Netanyahu talks of a Palestinian state in terms that he would have
denounced as treason five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is change overdue only among Israelis. Palestinians and
their media are readier to vilify them than the other way about;
Palestinian hate is a barrier to peace, like Israeli contempt, and
uglier.
</P>
<P>
   However, the onus is inevitably on Israel, for it is Israel that
rules. It is Israel that since 1967 has occupied another people's
homeland, making changes _ after Oslo almost as before _ that may
yet render real peace unreachable.
</P>
<P>
   It has walled off Arab east Jerusalem with Jewish suburbs. It
has colonized the West Bank, under rules that allow any Israeli, be
he newly arrived from Omsk or Alaska, to settle, while exiled
Palestinians whose family may have lived there for centuries
cannot. Even now it confiscates Palestinian land and water.
</P>
<P>
   All this is natural enough in a people with Jewish history
behind it, and in a state whose neighbors long denied its right
even to exist.
</P>
<P>
   And it does require a leap of faith to believe that the
Palestinians, with no democratic history, few resources, fledgling
institutions and at least as many fundamentalist hotheads as Israel
itself, will quickly be capable of assuring the security of their
future state, let alone Israel's.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that is just what has to occur. President Clinton's task _
and no one should envy him it _ must be to help persuade Israelis
to make that leap. &QL;

violence, some of them _ to find that a promised release of
Palestinian prisoners in practice meant more common criminals than
of the 2,000-odd political prisoners held by Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli government replied last week that freeing people
``with blood on their hands,'' or Hamas members, was no part of
Wye, and that it would stop implementing the accord unless the
Palestinian Authority admitted as much, halted and punished
violence and incitement to it, and renounced Arafat's threat to
declare a Palestinian state next May whether Israel agreed or not.
</P>
<P>
   Such roadblocks are removable; Arafat went halfway on Dec. 6,
talking only of ``agreement'' on a Palestinian state, not of a
unilateral declaration if none could be reached. But the spirit
that sets roadblocks up is far harder to shift.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the five years since Oslo, Palestinians gravely doubt
that Rabin's current successor (and old opponent), Benjamin
Netanyahu, really wants peace at all; and he does not trust them to
mean peace when they say it.
</P>
<P>
   Next May was supposed _ hence Arafat's deadline _ to see the end
of the ``final-status'' negotiations. They have not yet begun.
</P>
<P>
   Why not? The straightforward answer is that things were always
bound to get bad and bitter as the final-status talks, and the
really hard issues such as Jerusalem grew nearer, and neither side
was ever likely to be in a hurry to grapple with those decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are other answers too, which make a normal
deadlines-concentrate-the-mind optimism hard to share.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, in particular, has dragged its feet, though not without
reason: more Israelis have been killed by terrorism since Oslo than
before it, and Arafat is widely blamed for failing to prevent such
outrages by Hamas and others.
</P>
<P>
   It was shock at suicide bombings that brought Netanyahu to
office; now, having engaged reluctantly (and damagingly late) in
the Oslo and Wye procedures, his government looks on the verge of
collapse thanks to right-wing desertions.
</P>
<P>
   The side that must give up most if a durable peace is to be
found _ Israel _ remains profoundly unwilling to do so.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say nothing has altered. Palestinians do not
govern most of ``their'' land, but nearly all Palestinians are
under their aegis.
</P>
<P>
   And although the result is more of a patchwork than a country,
Netanyahu talks of a Palestinian state in terms that he would have
denounced as treason five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is change overdue only among Israelis. Palestinians and
their media are readier to vilify them than the other way about;
Palestinian hate is a barrier to peace, like Israeli contempt, and
uglier.
</P>
<P>
   However, the onus is inevitably on Israel, for it is Israel that
rules. It is Israel that since 1967 has occupied another people's
homeland, making changes _ after Oslo almost as before _ that may
yet render real peace unreachable.
</P>
<P>
   It has walled off Arab east Jerusalem with Jewish suburbs. It
has colonized the West Bank, under rules that allow any Israeli, be
he newly arrived from Omsk or Alaska, to settle, while exiled
Palestinians whose family may have lived there for centuries
cannot. Even now it confiscates Palestinian land and water.
</P>
<P>
   All this is natural enough in a people with Jewish history
behind it, and in a state whose neighbors long denied its right
even to exist.
</P>
<P>
   And it does require a leap of faith to believe that the
Palestinians, with no democratic history, few resources, fledgling
institutions and at least as many fundamentalist hotheads as Israel
itself, will quickly be capable of assuring the security of their
future state, let alone Israel's.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that is just what has to occur. President Clinton's task _
and no one should envy him it _ must be to help persuade Israelis
to make that leap. &QL;

<P>
   Just as it was preparing to hang out the bunting for its 50th
birthday next April, the world's strongest military alliance has
teetered on the brink of real trouble.
</P>
<P>
   In backroom discussions, NATO diplomats found they could not
agree on what the alliance was for, what weapons it would threaten
to use and in what circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of the Soviet threat that once glued NATO and its
16 members together, such disagreements have an ominous feel about
them; however effective it has been in the past, nothing guarantees
that this partnership will last forever.
</P>
<P>
   Such existential traumas were successfully covered up at this
week's gathering of NATO foreign ministers. Madeleine Albright, the
American secretary of state, assured her allies that future NATO
missions would take them a bit further afield, but not all over the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably this means the alliance might set off to keep the
peace in the Caucasus or rescue hostages in North Africa, but it
will not be dragged off to fight wars in South America or
Indochina.
</P>
<P>
   Joschka Fischer, the German foreign minister, beat a tactical
retreat after his proposal that NATO renounce the first use of
nuclear weapons was dismissed as unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   Other Europeans, for their part, assured Mrs. Albright that they
shared American worries about ballistic missiles and chemical or
biological weapons in the hands of dictators or terrorists. She in
turn promised them that NATO would never abandon its core function
of protecting its members from invasion.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no room for complacency about the future of a
partnership that was created half a century ago, in a different
world. Perhaps because they do not follow the mood of the American
Congress closely enough, European governments were thrown into a
state of shock by some of the messages they have received recently
from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, American taxpayers have little enthusiasm for an
alliance designed to fight yesterday's wars in Europe. So America's
interest in transatlantic cooperation will be proportional to
Europe's willingness to face future challenges: poison gas, germ
warfare, rogue missiles, ethnic wars on _ or a little beyond _
NATO's periphery.
</P>
<P>
   Such talk makes Europeans feel distinctly queasy. They felt
comfortable with a military structure that was mainly geared to
warding off conventional threats to their own territory _ and where
all the hardest strategic decisions were, and are, taken and
implemented by Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, NATO will not disappear overnight, even if the
Europeans dig in their heels and refuse to adapt. But the alliance
could very rapidly lose its place in the pecking order of America's
overseas security commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from transatlantic tiffs over military theory, there have
also been squabbles about military practice _ especially in the
Balkans. While Americans have longstanding doubts about Europe's
competence in handling the multiple crises of former Yugoslavia,
the Europeans are now grumbling about the tactics of the United
States in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   They say it handled the high-wire diplomacy almost unilaterally
_ and left them alone with the risky job of preparing an
intervention force to stand by, in nearby Macedonia, in case the
cease-fire in Kosovo fails and international monitors there need
rescuing.
</P>
<P>
   To this complaint, Americans will reply that Kosovo would never
have reached boiling point if, at earlier stages in the crisis, the
Europeans had not been complacent.
</P>
<P>
   How much do these differences matter? The practical ones maybe
more than the theory. If NATO ever does break up, the occasion is
likelier to be some real-world crisis than a difference over
mission statements or military doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   No strategic theory will compel a NATO government to risk its
soldiers unless it feels vital interests are at stake; and no
doctrinal nicety will stop NATO acting when it sees a deadly
danger.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo crisis _ in which NATO made a highly unusual threat
to intervene in a sovereign state, because the alternative seemed
disastrous _ shows how far practice comes before theory.
</P>
<P>
   No diplomatic formula can foresee all the crises of the future;
that is why NATO should pledge to respect international law, but
not always wait for a U.N. Security Council resolution, which
implies Russian and Chinese consent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet arguments about NATO's mission, and grumblings about its
practice, as in Kosovo, both highlight an important geopolitical
reality. The alliance will not survive, in any solid sense, unless
Europeans and Americans do some hard, honest talking about their
division of labor.
</P>
<P>
   America will not indefinitely bankroll the security of wealthy
countries whose military budgets are a fraction of its own, and
falling _ let alone if those countries are unwilling to adapt to
new security challenges.
</P>
<P>
   As well as tinkering with institutions, European governments
should spend more money on modernizing their arsenals. This does
not mean vastly increasing their power; but it does mean deploying
firepower more efficiently by harnessing information technology.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a transatlantic partnership in which Europe
pulls more weight can only be developed successfully if Europeans
are convinced of American good faith.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Europeans provide most of the troops for peacekeeping
operations, they need to be assured that America stands ready to
support them with logistics and intelligence and to extract them if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   There is one other, very tangible way in which European and
Americans can demonstrate good faith _ and that is by procuring
weapons from one another, or jointly developing new technology to
cope with 21st-century threats.
</P>
<P>
   With the future of the defense industry at a crossroads it is
more important than ever that NATO governments face down
protectionist lobbies and ensure themselves the broadest possible
choice of modern weaponry and electronics.
</P>
<P>
   A dense network of relationships between defense companies could
do more than any form of words in a summit communique to keep NATO
intact. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   In a small, cluttered antechamber just off the mayor's office,
Richard M. Daley leans forward over a conference table like an
excited schoolboy, balancing on the front legs of his chair.
</P>
<P>
   He is talking about public education. Not all his sentences have
verbs. Some stream off to nowhere. He pauses occasionally to chew
on an unlit cigar. But in the process of making George Bush sound
like Cicero, Daley is actually quite clear.
</P>
<P>
   The key to Chicago's future is keeping the middle class. And the
key to keeping the middle class is to improve the schools.
</P>
<P>
   To no one's surprise, Daley announced this week that he will be
seeking a third full term as mayor of Chicago. He will probably
trounce his one declared opponent and anyone else who enters the
race. He won his previous election handsomely.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, the Daley operation delivered 207,000
nominating signatures to the board of election commissioners, eight
times the number required by law. The Chicago Tribune called this
display ``Schwarzenegger-esque.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Chicagoans are now thinking of Daley as they used to think
of his father: mayor for life. Richard J. Daley ran Chicago with a
rod of iron for 21 years, and was considered one of the most
impressive mayors in the country.
</P>
<P>
   His eldest son has personally picked 19 of the 50 city council
members, filling vacancies created by those who have died, retired,
or (not infrequently) gone to prison.
</P>
<P>
   He has established strong ties to the business community,
precluding any serious Republican opposition and availing himself
of deep campaign pockets.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he has defended minority set-asides for city
contracts. His campaign manager is black; some of his top
appointments, including the chairman of his school reform board of
trustees, are Latino.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is surprising; in political shrewdness, he is
obviously his father's son.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be wrong to dismiss Daley as a skillful
vote-gatherer whose policies would not work without the magic of
the Daley name. This mayor has much to teach America's other
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, if he succeeds in his bid to reform the public
schools, he will do something that no big-city mayor has ever done,
including his father.
</P>
<P>
   Daley's political success was hardly preordained. He failed the
bar exam twice before passing. As a state senator, he was named by
Chicago magazine as one of the ten worst legislators in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   In his first bid for mayor in 1983, he finished third in a
three-person Democratic primary. Nonetheless, he inched his way
back until, in 1989, he finally reached City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he has focused like a laser on making the city a
better place for the middle class to live in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think cities should be dirty and filthy,'' he says. As
he is driven around Chicago, he makes lists: abandoned cars to be
towed away, trash piles to be moved, fences to be mended.
</P>
<P>
   His ``graffiti-blasters'' program has attracted attention as far
away as Milan. Spray paint is banned in the city; there is a
24-hour anti-graffiti hot line; city crews have the legal right to
remove graffiti from private property.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's positive passion is greenery: the city has planted
over 200,000 trees. Pavements have been widened and street lights
replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Even the cynical admit that Chicago, already an architectural
gem, is a prettier city because of Daley's green thumb and
fastidious housekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   But, as he tended his beloved trees, Daley realized that he was
missing the forest. No amount of greenery could stem the flight
from a school system long considered one of the country's worst.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the mayor struck a deal with the Republican-controlled
state legislature to wrest control of the schools away from the
city's semi-independent school board and its impenetrable
bureaucracy. ``I'm the only mayor that wanted the responsibility,''
Daley reflects.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder. The system was chronically in debt; students
performed abysmally by national standards; striking teachers were a
ritual of autumn.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers speculated that the Republicans gave the system
to Daley in the hope that it would blow up in his face. Instead,
the gamble has paid off handsomely for him.
</P>
<P>
   His reform team has deflated the bureaucracy, sacked teachers at
the worst-performing schools, and demanded that students actually
learn things before being promoted to the next grade.
</P>
<P>
   Test scores are up. After years of fiscal crises, the budget is
balanced. The city has just negotiated a new agreement with the
teachers' union, almost a year before the old one was due to
expire.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the mayor realizes where the proof of the pudding lies:
whether middle-class parents en masse will feel happy to send their
children to inner-city schools. Making sure they do is the task for
a third term.
</P>
<P>
   If Daley has the enthusiasm of a schoolboy when he talks about
his plans, friends and enemies know that he can also be the class
bully. Unprepared staff members are often on the receiving end of
his tantrums. So is anyone who stands in the way of his grand
plans.
</P>
<P>
   When the city began preparing for the 1996 Democratic National
Convention, the mayor was keen to have decorative wrought-iron
fences erected along the route most visitors would be taking, at
the property-owners' expense. When some balked, city inspectors
began to take special interest in their properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a patience boiling-point of about ten degrees,'' notes
one observer. And he never forgets an enemy.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, the people of Chicago seem to like their mayor, in
part because of his passion for the city.
</P>
<P>
   He says quite credibly that he has no aspirations for higher
office. His mangled syntax is refreshing; most politicians, though
more articulate, say less.
</P>
<P>
   When your Economist columnist Lexington begins a question, ``One
hundred years from now...,'' the mayor's brow furrows, like a pupil
at the blackboard who knows that a tough one may be coming. But
it's a softball: ``How would you like to be remembered?''
</P>
<P>
   He answers almost immediately: ``Education mayor. That's it.''
Of course, some of those trees may still be around as well. &QL;

<P>
   BEIJING AND SEOUL _ Hundreds of South Korean tourists have been
making the first visits to a long-forbidden part of their country _
the northern side of the world's last Cold-War frontier.
</P>
<P>
   After being bused along roads lined with barbed wire and guarded
by soldiers, they found not much to see apart from Diamond
Mountain. Nevertheless, North Korea expects to collect $150 million
a year from the South for allowing the trips.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Americans too want to visit, and they know what they
want to see: a large hole which they suspect is meant to become a
site for developing nuclear weapons. North Korea wants $300 million
to arrange that trip.
</P>
<P>
   America refuses to pay. Now an agreement by which North Korea is
supposed to freeze its nuclear program could be scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   Amid heightened tensions, the South Korean government is
concerned at what it sees as America's new hawkish stand. China,
one of North Korea's few remaining friends, has called for
patience.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Japan prepares to duck again, amid reports that the
North Koreans are preparing to test-fire another missile (the
first, they claimed, was launching a satellite) in its direction.
</P>
<P>
   America's special envoy on Korea, William Perry, was in the
region this week. While in Seoul, the South's president, Kim Dae
Jung, told him: ``North Korea is at a crossroads. It can either
risk war through military provocations, or open up.''
</P>
<P>
   In response North Korea declared its army of 1.2 million
``determined to annihilate the U.S. imperialists, Japanese
reactionaries and South Korean puppets at one stroke.''
</P>
<P>
   Really? Since an armistice ended the Korean war in 1953, the
peninsula has been divided by a heavily fortified demilitarized
zone, four kilometers (2 miles) wide. South of it stand 670,000
South Korean troops, backed by 37,000 Americans. America has
another 40,000 servicemen in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Most defense analysts think North Korea, with its economy on the
brink of collapse and much of its population underfed, is incapable
of a sustained attack.
</P>
<P>
   Yet incapacity does not mean it would not try. The regime has
always been unpredictable, if not crazy, its remoteness from
reality reinforced by a stifling personality cult built around the
late ``Great Leader,'' Kim Il Sung, and now extended to his son,
Kim Jong Il.
</P>
<P>
   Desperation for foreign money has not made the regime any less
dangerous. Far from it: missile sales have been one way it has
raised foreign currency. It has offered to stop that trade, but
again at a price.
</P>
<P>
   The present controversy is over a 1994 deal in which North Korea
agreed to freeze its nuclear-weapons program in return for the
supply of fuel oil. This would keep it going while America, South
Korea and Japan built for it two nuclear-power plants of a type
with limited ability to produce weapons-grade material.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans now claim to have evidence that North Korea may be
breaking the agreement, by building a giant underground complex
that they believe is nuclear-related.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea's government reckons there is time to negotiate with
Pyongyang. Since he was elected a year ago, Kim has been pursuing a
``sunshine policy'' in an attempt to thaw out relations with the
North. The recent tourist trips are one small, but significant,
result.
</P>
<P>
   Kim has told Perry that North Korea is belligerent because it is
weak. To dispel suggestions of a rift, Kim and Perry agreed to
respond ``sternly'' to North Korean provocation, but also said that
this was not the time for Seoul to give up its policy of
engagement.
</P>
<P>
   Some in South Korea believe the two approaches may prove to be a
useful carrot and stick. But China was the next stop on Perry's
trip, and it has its own agenda. China backed the North during the
Korean war, but some foreign analysts think it understands far less
about the hermit kingdom than many outsiders assume.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly China is frustrated that North Korea's behavior is
giving Japan good reason to take a more prominent role in regional
security. In the longer term, China's objective is probably to keep
other powers, especially (but not only) Japan, from having too much
influence in the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   To justify that, China looks to history: the Sino-Japanese war
of 1894 started in Korea, and ended in a humiliating defeat for
China. Japan also used Korea as the base for its 1937 invasion of
China.
</P>
<P>
   Perry too, however, has a domestic agenda. The 1994 accord is
considered a major foreign-policy success by President Clinton's
administration.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republican-dominated Congress approved funding for it
only provided he could supply written assurances that North Korea
was not violating the deal. Paying $300 million to find out about
the hole in the ground would send Congress ballistic.
</P>
<P>
   Kim has suggested payment might instead be made with
humanitarian aid, such as grain and medicine, and backed up by
normalizing diplomatic ties and the ending of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Such a deal, his officials say, should not be confined to the
suspected nuclear site, but part of a broader package negotiated
with the North to ensure more openness on its part. Otherwise, they
fear, more sinister holes will appear in the ground along with more
demands for money for the right to visit them. &QL;

Jung, told him: ``North Korea is at a crossroads. It can either
risk war through military provocations, or open up.''
</P>
<P>
   In response North Korea declared its army of 1.2 million
``determined to annihilate the U.S. imperialists, Japanese
reactionaries and South Korean puppets at one stroke.''
</P>
<P>
   Really? Since an armistice ended the Korean war in 1953, the
peninsula has been divided by a heavily fortified demilitarized
zone, four kilometers (2 miles) wide. South of it stand 670,000
South Korean troops, backed by 37,000 Americans. America has
another 40,000 servicemen in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Most defense analysts think North Korea, with its economy on the
brink of collapse and much of its population underfed, is incapable
of a sustained attack.
</P>
<P>
   Yet incapacity does not mean it would not try. The regime has
always been unpredictable, if not crazy, its remoteness from
reality reinforced by a stifling personality cult built around the
late ``Great Leader,'' Kim Il Sung, and now extended to his son,
Kim Jong Il.
</P>
<P>
   Desperation for foreign money has not made the regime any less
dangerous. Far from it: missile sales have been one way it has
raised foreign currency. It has offered to stop that trade, but
again at a price.
</P>
<P>
   The present controversy is over a 1994 deal in which North Korea
agreed to freeze its nuclear-weapons program in return for the
supply of fuel oil. This would keep it going while America, South
Korea and Japan built for it two nuclear-power plants of a type
with limited ability to produce weapons-grade material.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans now claim to have evidence that North Korea may be
breaking the agreement, by building a giant underground complex
that they believe is nuclear-related.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea's government reckons there is time to negotiate with
Pyongyang. Since he was elected a year ago, Kim has been pursuing a
``sunshine policy'' in an attempt to thaw out relations with the
North. The recent tourist trips are one small, but significant,
result.
</P>
<P>
   Kim has told Perry that North Korea is belligerent because it is
weak. To dispel suggestions of a rift, Kim and Perry agreed to
respond ``sternly'' to North Korean provocation, but also said that
this was not the time for Seoul to give up its policy of
engagement.
</P>
<P>
   Some in South Korea believe the two approaches may prove to be a
useful carrot and stick. But China was the next stop on Perry's
trip, and it has its own agenda. China backed the North during the
Korean war, but some foreign analysts think it understands far less
about the hermit kingdom than many outsiders assume.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly China is frustrated that North Korea's behavior is
giving Japan good reason to take a more prominent role in regional
security. In the longer term, China's objective is probably to keep
other powers, especially (but not only) Japan, from having too much
influence in the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   To justify that, China looks to history: the Sino-Japanese war
of 1894 started in Korea, and ended in a humiliating defeat for
China. Japan also used Korea as the base for its 1937 invasion of
China.
</P>
<P>
   Perry too, however, has a domestic agenda. The 1994 accord is
considered a major foreign-policy success by President Clinton's
administration.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republican-dominated Congress approved funding for it
only provided he could supply written assurances that North Korea
was not violating the deal. Paying $300 million to find out about
the hole in the ground would send Congress ballistic.
</P>
<P>
   Kim has suggested payment might instead be made with
humanitarian aid, such as grain and medicine, and backed up by
normalizing diplomatic ties and the ending of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Such a deal, his officials say, should not be confined to the
suspected nuclear site, but part of a broader package negotiated
with the North to ensure more openness on its part. Otherwise, they
fear, more sinister holes will appear in the ground along with more
demands for money for the right to visit them. &QL;

<P>
   BONN _ Nothing underlines the German paradox better than a new
debate, even shriller than its predecessors, over the Nazi era and
the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem odd, on the face of it, that the row has re-erupted
now, and so bitterly. After all, it is more than 50 years since
Hitler's death, eight since Germany was reunited. And for the first
time a chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, has come to office with no
personal experience of the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   A country more or less like any other at last? That is what
Schroder implied in his first government declaration to parliament
last month. Germany, he said, had ``the self-confidence of a nation
that has come of age, that feels neither superior nor inferior to
anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   That is also very much what Martin Walser, a 71-year-old author,
claimed a few weeks earlier in a speech after receiving the
country's highest book award. But he went further, charging that,
although Germany had become a normal country, its shame over the
Holocaust was being exploited (he did not define by whom).
</P>
<P>
   Auschwitz, Walser declared before the nation's political and
social elite, should not become a ``tool of intimidation, a moral
cudgel or just a compulsory exercise.'' He for one had learned to
turn away when this part of Germany's past was drummed home ``every
day in the media.''
</P>
<P>
   Walser got a big hand from most present, but notably not from
Ignatz Bubis, leader of Germany's Jews: he stayed seated when
others rose to applaud.
</P>
<P>
   Bubis waited until Nov. 9, the 60th anniversary of
``Kristallnacht,'' when Hitler's thugs smashed Jewish shops and
synagogues, before replying. But he then accused the author, long
best-known as a wry critic of Germany's postwar consumer society,
of ``spiritual arson'' likely to delight and egg on neo-Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the row has been joined by other authors and
editorial writers, politicians and historians; and it has gained so
much in venom that a worried ex-president, Richard von Weizsacker,
begged the participants to ``cool it.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most cutting ripostes to Bubis came from Klaus von
Dohnanyi, a former Social Democratic mayor of Hamburg whose father
was a resistance hero killed by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Would Jews really have shown more courage than most other
Germans under Hitler, he asked, if they had been spared the gas
chambers and ``only'' cripples, homosexuals and gypsies had been
massacred?
</P>
<P>
   ``Anti-Semite,'' snapped back Bubis. He and von Dohnanyi met on
Dec. 8 and resolved some of their differences, but the general
debate rolls on.
</P>
<P>
   Why now? Partly because of the claims now being made against
German firms by lawyers, particularly in America, acting on behalf
of former slave laborers under the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of Germans grumble that the government has paid
compensation enough to Nazi victims already (albeit little for
slave labor). The huge sums being demanded in the wake of those
extracted earlier this year from the Swiss are, they reckon, only
partly justified at best.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Walser did not directly refer to slave laborers,
most of whom were not, in fact, Jews; but, with the claims issue
highly topical, his talk about exploiting German shame struck a
powerful chord and helps account for the force of the reaction.
</P>
<P>
   There is more to it than that, though. Walser was right when he
referred to the flood of material _ television documentaries,
books, plays _ about the Nazi era now pouring forth in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   What a contrast with the drought until only about two decades
ago, when the American television serial ``Holocaust'' finally
brought the breakthrough. Plenty of old people who lived through
Hitler's Reich, whether as fans or victims, find the near nonstop
reminders of it nowadays hard to take.
</P>
<P>
   For the young, though, it is an often-fascinating
semi-historical drama for which they feel little or no guilt. It is
notable, for instance, that they are flocking to Potsdam to see the
first comprehensive show in Germany since the Second World War of
films and pictures by Leni Riefenstahl, a photographer Hitler
favored.
</P>
<P>
   Should they feel guilt? Behind the current debate lurks the
question how to keep the shame and warning of the Nazi era alive
for a generation which did not experience it.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Walser's message is that Auschwitz is a matter for
personal conscience, not oft-repeated ritual that eventually
becomes little more than lip service. Perhaps, but will that
formula do, when no survivors of the Nazi era remain?
</P>
<P>
   Nothing reveals the dilemma better than the long-running battle
over a scheme to build a memorial to victims of the Holocaust near
the Brandenburg Gate in the center of Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Some do not want a memorial at all, many more do _ but think the
current plan for some 2,500 concrete pillars spreading across a
swathe of central Berlin far too intimidating.
</P>
<P>
   A decision was due before the September general election but was
shelved. Now there are hints that the scheme may be dropped in
favor of some sort of link-up with Steven Spielberg's Shoah
Foundation and its filmed interviews with Holocaust survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Stand by for more agonized debate on the past, and how to mark
it, as the government prepares to move east next summer from Bonn
to the old and new capital Berlin. &QL;

   MOSCOW _ When a country habitually lacks people or governments
capable of keeping essential services going, outsiders sooner or
later begin to fill the gap. One word for this is colonization. It
is early days, but something of the kind may be starting to happen
in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The best example is when extreme danger is involved. Take
Russia's old and badly managed nuclear weapons and nuclear-power
plants. Westerners are already heavily involved in keeping them
safe.
</P>
<P>
   American money _ $453 million this year _ pays for monitoring
gadgets at nuclear-weapons sites and for the conversion of
bomb-making material into a less dangerous form.
</P>
<P>
   Another $30 million goes to help scientists _ potentially just
as dangerous _ who might take their skills to North Korea or Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union is spending $104 million on nuclear safety,
including two new centers to train some 1,000 monitors to keep tabs
on Russia's nuclear material.
</P>
<P>
   Other countries have programs of their own. Norway is trying to
salvage clapped-out nuclear submarines off the Kola Peninsula, in
northern Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Finland is spending around $3.3 million on the Sosnovy Bor
nuclear-power station close to it, and is also paying for St.
Petersburg's sewage, which slurps into the Baltic, to be better
treated before it does.
</P>
<P>
   A growing legion of foreigners is involved in trying to help
Russia in other vital areas. Foreign doctors and nurses are trying,
for instance, to stem the spread of infectious diseases. Foreign
policemen have become enmeshed in fighting corruption.
</P>
<P>
   George Soros, an American philanthropist who outspends most
foreign governments in his do-gooding in Russia, supports 4,000 of
Russia's best teachers, as well as such things as book-buying by
public libraries, stipends for scientists, public health, and
retraining jobless army officers.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the most central function of government _ law and order
_ foreigners, albeit for commercial rather than for charitable
reasons, are vitally important.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to be safe in Russia is to hire a western security
company to guard your business and yourself; and to buy western
insurance in case that is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   True, the legwork is usually subcontracted to Russians,
including shadowy figures still on the state payroll. But it is the
foreign ingredient that makes such deals stick.
</P>
<P>
   Where will it lead? The Russian state is withering away. Tax
revenues, in dollar terms, mean that Russia, with 29 times as many
people, has a government budget the same size as Finland's. If the
ruble falls further (and it slipped 10 percent last week), the
comparison will be with Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting hole is filled partly with sheer misery: children
huddling hungrily in unheated, lunchless schools, taught by an
unpaid teacher with tattered textbooks; epidemics of tuberculosis
and AIDS; horrible leakages of dangerous chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Western aid helps a bit _ a few billion dollars goes a lot
further than it used to _ but is a mere blip on a vast, wretched,
dangerous landscape.
</P>
<P>
   It has become plain that Russia's financial woes could last for
many years. That is prompting a big, uncomfortable, shift in
western ideas about it. Outside involvement, whether public or
private, charitable or commercial, was supposed to be temporary, as
it has been in other post-communist countries.
</P>
<P>
   Estonia, for instance, gratefully received western aid a few
years ago, but now no longer needs it; indeed, the Baltic states
are now sending aid to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Few people thought in 1991, when the Soviet Union collapsed,
that Russia would still barely be able to feed itself seven years
later. But the outlook has changed. ``We are looking at a
dependency culture which could last a generation or more,'' worries
a senior western diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides are going to find this increasingly irritating.
Nordic countries, for example, are already worrying that next
winter, as in this one, they will find their sleeves being tugged
for fuel, food and medicine by local governments in impoverished
towns in Russia's desperate far north.
</P>
<P>
   The more Russia gets used to western welfare, the less incentive
it will have to replace it through its own native efforts. And as
the central government seems increasingly less worth helping
directly, outsiders are looking more and more to regional and local
bigwigs with whom to make deals.
</P>
<P>
   Many patriotic Russians do not like the sound of this. It is not
only paranoid nationalists who note that many managers in private
western security firms are former soldiers and intelligence people.
</P>
<P>
   Even quite sensible Russian politicians fear that the West's
interest is to keep Russia as a place from which to extract
minerals and to sell consumer goods to, rather than helping it
become an industrial or agricultural power.
</P>
<P>
   Most ordinary Russians do not yet seem to mind. They welcome the
prospect of prosperity and the rule of law, whoever helps to bring
it. But this creeping colonization will have costs in terms of
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Some historical precedents are striking. In China, for example,
foreign countries in the 19th century took over key ports and ran
them until the 1930s. When western countries ran parts of Russia
during the civil war that followed the Bolshevik revolution of
1917, the result in Murmansk, for instance, was a local ruble
backed by sterling.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of westerners coming in to help run Russian cities, or
even whole regions, still seems implausible. But already Russia's
outlying areas are running themselves with less and less say-so
from the center.
</P>
<P>
   A law on mineral concessions to foreigners is going through
Russia's Duma. Once western companies are granted rights to exploit
Russian minerals, questions of law and order, and who should
enforce them, are bound to follow.
</P>
<P>
   It is imaginable that future investment might be conditional on
customs-free zones administered by outsiders. A Swiss company, SGS,
one of a number offering services to countries that do not trust
their own officials, is on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``What seems unthinkable now may look quite pragmatic in a three
months' time,'' says Scott Blacklin, head of the American Chamber
of Commerce in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Is it surprising that western taxpayers and Russian nationalists
could both feel queasy? &QL;

FEW OPTIONS FOR BLEDSOE'S DOCTORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (s and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The urgency of getting Drew Bledsoe back on the field
has grown each week, but unfortunately his doctors' options have
been narrowing.
</P>
<P>
   First they tried a specially-designed plastic cast. When that
didn't provide sufficient stability they inserted a pair of pins.
Monday they reconfigured the pins and ordered up the one other
thing guaranteed to help Bledsoe's healing if not his team: asking
the quarterback to sit out a week.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors, the team and the player apparently had no choice.
They'd exhausted the only logical treatment techniques and outside
orthopedic experts say the one trick left would have been to try
and secure the fractured bone in place with screws and a thin
plate. But if he'd undergone the open surgery that would have
required, the surgeons agree, Bledsoe certainly would have been out
next Sunday and possibly a week or two longer.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative was to do what they've apparently decided to,
trying again with pins and a splint and letting him rest long
enough to let them work.
</P>
<P>
   Hand specialist Dr. James Herndon and Patriots physician Bert
Zarins examined Bledsoe Monday at Massachusetts General Hospital,
then launched this new course of treatment. The doctors declined to
discuss what they did, but the team released a statement saying
that Bledsoe had had a ``minor surgical procedure,'' and that his
playing status for Sunday is ``uncertain.'' A source confirms that
he will not be suiting up against San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   No one wants to see him out of action, including his doctors,
but there simply are only so many choices for treating a doubly
fractured finger like his. And that list has gotten shorter each
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're trying to keep the fragments in a good position so when
it heals, the finger is fully functional,'' explains Dr. John
Richmond, chief of sports medicine at New England Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   A specially-designed three-quarters cast seemed to do the job at
first, but when Bledsoe had trouble nine days ago against
Pittsburg, his doctors opted to add a pair of wire-thin pins to
provide extra stability. The pins, however, moved out of position
during Sunday's game in St. Louis, either because they hooked onto
something when Bledsoe was slammed to the ground by Rams rushers or
because the fracture shifted and pried them loose.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, ``if they slip out five or six days later
it's a warning sign that they aren't holding, that they aren't
doing the job,'' says Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe's doctors tried Monday to remedy that by revising the
placement of the pins, a team spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The other option open to them, and one they might someday turn
to if the pins don't work, would be to try and hold the bones
steady with a tiny metal plate secured by stainless steel or
titanium screws. ``The screws go through the plate and hold it to
the bone, the plate holds the allignment of the bone, and typically
a splint also is used for some period,'' says Dr. Paul Tornetta,
director of orthopedic trauma at Boston University Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Screws are substantially more stable than pins, much the way a
screw drilled into wood holds better than a nail. But that gain
comes at a price: pins can be inserted simply be stabbing them
through the skin, whereas screws require an incision that opens the
facture site, exposes the bone and requires a recovery process that
means Bledsoe, in Richmond's words, ``probably would not be coming
back for next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Leach, editor of the American Journal of Sports
Medicine and former chief physician for the US Olympic Team, is
even more pessimistic. With such surgery, he says, Bledsoe
``certainly wouldn't play on day seven or 14. He might on day 28.''
</P>
<P>
   And if the screws rip out like the pins did, Tornetta adds,
``there's a big hole there. If you try and put another screw in
you'll need to drill an even bigger area.''
</P>
<P>
   The condition of Bledsoe's finger is topic number one in most
orthopedic departments across Boston these days, much as it is in
homes and offices. But like everyone else, the orthopedic surgeons
are in the dark about what's actually happening because the
Patriots doesn't want its doctors talking, the doctors feel they
have to respect the wishes of their patient as well as their
employer, and the team is trying to keep San Francisco and the Jets
guessing about which Patriots quarterback will suit up against
them.
</P>
<P>
   Several doctors who haven't examined him say that if Bledsoe had
been rested from the time he was first injured against Miami three
weeks ago, his fractures might be healed by now, although of course
the Patriots would have been without his services for critical
games against Buffalo, Pittsburg and St. Louis. Each time another
treatment approach is tried and fails, Leach explains, ``they sort
of start over again. It's not back to day 1, but it puts full
healing a little further along. ... It's not an easy situation for
either his doctors or for the player.''

STOCKS FALL ON EARNINGS WORRIES; MATTEL BIG LOSER 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks fell again in fairly sluggish trading Monday,
pulled down by a host of year-end concerns that are not likely to
be resolved for weeks, if not longer.
</P>
<P>
   Topping the list, according to analysts and traders, were
worries about fourth-quarter earnings. Moreover, few expect the
Federal Reserve to cut interest rates again anytime soon. And
problems in important international markets like Japan and Brazil
are continuing, and developments over the weekend in Washington did
little to clarify how _ or when _ President Clinton's political
future would be determined.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a confluence of negatives,'' said Michael Molnar, a
managing director in retail sales and trading at Salomon Smith
Barney. ``There is no doubt people are questioning earnings growth
at a time when the market is not cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Friday, when the market turned in a mixed performance,
every main market gauge was solidly negative Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell for the fifth straight
session, dropping 126.16 points, or 1.4 percent, to 8,695.60, its
lowest level in six weeks. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index
declined 25.26, or 2.2 percent, to 1,141.20. The Nasdaq composite
index had its worst performance since Nov. 30, falling 62.39, or
3.1 percent, to 1,966.92. And the Russell 2000 index of small
stocks fell 13.21, or 2.1 percent, to 612.55. Three stocks fell in
price for every one that rose on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel, the world's biggest toy maker, became the latest company
to tell Wall Street that fourth-quarter earnings would not come
close to expectations. The company cited cutbacks in purchases by
retailers. Mattel joined a growing list of companies, including
Coca-Cola and Procter &AMP; Gamble, that are facing difficult business
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The earnings concerns are real,'' said Bill Allyn, head of
listed trading at Jefferies &AMP; Co. ``Coke and Procter are companies
that routinely hit their numbers. When these big, blue-chip,
mother's milk companies surprise the Street, there is some
concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Mattel was the most active stock and the biggest loser in the
S&AMP;P 500, falling 8[, to 22. It was the stock's biggest decline in
16 years.
</P>
<P>
   Worries about weakness in foreign markets and economies also
helped to drag down stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices in Japan fell more than 2 percent on Monday after
the release of a survey of manufacturers showed that Japanese
executives are the most pessimistic they have been in more than
four years. And rumors that a capital-gains tax may be imposed on
both foreign and domestic investors in Brazil prompted an 8.5
percent decline in Brazilian stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Worries about continued problems in these important countries
translated into weakness in the stocks of companies that do a lot
of business with them.
</P>
<P>
   IBM fell 5[, to 162~. Another Dow component, J.P. Morgan,
dropped 3{, to 97. And General Electric lost 2], to 86 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks, which were extremely strong last week, pulled
back sharply on profit-taking and concern about the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft dropped 6 1/16, to 127 15/16. Intel fell 4~, to 111
9/16. Dell Computer slid 2 7/16, to 64}. And Cisco Systems lost 3[,
to 80].
</P>
<P>
   Even with the sharp decline in technology stocks Monday, the
Nasdaq is still up more than 25 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, stocks of some local telephone companies fell as the
Federal Communications Commission considered whether to block Bell
Atlantic's acquisition of GTE and SBC Communications' purchase of
Ameritech.
</P>
<P>
   At hearings Monday, the FCC heard testimony from advocates for
consumers and some competitors urging the commission to block the
deals. The mergers are being scrutinized closely because if
consummated, the new companies would control two-thirds of the
local phone lines in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic fell 1 3/16, to 53{. GTE lost 1 3/16, to 63 3/16.
And SBC fell 1 11/16, to 48[. Ameritech dropped 1|, to 56|.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Galvin, chief investment strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin
&AMP; Jenrette, said he expected the market to resume its upward path.
But he acknowledged that concerns about earnings would remain a
factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of every quarter for about the last 10 quarters,
the earnings sinners have spoiled the punch for everyone else,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we get better information from companies that will have
good earnings results, which won't happen until the second week in
January, people will remain impatient. And, if you overlay that
uncertainty with the political situation in Washington, it forces
them to the sidelines.''

 &HT;    Firefighters get clearer vision, thanks to Ohio company, Air
Force
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ With help from the Air Force, a small
Beavercreek, Ohio company has developed a prototype device that
lets firefighters see clearly in blinding smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Zybron Inc. and the Air Force Research Laboratory developed the
infrared imaging system under an $825,000 Small Business Innovative
Research contract. The battery-powered device includes a
camera-like lens, viewer and transmitter, all built into a
firefighter's helmet.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force and company officials dramatically demonstrated the
technology Monday with the help of the Dayton Fire Department.
Firefighter Lt. Thomas LaVielle donned the helmet and strode into a
smoke-filled building at the department's fire training site.
</P>
<P>
   A TV monitor set up outside showed a black-and-white TV image of
what LaVielle was seeing in his viewer. Details inside the room
were clearly visible, as were two other firefighters who crawled
across the floor to recover a dummy and hose down flames licking in
the background.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, LaVielle put his gloved hand against a concrete
wall and left a glowing handprint.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a very clear picture of the whole room,'' LaVielle said
afterward, but he said he couldn't have seen anything without the
imaging system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't imagine you could see two feet in there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not only could such a device help firefighters find victims,
they could use it to find fires burning in concealed places,
because the infrared imager can spot heat coming through walls or
ceilings, LaVielle said.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers and pilots use infrared systems to find the enemy at
night, but this technology was developed with safety in mind, said
Juan Vitali of the Air Force Research Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The initial impetus behind it was to enhance the readiness of
firefighters on air bases,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vitali said the Air Force developed the device because nothing
comparable is commercially available.
</P>
<P>
   Zybron president Evan Zhang hopes that will soon change. Zhang's
10-employee firm hopes to refine the prototype into a smaller
package that adds less than a pound to a firefighter's helmet.
Besides the military, Zhang sees a potential market in civilian
fire departments.
</P>
<P>
   He estimated volume production models would initially cost about
$5,000, then drop to about $2,000 as demand increased.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang, a native of China and a U.S. citizen, sees a wide range
of potential uses for inexpensive infrared viewers based on this
technology. As one example, its ability to detect tiny temperature
changes could allow surgeons to tell living tissue from dead tissue
or pinpoint blockages in blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   But Zhang admitted it's a long step from development to
production. He said his 10-year-old company has developed three
other commercial products based on optical electronics technology,
but it has not been able to raise the venture capital it needs to
manufacture them.

CONSISTENCY, THOU ART A JEWEL _ A RARE ONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB RAY SANDERS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The very thought of helpless, hungry people is enough to turn
the stomach, but the sight of starving children _ thousands of them
with their swollen stomachs, skeletal rib cages and bulging, teary
eyes _ is more than enough to break the heart.
</P>
<P>
   We've seen these sights far too many times in recent years in
places like Ethiopia, Bangladesh, Somalia, Kurdistan, Bosnia and
Sudan, just to mention a few.
</P>
<P>
   Although such scenes are always discomforting, they are
especially troublesome when it is apparent that part of the reason
children and adults around the world are dying of starvation is
because their political leaders (dictators or warring rebels) find
it more appropriate to buy arms and equip soldiers than to feed the
people.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time that war (cold or hot) decimates a people, too
often the rest of the world finds it easier to wait and debate
rather than intervene.
</P>
<P>
   As President Clinton was visiting South Korea last month,
complimenting American and Korean soldiers for their valiant
service along the most heavily guarded border in the world,
Americans sitting comfortably in their living rooms and dens were
shown new pictures of malnourished children in the economically
depressed, but military-ready, North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   We know little about it except that since the end of the Korean
War in 1953, it has continued under Communist control; is still
separated from South Korea by the five-mile stretch called the
Demilitarized Zone; has been a constant threat to its southern
neighbor (actually, ``kin''); and now is in economic and social
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   I've never pretended to understand American foreign policy,
especially as it related to certain countries and continents that
this country never pretended to care about. But I must admit that,
considering recent global events, I'm even more confused by what
appears to be a double or triple standard when it comes to dealing
with certain ``undesirable'' nations.
</P>
<P>
   For the purpose of this discussion, let's talk about countries
known to be enemies of the United States _ countries where we know
people are suffering primarily, or even slightly, because of those
countries' leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Again, for the purpose of this dialogue, let's rule out Russia
or any other former state of the Soviet Union, all countries in
Africa and those in South or Central America. We can even rule out
most of Asia and the rest of Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   That brings us to North Korea, Iraq and ... what's that little
island a few miles off the coast of Florida?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yeah, Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   We have 40,000 troops helping to defend the people on the Korean
peninsula, a place Clinton calls ``the last fault line of the Cold
War.''
</P>
<P>
   Photographs from a U.S. spy satellite reveal that thousands of
North Korean workers are digging a huge hole in a mountainside not
far from that country's nuclear complex. It is presumed that North
Korea is preparing to build a large facility to produce nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has asked for permission to inspect the sites,
but so far North Korea has refused. Instead, the Communist country
has asked the United States to pay $300 million for the privilege
of inspecting the area.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as North Korea expands its nuclear arsenal at a huge
cost, about 2 million people have died there in the last three
years as a result of the country's severe food shortage.
</P>
<P>
   So far there have been no threats of bombing the enemies in the
North. In fact, the president is still extending an olive branch _
or at least an olive ``twig'' _ to the leaders in North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   In Iraq, on the other hand, American ships and planes stand
ready with loaded missiles to attack that country because its
defiant leader continues to divert humanitarian aid from starving
families to feed the army.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the limited humanitarian assistance, a devastating
embargo continues against Iraq _ and maybe rightfully so, but I
doubt it. (Keep in mind, I don't understand American foreign
policy.)
</P>
<P>
   And in Cuba, where an aging revolutionary still refuses to bow
to the Yankees of North America, we impose some of our most
punitive sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cuban families may be getting tired of rice and beans,
no one is starving to death there. The babies are not crying of
hunger, because they are getting their daily ration of milk.
</P>
<P>
   In Fidel Castro's Cuba, precious dollars and devalued pesos are
being used to rebuild a crumbling infrastructure and a ravaged
economy, not to build weapons.
</P>
<P>
   While we encourage our South Korean ally to have dialogue with
its northern kinsmen, we chastise those would want to communicate
or do business with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is time that we treat the leader and the people of Cuba
with at least the same dignity as we treat the leader and people of
North Korea. Of course, I'm probably way off base, because I
``really'' don't understand American foreign policy.

&HT;        LOCAL DELEGATION FLOODED WITH CALLS ABOUT IMPEACHMENT
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Dec. 14, -- Rep. Bob Borski calls in to his office
regularly to check on feedback from folks on whether President
Clinton should be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   When he can get through, that is.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lines have been busy and busy,'' said Borski,
D-Philadelphia. ``We have been swamped with calls. I have never
seen anything come close to this much response in my legislative
career. I think people cannot believe we have gotten this far in
the impeachment process and feel a sense of urgency.''
</P>
<P>
   As Congress members prepare to vote this week on whether to
impeach Clinton, feedback from their constituents has reached a
crescendo in the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional phone lines are busy, the switchboard is swamped,
and folks are resorting to e-mail or faxes to register their
opinion, said staffers for Pennsylvania House lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Borski, who has come out strongly against impeachment, said his
office received 100 calls Friday, and 400 calls Monday. On an
ordinary day he would receive only a dozen. He said the calls were
``almost all'' from folks who thought Clinton should not be thrown
out of office.
</P>
<P>
   But suburban area moderate Republican Reps. Jon Fox, (R-13th
District) Jim Greenwood, (R-8th District) and Curt Weldon, (R-7th
District) who remained undecided Monday, received a much greater
response.
</P>
<P>
   David Lintgen, Fox's senior legislative assistant, said their
office has been flooded with calls. They've also received nearly
7,000 e-mails since this weekend when the House Judiciary Committee
voted out articles of impeachment accusing Clinton of perjury and
abuse of power regarding his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Half are from folks favoring impeachment, and half from those
against impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``People get creative with the e-mails. One guy wrote impeach a
thousand times in all different directions, fonts and sizes,''
Lintgen said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, Greenwood, and Weldon, are among a group of about 40
undecided Republicans and Democrats, whose swing votes will
determine the fate of the presidency. Fox, who was unseated in the
last election, is in the unique position, of casting his vote and
leaving office. Greenwood's office received 127 calls Wednesday,
709 calls Friday, and even more Monday, according to his
spokeswoman Niko Yen, who said the calls were almost exactly half
for impeachment and half against.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never seen that high volume,'' Yen said. ``We are
getting calls from all over the country. I think we get so many
calls in part because Greenwood is undecided. We have so many calls
our office is paralyzed.''
</P>
<P>
   Weldon's office received 1500 calls Friday and Monday, and 600
e-mails over the weekend, said his spokesman Pete Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The response is neck and neck for and against impeachment,''
Peterson said. ``But the congressman is undecided and he must
disregard that and examine the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The level of feedback Congress has received, illustrates the
connection people from outside the Beltway feel to this process,
said Rep. Bob Brady's spokeswoman Karen Warrington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The callers are quite vocal and passionate,'' Warrington said.
``With this, there is not that disconnect from Washington to the
real world. People are calling from row-house Philly to out in the
suburbs. Doctors and industrial workers. Some are calling on behalf
of their husbands, their wives, their neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   By noon Monday, Brady, who is against impeachment, received 180
calls such calls, only 14 of which were in favor of impeachment.
Warrington said.
</P>
<P>
   Staffers for Rep. Chaka Fattah, D-Philadelphia, said they
received about 100 calls, some spurred on by organized lobbying
groups.
</P>
<P>
   One group, called Censure and Move On, has a website that
encourages people to call members of Congress who are undecided.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pundits say people are disconnected from Washington,'' said
Hal Rosenthal, a Philadelphia attorney and spokesman for the group.
But I think it's the other way around. Congress is disconnected
from people.''

 &HT;    State Farm sues for fraud claims
 &HT;    By Earl Golz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ State Farm Mutual went to court Monday to
recover $4.8 million from lawyers and medical groups accused of
staging car accidents to collect claim payments in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits were filed in federal courts in Houston and Dallas
under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law. The
law permits recovery of three times the actual damages, which in
State Farm's case could exceed $14.4 million. Government agencies
also can file criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Department of Insurance is aware of the same type of
fraudulent activity involving staged auto accidents in Austin and
is investigating ``at least one case,'' said insurance department
spokesman Lee Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Perpetrators usually target a new car because it is probably
insured, said Texas Insurance Commissioner Elton Bomer. They
position an auto to slam on its brakes and be hit from behind by
the target car.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, a group of nine lawyers, law office operators and
employees, and healthcare providers were responsible for 199 staged
crashes, most of them rear-end collisions, with fraudulent claims
amounting to $2.8 million between 1992 and 1997, according to the
State Farm suit there.
</P>
<P>
   In Dallas, 16 defendants staged 153 collisions for fraudulent
claims exceeding $2 million between 1993 and 1995, the suit there
alleges.
</P>
<P>
   Though the insurance company has no information that the fraud
rings in the two cities were operating in tandem, it named as
defendants two brothers who are chiropractors, Michael Giventer in
the Houston suit and Alexander Giventer in the Dallas case.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the Giventer brothers could be located for comment
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Other defendants include lawyers and others who operated law
offices and clinics, a ``capper'' who organized some of the crashes
and another person who laundered funds so that intended recipients
didn't get them, the suit states.
</P>
<P>
   One of the accused, Steven Price, a medical doctor in Spring,
also submitted false bodily injury claims based on 28 auto
collisions, State Farm alleged. Another defendant, Slavic Stein, a
resident of California who used four aliases, employed lawyers
licensed in Texas to negotiate settlements through so-called
``Stein Law Offices'' in the Houston area for at least 550
claimants in fraudulent bodily injury and property damage claims
based on 199 collisions, State Farm alleged.
</P>
<P>
   Price's office in Spring said he was not available for comment
Monday. Nor could Stein be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The National Insurance Crime Bureau has estimated that fraud
costs insurance companies at least $20 billion a year and the
average household pays an additional $200 a year in premiums to
cover the cost of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Allstate Insurance in the past two years has filed anti-fraud
cases seeking $167 million against parties who have staged auto
accidents for false claims in California, Illinois and New Jersey.
The company in 1997 was awarded $10 million in California after it
used the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations act to sue
several lawyers and chiropractors for filing false auto insurance
claims.

GOP MODERATES IN HOUSE SWING TOWARD IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's last-ditch struggle to stave
off impeachment grew more imperiled Monday as a number of pivotal
moderate Republicans rebuffed the beleaguered president and vowed
to recommend removing him from office.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden burst of GOP moderates abandoning Clinton drastically
increased the prospect that the House this week will approve at
least one impeachment charge, setting up the first Senate trial of
a sitting president in 130 years.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the surge were several Northeast Republicans, including
Representative Charles F. Bass of New Hampshire, whose votes were
seen as critical for Clinton to secure if he is to avoid the
ignominy of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, several other House Republicans who had announced they
would oppose impeachment were reconsidering their positions.
</P>
<P>
   With no undeclared GOP lawmakers emerging to oppose impeachment,
the developments were ominous for Clinton, who Monday renewed his
appeal for an alternative sanction and set aside Wednesday to meet
with the dwindling ranks of undecideds before they vote on Thursday
or Friday on whether to recommend his ouster.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also suggested that a bitterly divisive impeachment
trial could cause a national trauma.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe it's in the interest of the United States and
the American people to go through the impeachment process and have
a trial in the Senate,'' Clinton said during a historic visit to
Israel and Gaza. ``That's why I have offered to make every effort
to make every compromise with Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton's situation worsened, Vice President Al Gore came to
his defense, accusing the Republican majority in the House of
ignoring ``the wisdom of the American people'' by refusing to allow
a vote on an alternative resolution of censure.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also has begun reaching out to House Democrats for
last-minute advice, as he did late Saturday night when he phoned
Representative Barney Frank from Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Frank, of Massachusetts, is a senior member of the House
Judiciary Committee, which voted on party lines last week to
approve four articles of impeachment charging Clinton with two
counts of perjury and one each of obstruction of justice and abuse
of power. All the counts stem from Clinton's alleged effort to
conceal his sexual affair in the White House with the former
intern, Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Frank said he told Clinton that House Republicans are trying to
persuade undeclared GOP members to back impeachment by casting the
issue as a way to punish the president without removing him from
office. Although the Senate might hold a lengthy trial on the
Lewinsky matter, members of both parties believe there is too
little support to garner the 67 votes that would be required for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans should be consulting Jesse Ventura,'' Frank
said in an interview, referring to the Minnesota governor-elect who
is a former professional wrestler. ``They are doing all this
grunting and groaning, but saying, `Don't worry, the good guy will
win in the end.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bass was among more than two dozen Republicans who were targeted
by the White House because their districts solidly supported
Clinton in the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although I do not relish the specter of putting the country
through the anguish of a Senate trial, I recognize that ignoring
the president's felonious acts would endorse his criminal behavior
and set a dangerous precedent for future presidents,'' Bass said in
a statement. ``After sober reflection and much soul-searching, I
announce with a heavy heart that I must vote to impeach the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   The tide rose for Clinton's impeachment as political leaders and
special interests on both sides of the issue stepped up their
advocacy efforts. Amid the burgeoning campaign, the moderate
Republicans turned against Clinton in the face of polls that show
overwhelming opposition to his impeachment. The lawmakers said the
issue was more important than public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the will of the American people should always be a
factor in an elected representative's decision, there is a time and
place for polls,'' Bass said. ``This is not one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The other Northeast Republicans who had ranked as high
priorities on the list of prospective Clinton supporters but vowed
to oppose him were Representatives James T. Walsh of New York and
Frank A. LoBiondo of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot in good conscience allow the nation's chief law
enforcement officer to violate the law without consequence,''
LoBiondo said.
</P>
<P>
   Three other Republicans who were seen as possible Clinton
supporters announced they will vote to impeach him: Representatives
Rick Hill of Montana, John M. Shimkus of Illinois, and Zach Wamp of
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a leading GOP foe of impeachment, Representative
Christopher Shays of Connecticut, abruptly announced he was
rethinking his vote and asked to meet with Clinton before he makes
a final decision.
</P>
<P>
   Shays and many others who were leaning against Clinton said they
have become increasingly frustrated by the president's
unwillingness to acknowledge that he lied about the Lewinsky matter
in court proceedings, as they believe he did.
</P>
<P>
   The White House immediately granted Shays' request for a meeting
and said Clinton will be available to meet on Wednesday with other
House members ``if they believe that would be constructive and
helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the other GOP members who were reconsidering their plans
to vote against impeachment was Representative Jack Quinn of New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The developments unfolded as House Democrats worked privately on
toughening their censure proposal in a final effort to win enough
support from rank-and-file Republicans to force GOP leaders to
permit a vote on the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Without such pressure, the prospects of orchestrating a censure
vote are seen as highly remote. For example, Representative J.
Joseph Moakley, the highest ranking Democrat on the House Rules
Committee, has been searching for a way to force a vote despite
opposition from Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But Moakley has yet to find an opening. ``It's pretty
airtight,'' said his spokeswoman, Karin D. Walser.
</P>
<P>
   In a related move, the three authors of the Democratic censure
resolution, including Representative William D. Delahunt of
Massachusetts, were writing to the Rules chairman, Gerald B.H.
Solomon of New York, to ask that he permit the censure vote despite
the opposition from GOP leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Impeachment was designed by our nation's founders as a means
to resolve a national crisis,'' Delahunt said. ``Instead, we are in
the process of creating such a crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Solomon, who is retiring after 20 years in the House,
has rarely bucked his party leaders and is unlikely to do so as his
last congressional act.

THIS TIME, CLINTON CANNOT TALK HIMSELF OUT OF TROUBLE
</HEADLINE>
   (See also IMPEACH, IMPEACH-POLL, IMPEACH-DEMS, IMPEACH-MAIL,
IMPEACH-RODINO) 
(sw) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Since his days as an undergraduate, his oldest
friends say, Bill Clinton has believed that he could talk his way
out of almost any predicament. He has usually been right.
</P>
<P>
   In every dark hour in his political career, Clinton has fought
back. He has tested the political winds, then assembled political
war rooms to carry the fight to the enemy. Sometimes he has
counter-attacked, sometimes he has changed course. But always he
has been verbal, vigorous, out in front.
</P>
<P>
   Something very different is going on now as he faces his gravest
crisis. He is not talking much. When he talks, he digs himself in
deeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has lost his touch, at least for the moment,'' said a
Democratic senator who is counted as one of the president's
stoutest supporters. ``His timing is off. His sense of what will
fly is way off, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, last week in Washington and this week in the Middle
East, Clinton has turned pensive, wan and remote. His words lack
fire. On Friday, as the House Judiciary Committee was preparing to
approve a first article of impeachment, he ended a televised appeal
with the words, ``That is simply all I can do, the work of the
American people.'' It sounded more like a sigh of fatalism than a
rallying cry from a president girding for battle.
</P>
<P>
   Never a very close student of legislative mores, perhaps he is
simply puzzled by the Republicans' determination to forge ahead
with impeachment. All his political life, he has relied heavily on
polls for guidance. Now his polls and others show clearly that the
American people do not want to see him removed from office, but the
Republicans are paying little heed to the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore said on Monday that the Republicans
should absorb the wisdom of the American people, as expressed in
the polls, and abandon impeachment. The appropriate answer, he
said, ``is censure, to give the president the punishment and rebuke
that they feel is appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   But the president has done little to give cover to the advocates
of censure, and on several recent occasions, he has made a bad
situation worse. His hostile, unapologetic television speech on
Aug. 17, after he had testified to the grand jury investigating the
Monica Lewinsky case, won few if any new supporters and turned some
fence-sitters against him. A speech more fully expressing his
contrition on Aug. 28, followed by several others, helped Clinton's
cause, as did the results of the November election.
</P>
<P>
   Then his legalistic answers to 81 questions submitted by the
Judiciary Committee upset undecided Republicans anew. Several had
hoped he would admit on Friday that he had committed perjury, or at
least that he had told lies in his deposition, instead of resorting
to circumlocutions. He did not, and he followed up with a
declaration in Israel that he would never admit lying under oath _
something, he said, ``I am quite sure I did not do.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that the idea of his resigning had never crossed
his mind. It has crossed the mind of everyone else in official
Washington, not once but many times, so Clinton's statement further
eroded his credibility here.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Scott Klug of Wisconsin, one of the Republican
fence-sitters, said on Sunday that if the president wanted ``to
throw himself on the mercy of the court,'' he must admit guilt.
Rep. Christopher Shays of Connecticut, an anti-impeachment
Republican, but shakily so, said Clinton must say ``he lied and say
he's willing to face the court like any other American citizen,
after leaving office, and be held accountable for his actions.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's statements, Shays said, were unsettling because
they show that ``he still doesn't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is due to return to Washington late Tuesday night, which
would leave him only a single day to twist arms before the debate
in the House begins. He may also make phone calls from Air Force
One on the way home.
</P>
<P>
   But many Democrats, including some in the presidential entourage
in the Middle East, are amazed that Clinton did not curtail his
schedule there to give himself an additional day to try to
influence the momentous vote on the House floor likely to come on
Thursday, which will determine whether he is to stand trial in the
Senate. At a minimum, he could have mounted a more vigorous
campaign to arouse the public to lobby the Republicans to permit a
vote on the censure resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, White House aides explain their relative inaction and
that of the president by saying that a public campaign would be
``inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they mean it would be counterproductive. Certainly,
questions of propriety cannot be the whole answer _ not when
Clinton's entire future is at stake, along with whatever legacy he
may still hope to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those close to the inner circle say Clinton can never
admit that he lied because it would open him up to prosecution for
perjury after he leaves office. But is that really the reason? If
so, the White House must have little faith in the parade of
prosecutors called by the Democrats to testify before the Judiciary
Committee that no sane prosecutor would ever seek an indictment of
the president or anyone else based on the facts of the Lewinsky
case or the Paula Jones sexual harrassment suit from which it grew.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible, of course, that Kenneth Starr is every inch the
vengeful zealot that many in the White House consider him, and that
he would move against Clinton the minute he left office. But many
who know the courts in the District of Columbia doubt he could ever
gain a conviction here.
</P>
<P>
   And even if he could, is the risk not worth running when the
alternative looks more and more like impeachment and a lengthy,
nasty trial?
</P>
<P>
   One former Clinton adviser who maintains close links to the
White House said last weekend that some of the president's
strategists believed it was possible to ``square the circle'' _ to
find a way of owning up to lying without ``significantly increasing
the legal jeopardy later,'' as he put it.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, the former adviser added, is that Clinton will not
accept that course of action, despite his statement on Monday that
he would consider ``any reasonable compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   Some around the president fear that for every Republican who
would be lured into his camp by a frank admission of lying, a
Democrat might leave it.
</P>
<P>
   In his own calculations, the president may have concluded, like
many others in Washington, that 67 senators, the number required by
the Constitution, would never vote to remove him from office, and
that his best strategy is therefore to sit tight and wait the trial
out. But trials, as one of Washington's leading lawyers put it the
other day, ``have a way of getting out of hand, which is why smart
lawyers avoid going to trial if they possibly can.''

ENDEAVOUR CREW PREPARES TO END MISSION WITH FLORIDA LANDING 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Endeavour astronauts on Monday stowed equipment and made
preparations to end their space station assembly mission with a
rare night landing at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle was to touch down at 11:54 p.m., EST, Tuesday at
Kennedy. There was a second landing opportunity at 11:30 p.m., CST,
in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Low clouds and rain could interfere. Mission managers elected
not to ready the shuttle's backup landing site at Edwards Air Force
Base, Calif., unless the Endeavour crew was still aloft Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like a suit up and let's see how things look,'' said
Endeavour commander Bob Cabana, a reference to the bulky pressure
suits they must don while ground control teams sort out the weather
below.
</P>
<P>
   The five Americans and the Russian cosmonaut aboard the shuttle
seemed in high spirits on the eve of their return.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are feeling terrific. We are ready to start packing and
come home, see our families just in time for Christmas,'' said
astronaut Nancy Currie. ``We could not be more pleased with the way
the mission has gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The astronauts stowed tools and other equipment used during
their successful effort to join the first components of a new
international space station. They checked steering thrusters and
the hydraulic systems needed as they re-enter the Earth's
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Endeavour blasted off Dec. 4 with ``Unity,'' the first
American-built component of the new station. After catching the
Russian-build ``Zarya'' module launched Nov. 20, the shuttle crew
joined the two modules and conducted three spacewalks to activate
electrical power, computer systems and communications gear. The
astronauts ventured into the modules to prepare them for more
assembly missions planned next year.
</P>
<P>
   It was a moment NASA and its international partners had been
working toward since 1984 when former president Ronald Reagan
proposed a global science outpost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we looked out the window and saw (Unity and Zarya)
out there sitting in the payload bay, we just kept pinching
ourselves and saying it can't be real,'' Cabana told a pre-landing
news conference.
</P>
<P>
   He attributed the mission's success to teamwork amongst the U.S.
and Russian space agencies, their contractors, the trainers, and
flight crews and planners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have our work cut out for us,'' Cabana said of the
many assembly flights to come. ``It takes a great deal of effort to
pull off a mission successfully that is this complicated, but I
think we have shown it can be done if we prepare properly.''
</P>
<P>
   The 12-day flight's only disappointment was a test flight of the
back mounted jetpacks that will be worn by spacewalking station
astronauts. The device is the only means spacewalkers have of
rescuing themselves if the two safety tethers they wear were to
snap.
</P>
<P>
   Astronaut Jerry Ross cut short a brief test flight during his
final spacewalk when it appeared he was out of fuel. Later, the
electronic fuel gauge indicated he had fuel left.
</P>
<P>
   A valve on the jetpack failed during a 1997 test.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little frustrating we don't have a fully functional
(jetpack) at this point,'' said Ross. ``We will need to pursue this
fairly vigorously.''
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle crew planned to spend its last night of its mission
deploying the second of two small satellites they carried into
orbit.
</P>
<P>
   The 705-pound Mighty Sat satellite was developed by the U.S. Air
Force as a means of testing advanced electronics and power
generating solar arrays. Late Sunday, the astronauts deployed the
first of the two, a 590-pound satellite developed by Argentina and
equipped with experimental guidance equipment, a camera and whale
tracking instruments.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The remarkable divide between the American public
and House Republicans has not budged even after the House Judiciary
Committee's votes last week recommending the impeachment of
President Clinton. Overwhelmingly, people do not think Clinton
should or will be impeached this week, the latest New York
Times/CBS News Poll shows.
</P>
<P>
   The survey tracks closely with those of several other polling
organizations in recent days, as well as with the findings of
academics and politicians who said they had been struck by how
public views have stayed so fixed over so many months.
</P>
<P>
   But one perceptible shift is that the polls found that in
charging ahead toward impeachment, the Republican Party is soiling
its image and is being preceived as driven by partisan politics.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-four percent of Americans, including a majority of
independent voters, said they did not want their own representative
to vote for impeachment, according to the Times/CBS News Poll. And
53 percent said they had an unfavorable view of the Republican
Party, the highest negative rating since early 1996, shortly after
the federal government shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that although most people do not dispute
the accusations in the articles of impeachment approved by the
judiciary committee, only 24 percent want the House to actually
vote to impeach. Thirty-seven percent of Americans want Congress
and Clinton to forge a compromise; another 37 percent want the
matter dropped entirely.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone poll of 653 adults nationwide was conducted on
Sunday and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans don't seem to believe in polls; the only thing
they seem to believe in is impeachment,'' Irene Bump, one of the
poll respondents, said in a follow-up interview Monday. Mrs. Bump,
a Democrat from Jacksonville, Fla., who is a retired grocery store
owner, said, ``My mind hasn't changed. The committee didn't handle
it at all. It was a one-sided, partisan affair. It was awful.
Nobody had a say except the Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Claire Reiss, 62, a poll respondent from Los Angeles who is an
independent, said: ``The unfairness of the hearings and the
one-sidedness of it, and the self-righteousness of the Republicans,
immediately changed my mind to thinking the whole situation was
ridiculous.'' Mrs. Reiss, an engineering surveyor, added, ``I'm
embarrassed to think how ridiculous our country looks in the eyes
of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the polls also show that despite the extensive media
coverage on the impeachment inquiry many Americans are not facing
reality: Many do not quite believe that the House may vote to
impeach the president this week. In the Times/CBS News Poll, 50
percent of Americans said they think Congress and Clinton will work
out a compromise; 32 percent said the House will vote to impeach,
and 11 percent said the entire matter will be dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the face of such findings, leading Republicans insist
that they cannot be guided by polls, and cling to a widespread
belief in the party that any political damage from the inquiry will
have long diminished before the next presidential elections in two
years. And despite polls showing that most Americans want Congress
to rebuke Clinton with a censure, the House Republicans declined to
put censure up for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously in a political system there is some risk in doing
something that is totally out of favor with the majority of
voters,'' said Robert Teeter, a Republican pollster in Michigan.
``The absolute power in this country lies with the voters. But is
the Republican Party going to be forever blackballed? I don't view
that as a great risk.''
</P>
<P>
   While Republicans insist they are guided by principle, many
politicians and authorities on polling said they had never seen
such a situation where members of a party so brazenly resisted the
will of the people. Such a move, many said, is fraught with peril.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results have been amazingly consistent; these are very
solid preferences,'' said Jon Krosnick, a professor of psychology
and political science at Ohio State University. ``It is quite
surprising to see such a striking movement of the Republicans in
Congress going in exactly the opposite direction of what the public
seems to want.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying it was ``tremendously risky'' for Republicans to move
toward impeachment, Krosnick said: ``The Democrats have been
enjoying for 30 years the fact that they have not had on their
record a Democratic president who was thrown out of office. The
attempt here is to balance the scales.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans insist that a move to impeach Clinton would not
exact much damage on the party, at least in the long term, because
they contend that people are not particularly invested in the
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While most Americans oppose impeachment, 57 percent of adults
said they would not be angry if the House impeached Clinton and
sent his case to the Senate for trial, according to a USA
Today/CNN/Gallup Poll conducted on Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It seems clear from surveys over recent months, and the ones
this week, that many people made up their minds about Clinton long
ago and have since tried to tune out the impeachment inquiry. Only
23 percent of Americans said they personally watched half or more
of the judiciary committee's hearings on televisison, according to
the Times/CBS News Poll; 50 percent said they did not watch the
proceedings at all.
</P>
<P>
   While it is difficult to gauge the intensity of opinion in
polls, the survey found that Americans who favor impeachment are
slightly more intense about their position than those who oppose
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Even under the shadow of impeachment, Clinton's job approval
rating stands steady at 67 percent in the Times/CBS News Poll. Yet
an increased proportion think the president should be censured; 57
percent favor censure, up from 49 percent in a CBS News poll last
month.
</P>
<P>
   And Americans did not dispute the contents of the judiciary
committee's articles of impeachment. For example, 53 percent said
they thought it was probably true that Clinton committed perjury
before a federal grand jury; 19 percent said it was probably not
true, and the rest had no opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Republicans' image seems to be suffering the most.
Thirty-seven percent of Americans said they think worse of the
Republican Party because the votes on the committee to impeach
Clinton were all cast by Republicans. In response to another
question, 62 percent said Republicans voted to impeach Clinton
mostly because they wanted to damage Clinton and the Democrats.
Only 29 percent said Republicans voted that way because the charges
were warranted.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that Americans do not like the idea of
lawmakers ignoring their objections. Sixty-two percent said in
voting on impeachment, members of Congress should pay a lot of
attention to what people think.
</P>
<P>
   John Adams, a poll respondent from LaBelle, Fla., put it this
way: ``One of the Republicans on the committee said that they don't
have to do what the public wants, it is what they know is right
that matters. I am extremely disgusted by the stance these elected
officials have taken.'' Adams, 58, is an independent who opposes
impeachment.

HILLARY CLINTON TIPTOES THROUGH PRAISE IN GAZA  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip _ Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has been
hailed here as a champion of Palestinian statehood, walked a
careful diplomatic line in public appearances here Monday, praising
Palestinian national aspirations while avoiding comments that could
be considered a call for sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   But it was clear as she traveled through Gaza Monday that her
seemingly offhand endorsement seven months ago of eventual
Palestinian independence has made her something of a heroine here,
even though her comments were immediately disavowed by the White
House and were never publicly repeated.
</P>
<P>
   She was greeted with thunderous applause as she walked through
the door of the Palestinian National Council gathering here Monday
afternoon. The ovation was repeated with equal enthusiasm as she
was introduced from the podium by Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian
leader.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, as she visited a center for disabled
children and a refugee settlement with her daughter, Chelsea, and
Arafat's wife, Suha, Mrs. Clinton was acclaimed by local civic
leaders as if she were one of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very proud of you and your support for the Palestinian
people and their own state,'' said Hanan Matar, a Gaza City lawyer,
as she welcomed Mrs. Clinton to a workshop on family law and
women's rights. Mrs. Clinton smiled and asked for a clarification
on the jurisdiction of local religious courts in disputes over a
wife's right to work or to seek further education.
</P>
<P>
   In her public remarks here, Mrs. Clinton praised ``the
leadership of Chairman Arafat'' in the peace efforts and the ``hope
for the future'' embodied in building new institutions, both civic
and physical, like the Gaza International Airport that her husband
and Arafat formally inaugurated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But she appeared to prefer stressing more generic themes, such
as the social benefits of spending on higher education for women.
The capstone of her Gaza tour was a session seemingly calculated to
scare off all but the wonkish: ``Women's Empowerment Through
Micro-Lending.''
</P>
<P>
   While President Clinton pushed publicly for further progress in
the peace talks, Mrs. Clinton went to the gritty heart of one major
unresolved problem: the Arab refugees from the Middle Eastern wars
of a half-century ago, and their direct descendants, who remain
virtual wards of United Nations refugee camps. Of the 1.1 million
refugees in 59 U.N. settlements in four countries, about 760,000
live in the Gaza Strip, and they constitute three-quarters of
Gaza's population.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton and Mrs. Arafat visited the most densely packed of
Gaza's eight refugee settlements. Known as simply ``the Beach,''
the Gaza City seafront camp has 65,000 people crammed into 70 sandy
acres of low-rise cinder block, many of them living three or more
to a room. ``I know that for many here in Gaza, life has been too
hard for too long,'' Mrs. Clinton said during her visit Monday,
announcing a modest increase in the annual United States
contribution to the U.N. refugee program for the Arab refugees to
$73 million from $70 million.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's visit and the international attention that comes
with it ``is like a blessing,'' said Ron Wilkenson, the spokesman
for the United Nations' Gaza refugee program. ``These people are so
desperate for a little bit of recognition. People don't realize how
little they have, and how little they are asking for.''
</P>
<P>
   As she did in Israel on Sunday, Mrs. Clinton avoided reporters'
questions about independence and statehood, and her aides again
strove to avoid photographs of the first lady framed by the
Palestinian flag. Still, her itinerary in Israel on Sunday with
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's wife, Sara, by her side and her
tour through Gaza Monday with Mrs. Arafat was seen in both places
as a display of conscious symmetry.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Arafat, usually not the most public of figures here, was
clearly pleased by Mrs. Clinton's companionship. ``Thank you for
witnessing with us the construction of our country,'' she said,
introducing Mrs. Clinton at the micro-lending forum, ``and I hope
you will be able to be with us to witness our Palestinian state.''

EMPLOYEES GAIN PROTECTION FOR FEDERAL TESTIMONY
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal civil rights law protects workers against
retaliation for testifying against their employers in federal
court, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In an opinion by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, the court
said the protection extends even to those employees who have no
guaranteed tenure, and who may ordinarily be dismissed at the will
of their employers.
</P>
<P>
   The decision overturned a 1997 ruling by the federal appeals
court in Atlanta, which held that because such ``at-will
employees'' have no vested interest in their jobs, they are not
covered by a Civil War-era law that permits people who become
targets of a retaliatory conspiracy as a result of their testimony
in federal court to sue for damages to their ``person or
property.'' A job from which a person may be dismissed at will is
not an aspect of ``property,'' the appeals court said.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the court, Rehnquist said the appeals court had
misunderstood the focus of the 1871 law, often known as the Ku Klux
Klan Act. ``The gist of the wrong'' at which the law was directed,
he said, ``is not deprivation of property, but intimidation or
retaliation against witnesses in federal-court proceedings.'' He
said that nothing in the law required a plaintiff to prove injury
to a ``constitutionally protected property interest,'' as the 11th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had insisted.
</P>
<P>
   The limitation the 11th Circuit placed on the law was a
substantial one, because most private-sector workers _ 88 percent,
according to one brief submitted in the case _ have no contractual
protection against dismissal and fall under the category of at-will
employees. Other federal circuits had applied the law more broadly,
and the Justices used the case, Haddle vs. Garrison, No. 97-1472,
to resolve the conflicting interpretations.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiff, Michael A. Haddle, had been a manager for a home
health-care company in Augusta, Ga., that was under federal
investigation for Medicaid fraud. He cooperated with the
investigation and appeared before a federal grand jury, although he
apparently did not actually testify. The owner of the company
pleaded guilty to Medicaid fraud, went to prison, and was ordered
to repay the government $11 million. Haddle lost his job.
</P>
<P>
   He sued the owner and two other officials for conspiring to
retaliate against him in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1871,
which prohibits conspiracies to ``deter, by force, intimidation, or
threat,'' a witness from testifying in federal court or to injure a
witness ``in his person or property'' because of his testimony.
Congress passed the law to preserve access to the federal courts in
the Reconstruction-era South in the fact of rampant intimidation by
the Klan.
</P>
<P>
   In his opinion, Rehnquist said there was a long legal tradition
of treating employment relationships as protected from wrongful
interference, without making a distinction between at-will
employment and other kinds.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   These were among the Court's other activities Monday:
</P>
<P>
   Community Placement
</P>
<P>
   Accepting an appeal filed by the state of Georgia, the court
agreed to decide whether a state violates the Americans with
Disabilities Act by treating people with mental illness and
retardation in institutions rather than in residential placements
in the community, when such placements are appropriate for the
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Ruling earlier this year in a suit brought on behalf of two
mentally retarded patients at the Georgia Regional Hospital, in
Atlanta, the 11th Circuit ruled that the disabilities act required
treatment in the least restrictive appropriate environment, and
that budgetary constraints are generally not a defense.
</P>
<P>
   In its appeal, Olmstead vs. L.C., No. 98-536, Georgia is arguing
not only that the appeals court misinterpreted the 1990 law but
that, if the interpretation is correct, Congress exceeded its
enforcement authority. This case could produce the court's second
major ruling under the disabilities act; last year, the justices
examined the law's definition of disability and held that people
with nonsymptomatic HIV infection were protected against
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Ex Post Facto Laws
</P>
<P>
   Without comment, the court turned down appeals by the state of
Kansas from two rulings invalidating new approaches to giving state
prison inmates credit toward early release on the basis of good
behavior. In both cases, Kansas appellate courts ruled that the new
regulations, imposing stiffer requirements on the inmates by
changing the rules after the inmates began serving their sentences,
amounted to unconstitutional ex post facto laws.
</P>
<P>
   One of the regulations invalidated by the Kansas Supreme Court
required inmates convicted of sex offenses to participate in a
``sex abuse treatment program'' as a condition of accumulating
``good-time credits'' toward parole eligibility. The regulation was
challenged by two inmates who had previously been able to earn
good-time credits merely by staying out of trouble, and who refused
to participate in the treatment program because it required
accepting responsibility for their crimes while their cases were
still on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six states joined Kansas in appealing the state court
ruling, which the states argued would deprive prison administrators
of the ``necessary administrative flexibility'' to take advantage
of ``a host of new medical and sociological theories.'' The cases
were McKune vs. Steltzlen, No. 98-366, and Hannigan vs. Stansbury,
No. 98-367.

<P>
   Mattel Inc., the world's largest toy maker, announced Monday
that it planned to acquire the Learning Co. in a $3.8 billion stock
deal that would position the company as a leader in the high-growth
market for software.
</P>
<P>
   But Mattel also warned investors to expect disappointing
financial results for the fourth quarter and the year, sending its
shares tumbling nearly 27 percent, or $8.125, to $22. That was a
52-week low for the stock, which was the most actively traded issue
Monday on the Big Board. Shares of the Learning Co. fell $3.3125,
to $25. The deal, based on a value of $33 a share, could be in
jeopardy if Mattel's price continues to slide or fails to rebound,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   While shareholders typically cheer news that a company is
broadening its product line and is thinking ahead, Monday's news of
the bleak financial outlook ``is so disappointing that it is really
hard to say what it means for the deal,'' said Martin Romm, who
follows Mattel for Credit Suisse First Boston. He said continued
stock volatility could threaten the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a decline in orders from large retailers, Mattel, the
maker of Barbie and Hot Wheels, said its revenue would be flat and
earnings would be significantly below projections. ``This situation
is very painful and disappointing for us,'' said Jill Barad,
chairwoman and chief executive of Mattel, which is based in El
Segundo, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Acquiring the Learning Co., the nation's top maker of
educational programming, would significantly increase Mattel's
competitiveness in software by combining Mattel's strengths in
research and development, distribution and purchasing with the
other company's expertise in software development. The Learning
Co., with projected 1998 revenue of $850 million, is the world's
second-largest independent maker of consumer software, after
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   If the combination goes through, consumers might see, for
instance, Mattel's popular Tickle Me Elmo doll transformed into a
tutor on CD-ROM or the Learning Co.'s Reader Rabbit animated
character developed into a plush toy with the electronic brains to
read to children or teach them the alphabet.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, consumers would be likely to see faster delivery of
new educational and entertainment programs at competitive prices in
more stores, toy industry analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will mean more selection, better distribution and more
traditional Mattel toys delivered via software,'' said Tim
Ghriskey, senior portfolio manager at the Dreyfus Corp., which
owned 191,200 shares of Mattel in September but has sold its stake.
</P>
<P>
   Educational and entertainment software is becoming increasingly
important in the $22 billion toy market, as manufacturers seek ways
to retain young consumers who are shoving traditional board games
and action figures to the back of the toy chest in favor of
action-packed electronic alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   While sales of traditional toys declined 0.6 percent this year
through October, revenue in the $1.8 billion category of education
and entertainment software rose 4 percent, according to the NPD
Group.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Some kids are now abandoning toys early and getting into
computers at earlier ages,'' said Gene Gilligan, executive editor
of Playthings magazine, a trade publication, and toy companies are
responding by moving ``products into some of these high-tech
areas.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Learning Co. deal, Mattel would have $1 billion in
software sales and an edge in electronic products over Hasbro Inc.,
the No. 2 toy maker. Hasbro has also been strengthening its
position in high technology, recently acquiring the software game
manufacturer Microprose Inc. and Tiger Electronics, the maker of
Furby, this holiday season's must-have toy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Together we have the engine and the content to redefine
leadership in the interactive world,'' said Michael Perik, chairman
and chief executive of the Learning Co., which is based in
Cambridge, Mass. He will join Mattel's management team. The deal
has been approved by the boards of both companies, but remains
subject to regulatory and shareholder approval.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing its bleak financial news, Mattel said it had been
hurt by decreased sales from several retailers, including Toys
``R'' Us, which has halved its inventory of Mattel products this
year as it tries to improve its own poor performance. ``This has
negatively impacted our sales by approximately $350 million this
year,'' Ms. Barad said of the cutbacks by the retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding its troubles, Mattel said that it had switched to
just-in-time product shipment to manage inventory better, but that
the move would reduce sales by an additional $150 million this
year. ``Given this $500 million revenue decline, we expect our 1998
sales to be flat with last year,'' she said. The company had
revenue of $4.84 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel now expects earnings for the year to be about $1.20 a
share before a one-time charge, a 33 percent decline from the
company's previous estimate. The analysts' estimate on annual
earnings had been $1.78 a share, according to a poll by First Call.
Earnings in the previous year were $1.65.
</P>
<P>
   ``The magnitude of the problem in terms of the write-downs taken
to move inventory did catch a lot of investors off guard,'' said
David Leibowitz, an analyst at Burnham Securities.

CLINTON STIRS PALESTINIANS WITH NOD TO STATEHOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By JAMES BENNET 
  
 1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip _ It certainly seemed like a state visit.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, some members of the honor guard that greeted President
Clinton at the Gaza International Airport Monday morning did not
always march precisely in step.
</P>
<P>
   And no, the band did not attempt ``The Star Spangled Banner'' on
its drums, bagpipes and saxophones, contenting itself instead with
a peppy rendition of ``The Happy Wanderer.''
</P>
<P>
   But from the immense U.S. and Palestinian flags draped from the
airport's control tower to the joint appearance by two leaders at
which reporters shouted questions about impeachment, the day had
all the feel of a typical visit by Clinton to a foreign state.
</P>
<P>
   Yet one thing, of course, was missing: the state.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration said it had no intention of signaling
recognition of Palestinian sovereignty with the president's
eight-and-a-half-hour visit, in careful deference to the
president's Middle East policy and to Israeli sensibilities. But
Clinton came mighty close, and his aides acknowledged that he had
given the notion of statehood a shove.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am profoundly honored to be the first American president to
address the Palestinian people in a city governed by
Palestinians,'' he told a meeting of the Palestine National Council
and other leaders Monday evening. He said that ``this moment would
have been inconceivable a decade ago.''
</P>
<P>
   In a further sign of how times have changed, a senior
administration official said Monday night that he did not know if
the audience _ a lustily cheering throng of about 700, mostly men
in suits _ included any suspects wanted by the United States. And
he did not seem much interested.
</P>
<P>
   Acceding to a formal request from the Israelis, Clinton did not
fly Air Force One into the newly opened airport here. But the six
helicopters and the cloud of tan dust that he and his delegation
rode in on nevertheless made for an impressive sight. He was
greeted by the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, for a day of
ceremony, meetings, eating and speechifying.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians skipped work and were released from elementary
school and college classes to line the dusty roads here in hopes of
catching a glimpse of the president, who mostly traveled over their
heads in his green-and-white Blackhawk helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and Palestinian flags fluttered everywhere in the cool
southerly breeze, and Clinton, with one thumb upthrust and Arafat
at his side, smiled out from ubiquitous posters.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton accepted a gift of a Koran from Arafat and joked with
associates about overindulging in a lunch of rice, lamb and three
kinds of fish.
</P>
<P>
   Some Palestinians seized on the visit as evidence that they were
approaching statehood, if they had not already arrived. As he
fingered his prayer beads while waiting at the airport for Clinton,
Nadshe Mustafa, the mayor of Hebron, said: ``This is a very
important day in Palestinian history, that the president of the
United States comes to Palestine. We consider it a recognition of
the Palestinian state.''
</P>
<P>
   Abu Jabal, 50, said he had decided not to go to his job in
Israel today. ``This is an important historic event, a crucial
historic moment that I decided I needed to see with my own eyes,''
he said. ``I may lose a day's pay, but it's worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   From the dirt roads to the crumbling office buildings by the
Mediterranean Sea, signs abound here that prosperity, like
statehood, may be a ways off. In remarks Monday evening, Arafat
laid the blame at the feet of the Israelis, who he said had ``left
behind a devastated infrastructure.'' But he proclaimed ``the
resurrection of Palestine'' under way.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's speech preceded a vote by show of hands of the
Palestinian leadership to renounce clauses in their charter that
were obnoxious to Israel. Clinton then addressed the group.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Palestinians, the president's equally delighted aides
repeatedly resorted to the word historic to describe his visit.
``In many ways, at many levels, the president got done what we came
here to do,'' said Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security
adviser, referring to the three-day trip to the region that ends
after a visit to Bethlehem and Masada on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Berger denied that Monday's visit amounted to recognition of a
Palestinian state, an issue that the Israelis and Palestinians are
supposed to negotiate. But he added: ``Does the president coming
here by agreement between Israel and the Palestinians give some
legitimacy to the Palestinian people? I think it does.''

VOTERS' OPINIONS ASIDE, REPUBLICAN SUPPORT FOR IMPEACHMENT GELS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the House vote on impeachment drew closer, the
ranks of Republicans supporting President Clinton's impeachment
grew Monday and, in a more ominous sign for the White House, some
of the few Republicans who have been on the record against the
impeachment drive began to waver.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican votes for impeachment continued to solidify
despite a remarkable stability in public opinion. Sixty-four
percent of Americans, including a majority of independent voters,
said they did not want their representatives to vote for
impeachment, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll
conducted Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that while most voters do not dispute the
accusations of perjury, obstruction of justice and abuse of power
outlined in the articles of impeachment approved by the House
Judiciary Committee, only 24 percent want the House to actually
vote to impeach Clinton. Another 37 percent of Americans want
Congress and Clinton to work out a compromise; 37 percent want the
matter dropped entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to escape questions about the fate of his Presidency as
he continued a Middle East peace-making mission, Clinton said that
he was open to ``any reasonable compromise'' short of impeachment.
``I don't believe it's in the interest of the United States and the
American people to go through the impeachment process and have a
trial in the Senate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But with the White House increasingly pessimistic about the
President's ability to win the vote in the House, Vice President Al
Gore was anything but conciliatory. He denounced House Republican
leaders for refusing to allow a vote to censure the president and
accused them of ignoring the ``wisdom of the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's sharp-edged comments came at the end of an otherwise
routine White House announcement on a new round of law enforcement
grants. ``It's very unfortunate that the leadership of the House of
Representatives has made a decision to reject compromise and force
a vote only on impeachment, and not give the members of Congress a
chance to vote their conscience,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   His tone was echoed by the White House press secretary, Joe
Lockhart, who said, ``There is a small group of the Republican
leadership who have made it their mission in life to remove the
president against perhaps the will of the House but certainly
against the will of the American public.''
</P>
<P>
   He also raised the specter that a Senate trial could undermine
the economy. ``I'd say that any student of the markets will say
that uncertainty is bad for the markets,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing that a direct campaign to lobby Republicans would be
counterproductive at this point, the White House and its allies
focused many of their efforts on trying to energize the public and
stoke a backlash against impeachment. John J. Sweeney, president of
the AFL-CIO, instructed union members to use a toll free line to
call the Capitol and press Republicans for a censure vote. He also
urged union locals within 100 miles of Washington to wage a mass
demonstration and vigil on the steps of the Capitol when the
impeachment debate begins Thursday, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson
called for a prayer vigil.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effort to impeach President Clinton has moved beyond
reason or responsibility,'' he said in a letter to union
presidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``People for the American Way,'' a liberal advocacy group, said
it would broadcast 30-second radio spots Tuesday evening urging
Americans to use a toll-free line to call Capitol Hill. The ad
features a couple locked in conversation about impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country's going to be paralyzed,'' a woman says. ``And you
know who is going to suffer?'' Her companion answers: ``We will.''
</P>
<P>
   Capitol offices were already deluged Monday with phone calls,
e-mails and telegrams. The phone traffic was so heavy that callers
to House offices often received an electronic message: ``All
circuits are busy. Please try your call again later.''
</P>
<P>
   And some Clinton allies did try personal appeals. The actor
Robert DeNiro made calls against impeachment Monday to at least two
New York Republicans _ Reps. James Walsh of Syracuse and Sherwood
Boehlert of Utica. Neither congressman returned his calls, and
Walsh had already declared for impeachment this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee sought to stiffen
the resolve of members. They drafted a set of talking points for
Republicans on the committee to use in explaining the committee's
votes for four articles of impeachment. It struck three main
points: that ``the evidence is overwhelming;'' that ``our laws
should apply equally to every American,'' and that ``America and
the Constitution are strong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the height of egotism to suggest that the president's
well-being and the well-being of the country are the same,'' said
one of the talking points.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans appeared to be moving steadily toward impeachment.
Rep. Christopher Shays, who was one of the first Republicans to
speak out against impeachment, softened his position Monday on the
eve of a town meeting in his Connecticut district.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the vote were today, I'd be voting against,'' Shays said.
``But it is not the same kind of certainty I had a week ago. My
certainty has been shaken by the president's failure to come to
grips with his problem.'' He was particularly critical of Clinton's
statement of contrition last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just dug a deeper a hole,'' Shays said. ``I think he needs
to say he did not tell the truth. And he did not. Like all
Americans, he must abide by the laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Shays said he wanted to meet with the President before he casts
his vote. The White House was so alarmed that John Podesta, the
White House chief of staff, called Shays to arrange the meeting
immediately after reading his remarks on a new wire.
</P>
<P>
   One other in the handful of Republicans who have expressed
opposition to impeachment also signaled a possible change of heart.
Aides to Rep. Jack Quinn, a Republican from outside Buffalo, said
he was now undecided.
</P>
<P>
   In the lame-duck 105th Congress, Republicans hold 228 seats. The
Democrats have 206, and there is one independent who usually votes
with the Democrats. Democratic leaders are hoping to hold all but
three to five Democrats against impeachment. That means Clinton
must win support from 14 to 16 Republicans to prevail by just one
vote.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to see how he can reach that number, with only Reps.
Amo Houghton and Peter T. King, both of New York, and Mark Edward
Souder of Indiana still solidly against impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The pool of undecided Republicans shrank Monday, when Reps.
Wayne T. Gilchrest of Maryland, Frank A. LoBiondo of New Jersey,
Charles Bass of New Hampshire and Zach Wamp of Tennessee, all
declared their alignment with the majority for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans were picking and choosing among the articles of
impeachment. Wamp said he would support the articles accusing
Clinton of perjury before a grand jury and of obstruction of
justice, but said he was still weighing the other two articles of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, who were still searching for converts to the
President's cause, said that most of the Republicans who declared
their positions Monday had never been considered likely to support
him. A senior Democratic leadership aide said, ``It's going to come
down to three or four votes but it's still doable.''
</P>
<P>
   The battle for votes is expected to intensify over the next few
days. The House begins consideration of the president's impeachment
on Thursday and the leaders of the two parties were still
negotiating over the time to be allowed for debate. Republicans
were offering six to eight hours and Democrats _ still looking at
parliamentary maneuvers to force a vote on censure _ were seeking
as much as two days.
</P>
<P>
   But even before the critical vote, there were signs that much of
Washington was turning its attention to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In an op-ed article in The New York Times on Tuesday, Bob Dole,
Clinton's Republican Opponent in the 1996 presidential race, urges
the Senate _ whether or not impeachment is approved by the House _
to pass a tough censure measure that Clinton would have to sign. He
suggests that all Congressional action should be complete by Jan.
2.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert G. Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat, said that the
Senate would be operating in ``a legal twilight zone'' with only
one precedent, the trial of Andrew Johnson 130 years ago. He
suggested the Senate could choose to toss out the impeachment case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the first judgment to be made in the United States
Senate is whether a motion will be entertained to dismiss the
impeachment resolution passed by the House of Representatives,'' he
said. ``It would be the legal equivalent of a motion to dismiss.''

NEW EVIDENCE CLARIFIES CHINESE INTENTIONS BEHIND 1996 CAMPAIGN
CONTRIBUTIONS

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a two-year investigation of Chinese political
contributions to the 1996 election, federal authorities have
unearthed new evidence that Beijing's efforts were part of a
broader campaign to obtain access to American high technology,
according to lawyers and investigators.
</P>
<P>
   While still incomplete, the evidence provides a clearer
understanding of China's motivations _ and one that differs
substantially from the initial view of federal investigators and a
Republican-controlled Senate committee _ that China intended to try
to influence the outcome of particular races, including President
Clinton's re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators now believe that the money was intended to enhance
the political standing of those who passed along the contributions
to Democratic causes, to give them more clout as they argued for
favorable policies on trade and technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology was a primary motive,'' said a senior Justice
Department official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   It appears, the official said, that China intended to follow the
example of American corporations, which use campaign donations to
raise the profile of their lobbyists in Washington. Under American
law, foreign governments are prohibited from contributing to
political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators and officials said their new view of China's
motivations was based on inference and evidence that includes bank
records, intercepted telephone calls and statements by witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   While they were sparing in details, the officials said they have
learned of additional links between the fund raisers who arranged
the suspect donations and Chinese executives and officials involved
in acquiring Western technology with military uses. They said the
inquiry has documented more active and substantial contacts between
fund raisers like Yah Lin Trie and Chinese officials than was
previously known.
</P>
<P>
   Another fund raiser in the case, Johnny Chung, was sentenced
Monday to five years' probation by a federal judge in Los Angeles.
Chung had pleaded guilty to bank and tax fraud, telling officials
he funneled tens of thousands of dollars in contributions from a
Chinese military officer to the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign finance investigation began in 1996, when American
intelligence agencies eavesdropped on several conversations in
which Chinese officials discussed a plan to play a role in the
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, investigators focused on the activities of three
principal figures: John Huang, a former Commerce Department
official who became a leading fundraiser for the Democratic Party;
Trie, who is known as Charlie, a close friend of Clinton's from
Arkansas, and Chung, a California entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party, President Clinton's legal defense fund and
Democratic candidates returned several million dollars in
contributions connected to the three men. There is no indication
that the campaigns or the White House knew that Chinese businesses
or government officials were behind any of the donations.
</P>
<P>
   A Senate investigation of the contributions earlier this year
raised questions about the role of the Chinese government, but
lacked the banking records and intelligence information which has
subsequently been made available to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Fred Thompson, the Tennessee Republican who was chairman of
last year's Senate inquiry into campaign finance abuses, was the
first to raise the alarm about China's possible role in the 1996
elections. He initially asserted that the Chinese plan ``affected''
the 1996 presidential and congressional elections, as well as state
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said in a recent interview that he now also believes
that the ``China plan'' was aimed at obtaining American technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were attempting not only to ingratiate themselves
politically but in the process to develop contacts and further
relationships with companies in the U.S. who had the same
technology export interest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of most intriguing new pieces of evidence involves Trie, who
served on a presidential commission on Asian trade policy.
</P>
<P>
   Trie is said to have met in Beijing with Chinese contacts and
asked for $1 million that could be used for political activities in
the United States. Their response could not be learned. One lawyer
involved in the case said investigators suspect the officials had
ties to the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   According to the investigators, Trie told associates he had
Chinese backing. He eventually raised or contributed more than $1
million for Democratic Party causes.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign inquiry is now examining whether any of this money
originated with Chinese companies or officials. Records show that
Trie received almost $1 million from a Macao businessman with ties
to the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   Trie's lawyer, Reid Weingarten, said he knows nothing of Trie's
activities in China.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say they have learned more about another important
figure in the case, Liu Chao-ying, a Chinese military officer and
aerospace executive. Chung, the California entrepreneur who raised
money for the Democratic Party, has already told investigators that
he took money from Ms. Liu knowing that it came from the Chinese
military.
</P>
<P>
   Now, investigators say, they have a deeper understanding of Ms.
Liu's efforts to help Chinese companies obtain American technology
with military uses. In recent weeks, Chung has told investigators
that he tried to arrange meetings for Ms. Liu with American
aerospace companies when she visited the United States in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Liu did not return a phone call to her office in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   There is also new information about Huang, the former Commerce
Department official who became a Democratic fundraiser. Huang
worked as a banker in Los Angeles before joining the Clinton
administration. Officials said he was overheard by government
surveillance discussing political donations with a Chinese official
at the Los Angeles consulate.
</P>
<P>
   Details of his conversation could not be learned. Huang
subsequently joined the Commerce Department as a mid-level trade
official. Because of his previous work as a banker in Hong Kong, he
was barred from participating in decisions about China.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, officials said, Huang obtained at least one secret
government report on exports of military-related technology to
China, which he kept in his office safe.
</P>
<P>
   Huang's lawyer, Ty Cobb, did not reply to questions about these
matters. Huang has not been charged with wrongdoing, but $1.6
million of the $3.4 million he raised was returned by the
Democratic Party because of unanswered questions about its origins.
</P>
<P>
   China's efforts in the 1996 elections came at a time when the
Clinton Administration was relaxing controls over technology
exports and military exchanges with China, a policy that dovetailed
precisely with Beijing's interests. Still, no evidence has surfaced
that Clinton administration officials knew about the covert Chinese
activities.
</P>
<P>
   But some United States and Chinese aerospace companies may have
tried to improperly exploit the policy shift, investigators say.
The Justice Department is investigating three leading American
aerospace companies, and some of their Chinese counterparts, for
possibly illegal exports of sophisticated machining equipment and
satellite technology.
</P>
<P>
   These cases, involving technology that can be used for both
commercial and military purposes, illustrate the interwoven lines
between government and business in China. These same complex
relationships between the government in Beijing and the nation's
aerospace and arms-production companies have also complicated
efforts by campaign finance investigators to untangle the motives
of the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese leaders have repeatedly denied that they authorized a
government plan to influence the American presidential election.
But Thompson said the denials were hollow because they left open
the possibility that Chinese business interests funneled money into
the American political system.
</P>
<P>
   Last July, at the end of his trip to China, Clinton said Chinese
President Jiang Zemin had told him that no senior Chinese officials
had sanctioned channeling money into American campaigns. But
Clinton said that Jiang said he ``could not speak to whether any
people pursuing their own business interest had done that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese military industrial complex effectively reports to
the communist government through a state council that oversees
extensive business operations focused on technology development.
Those operations include the acquisition, legally and illegally, of
American technology, through imports, front companies and sometimes
theft, according to government officials and documents.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is central to the future of China's armed forces.
Beijing's military strategy, once dependent on a huge land-based
army, has shifted to a reliance on a smaller, more mobile military
heavily oriented toward sophisticated computer and other electronic
weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Pentagon report concludes that the Chinese army has
shown ``exceptional interest'' in acquiring and developing advanced
technology, from information and electronic warfare to
anti-satellite laser capabilities and telecommunications networks.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   These Chinese policy goals are central to understanding the
motivations of Ms. Liu, the first person who provided a link
between Chinese money and Democratic donations. She works for a
Hong Kong unit of China Aerospace, which is ``tasked to acquire
U.S. technology by the Chinese Defense Ministry,'' according to a
1997 Commerce Department affidavit filed in support of a search
warrant in federal court in northern California.
</P>
<P>
   In her previous jobs at other China Aerospace subsidiaries, Ms.
Liu helped market sensitive missile technology in countries like
Pakistan, according to government documents and officials. She also
made secret trips into the United States in pursuit of American
technology and was frequently monitored by American agents,
according to the officials and documents.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Liu was not a focus of Senate hearings last year that
investigated campaign finance abuses. But the Senate inquiry hinted
that major Democratic donors such as Chung, Trie and Ted Sieong, a
Southern California businessman, may have been working with the
Chinese government or acting as conduits for Chinese money. The
donors all denied any wrongdoing and the Senate committee was never
able to trace the sources of their money beyond corporate bank
accounts in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   However, the FBI has now been able to go further. For example,
it found that Ms. Liu made payments to Chung's Hong Kong bank
account, according to officials and documents.
</P>
<P>
   Chung told investigators that Ms. Liu told him about her ties to
the Chinese military, where her father, Gen. Liu Huaqing, was the
senior official on the central military commission until last year.
Huaqing personally ordered an investigation into the January 1995
explosion of a Chinese rocket. Later in 1995, scientists from
Hughes Space and Communications helped the Chinese determine the
cause.
</P>
<P>
   But as it assisted the Chinese in its investigation of the
explosion's cause, Hughes provided _ without proper authorization _
technological insights crucial for launches of ballistic missiles
and satellites to engineers working for a Chinese aerospace
company, the Pentagon concluded in a report released this week. The
aerospace company that benefited was Ms. Liu's employer. The
commercial technology transfer ``raised national security
concerns,'' according to the Pentagon report on the matter. A
Hughes spokeswoman said the transfer was properly authorized by the
Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   Chung helped Ms. Liu enter the United States in 1996 by trying
to arrange meetings for her with top American aerospace companies,
according to a 1996 letter he wrote to her.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said he believes there are some striking similarities
in the political actions of the Chinese and American corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that they had any particular motivation at the moment
but that they had lots of motivations to have access and would
technology access and export controls be part of that? Yes,''
Thompson said.

AFTER 6 WEEKS, VACCO ACCEPTS ELECTION OUTCOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ After battling the inevitable for six weeks,
State Attorney General Dennis Vacco returned to his hometown on
Monday to concede to Elliot Spitzer, his Democratic opponent,
declining to say why he had stubbornly fought the results of last
month's election but pledging to cooperate fully in the transition.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer accepted Vacco's belated concession with a smile. ``He
was gracious today, and that's all I am going to say,'' the
attorney general-elect said. ``As of today, it is no longer a
matter of looking backward.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vacco concession came after a protracted, controversial
series of legal challenges by Vacco's campaign, which asserted that
his re-election was thwarted by widespread voter fraud and election
irregularities in New York City. Vacco and his lawyers were unable
to substantiate their allegations, and their legal fight came to an
end on Monday when a State Supreme Court justice dismissed all of
the complaints brought by the Vacco campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Thomas Keegan, said Vacco _ who sought to be named
attorney general by the court or to have a new election ordered _
had failed to demonstrate his contention that thousands upon
thousands of votes were cast illegally in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time has come to bring finality to this election,'' the
judge said.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision paved the way for the State Board of
Elections to certify Spitzer as the next attorney general on
Tuesday, with a lead of slightly more than 26,000 votes over Vacco
out of more than 4 million votes that were cast.
</P>
<P>
   In speaking to reporters and a large crowd of family members,
colleagues and supporters, Vacco did not directly address how or
why he decided to abandon his legal maneuvers to remain in office.
``I've got a lot to say about that,'' said Vacco, speaking in a
large ballroom in the office building that also houses the attorney
general's office in Buffalo. ``But now is not the time and place.''
</P>
<P>
   Invoking the names of his two young sons, Vacco added: ``This
decision was based on what's in the best interest of Alex and
Connor. This was the right decision for them.''
</P>
<P>
   At times smiling broadly and at others tight-lipped and fighting
back tears, Vacco said little on Monday about the six-week legal
wrangling that, at various points, ensnared the courts and
threatened a crisis over whether either candidate would be
certified as the state's 63d attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Nov. 3 election, Vacco has been vilified by Democratic
leaders in the state for his efforts to forestall Spitzer's
ascendancy. In particular, Vacco was criticized for his
unsuccessful attempt to invoke a seldom used state law that would
have police officers conduct door-to-door visits to verify the
voting eligibility of more than 100,000 New York City residents.
</P>
<P>
   He was accused of attempting to intimidate the black and
Hispanic neighborhoods where Spitzer won handily. But that plan
fell through, when Mayor Rudolph Giuliani refused to instruct the
police to cooperate unless ordered to by a judge, which was not
forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Vacco made it clear that he intended to cooperate
fully with his Democratic successor in the weeks before Spitzer
takes office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transition will be like a hot knife through butter,''
Vacco said. ``It will occur in an orderly process.''
</P>
<P>
   Vacco had called Spitzer on Monday morning to congratulate him
and to pledge his support in assuring a smooth transition.
</P>
<P>
   In the Spitzer camp, Vacco's concession drew expressions of
relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``He waged a fight that he believed he had to fight,'' Spizter
said at an afternoon news conference at his law office in midtown
Manhattan.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a brief statement, Gov. George Pataki praised the work of
Vacco, a fellow Republican, and congratulated Spitzer on his
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``During his tenure as attorney general, Dennis Vacco
demonstrated that he has been a fighter who put the best interests
of the people of New York first,'' Pataki said. ``He was a national
leader in our efforts to crack down on those who use the Internet
to prey on children, as well as in passage of Megan's law.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward,'' Pataki said, ``to working with Attorney
General-elect Spitzer to continue the progress we have made in
protecting consumers, preserving our environment and making New
York an even better place to live, work and raise a family.''

`BREAKFAST ON PLUTO': PREDICTABLE AND CONTRIVED 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(jw) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Patrick McCabe's new novel, ``Breakfast on Pluto,'' short-listed
this year for Britain's prestigious Booker Prize, reads like a
hasty amalgam of his best-selling 1993 novel, ``The Butcher Boy,''
and the 1992 movie ``The Crying Game'' _ a movie directed by Neil
Jordan, the same artist, it so happens, who adapted ``The Butcher
Boy'' for the screen.
</P>
<P>
   As in ``The Crying Game,'' we're treated to the rather unusual
premise of a beautiful transvestite looking for love against the
backdrop of terrorism of the Irish Republican Army. As in ``The
Butcher Boy,'' we're given a sympathetic portrait of a perpetual
outsider _ a lost, lonely small-town boy who in this case feels as
though he is looking at the rest of the world from millions of
miles away, from such a distance that he might as well be having
``breakfast on Pluto.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if you put Patrick (Pussy) Braden's penchant for
cross-dressing aside, he might easily be mistaken for a more
innocent, hopeful version of the Butcher Boy Francie Brady. Both
have lost their parents: Pussy, the illegitimate son of a priest
and a young woman, was left in a Rinso soap box by his mother;
Francie's mother threw herself in a lake and his father died of
despair and drink. Both are desperate to reclaim a sense of family.
Both feel estranged from the small-town folks around them. And both
lose themselves in fantasies constructed out of odd pop culture
shards: Pussy vamps to Dusty Springfield and old Supremes tunes
while Francie lives in a dream world defined by comic books and
television shows.
</P>
<P>
   Although both young men are portrayed with enormous sympathy,
Pussy's story isn't nearly as gripping, as startling or as
persuasive as Francie's. This isn't simply because ``Pluto'' lacks
the bloody shock revelations of ``The Butcher Boy''; it's because
this novel often feels as though the talented McCabe were simply
going through the motions. Whereas Francie spoke to us in a
mesmerizing voice _ at once cheeky, nervous and poetic _ Pussy's
reminiscences sound strangely stilted: full of flat-footed and
repetitious observations, garnished with lots of backward-running
sentences and a few campy ``dahlings'' and ``fabs'' thrown in for
atmospherics.
</P>
<P>
   As for the plot of ``Pluto,'' it's both predictable and
contrived. The pages we are reading, we quickly learn, are Pussy's
memoirs, written down at the behest of his beloved psychiatrist.
Pussy tells us about growing up during the '60s in the small Irish
town of Tyreelin. He tells us about dressing up in his stepmother's
clothes, hanging out with his friends Charlie and Irwin, and
becoming the lover of a local politician.
</P>
<P>
   After that politician is murdered _ some say by the IRA, some
say by the protestant Ulster Defense Association _ Pussy takes off
for London. There he starts working as a prostitute near Piccadilly
Circus, and shopping at Biba's for glam-rock frocks. He takes a
series of lovers, some violent and frightening like Silky, who
tries to strangle him; others, doting and possessive like Bertie,
who simply wants to live ``in perfect harmony.'' He even carries on
a relationship with his landlady, who treats him as her long lost
son. In the meantime, he continues to obsess about his missing
parents, searching the streets of London for his birth mother and
muttering dark thoughts about the priest who got her pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Pussy is too busy thinking about his lost family and things like
his ``lovely ice-cream pink mohair sweater and gorgeous black
pleated miniskirt'' to concern himself with politics, but the Irish
troubles keep intruding upon his life. His childhood friend Irwin,
who has become an IRA operative, is arrested, and later murdered by
his comrades for informing. His friend Charlie nearly goes mad with
grief over Irwin's death. And Pussy himself is arrested as a
suspect in a London bombing.
</P>
<P>
   As the pressures mount on Pussy, his fantasy life accelerates.
He imagines a happy family life with his father and mother. He
concocts obscene seduction scenarios starring his parents. He
contemplates wearing a bias-cut pink satin crepe evening gown to
carry out a bombing. And he fantasizes about becoming ``The Lurex
Avenger,'' revisiting his hometown to settle scores.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing terribly compelling or believable about these
fantasies. Unlike Francie the Butcher Boy's daydreams, which
conveyed his desperate need to escape and remake the world around
him, Pussy's imaginings feel like the synthetic extrapolations of a
novelist trying in vain to give his hero a palpable inner life.
</P>
<P>
   McCabe's attempts to open out Pussy's story into a parable about
the Irish troubles (and the inevitable intrusion of public events
into private lives) also feel forced, recalling his lugubrious
efforts in his last novel, ``The Dead School'' (1995), to use the
lives of two schoolteachers as a mirror of myriad historical and
cultural tensions in Ireland. This time, the confluence of Pussy's
dysfunctional personal life and the dysfunctional life of his
country produces neither genuine tragedy nor genuine black humor;
it simply adds a pretentious gloss to what is ultimately a
disappointing novel.  &QL;

 Mattel To Buy Learning Co.  &HT;       
 Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
In a deal that partners Barbie and Carmen Sandiego, toymaking titan
Mattel Inc. said yesterday it will buy educational software giant
The Learning Co. Inc. in a stock swap valued at $3.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Learning Co., which has spent the past year gobbling up
independent Bay Area software-makers like Broderbund, Mindscape and
Creative Wonders, is in turn being swallowed by the world's biggest
toy company.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will make Mattel the second biggest consumer
software-maker behind Microsoft Corp. It also will accelerate the
El Segundo toymaker's plans to produce more interactive, high-tech
toys and to reduce its reliance on traditional retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel Chairman and chief executive Jill Barad paired the merger
announcement with a warning that Mattel's profit would not meet
analysts' estimates this year and next.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the process of transforming ourselves from a
traditional toy company into a global children's products
company,'' said Barad. ``We have known interactivity is the future
and the future is now.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal, expected to become final in March or April, will bring
together some of the most well-known brands in the toy and
educational software kingdoms.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel, which expects sales of its franchise Barbie doll to drop
off this year for the first time since 1976, said new toy orders
from mainstream retailers came to ``a screeching halt'' after
Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   But Mattel, buoyed by strong sales of the popular Barbie CD-ROM
titles, has grown its new interactive business to $100 million in
revenues. With the Learning Co. acquisition, Mattel expects to hit
$1 billion in software &UR;  &LR; sales within five years.
</P>
<P>
   More than that, Mattel hopes to use the Learning Co. as a
springboard to increase direct-to-consumer sales _ through the
Internet and catalogs _ to about $1 billion in the next few years,
Barad said.
</P>
<P>
   With The Learning Co., based in Cambridge., Mass., Mattel adds a
stable of software titles that includes the Reader Rabbit series
that was acquired when SoftKey Corp. bought the original Learning
Co. of Fremont for $600 million in 1995. SoftKey then changed its
name to The Learning Co.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Learning Co. paid $150 million for Novato-based
Mindscape, maker of Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing and American
Greetings CreataCard Gold.
</P>
<P>
   And in June, Learning Co. acquired the best-selling Carmen
Sandiego educational series and the popular game Myst when it
bought Broderbund for $420 million. Just last week, Learning Co.
added San Rafael's Palladium Interactive to the fold.
</P>
<P>
   A Learning Co. spokeswoman said few staff reductions are
expected with the merger, which gives ``a tremendous opportunity to
get the Mattel brand into educational software, sort of a Learning
Math with Barbie.''
</P>
<P>
   All the while Learning Co. was on its buying binge, it was
already in talks with Mattel. Barad disclosed the two companies
began discussing a merger about one year ago, and talks intensified
within the last six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The toy industry and the educational software industry are
almost morphing together,'' Learning Co. President Kevin O'Leary
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to create new products that fit this new vision
where we both think the industry is going. Together, we're already
in almost every home in America in terms of toys and software.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts liked the long-term prospects of the deal, but were
dismayed at Mattel's earnings warning.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel predicted that 1998 earnings will be about $1.20 a share,
far below Wall Street estimates of about $1.78 a share. Last year
it earned 95 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel stock plummeted $8.12 to close at $22. Learning Co.
closed down $3.31 at $25 per share.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel has almost $5 billion in revenues and Learning Co. has
about $400 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strategically it makes sense, because it reflects the
convergence of toys, computers, software and mass marketization,''
said Larry Marcus, an analyst with BT Alex Brown.
</P>
<P>
   But ``the timing, given Mattel's earnings pre-announcement, is
very quizzical. Given the big pullback in Mattel stock, the jury is
still out on whether Learning Co. shareholders are going to be able
to benefit here in the near term.''
</P>
<P>
   Software industry analysts Rob Enderlee of Giga Information
Group said Mattel, along with the toy industry in general, is
realizing ``where the future growth appears to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Mattel's main competitor, Hasbro Inc., has also been building
its interactive division, and this year acquired electronics-maker
Tiger Electronics Inc. and educational software-maker MicroProse
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are still successful independent software-makers
like Electronic Arts of Redwood City, the Mattel-Learning Co. deal
is another step in the consolidation of the software industry into
``more powerful companies that can weather a broad set of financial
storms,'' Enderlee said.

 Schwab Plans to Go North of the Border  &HT;       
 By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Charles Schwab Corp. said yesterday it agreed to buy two small
Toronto securities firms, giving it a toehold in Canada for its
brand of electronic and traditional discount brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco firm will buy Priority Brokerage Inc., a
discount broker founded last year, and its sister company,
Porthmeor Securities Inc., which provides retail investment advice
and investment banking services. Terms were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The two firms will be combined to form Charles Schwab Canada.
Paul Bates, the president and chief executive of both companies,
will stay on to run the unit.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab's expansion into Canada follows previous purchases in
Britain and Hong Kong. Schwab recently said it was also talking
with potential partners in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Schwab dominates the traditional and
online discount brokerage businesses, offering customers access to
their accounts in branches, over the telephone and by computer. The
firm's online brokerage business is surging, with computer-based
transactions representing nearly 60 percent of its trades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overseas markets probably represent Schwab's greatest
potential for growth,'' said Michael Flanagan, an independent
brokerage industry analyst in Pennsylvania. ``The international
markets are relatively less well-developed and have significantly
less competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Priority and Porthmeor will give Schwab only a tiny presence in
Canada. Together they have $120 million in customer assets compared
to Schwab's $461 billion. The two firms have only 28 employees and
a handful of offices, and aren't even licensed yet to do business
in Quebec, Canada's second largest province, and Manitoba.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab is buying the firms ``because they share our philosophy
of offering customers multiple channels'' for doing business,
spokeswoman Marta von Loewenfeldt said. About 30 percent of
Priority's trades are handled by computer.
</P>
<P>
   The firm will open new branches in key cities, von Loewenfeldt
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Schwab probably won't invest heavily to build branches in
Canada and is likely instead to launch a marketing blitz promoting
its electronic brokerage business, Flanagan predicted.
</P>
<P>
   With its population scattered over a vast territory, ``the
geography of Canada makes building a physical brokerage business
difficult.'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Canadians aren't strangers to discount electronic brokers. At
least 11 firms let customers trade stock online.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab's arch rival, Palo Alto electronic broker E-Trade,
entered Canada two years ago through an alliance with Versus
Brokerage Services.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Schwab stock jumped 5 percent yesterday, rising $2.19
to $41.56, partly on speculation that Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., the
largest U.S. brokerage, would buy it, Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Merrill filed documents with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission to issue $15 billion in new stock and debt
securities, a move some Wall Street traders said could be aimed at
building a war chest to buy Schwab.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts discounted the possibility, noting that Schwab's market
value is $17 billion, probably too expensive for Merrill to afford,
Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab's stock has also been buoyed by data showing that trading
volume is growing much faster than expected, boosting earnings
prospects. &LR;

 &HT;    A trip online plus a little savvy can equal a great gift for a
finicky teenager.
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Got any really good gift ideas for the teenager in your life? A
gift so perfect the teen in question will maybe even say thank you?
</P>
<P>
   Didn't think so.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping for teens is harder than shopping for the rest of the
folks on your holiday list. After all, just one dorky gift _ like
mittens or a bathrobe _ might brand you forever as unhip, uncool
and hopelessly out of touch. But never fear, the Net is here to
help you find the ideal gift for your lovable but moody teen.
</P>
<P>
   Smart and sneaky parents are doing their holiday shopping for
teens on the Web. On the Web you can log on, order and log off
before you can say ``Buffy, the Vampire Slayer.''
</P>
<P>
   But for parents, aunts, uncles, godparents and others who find
themselves working without a net this holiday season, America
Online offers a neat jumping-off point called the Giftfinder. AOL
members can access the service at Keyword: Giftfinder, while
non-AOL members can find it on AOL's Web site at
http://www.aol.com.
</P>
<P>
   Giftfinder is designed to guide befuddled shoppers to the ideal
gifts. Users select what type of item they want to buy, answer some
preliminary questions about the recipient, including age, likes and
dislikes, and the Giftfinder offers a suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Brown, AOL's vice president of electronic commerce, says
when using Giftfinder it's important to remember that not every
item is going to be the perfect gift for your finicky teen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tricky thing is you tend to look at the list and go,
`Totally not me,' but if you hit one or two that are right then
it's OK,'' she says. ``The Giftfinder is a great tool and will get
you started in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Another way to divine what teens are thinking is to check out
AOL's teen message boards. One board called Furby: The Greatest or
the Lamest seems to have more ``nay'' than ``yea'' votes for the
overhyped talking toy.
</P>
<P>
   ``C'mon people, we're teenagers,'' said one member. ``Why are
people still into ugly stuffed animals?'' Teens also seem to have
more perspective on Furby madness than many parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ages of the kids who want these dolls range from three to
five,'' remarked one teen. ``So if you can get one, your child
won't even know ...''
</P>
<P>
   The Style message board also offers teens' opinions of what's
hot and what's not all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   From the chatter, it's possible to divine that the Gap, Guess?,
Abercrombie and Fitch, and J. Crew are some of the hottest clothing
shops for teens. So if you absolutely must purchase your teen an
item of clothing, head for the Web sites of these retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Movies and music are sure to charm even the sulkiest teen. Sites
like Reel.com (http://www.reel.com) or Amazon.com have miles of
titles you know kids will love. Reel.com also has a service where
you can rate movies you've seen to find videos you might like.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you really want to play it safe, remember you can
never really go wrong with CDs. Check out CDNow's special section
called the ``MTV CD Lounge.'' Here you'll find MTV's top 20 and
lists of music played on some of the music channel's more popular
shows. CDNow also has a gift registry, which you should check out
to see if anyone you know has made a list and checked it twice.
Remember to check the delivery dates on each site. If you're doing
last-minute shopping online, you may have to pay extra shipping
charges for timely delivery.

 &HT;    CLINTON ALLIES, FOES STEP UP LOBBYING EFFORT

   WASHINGTON _ With only days to go before the historic vote,
White House allies kicked into action Monday, clogging the
congressional phone lines, deluging fax machines and planning a
last-minute prayer vigil to halt the possible impeachment of
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, public opinion polls have shown overwhelming approval
for the president's job performance. But in recent days,
presidential backers have moved to rally opposition to the
impeachment resolution the House will consider Thursday, while
pro-impeachment forces continued to circulate petitions and send
faxed and e-mailed messages to undecided House members.
</P>
<P>
   Mobilizing their response, the liberal group People for the
American Way announced it was spending $75,000 for radio ads in
Washington, Philadelphia and Columbus, Ohio, asking the public to
use a toll-free number to call moderate Republicans in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The group also has allied itself with an Internet effort that
generated more than 130,000 calls to Congress over six days.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who has been Clinton's private spiritual
counselor after the president admitted to a sexual affair with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, is spearheading a public
prayer vigil planned for the U.S. Capitol on Thursday, to begin
just as debate opens on the resolution that could make Clinton the
second president ever to be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of buses are expected to bring supporters from Chicago,
Baltimore, Pittsburgh and New York, said Dina Anderson, spokeswoman
for the Rainbow/Push Coalition, the organizers of the vigil. She
said churches, labor unions and individuals would foot the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Other groups including the AFL-CIO and civil rights and feminist
groups have endorsed the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly alarmed state Democratic Party organizations also have
swung into action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough is enough,'' said Molly Beth Malcolm, chair of the
Texas party, in a message to fellow Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Send Congress a message,'' she instructed in an alert that
included a list of the state's delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio Democrats bought newspaper ads telling readers to ``ask
Congressman Bob Ney (a Republican) to vote to end impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment advocates expressed less urgency, though the Rev.
Jerry Falwell sent out a special edition Friday of the ``Falwell
Fax'' to urge members of his Liberty Alliance to contact undecided
lawmakers, as congressional offices reported a flood of calls on
both sides of the impeachment issue.
</P>
<P>
   At the Christian Coalition, executive director Randy Tate said
his group had no plans for any public demonstrations in support of
impeachment and would stick with a petition drive that began in
October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lobbying this issue is like trying to speed up an avalanche,''
Tate said. He said his group already had gathered ``several hundred
thousand'' signatures on petitions and delivered them to members of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Vice President Al Gore lashed out publicly
at the Republican House leaders for refusing to allow the House to
consider the less drastic measure of censure of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the leadership of the Congress has done is to prevent any
kind of compromise along the lines that the American people want to
see,'' Gore said, in arguing that most Americans prefer censure to
impeachment followed by a trial in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   However, the White House has ``felt constrained in
orchestrating'' an all-out effort, said Jody Powell, who served as
press secretary for President Carter and who is now informally
assisting the Clinton team.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the vice president told reporters at a White House
ceremony that he would not make personal calls to House members.
Clinton has said it would be ``inappropriate'' to make calls unless
a lawmaker sought him out.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the White House had to fight off allegations of
hardball tactics. In an anonymous quote in the Arkansas
Democrat-Gazette, one unnamed White House aide was quoted as saying
that Rep. Jay Dickey, R.-Ark., would be committing political
``suicide'' if he voted for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton press secretary Joe Lockhart told reporters traveling
with the president in the Middle East on Monday that he would fire
anyone who made such a statement.

 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST ORANGE, N.J. _ Peter Rodino, the man who presided over the
impeachment hearings of President Nixon, could hold his tongue no
longer.
</P>
<P>
   Blind in one eye, his vision half gone in the other, Rodino, now
89 but still only semi-retired, sat in front of the television over
the last few weeks without public comment, watching in disbelief as
the House Judiciary Committee pressed ahead toward a recommendation
that President Clinton be impeached, wincing as his name was
invoked, seething as comparisons were drawn between Clinton's
conduct and Nixon's cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Rodino broke his silence. He had said in interviews
before the hearings that he did not believe that Clinton's conduct
rose to the level of impeachment. But now he warns that impeaching
Clinton for perjury will cheapen the Constitution and weaken the
presidency. Rodino, a Democrat, endorsed censure of the president
as an appropriate punishment for what he called Clinton's
``appalling, reprehensible'' behavior and urged members of Congress
to heed polls showing a majority of Americans oppose impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe Hyde has said the country is going to be put through
tumult and turmoil,'' he said, referring to the Judiciary Committee
chairman, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill. ``Well, let's save it from that.
Not just because we want to save President Clinton but because it
would be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his penthouse condominium here, overlooking the Eagle
Rock Reservation, Rodino, still dapper in blue corduroys and wool
sweater, kept reaching for a well-worn copy of his committee's 1974
impeachment report. He need not have. His memories of those
hearings are still powerful and contrast starkly with what he sees
happening in Washington now.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled listening in sorrow, as Judiciary Committee
chairman, to a recording of Nixon instructing his chief of staff,
H.R. Haldeman, to order the FBI to stop investigating the Watergate
cover-up, citing fictitious national security concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lie,'' Rodino said. ``The political intelligence
committees, blackmailing their enemies, ordering IRS audits, the
break-in at Fielding's office, the wiretaps _ these things affected
our rights, our liberties, our privileges. They affected me as they
affect you.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the new speaker, Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La., seemed
to misunderstand the difference between Nixon's offenses and
Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I read that Livingston will turn around and say, `Why
shouldn't we impeach Clinton, when we impeached Nixon for covering
up a burglary committed by others' _ that's not what we impeached
Nixon for,'' Rodino said. ``It's the totality of the many actions
which resulted in grave harm to the republic, which if permitted to
go on, would've destroyed the constitutional system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to consider whether what has been committed by Clinton
warrants that kind of action,'' he continued. ``One has to find
that the system of government is harmed so greatly, so seriously,
as would have been the case had Nixon been permitted to stay on.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than continuing with impeachment, Rodino said, the House
ought to vote for a strong censure, which he argued was ``not
impermissible,'' though it was not specifically contemplated in the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had read with dismay that some members of Congress,
mindful that a conviction in the Senate was unlikely, viewed the
act of impeachment itself as a form of censure. ``If that is in the
minds of some, that we are only doing this as an act of censure,
then we are violating the oath to account to the Constitution,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodino, virtually unknown outside of New Jersey when the
Watergate hearings began, was initially criticized by his own party
for moving too slowly, but won universal acclaim after the
Judiciary Committee reached a bipartisan decision, with seven
Republicans joining the Democrats in voting for impeachment. Nixon
resigned before the full House could act on the panel's
recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Rodino recalled reining in the more aggressive Democrats on the
1974 panel, reminding them that the committee's decision would be
judged by the public in turn, and that the nation might not accept
their verdict if Democrats were seen to have rushed to a partisan
decision.
</P>
<P>
   He said the same standard applied to last week's party-line
votes on Clinton's fate. ``Those members on the committee have got
to be aware of the fact that there were 21 and 16, and there is a
division,'' he said. ``And what do we do? Are we so far apart, that
we permit it? We have got to think about the people and the union
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that the Hyde panel had not taken its duty
seriously enough. ``It may not be that it was a deliberate failure,
but this committee was never immersed in finding out what high
crimes and misdemeanors are all about,'' he said. ``They spent one
day devoted to that.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rodino, now a professor of constitutional law whose occasional
lectures at Seton Hall University's law school in Newark, are
standing-room-only affairs, said his main concern was that a
worrisome new standard was being set, lowering the constitutional
threshold for ousting a sitting president.
</P>
<P>
   ``How is our country going to be governed in the future?'' he
said. ``Is there going to be someone who says, `I don't like how
things are going now, so we should impeach?'''
</P>
<P>
   Rodino recalled ``agonizing and anguishing'' during the 1974
hearings. He said he had been hospitalized for a few days then, for
``nightmares.'' He said he had hoped never to see an impeachment
again in his lifetime. He said the anguish had come back recently.
</P>
<P>
   As one who had lived through the gravest constitutional crisis
in American history, he said, he hoped to make people in Congress
and across the country realize the gravity of what is happening
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that I'm going to change a single vote,'' he
said, falling back into his chair. ``Does this one voice do
anything?''

 Stock Gurus Fear 1999  &HT;       
 By Arthur M. Louis 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Many investment gurus are feeling timid and frightened about the
prospects for the stock market in 1999 _ the Year of the Rabbit.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle asked 10 experts _ money managers, strategists,
researchers, economists and writers _ to predict how 1999 will
shape up for investors, and to recommend investment strategies for
the New Year.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of them disgorged a litany of worries and laments.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly they are worried about the global financial crisis. Some
fear that deflation, not seen on a sustained basis since the 1930s,
could pervade the U.S. economy and sap corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   They expressed concern about how the financial markets will
react as the Year 2000 _ and its dread computer problem _ looms
closer.
</P>
<P>
   And they are bedeviled by the uncertainties surrounding
President Clinton's political fate.
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side, they cite declining interest rates, which
tend to buoy stocks, and the potential streamlining of the European
economy when it switches to the new Euro currency next year.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a summary of their comments _ edited for space and
clarity.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Marshall Acuff &LR; , market strategist, Salomon Smith Barney, New
York:
</P>
<P>
   ``The No. 1 challenge is that because of the global crisis, the
world continues to have significant excess manufacturing capacity.
It will take a while to rebalance supply and demand, which implies
that 1999 will be a year of slower growth. Profits could be down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The types of stocks I'd be interested in are those that grow
their earnings no matter what. Drug and medical-product stocks fit
that description. I'd include food chains such as Albertsons, and
food processors such as Philip Morris. I like defense stocks,
because the defense budget for fiscal 1999 will rise for the first
time since 1985.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; _ &UR; Richard C. Blum &LR; , &UR;  &LR; Richard C. Blum &AMP; Associates, San
Francisco:
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy will continue to slow, certainly in the first half
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going on in Asia is decidedly uneven. Thailand and
possibly Korea might snap out of it sometime soon. Hong Kong looks
like it is bottoming out or even turning around. Japan is still
stuck. China is still declining. Indonesia is still in chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the feeling that 1999 in Asia will be worse than 1998,
but later next year we're going to see turnarounds in some places.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are value investors, and we still believe that certain
companies we are already major shareholders in _ including URS, the
engineering company; Playtex, which makes personal care products;
and Nielsen, the media research company _ represent good value.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; _ &UR; Don Phillips &LR; , &UR;  &LR; publisher, Morningstar Inc., Chicago:
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing wrong with taking some money off the table for
a while. If you've been invested for the past five or 10 years, you
are probably further along the path to meeting your goals than you
expected to be at this point. You might want to move some assets
into something conservative, like fixed-income securities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a fan of stocks in the small-cap and international arena,
both of which have been beaten up quite badly because of the
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Large caps have had the advantage for years, but at some point
gravity will take hold. Still, I wouldn't move over to small caps
all at once, because guessing when a trend will change is a futile
exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; _ &UR; Alfred Goldman &LR; , chief market strategist, A.G. Edwards &AMP;
Son, St. Louis:
</P>
<P>
   ``The big picture, in my opinion, is still a bull market. The
economy will continue to grow next year. Corporate earnings will
rise moderately, and interest rates will continue to decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the Dow reaching a high for the year of about 10,500. At
the end of the year I expect it to be down to 9,500, because
sometime, nine or 10 months from now, investors will be getting the
heebie-jeebies about the Year 2000 problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would focus on those companies best-positioned to grow their
earnings next year. In pharmaceuticals, I would look at
Warner-Lambert; in regional banks, Banc One; in retail food
Albertsons; in general retail, May Department Stores; in
technology, Compaq.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Todd Bakar,  &LR; director of research, Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, San
Francisco:
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the global economic environment, there are
still some uncertainties. It looks and feels like we're seeing
slower economic growth. In an environment like that, what drives
stocks is earnings growth. Technology will continue to outperform
the broader markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within technology, sorting out winners from losers is tricky.
We continue to be big believers in technology services, information
technology, things of that ilk. One interesting company is CSG
Systems International, which provides billing services to cable
television and broadcast satellite companies. It is a strong
company, attractively positioned.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; _ &UR; John Rothchild,  &LR; financial writer, author of ``The Bear
Book'':
</P>
<P>
   ``Valuations in the market are still tremendously high. It's
time to be a little defensive, a little cautious. We can't overlook
the fact that there are problems abroad that have yet to be solved.
I would advise caution, especially for people who need to take
their money out in the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take a look at the classic bear market hedges: utilities, some
of the consumer stocks, companies that offer you a hefty dividend,
in case you don't get significant price growth for a while.
Consider companies like Fannie Mae, the tobacco companies and drug
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another interesting area is corporate bonds. They currently
provide good yields. In a low interest rate environment, with
profits not looking too lively, it might be a good idea to get into
the bonds of solid companies with decent yields.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; _ &UR; Gary Schlossberg &LR; , &UR;  &LR; economist, Wells Fargo Capital
Management, San Francisco:
</P>
<P>
   ``Corporations are beginning to feel the dark side of deflation.
Our economy benefited for a while from the drop in import prices
and commodity prices. But now our companies are feeling pressure on
their profit margins. Price-raising power is practically
nonexistent in some industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to ask yourself what industries and companies are
best-insulated from deflation's impact on profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those that have well-recognized brand names will be best able
to maintain their prices and even increase them. Companies with
strong market niches might do well, because their products are
resistant to commoditization.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; _ &UR; Joe Turner &LR; , &UR;  &LR; president, Pring Turner Capital Corp., San
Ramon:
</P>
<P>
   ``The negatives are pretty well known: the global economic
slowdown, the profit squeeze, which could be a big one, maybe the
impeachment process, Y2K, not to mention the fact that the market
is overvalued, especially large-capitalization stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the positive side is a falling-off of interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most exciting things that could affect the markets
is the Euro currency. It will eliminate protectionist policies and
speed up transactions between European countries. The Eurodollar
could pose serious competition for the U.S. dollar. We could see
more money flowing to European markets. There's going to be real
opportunity in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the United States, we're partial to health services
companies like Healthsouth Corp. and Sierra Health Services, which
are selling at reasonable price-earnings multiples. Energy is a
good place to look for bargains. Shell Transport, Apache Corp.,
National Fuel Gas and Questar are high-quality companies.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; _ &UR; Greg Weiss &LR; , &UR;  &LR; money manager, editor of Investment Quality
Trends newsletter, La Jolla:
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the Asian crisis has not played itself out. There
is a great deal of depression in Asia, and that will have a
dilutive effect on U.S. corporate earnings and a depressing effect
on the U.S. equities markets. We expect a 10 percent decline from
the all-time highs in the first quarter of the year, followed by a
buying interlude, followed by a another downleg that takes the
market 20 percent below the highs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even so, there are undervalued stocks out there.
Archer-Daniels-Midland, the world's largest food commodities
processor, for one. And Worthington Industries, the nation's
leading processor of rolled flat steel, which has a nice 4.5
percent dividend. Another is Ennis Business Forms, whose stock has
been depressed because people claim the business forms industry is
dead, with everyone using laptops and laser printers. But in fact
Ennis is making software for that market.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; _ &UR; Kurt Brouwer &LR; , Brouwer &AMP; Janachowski, Tiburon:
</P>
<P>
   ``1999 will be a year of transition _ probably a decent year,
provided corporate earnings don't slide, but not awesome. Because
the market is quite high, people will be looking real hard at the
earnings situation. Some excellent companies, including Intel and
Hewlett-Packard, are still attractive values.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will have a shorter fuse, and be less tolerant of even
modest, temporary earnings setbacks. We will see more of a trading
mentality, rather than long-term buy and hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we going to have a president impeached? That could have an
impact on investor confidence.''

 Setting Up A Roth IRA For a Child  &HT;       
 By Arthur M. Louis  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; QUESTION: &LR;  I want to set up a Roth Individual Retirement Account
for my son. The law allows a maximum annual contribution up to
either $2,000 or the holder's earned income for the year _
whichever is less. My son does not earn money. Can I get around
that by paying him $2,000 for cleaning his room?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANSWER: &LR;  You mean your son actually cleans his room???
</P>
<P>
   But seriously: No, you can't get away with that dodge. Payments
by parents to children for household chores _ even authentic ones _
won't cut it with the Internal Revenue Service if you get audited.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if your kid starts earning money from outside
sources for genuine services rendered, and can document the total,
he will be permitted to contribute every cent _ subject to the
$2,000 annual limit _ to an IRA.
</P>
<P>
   If he works part-time at the local hardware store, for example,
he will receive a W-2 form at the end of the year documenting his
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   If your neighbor pays him to cut the lawn or do other chores,
that counts too. Ask the neighbor to pay by check. Then, before
cashing or depositing each check, make a photocopy to store with
your tax records.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't bureaucracy wonderful?
</P>
<P>
   Simple IRAs
</P>
<P>
   Q: &LR;  The small firm where I work has one of the new SIMPLE IRA &LR; 
 &LR; retirement plans for its employees. At the end of the year, the &LR; 
 &LR; employer deposits an amount equal to 2 percent of each &LR; 
 &LR; employee's gross salary into each of our IRA accounts. Because &LR; 
 &LR; business has been weak, our employer is thinking about &LR;   &LR; canceling
the plan. Is he permitted to do this? As an &LR;   &LR; alternative, could he
just stop making payments until business &LR;   &LR; gets better? If he does
cancel the plan, can I roll my SIMPLE &LR;   &LR; IRA over into a regular
IRA? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: Your employer can cancel the SIMPLE plan _ an acronym for
Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees _ any time he chooses.
He doesn't even have to tell you that he is doing it, although he
does have to notify the plan sponsor _ the financial institution
that set the plan up and administers it.
</P>
<P>
   Skipping payments is not permitted. Once the payments stop, the
plan dies. However, your employer would have the option of starting
a new plan later.
</P>
<P>
   You might suggest that he set up a different version of the
SIMPLE plan, which would allow him to temporarily scale back his
payments. Your plan currently excludes employee contributions, and
therefore the 2 percent employer contribution is mandatory, up to a
maximum of $3,200 per employee per year.
</P>
<P>
   If your employer switches to a plan that permits employee
contributions, he normally will be required to match those
contributions up to a maximum of 3 percent of the employee's
salary. Three percent is greater than 2 percent, of course. But in
a hardship situation, your employer can reduce his contributions to
1 percent annually for two years during any five-year period.

   &LR; COL. 1 of MONEYBAG () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  It's probably a long shot, but you should at least ask him.
</P>
<P>
   As for rolling over to a regular IRA, you won't be able to do it
until at least two years have elapsed since your employer made the
first contribution to your account. SIMPLE IRAs were created by
Congress effective January 1, 1997 _ so as of today no rollovers
have been permitted.
</P>
<P>
   There is no reason to roll your SIMPLE IRA money over into a
traditional IRA, notes Ann von Germeten, director of retirement
products at Charles Schwab. Both accounts are taxed the same way
and are subject to the same rules.
</P>
<P>
   But rolling over into a Roth IRA might make sense, because
investment gains earned in a Roth are tax-exempt. However,
converting will require you to pay any taxes owed on the money in
your old IRA.
</P>
<P>
   More on Roths
</P>
<P>
   Q: &LR;  I have a regular IRA that I am thinking of converting to &LR;   &LR; a
Roth IRA. I've read about how it would be best to convert &LR;   &LR; before
the end of this year, so I can spread my tax payments on &LR;   &LR; the old
IRA over four years. If I convert after this year, I &LR;   &LR; would have
to pay the tax all at once. But why can't I just &LR;   &LR; convert
one-fourth of my IRA every year for the next four &LR;   &LR; years? That
would spread the tax over four years, wouldn't it? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   But your question indicates that you are forgetting the best
reason for converting to a Roth: Any further investment gains on
the converted funds become tax-exempt.
</P>
<P>
   If you convert your present IRA in annual installments over a
four-year period, you will have to pay taxes on the investment
gains that accumulate in the old account during those years.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that there are investment gains, your method probably
would leave you holding substantially less after-tax money in your
Roth by the time the four years have elapsed.
</P>
<P>
   However, what you propose could make sense if there's a strong
chance that your tax rate might plunge during the next four years.
In that case, you would get to pay taxes on the conversion at the
future, lower rate, rather than at this year's higher rate.

 Oracle, Sun Micro Hatch New Plot Against Microsoft  &HT;       
 By David Einstein 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Silicon Valley powerhouses Oracle and Sun Microsystems joined
forces yesterday to try to derail Microsoft by eliminating the need
for the Windows operating system in some corporate networks.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle, the leading maker of database software, said Sun's Unix
operating system _ not Microsoft Windows NT _ will run a new
computer it is designing for Internet commerce. Oracle chief
executive Larry Ellison called the Sun system faster and more
reliable than Windows NT.
</P>
<P>
   The new computer, code-named ``raw iron,'' could slow the
assault of Microsoft into the corporate market, where powerful
personal computers with Windows NT have been waging a battle with
Unix-based systems from Sun, Hewlett-Packard and IBM.
</P>
<P>
   The new Oracle-Sun computers will be designed to easily handle
financial transactions, inventory control and other aspects of
e-commerce. They could find a warm welcome among companies that do
business on the Web _ many of whom already use Oracle databases and
Sun's computers and operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Although the new computers will be sold only to businesses, they
could result in faster online transactions for consumers, according
to Oracle officials.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle said the first raw iron computers will be rolled out in
March. A source close to the deal said Sun will build them, and
Oracle also hopes other companies such as Compaq and Dell will
offer their own versions.
</P>
<P>
   As part of yesterday's cross-licensing deal, Sun will combine
Oracle's database technology with e-commerce software that Sun is
getting as part of America Online's acquisition of Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts gave Redwood Shores-based Oracle and Mountain
View-based Sun a good chance at succeeding in their latest move
against Microsoft _ especially now when the software giant is under
the microscope of a federal antitrust trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now there's a lot of interest in finding products that
work around the Microsoft monopoly,'' said Bruce Raabe of Collins &AMP;
Co. ``This is a new way to move information that doesn't rely on
Windows at all, and if anybody's going to have a chance at making a
dent in the NT environment, it will be companies like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Oracle and Sun are the same companies that three years ago
touted the ``network computer'' as an alternative to PCs on the
corporate desktop. Ellison turned the NC into a personal crusade,
even starting a company _ Network Computer Inc. _ to develop it.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison proposed an under-$500 computer that could be used to
access the Internet or a corporate network. But when prices of
fully loaded PCs dropped well below $1,000, the NC found itself
without a market.
</P>
<P>
   Network Computer Inc. recently gave up on NCs and turned its
attention to software that connects consumer devices to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Sun makes an NC called the JavaStation which has enjoyed only
modest sales.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with analysts yesterday, Ellison said the
new database appliances embody the idea of the NC. ``The vision is
the same,'' he said. ``We believe that what's going on is that the
PC is in the process of mutating into a network computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts, however, think the failure of the NC has
tarnished Ellison's credibility. ``You really have to take
everything he says with a grain of salt,'' says Rob Enderle of Giga
Information Group. ``He's been long on promises and very short on
execution.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also the question of whether a mutual dislike of Bill
Gates will be enough to ensure a smooth relationship between
Ellison and Sun's CEO Scott McNealy, two of technology's freer
spirits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of these companies have strong leaders who like to go in
their own directions,'' said Enderle. ``And after a while the
direction of one may not include the other one. It will be cool if
it works, but it really ends up depending on how well these folks
can cooperate.''

 Amazon.com's German Rival Keeps Pressure on America's
Top  E-Tailer.  By Mark Veverka  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
German media giant Bertelsmann AG continues to up the ante in its
bid to supplant Amazon.com as the Web's top bookseller.
</P>
<P>
   Bertelsmann Ventures of Santa Barbara, a venture capital fund of
the Bertelsmann Group, is expected to announce today that it has
taken a minority stake in Muenchhoff &AMP; Janz GmbH.
</P>
<P>
   Muenchhoff is a German technology company that created Acses_ a
well-known shopping service that searches the Internet to find the
lowest book prices offered over the Web. Terms of the investment
were not available.
</P>
<P>
   Bertelsmann, which recently spent $200 million for a 50 percent
stake in online bookseller Barnesandnoble.com, says it hopes that
its stake in Acses will keep it apace of Amazon in the e-commerce
race. Acses allows Web users to shop the electronic aisles of some
25 Internet bookstores simultaneously, providing online shoppers
with the lowest price available for a particular book. Shipping
costs and delivery times also are included in the price search.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the system can search the prices of several books
at a time, gathering information for an entire electronic basket of
merchandise. Thus, the buyer only needs to shop at a single Web
site to find the lowest price for his or her total purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the ability to shop for multiple products on various
sites could become a huge factor as e-tailers such as Bertelsmann
and Amazon continue to expand into broader merchandise categories.
For its part, Amazon acquired a similar technology last August when
it bought Junglee, which is best known for its ability to perform
career searches on the Web. Amazon.com closed yesterday at $222.25,
down 75 cents.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Financial Fudging: &LR;  What is it lately with financial advisers
and their propensity to misrepresent their backgrounds and
qualifications?
</P>
<P>
   First there was San Francisco money manager Frank Husic, now
there's personal finance guru Suze Orman. Before you run out to the
mall or dial into your favorite e-tailer to buy Orman's
best-seller, you might want to check out the latest issue of
Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   The financial fortnightly reports that the 47-year-old East Bay
author and financial expert isn't everything she purports to be.
According to Forbes, Orman's latest book _ ``The 9 Steps to
Financial Freedom'' _ includes a biography of the author that
basically lies about her past.
</P>
<P>
   Orman's book calls her company, Suze Orman Financial Group of
Emeryville, a ``financial planning firm.'' Despite that claim,
Forbes contends that she doesn't perform financial planning work
any longer. In fact, aside from book royalties and speaking fees,
Forbes contends that her primary strength is selling insurance. Her
biography also claims that Orman has a current commodity trading
adviser license, but Forbes says the license expired in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   But the creative writing doesn't end with Orman's book. In
addition, Forbes says, the text of one of her videotape jackets
claims that Orman has 18 years of experience working at major Wall
Street institutions. To the contrary, the magazine contends that
Orman spent only seven years toiling for Street firms.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone calls to Orman Financial were referred to a public
relations firm in New York. Telephone calls to the publicist were
not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Another cornerstone to the Forbes piece was the fact that Orman
is a regular guest on Oprah Winfrey's television talk show,
appearing five times.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Oprah's syndicated gabfest commands considerable sway
upon American popular opinion. If Forbes got its facts right, will
Orman continue to get booked on the show? A spokesperson for
Winfrey's Harpo Productions in Chicago says the decision will be
left up to the talk show's executive producer, who was unavailable
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Clarification:  &LR; In Friday's Street Smarts column, utility
consultant Gayatri Schilberg commented on the performance of PG&AMP;E.
Attribution to Schilberg should have been limited only to
comparisons between PG&AMP;E and other in-state utility companies.

DEMOCRATS COUNT IN THE IMPEACHMENT EQUATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also IMPEACH, IMPEACH-POLL, IMPEACH-ASSESS, IMPEACH-DEMS,
IMPEACH-MAIL, IMPEACH-RODINO)

 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although nearly all the speculation in the last few
weeks has focused on certain Republicans in the House, a small
group of renegade Democrats could also affect the arithmetic and
fate of an impeachment vote.
</P>
<P>
   By last weekend, three Democrats, all from relatively
conservative districts in the South, had come out publicly in favor
of impeaching President Clinton. On Monday, Rep. Paul McHale of
Pennsylvania all but definitively joined that short list by voicing
some of his strongest sentiments yet for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   McHale said in a telephone interview Monday evening that he
still did not want to commit himself intractably to any vote, but
he portrayed himself as tilting even more sharply toward impeaching
Clinton than he did a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barring additional information that I would find to be
persuasive, that is the way I'm leaning,'' McHale said. ``I don't
feel I have any other alternative but to hold him accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   The other three Democrats who have publicly said that they favor
impeachment are Reps. Gene Taylor of Mississippi, Ralph M. Hall of
Texas and Virgil H. Goode Jr. of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor confirmed in a telephone interview Monday that he would
vote for impeachment. An aide to Goode said Monday that Goode was
standing by a statement last month supporting impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Hall did not return several telephone messages left with aides
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   At least another eight Democrats were still officially undecided
Monday about what they would do when the full House votes on
impeachment, probably later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials predicted that, in a worst-case scenario,
no more than 10 Democrats in all would vote in favor of
impeachment. They said that party leaders were making appeals in an
effort to limit that number to 5 or fewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thinking is that we really have to keep our numbers as low
as possible,'' said Laura Nichols, a spokesman for House minority
leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri. ``For every Democrat you lose,
you've got to pick up a Republican, and that's very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-one Democrats voted in early October for a formal inquiry
to determine if Clinton's actions stemming from his relationship
with Monica Lewinsky warranted impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   But both Democratic and Republican officials said Monday that
most of those Democrats were expected to vote against the actual
impeachment of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them _ including Reps. Carolyn McCarthy of New York and
Jim Maloney of Connecticut _ have confirmed since the conclusion of
the House Judiciary Committee's work that they opposed impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Maloney said in a telephone interview Monday that though it was
essential to have a thorough investigation into Clinton's actions,
the inquiry has shown that ``the wrongdoing does not amount to the
`high crimes and misdemeanors' standard set forth in the
Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Maloney said that he had received one call from a Democratic
Party leader and another from someone associated with the White
House in recent weeks, but that neither caller had pressured him.
</P>
<P>
   Aides for three other Democrats thought to be undecided said
Monday that the lawmakers would almost certainly vote against the
articles of impeachment. Those Democrats were Reps. James A.
Traficant Jr. of Ohio, Mike McIntyre of North Carolina, and David
Minge of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   The list of Democrats who, aides said, were still at least
officially undecided Monday included Reps. Ike Skelton of Missouri;
Chris C. John of Louisiana; Lane Evans of Illinois; Robert E. (Bud)
Cramer of Alabama; Leonard L. Boswell of Iowa; Ron Kind of
Wisconsin; Charles W. Stenholm of Texas; and William O. Lipinski of
Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic officials and political analysts said that most
of those people would probably end up voting against impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Pat Danner of Missouri was also thought to remain undecided
on Monday. Her spokesman did not return a telephone message.
</P>
<P>
   Charles E. Cook Jr., editor of the Cook Political Report, a
nonpartisan journal, said that most of the Democrats likely to vote
for impeachment come from predominantly Republican districts and
regularly buck the Democratic Party line.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could make a good case that political self-interest is
very much involved,'' Cook said. He said the one clear exception
was McHale, who did not run for re-election in November and will
leave the House next month.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said that while a solid majority of his constituents in
Mississippi support impeachment, he was going to vote that way
because he believed that the president had committed perjury and
should be held accountable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law is the law and everybody has to live by it, no matter
how wealthy or powerful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McHale expressed similar views, saying the president's apologies
over time seemed incomplete and somewhat disingenuous. He said he
kept waiting for a better one, but it never came.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in politics for 20 years, and I've been in public
service for 15 years, and no issue has ever come close in terms of
its importance or the degree to which it's pulled at my
conscience,'' McHale said. ``This is an absolutely sobering
decision of historic consequence.''

GORE CANCELS POLITICAL TRIP IN ORDER TO STAY IN WASHINGTON

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore on Monday night canceled a
political trip that he had scheduled to New Hampshire on Thursday,
saying he would remain in Washington to support President Clinton
during the first day of impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Gore canceled the trip after it became clear to aides that the
visit to New Hampshire might produce conflicting television images
on Thursday night: The vice president tending to his political
career at the same moment that Clinton was battling impeachment
proceedings in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's aides said the trip to New Hampshire, the site of the
first presidential primary, had been scheduled before the
impeachment schedule had been announced. They insisted the
cancellation was not a political decision, though, saying Gore
instead wants to be available if Clinton needs him.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If America does not care about impeachment, tell it
to Cathy Bassett. She works for Rep. Wayne Gilchrest, R-Md., who
until Monday morning had not revealed how he would vote on Thursday
on President Clinton's future. (He is now pro-impeachment.)
</P>
<P>
   Like hundreds of aides in the warrens of Capitol Hill, Ms.
Bassett spent Monday lifting her telephone receiver once or twice a
minute and listening to the views of voters across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lake Tahoe votes Impeach!'' Ms. Bassett declared, dropping her
pen because she did not record votes from outside Gilchrest's
district, from which calls were running about 60 percent in favor
of impeachment. But the caller had little more to say. ``He had to
go and catch the 1 o'clock ski lift,'' Ms. Bassett said before
taking the next call.
</P>
<P>
   Congress may be out of session and members out of town, but the
Capitol is ablaze in advance of Thursday's historic vote. With
unions mobilizing against impeachment and conservatives mustering
in favor, the volume of opinions has sent the Hill into overdrive,
clogging phone lines, maxing out voice mails, draining dry the
toner in fax machines and pushing e-mail systems to tilt.
</P>
<P>
   The Western Union office in the Cannon Office Building on the
House side of the Capitol has churned out more than 12,000
``opinion grams,'' more than four times its regular number, in the
last few days. The grams, a favorite method of communication among
lobbyists, are as numerous now as they were at the height of the
hearings on Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas in 1991. ``We're
processing them as fast as the printers will allow,'' said Mark
Harrop, a spokesman for Western Union Commercial Services.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., said that several members of Congress
could contact their offices only by cell phone because their
regular phone calls were being bumped to that soothing voice that
is the curse of the electronic age: ``All circuits are busy. Please
try your call again later.'' Some aides said they blocked all calls
for various half-hour periods in the day just to clean their voice
mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the contacts were clearly orchestrated. One
anti-impeachment group _ ``Censure and Move On,'' an impromptu
online organization in Silicon Valley _ boasted Monday on the World
Wide Web that it had ``delivered'' 94,659 calls to the Capitol
since Wednesday and could blast fax messages to the three dozen
wavering members of Congress at once.
</P>
<P>
   Three congressional offices reported that they had received
8,000 e-mail messages each over the weekend. Aides to Rep. Tom
Campbell, R-Calif., who has not announced how he will vote, said he
received 900 e-mail messages over the weekend. ``We had to come in
over the weekend and go through them or today the server would have
crashed,'' spokesman Suhail Khan said Monday, adding that most
calls seemed scripted.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitol switchboard registered more than 14,000 phone calls
by midafternoon Monday, which is double the usual volume and does
not include the tens of thousands of calls swamping individual
offices. Rep. David Hobson, R-Ohio, who has not announced how he
will vote, logged about 600 calls Monday here and in his district.
The district phone system, not equipped for so many calls, was
getting ``nuked,'' said Scott Milburn, an aide.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the hub of democracy,'' said Jason Poblete, an aide on
the House Oversight Committee, which keeps track of the mechanics
of running the 435-member House. ``Any time you have an issue that
affects people, they call.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said that their calls were running largely in favor
of impeachment. Democrats said just the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this district is any indication, the nation is waking up to
the fact we're right on the edge,'' said Rep. Bill Delahunt,
D-Mass., a member of the Judiciary Committee who said calls to his
Cape Cod district were running 5-1 against impeachment. He said his
office was getting so many calls, ``we can't handle them.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports of an e-mail system crash on the Hill were exaggerated,
Poblete said, noting that there was merely a bug in two of 14
electronic message servers. He said the problem was not caused by
overload, although there certainly was overload. He said some
people had been calling the main switchboard without knowing who
their representative was, and Capitol operators were taking the
time to direct them.
</P>
<P>
   Other callers were clearly going down lists of names and hitting
``redial'' to the Capitol. Aides in one office said that some
callers seemed confused when they got through. ``Whose office is
this?'' they asked before reading prepared remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the calls we are getting in the D.C. office, about half are
Astroturf and half are real,'' said Milburn, in Hobson's office,
using Washington parlance for calls that seem to be from
individuals but are in fact orchestrated by lobbying groups.
</P>
<P>
   Just who is behind the campaigns is not always clear.
</P>
<P>
   Some are overt, like the effort organized by 1199, the National
Health and Human Service Employees Union, which has transformed its
80-person telemarketing office in New York into an anti-impeachment
phone bank. Dennis Rivera, president of the union, said the
telemarketers were calling people who live in the districts of
eight House Republican moderates, whom he would not identify.
</P>
<P>
   Others were murkier in origin. Several offices have received the
same faxes. A popular one was ``Stop the Insanity of Christmas
Impeachment!'' Some of these appear to be from individuals. Typical
was one addressed simply to ``Dear Representative.'' It read:
``Censure is not enough! Impeachment may be too lenient! This
president is totally untrustworthy.'' It was signed, ``R. Gloria.
Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   How much attention do such faxes receive? Not a lot. They are
collected, but aides in several offices said they did not have time
to read them, and most pay attention only to word from their
districts.
</P>
<P>
   At the prompting of a reporter, an aide in one office went
through a three-inch stack of faxes that had piled up Monday
morning. ``Oh, we have some real faxes in here,'' she said,
sounding surprised as she pulled out a message on Puerto Rican
statehood. She then squealed with delight at the most welcome
message of all: ``Oh! Party invitation! Yes!''

   WASHINGTON _ After a two-year investigation of Chinese political
contributions to the 1996 election, federal authorities have
unearthed new evidence that Beijing's efforts were part of a
broader campaign to obtain access to American high technology,
according to lawyers and investigators.
</P>
<P>
   While still incomplete, the evidence provides a clearer
understanding of China's motivations _ and one that differs
substantially from the initial view of federal investigators and a
Republican-controlled Senate committee _ that China intended to try
to influence the outcome of particular races, including President
Clinton's re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators now believe that the money was intended to enhance
the political standing of those who passed along the contributions
to Democratic causes, to give them more clout as they argued for
favorable policies on trade and technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology was a primary motive,'' said a senior Justice
Department official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   It appears, the official said, that China intended to follow the
example of American corporations, which use campaign donations to
raise the profile of their lobbyists in Washington. Under American
law, foreign governments are prohibited from contributing to
political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators and officials said their new view of China's
motivations was based on inference and evidence that includes bank
records, intercepted telephone calls and statements by witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   While they were sparing in details, the officials said they have
learned of additional links between the fund raisers who arranged
the suspect donations and Chinese executives and officials involved
in acquiring Western technology with military uses. They said the
inquiry has documented more active and substantial contacts between
fund raisers like Yah Lin Trie and Chinese officials than was
previously known.
</P>
<P>
   Another fund raiser in the case, Johnny Chung, was sentenced
Monday to five years' probation by a federal judge in Los Angeles.
Chung had pleaded guilty to bank and tax fraud, telling officials
he funneled tens of thousands of dollars in contributions from a
Chinese military officer to the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign finance investigation began in 1996, when American
intelligence agencies eavesdropped on several conversations in
which Chinese officials discussed a plan to play a role in the
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, investigators focused on the activities of three
principal figures: John Huang, a former Commerce Department
official who became a leading fundraiser for the Democratic Party;
Trie, who is known as Charlie, a close friend of Clinton's from
Arkansas, and Chung, a California entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party, President Clinton's legal defense fund and
Democratic candidates returned several million dollars in
contributions connected to the three men. There is no indication
that the campaigns or the White House knew that Chinese businesses
or government officials were behind any of the donations.
</P>
<P>
   A Senate investigation of the contributions earlier this year
raised questions about the role of the Chinese government, but
lacked the banking records and intelligence information which has
subsequently been made available to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Fred Thompson, the Tennessee Republican who was chairman of
last year's Senate inquiry into campaign finance abuses, was the
first to raise the alarm about China's possible role in the 1996
elections. He initially asserted that the Chinese plan ``affected''
the 1996 presidential and congressional elections, as well as state
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said in a recent interview that he now also believes
that the ``China plan'' was aimed at obtaining American technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were attempting not only to ingratiate themselves
politically but in the process to develop contacts and further
relationships with companies in the U.S. who had the same
technology export interest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of most intriguing new pieces of evidence involves Trie, who
served on a presidential commission on Asian trade policy.
</P>
<P>
   Trie is said to have met in Beijing with Chinese officials and
asked for $1 million that could be used for political activities in
the United States. Their response could not be learned.
</P>
<P>
   According to the investigators, Trie told associates he had
Chinese backing. He eventually raised or contributed more than $1
million for Democratic Party causes.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign inquiry is now examining whether any of this money
originated with Chinese companies or officials. Records show that
Trie received almost $1 million from a Macao businessman with ties
to the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   Trie's lawyer, Reid Weingarten, said he knows nothing of Trie's
activities in China.

WHITE HOUSE CRITICIZES GOP LEADERS FOR REFUSING CENSURE VOTE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
and NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With an impeachment vote looming in the House,
President Clinton's support among Republican moderates softened
Monday as the White House criticized GOP leaders for refusing to
allow a vote to censure the president and avoid trial in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, during a meeting in the Gaza Strip with Palestinian
President Yasser Arafat, warned that the process aimed at removing
him from office was not in the public interest and offered to
consider ``any reasonable compromise'' with Congress to end the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, polls released Monday indicated that although a
majority of Americans believe Clinton lied under oath, they do not
want him impeached. At the same time, a majority says that, if the
House votes to impeach him late this week, the president should
resign rather than face a Senate trial over his effort to cover up
his affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The full House is to meet Thursday to begin debating impeachment
of the president, deliberations that have not occurred in 130
years. Four articles of impeachment accusing Clinton of perjury,
obstruction of justice and abuse of power were approved in
party-line votes by the House Judiciary Committee, which built its
case against the president mostly on evidence developed by
independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Before formally ending its inquiry Saturday, the
Republican-controlled committee rejected efforts by Democrats to
send the full House a resolution rebuking the president. That
resolution of censure, an alternative to impeachment, has been
embraced by the president and several Republican moderates who are
being wooed by the White House in an effort to end the impeachment
process.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., signaled that he was
backing away from his anti-impeachment stand announced more than a
week ago. He asked for and was granted a meeting with Clinton when
he returns from the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to vote today, I would vote against impeachment, but
I am troubled by the president's statements and his continued
inability to tell the American people the truth,'' Shays said.
</P>
<P>
   Also boding ill for Clinton's chance of fending off impeachment
in the House were announcements by Reps. Frank LoBiondo of New
Jersey and Jim Walsh of New York, both of whom were on the White
House list of potential impeachment opponents, that they would
instead vote to send the president's case to the Senate for trial.
</P>
<P>
   With Republicans holding 228 of the 435 House seats, Clinton's
ability to avoid a Senate trial would require winning all 206
Democratic votes, the lone independent and at least a dozen
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   So far, five moderate Republicans, including Shays, have said
they would support the president. At the same time, three Democrats
have said they will vote for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders, including House Majority Leader Dick Armey
of Texas, Whip Tom DeLay of Texas and Judiciary Committee Chairman
Henry Hyde of Illinois, called for Clinton's resignation Sunday.
The three leaders have been urging GOP members to vote against an
anticipated procedural move by Democrats to raise censure as an
alternative to impeachment during Thursday's debate.
</P>
<P>
   In Gaza during a press conference with Arafat, Clinton said it
is not ``in the interest of the United States or the American
people to go through this impeachment process with a trial in the
Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   The president added that he has ``offered to make every effort
to make any reasonable compromise with the Congress. I still
believe that and I'm still willing to do that. That's all I know to
do. Meanwhile, I'm going to keep working at my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if it was appropriate for Republicans to call for his
resignation while he was overseas, Clinton said: ``The boundaries
of what's appropriate have been changed rather dramatically over
the past few months. They'll have to be the judge of their own
conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Vice President Al Gore said Republicans were
defying ``the wisdom of the American people'' in refusing to
consider censure. Regarding calls by Armey, DeLay and Hyde for
Clinton to resign, Gore said: ``That's not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart was sharper in his criticism
of Republican leaders who, he said, have rewritten the book on
partisanship. They are blocking a censure vote, he said, because
they know it has a strong chance of passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a small group of the Republican leadership who have
made it their mission in life to remove the president against
perhaps the will of the House but certainly against the will of the
American public,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   A survey over the weekend by the Pew Research Center found
two-thirds of American adults oppose impeaching Clinton or removing
him from office. A CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll released Monday
indicates that six in 10 Americans oppose impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   An ABC News/Washington Post poll found a similar number of
Americans opposed to impeachment, but found an almost equal number,
58 percent, saying that if he is impeached by the House, Clinton
should resign rather than fight for his job in a Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   While half of the adults surveyed by Pew said they are not happy
with his handling of the investigation into his affair with
Lewinsky, 61 percent approve of the job he is doing as president, a
number that has remained fairly constant since January. Sixty
percent of those in the Pew survey disapproved of the way
Republicans have handled impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Clinton allies have intensified efforts to encourage
voters to contact their congressional representatives to oppose
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson said he will hold a ``prayer vigil''
outside the Capitol on Thursday as lawmakers inside debate the
impeachment articles.
</P>
<P>
   People for the American Way began airing radio advertisements
providing a toll-free telephone line that will route them to their
lawmakers' office. Before the ads began airing, the phone-in
campaign produced more than 130,000 calls against impeachment, the
liberal civil liberties group said.
</P>
<P>
   Phone lines to Capitol offices rang off the hook Monday with
calls on the issue. Calls to the main Capitol switchboard doubled
from their usual volume, a House spokesman said, and calls to many
member offices produced recordings that all circuits were busy.

 WASHINGTON: in China. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investigators say they have learned more about another important
figure in the case, Lt. Col. Liu Chaoying, a Chinese military
officer and aerospace executive. Chung, the California entrepreneur
who raised money for the Democratic Party, has already told
investigators that he took money from Ms. Liu knowing that it came
from the Chinese military.
</P>
<P>
   Now, investigators say, they have a deeper understanding of Ms.
Liu's efforts to help Chinese companies obtain American technology
with military uses. In recent weeks, Chung has told investigators
that he tried to arrange meetings for Ms. Liu with American
aerospace companies when she visited the United States in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Liu did not return a phone call to her office in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   There is also new information about Huang, the former Commerce
Department official who became a Democratic fundraiser. Huang
worked as a banker in Los Angeles before joining the Clinton
administration. Officials said he was overheard by government
surveillance discussing political donations with a Chinese official
at the Los Angeles consulate.
</P>
<P>
   Details of his conversation could not be learned. Huang
subsequently joined the Commerce Department as a mid-level trade
official. Because of his previous work as a banker in Hong Kong, he
was barred from participating in decisions about China.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, officials said, Huang obtained at least one secret
government report on exports of military-related technology to
China, which he kept in his office safe.
</P>
<P>
   Huang's lawyer, Ty Cobb, did not reply to questions about these
matters. Huang has not been charged with wrongdoing, but $1.6
million of the $3.4 million he raised was returned by the
Democratic Party because of unanswered questions about its origins.
</P>
<P>
   China's efforts in the 1996 elections came at a time when the
Clinton Administration was relaxing controls over technology
exports and military exchanges with China, a policy that dovetailed
precisely with Beijing's interests. Still, no evidence has surfaced
that Clinton administration officials knew about the covert Chinese
activities.
</P>
<P>
   But some United States and Chinese aerospace companies may have
tried to improperly exploit the policy shift, investigators say.
The Justice Department is investigating three leading American
aerospace companies, and some of their Chinese counterparts, for
possibly illegal exports of sophisticated machining equipment and
satellite technology.
</P>
<P>
   These cases, involving technology that can be used for both
commercial and military purposes, illustrate the interwoven lines
between government and business in China. These same complex
relationships between the government in Beijing and the nation's
aerospace and arms-production companies have also complicated
efforts by campaign finance investigators to untangle the motives
of the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese leaders have repeatedly denied that they authorized a
government plan to influence the American presidential election.
But Thompson said the denials were hollow because they left open
the possibility that Chinese business interests funneled money into
the American political system.
</P>
<P>
   Last July, at the end of his trip to China, Clinton said Chinese
President Jiang Zemin had told him that no senior Chinese officials
had sanctioned channeling money into American campaigns. But
Clinton said that Jiang said he ``could not speak to whether any
people pursuing their own business interest had done that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese military industrial complex effectively reports to
the communist government through a state council that oversees
extensive business operations focused on technology development.
Those operations include the acquisition, legally and illegally, of
American technology, through imports, front companies and sometimes
theft, according to government officials and documents.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is central to the future of China's armed forces.
Beijing's military strategy, once dependent on a huge land-based
army, has shifted to a reliance on a smaller, more mobile military
heavily oriented toward sophisticated computer and other electronic
weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Pentagon report concludes that the Chinese army has
shown ``exceptional interest'' in acquiring and developing advanced
technology, from information and electronic warfare to
anti-satellite laser capabilities and telecommunications networks.

 WASHINGTON: telecommunications networks.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   These Chinese policy goals are central to understanding the
motivations of Ms. Liu, the first person who provided a link
between Chinese money and Democratic donations. She works for a
Hong Kong unit of China Aerospace, which is ``tasked to acquire
U.S. technology by the Chinese Defense Ministry,'' according to a
1997 Commerce Department affidavit filed in support of a search
warrant in federal court in northern California.
</P>
<P>
   In her previous jobs at other China Aerospace subsidiaries, Ms.
Liu helped market sensitive missile technology in countries like
Pakistan, according to government documents and officials. She also
made secret trips into the United States in pursuit of American
technology and was frequently monitored by American agents,
according to the officials and documents.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Liu was not a focus of Senate hearings last year that
investigated campaign finance abuses. But the Senate inquiry hinted
that major Democratic donors such as Chung, Trie and Ted Sieong, a
Southern California businessman, may have been working with the
Chinese government or acting as conduits for Chinese money. The
donors all denied any wrongdoing and the Senate committee was never
able to trace the sources of their money beyond corporate bank
accounts in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   However, the FBI has now been able to go further. For example,
it found that Ms. Liu made payments to Chung's Hong Kong bank
account, according to officials and documents.
</P>
<P>
   Chung told investigators that Ms. Liu told him about her ties to
the Chinese military, where her father, Gen. Liu Huaqing, was the
senior official on the central military commission until last year.
Huaqing personally ordered an investigation into the January 1995
explosion of a Chinese rocket. Later in 1995, scientists from
Hughes Space and Communications helped the Chinese determine the
cause.
</P>
<P>
   But as it assisted the Chinese in its investigation of the
explosion's cause, Hughes provided _ without proper authorization _
technological insights crucial for launches of ballistic missiles
and satellites to engineers working for a Chinese aerospace
company, the Pentagon concluded in a report released this week. The
aerospace company that benefited was Ms. Liu's employer. The
commercial technology transfer ``raised national security
concerns,'' according to the Pentagon report on the matter. A
Hughes spokeswoman said the transfer was properly authorized by the
Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   Chung helped Ms. Liu enter the United States in 1996 by trying
to arrange meetings for her with top American aerospace companies,
according to a 1996 letter he wrote to her.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said he believes there are some striking similarities
in the political actions of the Chinese and American corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that they had any particular motivation at the moment
but that they had lots of motivations to have access and would
technology access and export controls be part of that? Yes,''
Thompson said.

   Ice Resurfacers Foul the Air at Rinks &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A truck being driven around inside a large enclosed space a
dozen times a day does not sound like a prescription for good air
quality. But it is what happens daily at indoor ice rinks, often
causing nitogen dioxide levels to reach worrisome levels, a study
of 19 public rinks in the Boston area has found.
</P>
<P>
   Place the blame on ice resurfacers, often known as Zambonis for
the original brand, the vehicles that chug slowly round and round
the rinks between periods at hockey games and other ice events,
scraping off slush and putting down fresh water to make a smooth
new top coat of ice.
</P>
<P>
   In a report published recently in the American Journal of Public
Health, researchers found a direct link between the kind of ice
resurfacer used and the levels of nitrogen dioxide in rink air.
</P>
<P>
   Rinks where the resurfacer was powered by propane had average
levels of 206 parts per billion of the gas _ twice the World Health
Organization's recommended maximum level of 110 parts per billion.
Those powered by gasoline averaged 132 parts per billion and rinks
with electrical resurfacers averaged 37 parts per billion.
</P>
<P>
   Some studies have linked chronic exposure to high levels of
nitrogen dioxide to increased risk of respiratory illness. In an
ice rink near St. Paul, a group of teen-age hockey players reported
difficulty breathing after 30 minutes of play in a rink where the
gas level was estimated at 4,000 parts per billion.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan I. Levy, a researcher and doctoral student at the
Harvard School of Public Health, said discomfort that some players
routinely write off as ``hockey lung'' _ tightness in the chest
from exertion in the cold _ could be a result of air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   During the study, four rinks switched from gasoline-powered
resurfacers to electrical ones. The nitrogen dioxide levels at the
rinks dropped sharply, from an average of 124 parts per billion to
35 parts per billion. But electrical resurfacers are expensive,
costing up to $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Levy said less expensive measures _ from tuning the engines of
resurfacers to improved use of ventilation systems _ also showed
results.

   Gifts From Patients Create a Quandary &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most physicians are delighted by the gifts their patients give
them. They are gracious tokens of affection and gratitude. But
theoretically, gifts from patients may cause ethical problems by
creating a sense of obligation and hence potential conflicts of
interest.
</P>
<P>
   For example, what if a doctor accepts gifts as ``payment'' for
extra time and attention in this age of managed care?
</P>
<P>
   Conflicts of interest like these are potentially harmful but not
as immediately harmful as rejecting a gift from a patient, which
may irrevocably fracture the patient-physician relationship. Such
conflicts may be avoided if the physician is careful not to let
gifts influence treatment.
</P>
<P>
   A doctor may also tactfully redirect cash or extravagant gifts
to a charitable or institutional fund. If a gift is inappropriately
extravagant or intimate, the physician should examine the patient's
motivation. The most appropriate response in most situations is a
sincere ``thank you.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Laurie Lyckholm &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Assistant professor of internal medicine, Virginia Commonwealth
University &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The anthropologist Marcel Mauss said that gifts, by their very
nature, create an obligation. There are at least two ethical
problems with this practice. First, by accepting gifts physicians
may be telling patients that such gifts are expected. If one of my
patients learned of a gift given by another patient, she might
conclude that such gifts are a necessary part of our relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Second, managed care requires that physicians be stewards of
scarce resources like tests, procedures and their time. I want to
be sure that I am always willing to spend an hour on hold with an
insurance company for a patient, whether or not she has given me a
gift.
</P>
<P>
   When my patients offer me gifts that might seem to create an
obligation for other patients, or that might improperly influence
my judgment, I explain that I do this work because it's what I
love, not because I expect a reward. &QL;

<P>
   Folic Acid, in a Timely Fashion &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many women know that taking 400 micrograms of folic acid, a B
vitamin, early in pregnancy can reduce the risk of their babies'
having certain birth defects of the brain and spine. But a new
survey conducted by the March of Dimes warns that most women take
it too late in pregnancy to be effective.
</P>
<P>
   Because nearly half of pregnancies in the United States are
unplanned, doctors suggest that women of childbearing age should
take a multivitamin with folic acid whether they are pregnant or
not.
</P>
<P>
   But, the March of Dimes researchers noted, only 25 percent of
women between the ages of 18 and 45 who are not pregnant take a
multivitamin containing folic acid, and the number drops to 19
percent among 18 to 24-year-olds who are not pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to be effective in preventing birth defects,'' said
Dr. Richard B. Johnson, Jr., medical director of the March of Dimes
in White Plains, N.Y., ``folic acid must be consumed before
conception and during the first four weeks of pregnancy.''
</P>
<P>
   Folic acid helps prevent neural tube defects, which are
responsible for birth defects in an estimated 2,500 babies each
year and can result in miscarriages and stillbirths.

   When travelers sit for a long time in cramped airline seats, the
consequences can be far more serious than swollen ankles or an
aching back.
</P>
<P>
   Hours in one position can trigger blood clots in the legs. If
the clots dislodge and move into the lungs, they can be deadly.
Doctors know the problem formally as deep vein thrombosis, but some
of them call it economy class syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, former Vice President Dan Quayle was treated for blood
clots in both lungs and his right leg after frequent domestic
flights. And in 1996, a passenger on a British Airways flight
collapsed when multiple blood clots moved into his lungs.
</P>
<P>
   Now doctors at Tripler Army Medical Center in Honolulu found
that about one-fourth of 134 patients suffering from clumps of
clotted blood in the lower legs _ and that 82 percent showed
symptoms as long as two weeks later. There were 36 percent of
travelers who had no other predisposition for the syndrome, said
Dr. Joel Brown, one of the authors of the study.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting for long periods _ four hours or more _ reduces
circulation in the legs by 50 percent, the researchers said.
Besides clots, the results can include pain, swelling, redness,
tenderness in the calves and, infrequently, fever.
</P>
<P>
   The dry air in airline cabins only makes things worse, they
said, because it makes the blood more viscous, encouraging clots.
Smoking, pregnancy, obesity, use of oral contraceptives, a history
of deep vein thrombosis, varicose veins and eating fatty foods can
also raise the risk of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Experts recommend exercising before the flight and during the
flight, either by walking in the aisles or in your seat. Drinking
plenty of water, taking aspirin (with a doctor's approval) and
wearing below-the-knee support hose if you have varicose veins,
also help prevent the problem.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, called on some of Wall Street's leaders in the summer
of 1994 with a warning.
</P>
<P>
   Congress was asking pointed questions about whether complex
financial contracts called derivatives could topple a major
financial institution or even threaten the financial system. Wall
Street, he said, should do something. It did.
</P>
<P>
   The following spring, six of the biggest Wall Street investment
firms released a plan to tighten their own controls of derivatives
while giving regulators greater access to their records. The firms,
it was argued, knew best how to manage their own risky world of
finance and might even create a model of self-regulation.
</P>
<P>
   But the weaknesses of that system were exposed in September when
Long-Term Capital Management, the giant hedge fund with big bets in
the derivatives market, careered toward collapse, threatening to
ignite a global financial panic. Fourteen firms, including all six
of those that had favored self regulation, eventually agreed to
rescue Long-Term Capital in an extraordinary deal brokered by the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion that one fund's misstep could harbor such dire
consequences has Congress reconsidering how to oversee the booming
derivatives market.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every previous instance of derivative problems, the
industry and the regulators said do nothing,'' Rep. Edward J.
Markey, D-Mass., a member of the House Banking Committee, said in
an interview. ``But now we see that industry risk management
controls were lacking.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress has asked a presidential working group _ with
representatives from the Federal Reserve Board, the U.S. Treasury,
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission _ to deliver a study in the coming year on the
derivatives market and another on the public policy implications of
the near collapse of Long-Term Capital. Members of the working
group will give a progress report to the Senate Agriculture
Committee on Wednesday. Former Fed officials and regulators will
also testify before the committee, one of several looking into the
near collapse of Long-Term Capital.
</P>
<P>
   Though congressmen and regulators have not yet lined up behind
specific proposals, the debate over additional regulation is
spreading beyond just hedge funds and focusing on three broad
areas:
</P>
<P>
   _ New disclosure requirements for hedge funds, which are largely
unregulated, and derivatives dealers. These groups might have to
reveal their closely guarded trading positions and their risk
levels frequently to regulators. The idea has support from much of
the financial industry, which says it would at least provide a
window on the amount of hedging and the amount of speculating in
the market.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some limit on how much commercial and investment banks can
lend to hedge funds like Long-Term Capital or new disclosure on
that lending. For example, securities regulators might decide to
monitor hedge funds weekly or monthly, rather than rely on the
quarterly filings now made to the futures commission.
</P>
<P>
   _ The creation of a clearing house, much like a stock exchange,
for the trading of derivatives that do not now have an exchange. A
clearing house could hold both parties accountable and step in to
complete transactions if one party was unable to cover its losses,
reducing the chance that a big default would trigger a series of
defaults.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, brokerage firms now patrol their own risks,
and bank regulators tend to focus on overall risk management
practices, though they may look at industry sectors or even
specific loans if they have a special concern. Hedge funds, which
are investment pools open only to wealthy investors, are largely
unregulated.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts at additional oversight will face stiff opposition from
financial industry officials, who consider more regulation costly
and cumbersome _ possibly stifling the smooth functioning of the
derivatives markets. Derivatives, so called because their value is
derived from an underlying asset like a stock or a bond, allow
companies and individuals to manage many types of risk, like a
sudden fluctuation in a currency or an interest rate, throughout
the global marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Even government regulators are torn over how and whether to
tighten rules on derivatives. In Washington, officials at the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission are in a pitched battle with
the Treasury, the Fed and the SEC over which agency has
jurisdiction and whether any further regulation is needed.
</P>
<P>
   The derivatives market has faced down oversight before. In late
1994, Orange County, Calif., made headlines by declaring bankruptcy
after suffering more than $1.6 billion in derivatives-related
losses. And the next year, Barings PLC, Britain's oldest investment
bank, collapsed after a 27-year-old trader struck out in the
derivatives market.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, after studies and consideration, regulators
backed down from wholesale regulation for fear of impeding the
market's growth. Instead, they have made incremental changes in the
way banks and brokerage firms _ the major dealers in the
derivatives market _ handle transactions and support industry
efforts at self regulation.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Regulators in other countries are wrestling with the problem as
well. Last July, Swiss regulators criticized Europe's biggest bank,
the Union Bank of Switzerland, for weaknesses in its management of
derivative risks. Three months later, UBS said it would take a $700
million loss on its business with Long-Term Capital. Since then,
Dresdner Bank of Germany and Credit Suisse First Boston have also
taken big hits because of Long-Term Capital.
</P>
<P>
   These missteps from some of the world's most prestigious
financial institutions point to another concern: The giant
derivatives market rests on about a dozen global financial
institutions, which account for more than half of all derivatives
business, according to Swaps Monitor, an industry publication. That
concentration troubles some financial experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have huge risks building up on the shoulders of these few
huge financial institutions that dominate this market'' said Henry
T.C. Hu, a derivatives expert and professor at the University of
Texas Law School. ``That's a Herculean task and one that I worry
about a little more now that Long-Term Capital almost collapsed.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Long-Term Capital is considered unusual in the size of
its bets, the extensive amount it borrowed and the number of
markets it entered, there is nothing to prevent other investors
from getting into similar predicaments.
</P>
<P>
   A report by the International Monetary Fund suggests more
problems are lurking. In its annual survey of international capital
markets, released this fall, the IMF referred to ``ticking time
bombs'' buried in losing derivative trades by financial
institutions in emerging markets like Asia _ time bombs that could
shake government officials out of their regulatory slumber.
</P>
<P>
   Derivatives contracts have exploded in the last 10 years as a
way for corporations, local governments and others looking to
manage risks in the global marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   An American company doing business in Japan, for example, might
buy an option on the Japanese yen to protect itself against a
decline in the currency that could hurt its profits, posted in
American dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Many derivatives are standardized contracts, like the foreign
currency contract described here. These contracts, called
``plain-vanilla'' derivatives, trade on a financial exchange that
is regulated. But many other derivatives contracts are tailored for
specific parties, like an interest rate swap, in which one party
agrees to exchange a fixed interest rate for a floating rate with a
second party for a specified period. Such private business
contracts are traded over the counter and remain off banks' balance
sheets. It is this second type of derivative that is the most
vexing for regulators since trading is conducted behind closed
doors and largely unregulated.
</P>
<P>
   Derivatives of both types have grown, though they are measured
in different ways, making direct comparisons difficult. For the
contracts not traded on an exchange, the prime measure is notional
value, or the amount of the underlying asset on which they are
based. About $37 trillion in such contracts are now out, up from
$865 billion in 1987, according to the International Swap and
Derivatives Association.
</P>
<P>
   As this market has grown, so has concern about whether banks,
brokerage firms and derivatives dealers could be brought down by a
market mishap, a big bet turned sour or a rogue trader at another
institution. In 1993, the House Banking Committee issued a 900-page
report on the derivatives market, which one congressman called the
``new wild card in international finance,'' presaging the jitters
over Orange County, Barings and Long-Term Capital.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office released a study the next year
that identified a number of risks to the system and to individual
firms; it led to more internal controls by firms. Partly because of
Levitt's prodding, the Wall Street firms agreed to train their top
managers and board members on derivative risks, enhance their
reporting to the SEC and the CFTC, take derivatives into account
when setting aside capital, and follow certain guidelines when
dealing with people who are not finance professionals.
</P>
<P>
   A drumbeat for greater disclosure is now being sounded by
prominent Wall Street figures and hedge fund managers such as
George Soros, Julian H. Robertson Jr. of Tiger Management,
Citigroup Chairman Sanford I. Weill and Goldman, Sachs co-chairman
Jon Corzine.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators and the financial markets could, the thinking goes,
operate much better with more information. Bank regulators already
have access to information about derivatives risk; in fact, they
often set up shop inside big banks. Brokerage firms voluntarily
provide quarterly reports on the risks associated with derivatives.
The question remains, though, whether regulators receive
information on a timely basis and whether they need information on
hedge funds.

 &HT;    Anderson's best blocker placed on IR
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If the sight of Atlanta Falcons backup running back
Gary Downs putting a sock on the left foot of fullback Bob
Christian after Sunday's 27-17 win at New Orleans wasn't enough to
bring tears to the eyes of running back Jamal Anderson, the news
Monday may have done it.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons placed Christian on injured reserve with torn
anterior cruciate and medial collateral ligaments in his left knee,
leaving Anderson without the man who was lead blocker for many of
his 1,596 yards and 12 rushing touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Christian was replaced on the active roster by tight end
Roderick Monroe (6 feet 4, 244 pounds), who was signed off the
practice squad for a prorated salary of about $18,600 for the final
two games. He'll share backup tight end duties with Ed Smith as No.
2 tight end Brian Kozlowski becomes the primary fullback.
</P>
<P>
   Christian, who leans heavily on his faith, may have taken it
better than Anderson. The 5-foot-11, 230-pounder was on crutches
Monday, his left leg in a brace, as he went on injured reserve for
the third time in his seven-year career.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to have to hump it (in rehabilitation) to get back
for training camp,'' said Christian, who caught 19 passes for 214
yards and a touchdown and rushed eight times for 21 yards and two
touchdowns. ''This will make me stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dan Reeves has repeatedly called Christian ''the best
blocker I've ever seen.'' Anderson has no argument.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has worked so hard, and has been so valuable,'' he said.
''I don't know this (offensive) system without Bobby Christian. I
have confidence in his backups, but I'm not looking forward to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have no other true fullbacks on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   The replacements
</P>
<P>
   Kozlowski (6-3, 255), who occasionally subs for Christian, will
become the primary blocking back, and Downs (6-1, 218) will take
over some of Christian's third-down responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe, who will become a backup tight end, played basketball
for three years at the University of Cincinnati, and then played
football as a walk-on, catching two passes for 33 yards and a
touchdown last year. He also had 30 knockdown blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas drafted Monroe in the seventh round and cut him in
training camp. He has shown athletic ability in practice and fine
pass-catching skills, although his route-running is suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 29, the brother of 49ers tight end Irv Smith, has no
catches in his two-year career after spending seven years in
minor-league baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The team will add a player to the practice squad.
</P>
<P>
   Injury update
</P>
<P>
   Other than Christian, the Falcons emerged from Sunday's win over
the Saints fairly healthy, although weakside linebacker Cornelius
Bennett's knee sprain is serious enough that he underwent an MRI
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Exact results were not known Monday night, but vice president of
football operations Ron Hill said it was his understanding nothing
should cause Bennett to miss playing time.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-year veteran had nine tackles against the Saints, and is
tied with middle linebacker Jessie Tuggle for the team lead with
105.
</P>
<P>
   ''I started wearing knee braces in '89 (when he was with
Buffalo),'' said Bennett, who missed only a few plays because of he
injury. ``There's no doubt the brace saved my knee (from further
damage).''
</P>
<P>
   Reserve cornerback Randy Fuller, who missed the past two games
with a strained shoulder, will practice Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Chasing history
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons (12-2) will have plenty of incentives to win Sunday
at Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   A victory would set a franchise record, surpassing the team's
12-4 mark in '80, when they won the only NFC West title. It would
also clinch the division title, and tie the Falcons' mark for best
road record, giving them a 6-2 ledger to match what the '80 team
did.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta has won seven straight games, and if the Falcons win
their last two games, including a Dec. 27 home game against Miami
(9-5), the nine straight wins would tie the franchise mark, set in
'80.
</P>
<P>
   Big, little numbers
</P>
<P>
   After hitting the Saints for a season-high 504 yards, the
Falcons have moved up to No. 6 in the NFL in total offense,
averaging 348.1 yards per game. The defense, meanwhile, remains
ranked No. 7, allowing an average of 291.1 yards, 211 over the past
four games. . . . Atlanta has allowed 256 points, third-fewest in
the NFL, and scored 380, fourth-most.
</P>
<P>
   Milestones
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Ray Buchanan's interception against the Saints gave
him seven. He leads the NFC, and is one short of his career high,
set in '94 with the Colts. . . . With 10 touchdown receptions this
year, wide receiver Terance Mathis has scored 43 since becoming a
Falcons in '94. That's fifth-most in the NFL behind Minnesota's
Cris Carter (57), Cincinnati's Carl Pickens (50), Detroit's Herman
Moore (45 before Monday night), and San Francisco's Jerry Rice (44
before Monday night). After scoring twice at New Orleans, Mathis is
third in team history in TDs scored, trailing wide receiver Andre
Rison (56) and running back Gerald Riggs (48). His team-record 198
receiving yards Sunday (on six catches) were the second-most in the
NFL this year, trailing a 204-yard effort (on 13 catches) by
Pickens Oct. 11 against Pittsburgh. . . Quarterback Chris Chandler
is the league's fourth-rated passer, with a rating of 96.2. His
career high was 95.1 last year, when he was No. 2 in the NFL. His
21 TD passes this season are a Falcon record. . . . . Defensive end
Lester Archambeau had Atlanta's only sack against New Orleans,
forcing a fumble by Kerry Collins. That increased Archambeau's
team-leading numbers to 10 and seven, career highs in those
categories.
</P>
<P>
   Pro Bowl picks
</P>
<P>
   Players around the league voted Monday on who they think should
make the Pro Bowl, and rosters will be announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons with the best chances of getting selected as
players' votes count one-third, coaches' votes one-third, and fans'
votes one third are Anderson (who is second in the league in
rushing), Chandler, Buchanan, Tuggle, and Mathis (61 catches, 1,085
yards).
</P>
<P>
   The next tier in what can be a political process includes
Bennett, defensive end Chuck Smith (71 tackles, 7.5 sacks, 32
quarterback pressures, nine tackles for a loss, two fumble
recoveries), Archambeau (74 tackles, four for a loss, two fumble
recoveries), and left tackle Bob Whitfield.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle Shane Dronett (72 tackles, 6.5 sacks) and free
safety Eugene Robinson (81 tackles, three interceptions, two
fumbles forced, one recovered) are longshots.
</P>
<P>
   Upon review
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield committed four penalties against the Saints in a span
of a few minutes. But game film indicated that New Orleans
defensive end Joe Johnson had just one of his team-high eight
tackles and one quarterback pressure while matched up against
Whitfield.
</P>
<P>
   Time change
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's game at Detroit, where the Falcons (12-2) have lost
five straight and 12 of 14, has been changed from 1 p.m. to 4:15
p.m. It will be carried on Fox.

 UNDATED: hedge funds. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brooksley E. Born, chairwoman of the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, says that secrecy in the derivatives market is
worrisome. ``There has been a great deal of concern internationally
about the lack of transparency,'' she said in an interview. ``I
share that concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Creating a more open market, however, is fraught with
difficulty. The value of derivatives contracts changes rapidly,
making information out of date as soon as it is gathered. And what
exactly would derivatives dealers and hedge funds disclose, since
others could use that information for market gains, and whom would
they disclose it to? Regulators? Investors? Creditors?
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is to restrict how much regulated financial
institutions can lend or require hedge funds to put up more
collateral, in effect putting a brake on easy lending, which some
industry officials argue is the crux of the matter. ``What was
wrong with Long-Term Capital wasn't derivatives, it was
borrowing,'' said Thomas Clark, a managing director in the
derivatives area for J.P. Morgan. ``This is all about leverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term Capital had borrowed assets equal to 25 times its
capital at the end of last year, making it look more like a
securities firm than the typical hedge fund. As Long-Term Capital
coughed up additional money to satisfy its lending agreements, its
borrowed assets rose to 90 times its dwindling capital.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. James Leach, R-Iowa, and others suggest that new rules
may be needed to protect against a national banking crisis since
hedge funds are often supported by federally insured banks. ``It
would be imprudent and anti-intellectual not to seriously review
the derivatives and hedge fund industries,'' Leach, chairman of the
House Banking Committee, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of such proposals say that government interference would
only impede business. ``The problem in the derivatives market is
that it's hard to figure out what something's worth,'' said Michael
Segal, president of Lamborn Securities, a derivatives dealer in New
York. ``You can't come up with a standard measurement to put
restrictions on leverage. This is not the place for government.''
</P>
<P>
   A third proposal is the use of a private clearinghouse to settle
the many derivatives trades that are not now handled on any
exchange. The change would be much like that in the market for
small stocks, which once traded over the counter before Nasdaq came
along to standardize trading.
</P>
<P>
   A clearinghouse, for a fee, would match trades and guarantee
that all transactions are honored, even if one party goes bankrupt
before making good on its contract. It could also be used to impose
controls on borrowing. The clearinghouse proposal has received a
great deal of attention and was recommended by the Bank for
International Settlements, which coordinates global banking rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been talked about for a long time,'' said Leslie Rahl, a
principal with Capital Markets Risk Advisers, a New York consulting
firm specializing in derivatives. But the idea ``hasn't gone
anywhere because of dealer resistance _ the costs and the
complexities in agreeing on what something can be valued at.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether a clearinghouse could stave off huge losses amid severe
market turmoil is hard to determine. ``A domino effect will bring
down a clearing operation, too,'' said Franklin Edwards, a
professor of economics and finance at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the proposals being forwarded, many regulators and
financial experts worry that creating more regulatory hurdles could
disrupt or stifle a vibrant and vital marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very easy to call for regulation, but one needs to assess
whether it's going to do any good,'' said Susan Phillips, dean of
the school of business and management at George Washington
University and until recently a member of the Federal Reserve
Board. ``Every time someone talks about a new regulatory scheme it
adds costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Phillips and a host of regulators have long opposed tighter
controls on derivatives that are traded over the counter. Many of
them, including the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, believe
that the market can be more effectively regulated through banks and
brokerage firms. ``The best we can do in my judgment is what we do
today: regulate them indirectly through the regulation of the
source of their funds,'' Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan told the House
Banking Committee after the Long-Term Capital rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Soros has echoed that opinion.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the banks argue that their examiners already
scrutinize derivatives activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every swap contract at every bank is regulated,'' said Mark
Brickell, a board member of the International Swaps and Derivatives
Association and a managing director at J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   That leads some industry observers to conclude that it was not
the absence of controls but a regulatory failure that brought
Long-Term Capital to the brink and threatened its business
partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to, do you think the regulation of banks is
sufficient?'' Edwards, of Columbia University, said. ``If the links
in the chain are strong, the chain won't break. But the fact is,
it's very difficult for regulators to see what's going on; this
market is too complex, too opaque and too fast moving.''

AS OIL PRICES FALL, SHELL PLANS JOB CUTBACKS, REVAMPING
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LONDON _ As the lowest prices in 12 years continue to roil the
oil industry, the giant Royal Dutch/Shell Group announced Monday
that it would sell 40 percent of its chemicals businesses and take
$4.5 billion in charges as part of a sweeping reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by Mark Moody-Stuart, the company's chairman,
to an analysts' meeting here was the latest sign of upheaval in the
industry after proposed acquisitions by British Petroleum of Amoco
and Exxon of Mobil. The cutbacks, which will include job losses,
are expected to affect Shell operations as far afield as Texas,
Venezuela, Britain, Norway and France.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the measures as a ``clearing out of the cupboard'' at
the world's largest publicly traded oil company, Moody-Stuart
declined, however, to specify how many of the company's 105,000
workers were likely to lose their jobs in the reorganization.
Through its Shell Oil subsidiary, based in Houston, Royal
Dutch/Shell employs about 20,000 workers in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The American unit has formed a joint venture with Texaco under
which all but one of its refineries and all its gasoline stations
have been combined under a company called Equilon Enterprises in
the Midwest and West. Shell has also formed another joint venture
with Texaco and Saudi Refining Inc. to combine its refining and
marketing in the East and the Gulf Coast states. About 7,000 of the
20,000 employees are part of the two ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Before Monday's meeting, there had been speculation that
Moody-Stuart might use the occasion to announce a merger, possibly
with Chevron. But he seemed to rule out immediate merger plans,
saying: ``We have a great deal to do in our own shop. We have
looked at merger possibilities and will continue to look at such
possibilities, and if the right opportunity arises, we will act.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But we are large enough to be the leading company on our own
without a merger,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Plummeting oil prices, compounded by falling demand from Asia's
troubled economies, have cut into oil-company profits this year.
Earnings at Shell, for instance, fell 31 percent in the first nine
months of this year, to $4.3 billion, compared with results in the
period a year earlier. The price here of Brent crude oil remained
just below $10 a barrel Monday, compared with a high last year of
close to $25. In New York, oil for January delivery rose 50 cents,
to $11.29 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Moody-Stuart said the $4.5 billion in charges would be applied
against fourth-quarter earnings, part of a plan to reduce annual
costs by $2.5 billion by 2001. The calculations, he said, were
based on expectations that oil prices might remain around $10 a
barrel next year but would average $14 a barrel over the next five
years. A year ago, the forecast was for $18 a barrel on average.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Shell's corporate cutbacks are intended to raise the company's
return on capital investment from the 9 percent it posted in the
fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30. But here, too, Moody-Stuart
trimmed back expectations to 14 percent from 15 percent forecast
last year because of the cutbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had to make tough choices, but although we have made
some very big cuts, with an $11 billion global spending program, we
still have plenty of room for growth,'' he said, adding that this
put Shell ``ahead of the competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had mixed views on the announcement, with some saying
that Shell had fallen short of what was expected and others arguing
that the cost reductions were in line with those envisioned in the
Exxon-Mobil deal.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Wilson of J.P. Morgan Securities in New York said that with
its announcement, Royal Dutch/Shell had ``reconfirmed their
commitment to get their own house in order'' and had taken ``a very
good step in the right direction.'' But he added, ``People will
want to see the numbers on the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, the markets had something of a mixed reaction. Shares
of Royal Dutch/Shell rose 1.6 percent in Amsterdam. By contrast,
the American depository receipts of the Shell Transport and Trading
Co., whose stock has plummeted 20 percent this year, fell $1.4375
in New York, to $35.75. New York-listed shares of the Royal Dutch
Petroleum Co., which owns 60 percent of the Royal Dutch/Shell
Group, fell $1.75, to $46.5625.
</P>
<P>
   The company's reorganization will reduce the number of chemical
businesses to 13 from 21, and the cuts in oil operations will
mainly affect high-cost production and refining operations. These
include projects in Texas, California and Venezuela. The Sola
refinery in Norway will be closed, as will the Reichstett refinery
in Norway later. The measures were by far the most drastic in
months of omens that Royal Dutch/Shell was feeling the pain.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the announcement Monday, the company had said it
would close four big European offices and had begun cutting jobs at
some divisions, including 3,000 at its European refining and
fuel-marketing unit and 740 at Shell Oil's exploration and
production unit in the United States. Monday's measures, moreover,
came a few days after Moody-Stuart ordered a streamlining of top
management to eliminate cumbersome committees. ``We have entered a
new period where executive decisions have to be made rapidly and
business accountability must be absolutely clear,'' he said at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Dutch/Shell was formed in 1907 from the merger of Royal
Dutch Petroleum and Shell Transport and Trading, a British company
that shipped kerosene to the Far East and based its logo on the
shells it imported into Britain to adorn Victorian residences.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, its management style has acquired a reputation for
sluggishness. Moody-Stuart runs the company as chairman of a
committee of five senior directors, who make decisions by
consensus. He has not commented on reports that he plans to become
a chief executive modeled on American corporate culture lines.
</P>
<P>
   His reluctance to give details about job losses angered British
labor leaders despite assurances from the company's British
headquarters that there would be no big layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company should stop having secret back-room meetings about
job losses and speak to people about how this will affect their
jobs,'' said Roger Lyons, general secretary of the Manufacturing,
Science and Finance Union.

FASHION NEWS AND NOTES  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Off to Beijing &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Beene, who's shown his designs at American Embassies in
Italy, France, Belgium and Austria, is going to stage his first
fashion show in China, on March 26 at the China International
Clothing and Accessories Fair in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new adventure, a new continent, a way to further the
cause of American design,'' Beene said.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Fuller, an international apparel-industry consultant who
is working with the Chinese government to prepare the event, says
about 100,000 people are expected to attend the four-day fair,
which will end with the Beene show.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime advocate of American design that is free of European
influences, Beene, 71, will show such highlights from his career as
his sequined football-jersey dress of 1967, his sweatshirt-fabric
and denim evening dresses of 1970, his ``Little King'' sequined
comic strip evening dress of 1971, his ``ballgown of the 21st
century'' (a black silk crepe jumpsuit) of 1989, and his spiraling
zipper dresses for spring 1999.
</P>
<P>
   (The zipper dresses, which will be featured in six windows at
Saks Fifth Avenue in February, are technological breakthroughs
achieved in the Beene workrooms. As the designer explained, ``No
one makes curving zippers, so we created our own.'')
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Karan's Youngest Line &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Donna Karan, a baby boomer in good standing (she turned 50 in
October), has a new baby. The designer said she gave birth, so to
speak, to a new infants and toddlers line because ``everyone around
me is having babies.'' The clothes, which will be in stores in
January, will reflect what the designer calls ``the esthetics of
the parents _ nothing fussy, nothing cutesy.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the line is not meant to be a downsized version of DKNY
clothes, the look is definitely urban, featuring sweatshirt
dresses, jumpsuits emblazoned with the Statue of Liberty, hooded
nylon athletic jackets, drawstring pants and shorts, jeans and jean
jackets, oxford-cloth diaper covers and T-shirt dresses. The most
expensive item is a washable silk dress at $60.
</P>
<P>
   The line, which will carry a ``dkny'' logo, all lowercase, is a
division of Ms. Karan's DKNY Kids collection. A spokeswoman said
the most popular items with the stores where the clothes will be
sold _ Bloomingdale's, Lord &AMP; Taylor, Macy's West, Neiman Marcus
and Saks Fifth Avenue _ are two $40 designs, one a heart-print
jumper and the other a dotted peasant dress.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Karan says her muses are her four stepgrandchildren,
MacKenzie, Miles, Etan and Maya.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Workroom to Showroom &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Pattern makers make patterns, of course, creating a blueprint
from a designer's sketch. Few step out of the sample room into the
showroom. But one who has is Ling-Shan Li, who says she has always
had the soul of a designer. ``That's what I studied at F.I.T., and
now I think I'm ready,'' said Ms. Li, who was born in Taiwan. So do
the buyers at Linda Dresner and Takashimaya, who have bought Ms.
Li's first collection, for delivery next spring.
</P>
<P>
   With Fang-Ching Li, her sister who is also a pattern maker (yes,
there's a pattern here), the designer has formed her own business,
with a showroom at 137 Fifth Avenue. Her first designs, priced from
about $225 to $500, demonstrate her skills at cutting and draping
and underscore her aesthetic connection to Rei Kawakubo of Comme
des Garcons and Yohji Yamamoto, designers she said she admires
greatly.
</P>
<P>
   One jacket is cut so that the lapels end with the selvage of the
fabric. Dresses, many with one seam, are often cut on the bias with
a loose, sometimes twisting fit rather than the curve-tracing lines
normally associated with cross-grain cutting.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Francis Roth, a designer who once hired Ling-Shan Li,
called her ``serious, professional, and she has this amazing
calming effect.'' So do her coolly serene clothes.

DIAMOND DAYS ARE HERE AGAIN  
(JT)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Maybe it's the time of year. Maybe it's the time of
the century. Whatever the reason, stores report that diamond
jewelry is selling, from a few tiny stones on a chain to elaborate
necklaces. So the entry of Robert Lee Morris into the fine jewelry
field seems to be well timed.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, who is known for hand-wrought, sculptural jewelry of
silver or gold-toned metal, recently introduced a collection of
18-karat-gold and platinum pieces with diamonds and pearls. He has
used many of his signature motifs of crosses, links and toggle
closings in an extensive collection of earrings, necklaces and
cuffs.
</P>
<P>
   Prices range from $700 for a tiny diamond cross on a chain to
$250,000 for a reversible bib with 17.5 carats of diamonds on one
side and 35 Biwa pearls on the other.
</P>
<P>
   Saks Fifth Avenue has some pieces. The entire collection is at
the Robert Lee Morris store, 400 West Broadway, near Spring Street.

 &HT;    Tobacco farmers expecting low quota for '99 crops
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROWN SUMMIT, N.C. _ Luke Lambeth, a 35-year-old farmer, had
once hoped that his young children would have the opportunity to
grow tobacco, just as their ancestors had done since the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   But today, thousands of tobacco growers across the South will
learn how severely the golden leaf's declining fortunes will
threaten their livelihoods. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has
until midnight to announce how much flue-cured tobacco farmers can
grow next year.
</P>
<P>
   Farm leaders predict the government could slash flue-cured
allotments by as much as a third. The quota cut for 1999 would be
on top of a 17 percent reduction in the quota on this year's crop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some farmers out there are going to go broke as it is now,''
said Lambeth, who barely broke even this fall on the 140 acres of
tobacco that he harvested in the North Carolina Piedmont. ``A man
with a big debt load cannot survive with a 40 percent cut in
income.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco allotments, or quotas, much like real estate, can be
bought, sold or leased. In many rural communities, income from
leased quotas, coupled with Social Security, often pays for
farmers' retirement. Last month's national settlement between major
cigarette producers and 46 states promises to speed the downward
spiral of America's tobacco industry. After signing the deal,
manufacturers hiked cigarette prices by 45 cents a pack to pay for
the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The industry agreed to pay $206 billion over 25 years in
exchange for the states, including Georgia, dropping lawsuits
seeking reimbursement for the costs of treating sick smokers.
</P>
<P>
   The historic settlement requires that the tobacco manufacturers
discuss a separate settlement with farmers. Growers fear that
higher cigarette prices will reduce smoking and thus cut demand for
their crop. Farmers immediately rejected as too cheap a tentative
plan that would reimburse farmers as much as $5.1 billion in lost
profits over 10 years. The No. 2 manufacturer, R.J. Reynolds,
quickly withdrew from that plan, saying rather than bail out
farmers, it would buy enough of their tobacco to keep them
profitable. Luke Lambeth's father, Phil, 71, had accumulated quotas
on about 140 acres. But reductions by the federal program have cut
the acreage by half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent my life savings, and now they are taking it away 20
percent at a time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a government-sponsored referendum a year ago, the elder
Lambeth was among more than 97 percent of flue-cured tobacco
growers who said they favored retaining the quota program.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Phil Lambeth said, ``I am not sure I would vote for it
anymore. If they keep the quota system in, it may drive us out of
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as tobacco quotas have guaranteed growers a minimum price
for their flue-cured leaf, some farmers are advocating what just a
few years ago seemed unthinkable. They think Congress should phase
out the Depression-era program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an archaic system,'' said Rick Apple, 41, a
fourth-generation grower in Brown Summit who depends on tobacco for
half of his farm income. ``Looking in my crystal ball, I'm guessing
that the existing program cannot last for more than two to five
years.''
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH'S GOLDEN LEAF
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco remains a major cash crop in the South. Here are the
1998 sales figures for flue-cured tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   N. Carolina $1.03 billion
</P>
<P>
   Georgia 174.5 million
</P>
<P>
   S. Carolina 171.1 million

FASHION'S BEST-GUARDED SECRET, THE ASSISTANT, EMERGES

(JT) 
 By RUTH LA FERLA    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the din of applause that followed Bill Blass'
runway show for spring 1999, the designer emerged at the end of the
catwalk, one arm around each of his two chief assistants, a gesture
of acknowledgment as generous as it was rare.
</P>
<P>
   In an industry famous for its seething rivalries and titanic
egos, Blass' decision to take his bows last month with the two
assistant designers _ Laura Montalban and Craig Natiello _ was so
unusual that Natiello, a dry-spoken man with a distinctly jaded
air, was momentarily giddy. ``I feel like a deb,'' he said
afterward. ``Maybe I should have worn white.''
</P>
<P>
   If Natiello's instant in the limelight turned his head, you
really couldn't blame him. He and many of his counterparts at other
fashion houses have long toiled in obscurity, their contributions
recognized only by close associates and a handful of fashion
insiders. Until relatively recently, the assistant designer was an
employer's best kept secret, generating ideas and sometimes
executing them, sketching models and draping mannequins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's a designer in the world who doesn't have
an assistant or a design team behind him,'' said the designer
Carolina Herrera. ``But few people talk about it. And the team is
always hidden.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, however, the veil of secrecy has begun to lift, if only
by degrees. It may be because so many former assistants have
succeeded in what almost all aspire to: emerging as stars
themselves, appointed to lead houses. They include Tom Ford, the
designer for Gucci; Alber Elbaz, formerly an apprentice with
Geoffrey Beene and recently named Yves Saint Laurent's designer of
ready to wear, and Narciso Rodriguez, who has his own line, and
also designs for Loewe.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, only a handful of well-known designers _ most
notably Giorgio Armani and Nino Cerruti in Europe and Beene in New
York _ introduced their backup team on the runway and to the press,
bluntly declaring that a fashion collection is not the product of a
single mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are bound to be influenced by the esthetics and the
technological expertise of the people who work for you,'' said
Cerruti, Rodriguez's former employer. Pretending otherwise is
disingenuous, if not archaic, he continued, adding, ``It reminds me
of the time young girls were kept as virgins in a castle until they
got married.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in a business built largely on image, such candor is
exceptional. The question of just who designs a collection remains
so sensitive that many designers declined to discuss it at all. A
spokeswoman for Calvin Klein did not return calls about the matter,
and a spokeswoman for Ralph Lauren, declining comment, said, ``This
is too complicated a subject, because there are so many people who
work as assistants in our company.'' A spokeswoman for Richard
Tyler said that the designer and his creative director, Simon
Holloway, were both too busy last week to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   At the root of their reticence may be the need to reinforce the
public perception that a single individual is responsible for the
clothing with a designer's name on it. Matt Nye, a former assistant
to both Lauren and Klein, who recently created his own collection,
said: ``Smaller houses can generate notoriety and revitalize their
image by attaching themselves publicly to a youthful designer. But
in a bigger company, a designer doesn't want that association. It
does him no good. People like Ralph and Calvin are huge
personalities. They're still viable factors in the credibility
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, in fashion, as in other highly competitive industries,
young talent is jealously guarded. ``Fashion is incestuous,'' Nye
said. ``So if you have a very gifted designer, you keep him under
wraps.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as often, however, it is the assistant who elects to stay
behind the scenes, mastering the role of understudy. Damiano
Biello, a Paris-based consultant, who collaborated with Mrs.
Herrera on her latest collection, isn't fazed by his
near-anonymity. ``I'm ambitious and working hard so that one day I
can open my own business,'' he said. ``But first there is a price
to pay, and I am willing to pay it.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of that price includes persisting in a job with hazy
outlines. ``Being an assistant can mean a lot of things _ you can
go get the coffee or you can help make a dress,'' said Robert Funk,
a New York designer and former sample cutter, designer and sounding
board for Zoran, Jackie Rogers and Marc Jacobs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Whether called associate designer, creative director or
designer, the designer's assistant, working alone or as part of a
team of 4 to 40, juggles a roster of jobs, from scouting fabrics,
cutting sample garments and sketching models to running
interference between the design studio, where ideas germinate, and
the sample room, where they take shape.
</P>
<P>
   But the heart of the job is to serve as antennae, picking up
design and cultural signals that one's employer may be too busy, or
too secluded, to note. ``As you get older, you need fresh blood _
you want to look at the world through another pair of eyes,'' said
Diane Von Furstenberg, who named Catharine Malandrino, 35, a
Frenchwoman 16 years her junior, as designer of the DVF Signatures
collection this year.
</P>
<P>
   Established designers like Ms. Von Furstenberg draw on an
ever-changing pool of talent, feeding on the visions their
associates inspire.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are an entry-level assistant, the more naive you are,
the more the designer likes it,'' said Nye, who worked for Lauren
in the early 1990's. ``You might come in one day dressed like Annie
Oakley and on another dressed like a rock climber, and it was,
`Where did you get those cargo pants, that shirt?' You knew that
Ralph would literally like to strip you, physically, mentally and
even emotionally to find out where your heart is at.''
</P>
<P>
   In the climate of relative candor and intimacy that flourishes
at smaller houses, the exchange between designers and assistants is
more like a a tennis game, a volley of ideas so spontaneous that
it's hard to be sure where each originates. But it's still the
designer who has the last word. ``Nothing gets out of here without
Mrs. Herrera seeing it,'' said Biello. He nevertheless pushes
through an idea of his own from time to time, like the leather
jacket that opened Mrs. Herrera's last spring collection. It was
made, at Biello's daring suggestion, in a shade of Barbie doll
pink.
</P>
<P>
   The role of the assistant is often to play provocateur,
espousing quirky or daring ideas that may not fly. But outside the
studio, the assistant acts as chief advocate for an employer's
point of view. ``The assistant is the voice of the designer in the
designer's absence,'' said Lillian von Stauffenberg, Bergdorf
Goodman's fashion director of women's apparel. ``It's up to him to
make sure that we get the designer's vision.''
</P>
<P>
   The design process is often a collaboration among specialists.
``Every one of us has an area of expertise, and the designer draws
on that,'' said John Nickleson, who heads Oscar de la Renta's
design studio.
</P>
<P>
   Tiong Tan, who works for Jackie Rogers, describes the procedure
as a progressive experiment. ``We began last year with one of the
previous season's most successful models, a dress that was gently
draped at the neck,'' he said. Next, Tan, whose specialty is
draping, transformed the garment in stages, drawing a swath of
fabric across the waist, tweaking it and, finally, as Ms. Rogers
beamed approval, letting it fall in a tier to the floor. ``When we
pinned it, we agreed it worked,'' he said. Another hit was born.
</P>
<P>
   Not every garment to reach the runway is the child of such happy
consensus. Natiello recalled surprising his boss, Blass, with a
pair of black lace cargo pants, an item trendier than the designer
might have chosen on his own. ``I knew it!'' Natiello remembers
Blass bellowing with displeasure when he saw the pants. ``Do you
hate it?'' the assistant asked, borrowing one of Blass' pet
phrases. Well no, the designer admitted. And the trousers survived,
appearing on the runway last month.
</P>
<P>
   The assistant may also be responsible for working with
influential private customers. Natiello ``can make or break what
you are wearing,'' said Marin Hopper, the fashion director of Elle
magazine, who often defers to him during private fittings of Blass'
clothes. Such trust is the outgrowth of a camaraderie that extends
beyond the studio. ``We all know each other past 5 o'clock,'' said
Natiello, who fits members of the junior social set by day and
parties with them after hours.
</P>
<P>
   They, in turn, attend Blass' collections. ``We're Craig's
cheering section,'' said Brooke de Ocampo, a friend and one of the
house's youngest clients, adding that she could sometimes detect
Natiello's influence on the runway. ``It might be a square neckline
or just a simple strapless dress,'' she said. ``He understands what
we want: elegant and uncomplicated clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, some assistants feel emboldened to strike out on
their own, opening their own businesses. But the move is always
fraught with professional risk.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Funk, who opened his own design business in 1997 after a
20-year apprenticeship, acknowledges that he was apprehensive.
``It's an adjustment,'' he said. ``I'd been used to expressing
myself through somebody more fabulous. Now, it's like the floor has
fallen out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Being able to reach a customer with my ideas directly is
exciting,'' he added, brightening. ``But you do feel exposed. As an
assistant, I was always hiding in plain sight.''

   WASHINGTON _ The lame-duck pens, as they are rudely known by
some, will be situated in spare office space in the Rayburn House
Office Building, where the 40 members who are not returning to
Congress next year will find temporary desk space on Thursday for
the final and most fateful vote of their careers.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mike Pappas, R-N.J., rebuffed by the voters last month and
physically evicted from his House office suite 10 days ago, has no
need of the Rayburn space. He has a House colleague who will let
him hang his hat as he goes to the floor for the last time, to vote
on impeaching President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``A very somber time,'' said Pappas, who will be closing out
what, in baseball terminology, is a cup-of-coffee career, finished
at the minimal two years of service. He has cast 1,178 votes so
far, but none with such thumbs-up or thumbs-down gravity as that
attending the 105th Congress' grim curtain call.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot look away; we cannot pretend it hasn't happened,''
Pappas said. He spoke from his forced political retirement in New
Jersey's 12th Congressional District and kept his last vote to
himself before heading here for his closing day as a House member.
Pappas talked guardedly, but the sadness of some other lame ducks
is evident as they return for this final bout of debating and
voting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought it would come to this,'' said Vic Fazio,
D-Calif., who chose to retire after an eventful 20-year career
that, he emphasizes, he will cherish forever. ``This vote is not
something that elevates your service here,'' he said quietly.
``It's such a frustrating and wasteful issue, indicating how
polarized the country has become, maybe going back to Watergate.''
</P>
<P>
   Fazio said he tried to spend this year in a kind of electoral
withdrawal of happily savoring the honor of public service. But his
parting mood is devoid of celebration. ``We're at such total
loggerheads,'' he rued of the two sides in the impeachment issue.
</P>
<P>
   Others are angry as much as sad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really resent having to end my career on this vote,'' Louis
Stokes, D-Ohio, who is retiring after 30 years in Congress. ``It's
not pleasant. This will precipitate a crisis in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``My constituents have never been so irate,'' Stokes said as he
prepared to fly back here from Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the impeachment decision, the lame ducks will
gather with their respective party caucuses in momentous farewell
this week. At his final House Republican conference meeting, Pappas
will join in the full emotional flow of the event among his
returning colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Pappas was defeated in November by Rush Holt, a Democrat and
physicist who has never held elective office. Pappas traced his
defeat to a gaffe he committed on the floor of the House, when he
whimsically sung out in praise of Kenneth Starr's impeachment
inquiry into Clinton's sex-and-mendacity scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twinkle, twinkle, Kenneth Starr, now we see how brave you
are,'' Pappas sang last July, and Democrats soon were accusing him
of partisanly trivializing grave events.
</P>
<P>
   July was an eon ago in the political life of the Clinton
scandal, and Pappas claims no comfort in the initial estimates in
this tumultuous week that the president could very well be
impeached by a narrow vote. The situation here is fluid, indeed
sloshing with torrents of vox pop that Pappas and the 39 others who
are leaving cannot adequately sample with their offices closed and
their old phones on taped farewells.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm still accessible,'' he insisted almost achingly. ``I'm
still hearing from the people.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   By his own word, Pappas loved his two years here as much as
Fazio loved his 20 or Stokes his 30. Nothing, not even the
impeachment vote, can spoil the honor and memory of it, Pappas
insisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is a wonderful thing in that we each have our hills and
valleys,'' declared Pappas, a study in humility as he prepares to
vote this last time as a congressman. He retires with the comfort
of a 100 percent attendance record and an obvious belief that human
resilience is at the heart of all politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm keeping my office open,'' said the single-termer,
referring to the ``Pappas for Congress'' storefront in central New
Jersey, and clearly tempted to start running all over again right
now for the chance to come back here after the impeachment vote is
history.

DEMOCRATS' BIG CONTRIBUTOR GETS 5 YEARS' PROBATION
</HEADLINE>

   LOS ANGELES _ Johnny Chung, a prolific donor to Democrats and
frequent visitor to the Clinton White House, was sentenced to
probation and community service Monday for his involvement in
illegal campaign contributions during the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   At the sentencing, U.S. District Judge Manuel Real expressed
doubt over Democratic Party officials' assertions that they did not
know about fund-raising abuses, and said he was ``surprised'' that
Attorney General Janet Reno did not appoint a special prosecutor to
look into them, ``as much as that term has become something of a
pariah.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge, appointed to the bench by President Lyndon Johnson,
said he had reviewed transcripts of Chung's testimony before a
grand jury investigating those accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has said that in making her decision she based it on the
facts and the law and had not found sufficient grounds for
appointing an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Donald Fowler, the former chairman of the
Democratic National Committee, and Richard Sullivan, the
committee's former finance director, the judge added, ``If Fowler
and Sullivan didn't know what was going on, I think they are the
dumbest politicians I've ever seen.'' Rick Hess, a spokesman for
the committee, declined to respond to Real's comments.
</P>
<P>
   Chung, 43, who faced up to 18 months in prison, was granted
leniency following a recommendation by prosecutors and pleas from
his lawyer on the basis of his cooperation with an investigation
into campaign fund-raising abuses during the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   Chung was sentenced to five years' probation and 3,000 hours of
community service. He pleaded guilty to bank fraud, tax evasion and
conspiracy charges, and admitted circumventing individual limits on
donations.

   COURT CONTINUES TO LOOSEN ANTITRUST LAW  (jw) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Continuing a trend toward a more flexible
application of antitrust laws, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously
Monday that an agreement between a purchaser and a supplier to
eliminate a competing supplier was not necessarily illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The decision vacated a ruling by the federal appeals court in
New York in 1996 in a case involving Nynex Corp. and AT&AMP;T
Technologies, a company that removed obsolete telephone-switching
equipment. The appeals court had ruled that an agreement by Nynex
and the AT&AMP;T unit to do business with each other to the exclusion
of a competing removal service could be viewed as a group boycott.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Supreme Court's antitrust precedents, a boycott is an
illegal restraint of trade regardless of the details or
anticompetitive effect of the arrangement. This rule of per se
illegality is in contrast to most other potentially anticompetitive
business arrangements, which may be illegal or not, depending on
whether competition is in fact harmed.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the court, Justice Stephen Breyer said the lower
court's mistake was in viewing the challenged arrangement in this
case as a boycott. A boycott entails an agreement between
competitors, he said, while a decision by a single purchaser to
favor one supplier over another, even for improper purposes, may be
illegal under some other analysis but is not subject to automatic
condemnation as a boycott.
</P>
<P>
   ``The freedom to switch suppliers lies close to the heart of the
competitive process that the antitrust laws seek to encourage,''
Breyer said.
</P>
<P>
   An antitrust specialist who taught the subject for years at
Harvard Law School, Breyer warned that the court should not adopt
an analysis that ``would transform cases involving business
behavior that is improper for various reasons, say, cases involving
nepotism or personal pique, into treble-damages antitrust cases.''
A successful plaintiff's proven damages are ordinarily tripled in
antitrust cases.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations of the 8-year-old lawsuit have not been proved
because there has not been a trial. Under the ruling, the 2nd U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals will now consider other aspects of the
case, including whether the excluded supplier, Discon Inc., can
show that the arrangement was anticompetitive even if not a
boycott.
</P>
<P>
   Discon, which is now defunct, was a low bidder for a contract to
remove old switching equipment for New York Telephone, a Nynex
subsidiary. Discon contended that Nynex, which was bought by Bell
Atlantic last year, used the higher-cost AT&AMP;T Technologies as part
of a conspiracy to get regulatory approval for higher telephone
rates.

GOVERNOR OF PUERTO RICO LOOKS BEYOND FAILED VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MIREYA NAVARRO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, P.R. _ Puerto Rico's pro-statehood governor said on
Monday that he will continue pressing Congress to address what he
termed Puerto Rico's ``colonial'' situation despite a referendum in
which most voters seemed to indicate they did not want change.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Pedro Rossello had hoped to use a statehood victory to prod
Congress into authorizing a binding vote on statehood, but that
effort was set back on Sunday when voters faced with five
alternatives chose ``none of the above.''
</P>
<P>
   That option was promoted by supporters of the current
commonwealth relationship with the United States as a protest
against ballot language that they said unfairly portrayed the
status quo in order to erode its support.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts here say that both anger at an election
process designed by the ruling pro-statehood New Progressive Party
and support for commonwealth helped pushed the vote for ``none of
the above'' to a 50.2 percent majority. However, they also say that
option also sheltered those who feared statehood as too drastic a
change and those resentful of Rossello's style of governing.
</P>
<P>
   The governor himself said he thought voters rejected him more
than the statehood option for decisions such as the sale of a
majority stake of the government-owned telephone company to a
private consortium this year, which led to a bitter strike by
telephone workers.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the interpretation, the vote left clear only that
Puerto Ricans remain sharply split on whether to change their
island's century-old relationship with the United States and that
more than half the electorate does not yet want statehood.
</P>
<P>
   To members of Congress like Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., who regards
commonwealth as a transitional status, Sunday's referendum
underscored ``the necessity of having a congressionally approved
referendum based on a series of choices Congress is prepared to
implement.'' A bill that set the terms for such a vote was approved
by the House this year but stalled in the Senate, where Graham was
among the co-sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Putting the best spin possible on the outcome of Sunday's vote,
Rossello and leaders of his New Progressive Party have claimed
victory for statehood because ``none of the above'' specified no
status preference. Statehood lost to ``none of the above'' 46.5
percent to 50.2 percent but won over three other status options _
independence, which received 2.5 percent of the vote, and the
boycotted commonwealth and ``free association,'' which each got
less than 1 percent. Free association was defined on the ballot as
a form of independence that delegates certain powers, such as
defense, to the United States under treaties.
</P>
<P>
   Rossello said that only statehood, independence and free
association can be considered permanent solutions to a status quo
he and other statehood supporters say deny Puerto Rico's 3.8
million residents the same rights and obligations of American
citizens on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to say: Congress and president, respond to these
results,'' Rossello, speaking at a news conference, said of his
next step. ``We have to push for a final definition, a solution
that is not colonial. A solution that has to ultimately be either
independence or statehood.''
</P>
<P>
   But that urgency is not shared by leaders of the
pro-commonwealth Popular Democratic Party, who called Sunday's vote
a rejection of statehood and of the governor's efforts in
Washington to promote the perception that most Puerto Ricans are
unhappy with the fundamentals of their status. The mayor of San
Juan, Sila Calderon, the Popular Democrats' possible gubernatorial
candidate for 2000, said on Monday that another status referendum
was not a priority for her party at this time and urged the
governor to return to the business of governing the island.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impression that has been given outside Puerto Rico is that
we live in crisis or that we feel like second-class citizens and
that is not so,'' Ms. Calderon said at her own news conference on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Calderon said the party leadership is not against another
vote on self-determination as long as it is ``just'' and three
conditions are met: the sponsorship of Congress, the participation
in the vote of Puerto Ricans on the mainland and definitions of
status options that emerge from a consensus among their proponents.
</P>
<P>
   The definition Popular Democrats prefer for their status,
however, has been deemed unrealistic by some in Congress. The
party, for instance, has proposed more self-governing powers for
Puerto Rico to foster economic development.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Ricans are American citizens who are governed by federal
law, including the military draft. But they do not pay federal
taxes, cannot vote in federal elections or elect congressional
delegations and do not receive federal benefits comparable to the
states.
</P>
<P>
   Some voters said that is good enough for them. ``I think we're
doing very well and will continue to do very well with what we've
got,'' said Josi Millan, 64, a retiree who voted for ``none of the
above'' to support the status quo. ``I voted to stay the way we
are, to keep our language, our culture, the Latinismo, and the
ability to participate in all the pageants and sporting events.''
</P>
<P>
   Statehood proponents, however, vowed to continue their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have shed bloodshed for the country,'' Charles Rodriguez,
president of Puerto Rico's Senate, said, referring to Puerto Rican
participation in American wars. ``We'll keep on fighting until we
get equality for Puerto Rico.''
</P>
<P>
   But because Congress is also sharply divided about what to do
about the island, many here doubt the United States would ever
admit Puerto Rico into the union. To some, the ``free association''
option, may offer a way out.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long run Puerto Rico will remain split 50-50 against
annexation,'' said Juan Manuel Garcia Passalacqua, a longtime
political analyst here. ``The United States will have to decide
whether they'll admit the 50 percent. There's no other way out of
the Quebec syndrome than free association.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has a Quebec syndrome,'' he said. ``It's
called the Hispanic state.''

WHITE HOUSE CRITICIZES GOP LEADERS FOR REFUSING CENSURE VOTE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
and NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With an impeachment vote looming in the House,
President Clinton's support among Republican moderates softened
Monday as the White House criticized GOP leaders for refusing to
allow a vote to censure the president and avoid trial in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, during a meeting in the Gaza Strip with Palestinian
President Yasser Arafat, warned that the process aimed at removing
him from office was not in the public interest and offered to
consider ``any reasonable compromise'' with Congress to end the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, polls released Monday indicated that although a
majority of Americans believe Clinton lied under oath, they do not
want him impeached. At the same time, a majority says that, if the
House votes to impeach him late this week, the president should
resign rather than face a Senate trial over his effort to cover up
his affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The full House is to meet Thursday to begin debating impeachment
of the president, deliberations that have not occurred in 130
years. Four articles of impeachment accusing Clinton of perjury,
obstruction of justice and abuse of power were approved in
party-line votes by the House Judiciary Committee, which built its
case against the president mostly on evidence developed by
independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Before formally ending its inquiry Saturday, the
Republican-controlled committee rejected efforts by Democrats to
send the full House a resolution rebuking the president. That
resolution of censure, an alternative to impeachment, has been
embraced by the president and several Republican moderates who are
being wooed by the White House in an effort to end the impeachment
process.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., signaled that he was
backing away from his anti-impeachment stand announced more than a
week ago. He asked for and was granted a meeting with Clinton when
he returns from the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to vote today, I would vote against impeachment, but
I am troubled by the president's statements and his continued
inability to tell the American people the truth,'' Shays said.
</P>
<P>
   Also boding ill for Clinton's chance of fending off impeachment
in the House were announcements by Reps. Frank LoBiondo of New
Jersey and Jim Walsh of New York, both of whom were on the White
House list of potential impeachment opponents, that they would
instead vote to send the president's case to the Senate for trial.
</P>
<P>
   With Republicans holding 228 of the 435 House seats, Clinton's
ability to avoid a Senate trial would require winning all 206
Democratic votes, the lone independent and at least a dozen
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   So far, five moderate Republicans, including Shays, have said
they would support the president. At the same time, three Democrats
have said they will vote for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders, including House Majority Leader Dick Armey
of Texas, Whip Tom DeLay of Texas and Judiciary Committee Chairman
Henry Hyde of Illinois, called for Clinton's resignation Sunday.
The three leaders have been urging GOP members to vote against an
anticipated procedural move by Democrats to raise censure as an
alternative to impeachment during Thursday's debate.
</P>
<P>
   In Gaza during a press conference with Arafat, Clinton said it
is not ``in the interest of the United States or the American
people to go through this impeachment process with a trial in the
Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   The president added that he has ``offered to make every effort
to make any reasonable compromise with the Congress. I still
believe that and I'm still willing to do that. That's all I know to
do. Meanwhile, I'm going to keep working at my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if it was appropriate for Republicans to call for his
resignation while he was overseas, Clinton said: ``The boundaries
of what's appropriate have been changed rather dramatically over
the past few months. They'll have to be the judge of their own
conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Vice President Al Gore said Republicans were
defying ``the wisdom of the American people'' in refusing to
consider censure. Regarding calls by Armey, DeLay and Hyde for
Clinton to resign, Gore said: ``That's not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart was sharper in his criticism
of Republican leaders who, he said, have rewritten the book on
partisanship. They are blocking a censure vote, he said, because
they know it has a strong chance of passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a small group of the Republican leadership who have
made it their mission in life to remove the president against
perhaps the will of the House but certainly against the will of the
American public,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   A survey over the weekend by the Pew Research Center found
two-thirds of American adults oppose impeaching Clinton or removing
him from office. A CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll released Monday
indicates that six in 10 Americans oppose impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   An ABC News/Washington Post poll found a similar number of
Americans opposed to impeachment, but found an almost equal number,
58 percent, saying that if he is impeached by the House, Clinton
should resign rather than fight for his job in a Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   While half of the adults surveyed by Pew said they are not happy
with his handling of the investigation into his affair with
Lewinsky, 61 percent approve of the job he is doing as president, a
number that has remained fairly constant since January. Sixty
percent of those in the Pew survey disapproved of the way
Republicans have handled impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Clinton allies have intensified efforts to encourage
voters to contact their congressional representatives to oppose
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson said he will hold a ``prayer vigil''
outside the Capitol on Thursday as lawmakers inside debate the
impeachment articles.
</P>
<P>
   People for the American Way began airing radio advertisements
providing a toll-free telephone line that will route them to their
lawmakers' office. Before the ads began airing, the phone-in
campaign produced more than 130,000 calls against impeachment, the
liberal civil liberties group said.
</P>
<P>
   Phone lines to Capitol offices rang off the hook Monday with
calls on the issue. Calls to the main Capitol switchboard doubled
from their usual volume, a House spokesman said, and calls to many
member offices produced recordings that all circuits were busy.

   QUEBEC _ On dark days when the river broods and mists hang heavy
on outlying hills, it is easy to think of Quebec as it once was, a
distant outpost of the British Empire where hardy people dreamed of
doing great things that would not soon be forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what they did has withstood the tides of time, because
for the last 174 years, the Literary and Historical Society of
Quebec has dedicated itself to preserving the memories and
achievements of the early settlers of one of North America's oldest
cities.
</P>
<P>
   These days, however, it is the society itself that is most in
need of preservation.
</P>
<P>
   English-speaking people have been in the minority here since the
British conquered the French in 1759. But they thrived until about
30 years ago, when the first stirrings of the independence movement
in Quebec Province made them start to feel unwelcome.
</P>
<P>
   Now, fewer than 2 percent of the 167,000 inhabitants of the city
of Quebec consider themselves native English speakers. A great
number of the rest regard institutions like the society, one of
North America's oldest, as uncomfortable reminders of Quebec's
colonial past.
</P>
<P>
   That the society's library is seen as a vestige of British power
is one reason that something as seemingly innocent as a literary
fund-raiser recently became a cause celebre.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when the Lit &AMP; His, as its devotees know it,
was a learned society. In the days long before commercial
publishing companies and research organizations, the society
undertook scholarly and scientific investigations. But it hasn't
published anything for more than 70 years; its primary focus now is
its 35,000-volume library, housed in an old prison building on St.
Stanislas Street in what is left of the English Quarter of Quebec.
The books are overwhelmingly in English.
</P>
<P>
   Membership in the private library has dropped to about 300,
while the cost of maintaining the old books, and occasionally
buying new ones, has grown burdensome. A nearly century-old
investment fund generates some support but not nearly enough.
</P>
<P>
   So in October, library directors invited the Montreal novelist
Mordecai Richler to read from his latest work. It would be a
literary event, and, it was hoped, raise some badly needed money.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Quebec officially supports the library, providing
space and a grant of $1,500 a year. But when Mayor Jean-Paul
L'Allier heard about Richler's visit, he called the invitation
``clumsy'' because of the author's curmudgeonly opposition to
Quebec's independence movement.
</P>
<P>
   Richler, who alternates between London and Montreal, said he
agreed to take part because he had heard about the library's
plight, not because he thought Canada should stick together. But
what he found at the library that night surprised him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got there I asked the organizers if they had publicized
much, and they told me no,'' Richler said, still taken aback by how
small the crowd had been, just a few dozen. ``They said they didn't
want to attract too many people.''
</P>
<P>
   Walk over the creaking wooden floors and through the narrow
aisles between towering bookcases and it becomes clear that the Lit
&AMP; His library is not a place that brooks much folderol. Most of the
books on the gracious first floor are old. Those up on the
mezzanine are really old.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's 19th century or older we just don't let it
circulate,'' said Sylviane Dubois, librarian for the last 12 years.
Books from the 1920s and 1930s are common, and they do circulate,
at least in theory. One chosen at random, ``A Thousand Lines,'' by
Martin Farquhar Tupper, was last checked out on March 12, 1940.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest books are kept in a glass case, locked with a
skeleton key. Before she opens it Ms. Dubois rushes back to her
desk for a pair of white gloves. ``You need it to protect the books
and to protect yourself,'' she said. The oldest books, dating to
the 17th century, sometimes carry irritating mold.
</P>
<P>
   It would be difficult to trace the slow ebbing of time in a
place like this. There's not a computer terminal, Internet screen
or copy machine anywhere in sight. The old card catalog still does
just fine.
</P>
<P>
   But don't get the idea that the library is totally resistant to
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not opposed to progress right across the board,''
insisted Tomas Feininger, a geologist who is president of the
society. He conceded that there are some things computers are
pretty good at, like indexing, and said the library was thinking of
using one to organize the material in the Canadiana collection.
</P>
<P>
   Egad, a computer! ``But of course it won't ever be in this
room,'' Feininger said, snugly seated in the main reading room.
``It would hidden off somewhere in a corner, where it belongs.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently the Lit &AMP; His undertook a rare renovation, moving the
main doors back some 20 feet to make room for the rapidly expanding
large type books that have become popular as the society's
membership ages.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is not a place just for codgers. Michael Bath, 42,
showed up one afternoon with his 5-year-old daughter, Emilie. Bath,
a transplanted Ontarian who fell in love with Quebec and married a
Quebecois, stops by every month for an armload of books.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I moved to Quebec it took me about a year to find out
about the library from other Anglophones,'' he said. ``It's a
wonderful place to come and feel history.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeting the society's $38,000 annual budget requires all sorts
of inventiveness. At the beginning of the year, the library
auctions off magazine subscriptions. The high bidder gets to take
all the old issues when new ones come in.
</P>
<P>
   On her desk, Ms. Dubois always keeps a stack of old books that
need repair. (``They're not difficult to find here,'' she said.)
Every once in a while, a retired bookbinder, Jacques Roy, quietly
peeks in. He takes what's there, and if he likes the books he reads
them, repairs them and brings them back.
</P>
<P>
   The Lit &AMP; His will celebrate its 175th anniversary in 1999. In
all that time, Quebec has seen many changes. But a small group of
English speakers and their French-speaking friends in this
beautiful walled city on the St. Lawrence River can count on some
things never to change. And that in itself represents a small
victory over that old enemy, time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are moving into a virtual age where wood is being replaced
by melamine, letters are being replaced by electrons, and so on,''
Feininger said. ``This place is becoming more and more unique
because it's reality, so to speak. And an awful lot of people
appreciate that.''

ENERGY DEPARTMENT MOVES TO SETTLE COMPLAINTS OVER WEAPONS CLEANUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Energy Department Monday promised to establish
a $6.25 million fund for environmental groups, community
organizations and Indian tribes to spend on technical and
scientific analyses of the department's cleanup work at nuclear
weapons manufacturing sites, and to create a huge Internet database
about the sites' radioactive and chemical contamination.
</P>
<P>
   The department took the unusual actions to avoid being found in
contempt of court in a 1989 lawsuit by environmentalists over how
the weapons complex cleanup would be handled.
</P>
<P>
   The department settled the suit in 1990 by promising to perform
a ``programmatic environmental impact statement'' that would weigh
every alternative at all sites in the cleanup program. The program
is expected to take decades and cost hundreds of billions of
dollars. In 1995, the department canceled the analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Anne Sullivan, the department's general counsel, said
Monday that the new settlement, which includes providing research
money to groups that have opposed the department for more than a
decade, would help accomplish the cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think if people are better informed about our work, they're
more likely to agree with us,'' she said in a telephone briefing
with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   And, said Ms. Sullivan, one of the major users of a unified,
well-organized database would be the Energy Department itself,
which sometimes has trouble keeping track of what it knows about
its sprawling complex of weapons production and energy research
sites, many of them now shuttered.
</P>
<P>
   She said the department's effort to study all the sites
together, which it abandoned in 1995, was not useful because each
site was different.
</P>
<P>
   Another department official, James Werner, director of the
office of strategic planning and analysis, said he thought the new
settlement ``will have a clear impact on helping improve waste
management, just understanding the data.''
</P>
<P>
   Werner himself illustrates how the Energy Department has changed
from the days when nuclear weapons were still widely produced and
the department, and its predecessor, the Atomic Energy Commission,
kept everything secret. When the first agreement was made, Werner
was an environmental engineer with the Natural Resources Defense
Council, one of the plaintiffs in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of some of the 38 environmental and other
nonprofit groups that sued the Energy Department said this was the
first time they knew of that the department had agreed to pay for
such outside research.
</P>
<P>
   They also said they believed the agreement Monday was better
than the 1990 settlement, because the environmental impact
statements the department was producing under the original deal
were late and low-quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``They merely go through the motions, they don't do the
comprehensive, thorough analysis of the alternatives,'' said Robert
Schaeffer, director of the Alliance for Nuclear Accountability, an
umbrella group representing several plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department has declassified millions of pages of
files in the last few years. The new database will not include any
classified or secret information.

 &HT;    Q and A: Tobacco will fight ban `like the devil,' counsel says
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pinetops, N.C. lawyer Phil Carlton has represented Big Tobacco
in two rounds of negotiations over a national tobacco settlement. A
$368.5 billion deal died in Congress last summer, after the tobacco
industry fought legislation that would have increased industry
payments to $516 billion over 25 years. Last month, 46 states,
including Georgia, agreed to a $206 billion settlement that imposes
fewer marketing restrictions on cigarette makers. Carlton, 61, a
former North Carolina Supreme Court justice, talked about tobacco's
future .
</P>
<P>
   Q: The White House and health advocates have urged Congress to
enact tobacco control legislation next year that goes beyond the
recent $206 billion settlement. How would the tobacco industry view
broader legislation?
</P>
<P>
   A: With all those people who want to put the companies out of
business stirring, you have to assume there may be some activity. I
am sure (health advocates) will ask for the authority to ban the
product, and we will fight that like the devil. I think the
national settlement agreement with the states has taken a lot of
steam out of it. You can't take billboards down but once, and we've
already agreed to take them down.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some months ago, former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop
used the word ``bluffing'' in reference to the industry and its
threat to back out of the proposed $368 billion settlement. But the
industry wasn't bluffing. Did the health advocates simply blow
their best shot by pressing for more than the $368 billion?
</P>
<P>
   A: Absolutely. It is just that simple. If you think about where
we would be today if the $368 billion and everything in that June
20, 1997, agreement had been enacted, just think how peaceful life
would have been for the past year. They would have had everything
they ever dreamed of having. As it is, we are still fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A major goal of the White House and health advocates was to
curb youth smoking. When cigarette billboards come down and other
requirements of the recent settlement are in place, do you expect
youth smoking to go down?
</P>
<P>
   A: I never have thought that advertising had a lot to do with
it. I think the more adult you make the product, the more
intriguing it becomes to young people. I do believe that a
combination of . . . price increases, advertising restrictions and
so forth may help some, but I obviously don't think it will help as
much as they do. Actually, I don't think they do, either. I still
think what they want is prohibition.

FOR GOLDMAN, A 4TH QUARTER TO FORGET
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The old snapshots of Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
tell the story. In his days as rising star and then chairman of
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., Rubin was usually pictured cheek-by-jowl with
traders on the crowded bond floor, in shirt sleeves, a phone to his
ear. The private partnership he helped build has long had a
seat-of-the-pants management style that makes some Wall Street
competitors seem timid.
</P>
<P>
   These days, though, timidity might sound tempting to the
partners at Goldman. The firm said Monday that its pretax profit
fell 81 percent to $107 million in the fourth quarter _ the worst
such period it has had since 1994 _ and attributed the weak results
exclusively to trading losses. Earnings were down from $567 million
in the fourth quarter of last year, and off 86 percent from the
$754 million it posted in this year's third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman's results showed how the firm's aggressive emphasis on
trading _ both for its customers and for its own account _ can
cause steep losses in down markets as surely as it can magnify
profits in good ones. That makes Goldman's earnings more volatile
than those of some competitors and seems likely to further postpone
the day that it becomes a public company.
</P>
<P>
   The miserable final period derailed the stellar earnings
momentum Goldman had built up in its first half, when it earned
more than $1 billion each quarter and prepared to sell shares in
the firm for the first time in its 130-year history. For the year,
Goldman earned $2.92 billion, down from $3.01 billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Changes already are underway. Its co-chairmen and chief
executives, Jon S. Corzine and Henry M. Paulson Jr., said they had
reduced the firm's risk profile and renewed their emphasis on
expanding investment banking and money-management businesses, which
remained highly profitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We freely admit that we have a strategy to shift our earnings
mix more towards banking and asset management,'' Paulson said. For
that reason, he said, Goldman raised its budget for recruiting new
investment bankers by 9 percent this year, when some rivals are
cutting back. Goldman has also recently poached some mergers and
acquisition stars from Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter and Citigroup's
Salomon Smith Barney unit.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Goldman's trading losses came in September and October,
when stocks and especially bonds took a beating worldwide. Markets
have stabilized since then, but Goldman says it is taking no
chances on a repeat of a trading period that Corzine called the
worst he had seen.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, who like Rubin worked his way to the executive suite
from the bond-trading floor, said that Goldman had greatly shrunk
the size of its balance sheet, or its assets and liabilities. In
effect, that means it is using much less borrowed money to trade
securities. Most of that cut _ Corzine said it came to a third to a
half of the firm's pre-September balance sheet _ took place in
October and November, when the firm sold trading positions at a
loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are battening down the hatches for another storm,'' Hal
Schroeder, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods, said. ``They are
taking some losses, but they see it as a long-term preservation
move.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Trading losses have not been unusual on Wall Street recently.
Merrill Lynch, Bankers Trust and Salomon Smith Barney posted
hundreds of millions of dollars in such losses in the third
quarter, which ended a month later than Goldman's third quarter.
The sharp downturn in bond markets around the world and sharp
recessions in emerging markets were the main culprits.
</P>
<P>
   But Goldman is more trading-oriented than any of those firms.
The investment bank earned nearly half its profits in the first
half of the year from trading on behalf of customers and with its
own capital, a much higher share than either Merrill or Morgan
Stanley, its top peers.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman powered ahead of its rivals this year in the two areas
that are the most profitable for investment banks: advising
companies on mergers and acquisitions and underwriting initial
public offerings. Even so, the downturn in bonds in the fall
dragged down its overall results.
</P>
<P>
   The firm lost heavily in making what it called relative value
trades, which try to exploit what are seen as temporary price
disparities between two similar stocks or bonds. It also lost money
trading bonds in the United States, Paulson said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, its trading profile was in some ways similar to that of
Long-Term Capital Management, the hedge fund that Goldman and 13
other banks and brokerage houses rescued from bankruptcy in
September. Goldman itself was hit by the shock-induced flight from
risky securities that undercut the value of virtually all bonds
except U.S. Treasuries. And it was hurt all the more because so
many hedge funds and securities firms pursued similar trading
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our risk model did not take into account enough the copy-cat
problem,'' Paulson said. ``Everyone has similar positions and in a
liquidity crisis is forced to reduce at the same times.''
</P>
<P>
   The earnings instability is most likely to push back the day
Goldman revives its plans for a public offering. November was a
profitable month, and December looks good so far, Corzine said. But
he did not rule out the possibility that future shocks, from an
impeachment of President Clinton or fresh instability in Russia,
for example, could send markets down sharply again.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the greatest base on which to do an offering,'' he
said. ``So I expect it will be some time to run before we seriously
consider it again.''

Somehow I doubt we'll ever hear Beck or Sheryl Crow immortalize any
of today's baseball players in a pop song the way Paul Simon did
Joe DiMaggio in Mrs. Robinson. Why would they? What baseball player

that a succeeding generation would bemoan his loss, and beckon to

 &HT;    Jasper murder trial may leave Jasper
 &HT;    By Denise Gamino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas - A white man accused of dragging a black man to
death had only one friend show up in court Monday ``after a bunch
of people'' decided to stay away to testify that this East Texas
town can't give him a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge Joe Bob Golden said he would rule today on
whether to move John William ``Bill'' King's Jan. 25 murder trial
to another city. He also may rule on whether to allow television
cameras in the courtroom and public access to evidence.
</P>
<P>
   King, wearing a white prison T-shirt that exposed his elaborate
tattoos that authorities say depict white supremacy symbols, sat
stone-faced at the defense table. Just 10 feet away, the father and
sisters of murder victim James Byrd Jr. watched the court hearing
from a front-row seat. King never looked their way.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd was dragged behind a pickup until he was dismembered in the
early hours of June 7. King and two other white men are accused of
killing Byrd because he was black.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors presented five Jasper County witnesses who said the
worldwide media coverage of the murder would not prevent a fair and
impartial trial here.
</P>
<P>
   But King's lawyer found only one King family friend to testify
against a hometown trial along with a Jasper lawyer who testified
only because he was under subpoena. The judge even called a short
recess to allow King's lawyer to telephone people who had pledged
to testify for a change of venue, but who did not appear.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a bunch of people who for some reason felt
uncomfortable in coming,'' C. Haden ``Sonny'' Cribbs, Jr. of
Beaumont, the court-appointed attorney for King, said during a
break. ``We had a hard time getting people, I'll be honest with
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Jasper homemaker Nelda Woods, a longtime friend of King's
family, said, ``There's too many people here already, judging from
what I've heard.''
</P>
<P>
   As she left the witness stand, King flashed her a soft smile and
then resumed his day-long position of resting his elbows on the
defense table and holding his clenched hands to his chin.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray presented news
stories from the Austin American-Statesman, the Houston Chronicle
and the Dallas Morning News to support his contention that readers
across the state were told more details of the crime than local
residents.
</P>
<P>
   He said the papers had written more extensively than local
papers about King's tattoos and allegations of blood on his shoes.
Local residents have heard less provocative information than
big-city residents, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not entitled to change of venue because of publicity,''
James said during a break. ``It has to be inflammatory publicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors and Cribbs agreed the jury should be sequestered
during King's trial, but the judge has not yet ruled.
</P>
<P>
   King, 24, is accused of being the ringleader of the gruesome
attack on Byrd. His cigarette lighter _ inscribed with his
nickname, ``Possum,'' and a triangle formed by the letters KKK _
was found on the road where Byrd was killed.
</P>
<P>
   King claims he is innocent. Last month, he released a letter
through his father in which he blames Byrd's death on Shawn Berry,
one of his co-defendants who owned the pickup used to drag Byrd.
King said he was at home when Byrd was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Berry and Lawrence Russell Brewer have also been charged with
capital murder, but their trials have not been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   During Monday's hearing, King's disabled father sat in a
wheelchair with a portable oxygen tank to help him breath. His
severe osteoporosis and respiratory problems would prevent him from
attending an out-of-town trial for his son, but he supports a
change of venue. ``I want things to be as good on my boy as
possible,'' he said, adding that he loves his son and wants to
believe he did not kill Byrd. ``It's been hell on me,'' he said.
``I've cried and carried on.''
</P>
<P>
   The elder King, a retired lumber worker, lives in Jasper, just
four blocks from the Byrd family, although he never has met them.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the case is over and done with and settled with, I'd
like to be able to sit down and talk with them,'' he said. ``It's
impossible now.''

ALIOTTI ON THE DEFENSIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Oregon's 1995 Rose Bowl berth was one of the
happiest moments in Nick Aliotti's life. He had masterminded the
Ducks' Gang Green defense, building it practically from scratch,
and was considered one of the best defensive coordinators in the
Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, Aliotti is again coaching a Rose Bowl defense
_ but without the nickname and certainly without the joy.
</P>
<P>
   In his first season as UCLA's defensive guru, Aliotti is under
siege. His defense ranks 99th in the nation and was largely
responsible for the Bruins' 49-45 loss at Miami. His methods have
been questioned by his head coach. His job security is the hot
topic within the Morgan Center and he is not answering the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been the toughest season of my coaching career and
it's not even close,'' Aliotti said last week. ``It's tough, but
I've got to get my head out of the toilet and move on. There's
never been anything close to this.''
</P>
<P>
   Aliotti is his own harshest critic, but Bruins coach Bob Toledo
is a close second. In November, after horrific defensive
performances against Stanford and Oregon State, Toledo publicly
criticized Aliotti's strategy and methods. Last week, when asked to
assess Aliotti's future, Toledo offered no support and said he'd
evaluate the situation after the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``That upset me,'' Aliotti said. ``Wouldn't it upset you?''
</P>
<P>
   So Aliotti dangled. His defense was ridiculed throughout the
Pac-10, across the nation and within his own locker room. Every
finger, every ounce of blame, it seemed, was pointed at the
44-year-old coordinator with a husky voice and no answers.
</P>
<P>
   Until last week. That's when Toledo returned from a four-day
recruiting trip, reviewed film and revised his position. Saturday,
he gave Aliotti a vote of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the scheme or the alignments, it was the execution
of the system,'' Toledo said. ``I think we're doing the right
things, I really do. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel better after watching the video. If it had been poor
alignments and true coaching problems, I'd be more concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Watch the game five times or 50 and there's only one
conclusion:The Bruins could not tackle. They could not execute the
most fundamental principle of defense. Time after time, they were
in position to stop Hurricanes tailback Edgerrin James and let him
slip away. They did not shed blocks and they did not make plays.
For that, fairly or unfairly, Aliotti has accepted the blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody lives in my shoes but me,'' he said. ``It's hard to
fathom.''
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, Aliotti stepped into the most difficult situation for
a defensive coordinator: mixing a new system with a young defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have two senior starters and two junior starters.
Their three best linemen are true freshmen. Seventy-five percent of
the linebackers and 50 percent of the secondary are second-year
players, either redshirt freshmen or sophomores. At times against
Miami, they had eight freshmen and sophomores on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``What went wrong is what we said at the start, we're young and
inexperienced,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins endured the same trouble in 1996, when first-year
coordinator Rocky Long installed his unconventional system. With a
slew of sophomores and juniors, UCLA ranked near the bottom of the
Pac-10 in total defense (370 yards) and scoring defense (29
points).
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you put in a new system, you have to anticipate
growing pains,'' said Long, who left UCLA last winter to become the
head coach at New Mexico. ``There's a learning curve you have to go
through. It happened in 1996 and I'm sure it happened this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only people who really understand the process are the
coaches. Even the players don't realize what a difficult transition
it is. I can sympathize with Nick. People can get impatient, but
he's a good coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Aliotti is well-regarded within coaching circles and would be
hired in a nanosecond if he left UCLA. But he seemingly
miscalculated on several fronts this season, which partly explains
UCLA's average points (27.5) and yards (432.5) allowed.
</P>
<P>
   His system is based on blitzing the quarterback, playing
man-to-man coverage and _ here's the kicker _ reacting to offensive
personnel. The Bruins don't line up and play. According to
cornerback Marques Anderson, they line up, read the offensive
personnel and formation, then process their assignments.
</P>
<P>
   It worked at Oregon and it worked with the St. Louis Rams, where
Aliotti spent three seasons. But the Bruins don't have NFL talent
executing the scheme and they don't have an all-conference
cornerback like ex-Duck Alex Molden playing man-to-man coverage.
</P>
<P>
   As Toledo noted last month, Aliotti didn't temper the scheme to
suit the personnel. He seemed to be coaching a system the young
Bruins could not process.
</P>
<P>
   ``His scheme is good, it's sound,'' Anderson said. ``There are a
lot of details and it takes time to have to master the defense,
almost become scholars, and you just can't learn a new system in 2{
months. This year was a learning experience for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to Toledo believe he'll welcome Aliotti back for
1999 if Aliotti agrees to tweak the system, emphasize fundamentals
and use more zone coverage. For one thing, they're good friends,
having coached together at Oregon in 1988. In addition, Toledo
understands the combustible combination of youth and a system
change, having endured the same problems with UCLA's offense in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, the currents of history are at work.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, needing a scapegoat for several disappointing Cotton
Bowls, Texas A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum fired his offensive coordinator
_ an energetic, creative play caller named Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   It was, of course, a disastrous move. Toledo has built one of
the nation's most dynamic offenses at UCLA, and the Aggies haven't
moved the ball consistently in four seasons. Last year, Slocum
acknowledged his gaffe. Toledo probably doesn't want to make the
same mistake. &UR; !dlim! &LR; !end!

MARKET SHRUGS OFF CLINTON DILEMMA, BUT DOW DROPS 126 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER G. GOSSELIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ US stocks tumbled again Monday, with the Dow Jones
industrial average losing more than 126 points as hundreds of
companies warned that slowing growth and overseas troubles were
damaging their ability to make money.
</P>
<P>
   In its focus on money-making, Wall Street seemed curiously tone
deaf to the renewed controversy surrounding Bill Clinton and to the
rapidly rising chances that he will become only the second
president in American history to be impeached. The House is
scheduled to debate four articles of impeachment Thursday stemming
from Clinton's affair with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky and from his efforts to hide the liaison.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts conceded that financial markets would be deeply shaken
if Clinton were actually driven from office, but argued variously
that a House Judiciary Committee decision to send impeachment
articles to the full House was merely procedural, that House
Republicans are bluffing in their talk about removing the
president, and that the impeachment effort will die in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of old music,'' said Michael W. Clark, head of US
equities trading at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York.
</P>
<P>
   What attracted investment professionals' attention instead of
impeachment was word that Mattel Inc. will miss its annual profit
target by a wide margin because of declining sales to retailers.
Shares of the world's largest toymaker plunged 8 1/8 to 22, their
steepest drop in 16 years and enough to trim $2.5 billion from the
firm's market value. The company also announced it will buy
Learning Co. of Cambridge, Mass. in a $3.2 billion stock deal.
</P>
<P>
   In saying it won't make its profits target, Mattel became the
latest of hundreds of companies to warn they will disappoint
investors on earnings, and it renewed fears that the stock market's
recent recovery had been built on little more than thin air.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on track for a record number of negative
pre-announcements,'' said Charles L. Hill, research director for
First Call Corp. in Boston, which tracks corporate earnings.
Pre-announcements are the way companies warn about profits in
advance of releasing the actual numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Profit worries have been eating at investors since late
November, when the market hit new highs. Analysts said these
warnings are largely responsible for trimming the Dow's value by
more than 7 percent since its Nov. 24 peak. The well-known market
measure is still up almost 10 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Those worries took an especially heavy toll Monday on technology
stocks, which had been among the big winners in the market's
recovery from its earlier stumble this fall. The computer-laden
Nasdaq Composite index lost 62.59 points, or 3.1 percent, to close
at 1966.92
</P>
<P>
   Computer titans like IBM, Microsoft, and Intel all lost ground.
IBM shares fell 5 1/8 to 162 7/8. Microsoft stock shed 6 1/16 to
close at 127 15/16. Intel dropped 4 7/8 to 11 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   The losses in high-tech shares follow a recent trading frenzy
that pushed up the sector far beyond what many market watchers
consider to be realistic levels.
</P>
<P>
   Some Internet stocks have doubled since October, although
they've yet to turn a profit. The Nasdaq itself spiraled 60 percent
from Oct. 8 to Dec. 8, according to Bill Meehan, chief market
analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   For the day, the Dow was off 126.16 points, or 1.4 percent, to a
six-week low of 8695.60. Declining issues outnumbered advancers by
an 11-to-4 ratio on the New York Stock Exchange, with 2,283 up, 828
down and 455 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume totaled 887.04 million shares, vs. 823.9 million in
the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 25.28 points, or
2.2 percent, to close at 1141.18.
</P>
<P>
   The American Stock Exchange composite index fell 9.77 to 647.99,
and the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was off 7.43 to
387.94.

 &HT;    Mariners a no-show in trade talks with Reds
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Because Cincinnati Reds general manager Jim
Bowden likes to shoot for the moon, he has been left with his feet
firmly entrenched on Planet Earth on the trade market during
baseball's winter meetings in the vastness of The Opryland Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Better he should have spent his time with wife, Amy, perusing
the many specialty shops under the glass roof at the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds and Seattle Mariners met twice Sunday, with talks
centering on right fielder Reggie Sanders. Another meeting was
scheduled for 10 a.m. Monday, but the Mariners didn't show.
</P>
<P>
   ``No reason to show,'' said one Seattle executive. ``What else
is new? Not only did Bowden want top prospects, he wanted our top
prospect. For Reggie Sanders? I think not.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's top prospect is 6-10 left-handed pitcher Ryan
Anderson, billed as The Young Unit, the next Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Mariners turned to the New York Mets for outfield
help, acquiring Butch Huskey for 20-year-old relief pitcher Lesli
Brea out of Class A.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he stood-up Bowden, Seattle general manager Woody
Woodward said, ``Have our talks been productive? No, but with
Bowden there is always the possibility he'll wheel and deal, that's
for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds and St. Louis Cardinals met Monday morning to talk
about the perceived excess of Cincinnati pitching, but the
Cardinals were told Pete Harnisch and Denny Neagle are no-nos.
Barry Larkin's name came up, too, but Bowden left the impression he
doesn't really want to trade Larkin.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know who I want for Larkin?'' Bowden told St. Louis
general manager Walt Jocketty and manager Tony La Russa. That would
be outfielder J.D. Drew and pitcher Rick Ankiel, two St. Louis
untouchables.
</P>
<P>
   Said one Cardinal official, ``Bowden made it clear he doesn't
want to trade Larkin by the demands he makes and by the fact he
pointed out to us that Larkin's contract would have to be
re-negotiated if the Reds traded him.''
</P>
<P>
   Larkin denies that the possibility of having his contract
re-negotiated is the reason he wants to be traded.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, this year's meetings continued on the same path they
were on in the early 1990s, before commissioner Bud Selig pulled
the plug on them after 1992. Instead of trades, free-agent signings
dominated.
</P>
<P>
   Against Selig's wishes, the meetings were revived this year . .
. and it's the same thing. Selig didn't attend and he was correct.
</P>
<P>
   The only significant player transaction was the crater-making
seven-year, $105 million free-agent signing of pitcher Kevin Brown
by the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds had the third biggest announcement _ the signing of
pitcher Steve Avery to a one-year, $1.5 million contract. The Mets
signed Rickey Henderson to a $1.8 million deal.
</P>
<P>
   Trades? Few. Three minor deals.
</P>
<P>
   Left hanging was the eventual destination of pitcher Roger
Clemens, who has been promised a trade by the Toronto Blue Jays. He
is scheduled to make $16 million over the next two years, but he
wants that re-negotiated by his new team to a three-year $43.5
million deal, which would put him close to Brown's $15 million a
year.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the New York Yankees are in the forefront with
Clemens, causing one American League scout to say, ``The Denver
Broncos were trying to win all their NFL games, now the Yankees are
trying to win all their games.'' The Indians talked with the Blue
Jays most of Monday, but it is believed the Yankees planned to stop
the Tribe from acquiring Clemens by topping anything the Indians
offer.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden is one of the small-market people howling over the
Brown-Clemens absurdity, but he understands. In fact, he was
runner-up to Kevin Malone for the L.A. general manager's job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't blame Malone or manager Davey Johnson,'' Bowden said.
``If I had been GM of the Dodgers and they wanted me to spend $90
million a year on salaries, I'd do it, even though I don't think
it's fiscally responsible. Heck, I'd spend $250 million a year _
and owner Rupert Murdoch can do that _ acquire all the All-Stars
and win 150 games and lose 12 . . . and that would be fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson agrees. While everybody talks about parity, Johnson
flatly says, ``Parity isn't the American way. The American way is
to dominate.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden, though, is frustrated by the lack of trade prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of deals Monday fell apart and died, so we threw away
the life support and here we sit in our rooms,'' Bowden said. ``We
wanted to do more. But we'll all just get in our cars and on planes
and go home. Two clubs expressed interest in Barry Larkin (St.
Louis, Seattle), but neither offered quality big-league players or
top-notch prospects. We listened, but nothing was substantial.
Teams felt they could steal him for nothing.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While no longer a member of Congress, as the
Republican presidential candidate in 1996 I do have more than a
passing interest in the pending impeachment proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Without rehashing that election, suffice it to say that any
chance of success I may have had was wiped out by an avalanche of
negative television advertising paid for with money raised through
questionable fund-raising tactics by the president and vice
president. Attorney General Janet Reno has buried her head in the
sand on this serious matter, but let's hope that someone in
Congress will hold the attorney general accountable and pursue the
alleged illegal fund-raising activities.
</P>
<P>
   Having said that, let me lay out what might be an imperfect but
tough and reasonable solution to the pending impeachment matter.
</P>
<P>
   I have reminded myself that to impeach or accuse is the
constitutional responsibility of the House; to convict or acquit is
the constitutional responsibility of the Senate. I seriously doubt
that half the American people understand the complex impeachment
process.
</P>
<P>
   Let me also note, at the outset, that many large and small
details would have to be worked out by congressional leaders
working with the House and Senate parliamentarians and legal
counsels. I've been there and know how much work putting all this
together will entail, including all the procedural hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   So, here goes:
</P>
<P>
   Step No. 1: Vote in the House of Representatives on any or all
of the four articles of impeachment reported by the House Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Step No. 2: Regardless of the outcome of the House vote on any
of the four articles, the Senate majority leader would, at the
earliest possible time, introduce in the Senate a joint resolution
(numbered 1600 if possible). The resolution would contain the
essence or ``guts'' of all articles of impeachment considered by
the House, plus any other necessary language, as determined by the
Senate majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   Step No. 3: After suspending or amending the rules governing
impeachment proceedings, the Senate would take up and consider the
joint resolution under a time agreement. The vice president
(president of the Senate) would preside at all times. No amendments
except technical amendments offered by the majority leader would be
in order. All points of order would be waived.
</P>
<P>
   Step No. 4: Upon final action by the Senate, the House of
Representatives would take up the joint resolution: no amendments
in order, except technical amendments offered by the Speaker or his
designee. Points of order would be waived. The resolution would be
considered under a time agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Step No. 5: If a House-Senate conference is necessary, the
conference report would be considered under a time agreement in
both the House and the Senate. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Conditions, Etc. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. The president announces his intention to support and sign the
joint resolution before any action on the resolution by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   a. The president agrees to sign the joint resolution at a public
signing ceremony attended by the vice president, congressional
leadership and other appropriate members of the House and Senate
recommended by Democratic and Republican leaders; the president's
Cabinet; the chief justice of the Supreme Court, and others as
recommended by House and Senate leaders.
</P>
<P>
   b. White House, Senate and House media _ television, radio,
print and photographers _ shall be present.
</P>
<P>
   c. The site, date and hour of the ceremony is to be determined
by the House Speaker, or his designee, and the Senate majority
leader.
</P>
<P>
   d. Copies of the signed joint resolution, with an appropriate
presidential letter, are to be forwarded to members of the Cabinet,
members of Congress and heads of other government agencies. This is
to be completed within seven days of signing the joint resolution.
</P>
<P>
   2. The overall agreement is to be determined by the Speaker, or
his designee, and the Senate majority leader. Possible items:
</P>
<P>
   a. All congressional action completed and the president's
signature affixed on or by Jan. 2, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   b. Bipartisan. Any agreement in the House or Senate with
reference to the proceedings shall be inoperative if the president,
vice president and Democratic congressional leaders fail to
publicly and actively support the joint resolution. Support is to
be demonstrated by the president, vice president and Democratic
leadership in House and Senate, prior to and throughout
consideration of the joint resolution. Republican leaders also
agree to publicly and actively support it.
</P>
<P>
   c. The Speaker, or his designee, and the majority leader shall
outline procedure, rules, time and any and all other matters
pertaining to debate and disposition of the joint resolution, and
could, if appropriate, include provisions relating to the
president's legal obligations upon leaving office.
</P>
<P>
   3. Penalties. Any penalty imposed must be in accordance with the
Constitution and could require the voluntary agreement by the
President to overcome the prohibition against bills of attainder. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Summary &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These are my ideas. They are offered in good faith. I have
consulted with no one.
</P>
<P>
   They may not be worthy of a second thought, but I believe the
suggestions could lead to a fairly broad bipartisan result. There
is scarcely anyone who believes that the required 67 senators would
vote to convict the president on any of the four articles of
impeachment approved by the House Judiciary Committee,
notwithstanding what the full House might do.
</P>
<P>
   I hope these suggestions will be seen as a blending of
responsibility and justice, which will permit an expeditious
disposition of the entire matter before the new 106th Congress
begins work in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   It is also my hope that pursuing the above suggested outline, or
a modified version thereof, would demonstrate to the vast majority
of Americans that Republican congressional leaders will fulfill
their constitutional responsibilities, clear the decks and move
forward when the 106th Congress convenes on Jan. 6, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   I cannot imagine a better way for Republicans to start the new
year than by taking charge, and producing just results, at this
historic moment. It is time for a tough but responsible conclusion.
Maybe these ideas will be a starting point for a bipartisan ending.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While no longer a member of Congress, as the
Republican presidential candidate in 1996 I do have more than a
passing interest in the pending impeachment proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Without rehashing that election, suffice it to say that any
chance of success I may have had was wiped out by an avalanche of
negative television advertising paid for with money raised through
questionable fund-raising tactics by the president and vice
president. Attorney General Janet Reno has buried her head in the
sand on this serious matter, but let's hope that someone in
Congress will hold the attorney general accountable and pursue the
alleged illegal fund-raising activities.
</P>
<P>
   Having said that, let me lay out what might be an imperfect but
tough and reasonable solution to the pending impeachment matter.
</P>
<P>
   I have reminded myself that to impeach or accuse is the
constitutional responsibility of the House; to convict or acquit is
the constitutional responsibility of the Senate. I seriously doubt
that half the American people understand the complex impeachment
process.
</P>
<P>
   Let me also note, at the outset, that many large and small
details would have to be worked out by congressional leaders
working with the House and Senate parliamentarians and legal
counsels. I've been there and know how much work putting all this
together will entail, including all the procedural hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   So, here goes:
</P>
<P>
   Step No. 1: Vote in the House of Representatives on any or all
of the four articles of impeachment reported by the House Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Step No. 2: Regardless of the outcome of the House vote on any
of the four articles, the Senate majority leader would, at the
earliest possible time, introduce in the Senate a joint resolution
(numbered 1600 if possible). The resolution would contain the
essence or ``guts'' of all articles of impeachment considered by
the House, plus any other necessary language, as determined by the
Senate majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   Step No. 3: After suspending or amending the rules governing
impeachment proceedings, the Senate would take up and consider the
joint resolution under a time agreement. The vice president
(president of the Senate) would preside at all times. No amendments
except technical amendments offered by the majority leader would be
in order. All points of order would be waived.
</P>
<P>
   Step No. 4: Upon final action by the Senate, the House of
Representatives would take up the joint resolution: no amendments
in order, except technical amendments offered by the Speaker or his
designee. Points of order would be waived. The resolution would be
considered under a time agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Step No. 5: If a House-Senate conference is necessary, the
conference report would be considered under a time agreement in
both the House and the Senate. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Conditions, Etc. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. The president announces his intention to support and sign the
joint resolution before any action on the resolution by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   a. The president agrees to sign the joint resolution at a public
signing ceremony attended by the vice president, congressional
leadership and other appropriate members of the House and Senate
recommended by Democratic and Republican leaders; the president's
Cabinet; the chief justice of the Supreme Court, and others as
recommended by House and Senate leaders.
</P>
<P>
   b. White House, Senate and House media _ television, radio,
print and photographers _ shall be present.
</P>
<P>
   c. The site, date and hour of the ceremony is to be determined
by the House Speaker, or his designee, and the Senate majority
leader.
</P>
<P>
   d. Copies of the signed joint resolution, with an appropriate
presidential letter, are to be forwarded to members of the Cabinet,
members of Congress and heads of other government agencies. This is
to be completed within seven days of signing the joint resolution.
</P>
<P>
   2. The overall agreement is to be determined by the Speaker, or
his designee, and the Senate majority leader. Possible items:
</P>
<P>
   a. All congressional action completed and the president's
signature affixed on or by Jan. 2, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   b. Bipartisan. Any agreement in the House or Senate with
reference to the proceedings shall be inoperative if the president,
vice president and Democratic congressional leaders fail to
publicly and actively support the joint resolution. Support is to
be demonstrated by the president, vice president and Democratic
leadership in House and Senate, prior to and throughout
consideration of the joint resolution. Republican leaders also
agree to publicly and actively support it.
</P>
<P>
   c. The Speaker, or his designee, and the majority leader shall
outline procedure, rules, time and any and all other matters
pertaining to debate and disposition of the joint resolution, and
could, if appropriate, include provisions relating to the
president's legal obligations upon leaving office.
</P>
<P>
   3. Penalties. Any penalty imposed must be in accordance with the
Constitution and could require the voluntary agreement by the
President to overcome the prohibition against bills of attainder. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Summary &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These are my ideas. They are offered in good faith. I have
consulted with no one.
</P>
<P>
   They may not be worthy of a second thought, but I believe the
suggestions could lead to a fairly broad bipartisan result. There
is scarcely anyone who believes that the required 67 senators would
vote to convict the president on any of the four articles of
impeachment approved by the House Judiciary Committee,
notwithstanding what the full House might do.
</P>
<P>
   I hope these suggestions will be seen as a blending of
responsibility and justice, which will permit an expeditious
disposition of the entire matter before the new 106th Congress
begins work in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   It is also my hope that pursuing the above suggested outline, or
a modified version thereof, would demonstrate to the vast majority
of Americans that Republican congressional leaders will fulfill
their constitutional responsibilities, clear the decks and move
forward when the 106th Congress convenes on Jan. 6, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   I cannot imagine a better way for Republicans to start the new
year than by taking charge, and producing just results, at this
historic moment. It is time for a tough but responsible conclusion.
Maybe these ideas will be a starting point for a bipartisan ending.

BLEDSOE UNLIKELY TO TAKE FIELD AGAINST 49ERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Drew Bledsoe will be holding a clipboard,
not a football, when Steve Young, Jerry Rice, and the San Francisco
49ers come to Foxboro Stadium Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   At least that is the plan as of Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Plans have been known to change, but it appears that if the
Patriots are going to reach the playoffs, they need Bledsoe to be
healthier than he is now for the regular-season finale against the
Jets Dec. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots coach Pete Carroll would not name a starter for the
49ers game, hinting that both Scott Zolak and Tom Tupa could be in
the mix.
</P>
<P>
   According to a source familiar with Bledsoe's medical situation,
doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital recommended that Bledsoe,
who had a painful day in a 32-18 loss to the St. Louis Rams Sunday,
rest the finger this week and most of next week so he can be ready
for the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots feel that game will be more important to their
playoff fate than the 49ers game.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterback had the finger reevaluated Monday by specialist
Dr. James Herndon and team physician Bert Zarins. Bledsoe had
another X-ray which, according to the source, revealed that Bledsoe
had not suffered any more damage to the finger, but the pins that
doctors had placed in the finger to stabilize one of the two breaks
were surgically restabilized.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe also suffered some bleeding as a result of the pins
moving around and popping out the other side through his skin.
</P>
<P>
   The prolonged rest is expected to allow more healing of the
cracked bone, and the doctors feel the pins won't have the tendency
to dislodge when more healing has taken place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our thinking that we have to give him this week off,''
Carroll said at Monday's press conference. ``He's been doing about
all he can. We're thinking right now that we have to give him a
break this week. He's not able to perform the way he's capable of
playing under the current conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if he didn't have a broken finger and he doesn't
practice, it definitely takes away from the preparation for the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   In a release Monday detailing the treatment Bledsoe received,
the Patriots would only say that Bledsoe's playing status for
Sunday is ``uncertain'' and that his condition would be updated
later in the week.
</P>
<P>
   The coach, who called Bledsoe a ``warrior,'' said Bledsoe's
problems began after his warmups, during which it appeared he was
throwing with accuracy and velocity.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the warmups it started to change,'' said Carroll. ``The
intricacies of this go beyond what we can understand right now. He
came upon some problems. It was was like sending the fighter to the
corner and sending out the cut man for a while, but now it's
progressed too far. Drew is the kind of guy who will go out there
at all costs. We've made it clear to him that he needs to rest.''
</P>
<P>
   While it appears Zolak is the likely replacement, Carroll left
the door open for Tupa, or perhaps both.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two guys will take care of the QB position,'' insisted
Carroll. ``We're going to take more time to make the decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Zolak played in parts of two series against the Rams, but
fumbled when Ray Agnew sacked him and St. Louis recovered at the
Patriots' 13. ``It was a tough play, but even if I had three guys
hitting me, I shouldn't have fumbled the ball,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zolak has been preparing as the starter the past three weeks in
practice. ``It's up to Pete,'' Zolak added. ``He makes all the
decisions. I've been practicing like I'm going to play. It's tough
_ it's like a seesaw thing. I thought I'd play in the Buffalo game,
but Drew made it back, which was good for him. It's a little
draining but it's my job. I'm the backup.''
</P>
<P>
   Tupa said he took just as many snaps as Zolak last week.
</P>
<P>
   Tupa has more experience in terms of games started, 13-5. Zolak
has completed 54.4 percent of his passes to Tupa's 51.3. Tupa last
started a game in 1991 with the Cardinals, while Zolak hasn't
started since November 1995 against the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   Both Zolak and Tupa have incentive to perform _ both are
unrestricted free agents at the end of the season. Tupa obviously
has value as a punter, but he would have a chance to show that he's
still a player the Patriots or another team can consider a
quarterback and thus save roster space. The Browns and the Jets
will be two teams eyeing Tupa if the Patriots don't re-sign him.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll likes Tupa's throwing ability, which is why he always
mentions him in the mix. One downside to starting Tupa is the
possibility he could get hurt and thus be lost as a punter. Adam
Vinatieri is the team's backup punter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been in a sitaution like this where two
quarterbacks could play in the same game,'' said Tupa. ``If Drew
can't go, they might have a game plan that might benefit me. I
guess we'll know more (Wednesday).''
</P>
<P>
   Tupa is involved in all of the quarterback meetings with Bledsoe
and Zolak, so he knows the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't rule anything out at this point,'' said Carroll. ``We
could use both guys, but we'll make a clear-cut decision on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Zolak was somewhat skeptical about using two quarterbacks in a
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Pete's decision,'' he said. ``You have to get a rhythm
and get going. It's tough for me and the guys around me.''
</P>
<P>
   How will either Zolak and Tupa win the trust and confidence of
their teammates in such a crucial game?
</P>
<P>
   ``They see me in practice and they see what I can do,'' said
Zolak. ``These guys have busted their tails all year in practice
and in games. I have to show them that I can move the offense down
the field and move the markers. I have to show them I can get the
ball in the end zone, for no matter how you do it, you have to do
it.''

HUGHES TO BUY SATELLITE TV COMPETITOR
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Minn.)   (jw) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hughes Electronics Corp. agreed Monday to pay
about $1.3 billion in cash and stock to buy U.S. Satellite
Broadcasting Co., a move aimed at fortifying Hughes' DirecTV unit
as the nation's leading provider of television programs transmitted
directly to homes by satellite.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition comes two weeks after the Echostar
Communications Corp. agreed to buy satellite television assets from
the News Corp. and MCI Worldcom, giving it more channel capacity
than DirecTV. Together, the deals reduce the number of satellite
television companies in the United States to three from five,
although the News Corp.-MCI partnership had never actually provided
service. All the companies are in a high-stakes battle to sign up
enough subscribers to become profitable.
</P>
<P>
   DirecTV has nearly 4.3 million subscribers and Echostar has 1.8
million, and each added about 100,000 in November. The third
remaining company, Primestar Partners, which is owned by several
cable television companies, has about 2.3 million subscribers and
grew in November at half the rate of the two others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's starting to look like a two-horse race between DirecTV
and Echostar,'' said Tom Watts, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, who
said Primestar was less competitive because it required a larger
antenna.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, each U.S. Satellite share can be exchanged
for either 0.3775 share of General Motors class H stock or the
equivalent in cash. The exchange ratio is fixed as long as GM class
H stock trades between $27.82 and $47.68 in the days before the
deal closes. Hughes Electronics, based in El Segundo, Calif., is
owned by GM but has stock that reflects its own financial results.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Hughes' closing price of $38.25 on Friday, the offer is
valued at $14.44 a share, 50 percent above U.S. Satellite's closing
price of $9.625 that day and about double its price before rumors
of the deal began spreading on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   GM's class H shares fell $1.5625 Monday, to $36.6875. U.S.
Satellite rose $2.8125, to $12.4375.
</P>
<P>
   DirecTV and U.S. Satellite already operate with common
satellites and common viewer-receiving equipment. But viewers must
order the services separately and pay two monthly bills if they
take both. Executives said merging would eliminate customer
confusion and spur sales. ``We had to make the up-front sales
simpler,'' Stanley Hubbard, U.S. Satellite president, said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Existing consumers of either or both services would not have to
change their equipment but would receive a single bill. DirecTV
officials said they did not plan immediately to change prices but
might offer new packages of programs.
</P>
<P>
   Eddy Hartenstein, DirecTV president, said the deal would save
$160 million to $180 million a year, though he declined to say how
many people would lose jobs. DirecTV would increase the number of
channels it offers to more than 210 from 185 and could fill a big
hole in its lineup by offering Home Box Office and Showtime movie
channels, which U.S. Satellite now carries.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   DirecTV would not gain many new subscribers because all but
200,000 of its competitor's 2 million subscribers are already
DirecTV customers, as well. But executives said DirecTV revenue
would immediately increase by $800 million to $900 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   DirecTV forecasts revenue of $1.5 billion and an operating loss
of $100 million this year. It expects to break even on a cash-flow
basis around the second quarter of 1999, though a profit is not
expected until 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition requires approval of U.S. Satellite shareholders
and the FCC and antitrust regulators. More than 51 percent of U.S.
Satellite shares are held by Hubbard Broadcasting of St. Paul,
Minn., which owns television and radio stations. Hughes officials
said that they expected no regulatory problems and that the deal
would close in mid-1999.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the FCC barred DirecTV from participating in an
auction for an orbital position for a satellite, fearing that it
would control too many.

TRADE TALKS LEAVE RED SOX POWERLESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE _ There are still 10 shopping days until Christmas,
two months until the start of spring training, and almost four
months until Pedro Martinez takes the mound in Kansas City on April
5 and throws the first pitch of the 1999 season for the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Time, in other words, for General Manager Dan Duquette to
accomplish what he was unable to do in three days of trade talks
here: Find a power hitter and some significant pitching help.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette acknowledged Monday night that he'll more than likely
leave empty-handed Tuesday from baseball's winter meetings, which
have been distinguished by one mega-signing (Kevin Brown's $105
million deal with the Dodgers) and little else.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether the groundwork undertaken by
Duquette and his lieutenants here eventually will bear fruit,
though some intriguing acquisitions were discussed. Here they are,
though hardly in order of their likelihood of happening:
</P>
<P>
   --Frank Thomas. White Sox General Manager Ron Schueler said he
was approached by one club here about his remaining marquee player,
who ranks No. 1 among all active players in both on-base percentage
(.443) and slugging percentage (.584), despite having an off-season
by his exalted standards (.265 batting average, 29 home runs, 109
RBIs). That team was the Red Sox, Duquette confirmed Monday. And
while he said it is ``premature'' to envision the Big Hurt in a Red
Sox uniform, Thomas ranks as the one player who might be available
who could fill Mo Vaughn's considerable shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Schueler isn't shopping Thomas, but at least he expressed a
willingness to listen. And the Red Sox are a team that would not be
scared off by the approximately $78 million that Thomas' contract
guarantees for the next eight years. Thomas, who will be 31 on May
27, might even be considered a bargain by today's standards, and
would immediately return the Sox to contender status. Expect some
followup conversation.
</P>
<P>
   --Ryan Klesko. The 27-year-old first baseman-outfielder was a
prime topic of conversation between the Red Sox and Braves. Klesko,
is owed $17 million over the next three years and is coming off an
off-season in which his production dropped to 18 home runs and 70
RBIs, though he can point to an in-season appendectomy as a
contributing factor to his decline. The Braves, who signed
free-agent Brian Jordan, have a surplus of outfielders but are in
no hurry to part with Klesko. They're looking for a middle
reliever/setup man (Derek Lowe) in return, plus a top prospect from
the Sox. According to two National League sources, they've asked
about shortstop Adam Everett, Boston's No. 1 pick last June, as
well as shortstop Julio Guerrero, brother of Expos' star Vladimir
Guerrero.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox are prohibited by baseball rules from trading a draft
pick until one year after he was drafted, so Everett couldn't be
included in a deal until June. Expect the Sox to try and entice the
Braves with other prospects. This deal has a chance.
</P>
<P>
   --Russ Davis. The Sox envision converting Davis, a leaden-handed
third baseman for the Mariners last season (32 errors) into a first
baseman. Davis played first base in the Yankees' system, and after
hitting 20 home runs in each of the last two seasons, the Sox think
it's not out of the question for the right-handed hitting Davis,
29, to blossom into a 30-homer man in Fenway Park. The Mariners may
also be asking for Lowe.
</P>
<P>
   --Gregg Jefferies. He's still available as a free agent, but
Duquette said Monday that ``he's not very high on our list. We're
looking for a little more power.'' The switch-hitting Jefferies hit
nine home runs last season.
</P>
<P>
   --John Jaha. Another free agent, Jaha has played 100 games in a
season only once in the last five seasons because of injuries. The
Red Sox have looked at his medical records and Duquette said Monday
they're bringing him to Boston for further medical evaluation, but
the 33-year-old former Brewer ranks no better than a fallback plan
if nothing else materializes.
</P>
<P>
   --Kevin Appier. Another high-risk possibility after undergoing
shoulder surgery in March and missing most of last season, the Sox
nonetheless talked to the Royals about the 31-year-old righthander,
who has $4.8 million remaining on his contract for next season. If
Duquette waits to see if Appier is healthy in spring training,
he'll risk competition from other suitors. And while that would
seem to be the prudent thing to do, Duquette has been known to take
that risk before.
</P>
<P>
   --Tim Belcher. The 37-year-old righthander has at least one
three-year offer from a club, agent Scott Boras said. Duquette said
the team has not made a formal offer, and would not be willing to
go more than two years on a deal. Doesn't look like a match.
</P>
<P>
   --Dan Miceli. The Padres' setup man, who has appeared in 138
games the last two seasons, would be a welcome addition to a
bullpen thin behind Tom Gordon, Jim Corsi and Lowe. The Padres are
said to want a top prospect in return, one close to big-league
readiness. The Red Sox may not be a match.
</P>
<P>
   --Roger Clemens. For the last time, the Rocket won't be coming
back. Duquette admitted as much Monday night, in the wake of
Clemens' demands for Kevin Brown-type money in any deal to which he
agrees. ``That's a little rich for us,'' Duquette said. Which
doesn't even address the fact that the Sox would have little to
entice the Blue Jays to make that deal.

FASSEL SAVORS THE UNLIKELIEST OF VICTORIES  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Jim Fassel found it easy to smile Monday
morning at Giants Stadium. He was at his office at 6 a.m., making
coffee and musing on the surprising succession of events that had
led to Sunday's 20-16 shocker over the Denver Broncos when the
assistant coach Rod Dowhower appeared in the doorway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim,'' Dowhower said. ``Before you look at the regular Kansas
City tape, take a look at these other two.''
</P>
<P>
   Dowhower handed Fassel videotapes of the Kansas City Chiefs, the
Giants' opponent on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Geez, Rod, I haven't even had my coffee yet,'' Fassel said.
</P>
<P>
   Even the driven, dutiful Fassel was anxious to take a few
moments to enjoy the biggest National Football League
regular-season upset in several years. Monday, for the first time
in several weeks, Fassel looked comfortable in the wake of a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team deserves to feel the way it feels,'' he said. ``The
team played hard and with confidence and never once sensed there
was any reason to lose hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel's primary recollection of the Broncos game was how smart
and aware his team played. Receiving more praise than any other
player was Kent Graham. For the first time, Fassel conceded Monday
that Graham might compete for the starting quarterback's job next
season with Danny Kanell, and that Graham could be the team's
quarterback of the future.
</P>
<P>
   That has never before been acknowledged by any Giants official.
Fassel also said Graham would probably start the team's final two
games. ``I'd say that's a really safe assumption,'' Fassel said.
</P>
<P>
   It's amazing what an upset victory over a previously unbeaten
team will do. Last Monday, Fassel indicated that he was going to
have Kanell ready to replace Graham at a moment's notice _ that
Graham's audition at quarterback could be over as soon as he was no
longer leading the Giants to victory.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when asked if Graham was a part of next year's quarterback
picture, Fassel said: ``Oh, yeah, sure. I've always believed that
if you see a guy do it one time, you can get him to do it again.
This game shows he's capable of playing this way. From our
standpoint, in a lot of ways, he was the difference in yesterday's
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Graham's play, Fassel seemed to be marveling at the
wherewithal of his 6-8 team against the Broncos. It was, after all,
just four weeks ago that the Giants had lost three straight games
and five of their last six.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Fassel Monday recalled in detail how guard Ron
Stone hopped 45 yards across the field on one leg in the game's
final 80 seconds to save time and help keep a Giants drive alive.
</P>
<P>
   Stone had a bruised calf, and since the Giants were out of
timeouts, the game officials would have taken 10 seconds off the
clock if he needed assistance to leave the field.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the Giants didn't need those 10 seconds. Three
plays later, with 48 seconds left, Graham hit Amani Toomer with the
game-winning touchdown pass.
</P>
<P>
   But at the time, with 1 minute 12 seconds to play, those seconds
seemed precious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stone knew he had to get off the field,'' Fassel, who gave the
players Monday off, said. ``The guys on the bench knew they
couldn't help him. Jerry Reynolds ran in to replace him, and Kent
turned and had Stone in the corner of his eye, waiting for Stone to
get off the field before he snapped the football.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of that is very impressive, for a bunch of guys to have
that presence of mind in a big situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's game showed the Giants off at their best this season,
and it inevitably made Fassel think back to games lost _ at
Washington and at Oakland _ that the Giants were expected to win.
</P>
<P>
   Had the Giants won even one of those games, they would be tied
with the 7-7 Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Arizona Cardinals for the
final National Football Conference wild-card berth.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they are one game behind in that race, with few of the
tie breakers in their favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always look back and say, `Gosh, if we had just won this
one game,''' Fassel said. ``The way we're playing now magnifies the
losses in some games. But you can kill yourself if you go back too
much. In every season, win or lose, you can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, this morning, Fassel seemed anxious to momentarily
postpone the usual pattern of his coaching life, with its
one-game-at-a-time, on-with-the-next-game existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a coach's mentality,'' he said. ``But still, this was a
really special win.''

SPORTS COLUMN: GIANTS SHOW JETS SUPER IS POSSIBLE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, the day after the rookie wide receiver Randy
Moss of the Minnesota Vikings had riddled the Cowboys with three
touchdown receptions on Thanksgiving, Bill Parcells was holding his
daily news briefing in Jetsworld when an impertinent question was
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you thought,'' somebody said, ``about how you're going to
stop Randy Moss in the Super Bowl?''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' coach rolled his eyes, shook his head, glanced at the
ceiling and never answered.
</P>
<P>
   He understood the question for what it was then, an irrelevant
joke.
</P>
<P>
   It's not such an irrelevant joke now.
</P>
<P>
   With a 20-16 upset Sunday that should be remembered as one of
New York's most memorable pro football games, the Giants showed the
Denver Broncos to be fallible and thereby showed the Jets, now 10-4
after their 21-16 success in Miami, the way to Super Bowl XXXIII
where Randy Moss and the Vikings might be waiting.
</P>
<P>
   But the Jets' road to Miami on Jan. 31 has several tollbooths _
beginning in Buffalo on Saturday and eventually in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The toll collector in Buffalo will be Doug Flutie, who surely
doesn't want to be embarrassed as he was five weeks ago in the
Jets' 34-12 rout. Until then, Flutie had generated 14 touchdowns,
but that day he put only four field goals on the scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been five years since I got my tail kicked like this,''
Flutie said then, alluding to a Canadian Football League game.
``Their four linebackers and four defensive backs gave me
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Be assured that Flutie will be using a different game plan.
Should the Bills win, they would tie the Jets for first place in
the American Football Conference East; the Bills finish in New
Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Jets roll through Buffalo, they will clinch first
place in the AFC East. And if the Jacksonville Jaguars, shaky since
quarterback Mark Brunell suffered a severely sprained ankle, lose
in Minnesota on Sunday night, the Jets will have earned a bye
through the Jan. 2-3 wild-card weekend of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Jets and Jaguars both win, another Jet victory in
their season finale at Giants Stadium against New England would
assure the bye.
</P>
<P>
   When Parcells twice won the Super Bowl with the Giants, after
the 1986 and 1990 seasons, and when he took the Patriots to the
Super Bowl two years ago, he had the benefit of the bye each time.
It not only provides players a bonus week of rest, but it is one
fewer game to win, one fewer game when anything can happen, one
fewer game when an important player can get hurt.
</P>
<P>
   With a bye, all the Jets would need to do is win their division
playoff, perhaps against Jacksonville, and they would be in the AFC
championship game _ probably in Denver, now in mourning ever since
the acrobatic wide receiver Amani Toomer caught Kent Graham's
37-yard touchdown pass to make the Giants' season.
</P>
<P>
   That touchdown also made the 1972 Dolphins' season. As the only
undefeated and untied team in National Football League history,
those Super Bowl VII champions with Larry Csonka and Nick
Buoniconti were 17-0. The Broncos, with a chance to go 19-0 if they
repeated in the Super Bowl, were threatening to upstage them.
</P>
<P>
   For all the hype of their 13-0 record, the Broncos had been
vulnerable in their two previous victories, over the San Diego
Chargers and the Kansas City Chiefs. Now, with their hopes for 19-0
shattered, the Broncos must regroup for next Monday night's visit
to Miami, where the Dolphins desperately need to win if they are to
salvage a wild-card spot.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the Broncos are no longer a lock to represent the AFC
in the Super Bowl, especially if Parcells and the Jets arrive at
the Denver tollbooth. The 1990 49ers and Bills will attest to that.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells, along with Bill Belichick and his other Giants
coaches, prevented those 49ers (with Joe Montana and Jerry Rice)
from having an opportunity to win three consecutive Super Bowls
with a 15-13 victory in the National Conference title game in San
Francisco. Then Parcells' ball-control game plan kept the ball away
from Jim Kelly and the Bills in Super Bowl XXV, 20-19.
</P>
<P>
   And if the Jets get through all those tollbooths on the road to
the Super Bowl, Bill Parcells might need to figure out how to stop
Randy Moss.

NHL GETS IT RIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The three-game suspension handed down Monday by the NHL to Kings
defenseman Rob Blake was a harsh decision, overly punitive _ and a
very good sign for those tired of the savagery that eternally has
dragged down the sport of hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Blake, by no means a dirty player, insists he wasn't trying to
deliver a cheap shot Saturday night when his two-handed chop landed
on the elbow of Vancouver's Harry York. Instead, Blake insists he
simply aimed badly in trying to connect with York's stick in an
effort to create an outnumbered attack for the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   There is no reason not to believe Blake. The last thing he would
have wanted with a third-period, two-goal lead and a man already in
the penalty box was to give the Canucks a two-man advantage, which
is exactly what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Logic dictates that Blake's play was accidental, and relatively
harmless accidents (York was not seriously injured) should not be
met with three-game suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the NHL's image has historically been tarnished by
barbarism on the ice. It appears the cleansing period the sport has
long needed is upon us.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, when Brian Burke was the NHL's director of
discipline, he suspended 15 players for a total of 45 games. That
included the ludicrously brief four-game suspension assessed to
then-Chicago defenseman Gary Suter for a vicious cross check to the
chin that almost ruined the career of Mighty Ducks star Paul
Kariya.
</P>
<P>
   This season, former New York Rangers coach Colin Campbell has
replaced Burke, who is now the Canucks' general manager. In about
one-third of a season, Campbell has issued 16 suspensions totaling
57 games for infractions ranging from stick fouls to slew-footing
to Chicago's Reid Simpson hurling a water bottle at a fan (two
games).
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to gripe about individual miscarriages of justice,
such as the discipline to Blake. But a period of harsh judgments
can only help to clean up hockey and promote the elements of speed
and skill that should be the NHL's most attractive assets.
</P>
<P>
   __ Coffey break: Former Kings defenseman Paul Coffey, who has
appeared in just four games this season for the Chicago Blackhawks,
recently visited the Mayo Clinic to find out what was wrong with
his back. It turned out that Coffey, 37, suffered nerve damage when
he received an injection to numb the pain of his original back
injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hit a nerve,'' Coffey said. ``I'm bitter it happened, but
I don't have any axes to grind. I just wish I had known sooner
because then I wouldn't have been tormenting myself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept pulling my hamstrings and hip flexors in those games,
because I was overcompensating. The (Mayo Clinic) doctors told me
it will be another month before the nerve is totally healed. But
once I get the strength built up in my quads and hamstrings, I can
skate again, maybe in another two or three days.''
</P>
<P>
   __ IHL memories: With goalie Felix Potvin in limbo as he awaits
a trade, Toronto recalled Glenn Healy from the IHL's Chicago
Wolves. The Leafs were paying Healy $1.2 million to play in the
minors while they tried to resolve Potvin's situation.
</P>
<P>
   Of his stay in Chicago, Healy said, ``We had a seven-hour bus
trip to Cincinnati. It was the longest airport runway of my life.
You couldn't get NHL scores on the out-of-town board, just the
Federal League (of ``Slap Shot'' fame).
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day on our way to the rink, we would pass this wild
store that sold liquor, cigarettes, tobacco chew and handguns. We
wondered how our coach (ex-Leaf John Anderson) would feel about us
sitting in the car, drinking and smoking and shooting off our guns
on our way to work.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Desert pucks: The Phoenix Coyotes could play host to an
upcoming All-Star Game. All Arizona taxpayers have to do is vote
for a new arena in Scottsdale to replace the sparkling America West
Arena, which is 6 years old.
</P>
<P>
   About a quarter of the seats in the America West Arena have
obstructed views, something the Coyotes' owners were fully aware of
a few years ago when they abandoned loyal fans in Winnipeg.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Coyotes have emerged as a Stanley Cup contender,
what better time to try to reach into the public till to build a
new facility?
</P>
<P>
   __ Loose pucks: Dallas' Joe Nieuwendyk had an exceptional
accomplishment last week in a 3-3 tie with San Jose, winning 20 of
21 faceoffs. ``I think we all take a lot of pride in that part of
the game,'' he said. ``We know how important it is.'' . . . Guy
Carbonneau, Dave Reid and Brian Skrudland have formed a line for
the Stars lately, a group with an average age of 35.7. A Dallas
writer dubbed it the ``Older Than Dirt'' line. . . Edmonton's
Andrei Kovalenko bought 20 Nashville Predators jerseys to outfit a
youth team in the Ukraine. ``I thought they might like something
new, not (Oilers jerseys),'' he said. . . The IHL has named its
Comeback Player of the Year Award after John Cullen, who missed all
of last season with cancer. Cullen retired after a brief comeback
this season with the Tampa Bay Lightning and in the IHL. ``When
(the IHL) phoned me and mentioned it, it caught me off-guard,''
said Cullen, now a Lightning assistant coach. ``When I hung up the
phone and started to think about it, I couldn't believe what an
honor it was. It makes me see and realize just how far I've come
back from the disease. That trophy is going to be around for a long
time and it's a huge honor.''

CANADA REJECTS MERGERS OF MAJOR BANKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The Finance Ministry rejected two mergers Monday that
would have left just three big banks in Canada. But the door was
kept open for other mergers once regulations have been overhauled.
</P>
<P>
   Finance Minister Paul Martin said he rejected the proposed deals
because they ``would lead to an unacceptable concentration of
economic power in the hands of fewer, very large banks.'' He
expressed concern about branch closings, job losses and a
tightening of credit for small businesses if the mergers took
place. And he released a report by the Federal Competition Bureau
that said the merged banks would have too much control over the
credit card and retail brokerage businesses.
</P>
<P>
   At least two of the banks involved in the deals indicated that
they could have addressed the issues raised by the competition
bureau. But Martin made it clear that he preferred to have the new
regulatory framework in place first.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's banking industry is already among the most highly
concentrated in the world. The proposed mergers would have created
two huge banks controlling 70 percent of assets.
</P>
<P>
   Martin did not rule out mergers among Canada's big banks but put
them off for at least a year while rules for the industry are
overhauled and a new merger review process is put in place.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, he said, ``the new proposals will first have to
demonstrate, in the light of the circumstances of the day, that
they do not unduly concentrate economic power, significantly reduce
competition or restrict our ability to address prudential
concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's cold shoulder comes almost a year after Canada's
financial services industry was shocked by the announcement that
the Royal Bank of Canada, the country's largest bank, planned to
merge with the Bank of Montreal, the third largest.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Martin was clearly displeased at not receiving
advance notice of the plans. Things got no better in April when the
second-ranked Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce announced a merger
with the Toronto-Dominion Bank, the fifth largest of Canada's top
five.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Godsoe, chairman of Scotiabank, the only large institution
not involved in a merger, eventually became an outspoken opponent
of the deals.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Martin began a news conference in Ottawa Monday
morning to announce his decision, it was well known that his answer
would be no. Shares of all four banks involved in the mergers
declined, the biggest drop by the Bank of Montreal, which fell
$1.55, to $62.05 (Canadian).
</P>
<P>
   Some industry analysts who supported the mergers are worried
that Canada's banks will be hurt by the decision. ``The banking
system in Canada is not going to have the scale and efficiency it
needs to fend off attacks from south of the border,'' said James
Andrew of Renaissance Worldwide, a strategic consulting firm in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts thought the mergers were not necessary for the
Canadian banks to remain competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``With or without the mergers, they can be survivors in the
North American arena,'' said Jamie Keating of Merrill Lynch Canada.
``They just had visions of being better, longer and more profitable
survivors.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed consolidations were never popular in Canada.
Opposition was especially strong in suburban and rural areas that
were almost certain to lose branches.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Martin's decision was announced, the Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce and Toronto-Dominion officially
terminated their merger plan. The move was no surprise because
Toronto-Dominion had released a statement more than a week ago
indicating that the deal was as good as dead.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Bank and the Bank of Montreal issued a joint statement
indicating that they would make a decision about their merger after
reviewing the government's decision, although they are not expected
to press on with the plan.

   The plan will equip all 2,247 officers with the $79.95 lock _ a
black device that can be unlocked within seconds, even in pitch
darkness, but is impenetrable to children, the manufacturer said.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement is expected to further rattle gunmakers, who
earlier this month learned they will be the target of a massive
Boston liability lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the major defenses that the industry put forward was
that it was going to take years to make guns more
child-resistant,'' said Dennis Henigan, legal director of the
Washington-based Center to Prevent Handgun Violence. ``Here you
have a police force doing just that. It certainly puts the industry
on the defensive.''
</P>
<P>
   The lock, produced by SafTLok, a company based in Tequesta,
Fla., was greeted with accolades from law enforcement officials
when it was introduced on the market earlier this year, according
to company president Frank Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 police departments, including Boston's, have been
testing the device for months, Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   After attaching the black device to either a Glock semiautomatic
pistol or a revolver, officers unlock the devices by pushing metal
buttons under the fingers of their firing hand. The combination
does not require sighting: like a Morse code, it unlocks after
receiving the proper number of clicks, a 2-3-2 pattern, perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't require the brain to really think,'' Brooks said.
``You can dial it quickly, while you're talking.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, police will be required to learn operation of the
safety device during regular gun training, according to Sergeant
Margot Hill, a Boston police spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   And although the device is easy to disarm, gun safety analysts
said police would be unlikely to keep their guns locked during work
hours.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal is in the off-hours; rather than just keeping
sidearms on the top shelf, officers will now have a surefire way to
keep the weapons from harming children, according to John
Rosenthal, founder of Stop Handgun Violence, the
Massachusetts-based advocacy group that bought the first 100 test
devices for Boston police.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the intent of the city of Boston and the police
department is to lead by example,'' Rosenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   Other municipalities have bought the device in smaller
quantities, and SafTLok has donated 2,300 to its local sheriff's
department in West Palm Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   In Orland Park, Ill., Police Chief Tim J. McCarthy _ a former
White House bodyguard who was gunned down alongside Ronald Reagan
during the 1981 assassination attempt _ equipped the 100 officers
on his police department with the device earlier this year,
immediately after it was put on the market. McCarthy said he spent
$5,000 of his equipment budget to ``provide the best method to keep
guns safe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt that, particularly in this day and age, we should
provide an opportunity for the officers to safeguard their
weapons,'' said McCarthy. ``This lock provides a different way to
unlock it. I don't think a child or an intruder would even have any
idea it was there.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun industry analysts see the SafTLok initiative _ coupled with
Mayor Menino's announced intention to sue the gun industry with 30
other cities nationwide _ as signaling an increasing attack on
gunmakers. In the past, gunmakers, who are unregulated by consumer
safety guidelines, have reluctantly acknowledged the possibility of
designing personalized guns and advanced safety devices, but called
them too expensive and still largely theoretical.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Henigan said, it is obvious that we are ``not talking
about Star Trek futuristic technology here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are talking about a system that is no more complicated than
your average locking briefcase,'' he said. ``That it can be
feasibly used for handguns is now being demonstrated by the Boston
Police Department.''

A DOUBLE PLAY FOR WILLIAMS AND CLEMENS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ The Texas Rangers worked to acquire the
Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams Monday, but this is a
sidelight to the Rangers' pursuit of pitcher Roger Clemens at the
winter meetings here. The Rangers appear to be the front-runners to
acquire Clemens from Toronto, though the Blue Jays and Clemens'
agents say that many teams are interested _ perhaps to solicit
greater interest from the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are expected to have the rights to Williams at the
conclusion of a series of maneuvers that commenced with the Rule 5
draft Monday. Williams, a running back at the University of Texas
awarded the Heisman Trophy two days ago, played the outfield for
the Philadelphia Phillies' Class A affiliate last summer. Because
Williams has split his time between baseball and football, his
skills are unrefined.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies did not protect him on their 40-man roster, and so
the Montreal Expos picked Williams; once Texas clears a spot on its
40-man roster, a baseball official indicated the Rangers are
willing to pay Montreal $100,000 for the rights to Williams, though
the Cincinnati Reds have offered to trade a player to the Expos.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens would also be a natural for the Rangers, who had
extensive meetings Sunday and Monday with Toronto officials, as
well as Clemens' agents, Randy and Alan Hendricks.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays had hoped for a vigorous market for Clemens, but
the pitcher's requirements in salary and location appear to have
hampered their trade leverage. The Houston Astros angrily pulled
out of the Clemens trade talks Sunday, indicating that the
Hendrickses had asked for a one-year, $27.4 million extension,
beyond the two years and $16.1 million that remain on Clemens'
current deal. The $14.5 million average annual salary of that
proposal would have been slightly less than the record $15 million
per year Kevin Brown will receive from the Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   But officials with other teams say that Clemens' agents are
asking for more than $15 million per year now; because Clemens is
from Houston, officials quote the Hendrickses as saying the Astros
would have received a ``hometown discount.'' The price of trading
players to Toronto and then meeting Clemens' demands has caused
Anaheim to drop out, and high-ranking officials from the Mets and
the Baltimore Orioles said Monday they would not want Clemens at
such a high cost.
</P>
<P>
   Other teams interested in Clemens are being told the Yankees are
seriously involved in talks, and Toronto officials have constantly
called Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman to solicit offers. The
presence of the Yankees in the bidding naturally would allow
Toronto to ask for more players and Clemens to ask for more money,
but Cashman's lukewarm interest apparently reflects that of the
Yankees' owner, George Steinbrenner. He met with the Hendrickses
Monday. ``If this is a seven-team race,'' said Cashman, ``we're
running seventh.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas and Toronto have traded proposals, with the Blue Jays
asking for outfielder Rusty Greer, the top prospect Ruben Mateo and
two others, and the Rangers countering with pitcher Rick Helling
and two prospects. The Rangers are attempting to acquire Milwaukee
second baseman Fernando Vina to include him in the package for
Clemens. Doug Melvin, the Texas general manager, said Monday night
he did not expect any resolution to the Clemens negotiations until
late this week. It figures that in the interim, the Hendrickses
will try to draw Steinbrenner into the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Only five trades have been completed here, and only two that
involved major leaguers. Cashman is seeking offers for third
baseman Mike Lowell, second baseman Homer Bush and outfielder Shane
Spencer, but does not seem close to making a trade.
</P>
<P>
   The Oakland Athletics offered pitcher Blake Stein and a minor
leaguer for Spencer, according to baseball officials, but the
Yankees rejected that proposal. The Padres offered minor leaguers
for Lowell _ as the Florida Marlins did last week _ but without
success; now San Diego hopes to acquire pitcher Kelvim Escobar from
Toronto and redirect him to the Yankees for Lowell.
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit Tigers signed catcher Bill Haselman to a two-year
contract, and the Kansas City Royals signed Chad Kreuter to a
one-year deal. The Minnesota Twins swapped e outfielder Alex Ochoa,
formerly of the Mets, to the Milwaukee Brewers for a player to be
named, and the Pittsburgh Pirates traded pitcher Jon Lieber to the
Chicago Cubs for outfielder Brant Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets lost pitcher Scott Sauerbeck in the major league
portion of the Rule 5 draft, and shortstop Ryan Jaroncyk in the
minor league portion. Jaroncyk, the Mets' No. 1 selection in the
1995 amateur draft, quit in May 1997, saying he didn't like
baseball.

   Bill Clinton is abortion. Bill Clinton is capital punishment.
Bill Clinton is opera, the designated hitter, affirmative action.
Bill Clinton is one of those subjects about which you made up your
mind a long time ago.
</P>
<P>
   And there's no changing it.
</P>
<P>
   You're convinced he's done enough to be impeached and removed
from office, or you're convinced he's not done enough to be
impeached and removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, you have all the information you need.
</P>
<P>
   More than you need.
</P>
<P>
   You've had it for months, and so have all the politicians in
Washington. They're no different from you, except for one small
thing.
</P>
<P>
   They lie about Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   All during the impeachment hearings in the House of
Representatives they pretended they hadn't reached a decision about
the president.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, most of them _ Democrats and Republicans _ decided
about Clinton years ago. Long before the special prosecutor issued
his final report.
</P>
<P>
   They're politicians, though, and don't have the guts of ordinary
citizens when it comes to speaking their minds.
</P>
<P>
   So, they decided to hold hearings to pass judgment on Clinton's
lies, all the while lying about their own opinions.
</P>
<P>
   And they're not done yet. &QL; 
The `undecided' &QL; 
Over the next few days, the ones who want Clinton impeached and the
ones who don't will be busy trying to twist the arms of the
``undecided.'' In a real trial, that would be called jury
tampering.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it matters.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, there are no ``undecided'' members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The ones who say they haven't made up their minds on impeachment
aren't doing so because they haven't reached a verdict on Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   How can they ``not'' have?
</P>
<P>
   They're either trying to put the squeeze on party leadership for
some pet project or legislation, or they're waiting to see which
vote, yes or no, will play best at home.
</P>
<P>
   The whole thing could be taken care of in about an hour. First,
the House votes to impeach and tosses the ball to the Senate. The
Senate holds a 30-minute ``trial,'' during which time they pretend
they haven't quite made up their minds. Then they vote.
</P>
<P>
   He goes. He stays.
</P>
<P>
   We move on.
</P>
<P>
   The reason you didn't watch live TV coverage of the House
impeachment hearings is because you knew all you needed to know. &QL; 
Nothing new &QL; 
You knew there'd be nothing new revealed, and there wasn't. Just as
there won't be anything new in a Senate trial, if and when it comes
to that.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton is anchovies.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton is a Neil Diamond song. Bill Clinton is instant
replay as an officiating tool in football. He's Seinfeld. He's
prayer in public schools. He's euthanasia.
</P>
<P>
   He's the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Rifle
Association.
</P>
<P>
   He's rap music.
</P>
<P>
   He's broccoli.
</P>
<P>
   He's karaoke.
</P>
<P>
   The national opinion polls haven't changed much over time. The
majority of people don't trust Clinton, or believe him, but still
don't want to go through an impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians may lie, but numbers don't.
</P>
<P>
   By now, nothing Clinton says or does could alter the way anyone
feels.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in his latest apology, Clinton said, ``I am
profoundly sorry for all I have done wrong in words and deeds. I
never should have misled the country, the Congress, my friends or
my family.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., one of the so-called ``undecided''
votes, said he was disappointed the president did not admit he
lied.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for this president to tell the truth,'' Tauzin said.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton had guts or a better sense of humor, he'd look
squarely in the eyes of Tauzin and every other congressman and
answer, ``I will if you will.'' &QL;

OUTLOOK APPEARS BLEAK FOR SALVAGING THE NBA SEASON  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They have tried small, secretive meetings in the
office of a law firm and large, scheduled gatherings in the
ballroom of a hotel. But Monday, as the 167th day of the lockout
passed, it appeared that nothing the players and owners do has done
much to salvage the National Basketball Association season.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after a negotiating session broke off after less than
30 minutes, neither the league nor the union was optimistic about a
rapid settlement to the contentious labor dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect there to be any talks this week,'' said Russ
Granik, the NBA deputy commissioner. ``We just don't know what to
talk about anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``The more frustrated you get, the more you want to
set a deadline to cancel the season. But we refuse to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The union was hoping to jump-start the talks and help end the
five-month dispute by offering concessions to the owners over the
weekend. But the league viewed the concessions as having little
impact toward helping the owners achieve some kind of cost
certainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're just marching in place,'' said Billy Hunter,
the union's executive director. ``We'll talk at some point, but as
of this moment, it's a game of wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   The players were scheduled to miss their third paychecks
Tuesday. With a month needed to restart the season, total salary
losses will top more than $400 million by mid-January. If another
week goes by before an agreement is signed, the league may be
forced to play less than a 50-game season _ a number several
observers feel is a benchmark for the owners weighing whether or
not to scrap the entire season.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the league held its annual Christmas party at the NBA
Store on Fifth Avenue. Commissioner David Stern attended. He also
confirmed that the league's staff had been trimmed to about 750
employees through attrition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have decreased our size by 125 full-time positions without
mandating layoffs,'' Stern said. The league instituted a hiring
freeze on July 1 and has not filled the vacancies.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the league would eventually lift the hiring freeze once
the lockout ended _ or begin layoffs if the season were canceled _
Stern added: ``I don't know. Our business is in the process of
changing right now.''

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
'Tis the season.
<TEXT>
<P>
   For most folks, anyway, as Christmas nears.
</P>
<P>
   But for locked-out basketball players, 'tis not the season _ the
NBA season.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of ``Ho, ho, ho,'' it's a case of, ``No, no, no.''
</P>
<P>
   No talks between the owners and the National Basketball Players
Association in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   No notion of when the season will begin _ or if there will even
be one.
</P>
<P>
   And no paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the union, today should have been the third payday
of the season. Instead, the players are in the same holding pattern
they've experienced since the lockout began 168 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you miss money you were expecting to get, it's
tough,'' said the Rockets' Brent Price. ``Obviously, for some guys
it's tougher than for others. If a guy hasn't played long in this
league, or if he's just starting out, then this is a tough time of
year. Right now, the focus should be on getting the season started
as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio's Avery Johnson agreed that the younger players in
the league are most affected by the prolonged lockout, since they
haven't had the opportunity to sock away money like the veterans
have learned to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this hurts different guys in different ways,'' Johnson
said of the missed paychecks. ``I think a lot of us, the veteran
players, were prepared for this, so we just keep on living and
don't miss a beat. But there are other situations where maybe guys
just weren't as prepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I wouldn't have been prepared in my first or second
year, no matter what I did, because I didn't handle my resources
properly. I didn't retain anything. I think the veteran players
should be in good shape. We're just worried about the young guys
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because there is no end in sight on this most
unpredictable labor front.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides thought they were closing in on a deal last week,
only to see a Saturday negotiating session fall apart in just 30
minutes. The session was supposed to be about finalizing details
that would contribute to a framework for an agreement, but conflict
again erupted, abruptly ending the meeting and dashing the players'
hopes again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that until they come out with a handshake agreement
and get it on paper, that's when a lot of us will believe it,''
Johnson said. ``Because when we saw they came so close, it was a
case of so-close-but-so-far, as I understand it. A lot of the stuff
that was reported (about a final deal being near) was true, but
unfortunately we change. We wake up with different ideas. We may go
to bed with one idea, but we can wake up with another. Seasons
change, and people change.''
</P>
<P>
   The sudden end to Saturday's session surprised many, especially
since most everyone entered the room believing a deal was in the
works. Instead, confusion over how to administer a complicated
escrow fund over the last three years of the deal got everyone
bogged down.
</P>
<P>
   The escrow deal, by which the players would kick in a percentage
of their salaries when spending goes beyond a determined limit, is
designed to slow the explosive salary growth that triggered the
lockout.
</P>
<P>
   The players would like to share the responsibility of
overspending with the owners and have offered 10 percent of their
salaries if the owners will cover any further overspending with a
tax. Now, the problem is arriving at an agreeable tax rate. Sources
say the owners would like a tax that would be around 600 percent,
meaning owners would have to pay $6 for every dollar they spend
above the predetermined limit.
</P>
<P>
   The players think such a rate is too prohibitive, saying it will
not only stifle salary growth (which is what the owners want) but
will also cause a competitive imbalance since only a few cash-flush
teams _ the Trail Blazers, Knicks and Lakers, for example _ would
be able to afford such a large tax.
</P>
<P>
   NBA commissioner David Stern has said the season will cancel
itself if a deal isn't reached in the not-too-distant future, a
threat the union believes to be a bluff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it does not look good,'' Stern said.

A JOLT FROM JOE: TODAY'S HEROES TAKE A FALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Where have you gone, Albert Belle?
</P>
<P>
   A nation turns its lonely eyes to you.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't think so. Somehow I doubt we'll ever hear Beck or Sheryl
Crow immortalize any of today's baseball players in a pop song the
way Paul Simon did Joe DiMaggio in ``Mrs. Robinson.''
</P>
<P>
   Why would they? What baseball player today _ what athlete in any
sport _ transcends his game so much that a succeeding generation
would bemoan his loss, and beckon to him for lost innocence and
hope?
</P>
<P>
   None, by my count. My generation has no one who comes close. And
we are poorer for it.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio's illness has writers sharpening their pencils and
their wits, ready to raise a toast in tribute to the great Yankee
Clipper, just in case. A great player, a great man, a giant who by
his very carriage moved beyond a mere game and became an icon of
popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   He married Marilyn Monroe. He appears, tangentially, in ``The
Old Man and the'' ``Sea,'' for heaven's sake.
</P>
<P>
   But to my generation, Joe DiMaggio isn't, sadly, Joltin' Joe.
He's Mr. Coffee. If that. Yes, those of us who love sports know
about the 56-game hitting streak, the sweet swing from the heels,
the Hall of Fame career that put him in the rarefied company of the
best of all time.
</P>
<P>
   We've glanced at the black-and-white clips, what there are of
them. We've heard our parents talk about him. But we didn't ``see''
him play, or hear crackly Yankees games broadcast on the radio.
He's a part of history, like FDR and Elvis _ important, yes, but a
part that we never experienced firsthand.
</P>
<P>
   There's no shame in that. We don't choose the time in which we
live. The shame is that so much has changed since DiMaggio's heyday
that we'll never see a hero like him again.
</P>
<P>
   Sports has changed. The closest thing to an athletic cultural
icon we have is Michael Jordan. He is immensely gifted,
preternaturally graceful, probably the best athlete in any team
sport of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that's all he is, an athlete. That and a businessman.
Increasingly we measure his status not by the number of
championships he's won (certainly not a consideration this year,
with the NBA so choked by greed the season is dangerously close to
being canceled) but by how big his last contract was.
</P>
<P>
   Will my children's children hold him in the same esteem people
hold DiMaggio today? Not a chance. A bigger contract will come
along for someone eventually.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not beatifying DiMaggio. I'm sure he has his foibles.
Nothing I've read about him made him sound like someone you'd
particularly want to have a beer with.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter. He wasn't running for Mr. Congeniality. He was
a baseball player. People liked their star athletes a little rough
around the edges. What the fans didn't know didn't hurt them.
</P>
<P>
   That's changed, too. What ``don't'' we know about Dennis Rodman?
Is there an aspect of the addictions of John Daly and Brett Favre
we haven't become intimately familiar with? If the media had delved
as deeply into Babe Ruth's personal life as they do Rodman's, pop
psychiatrists would still be analyzing him. We would name treatment
centers after him.
</P>
<P>
   We want to know every lurid detail about everyone, from
presidents to interns to movie stars to athletes, current and
retired. How else would we know how many times DiMaggio has had the
last rites administered?
</P>
<P>
   I know sports is just a diversion, not the place to go looking
for role models and heroes. Or so we're told, now that there are so
few who fit that bill to choose from.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe ``we'' have changed. Maybe we can't abide heroes anymore.
Why else would we tear them down the instant we've built them up?
With our thirst for intimate details has come a cheapening, a
cynicism _ a cynicism that says they're no better than we are,
right?
</P>
<P>
   Well, Joe DiMaggio ``is'' better, to hear my parents' generation
tell it. Heroes are supposed to be.
</P>
<P>
   I'm tired of cynicism. I'm ready for my generation's DiMaggio. I
just hope that if he's out there, if he has what it takes to be a
hero, we'll let him be one.
</P>
<P>
   So here's to heroes. Wherever we may find them. &QL;

BLAKE'S SUSPENSION STUNS KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Rob Blake will have to miss two more games
as a result of a slashing incident in Saturday's victory over
Vancouver, but the Los Angeles Kings' star defenseman, their coach
and their general manager don't think he should have been suspended
at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's too severe,'' general manager Dave Taylor said
Monday afternoon, shortly after NHL vice president Colin Campbell
handed down his verdict following a brief telephone hearing. ``Rob
slashed (Vancouver's Harry York). The referee (Don Koharski)
assigned him a major penalty, and I think that was appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake received a five-minute major and game misconduct for the
slash during the third period of a 3-0 victory Saturday. That night
Taylor said he didn't expect Blake to be suspended. But Sunday
morning, Campbell suspended Blake for that afternoon's game against
the Mighty Ducks, a 3-0 loss by the Kings. After Monday's hearing,
Campbell tacked two games on to the sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the five-minute major was definitely enough,'' said
Blake, who will lose $82,304.69 (three days) of his ($5.2675
million) salary in addition to a $1000 fine. ``(The Ducks game)
probably was one of the most important games of the year. The
damage is done.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Blake, he was swinging at York's stick on the play,
trying to knock the puck free to create a 2-on-1 for the Kings. But
York reached for the puck as Blake swung, and Blake missed his
stick and hit him on the arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I hit the guy's stick,'' Blake said, ``it's not even a
penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Explaining the severity of the suspension, Campbell said, ``Mr.
Blake used excessive force with a baseball-grip swing to the arm of
the Vancouver player. His use of the stick in this manner caused an
injury, which is something the league can't condone.''
</P>
<P>
   Kings coach Larry Robinson said, ``I don't think he deserved
(the first game of the suspension). They're trying to say it was a
baseball swing. If that's a baseball swing, he must be hitting
singles.''
</P>
<P>
   York left the game with a bruised arm, and X-rays were negative.
</P>
<P>
   Blake will miss Thursday's home game against the New York
Islanders and Saturday's visit to St. Louis, the 17th and 18th
games he's missed this season. He is eligible to return for
Sunday's game at Chicago. The Vancouver game was Blake's first
after a 15-game absence with a broken foot. The Kings (8-18-3) are
3-13 without Blake this season, 5-5-3 with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just puts us in the same position we've been in all
along,'' Robinson said. ``We've got to deal with reality. The
reality is we're not going to have him until Chicago.''

REPORT SAYS U.N. DIAMOND EMBARGO IS NOT WORKING 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUANDA, Angola _ The sale of diamonds is still underwriting the
war by Angolan rebels, and a U.N. embargo aimed at cutting off that
income is not working, a report said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The report, by a human rights organization in London, Global
Witness, says blame for the continued rebel traffic in Angolan
diamonds is widespread.
</P>
<P>
   De Beers, the South African company, and its Central Selling
Organization in London, the cartel that controls world prices of
uncut diamonds, lack the controls to make sure that the company is
not buying diamonds from rebel-held territories, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore the United Nations has not made sure that its
members are rigorously honoring the Security Council embargo
imposed in July. Uncut Angolan diamonds make their way to Belgium,
Britain, Israel, South Africa, the United States and other
countries, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, known as Unita, the Portuguese acronym for the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, have earned
$3.7 billion from diamonds since 1992, experts estimate. For much
of that time they controlled virtually all the diamond-producing
areas in Angola, where some of the world's finest gems are dug from
riverbanks.
</P>
<P>
   The report found that the failure of the embargo has let Unita
``restock munitions and supplies,'' which has ``fatally undermined
the peace process.'' More than 500,000 Angolans have died in the
civil war, which began in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an urgent need for the diamond business to
fundamentally change the way in which it works, because it is
clearly unacceptable for diamonds to be used as a major source of
revenue in conflict,'' said Charmain Gooch, a director of Global
Witness. ``How many people, when buying a diamond for their loved
one, have any idea of the horrific price that Angolans have had to
pay?''
</P>
<P>
   De Beers representatives said Monday that they did honor the
embargo. Any diamonds offered to their buyers in Belgium or Africa
``that are obviously of Angolan origin and don't have a certificate
from the Angolan government'' are refused, a spokesman said, even
if they have certificates that say they are from countries like
Zambia or Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Determining the origins of diamonds is difficult. A skilled
buyer shown many uncut stones from one area can make an educated
guess about the area of origin by the mixture of shape, color and
quality. With a single stone or a mixed bunch, that is impossible.
Chemical analysis is theoretically possible. But it is expensive
and would require drilling holes in each stone.
</P>
<P>
   Even if De Beers refuses stones Unita will easily find other
buyers, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The government and the rebels signed a peace treaty in 1994. But
disarming the soldiers and creating a coalition government has gone
slowly, and fighting has resumed in many regions.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting was particularly fierce early this month, as the
government attacked two Unita strongholds and met unexpectedly
tough resistance. One diplomat here said that the rebels had
launched counterattacks in the area, shooting down a government
plane Monday that was delivering food and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials acknowledged the latest round of fighting
for the first time this weekend.

BOEING'S BOARD KEEPS CONDIT ON THE JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ After a two-day meeting, The Boeing Co.'s board of
directors quietly left town Monday _ and Boeing Chairman Phil
Condit still had his job.
</P>
<P>
   There had been speculation from Seattle to Wall Street,
triggered in part by a Sunday story in The New York Times, that the
board would sack Condit because of the company's continued poor
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the speculation even led to a crazy rumor Monday
that General Electric was poised to buy Boeing and that Condit
would be replaced by his friend and GE boss John Welch Jr.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when the Dow Jones industrial average ended down more
than 126 points, Boeing's stock was up slightly as some investors
gambled that if the board fired Condit the company's stock would
rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Although board memebers did not issue any public show of support
for Condit, sources said the board took no action to remove the
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   But Condit took the unusual step of sending an e-mail late
Monday to Boeing managers asking them to disregard rumors and to
focus on getting the company back on track.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many, if not all of you, have heard or read media speculation
about senior management changes,'' Condit wrote. ``Rumors do not
contribute to doing the job that we have before us, so let me put
them to rest. The senior management team is in place and dedicated
to two things _ improving the profitability of The Boeing Co. and
securing its long term future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we reviewed with the board each of our three different
businesses. Aircraft and Missile Systems is profitable and looking
at how to grow its business profitably for the future. We are
investing heavily in Space and Communications for the future and
thus depressing near-term profitability to secure a very profitable
future. Commercial Airplanes is meeting delivery plans, but must
make significant changes to achieve its profit potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect every Boeing person to contribute to these tasks by
doing what we do best _ focusing on our customers and working to
find solutions to the problems that face us. Enough of rumors and
speculation; let's prove how good we are.''
</P>
<P>
   The board met in Seattle Sunday and Monday. It was a regularly
scheduled meeting and a spokesman said two-day meetings are not
unusual.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman added that he spent much of the day on ``rumor
control'' following published reports that Condit might be fired.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Boeing stunned Wall Street when it announced
that profits would not be what it hoped in 2000 and that it was
cutting its workforce by 20 percent, or about 48,000 jobs, by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had believed that Boeing, which suffered its first loss
in a half century last year, was finally getting its act together.
The latest batch of bad news immediately led to speculation that
Condit's days as head of the world's largest aerospace company were
numbered.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, The New York Times suggested in a lengthy Boeing
story that the board might fire Condit when it met Monday and
replace him with Harry Stonecipher, the former head of McDonnell
Douglas who became Boeing's president after last year's merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe there was hope on the part of some that Phil would get
the ax,'' said Bill Whitlow, an analyst at Safeco asset management
in Seattle. ``I didn't think that would happen, nor do I think it's
necessary. Most of the changes that have already been made are
probably enough to get the ship turned around.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyd Givan, Boeing's longtime chief financial officer, was the
first to resign under pressure earlier this year. In September,
Boeing's Commercial Airplane boss Ron Woodard was fired. He was
succeeded by Alan Mulally, who in turn replaced several key
managers with his own team.
</P>
<P>
   Whitlow, who manages a fund that holds 67,000 Boeing shares,
said many investors ``want blood.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been an absolute disaster,'' he said. ``But what can
be accomplished by firing Phil now. ... You need to have some
continuity in management. If Phil were to go and Harry took over,
you would have mostly non-Boeing people in the executive suite.
That might be okay for Wall Street, but not for the 160,000 people
who worked for Boeing before the merger (with McDonnell Douglas).
Morale is not good. It's more important to have continuity at the
top than to placate Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ``If Phil were fired and replaced by (GE's) Jack
Welch, maybe. But continuity makes more sense.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with the Post-Intelligencer, several industry
analysts said Monday that rumors were flying on Wall Street
throughout the trading session regarding Condit's possible removal
by the board.
</P>
<P>
   One rumor, that General Electric, the country's second biggest
company, would buy Boeing, may have been responsible for Boeing's
stock being up 7/16th Monday to close at 33 9/16 a share, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rumor was nonsense,'' said one analyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is just speculation,'' added Pierre Chao of Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter. ``A group of shareholders have been screaming
for Phil's head. But is it the right thing or not? Who knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Aseritis, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston,
agreed. But he also acknowledged that many analysts believe
Stonecipher might be better suited for the chairman's job than
Condit, an engineer by training.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could Harry change the fundamentals so that the commercial
margins in 2000 would be better? I'm not sure. But he would be more
pro-active. It's not Phil's nature to walk in and tell a guy he has
three months to turn this around,'' Aseritis said. ``Harry is much
more direct.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, Aseritis added, is that the company has not
done well under Condit.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a fact. The company has not done well and Phil's the
boss. But will he be replaced? No one but the board knows.''
</P>
<P>
   And Monday, the board decided that at least for now, Phil Condit
runs The Boeing Co.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, Dec. 15:
</P>
<P>
   The White House regards 20 to 30 Republican House members as
still in play on whether to vote against impeachment on Thursday.
Even allowing for exaggeration, the numbers suggest that for
reasons of political survival and principle, a significant bloc of
moderate Republicans is refusing to cave for the designated
speaker, Robert Livingston, and Rep. Tom DeLay, the whip who wags
the future speaker. These moderates should continue to hang tough,
now that President Clinton has indicated he may devote Wednesday to
lobbying, and the House minority leader, Richard Gephardt, promises
an all-out fight to force a censure vote.
</P>
<P>
   Oddsmakers might say that impeachment is a lock and censure is
dead, but we are into territory where the usual bets do not apply.
Even novel proposals like that on our Op-Ed page on Tuesday by
former Sen. Bob Dole for a joint resolution of condemnation cannot
be dismissed, for Washington is through the looking glass now. One
reason some Republicans remain uncommitted is that while Livingston
can play Henry VIII and threaten to punish moderates for the wacky
sin of giving ``insult to the chair,'' he cannot stop them from
reading polls. According to The New York Times/CBS News Polls, 64
percent of Americans oppose impeachment by the House, and 57
percent favor censure.
</P>
<P>
   The undecided Republicans are mainly from districts where
Clinton ran well in 1996, so they cannot afford to be as cavalier
as DeLay would like them to be about the public's correct
conclusion that Clinton's shameless, calculated lying does not rise
to the level of a high crime and misdemeanor. But this is not the
time for Republicans like Christopher Shays of Connecticut to go
wobbly and move into the impeachment column. Here are some other
key moderates who need to buy time for censure: Reps. Michael
Forbes, John McHugh, Rick Lazio, Sherwood Boehlert, Benjamin Gilman
and Sue Kelly, all of New York, and Reps. Nancy Johnson of
Connecticut and Jim Leach of Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Those who believe the House should not impeach need help from
the White House to meet the demand that Clinton admit that he lied
under oath, or at least signal that he would sign language to that
effect in a censure. It is throwing gasoline on flames for Gregory
Craig to condemn people who ``think one word is better than
another'' in demanding that Clinton admit to lies rather than
evasions. He represents a man who insists always on one word, not
the other, and then argues that the chosen word does not mean what
it has meant since the time of Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   Between now and the convening of the House on Thursday, words
will take on tremendous importance. They ought to be on the table
for negotiation on Wednesday when Clinton has a chance to meet with
Shays and other moderates who are trying to save him and also
preserve a proper constitutional interpretation of impeachment.
Although a president is always due respect, they should not be
bullied by Clinton's self-defeating stubbornness. If he is
determined to lose the impeachment vote, he should at least do so
after hearing sounder advice than his lawyers have given him.
</P>
<P>
   As for Livingston, his unfounded position that the Constitution
does not allow for censure has been refuted by the New York City
Bar Association. Before even taking the oath as speaker, he has
proved that he cannot handle the intimidators he inherited from
Speaker Newt Gingrich. Indeed, who could have guessed he would
create nostalgia for Gingrich so quickly?

   BRITAIN: CHALLENGE BY PINOCHET
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Gen. Augusto Pinochet said they would turn to
England's High Court to challenge the approval last week by Home
Secretary Jack Straw of the Spanish petition to extradite their
client to Madrid to face charges of crimes against humanity. In
another legal move, the lawyers will go to the House of Lords to
seek a review of its decision denying the former Chilean dictator
immunity from arrest.

   GERMANY: NUCLEAR DISCORD
</P>
<P>
   In a spat with his coalition partners, Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder blocked his own Environment Minister from talks with
electricity executives about the government's plans to shut down
nuclear plants. The minister, Jurgen Tritten of the Green Party,
favors a tougher approach to phasing out nuclear power than
Schroeder and his Social Democratic Party.

LONDON AND DUBLIN TACKLE DUAL THREAT TO NORTH'S PACT  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES F. CLARITY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ The British and Irish governments
moved Monday to deal with rising tension between the Protestant
majority and the Roman Catholic minority in this British province.
</P>
<P>
   The hostility stems from the lagging peace effort and from an
old dispute about a Protestant parade through a Catholic area. The
police fear new violence.
</P>
<P>
   The offices of Prime Ministers Tony Blair of Britain and Bertie
Ahern of the Irish Republic made it clear that they wanted results
before Christmas. The prime ministers apparently talked to Northern
leaders by phone Monday, urging compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many sharks in the water,'' said David
McKittrick, author of several standard reference works on Northern
Ireland. ``But it would be overstating it to say the thing is on
the point of collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   The work of the new Northern Ireland Assembly, which is supposed
to enact the peace agreement, has stalled over a dispute about when
the Irish Republican Army must disarm. Protestant unionists, who
want to remain part of Britain, say it must start very soon.
Catholic nationalists, who want all of Ireland united, point out
that the agreement stipulates only disarmament by May 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Recent days have seen sharper invective between David Trimble,
the Protestant who is first minister of the assembly, and officials
of Sinn Fein, the IRA political wing. Trimble has barred Sinn Fein
from full participation in the peace effort until the IRA begins to
disarm.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, in his speech accepting the Nobel Peace Prize in
Oslo, Trimble described ``dark doubts about whether Sinn Fein is
drinking from the clear stream of democracy, or still drinking from
the dark stream of fascism.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein officials said that Trimble was trying to provoke an
IRA attack, but that it would continue to observe the cease-fire it
has held for 16 months.
</P>
<P>
   The police say the situation may encourage new attacks by IRA
mavericks. The Irish police chief, Pat Byrne, said he was sending
extra antiterror specialists to the border, a staging area of
recent attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere has also been contaminated by an old dispute over
an annual Protestant parade through a Catholic area of Portadown,
near Belfast. The march marks a 1690 Protestant victory over
Catholics. It was banned in July after the Catholic residents
protested.
</P>
<P>
   Since then hundreds of Protestants have stayed in the Drumcree
church area, poised to move into the Catholic zone. They have
recently clashed with the police.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, authorities said they would allow a limited march
Saturday. Some Protestant hard-liners threaten to break security
lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drumcree,'' said McKittrick, ``the heart of darkness of
Northern Ireland.''

<P>
   ``We are expecting some more assassinations,'' a source close to
the Iranian security services remarked to me a couple of weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   When he spoke, Darioush Forouhar and his wife had already been
murdered _ but the latest grisly murder of three more Iranians had
yet to be committed.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Khatemi went to the United States to speak at the
U.N., to tell Iranian people to come back, to invest, to promise
them that in Iran everything is now done according to the law.
Forouhar's murder was an attempt to show the world _ and Iranians _
that Iran is not safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the demonstration of lawlessness has gone beyond even my
informant's worst nightmares. Mohamed Jafar Pouyandeh had been
missing since last Wednesday and his body was found only on Sunday;
the 45-year-old writer had apparently been strangled.
</P>
<P>
   Just four days earlier, another writer _ Mohamed Mokhtari _ had
been found on a garbage heap, also strangled.
</P>
<P>
   Forouhar, leader of the small opposition Iran Nation Party, and
his wife Pavaneh were both stabbed to death in November. A third
writer, Majid Sharif, also died last month, though relatives say he
may have had a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   But the Islamic Republic is clearly the victim of a very creepy
series of assaults on the country's newly liberated intelligentsia,
the sadism of the attacks as frightening as the threat it obviously
represents to President Mohamed Khatami who is _ lest it be
forgotten _ perhaps the most popularly elected leader in the entire
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody wants to destroy the civil society Khatami proclaimed
after his election last year and the usual suspects are being
fingered.
</P>
<P>
   The clerics who never accepted any deviation from Ayatollah
Khomeini's anti-western, theocratic regime _ the Supreme Leader,
Ayatollah Ali Akbar Khamenei, and his supporters _ obviously come
to mind.
</P>
<P>
   Who was behind the trial of Tehran's progressive mayor,
Gholamhussein Karbaschi _ a Khatami ally _ on dubious charges of
corruption? Who organized the stone-throwing attack on a bus-load
of American tourists last month? The ``Fedayin of Islam'' who
claimed responsibility was clearly a cover-name.
</P>
<P>
   Who planned the assault on Ataollah Mohadjerani, Khatami's
spokesman, who was pushed to the floor of a mosque after Friday
prayers and beaten up?
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed Rezai, the young son of a senior Iranian official, said in
the United states that Ayatollah Khamenei and his colleagues were
planning a coup against President Khatami. But the Iranian security
services have apparently not come to any conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   True, Forouhar had ``criticized Khamenei too much,'' as one
Tehran businessman put it obliquely. Before her death, his wife
Pavaneh had told the New York-based Human Rights Watch that the
couple lived in fear of being murdered, adding that they thanked
God each evening for granting them another day on earth.
</P>
<P>
   But one Tehran daily newspaper _ its editor no friend of the
Supreme Leader and its owner none other than the deposed mayor
Kharbaschi _ pointed out that the gruesome murders may be an
outside attempt to set Iranians against the Revolutionary Guards
and Ayatollah Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must remember that the CIA pushed small groups in Italy to
kill opposition people so as to sew suspicion,'' the Iranian
security source said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many people in the West who do not want our
president to succeed, who would like him to fail so that Iran can
be regarded again as a backward country full of what you call
`terrorists.' The Americans have not responded to Khatami enough
and some people in Washington don't want to see enlightenment in
Iran.''
</P>
<P>
   The killings have come when Iran's democracy is beginning to
take on a human and very real shape.
</P>
<P>
   A new reform party, the Islamic Iran Participation Front, has
just been founded by more than a hundred political and cultural
figures to stand behind President Khatami's supporters in
February's municipal elections _ a poll with a million candidates
for 250,000 local government seats which will give wide
decentralized powers to town councils throughout Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The founders of the new party include a vice-president, four
ministers, seven deputy ministers, nine journalists, a poet, a film
producer and two student union leaders.
</P>
<P>
   So broad is the spectrum of political debate that Iranians must
read at least six newspapers to understand what is happening to
their country.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has taken Iran off the U.S. list of countries that
allegedly fail to fight the production and trafficking of drugs,
though given Iran's ferocious series of executions of drug barons,
this is not surprising.
</P>
<P>
   President Khatami's approaches to the United States have been
accompanied by new relations with the Arab Gulf states. Crown
Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia attended the Organization of
Islamic Conference summit in Tehran a year ago and now Khatami has
been invited to visit the Kingdom by King Fahd.
</P>
<P>
   Iran has meanwhile refused to be intimidated by American claims
that it is developing weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   And the Iranian defense minister, Ali Shamkhani, has warned that
an Israeli attack on Syria _ Iran's ally since the early 1980s _
will be met by an Iranian military response.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is an Israeli attack against Syria, we'll reply in a
way which the Israelis cannot imagine,'' he said in September, just
after the Iranians showed for the first time their Shehab-3 missile
which has a minimum 1,300-km range which could include Israel,
Turkey, the Gulf or even parts of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Iran still has its enemies outside its borders who
would be as pleased to see the collapse of President Khatami's
``civil society'' as his domestic opponents. &QL;

   BONN _ While other countries are still struggling to erect a
fitting archway to the new century, Germany has completed its
millennium project a year ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   A jury of seven eminent persons from the German-speaking world
Monday unveiled their definitive list of the 100 most important
words of the last 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   From AIDS to ``Wolkenkratzer' _ skyscraper _ modernity is
distilled onto a small sheet. Between now and Jan. 31, 1999, more
eminent German-speakers will pen riveting essays on each word,
which will all be broadcast during the coming 12 months, and the
printed versions will be bound in a nice leather volume. Beat that,
Millenium Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe it can. One eminent female person in Berlin has
already spotted one blatant omission _ the list has ``peace
movement'' but not ``women's movement.'' Historians are also
feeling a little let down.
</P>
<P>
   Germans have been living in interesting times, so competition to
get into the top 100 was fierce. ``Fuhrer'' made it, as well as
``Holocaust,'' ``concentration camp,'' ``deportation'' and
``genocide.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nazis did not merit an entry, even though the foreign
concept of ``fascism'' got in. And whereas the ``Third World'' was
deemed worthy of inclusion, ``Third Reich'' was not.
</P>
<P>
   As befitting a century of wars, the list is weighed down by many
military terms. ``Panzer,'' ``Molotov cocktail'' and ``U-boat'' are
the epoch-making words. ``Luftkrieg'' _ aerial warfare _ is there,
but strangely, ``Blitzkrieg'' is not.
</P>
<P>
   From the Anglo-Saxon world the German language acquired several
treasures, including ``design,'' ``comics,'' ``jeans'' and ``sex.''
From contemporary politics, it has gained almost nothing except
``reunification.'' From industry, ``Volkswagen'' made it as the
only trademark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Currency reform,'' the creation of the mighty deutsche mark 50
years ago, obviously had a deep enough impact to be included in the
gallery of important words. But ``monetary union,'' due to take
place in two weeks' time, will have to fight its way into the top
100 in the coming century. &QL;

 c.1998 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Hassan, a young Palestinian in Jabalya refugee camp
close to the center of Gaza city, was not happy as he waited for
the Palestinian leadership to drop the anti-Israel clauses in the
Palestinian charter. ``I want the refugees to be able to go back
before they change it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   These were not wise words on a day when Yasser Arafat, the
Palestinian leader, was straining every nerve to make a success of
the visit of U.S. President Bill Clinton to Gaza, the self-ruled
Palestinian enclave.
</P>
<P>
   Eight plainclothes policemen stepped forward to remove Hassan
for a quick interrogation over what he had said about the visiting
American leader.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians in the streets of Gaza were skeptical. Ibrahim Ali,
a money changer watched impassively as Hassan was arrested. ``The
Clinton visit may put us on the road to a state, but it does more
for (Arafat's) Palestinian Authority that it does for the people,''
he said. ``Gaza is still just one big prison.''
</P>
<P>
   None of these private doubts would have been evident to
President Clinton when his helicopter landed at the newly opened
Gaza International Airport Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The control tower had almost disappeared inside two enormous
American and Palestinian flags. Wall posters showed Clinton and
Arafat, apparently hand in hand, with the slogan: ``We Have A
Dream.'' Offshore, a flotilla of festively decorated Palestinian
fishing boats moved up and down the coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except for Monica (Lewinsky), nobody loves President Clinton
like Arafat,'' said an American diplomat cited by the Israeli
press.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton and Arafat addressed the Palestinian leadership in
the Shawwa Center in the heart of Gaza later in the day, Arafat
several times enfolded the U.S. president's hands in his own.
</P>
<P>
   In words that cast light on the importance he invests in this
visit, the Palestinian leader repeated: ``Palestine is reborn
again, reborn again.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian police and soldiers were making strenuous efforts to
ensure nothing might spoil the rebirth. All the streets in central
Gaza were closed to traffic. There were checkpoints every 200 yards
on roads far from where the American and Palestinian leaders were
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   A small boy with a Palestinian flag attached to the back of
bicycle who tried to drive down the road which goes past Arafat's
headquarters was rapidly turned around by three soldiers with
submachine guns.
</P>
<P>
   In Shati refugee camp, where Hillary Clinton was expected to
visit a women's center, Lt. Subhi Azami, who had grown up in Beirut
and had fought against the Israel invasion of Lebanon in 1982, was
directing hundreds of police and soldiers as they sealed off roads.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that Mrs. Clinton, unlike her husband, had said
she hoped the Palestinians would have their own state.
</P>
<P>
   Looking around at the narrow lanes and block houses, whose
poverty a last-minute cleanup did not conceal, he said: ``Maybe the
Americans will see how we are suffering here.'' As he spoke, two
Israeli jets soared overhead, emphasizing the limits of Palestinian
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   The anxiety about security was as much American as Palestinian.
Diplomats from the American embassy in Tel Aviv had moved en masse
to the Holiday Inn in Ashkelon just up the coast in Israel. From
there they have commuted each day for weeks to organize the visit.
</P>
<P>
   None have been allowed to spend one night in Gaza. ``You've
never seen such paranoia,'' one complained.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has walked down so many red carpets to meet foreign
leaders in the past 30 years that the people of Gaza are dubious
about how much good President Clinton's visit will do them.
</P>
<P>
   For once, their cynicism may be misplaced. On arriving at the
airport the American leader said the Palestinian people were free
to ``determine their own destiny on their own land.'' He cut a
ribbon to open the airport, though it was opened with great fanfare
several weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat is relishing the change in American policy towards the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago a senior American official, prematurely
assigning the Palestine Liberation Organization to its grave, said:
``Bye, bye PLO.'' Monday President Clinton was addressing its
leaders, all dressed in suits and uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Palestinians see it as the beginning of the fulfillment of
a messianic vision and an independent state,'' writes Hemi Shalev,
the Israeli commentator. ``They are drunk with the smell of the
strategic revolution they have carried in their relations with the
American government.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's strategy has been to agree to everything the Americans
wanted. Monday he got his reward.
</P>
<P>
   He had signed on to the Wye Plantation agreement in October
under which he will get back only 13 percent of land on the West
Bank. This means that Israel will continue to hold one-third of the
Gaza Strip and 60 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech President Clinton praised the Palestinians for
continuing to negotiate when they had good reasons ``for walking
away.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time President Clinton sympathetically mentioned
Palestinian grievances such as the prisoners still held by Israel,
Jewish settlements, the confiscation of land and demolition of
Palestinian homes.
</P>
<P>
   He compared the grief of the children of Palestinian prisoners
to that of the children of Israelis who were killed fighting
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   None of this will be good news for Benjamin Netanyahu, the
Israeli prime minister, whose prolonged delay in implementing the
Oslo accords is blamed by many Israelis for changing American
attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   There was something plaintive in the way President Clinton told
the Palestinians that they should revoke the clauses in the
Palestinian charter.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton may suspect that the Israeli withdrawal from
another 5 percent of the West Bank scheduled for next Friday, is
not going to take place.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu is fighting for his political life. He needs the
support of the hard right to save his coalition in a parliamentary
confidence vote next week. He will not get it if the withdrawal
goes ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians in Jabalya refugee camp may be right to wonder how
many of the fine words spoken in Gaza Monday will turn into
reality. &QL;

EDNEY HAS KEY TO LOCKOUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kenny Anderson makes it sound as though poverty is a three-car
garage. Patrick Ewing would have you believe those bells the
Salvation Army Santas are ringing this holiday season toll for
locked-out basketball players.
</P>
<P>
   Perspective has been held hostage by the NBA for 168 days now,
its captors revealing through their communiques that even though
they can palm a basketball with the greatest of ease, their grip on
the real world is tenuous at best.
</P>
<P>
   The voice of the lockout that drones on and on, so distant and
defiant, doesn't speak for the NBA's silent majority. The players
left disenfranchised by the work stoppage aren't difficult to
locate, except for a conversation. In the case of former UCLA
standout Tyus Edney, even his own family has a hard time getting a
hold of him.
</P>
<P>
   You can try ringing him on his cell phone, but it's a gamble,
and not because some seedy photographer might be monitoring the
call. It's a roll of the dice, negotiating the time difference and
the language and the scratchy connection to touch base with Edney
in Lithuania.
</P>
<P>
   He has called the Baltic state home since August, reluctantly
leaving his wife and their newborn daughter behind in the
Northridge section of Los Angeles to play for Lithuanian Basketball
League's version of the Chicago Bulls. Somebody's got to keep
Kennedi in diapers, and if that means Edney misses her first words
and steps and her baby's breath on his neck, well, he hopes that
makes union leader Billy Hunter happy.
</P>
<P>
   Edney, 25, backed up Anderson in Boston last season, for
something less than the millionaire's wages that afforded Anderson
the luxury of owning eight cars and allotting himself $10,000 a
month in mad money. Edney earned $400,000 before taxes in 1998, a
king's ransom by most people's standards but far less than the
league average of $2.6 million, and not enough to secure his
future.
</P>
<P>
   Dare we say the percentage of gross revenues that the owners and
players' union are haggling over is largely irrelevant to players
of Edney's ilk?
</P>
<P>
   As a free agent, Edney couldn't be sure where _ or even if _
he'd be playing in 1998-99 even before the work stoppage stalled
everybody's NBA careers. The league's padlocked doors made it
impossible for Edney to shop himself around to clubs over the
summer. When Kaunas Zalgiris came after him in August, Edney
decided he couldn't afford not to jump at its offer, which included
the use of an apartment and a car.
</P>
<P>
   The timing was awkward, what with his wife Buffy just weeks away
from delivering the couple's first child. Edney had friends in the
NBA who told him he was crazy, not just for leaving his family but
for abandoning the NBA before a single game had been canceled. The
contract Edney signed with Zalgiris stipulated that he must see the
season through to its end, in April or May.
</P>
<P>
   Four months after Edney kissed his wife, his week-old daughter
and the NBA goodbye, some of the same friends who thought him
foolish are scrambling to secure playing gigs in Europe as the
prospect of salvaging the NBA season dims. It's not a good sign
when Edney and his wife are managing to have telephone
conversations that last longer than the latest NBA bargaining
session.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of what Edney has to say in those calls, you could glean
without resorting to the use of any illegal electronic device. The
way he describes it, it's a whole different way of life on the
other side of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Edney had some idea of what he was getting himself into, having
watched George Zidek, a native of the Czech Republic, struggle to
bridge the same cultural chasm in college. The two basketball
players were roommates at UCLA for two years, during which time
Edney talked a discouraged Zidek out of returning home more than
once.
</P>
<P>
   Now Zidek is returning the favor. The center, who finished the
1997-98 season glued to the bench in Seattle, is the leading scorer
on the same Lithuanian squad that employs Edney. Zidek and his wife
often have Edney over for a home-cooked meal, no small pleasure
given that the first McDonald's preceded Edney to Lithuania by only
a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Edney lives over a restaurant and feeds off the local ambiance.
The Lithuanians eat up their basketball, especially the exploits of
Zalgiris, which counts among its co-owners one of the country's
Olympic heroes, Portland Trailblazer center Arvydas Sabonis.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Lakers, Knicks or Bulls, Zalgiris has its own celebrity
following. Among those who cheer the team is the president of the
country, Valdas Adamkus, a native son who resided in Chicago for 40
years after fleeing Communist rule. He served as an official in the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency before recently returning to
his roots and successfully running for office.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Dariaus ir Gireno Sports Palace (capacity 4,350) nor
the Kausta Sports Hall (capacity 1,000) where Zalgiris plays its
games is likely to be confused with the old Chicago Staduim or the
United Center. Not that Edney is complaining. The team performs
nightly in front of rollicking sellout crowds, which is more than
Edney could say about his days as a Sacramento King or Boston
Celtic.
</P>
<P>
   Edney is averaging 21 minutes, 9.7 points and 4.7 assists for
Zalgiris, which finished the LKL regular season at 18-0. The squad
will play in the EuroLeague for the next few months before
rejoining the LKL playoffs in progress in April.
</P>
<P>
   When Edney's parents or wife reach him on his cell phone these
days, they can hear something loud and clear through the static and
the few-seconds delay. More than homesickness, there is unbridled
joy in Edney's voice.
</P>
<P>
   It's a shame Edney had to travel so far to reclaim his lost love
for the game. What's sadder still is that so many of his brethren
back home have strayed so far from what first attracted them to
basketball.

FOR THE JETS, THE SKY IS SUDDENLY THE LIMIT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Grudgingly, but with a hint of admiration,
Bill Parcells said Monday that his playoff-bound Jets were ready
for Buffalo on Saturday, a game that could launch them to a
division title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my team has the mentality now to play in this kind of
game the whole way,'' the coach said the morning after a 21-16
victory over Miami put the Jets in the playoffs for the first time
since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   It can get even better for the Jets and their fans, who have not
seen a home playoff game since 1986. The Jets can not only capture
their division by winning one of their last two games, but also get
a first-round playoff bye by staying even with the American
Football Conference Central leader, Jacksonville. Each has a 10-4
record. But the Jets would win all the tie breakers and would be
the second-seeded team behind Denver, guaranteeing a bye. The Jets
could know this by the close of business next Sunday night, when
Jacksonville plays at Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   For Parcells, Sunday night's victory over Miami helped him
continue a 14-year-old tradition. In each of his three coaching
posts, first with the Giants in 1984, and then with the Patriots,
he has taken a downtrodden, losing team into the playoffs in his
second season. And since Parcells arrived, the Jets are 19-11 _
better over that span than any team in the AFC except for Denver
and Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   For his players, there was a more important accomplishment: They
have stopped thinking of themselves as upstarts. Their record is
punctuated with a remarkably complementary offense and defense.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Cascadden, the linebacker who returned a Dan Marino fumble
for the crushing score Sunday night, had lived through a 4-28
record his first two years with the team. So, what's it like to see
light at the end of the tunnel?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been through that tunnel for a while,'' Cascadden said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, this has not been a fluke season for the Jets. Rather,
it is one in which they have grown almost weekly, with a few
setbacks in losses to teams that, based on the Jets' current
standard of play, would probably not be repeated.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets have occupied first place a few times over the years
since they captured their last division title in 1969, in the old
American Football League. But since then, they have never been in
first place after 14 games, as they are now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not into that decades stuff,'' Parcells said Monday. ``I'm
not sentimental.''
</P>
<P>
   He has had the ability on the Jets to build a team the way he
wants it. ``You've got to coordinate,'' he said of his staff. ``One
thing George Young and I never had a problem with on the Giants was
deciding on players.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells also has no problems with his longtime staff. Bill
Belichick again helped draft a defensive game plan that stymied and
angered Marino, the Dolphins' quarterback. Marino was sacked five
times _ equaling his worst day as a pro. He was intercepted once.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the Jets' defense was able to change on the fly.
Jets players are continually surprised each week by the unusual
defenses Belichick devises, new ways to haunt old rivals. For
example, after Seattle's Joey Galloway caught a pair of bombs for
touchdowns against Aaron Glenn, he didn't get another pass all game
_ even though Glenn was injured and replaced by Ray Mickens.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' offense is equally adaptable, evolving under the new
coordinator, Charlie Weis, whose game plans get considerable input
from quarterback coach Dan Henning. After the Jets trounced the
Falcons, 28-3, Atlanta Coach Dan Reeves told Parcells, ``We had a
lot of trouble preparing for you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins were exploited, too. They were not accustomed to
seeing so many three- and four-receiver alignments. They were
confused when tight ends lined up as flankers and Wayne Chrebet
appeared out of nowhere to dash to the goal line. The Dolphins, who
came in with the stingiest defense in the league (the Jets are
second), were caught in a monumental mismatch on a pick play when
their ponderous linebacker, Robert Jones, wound up trying to cover
the elusive Chrebet. Result: touchdown. On the play before, Chrebet
had produced a 52-yard reception on third down.
</P>
<P>
   Those crucial downs at clutch times are when the Jets have
shined this season. Quarterback Vinny Testaverde has nine touchdown
passes and no interceptions on third down, leading the league;
Chrebet leads the conference in third-down receiving yardage (378)
and Keyshawn Johnson is the only receiver in the AFC with six
touchdowns on third-down passes.
</P>
<P>
   The team Parcells has created has only a few holdovers with
exceptional talent: Johnson and Chrebet, Mo Lewis and Glenn. But
three defensive linemen from Belichick's Cleveland years _ Ernie
Logan, Rick Lyle and Anthony Pleasant _ were picked up as free
agents and now start. Testaverde was out there, too, and available
during the off season. So was Bryan Cox.
</P>
<P>
   Before this season, Parcells believed it might be more difficult
to make the playoffs than it was to take the wreckage of the 1-15
team of 1996 and make it a 9-7 winner last year. Monday he spoke of
the difficulty of this season's tougher schedule, of the 0-2 start
and a realization that ``people are shooting for us.'' So far,
though, the Jets have prevailed, including prime-time road
victories at New England and Miami, and triumphs at Kansas City and
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``That makes a big difference,'' Parcells said. ``I think
they've done an excellent job on the road. We've beaten some good
teams on the road. I think we beat them at a time when most of them
were on top of their game.''

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Hassan, a young Palestinian in Jabalya refugee camp
close to the center of Gaza city, was not happy as he waited for
the Palestinian leadership to drop the anti-Israel clauses in the
Palestinian charter. ``I want the refugees to be able to go back
before they change it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   These were not wise words on a day when Yasser Arafat, the
Palestinian leader, was straining every nerve to make a success of
the visit of U.S. President Bill Clinton to Gaza, the self-ruled
Palestinian enclave.
</P>
<P>
   Eight plainclothes policemen stepped forward to remove Hassan
for a quick interrogation over what he had said about the visiting
American leader.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians in the streets of Gaza were skeptical. Ibrahim Ali,
a money changer watched impassively as Hassan was arrested. ``The
Clinton visit may put us on the road to a state, but it does more
for (Arafat's) Palestinian Authority that it does for the people,''
he said. ``Gaza is still just one big prison.''
</P>
<P>
   None of these private doubts would have been evident to
President Clinton when his helicopter landed at the newly opened
Gaza International Airport Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The control tower had almost disappeared inside two enormous
American and Palestinian flags. Wall posters showed Clinton and
Arafat, apparently hand in hand, with the slogan: ``We Have A
Dream.'' Offshore, a flotilla of festively decorated Palestinian
fishing boats moved up and down the coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except for Monica (Lewinsky), nobody loves President Clinton
like Arafat,'' said an American diplomat cited by the Israeli
press.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton and Arafat addressed the Palestinian leadership in
the Shawwa Center in the heart of Gaza later in the day, Arafat
several times enfolded the U.S. president's hands in his own.
</P>
<P>
   In words that cast light on the importance he invests in this
visit, the Palestinian leader repeated: ``Palestine is reborn
again, reborn again.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian police and soldiers were making strenuous efforts to
ensure nothing might spoil the rebirth. All the streets in central
Gaza were closed to traffic. There were checkpoints every 200 yards
on roads far from where the American and Palestinian leaders were
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   A small boy with a Palestinian flag attached to the back of
bicycle who tried to drive down the road which goes past Arafat's
headquarters was rapidly turned around by three soldiers with
submachine guns.
</P>
<P>
   In Shati refugee camp, where Hillary Clinton was expected to
visit a women's center, Lt. Subhi Azami, who had grown up in Beirut
and had fought against the Israel invasion of Lebanon in 1982, was
directing hundreds of police and soldiers as they sealed off roads.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that Mrs. Clinton, unlike her husband, had said
she hoped the Palestinians would have their own state.
</P>
<P>
   Looking around at the narrow lanes and block houses, whose
poverty a last-minute cleanup did not conceal, he said: ``Maybe the
Americans will see how we are suffering here.'' As he spoke, two
Israeli jets soared overhead, emphasizing the limits of Palestinian
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   The anxiety about security was as much American as Palestinian.
Diplomats from the American embassy in Tel Aviv had moved en masse
to the Holiday Inn in Ashkelon just up the coast in Israel. From
there they have commuted each day for weeks to organize the visit.
</P>
<P>
   None have been allowed to spend one night in Gaza. ``You've
never seen such paranoia,'' one complained.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has walked down so many red carpets to meet foreign
leaders in the past 30 years that the people of Gaza are dubious
about how much good President Clinton's visit will do them.
</P>
<P>
   For once, their cynicism may be misplaced. On arriving at the
airport the American leader said the Palestinian people were free
to ``determine their own destiny on their own land.'' He cut a
ribbon to open the airport, though it was opened with great fanfare
several weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat is relishing the change in American policy towards the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago a senior American official, prematurely
assigning the Palestine Liberation Organization to its grave, said:
``Bye, bye PLO.'' Monday President Clinton was addressing its
leaders, all dressed in suits and uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Palestinians see it as the beginning of the fulfillment of
a messianic vision and an independent state,'' writes Hemi Shalev,
the Israeli commentator. ``They are drunk with the smell of the
strategic revolution they have carried in their relations with the
American government.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's strategy has been to agree to everything the Americans
wanted. Monday he got his reward.
</P>
<P>
   He had signed on to the Wye Plantation agreement in October
under which he will get back only 13 percent of land on the West
Bank. This means that Israel will continue to hold one-third of the
Gaza Strip and 60 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech President Clinton praised the Palestinians for
continuing to negotiate when they had good reasons ``for walking
away.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time President Clinton sympathetically mentioned
Palestinian grievances such as the prisoners still held by Israel,
Jewish settlements, the confiscation of land and demolition of
Palestinian homes.
</P>
<P>
   He compared the grief of the children of Palestinian prisoners
to that of the children of Israelis who were killed fighting
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   None of this will be good news for Benjamin Netanyahu, the
Israeli prime minister, whose prolonged delay in implementing the
Oslo accords is blamed by many Israelis for changing American
attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   There was something plaintive in the way President Clinton told
the Palestinians that they should revoke the clauses in the
Palestinian charter.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton may suspect that the Israeli withdrawal from
another 5 percent of the West Bank scheduled for next Friday, is
not going to take place.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu is fighting for his political life. He needs the
support of the hard right to save his coalition in a parliamentary
confidence vote next week. He will not get it if the withdrawal
goes ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians in Jabalya refugee camp may be right to wonder how
many of the fine words spoken in Gaza Monday will turn into
reality. &QL;

<P>
   BANGKOK _ By the close of bidding Tuesday afternoon, Thailand
will mark a watershed in the restructuring of Asia's crisis-hit
economies.
</P>
<P>
   On the auction block will be business loans worth nearly half of
the 860 billion baht ($24.03 billion) in assets seized by the
government last year when it shut down much of the country's
financial sector and closed 56 finance companies.
</P>
<P>
   The loans will be sold at a discount to their full value _ up to
60 percent, experts say _ to companies hoping to recover enough
money from the borrowers to make a profit.
</P>
<P>
   But the prices of Tuesday's bids are less important, several
economists said, than the demonstration that Thailand is
restructuring quickly under its $17 billion aid program from the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thailand is setting a benchmark for clearing out bad loans and
this auction will be watched throughout Asia,'' said Jim Walker,
chief economist of Credit Lyonnais. ``After sparking the crisis,
Thailand is taking the lead in cleaning up.''
</P>
<P>
   The rapid pace of Thailand's asset sell-off, which will largely
be complete if everything is sold Tuesday, places the country's
realignment ahead of Indonesia and South Korea, Asia's other two
recipients of multibillion-dollar IMF bailouts, according to Chi
Lo, senior international economist at Hongkong &AMP; Shanghai Banking
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Thailand is allowing foreign companies to bid.
Among those expected to participate are General Electric Capital
Corp. and Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keeping foreigners out of the banking sector was really a
sacred cow in the Asian model, but this auction is breaking that
system down,'' Lo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Korea, Indonesia and Malaysia really need this sort of auction
soon too, but the first two have not even set a date and Malaysia's
current policies would not allow it to take place.''
</P>
<P>
   Full economic restructuring, however, is far from complete and
faces mounting resistance from critics who say that Thailand, the
only country in Southeast Asia that was never colonized, is now
being sold cheaply to Western bankers.
</P>
<P>
   Led by a group of wealthy senators, opponents of IMF reforms
have already delayed passage of foreclosure and bankruptcy laws
intended to punish delinquent debtors by allowing banks to
repossess collateral.
</P>
<P>
   The laws, which the government attempted to pass earlier this
year, would have significantly increased bidding prices at
Tuesday's auction of unpaid business loans, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   The 13,192 loans have a face value of 371 billion baht, but
analysts expect they will sell for at least 60 percent less, with
as many as half not selling at all.
</P>
<P>
   The 15 potential bidders each paid 500,000 baht to examine the
loan documents. Brought together from the 56 defunct finance
companies, the business loans to be sold Tuesday have been
subdivided into 42 lots, each grouping an industry or type of
collateral, such as loans to hotels or steel companies.
</P>
<P>
   As a concession to complaints that the auction favors wealthy
foreign institutions, bidders can commit up to four times their
capital funds by signing up for several lots in order of
preference.
</P>
<P>
   The deadline for submitting an envelope of bids is 1 P.M.
Tuesday and results will be announced within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Unsold lots will be auctioned in a second round, in which the
government's Asset Management Corp. will participate. There is no
minimum price, but low bids will be rejected if authorities deem
them ``artificially low,'' according to Amaret Sila-On, chairman of
the Financial Sector Restructuring Authority.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how little money the auction raises, however,
knowledge of the prices will automatically push forward the next
stage of Thailand's recovery, according to David Fernandez, a
Singapore-based regional economist for J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   The amount paid for the loans will allow banks to estimate the
necessary level of provisions for bad loans and help break the ice
with corporate restructuring as the new creditors start talking to
the companies that owe money, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the process gets under way, I think we could see a rapid
acceleration in bank recapitalization and corporate
restructuring,'' Fernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   Walker of Credit Lyonnais, who was severely criticized by Thai
authorities last year when he correctly predicted the fall of the
baht months before it occurred, said early signs showed the Thai
economy had hit a pretty solid bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a yearly basis, the `headline' numbers are still way out of
the ballpark,'' he said, referring to the plunge in sales of cars
by 72 percent and motorcycles by 52 percent this year through
October.
</P>
<P>
   By examining shorter periods and making seasonal adjustments,
Walker reckons Thailand's economy bottomed out last March. ``If you
wait for headline figures to change, you've already missed the
recovery,'' he said. &QL;

BRIBERY CHARGE STUDIED BY SPECIAL IOC BOARD
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ In this era of EPO and human growth
hormone and widespread skepticism about world records, it required
something remarkable to reduce doping to a minor topic at an
International Olympic Committee meeting. It required evidence of
bribery within the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that evidence leads to resignations or expulsions
depends largely on conclusions reached by a special commission
composed of IOC executive board members who are nearly all lawyers.
The commission was formed here to investigate a scholarship fund
created in 1991 by the bid committee from Salt Lake City that
benefited at least six relatives of IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   Before the executive board meeting concluded Monday, the
commission met at least four times with Salt Lake City Olympic
organizing committee members. Commission chairman Dick Pound did
not rule out further meetings and said the commission hoped to
finish its work by the end of January, before the executive board
meets here on the eve of the world conference on doping.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Schultz, executive director of the U.S. Olympic Committee,
said: ``In a way, the Salt Lake City situation is a blessing in
disguise for the IOC. It's the first time they have some facts. We
live in such a litigious society today that, without hard facts, it
is really difficult to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake City's organizing committee had said the scholarship
payments, which amounted to slightly less than $400,000, came from
a privately financed fund that existed from 1991 to 1995. In 1991,
Salt Lake City lost the bid for the 1998 Winter Games to Nagano,
Japan, and in 1995 won the bid for the 2002 Games.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Marsh, a four-time Olympian who is a Salt Lake City
committee trustee, said Monday that he wanted an accounting of the
fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``If some heads have to roll, then so be it,'' he told The
Associated Press. ``This went over the line. And I'll say right now
that if it turns out that I should have known about this, then I'll
resign. That is not what the Olympic movement is about.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Intermountain Health Care, Utah's largest health care
provider, confirmed that in 1994 it gave free surgical services to
at least two people associated with the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   One key question was why it took the IOC until 1998 to come up
with facts made public when a Salt Lake City television station
obtained an incriminating letter and disclosed the existence of the
scholarship fund. The IOC regularly debriefs candidate cities after
votes in an attempt to monitor the selection process. According to
Marc Hodler, an IOC member from Switzerland whose voice was the
most audible here despite a reminder from International Olympic
Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch that he was not an
official spokesman, debriefings are not conducive to candor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The winners never say anything because they have a bad
conscience,'' Hodler said. ``The losers only give information if
they have decided never to run again, and most of them think they
want to run again.''
</P>
<P>
   Hodler said that the British bidding team from Manchester, which
bid unsuccessfully for the Summer Olympics, was among the most
helpful, but he added: ``The only things I found out were things I
already knew. And as a lawyer, I know well that they were the sorts
of things that would have someone in an American court yelling,
`Hearsay.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Hodler was front and center again Monday when the international
winter sports federations met with the executive board. Because
Hodler, 80, is president of the association of winter sports
federations, he conducted a news conference in the company of
Samaranch. Hodler, who alleged on Saturday that agents were
offering small blocs of IOC members' votes to candidate cities for
bribes, said that ``this meeting is at the end of the three worst
days I have spent in my long period in sports, which has lasted 75
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why, he said, ``Because for a time I thought that those I
trusted most were trying to push things under the carpet and that
might put all the blame on Salt Lake City.''
</P>
<P>
   Hodler, who declined to give the names of the IOC members in
question, said he made allegations about corruption in recent
bidding processes because he did not want Salt Lake City to be the
scapegoat. He also said he was worried that the revelations would
severely hamper the Salt Lake City committee's ability to raise the
$350 million dollars it needs to round out its $1.4 billion dollar
budget. ``We should be grateful to Salt Lake City that this
evidence was found,'' Hodler said.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, however, the Salt Lake City scholarship fund and
its beneficiaries are all that Pound's commission is officially
scrutinizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have proof, we will open new dossiers, too,'' Samaranch
said.

them ``artificially low,'' according to Amaret Sila-On, chairman of
the Financial Sector Restructuring Authority.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how little money the auction raises, however,
knowledge of the prices will automatically push forward the next
stage of Thailand's recovery, according to David Fernandez, a
Singapore-based regional economist for J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   The amount paid for the loans will allow banks to estimate the
necessary level of provisions for bad loans and help break the ice
with corporate restructuring as the new creditors start talking to
the companies that owe money, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the process gets under way, I think we could see a rapid
acceleration in bank recapitalization and corporate
restructuring,'' Fernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   Walker of Credit Lyonnais, who was severely criticized by Thai
authorities last year when he correctly predicted the fall of the
baht months before it occurred, said early signs showed the Thai
economy had hit a pretty solid bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a yearly basis, the `headline' numbers are still way out of
the ballpark,'' he said, referring to the plunge in sales of cars
by 72 percent and motorcycles by 52 percent this year through
October.
</P>
<P>
   By examining shorter periods and making seasonal adjustments,
Walker reckons Thailand's economy bottomed out last March. ``If you
wait for headline figures to change, you've already missed the
recovery,'' he said. &QL;

 A DANGEROUS INVITATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Some Republicans have been saying that moderates might
vote against impeachment if only President Clinton would admit that
he lied. But it is not so simple. For the president to say that he
knowingly made false statements might well put him in greater
jeopardy of impeachment _ and in due course of criminal
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr did not use the word ``perjury'' in telling the
House of Representatives that there were 11 possible grounds for
impeaching the President. Neither did David Schippers, counsel to
the judiciary committee's impeachment inquiry, when he expanded the
list to 16.
</P>
<P>
   The committee went up a notch to perjury. Three of its four
articles of impeachment charge the president with ``perjurious''
statements: in his testimony to the grand jury, in his deposition
in the Paula Jones case and in his answers to the 81 questions put
to him by the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Perjury is defined by title 18 of the United States Code,
section 1621, as stating ``willfully'' under oath ``any material
matter'' that the person ``does not believe to be true.'' To
violate that law, then, a person must know when he testifies that
his statement is untrue, deliberately violating his oath.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said that his Jones deposition testimony was
``difficult and ambiguous and unhelpful'' _ but that he did not
believe he was lying when he said he had not had ``sexual
relations'' with Monica Lewinsky because what they did was not
within the judge's definition of ``sexual relations.'' And, he said
this week, ``I could not admit to doing something that I am quite
sure I did not do.''
</P>
<P>
   If he now said that he knew his testimony was false when he gave
it, would that lead some moderate Republicans to vote against
impeachment? He certainly cannot count on it. To my knowledge, no
moderate Republican has actually undertaken to oppose impeachment
if Clinton says he lied.
</P>
<P>
   The ultra-conservatives who are driving the impeachment process
might well use any such admission in the opposite way: to argue
that President Clinton should be impeached because he is an
admitted perjurer.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true of the other counts charging ``perjurious''
statements. Any admission by the president might intensify the
right-wing attack.
</P>
<P>
   Many criminal lawyers think the president's statements would not
support a prosecution for perjury. Two Republican and two
Democratic prosecutors told the judiciary committee that the
prospects were too dim even to launch a prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   But if the president now admitted a knowing falsehood, that
admission would probably be admissible in evidence against him if
in future he is prosecuted for perjury. And I think Kenneth Starr
will bring such a prosecution _ staying in office until after Jan.
20, 2001, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   It is often said that the president should not be above the law.
But in this case he has been, and is, under disadvantages that
would never be suffered by any ordinary citizen.
</P>
<P>
   No ordinary citizen would be hunted by a prosecutor with no
limit of time or money _ one who, after failing to find reason to
prosecute serious crimes after years of investigation, trapped him
in an attempt to conceal wrongful consensual sex.
</P>
<P>
   No ordinary citizen who is a prosecutor's target would
effectively be forced to testify to a grand jury despite the
jeopardy of self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   No ordinary citizen would then be asked 81 questions that would
put him in peril however he answered: guilty of perjury if he
admitted past lies, guilty in the denials if he denied them.
</P>
<P>
   No ordinary citizen would face an indictment that made sweeping
charges of perjury without identifying the supposedly perjurious
statements, as is the case with the impeachment articles.
</P>
<P>
   And no ordinary citizen would face a prosecution reeking of
ideological zealotry and a desire for vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Republicans can still work out a rational agreement with
the president to rebuke him for his wrongdoing without putting him
and the country to a trial in the Senate. But short of that, we can
hardly expect him to commit legal suicide.

WITNESS ACCUSES MICROSOFT OF SABOTAGE
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Princeton University computer-science expert
Monday accused the Microsoft Corp. in federal court of sabotaging a
computer program he had written to demonstrate a key point in the
government's antitrust suit against the software giant.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who is trying the case in
District Court here, became visibly angry at the idea that
Microsoft might have taken advantage of information it acquired
through the court to sabotage the government's case.
</P>
<P>
   At the Justice Department's request, the expert witness, Edward
Felten, devised a small program last spring that was able to
extricate Microsoft's Internet Explorer Web browsing software from
its Windows 98 operating system _ something Microsoft had said was
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The question is central to the case. The government contends
that Microsoft illegally tied Internet Explorer to its
industry-standard Windows operating system to stifle competition in
the market for Web browsers, used to navigate the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft asserts that its browser is not a separate product but
an integrated feature of its operating system that cannot be
removed.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying as a government witness, Felten said several
computers on which Internet Explorer had been removed with his
``prototype removal program'' worked smoothly through the summer,
even when used to visit a special Microsoft Web page for updates to
Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   But then in September, Felten testified, he gave Microsoft a
copy of the source code for his removal program as part of a
pretrial discovery request. After that, he said, ``Microsoft
modified the software'' behind the company's update Web page ``to
make it incompatible'' with computers that had been altered by his
removal program.
</P>
<P>
   At that, Jackson's eyes widened, and he leaned toward the
witness as he asked, ``Are you telling me that as part of
discovery, you gave them this code in September, whereupon it
appears that there were product changes by Microsoft?'' Felten
affirmed that, and the judge glowered at the Microsoft lawyers'
table.
</P>
<P>
   Later, outside the courtroom, Microsoft told reporters that
there was an innocent explanation: When the company put an early
beta, or test version, of its yet-to-be released Internet Explorer
5.0 on the Web site early this month, the program had been
inadvertently set up to be downloaded into a directory that
Felten's program had deleted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a change we have made to undermine the removal
program of the government,'' a Microsoft spokesman, Mark Murray,
said.
</P>
<P>
   But even beyond that incident, Microsoft had a frustrating day
in court. Felten, the most assertive, combative witness who has
taken the stand since the trial began two months ago, gave not an
inch.
</P>
<P>
   The cross-examination was so wearying and, apparently,
fruitless, that Microsoft abandoned it early Monday afternoon,
though the company had expected to continue questioning Felten into
Tuesday, at least.
</P>
<P>
   An official associated with the government's case said, ``If you
are punching away at someone, and he punches back harder every
time, why would you want to keep punching him?''
</P>
<P>
   But John Warden, Microsoft's lead lawyer, said: ``This witness
didn't really have much to say. He said 10 times that Microsoft
could have designed Windows 98 this way or that.''
</P>
<P>
   During the cross-examination of Felten, a Microsoft lawyer,
David Heiner, asserted that the witness had not really removed
Internet Explorer from Windows at all; he had simply removed the
user's access to it. ``Isn't it true,'' Heiner asked, ``that your
version of Windows is 99.9 percent as large as the Microsoft
version because you really didn't take anything out?''
</P>
<P>
   Felten said that was irrelevant: The code he left behind is used
by other programs, not just Internet Explorer, and so it made no
sense to classify it as part of Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   Heiner kept pushing Felten to identify which lines of code
belonged to Internet Explorer. Felten refused, at one point saying:
``No that's not the right characterization. It doesn't make sense
to say that just because files are used by a program, it means that
they are a part of the program.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally the judge cut Heiner off, saying: ``You're playing word
games. He's told you a dozen times'' that code can have multiple
functions. ``To continue to pursue this I don't think is
appropriate cross-examination. You are simply inviting him to make
a careless mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, Warden declared that it was the
government that had a bad day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This witness was unable, when asked, to enumerate what code
constitutes the Web browser, or Internet Explorer, that we are
alleged to have illegally tied to Windows,'' he said. ``It's now
been a year since we demanded that the government do that, and they
still have not done that.''

QWEST TO DEVELOP WINDOWS NT WITH MICROSOFT
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST) 
 (nk) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hoping to jump-start its corporate software business in Internet
and telecommunications markets, Microsoft Corp. announced Monday
that it was investing $200 million in Qwest Communications Inc.,
the Denver-based company that is building a new fiber optic
telephone network around Internet technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives said that as part of the deal, they would
license their Windows NT 4.0 server software to Qwest. For its
part, Qwest said it planned to build a complete Web-host business
around the technology, focusing on services like dedicated
electronic commerce systems, managed software services and private
networks managed and deployed by Qwest.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's Windows NT is designed for networking, but it faces
an uphill battle in the market for Internet servers, the large,
powerful computers that deliver online products like Web pages and
e-mail. That market is now dominated by versions of the Unix
operating system from Sun Microsystems Inc. and IBM.
</P>
<P>
   The $200 million investment, which was made at $45 a share, will
give Microsoft about a 1.4 percent equity in Qwest. Qwest's shares
closed Monday at $41, down $2.375, on a day when technology stocks
in general lost value; Microsoft closed at $127.9375, down $6.0625.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the investment, Qwest plans to create a new
business unit beginning in January to market Internet applications
built around the Windows NT operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an exploding market for complex Web-hosting software
and systems,'' said Joseph Nacchio, president and chief executive
of Qwest. ``We needed people who understood the applications and
the operating system, and there is no better company for that than
Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   Qwest said there would be no conflict between the Microsoft
investment and another recent alliance that Qwest announced with
Microsoft's rival in Internet server software, the Netscape
Communications Corp. In September, Qwest and Netscape formed a
broad strategic alliance, to be called Netscape Contact, to enable
consumers to manage voice mail, e-mail and fax communications
through a single site on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Nacchio said the Netscape deal focused primarily on consumers.
He called the Microsoft investment the ``broader and deeper''
alliance designed to exploit the emergence of Qwest's new
high-speed Internet communications networks.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts said the success of the new alliance would
depend on how fast Qwest could create a sales force and deploy the
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real question has to be whether Qwest's sales channels are
robust enough,'' said Michael Kleeman, a vice president and
telecommunications expert at Boston Consulting Group. ``There are a
lot of potential synergies based on the premise of integration, but
it's going to be a challenge for Microsoft. It comes down to a
question of execution.''
</P>
<P>
   Qwest said it expected the new services to generate about $150
million in revenue in the first two years, most of it in 2000, when
it was also expected to turn its first operating profit. Qwest
estimated its start-up capital costs would be about $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is locking in to Qwest's service only for the largest
corporate customers. Microsoft President Steven Ballmer said his
company was likely to pursue its own Web-host strategy, perhaps
through its MSN online service, selling services directly to small
and midsize companies.

FORGIVE THEM THEIR DEBTS, WORLD COUNCIL SAYS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By GUSTAV NIEBUHR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe _ Adding its voice to a movement that would
link the year 2000 with a biblical concept of financial relief for
the poor, the World Council of Churches called Monday for canceling
the foreign debts of impoverished nations.
</P>
<P>
   The statement on debts was adopted on the final day of the
council's assembly, a 12-day gathering at the University of
Zimbabwe that drew nearly 1,000 delegates from Protestant and
Orthodox churches around the world. The meeting declared, ``The
basic human needs and rights of individuals and communities and the
protection of the environment should take precedence over debt
repayment.''
</P>
<P>
   In adopting the statement the council has aligned itself with a
growing number of religious leaders and some secular groups who
want to tie the millennium to the ideal of a ``jubilee'' year. The
Book of Leviticus has a visionary description of such a period,
which would occur every 49th year, in which slaves would be freed,
debtors released from their obligations and land restored to its
owners.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on that theme, the statement, ``A Jubilee Call to End
the Stranglehold of Debt on Impoverished Peoples,'' cites biblical
passages to make the case that a special period of debt relief for
the poor is ``as relevant today as it was thousands of years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement is primarily addressed to the 339 member churches,
encouraging them to work for that goal, and also to the political
leaders in the major industrialized nations. Although the statement
is long and detailed in its description of the complicated problem
of international debt, it centers on concerns that poor heavily
indebted nations, whose governments borrowed freely in the 1970s
and '80s, have been forced to make drastic cuts in spending for
public health, education and other civic needs to service their
debts.
</P>
<P>
   The statement does not list countries in the category of
``severely indebted, impoverished.'' But a member of the committee
that drafted the document said discussions of the issue often cited
50 nations, 32 of them in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Although a number of religious organizations have long voiced
similar concerns about poor countries, only recently has the idea
spread of tying the call for relief to 2000.
</P>
<P>
   A major voice in the effort is the Jubilee 2000 Coalition in
London. Its director, Ann Pettifor, said in an interview that the
group was relying for support on groups like unions, doctors'
organizations and, particularly, churches, the only places, she
said, where ``one can have a discussion based on nonmarket
values.''
</P>
<P>
   Others who focus on the debt problem include the Roman Catholic
bishops and the Evangelical Church in Germany. They published a
joint statement that quoted Pope John Paul II as having said 2000
would be ``an appropriate time'' for Christians to think about
reducing or canceling the debt of poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   A searching discussions of the issue was held two months ago at
Seton Hall University in South Orange, N.J., a conference arranged
by the U.S. Catholic Conference, the social policy organization of
the American bishops, and by Vatican officials. Among the attendees
were James Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank, and Michel
Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Personal contacts through international religious institutions,
whether the Catholic Church or the World Council, have allowed
religious leaders in poor nations to communicate directly with
counterparts elsewhere. Among the speakers Seton Hall was
Archbishop Medardo Mazombwe of Lusaka, Zambia, who said his nation
owed $750 for every citizen, adults and children.
</P>
<P>
   As a measure of the issue's complexity discussions of
indebtedness lead to questions of how to relieve the debts and how
to help those governments from borrowing heavily again. The
assembly statement deals briefly and generally with the questions,
calling for public debt cancellation and for churches to work for
``ethical governance in all countries to eradicate corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marion Best of the United Church of Canada, who was involved
in drafting the statement, said canceling a country's debt ought to
include an agreement that the money saved would go to public needs.
``We need to know how the savings will be used,'' Best said.

CHINA DENIES LAWYERS TO DISSIDENTS GOING ON TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The subversion trial of one of the most prominent
dissidents trying to promote a new political party in China has
suddenly been scheduled for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The trial of the dissident, Qin Yongmin, will take place in
Wuhan, in central China, on the same day as the trial of another
prominent leader of the suppressed China Democratic Party, Wang
Youcai, in the eastern city of Hangzhou.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of both men say they have been unable to find legal
counsel because security agents have intimidated or detained
potential lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worse than it was a few years ago when Wei Jingsheng and
Wang Dan were tried,'' said Lu Siqing, director of the Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China, based in
Hong Kong. Those two famous dissidents were sentenced to long
prison terms, then later sent to exile in the United States. ``At
least they were able to have their own lawyers,'' Lu said.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two months the authorities have cracked down hard on
dozens of democracy advocates who have tried to start the new party
and promote discussion of political alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, the activists cited China's signing of a global
convention on civil and political rights, and they were emboldened
by China's new friendship with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But the Communist Party maintains an iron grip on political
activity in China. Through arrests and other actions, the
authorities have made clear that the leadership's constant talk of
``political reform'' and ``rule of law'' does not mean that
competing political groups will be allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Qin, 44, and Wang, 32, are among a small number of leaders who
have apparently been singled out for serious criminal charges. Both
are charged with ``inciting subversion of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Wang is also charged with colluding with foreign enemies of the
state _ dissidents abroad _ which makes the case more serious.
Depending on the court's determination of the gravity of the
offenses, the men could be sentenced to five years or more in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   A third longtime dissident who has promoted the new party, Xu
Wenli, 55, of Beijing, is also being held for trial but has not yet
been formally charged.
</P>
<P>
   In Hangzhou still another democracy advocate, who lives in Spain
but was arrested in China, was charged on Sunday with financially
aiding activities that endanger state security and with illegal
entry into the country, reported the Hong Kong-based information
center, which maintains contact with dissidents throughout China.
</P>
<P>
   The democracy advocate, Wang Ce, 50, who began study in the
United States in 1984 and holds a Ph.D. in political science from
the University of Hawaii, is chairman of the Alliance for a
Democratic China _ Chinese Liberal Democratic Party, an association
of dissidents living abroad. He recently lived in Spain but retains
Chinese citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly denied entry to China, Wang Ce sneaked in from Macao.
He was arrested on Nov. 2 while meeting with Wang Youcai in
Hangzhou and now will be brought to trial. His alleged offer of
money to help Wang Youcai buy a computer is part of the legal case
against both men.
</P>
<P>
   Many other people who have been associated with the new party or
have spoken out in defense of the arrested leaders have been
detained for hours or days in recent weeks.

FLORA ROBERTS, 77, PLAY AGENT WITH ASTUTE EYE FOR TALENT
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Flora Roberts, a dynamic play agent who represented
many important theater artists, died Saturday at New York Hospital.
She was 77, and lived in Manhattan and Bridgewater, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was congestive heart failure, said her associate,
Sarah Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Sondheim, Tina Howe, Alfred Uhry, Maury Yeston and
others were greatly indebted to Ms. Roberts, who encouraged them to
challenge themselves. As she said in an interview earlier this
year, ``Writers are causes.'' When she believed in someone, she
devoted herself wholeheartedly to nurturing the career of that
client.
</P>
<P>
   As Sondheim said, she was ``a protector and an idealist'' who
cared more about the work than the contract. She was not known for
her power as a negotiator but for her perspicacity in reading
scripts and in analyzing a play in production. Andre Bishop, the
artistic director of Lincoln Center Theater, said Ms. Roberts had
``a real ability to think like a producer, feel like an artist and
act like an agent.''
</P>
<P>
   A perfect personification of her first name, Ms. Roberts gave
new meaning to the word flamboyant. She was, Ms. Howe said, ``a
woman of enormous style, heart, experience, courage, intelligence _
a real original.'' As round as she was short, and fond of wearing
large red hats, Ms. Roberts was one of the most colorful people in
the American theater, bursting with energy and with a gravelly
voice that approached that of a basso profundo. She was outspoken
with her ideas and comments and thought nothing of castigating a
client if she felt that a play was worthy of improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Her greatest talent was in her instinctive reaction to fine
work, no matter where it came from. As she said, ``Fortunately, I
have a finger on the pulse.'' Years ago, Frank Loesser sent her a
composer who had written a musical that he considered very
noncommercial. She listened to the composer play one song on the
piano in her apartment, and it gave her goose bumps. The song was
``Sit Down, John,'' the musical was ``1776.'' She recommended that
the composer, Sherman Edwards, work with Peter Stone (not her
client) as a book writer. Then she guided the show to its Broadway
success.
</P>
<P>
   When she received a script of ``The Gin Game,'' she wondered who
would want to do ``a two-character play about old people,'' then
noticed a photograph on her wall of Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy
in ``The Four-Poster.'' She called Cronyn, and, buoyed by his
enthusiasm, the play quickly rolled into production. The author,
D.L. Coburn, won a Pulitzer Prize in 1977, one of many honors
awarded to Ms. Roberts' clients, including Pulitzers for ``The
Diary of Anne Frank,'' Sondheim's ``Sunday in the Park With
George'' and ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' a play that she suggested
Alfred Uhry write when he was thinking of doing a television
mini-series.
</P>
<P>
   She met Sondheim in the early 1950s when he was working on his
first show, ``Saturday Night,'' and he became her longest-running
client. From ``West Side Story'' onward, she made creative
contributions to his musicals.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, shows that Ms. Roberts represented filled
theatrical marquees: Ms. Howe's ``Pride's Crossing,'' the revivals
of ``Anne Frank'' and ``1776,'' and, carried over from the previous
season, Uhry's ``Last Night of Ballyhoo'' and the musical
``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roberts was born in the Bronx, and studied at the Manhattan
School of Music and Hunter College to become an opera singer. At
one point she sang for Arturo Toscanini. She remembered that he
said, ``Molta musica, but a small voice.'' Eventually, she became
something of a diva in real life, and switched from opera to torch
songs, which she often sang for friends.
</P>
<P>
   After graduation, she worked as an all-purpose assistant to
Kermit Bloomgarden, the producer. One day in the mid-1940s
Bloomgarden gave her a new play to read, Lillian Hellman's
``Another Part of the Forest.'' When the playwright asked what she
thought of it, she offered frank criticism. In response, Ms.
Hellman told the producer to give his assistant a raise, adding,
``She's right, and I don't think I can fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a raise,'' said Ms. Roberts, ``and she tried to fix
it.''
</P>
<P>
   That same year, Arthur Miller submitted a play (later titled
``All My Sons'') to Bloomgarden and she advised him to produce it.
Able to present only one play at a time, he chose Ms. Hellman's
instead but, with Ms. Roberts' encouragement, subsequently produced
``Death of a Salesman.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, because of her interest in playwrights, she became
an agent. One of her first clients was Ira Levin, then a television
writer. She got him an assignment adapting the Mac Hyman novel ``No
Time for Sergeants,'' first for television, then for Broadway, and
she discovered the play's star, Andy Griffith.
</P>
<P>
   Although most of her clients were writers, Ms. Roberts also
represented a few directors (Susan Stroman) and designers (Jennifer
Tipton). Frequently she had solicitations to join major talent
agencies, but she remained fiercely independent and placed great
emphasis on personal loyalty. As she said: ``I really love most of
my clients. That's a privilege when you're on your own.''
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by her sister, Janet Sovin of Berkeley, Calif.,
and her brother, David, of Huntington Station, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roberts' major passions were theater and horses. She owned a
racehorse, Allaway, and often visited Belmont Park. At the track or
on Broadway, she relied upon her experience and her assessment of
form and potential. Sometimes she just took a flier and followed
her intuition, as when she bet on a horse named ``Comedy Tonight''
because Sondheim had written a song by that name. Naturally, she
bet on the horse to show, and it did. About her other
preoccupation, she said, ``I gamble on the theater every day.''

 &HT;    Labor: Q and A with Robert Reich
 &HT;    By Wes Hills, Rob Modic and Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The Dayton Daily News interviewed former U.S.
Department of Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich about tiered wage
contracts and their impact on workers. The following is a
transcript of that interview.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Isn't it an irresistible bargain for workers with 20 to 25
years of seniority who are five to 10 years from retirement to
consent to tiered wage structures when the alternative is losing
the plant?
</P>
<P>
   Reich: Absolutely. And it's unreasonable to expect them to
sacrifice wages, benefits and job security for the sake of younger
workers whom they don't even know. Q: What choices do unions have?
</P>
<P>
   Reich: Unions in industries like the automobile industry, which
are increasingly global in scope, have limited options. They can
fight a rear-guard action against outsourcing, two-tiered wage
contracts, downsizing, and all the other consequences of
intensifying global competition, or they can work in partnership to
upgrade the skills of their members, obtain a piece of the action
in terms of pay linked to improved productivity and profitability
and also gain more participation in ownership in the company.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are you aware of good sources for tracking the numbers of
tiered contracts?
</P>
<P>
   Reich: No. It's a problem because employees need to understand
the extent to which the labor market is changing. Unions need to
understand what they're up against in terms of the trend toward
types of treatment of employees doing essentially the same work.
And the government needs to be able to develop policies that
respond to this. Without good data, everyone is handicapped. Q: We
now see data showing that the gap between union and nonunion,
blue-collar wages is narrowing and that nonunion manufacturing
workers actually earn more in some cities than their union
counterparts. Are unions in jeopardy of further decline if this
trend continues?
</P>
<P>
   Reich: Certainly, if there are little or no advantages going to
the employee from joining a labor union, then the labor union is
going to be in trouble. But be very careful about those data. In
certain locations and in certain industries the reason that
nonunion wages are higher than union wages is that employers are
trying to prevent or want to deter or discourage employees from
joining a union. So, one way of doing that is keeping wages and
benefits high. If the unions were to disappear tomorrow, it may be
that those nonunion wages and benefits might collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Recently, as bottom-tiered workers have reached majority at
their local unions, they've ousted the old leadership that
negotiated these tiers. But they remain locked into long-term
contracts. What can they do?
</P>
<P>
   Reich: If their unions negotiated in good faith on their behalf,
I don't see what recourse they have. If there was bargaining in
good faith, if they were members of the union at the time, they
presumably are obligated by the terms of those contracts. If they
weren't members of the union at the time, then it may be possible
for them to form a separate bargaining unit and negotiate a
different contract, but that would depend on the terms of the first
contract. Q: Where do you believe this trend of tiering younger
workers may be heading?
</P>
<P>
   Reich: If younger workers are relatively unskilled and in
abundant supply relative to the demand for them, their wages are
heading south. That's been the story in this country for the last
two decades. American companies, indeed all companies, regardless
of where they're headquartered, are focusing on the bottom line
like never before. Labor costs typically constitute about 70
percent of the cost of production. So you can bet that executives
are going to be looking for every possible way to reduce labor
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If tiered wage structures have preserved American jobs and
avoided inflation during our full-employment economy, aren't these
substantial benefits to our nation?
</P>
<P>
   Reich: That's probably true. But let me restate it in slightly
broader terms. Flexible wages, that is, wages that can move up and
down according to the demand for workers, tend to have two benefits
attached to them. One is they create more jobs and the second is
they tend to avoid inflationary wage pressures. The disadvantage to
such flexibility is that many people get stuck with low-paying
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Organized labor now represents less than 10 percent of
private sector workers. What hope does it have of reversing this
trend of tiered wage structures, temporary workers, and independent
contractors?
</P>
<P>
   Reich: Organized labor can attempt to fight back on several
fronts. It can refuse to enter into two-tiered labor contracts and
seek more solidarity among all employees. It can work with
governments to ensure that all laws and regulations are being
followed and that all workers who are doing essentially the same
work are treated similarly when the law calls for it. They can
organize more aggressively and seek to gain bargaining leverage
with employers. And finally they can agree to get rid of rigid job
classifications and work rules which inhibit an employer's
flexibility. But in exchange, get an employer's commitment to
maintain wages for all people doing the same job. . . . There is
not an easy answer to all of this. Anyone who thinks someone can
waive a magic wand and prevent tiering doesn't know much about the
economy or who has economic power these days. The real problem is
that too many Americans are still on a downward escalator. Even
though the ranks of the very wealthy continue to grow and, indeed,
some of America's wealthy are richer than they ever have been, it
is also the case that many of America's blue-collar workers and
pink-collar workers are still having a difficult time making ends
meet. If you have the right education and connections, you're
probably doing very well. If you don't, you aren't.

EDITORIAL: RENOUNCING A VIOLENT PALESTINIAN PAST
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, Dec. 15:
</P>
<P>
   The five-year quest for peace in the Middle East has been
characterized by long periods of frustration, but also by moments
of transformation and hope. One of those occasions unfolded Monday
in Gaza City as many of the same Palestinian leaders who had
dedicated themselves to the destruction of Israel committed
themselves instead to nonviolent methods in the pursuit of a
compromise peace.
</P>
<P>
   In the presence of President Clinton, the Palestine National
Council formally revoked passages of its charter that called for
the violent elimination of Israel. These old oaths of enmity
understandably unnerved Israelis and undermined their trust in
Palestinian promises to abandon and combat terrorism. Israel's
Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who had personally led the
struggle for an unambiguous repudiation of the offending clauses,
promptly and properly acknowledged the Palestinian decision.
</P>
<P>
   In his own words and deeds Monday, Clinton walked a narrow but
careful line. He emphasized the political advances the Palestinians
have already made under the Oslo peace accords, without quite
treating the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, as a full-fledged
head of state. Noting that he was ``the first American president to
address the Palestinian people in a city governed by
Palestinians,'' Clinton described the economic benefits that would
flow from this fall's Maryland peace agreement, including American
aid and the opening of the new Gaza airport.
</P>
<P>
   No one imagines that further progress will be easy. Israeli
troop withdrawals scheduled for this Friday were still unsettled
Monday. The uncertainties of Israeli politics, the violence of
recent Palestinian demonstrations and the occasionally overheated
rhetoric of Israeli and Palestinian political leaders all
complicate the peace effort. But if the unambiguous commitment to
peaceful methods reflected in Monday's speeches and actions is
faithfully maintained by the Palestinians, Israelis will feel far
more comfortable about proceeding with the Oslo agreements.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the House vote on impeachment drew closer, the
ranks of Republicans supporting President Clinton's impeachment
grew Monday and, in a more ominous sign for the White House, some
of the few Republicans who have been on the record against the
impeachment drive began to waver.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican votes for impeachment continued to solidify
despite a remarkable stability in public opinion. Sixty-four
percent of Americans, including a majority of independent voters,
said they did not want their own representative to vote for
impeachment, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll
conducted Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that while most voters do not dispute the
accusations of perjury, obstruction of justice and abuse of power
outlined in the articles of impeachment approved by the House
Judiciary Committee, only 24 percent want the House to actually
vote to impeach Clinton. Another 37 percent of Americans want
Congress and Clinton to work out a compromise; 37 percent want the
matter dropped entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to escape questions about the fate of his Presidency as
he continued a Middle East peace-making mission, Clinton said that
he was open to ``any reasonable compromise'' short of impeachment.
``I don't believe it's in the interest of the United States and the
American people to go through the impeachment process and have a
trial in the Senate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But with the White House increasingly pessimistic about the
President's ability to win the vote in the House, Vice President Al
Gore was anything but conciliatory. He denounced House Republican
leaders for refusing to allow a vote to censure the president and
accused them of ignoring the ``wisdom of the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's sharp-edged comments came at the end of an otherwise
routine White House announcement on a new round of law enforcement
grants. ``It's very unfortunate that the leadership of the House of
Representatives has made a decision to reject compromise and force
a vote only on impeachment, and not give the members of Congress a
chance to vote their conscience,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   His tone was echoed by the White House press secretary, Joe
Lockhart, who said, ``There is a small group of the Republican
leadership who have made it their mission in life to remove the
president against perhaps the will of the House but certainly
against the will of the American public.''
</P>
<P>
   He also raised the specter that a Senate trial could undermine
the economy. ``I'd say that any student of the markets will say
that uncertainty is bad for the markets,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing that a direct campaign to lobby Republicans would be
counterproductive at this point, the White House and its allies
focused many of their efforts on trying to energize the public and
stoke a backlash against impeachment. John J. Sweeney, president of
the AFL-CIO, instructed union members to use a toll free line to
call the Capitol and press Republicans for a censure vote. He also
urged union locals within 100 miles of Washington to wage a mass
demonstration and vigil on the steps of the Capitol when the
impeachment debate begins Thursday, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson
called for a prayer vigil.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effort to impeach President Clinton has moved beyond
reason or responsibility,'' he said in a letter to union
presidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``People for the American Way,'' a liberal advocacy group, said
it would broadcast 30-second radio spots Tuesday evening urging
Americans to use a toll-free line to call Capitol Hill. The ad
features a couple locked in conversation about impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country's going to be paralyzed,'' a woman says. ``And you
know who is going to suffer?'' Her companion answers: ``We will.''
</P>
<P>
   Capitol offices were already deluged Monday with phone calls,
e-mails and telegrams. The phone traffic was so heavy that callers
to House offices often received an electronic message: ``All
circuits are busy. Please try your call again later.''
</P>
<P>
   And some Clinton allies did try personal appeals. The actor
Robert DeNiro made calls against impeachment Monday to at least two
New York Republicans _ Reps. James Walsh of Syracuse and Sherwood
Boehlert of Utica. Neither congressman returned his calls, and
Walsh had already declared for impeachment this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee sought to stiffen
the resolve of members. They drafted a set of talking points for
Republicans on the committee to use in explaining the committee's
votes for four articles of impeachment. It struck three main
points: that ``the evidence is overwhelming;'' that ``our laws
should apply equally to every American,'' and that ``America and
the Constitution are strong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the height of egotism to suggest that the president's
well-being and the well-being of the country are the same,'' said
one of the talking points.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans appeared to be moving steadily toward impeachment.
Rep. Christopher Shays, who was one of the first Republicans to
speak out against impeachment, softened his position Monday on the
eve of a town meeting in his Connecticut district.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the vote were today, I'd be voting against,'' Shays said.
``But it is not the same kind of certainty I had a week ago. My
certainty has been shaken by the president's failure to come to
grips with his problem.'' He was particularly critical of Clinton's
statement of contrition last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just dug a deeper a hole,'' Shays said. ``I think he needs
to say he did not tell the truth. And he did not. Like all
Americans, he must abide by the laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Shays said he wanted to meet with the President before he casts
his vote. The White House was so alarmed that John Podesta, the
White House chief of staff, called Shays to arrange the meeting
immediately after reading his remarks on a new wire.
</P>
<P>
   One other in the handful of Republicans who have expressed
opposition to impeachment also signaled a possible change of heart.
Aides to Rep. Jack Quinn, a Republican from outside Buffalo, said
he was now undecided.
</P>
<P>
   In the lame-duck 105th Congress, Republicans hold 228 seats. The
Democrats have 206, and there is one independent who usually votes
with the Democrats. Democratic leaders are hoping to hold all but
three to five Democrats against impeachment. That means Clinton
must win support from 14 to 16 Republicans to prevail by just one
vote.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to see how he can reach that number, with only Reps.
Amo Houghton and Peter T. King, both of New York, and Mark Edward
Souder of Indiana still solidly against impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The pool of undecided Republicans shrank Monday, when Reps.
Wayne T. Gilchrest of Maryland, Frank A. LoBiondo of New Jersey,
Charles Bass of New Hampshire and Zach Wamp of Tennessee, all
declared their alignment with the majority for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans were picking and choosing among the articles of
impeachment. Wamp said he would support the articles accusing
Clinton of perjury before a grand jury and of obstruction of
justice, but said he was still weighing the other two articles of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, who were still searching for converts to the
President's cause, said that most of the Republicans who declared
their positions Monday had never been considered likely to support
him. A senior Democratic leadership aide said, ``It's going to come
down to three or four votes but it's still doable.''
</P>
<P>
   The battle for votes is expected to intensify over the next few
days. The House begins consideration of the president's impeachment
on Thursday and the leaders of the two parties were still
negotiating over the time to be allowed for debate. Republicans
were offering six to eight hours and Democrats _ still looking at
parliamentary maneuvers to force a vote on censure _ were seeking
as much as two days.
</P>
<P>
   But even before the critical vote, there were signs that much of
Washington was turning its attention to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In an op-ed article in The New York Times on Tuesday, Bob Dole,
Clinton's Republican Opponent in the 1996 presidential race, urges
the Senate _ whether or not impeachment is approved by the House _
to pass a tough censure measure that Clinton would have to sign. He
suggests that all Congressional action should be complete by Jan.
2.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert G. Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat, said that the
Senate would be operating in ``a legal twilight zone'' with only
one precedent, the trial of Andrew Johnson 130 years ago. He
suggested the Senate could choose to toss out the impeachment case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the first judgment to be made in the United States
Senate is whether a motion will be entertained to dismiss the
impeachment resolution passed by the House of Representatives,'' he
said. ``It would be the legal equivalent of a motion to dismiss.''

A. LEON HIGGINBOTHAM JR., PROMINENT BLACK JUDGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A. Leon Higginbotham Jr., who called himself ``a survivor of
segregation'' and became one of the country's most prominent
African-American judges, died Monday in Boston. He was 70 and died
after a stroke for which he had been hospitalized on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Higginbotham, a legal scholar, author and historian, was an
influential federal judge for 29 years until he retired in 1993. He
often used the story of his own life, which began in an era of
discrimination in Trenton, N.J., as an example of how what he
called voiceless and forgotten people could overcome obstacles if
they had help.
</P>
<P>
   From 1990 until his retirement, Higginbotham was chief judge of
the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia. He was only
the third black jurist to have directed one of the country's
federal appeals panels, which are second in importance only to the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Some historians say Higginbotham was one of a handful of black
jurists President Johnson considered as candidates to integrate the
Supreme Court before he named Thurgood Marshall the first black
justice in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   In a career of energetic accomplishment and unambiguous
liberalism, Higginbotham received much recognition as a legal
scholar and civil rights advocate, including the nation's highest
civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   He persistently said that many of the advances for black
Americans that he had applauded over a long legal career were
endangered by cutbacks in affirmative action and reduced
opportunities for black lawyers and judges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I witnessed the birth of racial justice in the Supreme Court
and here now, after 45 years as a lawyer, judge and law professor,
I sometimes feel as if I am watching justice die,'' he wrote in an
article in The New York Times Magazine in January.
</P>
<P>
   After his retirement from the bench he taught at Harvard
University, practiced law in New York and Washington and served on
corporate boards, including that of The New York Times Co.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 he published ``Shades of Freedom'' (Oxford University
Press), the second of four books he planned to write on the law and
race. His earlier book, ``In the Matter of Color,'' published in
1978, dealt with the evolution of legal and racial attitudes in the
era of slavery. At the time of his death, he was at work on an
autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Ogletree Jr., a friend and fellow professor at Harvard,
said Monday that Higginbotham would be remembered most as an
influential legal thinker who championed affirmative action and
civil rights. ``Once he succeeded,'' Ogletree said, ``he was one
who didn't hesitate to let the rope drop back down and help others
who needed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Only days before his death, Higginbotham was still influencing
the issues of the day. On Dec. 1, he testified before the House
Judiciary Committee's impeachment inquiry. He joined other legal
experts in expressing the view that there were no grounds for
impeachment of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   He testified that even if Clinton had committed perjury, not all
perjurious statements were equal under the law. He suggested that
Clinton's misstatements about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky
were more like lies to avoid a speeding ticket than like lies about
selling the nation's security secrets to a foreign enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Higginbotham often took strong positions. In recent years he was
one of the most bitter public critics of Supreme Court Justice
Clarence Thomas, saying that Thomas' conservative opinions had
injured black Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, after Thomas addressed a group of black lawyers and
judges, Higginbotham said he did not deserve the honor of being
keynote speaker because his rulings ``have done more to turn back
the clock of racial progress than any other African-American public
official in the history of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Higginbotham often cast his commitment to the law as a
commitment to social justice. He said it had come from hard
experience. In emotional speeches, the judge, who was a commanding
6 feet 5 inches tall, described how a white college president at
Purdue University had flatly told him when he was a college
freshman in 1944 that the school was not required under the law to
provide black students with heated dormitories and, therefore,
never would.
</P>
<P>
   He said that experience had persuaded him to become a lawyer,
because he did not believe that the law should sanction such
injustices. But even as an award-winning graduate from Yale Law
School in 1952, he said, he could not escape the sting of bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   When he accepted an invitation for an interview at one of the
premier Philadelphia law firms after law school, he said, a
secretary seemed puzzled when he arrived. He soon realized that the
firm's lawyers had assumed that the Yale student named Leon
Higginbotham was white. The interviewing lawyer told him his resume
was impressive. But then he added: ``Of course, you know there's
nothing I can do for you,'' Higginbotham said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By the time he reached the lobby of the law firm's building, he
told a group of Yale Law School alumni years later, he was in
tears. Ernest Rubenstein, a New York lawyer and Yale classmate who
was in that crowd in 1989 when Higginbotham described that
experience, said Monday that there were few dry eyes in the
audience.
</P>
<P>
   But the speech, Rubenstein said, also included ample
descriptions of teachers who had encouraged the young black
scholar, and of the struggling parents who had insisted that he be
given the chance to rise out of their troubled neighborhood in
Trenton. ``I think he understood,'' Rubenstein said, ``no one ever
does it alone.''
</P>
<P>
   In the account of his life that Higginbotham gave to audiences,
he told of his journey from the segregated Trenton schools to his
days as an assistant district attorney in Philadelphia and then as
a partner in a black law firm. He was president of the Philadelphia
chapter of the NAACP from 1960 to 1962.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, at age 36, President Kennedy named him to the U.S.
District Court in Philadelphia. In 1977, President Carter elevated
him to the court of appeals. When Judge John Gibbons, the only
judge who was his senior on the bench, stepped down in 1989,
Higginbotham automatically moved up to the chief judge's position.
The other two black jurists who had held similar posts were William
Hastie and Spottswood Robinson III.
</P>
<P>
   When he spoke to young people, Higginbotham sometimes dwelled
more on the opportunities for continued progress than on the
problems he had seen in a long career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will make two requests of you,'' he said to graduating
seniors at Wesleyan University in 1996. ``They are that you always
attempt to see those human beings who become invisible to most
people, and that you always try to hear the pleas of those persons
who, despite their pain and suffering, have become voiceless and
forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Higginbotham is survived by his wife, Evelyn Brooks
Higginbotham, a professor of history and Afro-American studies at
Harvard, two sons, Stephen and Kenneth of Philadelphia, and two
daughters, Karen of Denver and Nia, a college student in
Massachusetts. His first marriage, to Jeanne Higginbotham, ended in
divorce in 1988.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, called on some of Wall Street's leaders in the summer
of 1994 with a warning.
</P>
<P>
   Congress was asking pointed questions about whether complex
financial contracts called derivatives could topple a major
financial institution or even threaten the financial system. Wall
Street, he said, should do something. It did.
</P>
<P>
   The following spring, six of the biggest Wall Street investment
firms released a plan to tighten their own controls of derivatives
while giving regulators greater access to their records. The firms,
it was argued, knew best how to manage their own risky world of
finance and might even create a model of self-regulation.
</P>
<P>
   But the weaknesses of that system were exposed in September when
Long-Term Capital Management, the giant hedge fund with big bets in
the derivatives market, careered toward collapse, threatening to
ignite a global financial panic. Fourteen firms, including all six
of those that had favored self regulation, eventually agreed to
rescue Long-Term Capital in an extraordinary deal brokered by the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion that one fund's misstep could harbor such dire
consequences has Congress reconsidering how to oversee the booming
derivatives market.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every previous instance of derivative problems, the
industry and the regulators said do nothing,'' Rep. Edward J.
Markey, D-Mass., a member of the House Banking Committee, said in
an interview. ``But now we see that industry risk management
controls were lacking.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress has asked a presidential working group _ with
representatives from the Federal Reserve Board, the U.S. Treasury,
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission _ to deliver a study in the coming year on the
derivatives market and another on the public policy implications of
the near collapse of Long-Term Capital. Members of the working
group will give a progress report to the Senate Agriculture
Committee on Wednesday. Former Fed officials and regulators will
also testify before the committee, one of several looking into the
near collapse of Long-Term Capital.
</P>
<P>
   Though congressmen and regulators have not yet lined up behind
specific proposals, the debate over additional regulation is
spreading beyond just hedge funds and focusing on three broad
areas:
</P>
<P>
   _ New disclosure requirements for hedge funds, which are largely
unregulated, and derivatives dealers. These groups might have to
reveal their closely guarded trading positions and their risk
levels frequently to regulators. The idea has support from much of
the financial industry, which says it would at least provide a
window on the amount of hedging and the amount of speculating in
the market.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some limit on how much commercial and investment banks can
lend to hedge funds like Long-Term Capital or new disclosure on
that lending. For example, securities regulators might decide to
monitor hedge funds weekly or monthly, rather than rely on the
quarterly filings now made to the futures commission.
</P>
<P>
   _ The creation of a clearing house, much like a stock exchange,
for the trading of derivatives that do not now have an exchange. A
clearing house could hold both parties accountable and step in to
complete transactions if one party was unable to cover its losses,
reducing the chance that a big default would trigger a series of
defaults.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, brokerage firms now patrol their own risks,
and bank regulators tend to focus on overall risk management
practices, though they may look at industry sectors or even
specific loans if they have a special concern. Hedge funds, which
are investment pools open only to wealthy investors, are largely
unregulated.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts at additional oversight will face stiff opposition from
financial industry officials, who consider more regulation costly
and cumbersome _ possibly stifling the smooth functioning of the
derivatives markets. Derivatives, so called because their value is
derived from an underlying asset like a stock or a bond, allow
companies and individuals to manage many types of risk, like a
sudden fluctuation in a currency or an interest rate, throughout
the global marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Even government regulators are torn over how and whether to
tighten rules on derivatives. In Washington, officials at the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission are in a pitched battle with
the Treasury, the Fed and the SEC over which agency has
jurisdiction and whether any further regulation is needed.
</P>
<P>
   The derivatives market has faced down oversight before. In late
1994, Orange County, Calif., made headlines by declaring bankruptcy
after suffering more than $1.6 billion in derivatives-related
losses. And the next year, Barings PLC, Britain's oldest investment
bank, collapsed after a 27-year-old trader struck out in the
derivatives market.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, after studies and consideration, regulators
backed down from wholesale regulation for fear of impeding the
market's growth. Instead, they have made incremental changes in the
way banks and brokerage firms _ the major dealers in the
derivatives market _ handle transactions and support industry
efforts at self regulation.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Regulators in other countries are wrestling with the problem as
well. Last July, Swiss regulators criticized Europe's biggest bank,
the Union Bank of Switzerland, for weaknesses in its management of
derivative risks. Three months later, UBS said it would take a $700
million loss on its business with Long-Term Capital. Since then,
Dresdner Bank of Germany and Credit Suisse First Boston have also
taken big hits because of Long-Term Capital.
</P>
<P>
   These missteps from some of the world's most prestigious
financial institutions point to another concern: The giant
derivatives market rests on about a dozen global financial
institutions, which account for more than half of all derivatives
business, according to Swaps Monitor, an industry publication. That
concentration troubles some financial experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have huge risks building up on the shoulders of these few
huge financial institutions that dominate this market'' said Henry
T.C. Hu, a derivatives expert and professor at the University of
Texas Law School. ``That's a Herculean task and one that I worry
about a little more now that Long-Term Capital almost collapsed.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Long-Term Capital is considered unusual in the size of
its bets, the extensive amount it borrowed and the number of
markets it entered, there is nothing to prevent other investors
from getting into similar predicaments.
</P>
<P>
   A report by the International Monetary Fund suggests more
problems are lurking. In its annual survey of international capital
markets, released this fall, the IMF referred to ``ticking time
bombs'' buried in losing derivative trades by financial
institutions in emerging markets like Asia _ time bombs that could
shake government officials out of their regulatory slumber.
</P>
<P>
   Derivatives contracts have exploded in the last 10 years as a
way for corporations, local governments and others looking to
manage risks in the global marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   An American company doing business in Japan, for example, might
buy an option on the Japanese yen to protect itself against a
decline in the currency that could hurt its profits, posted in
American dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Many derivatives are standardized contracts, like the foreign
currency contract described here. These contracts, called
``plain-vanilla'' derivatives, trade on a financial exchange that
is regulated. But many other derivatives contracts are tailored for
specific parties, like an interest rate swap, in which one party
agrees to exchange a fixed interest rate for a floating rate with a
second party for a specified period. Such private business
contracts are traded over the counter and remain off banks' balance
sheets. It is this second type of derivative that is the most
vexing for regulators since trading is conducted behind closed
doors and largely unregulated.
</P>
<P>
   Derivatives of both types have grown, though they are measured
in different ways, making direct comparisons difficult. For the
contracts not traded on an exchange, the prime measure is notional
value, or the amount of the underlying asset on which they are
based. About $37 trillion in such contracts are now out, up from
$865 billion in 1987, according to the International Swap and
Derivatives Association.
</P>
<P>
   As this market has grown, so has concern about whether banks,
brokerage firms and derivatives dealers could be brought down by a
market mishap, a big bet turned sour or a rogue trader at another
institution. In 1993, the House Banking Committee issued a 900-page
report on the derivatives market, which one congressman called the
``new wild card in international finance,'' presaging the jitters
over Orange County, Barings and Long-Term Capital.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office released a study the next year
that identified a number of risks to the system and to individual
firms; it led to more internal controls by firms. Partly because of
Levitt's prodding, the Wall Street firms agreed to train their top
managers and board members on derivative risks, enhance their
reporting to the SEC and the CFTC, take derivatives into account
when setting aside capital, and follow certain guidelines when
dealing with people who are not finance professionals.
</P>
<P>
   A drumbeat for greater disclosure is now being sounded by
prominent Wall Street figures and hedge fund managers such as
George Soros, Julian H. Robertson Jr. of Tiger Management,
Citigroup Chairman Sanford I. Weill and Goldman, Sachs co-chairman
Jon Corzine.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators and the financial markets could, the thinking goes,
operate much better with more information. Bank regulators already
have access to information about derivatives risk; in fact, they
often set up shop inside big banks. Brokerage firms voluntarily
provide quarterly reports on the risks associated with derivatives.
The question remains, though, whether regulators receive
information on a timely basis and whether they need information on
hedge funds.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Brooksley E. Born, chairwoman of the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, says that secrecy in the derivatives market is
worrisome. ``There has been a great deal of concern internationally
about the lack of transparency,'' she said in an interview. ``I
share that concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Creating a more open market, however, is fraught with
difficulty. The value of derivatives contracts changes rapidly,
making information out of date as soon as it is gathered. And what
exactly would derivatives dealers and hedge funds disclose, since
others could use that information for market gains, and whom would
they disclose it to? Regulators? Investors? Creditors?
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is to restrict how much regulated financial
institutions can lend or require hedge funds to put up more
collateral, in effect putting a brake on easy lending, which some
industry officials argue is the crux of the matter. ``What was
wrong with Long-Term Capital wasn't derivatives, it was
borrowing,'' said Thomas Clark, a managing director in the
derivatives area for J.P. Morgan. ``This is all about leverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term Capital had borrowed assets equal to 25 times its
capital at the end of last year, making it look more like a
securities firm than the typical hedge fund. As Long-Term Capital
coughed up additional money to satisfy its lending agreements, its
borrowed assets rose to 100 times its dwindling capital.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, and others suggest that new rules
may be needed to protect against a national banking crisis since
hedge funds are often supported by federally insured banks. ``It
would be imprudent and anti-intellectual not to seriously review
the derivatives and hedge fund industries,'' Leach, chairman of the
House Banking Committee, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of such proposals say that government interference would
only impede business. ``The problem in the derivatives market is
that it's hard to figure out what something's worth,'' said Michael
Segal, president of Lamborn Securities, a derivatives dealer in New
York. ``You can't come up with a standard measurement to put
restrictions on leverage. This is not the place for government.''
</P>
<P>
   A third proposal is the use of a private clearinghouse to settle
the many derivatives trades that are not now handled on any
exchange. The change would be much like that in the market for
small stocks, which once traded over the counter before Nasdaq came
along to standardize trading.
</P>
<P>
   A clearinghouse, for a fee, would match trades and guarantee
that all transactions are honored, even if one party goes bankrupt
before making good on its contract. It could also be used to impose
controls on borrowing. The clearinghouse proposal has received a
great deal of attention and was recommended by the Bank for
International Settlements, which coordinates global banking rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been talked about for a long time,'' said Leslie Rahl, a
principal with Capital Markets Risk Advisers, a New York consulting
firm specializing in derivatives. But the idea ``hasn't gone
anywhere because of dealer resistance _ the costs and the
complexities in agreeing on what something can be valued at.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether a clearinghouse could stave off huge losses amid severe
market turmoil is hard to determine. ``A domino effect will bring
down a clearing operation, too,'' said Franklin Edwards, a
professor of economics and finance at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the proposals being forwarded, many regulators and
financial experts worry that creating more regulatory hurdles could
disrupt or stifle a vibrant and vital marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very easy to call for regulation, but one needs to assess
whether it's going to do any good,'' said Susan Phillips, dean of
the school of business and management at George Washington
University and until recently a member of the Federal Reserve
Board. ``Every time someone talks about a new regulatory scheme it
adds costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Phillips and a host of regulators have long opposed tighter
controls on derivatives that are traded over the counter. Many of
them, including the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, believe
that the market can be more effectively regulated through banks and
brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aside from safety and soundness regulation of derivatives
dealers under the banking or securities laws, regulation of
derivatives transactions that are privately negotiated by
professionals is unnecessary,'' Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan told
the House Banking Committee this summer before the Long-Term
Capital rescue.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the banks argue that their examiners already
scrutinize derivatives activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every swap contract at every bank is regulated,'' said Mark
Brickell, a board member of the International Swaps and Derivatives
Association and a managing director at J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   That leads some industry observers to conclude that it was not
the absence of controls but a regulatory failure that brought
Long-Term Capital to the brink and threatened its business
partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to, do you think the regulation of banks is
sufficient?'' Edwards, of Columbia University, said. ``If the links
in the chain are strong, the chain won't break. But the fact is,
it's very difficult for regulators to see what's going on; this
market is too complex, too opaque and too fast moving.''

   William D. Denson, who helped to convict and execute more Nazi
war criminals than any other American while serving as the chief
military prosecutor of those accused of administering concentration
camps in Germany, died on Sunday at his home in Lawrence, N.Y. He
was 85.
</P>
<P>
   In four trials conducted from 1945 to 1947, which focused on
atrocities committed at the concentration camps at Dachau,
Mauthausen, Buchenwald and Flossenburg, Denson prosecuted 177
Nazis, among them Ilse Koch, the sadistic wife of the camp
commandant who came to be known as ``The Bitch of Buchenwald,'' and
August Eigruber, a fanatical Nazi Gauleiter in Austria who shouted
``Heil Hitler'' as the noose was placed around his neck.
</P>
<P>
   Most defendants Denson was in charge of prosecuting in 1945 were
much closer to the scenes of the Nazi crimes than those in the dock
in the more famous 1945-46 trials at Nuremberg. Many Nuremberg
defendants had planned the brutal acts, but the underlings who
carried them out drew harsher penalties, in many cases. Of those
Denson prosecuted, four were acquitted and 132 were sentenced to
death, with the rest receiving prison terms. Of those condemned to
die, some had their sentences reduced on appeal, but 97 were
eventually hanged.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, of the 22 most prominent former Nazis who were
the first to go on trial in Nuremberg, 12 received death sentences
and three were sentenced to life in prison, while four were granted
lesser prison terms and three were acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   In the trials that Denson oversaw, proceedings were conducted in
Dachau and were presided over by American judges under the U.S. War
Crimes Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the trials, Denson was a 32-year-old West Point
graduate and a lawyer assigned to the Judge Advocate's Office in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   He had seen war, destruction and suffering, and yet, as he
remarked in an interview in 1990, what he heard as he began to
gather testimony aroused disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be perfectly candid with you,'' said Denson, who was by
then an elderly man, ``I thought here were some people who had been
mistreated in the concentration camps and they were seeking
revenge, and that they were really doing a job drawing on fantasy
rather than reality. And when I questioned a number of witnesses,
and they related substantially the same things, then I knew the
events had occurred, because these witnesses did not have a chance
to get together ahead of time and fabricate their stories.''
</P>
<P>
   He said those who were convicted seemed to have had normal
backgrounds, but the more violence and mistreatment they were
exposed to, ``the more unconscionable these people became.'' He
added, ``They showed no remorse, none that I saw.''
</P>
<P>
   The most controversial of the cases was that of Ilse Koch. The,
woman, then 40 years old, was accused of singling out inmates for
beatings and torture that at times brought on their deaths. She was
also accused of possessing lampshades and a photo album made of
tattooed skin.
</P>
<P>
   Because Mrs. Koch was pregnant when brought to trial, Denson
sought and obtained a sentence of life in prison, rather than the
death penalty, for her crimes against non-Germans. But a year
later, Gen. Lucius Clay, the senior U.S. military official in
Germany, commuted her term to four years.
</P>
<P>
   Denson, by then a civilian, called Clay's decision ``a mockery
of the administration of justice.'' But Mrs. Koch was then tried by
a German court for her role in the deaths of German citizens, and
drew another life term in a German prison, where she committed
suicide in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, Denson returned to the United States, joining the
Atomic Energy Commission as chief of litigation. He represented the
commission at the spying trial of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. In
195O, he married Constance von Francken-Sierstorpff, the daughter
of a princely family he had met in Germany while serving as
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Denson is survived by his daughters,
Yvonne McQuilkin of Cambridge, Mass., and Olivia Fischett of
Parsippany, N.J.; a son, William Denson Jr. of Lawrence, N.Y., and
five grandchildren.

EDITORIAL: THE HIGH PRICE OF THE PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, Dec. 15:
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut Legislature plans to vote Tuesday on a deal that
would bring the New England Patriots to Hartford in 2001. The team
comes with a considerable price tag. The state is promising to
build a $375 million downtown stadium and a $15 million practice
field, which the Patriots will occupy rent-free for 30 years. In
addition, taxpayers will subsidize millionaire owner Robert Kraft
up to $13 million a year if the Patriots fail to sell a certain
number of luxury boxes and club seats.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing out the downside of this plan seems almost fruitless,
since the deal has about as much chance of being defeated as the
Patriots do of winning the Super Bowl. Connecticut may call itself
``the land of steady habits,'' but the excitement over bringing NFL
football to Hartford seems to have won over all but the crankiest
of its politicians.
</P>
<P>
   For a state with the highest per capita debt in the nation to
borrow money to woo a team that will play only 10 games a year at
home, including the preseason schedule, seems like a particularly
dubious form of corporate welfare. But the deal does have some
practical benefits. The stadium will also be home to the University
of Connecticut football team, which needs a new facility. It will
be situated in an area that was already targeted for economic
development, and Kraft has promised to invest $70 million in a
hotel and entertainment center there. Hartford is certainly in need
of a psychic and economic boost, and Gov. John Rowland has a point
when he constantly asks if anyone else has a better idea of how to
bring it about.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is no good reason to commit public money to
guarantee that Kraft can rent his premium seats at his price.
Cities and states continually attempt to lure new businesses by
offering tax breaks, infrastructure improvements or even new
buildings. But subsidizing sale of the product itself is taking the
bidding war too far.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to clinch the deal with Connecticut, the Patriots
agreed last weekend to reduce the subsidy guarantee from $17.5
million to $13 million a year and to cut the price of the club
seats to make them more attractive. Kraft says demand will be so
great there will be no danger of actually requiring the state to
chip in. But if the Patriots management was really sure of its
sales, he would not have demanded the guarantee in the first place,
or hung onto it so stubbornly.
</P>
<P>
   There is no excuse for promising that the taxpayers will rent
out $100,000-a-year luxury boxes if no one else is willing to buy
them. Even in an age where sports owners expect the benefits of
one-way Socialism, there have to be limits.

HERNANDEZ WILL RETIRE NEXT YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Former two-time world champion Genaro Hernandez,
32, said he will formally announce his retirement early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, who has been boxing professionally for 14 years, said
tests revealed ``a trace of blood'' on his brain after the bout in
which he lost the WBC super featherweight title to Floyd Mayweather
on Oct. 3.
</P>
<P>
   That, combined with waning enthusiasm for the sport, led to his
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone or something is telling me, `You should stop,' '' said
Hernandez, who grew up in South Central Los Angeles. ``I don't want
to take any more chances. I've fought 14 years, won two world
titles. That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez defeated Daniel Londas to win the WBA 130-pound title
in 1991 and successfully defended it eight times over four years.
He outpointed the great Azumah Nelson in March of last year to win
the WBC version of the championship, perhaps his greatest
achievement in boxing.

JUDGE FREES PALESTINIAN WHO REFUSED TO TESTIFY 
</HEADLINE>
 RELEASED-NYT  (rl) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Palestinian man jailed for eight months after he
refused to testify before a federal grand jury investigating
terrorism was ordered freed Monday by a judge who concluded that
further imprisonment would not change the man's mind.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was the second in four months in which a federal
judge in Manhattan released a Palestinian imprisoned on charges of
contempt of the grand jury, which has been conducting a two-year
investigation into ``an international scheme to launder money in
support of murder and kidnapping,'' prosecutors said in legal
papers.
</P>
<P>
   The rulings have come amid a widening investigation by federal
prosecutors in New York into worldwide terrorism, and it was
unclear how much of a setback the rulings represent.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Michael Mukasey left little doubt that he believed the
witness, Ismail Elbarasse of Virginia, had been involved in
fund-raising for terrorism. He noted that prosecutors could now
bring criminal contempt charges against Elbarasse and the other
Palestinian, Abdelhaleem Ashqar, for their refusals to testify.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Mukasey cited government assertions in court papers that
Elbarasse is ``a Hamas operative'' and other evidence that he
shared a bank account with Mohammed Abu Marzook, the Hamas
political leader jailed in New York during an extradition battle
with Israel before he was released to Jordan last year.
</P>
<P>
   But Mukasey said Elbarasse's close association with Marzook
suggested that he was probably not ``an untested neophyte'' and
therefore was unlikely to agree to testify during the 18-month
period in which he could be jailed on the civil contempt order.
</P>
<P>
   When Elbarasse appeared before the grand jury last April, he
cited political and religious reasons for refusing to testify, ``no
matter what my punishment may be, no matter how long my sentence.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Elbarasse and Ashqar, who went on a hunger strike before he
was freed in August by another judge, were offered immunity from
prosecution in return for their testimony, but each man refused to
answer prosecutors' questions.
</P>
<P>
   Elbarasse's lawyer, Stanley Cohen, who also represented Marzook
in his extradition fight, welcomed the release of Elbarasse, but
sharply criticized the judge's suggestion that both of his clients
had links to terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   He called Elbarasse ``a Palestinian hero'' whose ``only crime is
to have the temerity and the principle to stand against the power
of the U.S. government in its unbridled attack upon the Palestinian
people.''

ANDREW LLOYD WEBBER'S LATEST AUDIENCE: A JURY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Andrew Lloyd Webber sat at a piano in federal court
in Manhattan on Monday and played part of a song that another
composer swears he wrote first.
</P>
<P>
   The impromptu recital for a nine-member jury, several lawyers
and a few reporters is likely to be the finale of an 8-year-old
copyright infringement lawsuit brought against Lloyd Webber by Ray
Repp, a composer.
</P>
<P>
   The suit alleges that Lloyd Webber stole a short passage from a
song by Repp, ``Till You'' (1978), and recast it as the central
theme of the musical ``Phantom of the Opera.'' Lloyd Webber has
strenuously denied the charges, and took to the stand _ and the
piano _ to prove his case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have just always loved these chords,'' he said, playing
several snippets from the main theme of ``Phantom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And so it started like that,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Repp's lawyers, however, insisted that Lloyd Webber had lifted
the melody of their client's song and reworked the tune into his
musical, which has been playing in New York since 1988 and has
grossed more than $1 billion worldwide. The suit seeks part of the
musical's royalties, a figure that could quickly run into the
millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proof is in the music itself,'' said William Coulson, a
lawyer for Repp. ``Just listen.''
</P>
<P>
   And so the jury did, listening to recorded passages of music
from several of Lloyd Webber's musicals, while the composer, in the
stand, looked slightly embarrassed. During cross-examination, the
jury also received something of a primer in Lloyd Webber's career
and accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been very lucky,'' he said as he told about his many Tony
Awards. ``And as much as I hate to say it, I have been knighted by
the Queen.''
</P>
<P>
   Repp has been less fortunate. A composer of religious folk
music, he says he created ``Till You'' in 1976 while strumming his
guitar. He later added lyrics inspired by the Gospel of St. Luke,
and recorded and copyrighted the song in 1978. Its gross sales,
through 1996, were $75.87.
</P>
<P>
   Repp claims that in 1989, he received a compact disk of
``Phantom of the Opera'' and was struck by the similarity between
several bars in the musical's main theme and the melody of ``Till
You.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I heard it, I said `Holy Cow! He stole my song,'''
said Repp, 56, who lives in Bel Air, Md. ``I want my song back.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Repp's music company, K &AMP; R Music, filed suit. But
in 1991, Lloyd Webber's lawyers struck back with a countersuit
alleging that Repp had in fact stolen the melody for ``Till You''
from a song from their client's 1969 musical ``Joseph and the
Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.''
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd Webber lost that suit, and Repp's suit was dismissed by
Judge Shirley W. Kram, who is also presiding over the current
trial. But in January, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
reinstated Repp's suit and ordered that it be tried before a jury.
</P>
<P>
   Repp's lawyers Monday offered the testimony of two professors of
music, James Mack and H. Wiley Hitchcock, both of whom said there
were similarities between the two compositions.
</P>
<P>
   The jury is expected to begin deliberations Tuesday. No further
performances are scheduled.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lloyd Webber also testified Monday that the impetus for his song
came in 1983 when he was trying to create a song for his wife at
the time, Sarah Brightman, who starred in the original New York
production of ``Phantom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to play around with what we could do with Sarah's
voice,'' Lloyd Webber said. ``And I just came up with this.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brightman, testifying earlier in the day, gave the same
version of events.
</P>
<P>
   Coulson also peppered Lloyd Webber with questions about musical
tastes and background, sometimes drawing unintended laughs from the
small crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I firmly believe there are two types of music,'' Lloyd Webber
said. ``Good and bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is just one of several high-profile copyright cases
involving musicals. In September, the family of the late composer
Jonathan Larson, who wrote the musical ``Rent,'' reached an
out-of-court settlement with Lynn Thompson, whose lawsuit claimed
that she had written some of the show's lyrics and dialogue.

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, Dec. 15:
</P>
<P>
   New York state's attorney general, Dennis Vacco, finally
conceded defeat on Monday _ 41 days after the polls closed. His
incendiary six-week fight to prevent the certification of his
Democratic challenger, Eliot Spitzer, failed to turn up hard
evidence of even one fraudulent vote cast, much less the widespread
vote fraud he and his Republican enablers loudly proclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco's unsuccessful quest to get the New York City police to
canvass challenged voters has left a bitter taste in minority
neighborhoods. Gov. George Pataki remained curiously aloof from
this travesty. But he can begin to repair some of the damage by
moving to replace its mastermind, state Republican Chairman William
Powers.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco, to his credit, says he will now work with Spitzer to
insure that there is no disruption in cases under litigation. As
for Spitzer, his early steps are encouraging. He plans to restore
the anti-discrimination protection for homosexual and lesbian staff
members that Vacco rescinded four years ago, and to allow capable
lawyers on the staff to remain, in contrast to Vacco's treatment of
the office as a patronage haven. He is also planning lawsuits and
other initiatives on behalf of consumers, the environment and civil
rights, potentially reviving the office as one of the nation's
premier public law agencies.

CHILDREN AND VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES: A WARNING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Conn., Mass., Wis., Minn.)  (af) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It's almost Christmas. Do you know what your children
are playing? Might they perhaps be ripping out the spines of their
enemies, perpetrating massacres of marching bands and splatting
their screens with sprays and spurts of pixelated blood?
</P>
<P>
   Such hair-raising queries have become as seasonal a ritual as
gift-giving. Each year since 1995, as parents have bought more and
more computer and video games for their children, a posse of two
United States senators and a media-watch group has issued a report
card meant in part to warn of certain games' violent content.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the report card issuers focused on a small group of
ultra-violent games they said would be better termed ``kill-for-fun
murder simulations'' than games. They cited evidence that such
thrill-killing was being marketed to children, who can gain access
to the games in poorly policed stores or on the Internet, and
warned of their ``antisocial'' and ``perverse'' bent.
</P>
<P>
   They did not list the ultra-violent games, but one of the
senators, Joseph I. Lieberman, D-Conn., particularly complained
about advertisements for the games Point Blank, Die by the Sword
and Cardinal Syn.
</P>
<P>
   For the last four years, ``whack-and-hack'' players have
responded pretty much like Sylvainson Gelin, an 11-year-old
aficionado of Mortal Kombat and Resident Evil, when caught between
plays at an arcade in Somerville, Mass., this week. Politicians who
condemn violent games, he said, ``should try it out themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they try it out, they'll see why we like it so much,''
Sylvainson said. ``It's fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Game makers, for their part, have often reacted to the report
card much like Jamey Harvey, the chief executive officer of Digital
Addiction, a game company: ``We tend to ignore all that hype,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey compared the political hubbub around video games to the
outcry from some Senators in the 1950s ``screaming about how
rock-and-roll was going to destroy the country.''
</P>
<P>
   But one difference is that the technology of video games is
exploding, and every year brings new questions and issues, even as
the game market expands wildly. It is expected to amount to about
$6 billion in retail sales this year, almost rivaling movie
box-office receipts, and has been growing at a rate of more than 30
percent annually, according to the Interactive Digital Software
Association, the industry's trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Games obtained on line often do not get parental scrutiny, so
this year, the watchdogs set their sights on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The report card issuers _ who, in addition to Lieberman, include
Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., and the National Institute on Media and the
Family, based in Minneapolis _ acknowledge that the rating system
established for video games in 1994, run by the Entertainment
Software Rating Board, is working very well.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all games sold in stores carry ratings that range from
EC for early childhood to M for mature (over 17) and AO for adults
only; and parents in doubt about a game can call the ratings
board's toll-free number _ (800) 771-3772 _ or go to its Web site,
at www.esrb.org.
</P>
<P>
   But increasingly, young players can download demos and sometimes
entire games on line, often without a credit card, and the vast
majority of those cyberversions are not rated.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in online games, said Dr. David Walsh, a psychologist
and president of the National Institute on Media and the Family,
prompted the report card writers to call parents' attention to the
need to monitor their children's Internet play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The knowledge gap between parents and kids in this whole realm
of media is an enormous knowledge gap,'' Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
   The report card cited its own survey of more than 500 parents,
which found that fewer than 5 percent of them had ever heard of
Duke Nukem, a violent game rated M, while 80 percent of junior high
students said they were familiar with it.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Video game supporters say that parents should indeed pay better
attention. But the Interactive Digital Software Association says
that surveys show that 9 of 10 buyers of games are adults, and that
adults are the main players of M-rated games as well. Over all, 7
of 10 players of computer games and 6 of 10 players of video games
on special consoles are over 18, the association says.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, said Douglas Lowenstein, the association's
president, rather than ``spanking the industry'' each year, the
issuers of the report card would do better to ``use their bully
pulpit to deliver a message to parents, saying, do not buy games
without looking into these ratings.''
</P>
<P>
   The report card also warned of what seemed to be a growing
tendency by some makers of violent games to market to youngsters,
from Duke Nukem action figures in toy stores to the rebellious
advertisements in video game magazines popular among young boys.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some of the advertisements do get graphic: ``As easy as
killing babies with axes,'' was one slogan quoted by the report
card, along with ``More fun than shooting your neighbor's cat'' and
``Happiness is a warm cranium,'' accompanied by a picture of a
severed head.
</P>
<P>
   If adults out buying games recently at the Best Buy store in
Cambridge, Mass., were any indication, some do worry about the
games' content, and stick to sports or scholastic games for their
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the games that you see, like this right here, this is
outrageous,'' said Harvey Lemay of Malden, Mass., gesturing toward
a shelf of violent games. ``This is teaching kids to go out and
fight in school, and get a bad attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   But others are not worried.
</P>
<P>
   John Sedleski, 44, a computer technician, said he let his
13-year-old son, James, start playing video games as soon as he
could handle a control pad, and introduced him to Mortal Kombat
when he was 7.

<P>
   ``I ignored what it said on it _ PC 13 or whatever it said on
it,'' he said. ``I laid the rules down to him a long time before
that: that this is pretend _ it's not real life. He buys that.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son doesn't get himself into trouble at school,'' Sedleski
said. ``He doesn't get in any trouble with the law; and he's a real
nice, polite kid, no matter who talks to him. It all depends on how
you bring your children up. It has nothing to do with how violent
the game is.''
</P>
<P>
   That point is the subject of jousting as lively as in any
fantasy fight, because, as both sides acknowledge, no research has
shown conclusively that playing violent on-screen games produces
violent real-life kids.
</P>
<P>
   The National Institute on Media and the Family and others argue
that extrapolating from studies of violent television, and positing
that interactive play provides an even more intense experience,
points to a real danger.
</P>
<P>
   The Interactive Digital Software Association and others counter
that children distinguish clearly between reality and fantasy, and
that studies have shown that it is real-life clashes and problems
at home that induce youth violence.
</P>
<P>
   A sampling of preteens interviewed at the arcade in Somerville
showed that most fell into the latter camp. Jean Syllien, 11, of
Cambridge, said: ``It's just watching TV and playing. It's not real
life.''
</P>
<P>
   And 8-year-old Richard McCoy of Malden, Mass., accompanied by
his encouraging mother as he shot miscreants with a blue plastic
handgun, allowed as how he thought the games might actually be good
for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be a cop,'' he said. ``I like to play gun games _
especially when I shoot all the bad guys. I think it's good
practice.''

THREE PROPOSED TELECOMMUNICATIONS MERGERS DRAW CHALLENGES AT AN FCC
HEARING 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Three of the largest proposed telecommunications
mergers in history were challenged Monday by consumer groups and
rival companies at a hearing that raised fundamental questions
about whether the broad deregulation of the industry, intended to
promote competition, was starting to have the opposite effect.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing was held by the Federal Communications Commission,
which faces some of its most significant decisions in years as it
considers what to do. If completed, the deals would reshape the
ownership of local and long-distance telephone service in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is reviewing whether to approve, block or impose
conditions on the proposed $56 billion acquisition of Ameritech by
SBC Communications; Bell Atlantic's $52 billion purchase of GTE,
and the AT&AMP;T Corp.'s $32 billion deal to buy Tele-Communications
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The proceeding Monday reflected the strident lobbying war
between the large telecommunications companies _ particularly
between the local and long-distance carriers _ that have so far
survived the wave of consolidation that has followed the passage of
the Telecommunications Act of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The act was passed by Congress and signed by President Clinton
as the best way to promote competition in the telecommunications
marketplace. It erased decades of laws, regulations and court
decisions that had put sharp limits both on new entrants coming to
market and on older established companies that wanted to expand
into new services and regions.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday some witnesses urged the FCC to intervene to prevent
the unintended consequence of promoting big mergers without
offering consumers any meaningful benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about what happens if the commission does nothing with
these mergers,'' said Gene Kimmelman, the co-director of the
Washington office of Consumers Union. ``This could be the final
nail in the coffin to competition in the local market.''
</P>
<P>
   William Kennard, the commision's chairman, stressed Monday that
the agency was required to review the deals in light of what would
serve the ``public interest.'' But precisely what that means is
months away from being determined.
</P>
<P>
   FCC staff members have begun to question the details of some of
the deals, suggesting that they may ultimately recommend severe
conditions be imposed on one or more of them.
</P>
<P>
   It is widely expected that the commissioners will impose some
conditions on all of the deals, as they have for some prior
mergers. But it is not clear whether there will be three votes
among the five commissioners either to impose onerous terms or to
take the extraordinary step of blocking a deal.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed acquisitions are also being examined by antitrust
regulators at the Justice Department who were criticized last year
by some groups for approving SBC's acquisition of Pacific Telesis
and Bell Atlantic's purchase of Nynex.
</P>
<P>
   As they have in the past, the companies that are seeking to
merge insisted today that they needed to combine in order to
promote competition, enter new markets, enhance their service and
keep prices down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know this commission wants to promote competition,'' said
Stephen M. Carter, a senior executive of SBC Communications. ``So
do we. Our merger is a product of competition _ competition for our
most profitable customers requires us to become a national and
global carrier, which will allow us to then compete for business
and residential customers nationwide. If you have any doubts, just
look at how much the competition is doing to stop this merger.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether SBC would be able to be as competitive even if it
did not buy Ameritech, Carter demurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only by scale that you'll get the competition that was
envisioned'' by the Telecommunications Act, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But several of the companies' customers and competitors urged
the commission not to allow local and long-distance phone service _
as well as access to the Internet _ to be in the hands of even
fewer companies.
</P>
<P>
   The SBC-Ameritech deal, for example, would shrink the number of
regional Bells, which were established in the 1984 breakup of AT&AMP;T,
to only four.
</P>
<P>
   ``This country has spent many years and many billions of dollars
to break up telecom monopolies and have competition,'' said J.
Richard Devlin, an executive vice president and general counsel of
the Sprint Corp. ``We simply cannot afford to go backwards, to
re-create Ma Bell, where prices were high and customer choice was
virtually nonexistent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``SBC and Ameritech are already very large companies,'' he
added. ``They are very capable of competing without merging.''
</P>
<P>
   Competitors of companies in the other deals raised similar
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Bell Atlantic's proposed merger with TCI, the giant
cable provider, Jonathan Sallet, the chief policy counsel of MCI
Worldcom, said that there was ``no public interest benefit that
would even come close to outweighing the anticompetitive and
anticonsumer consequences of such a combination.''

ARIZONA HIRES FRED GOLDMAN AS VICTIMS' RIGHTS ADVOCATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Fred Goldman, whose son was murdered in 1994 along
with O.J. Simpson's ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, has been hired
by the Arizona Attorney General's Office as a victims' rights
advocate.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, who moved to Scottsdale from California this year, will
be paid $23,500 a year as a half-time special assistant in the
Office of Victim Services.
</P>
<P>
   He will address complaints of rights violations and perform
victims' rights compliance audits of criminal and juvenile justice
agencies. He also will evaluate legislative proposals for their
effect on victim protections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fred Goldman is known the world over as an impassioned voice
for all victims of crime, especially violent crime,'' Attorney
General Grant Woods said. ``He has put a human face on the vast
number of Americans who live with the devastating effects of
violent crime every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who better to serve as this office's special representative on
behalf of Arizona victims?''
</P>
<P>
   Since Ron Goldman and Nicole Simpson were killed outside her
Brentwood, Calif., condominium, Fred Goldman has been adamant in
his belief that O.J. Simpson was the killer.
</P>
<P>
   Although Simpson was acquitted after one of history's most
publicized murder trials, the Goldman and Brown families won a
$33.5 million civil judgment against the former football star. They
have not received any money yet.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman said in a statement that he looked forward to his new
job. ``I hope that I can help increase the awareness of the needs
of victims,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Napolitano, who replaces Woods in January as attorney
general, said she wasn't consulted about Goldman's hiring, but had
no problem with the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to meeting with (Goldman) and discussing his
ideas on victim rights,'' Napolitano said. ``I have a pretty
aggressive victim rights agenda myself.'' &QL;

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
THE next time the empty suit that is Bud Selig stands up to address
baseball's ownership, he will not likely utter the one word that
would be music to the ears of his audience _ collusion.
</P>
<P>
   But don't think it wouldn't be tempting.
</P>
<P>
   That's because baseball is currently experiencing the worst
period in the history of the game. Which, considering all of the
self-destructive ills experienced by the national pastime in recent
years, is like telling survivors of the Titanic that this next
cruise might have some real problems.
</P>
<P>
   A frightening thought, indeed. But undeniably true.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it was just over four years ago when baseball
ownership claimed to be standing on the brink of economic disaster
and staring into an oblivion of red ink and shuttered franchises
unless a way were found to place a limit on salaries.
</P>
<P>
   They took a hard-line stance in 1994 in an attempt to implement
a salary cap or, at the very least, a luxury-tax system that would
stifle the spending of big-market clubs that was threatening
competitive balance. They canceled the last two months of the
regular season, cutting off pennant races at the knees. They wiped
the World Series off the sports calendar for the first time in 90
years. They alienated generations of loyal fans, who have only
begun to forgive them after a magical summer of Mark McGwire and
Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the NBA owners sit off to the side nodding their
heads and stiffening their resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball chopped off its foot, apparently for no good reason.
Because the system continues to be warped beyond all recognition as
free agent Kevin Brown signs a contract for $105 million, Mike
Piazza for $91 million, Bernie Williams for $87.5 million, Mo
Vaughn for $80 million and Jose By Gawd Offerman for $26 million.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Roger Clemens. He is not a free agent, but he
wants to be paid like one. He tells us the warm and fuzzy story
that he wants to come home, but not if it means leaving one cold
dollar on the table. The Astros dropped out of Toronto's auction
for Clemens _ until owner Drayton McLane Jr. jumped back in _
because the salary demands by the Rocket and his agents, Alan and
Randy Hendricks, were mind-boggling.
</P>
<P>
   Typical is more like it.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, scheduled to earn roughly $8 million per season over
the next two years, wanted his deal sweetened to an average of $14
million per because of the packages recently given to Brown and
Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   It was only 1993 when the baseball owners said the sky was
falling because Barry Bonds signed a six-year deal worth $43
million, making him the highest-paid player in the history of the
game. Now Los Angeles gives Brown a seven-year contract for $105
million and additional perks, including a hotel suite on the road
and 12 round-trip charter flights for his family each season. No
word on whether Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone has to turn
down Brown's bed each night and leave a mint on the pillow.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' belief that Clemens and the Hendrickses would give
them a financial break because of their Houston connection can be
attributed only to the ultimate in naivet or knuckleheadedness.
Clemens has always been about Roger first and the Hendrickses are,
well, agents. All scorpions sting.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, if we were to believe McLane's claim in 1994 that he
was losing $20 million a year and now his payroll has virtually
doubled, what got him in the Clemens derby to start with? Has he
found a secret revenue source? Has he learned to enjoy losing
money? Or is that just his nose growing longer?
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the bidding for Clemens will likely come down to a race
among Cleveland, Colorado, Texas and both New York franchises,
large revenue teams all, as baseball's competitive gap becomes the
most lopsided affair since the Christians vs. the lions. As we sit,
still 10 days before Christmas, you can probably write off about 18
major-league teams as having no shot at the playoffs in 1999, with
the foreseeable future looking just as bleak.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, it becomes a little more understandable as to why the NBA
owners are willing to hold firm with their lockout, even if it
means blowing up an entire season. The NBA owners are saying they
will not repeat baseball's mistake by accepting a potentially
crippling deal and finding themselves sitting back in the same
leaky boat in several years.
</P>
<P>
   So the NBA remains in dry dock, which for fans can be
frustrating. But it is preferable to being lost at sea, which for
baseball could be deadly.

 By DALE ROBERTSON  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
GOSH, what a big letdown. It really was about money after all.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roger Clemens' expressed longing to come home sounded so good,
especially to ears made suddenly less cynical by Ken Caminiti's
sincere desire to return to his baseball roots here. But what we
now must accept as the true underlying reason for Rocket's interest
in Houston was the opportunity to get filthy, grubby rich, instead
of merely rich. The ``coming home'' part was only an ancillary
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat amazingly, Drayton McLane Jr. actually seems
sympathetic as he battles to keep a slim chance for a trade with
Toronto alive. Having experienced an epiphany because of Randy
Johnson's sudden financial impact, the former Mr. Frugal has gotten
a tad greedy as well. You can just hear him talking to himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's see, 50,000 fans times 20 home starts times 25 bucks a
head ''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it's most tempting to keep the candle burning for Rocket
Roger. He's a special talent, perhaps a unique talent. He is not,
however, a special person, which Caminiti proved to be. He's just
another hypocritical jock, demanding the stars when he already owns
the moon and the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, we now realize, didn't want out of Toronto for
competitive, geographical, meteorological or sentimental reasons.
What he wanted was a renegotiated contract, never mind that the one
he signed _ presumably in good faith _ still has two seasons to run
and guarantees him $16.1 million, not exactly change of the chump
variety.
</P>
<P>
   I know, I know. Roger has to feed his family. He's got four
children. He feels obligated to guarantee their ``security,'' as if
the paltry $16.1 million couldn't possibly do that. In reality,
what he feels is a testosterone-driven desire to ensure that they
inherit more money in the end than either Johnson's or Kevin
Brown's kids.
</P>
<P>
   Grandkids, too.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't about quality of life, or even going to the World
Series with one of baseball's best lineups as a supporting cast.
This is about the new golden rule: ``He who has the most gold
rules.'' Winning at the bank matters more than winning on the
field, even if it's the home field, where Clemens' friends and
family could root him on.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens sees Johnson get $52 million for four years, and he sees
red. Then, he sees Brown sign for $105 million over seven years,
and he sees green.
</P>
<P>
   Word is the Astros were supposed to receive a brother-in-law
below-market deal for the five-time Cy Young Award winner's
services. Then came Brown's Dodgers bonanza, which set a new
standard for damn-the-torpedoes free spending and fulfilled every
dire prophecy about the dangers of letting a Rupert Murdoch get in
a position where he could further inflate an already ridiculously
bloated wage scale.
</P>
<P>
   If $43.5 million for the next three years _ two of which, repeat
after me, he's under contract for _ plus a fourth-year ``vesting
option'' for another $15 million is the cut rate, Rocket's sticker
price must be a doozy.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, in case you missed it, Clemens also desires suites, not mere
hotel rooms, on the road. Guess he figures he can't afford to pay
for the upgrades himself.
</P>
<P>
   Are you appalled? You should be, particularly after being
suckered by Rocket's ruse about the teary-eyed allure of home and
hearth. Yes, we should have known better.
</P>
<P>
   The Hendricks brothers, superstar agents Randy and Alan, are
Houstonians, the same as their superstar client. In their business,
they enjoy Clemens-sized stature and have at least as much dough in
the bank as he does to show for it. Their sworn duty, nonetheless,
is to break as many banks as possible on behalf of the many
mercenaries they represent. So don't expect serious compassion from
these homeboys, either.
</P>
<P>
   McLane conceded Monday that the trade has become a ``far, far
long shot'' and talked about being ``responsible'' regarding the
Astros' fiscal realities. But against the advice of his astute
baseball people, namely Executive of the Year Gerry Hunsicker and
the venerable Tal Smith, McLane stubbornly refuses to shoot the
deal in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker, incensed by the contemptible path the process has
taken, tried to follow the prudent path and was left looking
foolish by the owner, who publicly contradicted Gerry's
``not-only-no-but-hell-no'' verdict. McLane is the lone person in
the organization who believes trading two or more good players and
offering Clemens free-agent-type dollars has a smidgen of merit.
</P>
<P>
   You see that, and, whoa, it hits you. Maybe we're the dupes.
Could McLane, contrary to what he has been telling us, not be
losing that much money _ if any _ after all?
</P>
<P>
   And suppose Team Hendricks does lower its extortionate demands
significantly, admittedly an unlikely scenario. Then are we
supposed to be mollified, or does that simply confirm the magnitude
of the scam?
</P>
<P>
   When agents start dictating the terms of trading a player with a
binding contract, it's a safe assessment that baseball remains
very, very ill. We must fear the inmates will yet burn down the
asylum.

 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
DENVER _ For the first time since Dec. 8, 1997, the Denver Broncos
were forced to practice on Monday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Coach Mike Shanahan has a team rule that says if the Broncos
win, players can come in on their own on Mondays. Most of them are
in and out by 9 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Broncos lose _ something they hadn't done since
Pittsburgh beat them in the 15th game last season _ they have to
spend Monday at the office, just like normal people.
</P>
<P>
   After losing 20-16 to the New York Giants on Sunday, the Broncos
reported for a full day of film review, weightlifting,
rehabilitation and running.
</P>
<P>
   They barely got away in time to beat the traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it hadn't happened in such a long time, a lot of guys
kind of forgot what the schedule was like,'' tight end Shannon
Sharpe said. ``They had to call in and get the information.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I'm not going to sit here and lie. I would have
loved to have been 19-0. It would have been great, but the end
result's still the same. We want to win the big game. Ultimately,
that's what you're going to be judged by.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take 18-1, and I say we're still better than the '72
Dolphins.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Broncos blew their chance to join the 1972 Dolphins
as the NFL's only unbeaten and untied champions, become the NFL's
first 19-0 team and set a league record with 19 consecutive
victories, it was hard to tell in the dressing room Monday that
anything out of the ordinary happened Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is weird,'' running back Derek Loville said about the
full day of work. ``We haven't done this in a while. It's not
something we're going to get used to. This is our last Monday (to
practice).''
</P>
<P>
   By losing to the Giants on Kent Graham's 37-yard touchdown pass
to Amani Toomer in the final minute, the Broncos took some of the
luster off next Monday's game at Miami. Of course, they couldn't
care less about that angle.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos were divided on whether the pressure of an
undefeated season finally got to them. They had not dominated in
previous wins over San Diego and Kansas City, two teams with losing
records.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we still had that pressure,'' Shanahan said. ``I don't
enjoy losing, but life goes on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the season we had one goal, and it wasn't to go
unbeaten. It was to win another Super Bowl. Never in my wildest
dreams did I think about going unbeaten.''
</P>
<P>
   As the victories mounted and the pressure increased, safety
Steve Atwater thought the Broncos had become more focused on going
unbeaten than on the next opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't focused on winning,'' Atwater said. ``We were
focused on being 14-0. Sure, we practiced, but in the back of our
minds, the only thing you're thinking about is the outcome of the
game and not the job at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody was looking past them (the Giants) to
Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Neil Smith sounded glad the streak was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a burden, and the burden was heavy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In November, owner Pat Bowlen said he hoped the Broncos would
lose a game to take some of the pressure off so his team could
concentrate on becoming the seventh team to win consecutive Super
Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   After the Broncos finally lost, Bowlen had a change of heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said that when we were 8-0,'' Bowlen said. ``That was before
we really got into this streak. Now, I'm a little disappointed. I
kind of got caught up in it. It was fun for the city and the fans
of Denver.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Broncos lost two in a row before recovering to
win the regular-season finale against San Diego. They finished 12-4
and came up one game short of Kansas City in the AFC West. They
made the playoffs as a wild card and won four games, including
Super Bowl XXXII over Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   This season, they don't want to lose two of their last three.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be a wake-up call,'' Shanahan said. ``We can say, `Hey,
that's over. What are we made of? How do we bounce back?'
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to identify what we did wrong and try not to make the
same mistakes. I'm most concerned about our third-down defense and
our scoring in the red zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than a regular day at the office Monday, Shanahan won't
change a thing about the Broncos' preparation for the Dolphins. One
of the things that make Shanahan such a good coach is his
consistency with his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not here to set records or to get individual honors,''
Shanahan said. ``We're here to win the Super Bowl.

   ``If you don't beat yourself up after losing, something's wrong
with you. You're not made of the right stuff. But the key is how
you respond to the situation. Everybody has to find out what he did
wrong and what he could have done to affect the outcome of the
game. Then, he has to forget about it when he comes to work
Wednesday.''

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ A betting man wouldn't dare predict which team's
uniform Roger Clemens will be wearing next season, and the chances
of the five-time Cy Young Award winner's landing with the Astros
are hardly favorable.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It's a far, far long shot,'' Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr.
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's why he's so motivated to complete the deal
against all odds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made a career out of making complex things work,'' McLane
said. ``Even if it doesn't work out, it was worth the effort.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the effort is the sole responsibility of McLane, who
has emerged from the background as the chief negotiator in the
Astros' efforts to trade for Clemens. The issue appeared dead
Sunday when Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker called a news
conference to announce the Astros were dropping out of the race.
But McLane has pumped life back into the discussions and submitted
a counterproposal to Randy Hendricks, one of Clemens' agents, on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the Astros' offer are not available at this time, but
it's certainly worth less than the three-year, $43.5 million
proposal Hendricks sent to McLane over the weekend. Sources say the
original deal called for a fourth-year option worth an additional
$15 million and a $12 million signing bonus to be spread over the
life of the restructured contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's their turn now,'' said McLane, indicating the ball was in
Clemens' court. ``The first proposal was not anything we could come
close to.''
</P>
<P>
   McLane's decision to forge ahead in the Clemens negotiations
presumably goes against the advice of his baseball people. On
Sunday, Hunsicker stated the club's position as being
philosophically opposed to renegotiating the contract of a player
who already is signed for two more seasons, especially when it also
meant trading players to satisfy the Blue Jays' demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, what Gerry said was true,'' McLane said. ``We have
to do something that is fair. Even if we reach something with
Roger, we still have to be able to work out something with the Blue
Jays. I've said it before, but we have to be careful that we don't
do something stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker had no comment on McLane's decision to continue talks.
</P>
<P>
   The general belief among baseball observers is that Clemens is a
player under contract who wants to be treated like a free agent.
But the reality is that Clemens seemingly has unprecedented control
under an agreement with former Blue Jays president Paul Beeston,
who gave Clemens the right to demand a trade (with certain veto
powers) if he ceased to view the Blue Jays as contenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some very unique clauses in the contract that allow us
to do the things that we're doing,'' Hendricks said. ``We told
every team that we were looking for a contract extension. Wherever
Roger goes, he wants it to be for the rest of his career. Drayton
felt the first proposal was too rich but not so rich that he
couldn't come back with a counterproposal.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue could be resolved over the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Some baseball executives predictably were applauding the Astros'
restraint regarding Clemens' demands after Sunday's news
conference. More than $1 billion has been spent on free agents this
offseason, highlighted by the seven-year, $105 million contract
free-agent pitcher Kevin Brown and the Dodgers agreed to on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Bud Selig, a good friend of McLane's, has cautioned
owners against the potentially dangerous trend of escalating player
salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always pressure (from other owners),'' McLane said.
``But that was blown open Saturday. If we did something (with
Clemens), it wouldn't be anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   There also is the perception of pressure from the Astros'
in-state neighbors to the north. Hendricks said the Texas Rangers
have made a proposal, but as with the Astros, a trade package with
the Blue Jays would still have to be agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
   Some feel McLane is staying in the Clemens sweepstakes because
he couldn't stand to see the Texas legend wind up with the Rangers,
a la Nolan Ryan, who left the Astros to sign as a free agent with
the Rangers in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   McLane said such a perception could not be further from the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has nothing to do with it,'' he said. ``We are not in
competition with the Rangers. Would it be different if I saw that
the Cubs or the Cardinals (both division rivals) were interested?
You bet. But the Rangers are in the American League, and we don't
even play them in interleague play, so that has nothing to do with
it. (Rangers owner) Tom Hicks and I are friends. If they wind up
getting Roger, I'd give him a call to congratulate him.''
</P>
<P>
   McLane intends to exercise caution in the Clemens negotiations
because he believes the Astros are favorites to win their third
consecutive National League Central title even if they don't make
another personnel move.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a great team,'' McLane said. ``Everyone got all
stirred up last year when we lost Darryl Kile (to the Colorado
Rockies through free agency), but Shane Reynolds won 19 games for
us. We've already got good pitching with guys like Mike Hampton,
Jose Lima. And I think Shane Reynolds is one of the most underrated
pitchers in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like our team, but if there's something we can do to improve
it, we're always going to look at it. I still think (Clemens) is a
long shot, but I'm an eternal optimist.''
