<HEADLINE> Cyprus Hopes Recent Tension Reduced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government favors a
speedy resolution of the prolonged Cyprus question, said an
official spokesman today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing here, Government
Spokesman Manolis Christofides Christofides said it is important
to note that the existing tension on the Mediterranean island
warrants a speedy settlement in Cyprus and efforts toward this
goal should be intensified.
</P>
<P>
He said the Cypriot government shares the view of
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan that tension in and around
Cyprus should be reduced to avoid a confrontation.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Thursday Annan expressed concern about
reports of increased tension between Greek and Turkish forces in
connection with military exercises in and around Cyprus and the
Eastern Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
A five-day Greek-Cypriot naval and air war game ended Tuesday
while Turkey responded with repeated violations of Cypriot and
Greek air space and a plan of military exercises in northern
Cyprus next month.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman urged Turkey to stop provocative actions against
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Christofides also stressed that "we have the right to carry
out army maneuvers and this is what we did in cooperation with
one of the guarantor powers, Greece, which has guaranteed our
independence and territorial integrity."
</P>
<P>
Greece, Turkey and Britain were guarantors of Cyprus'
independence under the 1960 Treaty of establishment of the
Cyprus Republic.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island
following a failed pro-Athens coup by Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO allies, have long been at
odds over a number of issues concerning the Aegean Sea as
well as Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus and Greece have maintained a joint defense pact,
signed in 1993, under which Greece would provide Cyprus with
military assistance in case the island is attacked.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Get 800 Million Dollar Aid: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is expecting 800
million U.S. dollars of foreign aid from international donor
agencies in the next two months for its structural reform program,
Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz said here today.
</P>
<P>
After inaugurating a seminar on the country's 9th five-year
plan here, Sartaj told reporters that the foreign assistance is
expected to come from the World Bank, the International Monetary
Fund (IMF), the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Japan.
</P>
<P>
A meeting of the World Bank is scheduled to be held in the last
week of October to discuss and give its final approval to the
assistance of 250 million dollars for Pakistan's banking sector
reform program, Sartaj said.
</P>
<P>
"The World Bank will make the full disbursement once the loan
is approved at the board meeting," he said.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Sartaj said that a meeting of the ADB Executive
Board will be held on November 6 in Manila to give final approval
to its 250 million dollars of assistance under a Capital Market
Development Program Loan (CMDPL).
A team comprising officials of the Finance Ministry and
representatives of the Stock Exchanges visited Manila last month
and successfully concluded negotiations with the ADB for the loan
to restructure the capital market, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the finance minister said that Pakistan will also
get 300 million dollars as part of a 1.6-billion-dollar loan
package from the IMF.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the IMF Executive Board will meet in
Washington on October 20 to approve the 1.6-billion-dollar loan
under the Extended Structural Adjustment Facility and the Extended
Fund Facility which provide cheap loans to Pakistan.

ISLAMABAD, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Swedish Secretary of
Trade Yvonne Gustafsson said here today Pakistan can be a big
market for her country's investors "who are eager to invest here."
</P>
<P>
There is a great potential for mutually-beneficial cooperation
between Pakistan and Sweden in the fields of industry, science and
technology, said Gustafsson at a reception hosted by Swedish

</P>
<P>
Gustafsson, who is currently heading a high profile nine-member
trade and industry delegation to Pakistan, has earlier met with
Pakistani ministers for finance, commerce and communication.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's economy has bright prospects, once it starts picking
up, Gustafasson said. "But from experience in our country five
years back, I can say Pakistan needs to follow the economic
reforms diligently for that stage."
</P>
<P>
"The Swedish businessmen have shown keen interest in exploiting
the market potential that Pakistan offers and I am sure this visit
will bring more investment," she said.
</P>
<P>
Swedish Ambassador Rosenberg said the visit of the Swedish
secretary of trade will be rewarding in enhancing business
activities as well as strengthening the bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> US Industrial Production Remains Strong in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Output at U.S. factories,
mines and utilities jumped by a strong 0.7 percent in September,
pushing the industrial operating rate to 84.4 percent of capacity,
the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The operating rate in last month was the highest since February
1995. But the strong increase normally would also be a warning
signal of a growing inflation pressure in the country.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Fed said that much of the strength in industrial
production came from a 4.4 percent surge at utilities, pushing the
operating rate in the sector to 91.2 percent from 87.4 percent in
August.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing production increased by a moderate 0.4 percent
and raised the operating rate slightly to 83.4 percent from 83.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
The increases in the production of light trucks, computers and
commercial aircraft and clothing offset drops in production of
consumer appliances and industrial machinery.
</P>
<P>
U.S. mining production fell 0.5 percent last month because of
declines at coal mines and oil and gas wells.
</P>
<P>
In advance, U.S. economists were expecting somewhat smaller
gains in both housing starts and industrial production. The
reports on new home construction and the industrial production
showed the U.S. economy expanded strongly in September.

NEW DELHI, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Indian Agriculture Minister
Chaturanan Mishra today offered to step down in the face of
reported criticism of his ministry's performance by Prime Minister
Inder Kumar Gujral, the Press Trust of India (PTI) said.
</P>
<P>
In a strongly-worded letter to Gujral, the Communist Party
leader said "the press is reporting that you are not satisfied
with my performance as minister.... Please allow me to go and ask
my party to replace me by someone more capable."
</P>
<P>
"If you were not satisfied, you should have told me of this
instead of speaking through the press," the minister was quoted as
saying in the letter.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Prime Minister Gujral had expressed concern
over poor spending of budgeted resources by some of the
ministries, including the Agriculture Ministry, while reviewing
the first quarter (from April to June) performance of various
government departments.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters later today, however, Mishra disclosed
that the prime minister, who is visiting Punjab, had spoken to him
over phone.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that he had never criticized Mishra's
functioning and considered him one of the best ministers, Mishra
added.

<P>
ULAN BATOR, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The Mongolian parliament,
the Great Hural, today rejected the proposal by the Mongolian
People's Revolution Party (MPRP) that the government resign.
</P>
<P>
The vote, following two days heated debate in the Great Hural,
was participated in by 73 of the 75 parliament members, and ended
with 47 against and 25 for the motion.
</P>
<P>
During the debate, the ruling Mongolian National Democratic
Party argued that the country's economy had started to show
improvements, the result of the government's economic policies.
</P>
<P>
Mongolian President Nachagyn Bagabandy called on the
parliament to give the government a chance to correct its
mistakes. Dismissing the government was not the only way to solve
the country's problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
On October 4, MPRP members of the parliament submitted a draft
proposal to the Great Hural urging the government to resign on
grounds of corruption and because of a sluggish economy.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-three of the country's 75 parliamentarians, mainly from
the MPRP, signed the proposal.

HARARE, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean president Robert
Mugabe leaves Harare on Monday for Edinburgh, Scotland, to attend
the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM), the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs said today.
</P>
<P>
This year's heads of government meeting, scheduled to take
place between October 24 and 27, would for the first time focus
on economic rather than political issues under the theme "Trade,
Investment and Development -- the Road to Commonwealth
Prosperity", the ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting will also provide an opportunity to share ideas
on how the commonwealth can contribute to the sustainable
development of its member governments and to the economic
globalisation process," the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The problems of Cyprus, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Gambia would
be high on the agenda with heads of government reviewing
recommendations from the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group
(CMAG).
</P>
<P>
The CMAG was, through the Harare declaration, asked to monitor
good governance, human rights and democracy in member nations.
</P>
<P>
The commonwealth would also consider membership applications
from Rwanda and Yemen as well as the expression of interest in
joining the body from the Palestine national authority.
</P>
<P>
While in Edinburgh, Mugabe was also expected to hold talks
with British Prime Minister Tony Blair on a number of bilateral
and international issues, including the land issue.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe and his delegation were expected back home on October
29, the ministry said.

<P>
They joined French Open champion Gustavo Kuerten from Brazil

<P>
In Gold Group's last match Friday, Becker beat Jonathan Stark

Becker won over Italian Renzo Furlan 6-7, 6-3, 6-3 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Draper of the Red Group defeated Vincent Spadea of the United
States 6-1, 6-3. This was his second victory in the round-robin
group matches, following his 6-3, 6-2 win over Peter Tramacchi of
Australia on Wednesday. Tramacchi replaced the group's seeded

injuries.

<HEADLINE> New Offers to Open Financial Services Less Than Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The number of new or revised
offers to open financial services to foreign competition tabled at
talks ending today has been less than expected, a WTO official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
However, speaking at a briefing after the ending of a meeting
of the Committee on Trade in Financial Services of the World Trade
Organization (WTO), Committee Chairman Yoshio Okubo told
reporters, "I'm not discouraged by the limited number of offers as
of today, because more than a dozen delegations have expressed
their willingness to table their offers in a few weeks or as soon
as possible."
</P>
<P>
Okubo believed that negotiations meant to make a global pact to
free trade in financial services are on the track but time is
limited.
</P>
<P>
It has been the fifth meeting since the current negotiations
resumed in April. The tabling of the offers is a very important
aspect of the negotiations. Up to now, 24 offers have been
received from 38 participants, counting the European Community
(EC) as 15, and they are conditional and subject to the overall
outcome of the negotiations scheduled to end on December 12, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Further meetings of the committee are planned in November with
a final meeting scheduled for December 12.

<P>
It is believed to be the first-ever workshop of this kind in

The conference, whose theme is called "Ecotourism -- Charting

On the sidelines of the conference will be an exhibition of

heritage, handicrafts and tourism development efforts of Kenya's
40-plus diverse cultures.
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 delegates from the U.S., Britain, South Africa,
Mexico, Brazil, Belize, Tanzania, Swaziland, Uganda, Australia,
Botswana, Namibia, Mozambique, Malawi, Zimbabwe and other
countries will attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Ecotourism, defined as "responsible travel to natural areas
that conserves the environment and sustains the well-being of
local people," was popularized in Latin America first and became
a well-known idea during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
At the root of the ecotourism experience is the long history
of nature tourism which has flourished in the national parks of
the Untied States for over 100 years and in Kenya since the
1970s.

<HEADLINE> Washington Monument to Be Repaired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The Washington Monument, the
towering landmark on the skyline of the United States' capital,
will soon undergo repairs.
</P>
<P>
Target discount stores are leading a private corporate effort
to pay the five-million-dollar bill for the most extensive
overhaul of the monument since it opened to the public in 1888,
The Washington Post said.
</P>
<P>
Though the monument will close for up to four months early next
year for elevator and climate control repairs, it will remain open
for exterior work that will go on at least until the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Target, a division of retailer Dayton Hudson Corp. based in
Minneapolis, is putting up the first one million dollars and
rounding up other donors to pay the rest of the bill.
</P>
<P>
General Electric is developing a lighting system for night
illumination of scaffolding designed by architect Michael Graves.
The scaffolding and a transparent covering, to be erected next
June, is designed to blend in with the monument's exterior while
allowing observers to see the memorial beneath the steel network.
</P>
<P>
The corporate involvement in restoring a national monument is
part of a growing trend in tight-money times.

<HEADLINE> EU to Sponsor Clearing of Minefields in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Tenders for the 96 million U.S.
Dollars landmine clearing project have been invited to clear the
northeastern areas of Zimbabwe of deadly mines planted during the
war of liberation along border areas, the Zimbabwe News Agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The tender invitation says the demining would be sponsored by
the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The clearing of the minefields would create valuable land for
agriculture to adjacent rural areas.
</P>
<P>
There are seven minefields about 750 kilometers mostly along
the border areas.
</P>
<P>
Communities in the border areas of Zimbabwe have lived in fear
since before independence in 1980 because of the danger of mines.
</P>
<P>
The mines have killed or maimed unsuspecting civilians who
mistook them for toys or touched them for other reasons.
</P>
<P>
The clearing of the mines comes in the wake of the a worldwide
campaign to ban the manufacturing and sale of anti-personnel
mines.

<HEADLINE> Dread El Nino Arrives in Zimbabwe: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 17 (Xinhua) -- A Zimbabwean climate expert
confirmed today that the dread El Nino weather phenomenon had
finally arrived in the country.
</P>
<P>
Coordinator of climate change in the Ministry of Mines,
Environment and Tourism Todd Ngara said the unusual cold spell
and spring rains being experienced in the country are typical El
Nino patterns.
</P>
<P>
He said the current phenomenon would pass on towards December,
resulting in high temperatures, sporadic and little rains.
</P>
<P>
Ngara, however said the country may not experience drought
conditions, but the probability is "very" high.
</P>
<P>
In 1991/92, the country experienced the worst drought in
living memory due to the El Nino, which caused heavy flooding in
northern pacific countries.

<HEADLINE> GCC Seeks Japanese Funds to Diversify Economies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) states have identified more than 100 industrial projects
they intend to present to Japanese investors as part of a drive to
diversify the oil-reliant Gulf economies.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 400 officials and businessmen from the six GCC
countries and their main economic trade partner Japan will gather
in Bahrain next month to discuss joint industrial ventures and
trade, the United Arab Emirates (UAE)'s Wam news agency said today.
</P>
<P>
The GCC has prepared a list of more than 100 feasible
industrial projects, mainly on light and medium products, to be
put forward to the Japanese side, according to Wam.
</P>
<P>
The November 23-26 conference in Bahrain will be held under
the theme "towards the establishment of permanent common
interests."
</P>
<P>
It is the nearest in the future in a series of meetings between
the two sides aimed at strengthening economic links and increasing
Japan's exports to the GCC countries, one of the major consumer
markets in the world.
</P>
<P>
Japan is GCC's top trade partner with two-way exchanges
standing at 36 billion U.S. dollars in 1996, nearly one third of
the alliance's total trade volume.
</P>
<P>
Japan also receives more than 70 percent of its oil needs from
the region and is increasingly reliant on Gulf liquefied natural
gas.
</P>
<P>
The GCC countries have pumped nearly 55 billion U.S. dollars
into more than 5,000 industrial projects in a drive to ease
dependence on oil earnings.

</P>
<P>
He told visiting Chinese Vice-minister of Foreign Affairs Tian

Africa, developing countries and the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>

last year reaffirmed China's continuing development of its
relations with Africa and Chinese principles for developing
relations with African countries.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his admiration to Chinese leaders, the Chinese
government and the Chinese people for their support and
contributions to Africa.

<HEADLINE> Lopez: No Imminent Clash Exist Between Greece, Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Admiral Joseph Lopez,
Commander-in-Chief of allied forces in southern Europe, today
ruled out the possibility that a serious incident between Greece
and Turkey will happen in the Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in the northern Greek port city
of Thessaloniki after completion of the evaluation of the recent
NATO exercise "Dynamic Mix '97", Lopez said that the information
and indications he had received so far did not lead him to the
conclusion that a serious incident was imminent in the Aegean.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that NATO was doing everything possible to
secure cooperation and prevent clashes in the region.
</P>
<P>
"we are cooperating with diplomatic, economic and political
organizations and we support political solutions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the harassment this week of the aircraft carrying
Greek Defense Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos by Turkish warplanes,
both on his way and returning from Cyprus, Lopez stressed the
importance of dialogue, saying that "dialogue and cooperation are
helpful, regardless of whether they are conducted at a political or
military level."
</P>
<P>
As for NATO's new role following the political changes in
recent years, he said that the enemy was instability and the aim
of the alliance was to consolidate peace and stability through
dialogue and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO allies, have long been at odds
over a number of issues regarding the Aegean Sea as well as
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Tension between the two neighbors has in recent months been
intensified following the fruitless New York talks between the two
countries' foreign ministers, military exercises by Greece and
Cyprus and the repeated violations of Greek and Cypriot air space
by Turkish warplanes.

<HEADLINE> US Drug Sales Increase Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 17 (Xinhua) -- US drug sales in the year to
August 1997 rose to 65 billion US dollars, 14 percent up on the
same period last year and almost four time as fast as those in
Europe, the Financial Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Citing a report by specialist pharmaceuticals market
researchers IMS International, the newspaper said that the sharp
increase in US sales so far this year is set to continue.
</P>
<P>
However, by contrast, drug sales in the seven biggest European
markets rose only four percent to 54.3 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that drug growth varied widely in Europe,
with UK and Spain growing the fastest, both rising eight percent
to 7.4 billion US dollars and 4.9 billion respectively. Italy
comes next, where sales rose seven percent to 8.8 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Germany is the slowest growing market in Europe, with sales
inching up one percent to 15 billion US dollars. Then comes
France, with sales growing two percent to 14.2 billion US dollars.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Disaster Reduction Experts Pass Action Plan for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Experts passed an Action Plan
for disaster reduction activities over the next two years to be
implemented by a broad coalition including the United Nations,
governments, non-governmental organizations and the private sector
after a week-long meeting ending here today.
</P>
<P>
The ninth session of the Scientific and Technical Committee
(STC) of the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction
(IDNDR) was held here on October 13-17. The STC is an advisory
body of 25 experts around the world, appointed by the United
Nations Secretary-General, to provide scientific and technical
advice on disaster reduction issues.
</P>
<P>
In its final statement, the STC reaffirmed "the need for all
governments around the world to integrate disaster reduction and
risk management as an essential element of their development
planning and sustainable development policies". "It is of
paramount importance to ensure that there is a concerted and
coordinated international approach to risk reduction strategies in
the 21st century," it added.
</P>
<P>
"There will otherwise be no international foundation for risk
reduction strategies at the closing of the International Decade
for Natural Disaster Reduction (1990-2000). A new approach to
disaster reduction, on the basis of an evaluation of the IDNDR's
achievements, must be collectively agreed to by the international
community", the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The IDNDR plan of activities for the next two years is based on
five primary themes: hazards, vulnerability and risk assessment;
early warning issues; disasters and sustainable development;
political and public policy commitment; shared knowledge and
technology transfer.

<HEADLINE> Annan Urges Renewed Determination to Combat Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 17 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today called upon international society to work
together more closely and at all levels of the United Nations to
spearhead the war against poverty.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion of the International Day for the
Eradication of Poverty, the Secretary-General said that some
individuals were enjoying wealth on a scale previously unimagined.
Yet, victims of poverty still endured intolerable froms of
deprivation. They continued to be marginalized and excluded. The
International Day for the Eradication of Poverty remained us world
of the road we had yet to travel and the battles we had yet to
win.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief said the relative incidence of poverty had
declined somewhat. But the number of the world's poor had risen
considerably. Almost one quarter of the world's population still
lived in a state of poverty.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that poverty had always been a prime concern in the
work of the United Nations. In recent years, the fight against
poverty had been the subject of heightened attention. The
eradication of poverty had also become the common thread of major
United Nations conferences of the 1990s, especially the world
summit for social development.
</P>
<P>
He said eradication of poverty required enhanced economic
growth and employment opportunities. The causes of poverty should
also be addressed in the context of sectoral strategies, such as
the environment, food security, population, migration, health,
shelter, human resources development, fresh water and rural
development.
</P>
<P>
Annan stressed that there was no shortage of strategies and
plans, analyses and statistics, approaches and measures. What we
needed was a renewed determination and willingness to bring all
sectors together in one unstinting effort.

<HEADLINE> Nyerere Advocates Economic Solidarity Of African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the South
Commission, Julius Nyerere, has reiterated his call for economic
solidarity among African countries, especially those in the
sub-Sahara region to enhance their capacity for development.
</P>
<P>
If Africans do help each other, no one else would come to
their rescue because the interest of Africa is not in the
interest of the main power blocs in the world, said Nyerere today
in Johannesburg, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
He said sub-Sahara Africa has been isolated because it is not
in the orbit of any of the power blocs of the rich north.
</P>
<P>
For instance, he noted, while the US might be afraid of
unemployment in Mexico and would devise strategies to deal with
it and while Europe might similarly fear north African
unemployment, they have no similar reasons for fearing
unemployment in sub-Saharan Africa because it is isolated from
them.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, "we in sub-Saharan Africa can easily be
forgotten," said the former president of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he called on African countries to rethink about
themselves and work together for the benefit of all their people.
</P>
<P>
Speaking particularly on South Africa, which is regarded as an
economic "big brother" of Africa, Nyerere said South Africa
should work out not only for its own benefit, but also for the
benefit of all Africa.
</P>
<P>
"You have to prosper together with neighbors, because if you
decide to go it alone, you will be overwhelmed by the poverty of
your neighbors," the seasoned statesman said.
</P>
<P>
On the latest developments in Africa, Nyerere stressed the
need for democratic practices in all countries, and cautioned the
governments not to behave like sponges that soak everything which
come to their way.
</P>
<P>
"The era of the Mobutus or Mobutuism is gone," he said.
"Africa needs properly elected governments which are responsive
to the needs of the people.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere who arrived in Johannesburg on Wednesday is expected
to introduce his recently formed Mwalimu Nyerere Foundation to
South African opinion makers and businessmen.

LAGOS, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Sweden's permanent representative to
the United Nations, Hans Dahlgren, has been elected chairman of the
committee set up by the Security Council to supervise and implement
the sanctions on Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> Bre-X Shareholders Sue for Three Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Shareholders of Bre-X Minerals
Ltd. has sued its directors, financial advisers and engineering
consultants for three billion dollars (2.1 billion USD), a report
said today.
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit came less than 24 hours after a judge in the
Canadian province of Alberta paved the way for derivative actions.
</P>
<P>
Derivative suits rob defendants of one powerful potential
defense argument that their duty was to the firm, not to the
shareholders directly.
</P>
<P>
The latest suit is filed in the name of the Calgary,
Alberta-based exploration firm, the Financial Post newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed Thursday in Ontario Court, names SNC-Lavalin
Inc. and its Kilborn Engineering subsidiaries, J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co.
Inc., Republic National Bank of New York as well as Bre-X officers
and directors.
</P>
<P>
"The conduct of the insiders...was high-handed, outrageous,
reckless, wanton, entirely without care, deliberate, callous,
disgraceful, willful...and motivated by economic considerations,"
the statement of claim said.
</P>
<P>
Wall Street powerhouse J.P. Morgan and Republic National Bank
"should have known the plaintiff was relying in part on the due
diligence investigations conducted by the financial advisers," the
statement noted.
</P>
<P>
The suit is the latest of several class action lawsuits filed
for investors who lost heavily when the Indonesian gold find
turned out to be a hoax.

ADDIS ABABA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Deputy Prime
Minister Kassu Ilala said today that the pressing demand for
energy supply in the country would be mitigated with the entry into
service of hydroelectric power stations in the coming five and
six years.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at a trade fair and bazaar here, Kassu said
efforts are being made to generate an additional power of 700 mega
watt which will help supply power to the industry sector at a
relatively low price.
</P>
<P>
He said, the plan to install an additional 600,000 telephone
lines in a bid to raise access to communication facilities.
</P>
<P>
The service of mobile telephone will start in a few months
time, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the sub-sector of the metal engineering industry which
could have a great bearing on the overall development is now
receiving the necessary support following the establishment of an
independent agency responsible for its revitalization.
</P>
<P>
On the training institutes to be set up in the country, Kassu
said a new tanning and leather products industry training institute
would begin operation next year while a textile technology
training program has already been launched this year.
</P>
<P>
He added that four additional engineering faculties which
could train students at degree level are being set up bring the
total number of such faculties to five.

<HEADLINE> UK Planned Super-SIB Will Not Work, Warns Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 17 (Xinhua) - Britain's plans to roll nine
different financial regulators into a single organization will not
work, an expert on the subject warned.
</P>
<P>
Michael Taylor, a reader in financial regulation at the
University of Reading, said in his book entitled Will Super-SIB
Work? The planned organization will have to take on so many tasks
that it will be unable to operate effectively.
</P>
<P>
Super-SIB will suffer from "management overstretch from an
impossibly broad range of responsibilities, from conflicting
cultures, from a lack of accountability and oversight", he warned.
</P>
<P>
It was announced earlier that the new organization plans a
ceremonial launch on October 20.
</P>
<P>
Taylor, a former Bank of England official, said the case for a
single regulator for the entire financial services sector has
"triumphed by default and the policy issues it raises have not
begun to be addressed".
</P>
<P>
He argued that it was very difficult for one regulator to
pursue conflicting goals such as the stability of the financial
system, the protection of consumers and the preservation of
orderly markets.
</P>
<P>
Taylor's proposal is for separate commissions, charged
respectively with financial stability, consumer protection and
market integrity.

KAMPALA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The fourth east African
technical working groups meeting on common border initiative
opened in Masaka, southwestern Uganda today, reported Radio
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Opening the meeting, the Ugandan State Minister for Foreign
Affairs in charge of regional cooperation, Rebecca Kadaga, said
that the Ugandan government has been able to dismantle the
barriers to the cross border flow of foods, persons and capital.
</P>
<P>
She ensured the delegates that the government will continue
diversifying itself from business and create more opportunities
for the private sector and also create confidence in private
sector's useful partners in the economic development of three
east African countries.
</P>
<P>
She noted that some aspects of cross border initiatives are
costly for some governments which need a lot of revenue,
employment and heavy competition for infant industries.
</P>
<P>
Kadaga hoped that the technical working groups will continue
providing technical support for the project implementation
committees in their respective communities.
</P>
<P>
The consultant of regional economic integration project, Sam
Katabazi, said that the objective of the meeting is to harmonize
and review what has been done and achieved by member states of
the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) since
1992.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Firms Not Train Staff Enough, Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Canada risks a slip in its
competitiveness in the knowledge-based global economy if its
companies don't train their employees, according to the latest
report from an economic think-tank here.
</P>
<P>
Currently, less than one-third of Canadian firms do any
training at all, says the report, which was prepared by the
Conference Board of Canada.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, about 74 percent of employees in Japan and 80
percent in Britain receive on the job training.
</P>
<P>
"Canadian industry, generally, is underinvesting in the
development of its human resources," the report says.
</P>
<P>
Most Canadian firms minimize labor costs to stay competitive,
which means the workers don't learn the skills that would make
them more productive, notes the report.
</P>
<P>
The status quo is worrisome, since research shows
employer-based training produces a 30 percent rate of return
compared with just 10 percent from formal higher education, the
report says.
</P>
<P>
A recent poll of workers in 49 countries by the World Economic
Forum found Canadian rate their workplace worse than those of
other nations for in-company training.

<HEADLINE> South Africa Cuts Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 17 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's central bank,
the Reserve Bank, has decided to cut its lending rates by one
percentage point to 16 percent with effect from next Monday, South
African Press Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the financial aggregates used by the Reserve Bank as a
basis for monetary policy decisions have moved in the right direction
recently to justify a reduction in the bank rate," Reserve Bank
governor Chris Stals said today.
</P>
<P>
Stals said that while certain statistics, such as money supply,
remained above the bank's guidelines, recent declines were
nevertheless encouraging.
</P>
<P>
The money supply increased by an annualized 13.9 percent in
August, down from 15.9 percent in April this year, but was still above
Stals' target of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Credit extended to the private sector had fallen from over 17
percent in April to a relatively high 14.6 percent in August, but the
three month seasonally adjusted average to August had declined to a
low of 5.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Stals said he was encouraged by the turnaround since early this
year in the trend for consumer and producer inflation.
</P>
<P>
The consumer price index peaked at 9.9 percent in April before
falling to 8.7 percent in August, while the producer price index has
dropped to 5.9 percent from a high of 9.6 percent in March this year.
</P>
<P>
Other positive trends were the stabilization of the exchange rate
since the sharp depreciation of 21.9 percent last year, and the jump
in gross reserves from only 10.3 billion Rand (2.2 billion U.S.
Dollars) at the end of last year to the current 26.5 billion (5.6
billion dollars ).
</P>
<P>
"South Africa has successfully weathered the storms of last year in
the foreign exchange market and has, to an important extent, succeeded
in preventing an escalation in the adverse effects of the depreciation
on domestic financial conditions," Stals said.
</P>
<P>
The progress made in establishing greater financial
stability should contribute to job creation, he added.
</P>
<P>
South African commercial banks can be expected to follow the
Reserve Bank's lead and reduce their prime lending rates in the near
future.

<HEADLINE> NAACP Urges Revising Dictionary Definition of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) is backing calls for
Merriam-Webster to revise its dictionary definition of the word
"nigger."
</P>
<P>
The Merriam-Webster dictionary's 9th and 10th editions defines
the word as "a black person... usually taken to be offensive."
</P>
<P>
NAACP President Kweisi Mfume said that definition "doesn't say,
`Once used to describe a black person, a slur.' It says, `A black
person.'"
</P>
<P>
"The NAACP finds it objectionable that the Merriam-Webster
would use black people as a definition for a racist term," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Baltimore-based NAACP said it would lead a boycott against
the publisher if the word's definition is not revised, The
(Baltimore) Sun reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Two Michigan women began the push earlier this year to have the
word banned or its definition revised. One, Delphine Abraham,
drafted a petition calling for the word's removal from the
dictionary.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people contacted Merriam-Webster after its
definition of the racial slur was printed in the September issue
of Emerge magazine. The publishing company said in a statement
that it was "reviewing our treatment of this word to see if there
are better ways to present this information."
</P>
<P>
"We have tried to make it clear that the use of this word as a
racial slur is abhorrent to us, but it is nonetheless part of the
language, and as such, it is our duty as dictionary makers to
report on it," the company said.
</P>
<P>
In Merriam-Webster's most recent edition, a paragraph was
added, saying that "nigger," although used by writers like Mark
Twain, Joseph Conrad and Charles Dickens, is perhaps the most
offensive and inflammatory racial slur in English.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese aircraft manufacturers made
flying demonstrations today at an air force base in Zambia's capital in
a bid to market their aviation products.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations, which is co-sponsored by China Aviation Industry
Corporation and China Aviation Technology Import and Export
Corporation, attracted several hundred people including Chitalu Sampa,
Minister of Home Affairs, R. Shikapwashya,
Air Force Commander and Wang Yunxiang, Chinese Ambassador to Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Chinese aircraft manufacturers have focused their attention in
recently years on the African market where the Chinese-made aviation
products are more popular because of their good quality and low
prices, He Fukang, deputy managing director of the Nanchang-based
company told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations are aimed to make more and more potential
African buyers to know about China's advanced aeronautical
technologies and expand China's market shares,
said He.
</P>
<P>
During the two-hour demonstrations, one delicately designed K-8 jet
trainer, which is made by Nanchang Aircraft Manufacturing Company and
whose speed varies from 180 kilometers to 800 kilometers per hour,
made dazzling exhibition and aroused bursts of warm applause from the
viewers.
</P>
<P>
The other two aircraft, one Y-7 100 airliner for feeder lines and
one Y7H-500 transport plane also made wonderful demonstrations to show
their excellent functions compared with their low prices.
</P>
<P>
Both of them are made by Xi'an Aircraft Industry Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese flying demonstration was first made earlier this week
in Zimbabwe and will continue in Kenya and Ethiopia.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Supreme Leader Condemns US Presence in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Supreme leader Ali
Khamenei today condemned the presence of U.S. military forces
in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei, also commander-in-chief of the Iranian armed forces,
said "by their presence in the region, the Americans have
engendered insecurity in the region" and created threats of war.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian leader made the strong-worded statement while
addressing 50,000 members of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps
(IRGC) and volunteer forces at a military camp in Karaj, about 50
kilometers east of Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Thereby, he added, the presence of the U.S. forces made the
nations of the region suspicious of each other.
</P>
<P>
He said that Americans "must get out of the region and return
to their own territorial waters."
</P>
<P>
The statement by Khamenei is clearly referring to the
deployment of the U.S. nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Nimitz in
the Gulf last week. Iran condemned the arrival of Nimitz aircraft
carrier and termed it as "major source of tension" in the region.
</P>
<P>
On October 12, the Nimitz aircraft carrier moved into the
Persian Gulf with its battle group of six warships for operations
near Iraq's volatile border with Iran, thus making the situation
alarming in the region.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei urged the littoral states in the Persian Gulf to have
a logical and reasonable defense force of their own.
</P>
<P>
The best model is the defense forces of Iran which aims to
stress the people's responsibility to defend their nation and the
self-sufficient military industries, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Feuding Kurdish factions
have agreed to stop fighting, which has last several days in
northern Iraq, under the mediation of Western countries, the State
Department said today.
</P>
<P>
The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) and the Kurdistan
Democratic Party (KDP) declared the cease-fire at 20:00 hours
local (1700 GMT) and the United States, Turkey and Britain, who
jointly sponsored a peace process among the Kurds, called upon the
two Kurdish factions to observe the cease-fire, the State
Department said.
</P>
<P>
Clashes between the two groups broke out a week ago and PUK
forces were reported to have hit the KDP headquarters in the town
of Sararush.
</P>
<P>
The State Department said the three countries co-sponsoring the
so-called Ankara peace process had established that the cease-fire
violations came from PUK-controlled territory. They called on the
PUK to withdraw to positions they held before October 12.
</P>
<P>
"We were involved very intensively the past three days to try
to walk the parties back and observe a cease-fire," State
Department spokesman James Foley said. "This finally bore fruit
today."

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Turkey, the United States
and Britain today called on two warring northern Iraqi parties
to respect cease-fire and immediately stop their fighting.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a written statement that
the three sponsors of the two-year-old Ankara process urged the
Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan (PUK) to withdraw their troops from the conflicting
areas.
</P>
<P>
"The three countries hold that any fighting in this area is
unacceptable," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Iranian PUK and the KDP, allegedly backed by Turkey
and Iraq, have been fighting each other for the control of
northern Iraq following the 1990 Gulf War. Over the past several
days, clashes between them intensified in the region.
</P>
<P>
The statement also quoted the Peace Monitoring Force (PMF) as
confirmed that it was the PUK that provoked the clashes,
demanding an immediate cease-fire for the resumption of PMF
operation.
</P>
<P>
The first PMF group, comprising 180 Iraqi Turkmens and 20
Assyrians, was deployed in northern Iraq last April to supervise
the truce reached between PUK and KDP earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The Ankara process, designed to end the armed conflicts in
northern Iraq, had hold three rounds of peace talks in the
Turkish capital since early last year.

WASHINGTON, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Treasury's main

GENEVA, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Nathalie Tauziat of France ended
Lisa Raymond's run of superb form with a 6-3, 7-5 semifinal
victory over the American Saturday in the European indoor
championships in Zurich.
</P>
<P>
Raymond has beaten Martina Hingis and other three players in
the world's top 10 in the last 10 days.
</P>
<P>
Tauziat will meet the winner of the other semifinal between
doubles partner, defending champion Jana Novotna, and Lindsay
Davenport.
</P>
<P>
Back on court just 16 hours after handing Hingis only her
fourth defeat of the season, Raymond displayed none of the zip she
had shown against the Swiss teenager as Tauziat broke her twice on
the way to winning the first set.
</P>
<P>
While Raymond was able to fight her way back from a similar one
set deficit against Hingis, there were no such heroics against
Tauziat who matched the American shot-for-shot in the second
before breaking her at 6-5 to win the match.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The Xijiang River, a major
tributary of China's third largest river, the Zhujiang, was
blocked this evening for construction work on the Guigang
Navigation Hub.
</P>
<P>
The work was difficult because of the velocity of the river and
an enormous water flow, but was done one month ahead of schedule
in November. Engineers hope to have one more dry month for
construction.
</P>
<P>
The project began in November 1994 and has cost two billion
yuan, including 80 million US dollars in World Bank loans, for
construction, clearing the project area and the channel, and
setting up a transportation network.
</P>
<P>
It is the second phase of the Xijiang Project, which was
approved by the central government in 1981, for clearing the 854
km-waterway between Nanning, the capital of the Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region, and Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong
province, and is part of a government plan for a large
transportation network of waterways, railways and highways.
</P>
<P>
The Guigang Navigation Hub consists of a dam, shiplocks, and
generators with a total capacity of 120,000 kw.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's French Open champion
Gustavo Kuerten and Zimbabwe's Byron Black won berths in the final
of the 1997 Marlboro Tennis Championships in Victoria Park on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Kuerten beat Australian Scott Draper 6-3, 6-4 and Black took
the other final berth of the 722,500 U.S. dollar event by edging
Germany's former world number one Boris Becker 7-6 (7-3), 6-7
(6-8), 6-4.
</P>
<P>
As an unseeded 21-year-old right-hander, Kuerten took the crown
of this year's French Open by beating Spain's Sergi Bruguera in
straight sets.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian took an upper hand in the semi-final against
Draper Saturday, when he broke service three times and unleashed
seven Aces in the one-hour-three-minute match.
</P>
<P>
Becker, now 29 and ranked 22nd in the world, has been taken as
one of the greatest singles player in the world. Long-standing
injuries and age took the toll as he looked exhausted in the third
and final set.
</P>
<P>
Black, who won the doubles title with Canadian Grant Connell at
last year's Marlboro championships here, is ranked 61st in the
world. His highest singles ranking is 22nd in April last year.
</P>
<P>
Becker and Black had met twice before and both of the 1995
matches ended in favor of the German.
</P>
<P>
Both Becker and Black held their service in the opening
set. Becker made seven Aces while making numerous unforced errors,
which cost him the set 7-6 (7-3).
</P>
<P>
Becker improved his service and scored nine Aces in the second
set and, with successful volleys, he won the set 7-6 (8-6) to
level with the Zimbabwe ace.
</P>
<P>
Black gradually took the initiative in the third set after
breaking Becker's service in the opening game and he never gave up
the lead to win the set 6-4 and the match of two hours and eleven
minutes.
</P>
<P>
The championships final is set for Sunday afternoon. Kuerten
and Black split honors in their two previous meetings, in the ATP
hard court events in Memphis and Indian Wells, earlier this year.

had solved other issues through mediation and arbitration.

<HEADLINE> African Defense Chiefs to Meet in Harare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Chiefs of defense staff of the
OAU will meet in Harare next Friday to reflect on the continent's
present and future peacekeeping initiatives since the launch in
1993 of the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and
Resolution in Africa.
</P>
<P>
A statement from Zimbabwean defense forces headquarters today
said that host president and OAU chairman Robert Mugabe is
expected to open the three-day meeting while the continental
body's Secretary-general Salim Ahmed Salim will deliver the
keynote address.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe and Salim will highlight the need for Africa to resolve
the problem of endemic military coups, secessionism, genocide and
many other ills that bedevil the continent, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"Because the issues at hand are crucial and very topical, the
general secretariat of the OAU decided that all member states
should be invited. Thus, all the 53 member states will be
expected to be represented," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Africa has awakened to the message that it must be seen to be
taking the lead in resolving African problems," the statement
said.

<HEADLINE> EU not to Give up its Role in Mideast: Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) would not
give up its role in the Mideast peace process and the role was not
subject to reconsideration, EU special envoy to the Middle East
Miguel Angel Moratinos was quoted today as saying.
</P>
<P>
The EU defends its interests in the region with the spirit of
partnership and solidarity and "we create more favorable
political and economic environment and brighter prospects for the
relations between Europe and its neighbors," local daily
Assabah today quoted Moratinos as saying.
</P>
<P>
The commitment of the concerned parties in the Middle East
peace process is unrevocable, said the EU official who arrived
here early this week to exchange views with Tunisian leaders on
ways of reviving the peace process stalemated by the
uncompromising policy of the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
However, the Israeli government led by Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu is clearly concentrating on the security aspects, he
said, adding that the concerned parties have to give higher
priority to defusing the tension in the security area.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos urged for the adoption of new approach to security
that is more realistic and viable and depends on the fact that the
more progress is made in the peace process the more security is
attained.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he denied that the recent difficulties in the peace
process have weakened the position of Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
"On the contrary, Arafat is still an active element in the
Palestinian society and he is the only one who can okay a final
accord with Israel," Moratinos said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Able to Produce Missile Launching Boats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Iran today claimed that it is
capable of designing and producing small missile launching boats
and moving closer to building small tactical submarines.
</P>
<P>
Admiral Ali Akbar Ahmadian said the Islamic Revolutionary Guard
Corps (IRGC) naval force has made strides toward self-sufficiency
by obtaining up-to-date knowledge in designing, upgrading and
manufacturing modern vessels.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that the commander of
the IRGC naval force made the statement at the "Piroozi (Victory)
8" exercises zone near the southern port city of Bushehr.
</P>
<P>
"The new missile launching boats would be deployed in the next
joint military exercises code-named "Piroozi 9," he was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The admiral said that apart from designing and manufacturing
small missile launching boats, considerable progress has been made
in producing small tactical submarines as well.
</P>
<P>
He said that the missile system had turned Iran into the
strongest missile power in the region and the upgraded missile
systems of his force have been successfully tested in the
exercises from October 11 to 17 that hypothesized every condition
of a modern missile warfare.
</P>
<P>
He said the drilling troops carried out joint missions using
small missile launching boats and IRGC missile sites with complete
success.
</P>
<P>
He added that the shifting of missile sites, radar and modern
communications tests, air and missile launching operations,
expanding missile sites and testing of upgraded missile systems
were included in the exercises.

<HEADLINE> HK To Promote Business Ties with Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Trade
Development Council (TDC) will hold a series of activities to
promote business ties between Hong Kong and Europe during Chief
Executive Tung Chee-hwa's visit to Europe on October 19-23.
</P>
<P>
A highlight of the European mission will be the inauguration of
the Hong Kong/European Union and European Union/Hong Kong Business
Cooperation Committees, a bilateral initiative spearheaded by the
TDC.
</P>
<P>
Tung Chee-hwa, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) of China, will deliver an opening
address at the first plenary session of the committees, to be held
on October 20 in Brussels, the first leg of Tung's European tour.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Committee is chaired by TDC Chairman Victor
Fung. The EU Committee is chaired by Chairman of Godman Sachs
International Peter Sutherland, who is former director-general of
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Committee
members are all corporate leaders of the most important
manufacturing and service industries from both regions.

together from across Europe to hear about latest developments in
Hong Kong and opportunities for closer business ties.

<P>
The TDC's long-established Annual Dinner in London will be held
on October 21. British government leaders will be among the 400
guests. London is the second leg of Tung's European tour.
</P>
<P>
The London Dinner, one of the TDC's most successful channels
for high-level networking, plays a particular important role in
strengthening links between the financial services sectors of Hong
Kong and the city of London.
</P>
<P>
"The European Union is Hong Kong's third largest trading
partner. Expanding the partnership with Europe is very important
to our role as Asia's hub for international business," said TDC
Chairman Victor Fung.

<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Li Lanqing, in a
trip to the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region last week, said that
areas inhabited by ethnic minority people need to develop their
economy through science and education.
</P>
<P>
"The ethnic minority areas should speed up reforms and
opening-up under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory, under the
leadership of the Communist Party of China Central Committee with
Jiang Zemin at the core," said Li, who is also a Standing
Committee member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of
China Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
The region has made great social and economic progress in the
past several years, and that maintaining sound economic
development and social stability in the Inner Mongolian Autonomous
Region is vital to China's development and stability, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li visited some large state-owned enterprises and local
universities in the company of Uliji, deputy secretary of the CPC
Inner Mongolia Regional Committee and chairman of the Inner
Mongolian Autonomous Region government, and others.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Security Tightened in Southern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Philippine police authorities,
alarmed by Tuesday's terrorist attack on a military camp, decided
to seal off the southern provinces of Sulu and Tawi-Tawi to
prevent undocumented foreigners from entering the country.
</P>
<P>
Chief Superintendent Franco Calida, police director of the
Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), issued the order to
isolate the two provinces, seen as the country's backdoor, the
Philippine News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Calida said the move is aimed to prevent a repeat of Tuesday's
suicide attack on Camp Siongco, the Army's Sixth Infantry Division
headquarters, located in Sinsuat town, Maguindanao province in
central Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
During the attack, two suspected Muslim extremists, one
Pakistani and one Saudi Arabian, entered Camp Siongco, and shot
dead three soldiers before they themselves were killed.
</P>
<P>
The two attackers were accompanied by two Filipino companions
who acted as lookouts at the gate and escaped.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Calida also enforced a local authentication process
for foreigners to determine the legality of their stay in the two
isolated island provinces.
</P>
<P>
Calida explained that the process is not aimed at "harassing"
foreigners but to know the purpose of their stay in the country.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners who do not have appropriate travel documents will be
handed over to the Bureau of Immigration and Deportation.
</P>
<P>
Most foreigners present in Tawi-Tawi and Sulu are reportedly
Pakistani and Egyptian missionaries teaching Islam to local
residents.
</P>
<P>
Both the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and Abu Sayyaf,
the country's two remaining Muslim rebel groups, have strongly
denied involvement in the attack.
</P>
<P>
The main rebel faction, the Moro National Liberation Front,
signed a peace accord with the government last year.

<HEADLINE> Chen Yan Strikes Fourth Swimming Gold at National Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Chen Yan, who has broken two
world records and reapt three golds in the swimming pool, won her
fourth title in the women's 800 meters freestyle at the Eighth
National Games here Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
Chen clocked an Asian record-breaking time of eight minutes
27.94 seconds for the gold, followed by Chen Hua of Zhejiang
province in 8:32.11 and Jiangxi's Luo Ping in 8:36.19.
</P>
<P>
Chen also anchored her Liaoning teammates for a silver in the
women's 4X200m freestyle relay. But the medal was disqualified
later because of a start fault.
</P>
<P>
The relay event was won by the local foursome in 7:58.60.
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old teenage sensation failed to qualify for the
finals of the 200m backstroke after finishing last in her group in
heats this morning.
</P>
<P>
"I had to give up one of the two events," she said. "Or I will
lose both."
</P>
<P>
The relay was the last event the Liaoning star competed in the
National Games, which will end its swimming competition on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy to win four gold medals at the Games," Chen
said. "After all, it is held only every four years."
</P>
<P>
With the most glittering feat at the Games, the teenager now
sets her sights upon the World Swimming Championships slated next
January in Perth, Australia.
</P>
<P>
"I will try my best to achieve good results there," she said.
"I will resume training as soon as possible after the Games."
</P>
<P>
But jumping to stardom at an early age of 16, she inevitably
raised concerns that she might meet more pressures in mind in the
future international competitions.
</P>
<P>
"Pressure? Yes, it is unavoidable. But I'll try not to think
about it," she said.
</P>
<P>
Zhen Yinjuan, gold medalist in the women's 100m backstroke,
proved her status as a backstroke queen by grabbing the 200m gold
in 2:08.51.
</P>
<P>
"It is just a beginning, I hope I can do better in the Swimming
Worlds in Perth," the Guangdong native said.
</P>
<P>
"She has trained very hard in the past year for the Games," her
coach Wu Jinpei said. "She often spent extra time in training by
herself."
</P>
<P>
He Cihong of the Chinese Army, world record holder in the
women's 100m backstroke, was beaten into second place in 2:10.21,
0.50 seconds ahead of third placer Wu Yanyan of Guangxi, who set a
world record in the women's 200m individual medley on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In the men's 50m freestyle, local hero Jiang Chengji, who
finished a record fourth place in the Atlanta Olympic Games,
captured the title in 22.54 seconds, the fifth gold he won in the
National Games.
</P>
<P>
The men's 200m individual medley gold went to Shanghai's Wang
Wei, who touched home first with a new Asian record of 2:02.36.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 18 (Xinhua)-- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today concluded a two-day state visit to Laos, in which five
agreements were signed, and both sides called the trip a
"historical event" for bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Ramos, the first Philippine head of state to visit the Lao
People's Democratic Republic since its foundation, arrived in the
capital, Vientiane, Friday.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, he held talks with Lao President Nouhak
Phoumsavanh and Prime Minister Khamtay Siphandone in "an
atmosphere of friendship and frankness," a joint press communique
said.
</P>
<P>
It said both sides reviewed and highly appreciated the growing
friendship and cooperation, and agreed to further ties in the
future.
</P>
<P>
The visit was "an historical event, opening a new era of closer
friendship and strengthened co-operation between Laos and the
Philippines," the communique said.
</P>
<P>
Both sides hoped to contribute to regional stability and
prosperity and to the progress and well-being of their people
through closer partnership and cooperation.

They discussed the possibility of creating a "growth polygon,"
encompassing the northwest and southwest Philippines, Laos,
northeast Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia in line with ASEAN's
thrust to encourage creation of sub-regional growth centers.
</P>
<P>
The visit also resulted in five documents, including the
exemption of visas for holders of official passports, co-operation
against illicit trafficking and abuses of narcotics drugs and
psychotropic substances.

<HEADLINE> AL Undecided on Whether to Go to Doha Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) Secretary
General Esmat Abdul-Meguid said here today that the league has yet
to decide if it will take part in the fourth Middle East and North
Africa economic conference slated for November 16-18 in Qatar.
</P>
<P>
"The Arab League has not yet determined its stance. Contacts
are still under way in this respect," the AL chief said before
heading for Beirut to attend the 7th conference of Arab
businessmen and investors, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The 22-member Arab League has received an invitation from the
host Qatar. But it conditioned its participate on progress in the
Mideast peace process, putting pressure on Israel to change its
hardline policies.
</P>
<P>
The peace process came to a halt in March after Israel
obstinately went ahead with the building of a Jewish settlement in
Arab East Jerusalem despite world outcry.
</P>
<P>
Many Arab countries have either rejected or threatened to
boycott the Doha conference which is to include Israel. But Qatar
said it expects 82 countries, including 12 Arab countries, at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
According to Abdul-Meguid, the conference in Lebanon organized
by the AL and the Arab Institution for Investment Guarantees is
aimed at attracting investment funds to the Arab world and
encouraging Arab cooperation in economic and trade fields.
</P>
<P>
He said he will meet with Lebanese President Elias Hrawi, Prime
Minister Rafik Hariri, Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri and a number
of senior Arab officials in Beirut.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Mandela's Visit to Libya Evokes Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 18 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela has been criticized by opposition parties and the
United States for his decision to visit Libya.
</P>
<P>
Announcing Mandela's tour this week, the Department of Foreign
Affairs of South Africa said Mandela would visit Libya and Egypt
en route to the Commonwealth summit in Edinburgh from October 24
to 27.
</P>
<P>
"Libya is a country which was very supportive of the South
African liberation struggle against apartheid, and is one of the
countries that the president has not visited since his
inauguration," the department said.
</P>
<P>
It said relations and bilateral trade between the two sides
have been on a sound footing since South Africa's democratic
elections in 1994.
</P>
<P>
But the United States has expressed its "disapproval" of the
visit. State Department spokesman James Foley said his country
"believes" that diplomatic contacts with Libya "ought to be
maintained at a low level", and "we would be disappointed with a
visit of any head of state."
</P>
<P>
He said, according to U.N Security Council resolutions 748 and
883, flights into Tripoli, capital of Libya, are a violation of
sanctions, and that would be "a very special concern".
</P>
<P>
Responding to U.S. pressure, South African foreign affairs
spokesman Peter Swanepoel said Mandela would be travelling by
road to Tripoli and would not be violating U.N. sanctions against
Libya by flying to Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
Nor would Mandela's visit affect relations with the United
States, which regards Libya as a sponsor of international
terrorism, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
However, South Africa's National Party spokesman Boy
Geldenhuys said Mandela should cancel his visit to Libya as it
would cause serious detrimental consequences for South Africa's
national interests.
</P>
<P>
Not only would the visit put South Africa on a collision
course with the international politics, it could also be damaging
to the country's relations with the United States, he claimed.
</P>
<P>
According to the opposition party's position, the U.S. is by
far the largest donor of development aid to South Africa, and if
that tap was turned off, the under-developed communities would be
the ones to suffer.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's Democratic Party leader Tony Leon said
Mandela's decision was to "cock a snook" at world opinion.
</P>
<P>
"It does the ANC (African National Congress) no credit that
some of its main supporters during the years of apartheid were
pariah nations like Cuba and Libya, whose commitment to human
rights leaves much to be desired," claimed the opposition leader.
</P>
<P>
But the ANC has said it will continue to develop South
Africa's relations and cooperations with Libya and Cuba, as well
as Iran.
</P>
<P>
The foreign affairs spokesman also said that while South
Africa was well aware of the U.S. position, it also had bilateral
relations with Libya, a fellow member of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) and of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM).
</P>
<P>
The government did not believe that Mandela's visit to Libya
would affect South Africa's relations with the United States, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Libya has been embroiled in a row with Britain and the U.S.
over its refusal to extradite two suspects for the bombing of a
Pan-Am jetliner over Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
Libya, backed by the OAU and NAM, has suggested a compromise,
calling for the trial to be held in a neutral country, by
Scottish judges under Scottish law. The matter is now before the
International Court.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Mandela will try to broker some sort of
resolution to this matter during his visit to Libya.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique to Maintain Current Export Duty of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Minister of
Industry, Trade and Tourism Oldemiro Baloi announced here on
Friday that the government will keep the 14 percent export duty
of raw cashew nut unchanged for at least the next three years.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican government made the decision after considering
a study on Mozambique's cashew nut production and procession by
an international consultancy, views and suggestions from the
cashew nut industry, the World Bank and other organizations,
local paper "Noticias" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The export duty of cashew nut should be paid on the export day
by exporters, according to the government decision.
</P>
<P>
A cashew association will also be set up to replace the
Secretariat of State for Cashew Nut and it will be given more
power to intervene cashew nut production, procession and export.
</P>
<P>
The output of cashew nuts in Mozambique was once on the top in
the world, with the highest record of 220,000 tons. But it only
produced 60,000 tons of cashew nuts last year.

<P>
NANJING, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Vice-President Rong Yiren, a
non-Communist state leader, has urged people to follow Deng
Xiaoping Theory in all areas.
</P>
<P>
It is important to hold the banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory high
as proposed by the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central
Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core, Rong said during an tour
of Wuxi, an industrial city in eastern Jiangsu Province, in the
past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, Rong visited villages, enterprises, schools,
and environmental and infrastructure projects. In talks with local
officials, he praised the substantial progress made by Wuxi in
agricultural modernization. He quoted Jiang Zemin as saying that
agriculture should be given top priority in all economic issues.
</P>
<P>
He asked that the problem of too many laborers in the
countryside be dealt with, emphasizing its importance in social
stability.
</P>
<P>
He also paid special attention to environmental protection
measures of the local government dealing with severe pollutions in
Taihu Lake.

<HEADLINE> Cholera Bacteria Found in S. African River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Alarm has rung for local
residents when tests showed that the Klip River bordering South
Africa's Free State and Mpumalanga provinces was contaminated
with cholera-causing bacteria.
</P>
<P>
Results of the tests revealed on Friday showed that the water
samples contained two infective cholera-causing sub-species,
local meidia reported.
</P>
<P>
Health experts said that owing to the presence of the two
sub-species, there is a 99 percent chance that some people would
become carriers of the intestinal disease and others may become
sick and die.
</P>
<P>
Cholera is a bacterial disease, spread mainly through
contaminated water, that causes severe diarrhea and vomiting and
rapid dehydration. Patients can recover within 24 hours if
treated immediately after diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
Gauteng's Health department was alerting hospitals and clinics
to test all patients with severe diarrhea for cholera from
Friday, and were hurriedly putting together brochures for an
information campaign to prevent the potentially fatal disease.
</P>
<P>
They have been expecting the arrival of cholera in South
Africa since the disease broke out in Mozambique about a month
ago. The government in Kenya, where a cholera outbreak killed 140
people this year, has appealed to the World Health Organization
for help.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2,500 people have been taken to hospital since
cholera first broke out in that country eight months ago.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's drinking water supplier, Rand Water, has
launched a massive education campaign aimed at preventing a
possible outbreak of cholera in the contaminated area. Leaflets
were delivered to schools, clinics and shops.
</P>
<P>
Rand Water warned residents along the Klip River to avoid
contact with the river water and watch for early symptoms of
cholera.

<P>
Doctors in the area have been told to treat every case of
diarrhea as a possible cholera case.
</P>
<P>
The contamination of the Klip River reportedly stems from
sewerage and industrial effluent discharged in rivers.
</P>
<P>
Water Affairs spokesman Marius Keet said his department was
working on pinpointing the culprits responsible for the
pollution, before forcing companies to clean up the river.
</P>
<P>
The results of the tests sparked a wave of panic among
residents along the Klip River. They are poised to sue Water
Affairs Minister Kader Asmal, unless his department forces
sewerage works to clean up the river immediately.

<HEADLINE> Cholera Outbreak Kills Hundreds in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 18 (Xinhua) -- An outbreak of cholera has
killed hundreds of people in Nigeria in the last three months,
This Day newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said the epidemic was first spotted in the north,
when it claimed unspecified number of residents in the Kano city,
including students at the Bayero University in Kano City.
</P>
<P>
Since then, it has forced the closure of the university and
appears to be spreading fast to other parts of the country, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
According to it, several slum areas in the Lagos State,
including Amukoko, Ajegunle and Alaba are worst hit by the
disease, as residents there have been supplied with reddish water
in the last few months.
</P>
<P>
It quoted state water corporation sources as saying that the
water supply pipe in the areas have been damaged during road
construction.
</P>
<P>
Health experts have blamed on the outbreak on unhygienic
environment, dirty preparation and handling of food and water,
and transmission through victims.
</P>
<P>
They called for the education of the public on the disease's
transmission and on how to keep good personal hygienic habits.
They also called for an earlier warning system and improved
immunization services.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Demographers Say Community Important In Family Planning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Some Chinese demographers are
suggesting that family planning work in China's rural areas should
be tied to rural community development for better results.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Peng Xizhe, director of Fudan University's Population
Research Institute, says that community-based rural development
has proven effective in getting farmers to be more enthusiastic
about family planning.
</P>
<P>
As the basic social unit of economic affairs and welfare
programs, the rural community, either a village or a town, may
strongly influence couples or individuals in the process of family
decision-making, he explains.
</P>
<P>
If a well-developed community can provide business
opportunities, and better cultural, health, and welfare services
for farmers, they will be more willing to accept family planning
policy, he says.
</P>
<P>
Peng's opinion is shared by his colleague, Prof. Dai Xingyi,
who took part in a research program titled "Network for Community
Based Development and Family Planning".
</P>
<P>
China's rural areas have more than 700 million people, and
have been vital to population-control efforts since the late
1970s. However, an under-developed economy and some deep-rooted
outdated concepts have remained major obstacles.
</P>
<P>
The government has recently called for integrating the rural
family planning program with economic development and farmer
assistance in business.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese rural residents are quite practical," says Prof. Li
Jingneng with Nankai University's Population Research
Institute. "If they are free of worries in their lives, health
care, and social welfare, they can be persuaded and do it on their
own."
</P>
<P>
"Although the community model is still at the experimental
stage, I think it is a very good direction and will be promising,"
Peng says.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Lawmakers Examine Water Law's Effects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, October 18 (Xinhua) -- A vice-chairman of the
Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress has urged
government to fight flooding and water pollution.
</P>
<P>
Wang Bingqian said that the work to control rivers, find water
resources and control flooding should be in concert with water and
soil conservation and water pollution control.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the remarks today in the capital of Hunan Province,
while inspecting the implementation of the Water Law there.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that water resource shortages, pollution, wasted
water resources, and flooding are still serious, even though there
have been some good results in conservation and protection of
water resources since the law went into effect in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Water resource departments should be more open-minded and
utilize foreign funds boldly and rationally, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The 13-day inspection was near Dongting Lake, China's second
largest, which is a crucial flood prevention and protection area
on the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Yang Zhenhuai, a member of the NPC Standing Committee and
co-chairman of the NPC Environmental and Resources Protection
Committee, urged Hunan's government to more conscientiously
implement the Water Law.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria, IMF At Odds on Loan Terms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria has disagreed with the
International Monetary Fund's (IMF) request to reduce the
country's budget deficit in 1998 to zero and to contain wages rise
at 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations between Muravei Radev, Bulgarian minister of
finance and the IMF representative over the past days on the loans
provided by the IMF to Bulgaria did not process smoothly, said a
press report.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria and the IMF reached a series of agreements in March,
under which Bulgaria was provided with loans of 650 million
U.S. dollars, and in return would conform with some restrictions
imposed by the IMF on macroscopic economic indexes.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria, which considered the terms raised by the IMF on the
deficit too harsh, only agreed to first slash the deficit to 25
percent of the gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian government had planned to raise wages by 40
percent next year, as against 36 percent set by the IMF which
translates into an average monthly salary of 173,000 levs (about
100 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The IMF strictly reviewed Bulgaria's financial directorate
before each loan was granted. The loans actually granted so far
have accounted for less than one-third of the contract loans.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria registered its worst economic performance yet in 1996,
with a 9 percent drop in GDP, 311 percent inflation, and a 600
percent devaluation of the lev.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister of Antigua and
Barbuda Lester Bird started a two-day private visit to Macao today
following his official trip to China's inland areas.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister was greeted by Wang Qiren, director of the
Xinhua News Agency Macao Branch, when he arrived via Zhuhai city,
south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Wang congratulated him on his successful visit to China's
inland areas, and said that bilateral friendship and cooperation
will keep growing since the two countries are both developing
nations and share many things in common.
</P>
<P>
Bird expressed congratulations on China's resumption of
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong this year. He also wished a
smooth transition and handover of power in Macao in 1999.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the prime minister said that he hopes to visit
Macao again after China's resumption of exercise of sovereignty
over Macao, adding that he also hopes to establish a consulate in
Macao in the future.
</P>
<P>
Wang briefed Bird on Macao's transition and the Chinese
government's policy on Macao, saying that a stable transition and
a smooth handover of power will be achieved under the policy of
"one country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of China's Premier Li Peng, Bird and his
entourage arrived in Beijing on October 13 for an official
visit. It was his second visit in 13 years.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in China's inland areas, he held talks with Li
Peng and met with other senior Chinese leaders in Beijing, and

<HEADLINE> HK Entertainers Plan Theme Restaurants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 18 (Xinhua) -- A group of local
show-business personalities is starting a business to franchise
entertainment-theme restaurants worldwide, a concept similar to
Planet Hollywood, according to local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
The Star East restaurant concept boasts over 40 celebrity
investors including kung fu superstar Jackie Chan, singers Anita
Mui Yim-fong and game-show host Eric Tsang Chi-wei, with singer
Alan Tam Wing-lun serving as chairman.
</P>
<P>
The theme restaurants will serve Asian food to set them apart
from Planet Hollywood invested by a host of Hollywood stars.
</P>
<P>
According to the business's chief financial controller David
Eng, Star East plans to operate about 20 restaurants within two
years through franchise agreements, with start-up cost for each
restaurant estimated at 50 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The first franchised restaurant will be opened on November 1 in
Guangzhou, China's Guangdong Province bordering Hong Kong,
followed by another in Los Angeles next March.
</P>
<P>
Other target places include Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore,
Malaysia as well as other major cities in China's interior areas.
</P>
<P>
Eng said the group plans to float their business in three
years.

<HEADLINE> Revised Guideline for HK Banks To Fight Money Laundering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Those who launder money using
shell companies, trusts and nominee accounts in Hong Kong will
have a harder time under a revised guideline issued to banks,
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The guideline, issued Thursday by the Hong Kong Monetary
Authority (HKMA), strengthens the customer identification
requirements when accounts were opened, to find out the real
person behind the corporate facades.
</P>
<P>
The revised guideline, replacing the previous one issued in
July 1993, has taken into account legal changes since then,
including the passage of the Organized and Serious Crimes
Ordinance in 1994 which extends the money laundering offense to
the proceeds of serious crimes other than drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The new guideline is in line with the latest recommendations of
the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an international
organization aimed at strengthening global cooperation against
money laundering.
</P>
<P>
"The HKMA takes very seriously the need to prevent use of the
banking system for the purposes of money laundering," said a HKMA
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He added that the guideline will "help to maintain the
reputation and credibility of Hong Kong as an international
financial center."

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Prudence Bank Shut Immediately </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's Prudence Bank will be
shut today with immediate effect due to "unsatisfactory"
compliance with the directives of Bank of Zambia, the country's
central bank, to improve its management.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with Xinhua, Kabinga Pande, manager
of public relations at Bank of Zambia, confirmed that all branch
offices of Prudence Bank will stop business from now on until
further notice.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has in the meantime taken control and
possession of the bank in order to safeguard the interests of
depositors and the financial system, according to Panda.
</P>
<P>
However, Panda did not give further details about the bank's
mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
Last month, senior management staff and directors at Prudence
Bank were removed from their positions through an order from the
Minister of Finance Ronald Penza following their "unsatisfactory"
compliance with orders given by the central bank to try and
improve operations at the institution.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has appointed one of its senior personnel as
the overall manager of Prudence Bank in order to continue with
its management.
</P>
<P>
Prudence Bank suffered another set-back earlier last month
after its head office went up in flames in an "inferno" which
gutted a 19-floor building in Lusaka's downtown.

<HEADLINE> Tens of Thousands of Traffic Law Offenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 18 (Xinhua) -- South African traffic
authorities have achieved preliminary result since the start of
the Arrive Alive Campaign on October 1, local daily "Saturday
Star" reported today.
</P>
<P>
In Gauteng Province alone, traffic officials have charged
135,640 drivers for offences ranging from failure to wear a
seatbelt to drunken driving, the report said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is administratively divided into nine provinces.
Gauteng Province has the worst road safety record in the country.
</P>
<P>
Gauteng Transport Department authorities said earlier that the
campaign would intensify and by the end of this month, mobile
courts would be in place at roadblocks to ensure that suspects
were dealt with swiftly.
</P>
<P>
"The local authorities are doing their best to ensure that
motorists will abide by the rules and law-abiding citizens will
finally feel safe on the roads," said a department spokesman Delc
Maluleke.
</P>
<P>
Traffic authorities in provinces of KwaZulu Natal and the
Western Cape, where the campaign is also under way, have reported
similar successes, and numerous road blocks have been held in
those provinces.
</P>
<P>
Traffic disorders, including reckless driving, drunk-driving
and exceeding the speed limit, have been one of serious social
problems in South Africa, which have cost the South African
economy close to 12 billion Rand (2.55 billion U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Arrive Alive Campaign will run until January and will be
focused on Gauteng, KwaZulu Natal and the Western Cape, where 76
percent of all accidents on South African roads occur. It is the
largest co-ordinated action taken against traffic offenders in
the country.

with Australia in the Champions Trophy men's field hockey Sunday
after defeating Spain 3-2 Saturday in Adelaide, Australia.
</P>
<P>
Germany had to win to progress to the final before the match,
while Spain, on equal points with the Germans but higher on goal
difference, only needed to draw.
</P>
<P>
The Germans took an early lead with a backstick field goal by
captain Christian Blunck in the eighth minute, after they missed
their chance in two penalty corners.
</P>
<P>
Spain hit back in the 19th minute with a goal by gutsy forward
Javier Arnau, his seventh in the tournament, to level the score at
halftime.
</P>
<P>
But Germany scored quickly in the second half, with a field
goal from Christoph Eimer and then one from Oliver Domke, aided by
some smart defender-dodging of Philipp Crone.
</P>
<P>
Spain's final goal, in the form of a waist high deflection by
Victor Pujol into the back of the net, was not enough to get it
through.
</P>
<P>
In day's other match, the Netherlands beat Pakistan 5-2 and
will play Spain Saturday for third and fourth places.
</P>
<P>
Also Saturday, Australia, which had already qualified, swamped
the South Korea 6-1 for its fifth straight win in the six-nation
tournament.

<HEADLINE> Solidarity Union Veteran Named New Polish PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Polish President Aleksander
Kwasniewski Friday appointed Jerzy Buzek, a Solidarity Union
veteran and chemistry professor, as Poland's new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Buzek, nominated earlier this week by Solidarity Election
Action (AWS) and its coalition partner, the Freedom Union (UW), is
expected to form a center-right cabinet in 14 days.
</P>
<P>
His appointment came after the resignation earlier Friday of
the the leftist government led by Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz, whose
Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) lost majority in the parliament in
the September 21 election.
</P>
<P>
Cimoszewicz's SLD, allied with the Peasant Party, has been in
power since 1993.
</P>
<P>
Though some successes have been achieved in economic reforms
over the past four years, the Polish public has become unsatisfied
with worsening social problems. The frequent reshuffle of the
leftist coalition also dampened its image.
</P>
<P>
In last month's election, the AWS secured 33.8 percent of the
vote, beating the ruling SLD by a margin of 6.7 percentage points,
to become the biggest party in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The AWS has been negotiating with the Freedom Union since the
election to form a coalition, and the little-known Buzek was
presented as a candidate for prime minister after Solidarity chief
Marian Krzaklewski refused to take the premiership himself.
</P>
<P>
Buzek, 57, once a researcher at the Institute of Chemical
Engineering under the Polish Academy of Sciences, joined the
Solidarity when it is founded in 1980.
</P>
<P>
However, he was not a prominent politician before being elected
member of the parliament in September.
</P>
<P>
After his nomination, Buzek said the new government's
priorities will include developing economy under social
stabilization, and seeding up negotiations of Poland's entry into
the NATO and the European Union.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: As Ross Comes, Israel, PNA Have Differing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 18 (Xinhua) -- As Israel and the
Palestinians await United States peace envoy Dennis Ross' visit,
they have one thing in common - hoping the envoy would pressure
the other side into making concessions.
</P>
<P>
Aside from this, however, their expectations for Ross'
mediation mission are generally differing, perhaps as wide as they
used to be.
</P>
<P>
Ross is due here Sunday in a new bid to advance the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process which had just jump started
following a seven-month freeze. But progress seems hard to come by.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming Ross' return to the region, the Palestinian
Legislative Council on Friday said it expected that Ross would
shift his focus from Palestinian National Authority's (PNA)
crackdown on Islamic militants to halting Israeli settlement
activities.
</P>
<P>
Senior PNA negotiator Saeb Erekat said Ross should deliver on
the agenda that the PNA agreed with U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright during her visit here last month and on an end
to Israel's "unilateral steps," including settlement expansion,
confiscation of Palestinian land and demolition of Palestinian
homes.
</P>
<P>
Erekat also demanded Israel proceed with the scheduled further
troop redeployments in the West Bank in accordance with signed
agreements.
</P>
<P>
Under a Note for Record attached to the Hebron redeployment
deal signed in January, Israel should have completed the first two
of the three-phase redeployments in the West Bank by early
September.
</P>
<P>
But the pullbacks were never carried out because the PNA
refused to accept Israel's unilateral definition of the scope of
troop evacuation. Israel offered to pull out of 2 percent of the
West Bank in the first stage in March, far below what the PNA
expected.
</P>
<P>
Israel, on the other hand, hopes Ross will force the PNA into
waging a consistent war against Islamic militant groups dedicated
to terror attacks on Israel. The Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas,
for example, is responsible for the two latest suicide attacks in
Jerusalem which killed 25 people and wounded more than 300 others.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was quoted by Israel
Radio as saying today that Israel will not hand over more land to
the PNA unless he is satisfied with the PNA's fight against
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
His media adviser, David Bar-Illan, said that top on the agenda
should be the discussion on the PNA's "failure" to take real
actions to dismantle the infrastructure of Islamic militant groups.
</P>
<P>
On the settlement issue, Bar-Illan said Israel was willing to
discuss the definition of "time-out" as called for by
Albright. Moreover, the two sides would also discuss Israel's
proposal for conducting the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
Israel aspires to open the final-status talks immediately,on
the most sensitive issues of Jerusalem, final borders and return
of Palestinian refugees, because this will give it more bargaining
chips by skipping troop redeployments under the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
Israeli settlement activities have been the leading obstacle
to any progress in the peace process; the success of Ross' mission
and the Israeli-Palestinian talks seems largely contingent on whether
Israel is willingness to call a freeze.

<HEADLINE> Ma's New Protege Threats World Record in 1,500 meters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Bom, new protege of
China's famous track coach Ma Junren, launched her fierce attacks
against the world record by clocking three minutes 50.98 seconds
in the women's 1,500 meters here Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Her winning mark at the on-going National Games was only 0.52
seconds short of the world mark of 3:50.46 set by her teammate Qu
Yunxia four years ago in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"I am surprised to win the gold because I only competed in the
National Games as a substitute," said the 20-year-old runner at
the post-match press conference.
</P>
<P>
"Although we (Liaoning) had eight runners in the finals, we did
not set up any tactics, and I encouraged myself to run my best,"
said Jiang, who became one of the most promising runners within
Ma's Family after Wang Junxia and Liu Dong broke away from the
controversial coach in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"I dedicated my gold to coach Ma," said Jiang, "he was very
strick in our training, but very kind and careful in taking care
of our lives off the track."
</P>
<P>
All the top six places were swept by Ma's disiciples while
world record-holder Qu Yunxia finished in the eighth place after
she was elbowed to the floor in the 300-meter mark.
</P>
<P>
Li Xuemei of Sichuan province run her best of 10.79 seconds to
beat her newly-created Asian mark of 10.90 set up in the heats on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I am very, very surprised to break the Asian record as I would
feel satisfied to finish within the top three," said the
20-year-old sprinter who clocked 10.90 seconds in the heats to
better the Asian mark of 11.02 set up by Liu Xiaomei four years
ago in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"I had no secrets in improving my speed except through hard
training," said Li who made her international debut in the World
Athletics Championships in Greece in August wherein she failed to
make the finals.
</P>
<P>
"I was relatively weak in the starting-off and I have paid keen
attention upon it in my training," said Li.
</P>
<P>
Former Asian record holder Liu Xiaomei of Sichuan finished
second in 10.89, also surpassing the previous Asian mark.
</P>
<P>
The women's 100-meter hurdle was won by another Sichuan entry
of Zeng Yan who clocked 12.74 seconds, beating teammate Liu Jing
to second in 12.76 and national-record holder Zhang Yu to third in
12.84.
</P>
<P>
Li Jin of Liaoning province clocked 50.01 seconds to win the
women's 400-meter title, beating veteran Du Xiujie of Guangdong to
second in 50.87.
</P>
<P>
The men's 100-meter title was taken by Zhou Wei of Guangdong
province in 10.22, while a national record was set up in the men's
400-meter finals which was won by Han Chaoming of Guangdong in
45.46 seconds which overpassed the previous mark of 45.85.
</P>
<P>
National champion Song Mingyou of Shandong province beat two
rivals from Liaoning to retain his title by clocking 2:36.54 in
the men's 1,500 meters.
</P>
<P>
All the seven finishers in the event surpassed the listed
national record of 3:40.93 set up by Mo Weiguo at the Hiroshima
Asian Games in 1994.

<P>
Among new orders this year, 190 were for the A319, A320 and
A321 models, and 52 were for the A330/A340 long-haul versions.

<HEADLINE> Ma Junren Angry at Slip of World Records in National Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Aiming to break the world
records in the women's 1,500 meters, Chinese legendary coach Ma
Junren kept complaining of a "plot" conducted by rivals of his
proteges in the track competitions here Saturday afternoon at the
Eighth National Games.
</P>
<P>
"Without the accident, three of my disciples were sure to break
the world record. It's a pity for Liaoning, and a pity for China,"
complained coach Ma Junren who sat in the stands with a watch in
his hands during the competitions.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Bo, one of Ma's promising runners, clocked three minutes
50.98 seconds to take the title, with only 0.52 seconds shy of the
world record of 3:50.46.
</P>
<P>
World record holder Qu Yunxia accidently fell to the track in
the 300-meter mark in a body conflict with runners from Henan
province, distracting the attention of other runners, including
Ma's seven proteges in the 12-member finals.
</P>
<P>
"It's a plot of those opponents to stop my disciples from
breaking the world record," coach Ma shouted in his hoarse voice
to reporters who eventually spotted out the lengendary coach in
the stands.
</P>
<P>
The top six places were all swept by his proteges of Ma's
Family, and Qu Yunxia still finished eighth in 3:57.83 after the
accident.
</P>
<P>
"Jiang Bo, Qu Yunxia and Lang Yinglai are the odds-on
candidates to break the world record in the finals," said coach Ma.
</P>
<P>
Despite of injuries, Qu Yunxia has retained her form in the
altitude training prior to the Games, Ma said.
</P>
<P>

separate press conference, saying "she (Qu) was better than me in
the training. For me, it's a surprise to win the title as I was
only a substitute before the National Games."

<P>
Although he kept a low-key note prior to the Games, few people
took seriously the words when Ma said he was only a chef and a

Olympic Games for a miracle.

<HEADLINE> EU Commission Supports Romania to Join the Bloc </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
will help Romania join the European Union (EU), a senior official
of the regional alliance said here today.
</P>
<P>
The EU's planned eastward expansion to include countries like
Romania is part of a historical process, said Hans Van Den Broek,
deputy president of the EC, the executive arm of the EU.
</P>
<P>
Van Den Broek made the remarks at a press conference after
meeting Romanian President Emil Constantinescu, Prime Minister
Victor Ciorbea and Foreign Minister Adrian Severin.
</P>
<P>
During talks with his hosts, said the EU official in charge of
East and Central European affairs, he called for speeding up
Romania's economic reforms to meet EU membership requirements.
</P>
<P>
The report "Agenda 2000," approved in July by the EC, doesn't
mean granting EU memberships to Romania, Hungary and the Czech
Republic in the first year of the next century, he said.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Van Den Broek told reporters, with the Romanian
foreign minister on his side, that the EU expansion is much of a
job likely to take seven to 10 years on the negotiation table.
</P>
<P>
Romania's formal request for an EU membership was submitted by
Foreign Minister Adrian Severin on June 22, 1995, after the
country was granted the status as an EU associate member.

<HEADLINE> Coca Cola Expects Full-Scale Growth in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Although most Chinese people
know Coca Cola, few know that the juice marked with "Tianyudi" is
also the product of Coca Cola company.
</P>
<P>
Actually, "Tianyudi" is Coca Cola's first local brand in China.
</P>
<P>
"The birth of the brand demonstrated that Coca Cola has
successfully transferred to China the world's most advanced
technology of soft drink making, and the company began to produce
drinks for the taste of Chinese consumers," said Steve Chan,
general manager of Coca Cola China.
</P>
<P>
Coca Cola has set up a special department to make research on
China market in order to develop beverage for Chinese
people. Canned Tea and soya-bean milk are the focus of the
department's research at present.
</P>
<P>
To make local brand products not only meet the demands of the
Chinese consumers and the diversified soft drink market of China,
but also demonstrated Coca Cola's resolve to continue cooperation
with the Chinese government and further develop in the country,
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua prior to Chinese President Jiang
Zemin's upcoming US visit, Chen said that the favorable
development trend of the Sino-US ties in recent years is what the
businesses communities of the two countries have expected, and
what Coca Cola has been working for.
</P>
<P>
The sound bilateral ties is the reason why Coca Cola is
confident of the China market, Chen said, adding that the
development strategy the Chinese government has drafted up made
the company feel that the future of China will be more stable and
it will develop more rapidly.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year development of Coca Cola in China also has made
Chen believe that Coca Cola will enjoy rapid development in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Coca Cola resumed its production in China in 1979, and
established its first bottler in Beijing two years later. Now,
there are 18 Coca Cola bottlers in China with total investment of
over 500 million US dollars. Its products occupied 26 percent of
of the China market. By the end of this year, Coca Cola will have
23 bottlers in China's 21 provinces and cities.
</P>
<P>
What made Chen proud of is that the development of Coca Cola in
China has always linked with the technological upgrading of
China's backward factories. Among its 23 bottlers, there are many
joint ventures between Coca Cola and obsolete state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
While developing in China's coastal region, Coca Cola also pays
attention to central and west China. It has opened office in
Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei Province, and established
bottlers in eight cities in central and west China.
</P>
<P>
Since the localization rate of Coca Cola's Chinese bottlers has
reached 98 percent, the company will purchase materials and
resources valued at three billion yuan RMB in China each year. The
move has stimulated the development of relevant industries in
China.

<HEADLINE> US Official's Visit to Pak Focuses on Pak-India Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The forthcoming visit to
Pakistan by U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs
Thomas Pickering will focus on Pakistani-Indian relations, the
Kashmir issue and Afghanistan, a Foreign Office spokesman said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Describing the visit as "an essential element of the renewed
American focus on South Asia", the Foreign Office spokesman said
that "the United States regards Kashmir a disputed territory and

with the wishes of the people of Jammu and Kashmir."
</P>
<P>
Pickering will be visiting Pakistan from October 18-21 for
comprehensive discussions with Pakistani Foreign Secretary
Shamshad Ahmad on bilateral matters as well as regional and global
issues of mutual interest, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"The United States has its own position and we appreciate the
fact that the United States considers Kashmir as a disputed
territory," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. under secretary of state is expected to call on
Pakistani President Farooq Leghari and Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"The relations between Pakistan and the United States have been
traditionally friendly and based on shared perceptions," the
Spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani foreign secretary and Pickering are expected to
review the "entire spectrum of Pakistan-US relations from a long
term perspective," he said.
</P>
<P>

bilateral ties in multiple fields with a special focus on mutually
beneficial economic cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Food Aid Sent to Southern Sudan's Juba City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 18 (Xinhua) -- A convoy of barges chartered
by the World Food Program (WFP) left Malakal this week with
urgently needed food aid for Juba, the largest city in the
war-torn southern Sudan, said a WFP report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The WFP barge convoy to Juba is the first to the city this
year and came after months of delays largely due to insecurity in
the region and particularly along the Nile River, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
The convoy, carrying a total of 2,664 tons of food aid, is
expected to reach its final destination in mid November.
</P>
<P>
A WFP team aboard the barge will distribute the food aid along
the Nile River and cross frontlines to reach about 374,000 hungry
people living in areas either under the control of the Sudanese
government or the rebel Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA).
</P>
<P>
Fighting between the government and rebel forces around Juba
has created chronic food shortages for the city's population of
185,000.
</P>
<P>
It was said that most of the Juba people have been forced to
flee their homes and have been left with no access to
agricultural land, making them rely heavily on food assistance.
</P>
<P>
The WFP has provided emergency assistance to more than 2.6
million war-affected Sudanese, 2.2 million of them living in
southern Sudan, since the beginning of this year.

LUANDA, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The police authorities of
Angola and Namibia have decided to strengthen cooperation between
them to guarantee security in the border areas of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by the two sides in the capital of
Angola on Friday at the end of a four-day police meeting.

and weapons trafficking, illegal exploitation of forest resources
and so on.
</P>
<P>
Angola's Police Commander-in-chief Fernando dos Santos said
that with the crime rate increasing in the border areas,
bilateral police cooperation and exchange of information should
be beefed up to make progress in fighting against criminals.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's PM Urges Effective Use of Investment in Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan
Van Khai has called for more effective use of investment to boost
industrial growth, the Vietnamese press reported today.
</P>
<P>
While inspecting the Industry Ministry on Thursday, Phan Van
Khai asked the ministry to balance the distribution of investment
funds among key economic sectors and between rural and urban areas.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, who took office last month, stressed that
priority should be given to processing industries, particularly
for agricultural products, to help increase farmers' earnings.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that money must first of all be put into
profitable sectors capable of retrieving capital investment.
</P>
<P>
In terms of where money should be invested, Phan Van Khai said
economically underdeveloped areas should get it first.
</P>
<P>
During the inspection, he asked the Industry Ministry to
improve exports qualitatively and quantitatively, so as to pave
way for the country's entry into the Free Trade Area of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
Official data showed that Vietnam's industrial growth remained
slow in recent months, particularly in major industrial centers
such as Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Haiphong, and the provinces of
Dong Nai and Khanh Hoa.
</P>
<P>
Unless remarkable changes are made in the industrial sector,
the prime minister said, the growth of the sector itself and the
national economy as a whole will be limited.

<HEADLINE> El Nino Begins to Influence S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 18 (Xinhua) -- South African weather
experts has said that the El Nino weather phenomenon is shaping
to hit South Africa stronger than ever before.
</P>
<P>
Long-term forecaster Emsie Klopper said on Thursday that it
was clear from current rain patterns that El Nino had arrived.
</P>
<P>
According to the Weather Bureau in Pretoria, the capital of
South Africa, the cold and rainy weather being experienced in
most parts of the summer rainfall region in South Africa was not
normal for this time of year.
</P>
<P>
It was an indication that global weather patterns were being
disturbed by an El Niono event, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
Mike Edwards, spokesman for the bureau, said the disturbed
weather patterns were proof that El Nino was having an effect on
South African weather, and that earlier forecasts for dry
conditions from November to March were correct.
</P>
<P>
The general El Nino forceast was that in South Africa and
other countries in the Southern Hemisphere normal or above-normal
rainfall would occur in the first part of the season with a drier
spell in the second part of the season.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Water Affairs and Forestry said earlier that
South Africa was in a better position this year than it was when
the previous serious El Nino event struck in 1982/83.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's water storage levels at major reservoirs were
the best since 1940 and there should be enough water to last
through the normal duration of an El Nino event, the department
said.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: China to Further Opening-up (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 18 (Xinhua) -- China is to actively promote
the development of an economy featuring foreign co-operation to
steadily advance economic internationalization according to the
trans-century strategy set by the 15th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China held in Beijing last month.
</P>
<P>
Since China started to open to the outside world in 1978, its
opening-up efforts in different regions are becoming balanced, and
an all-dimension opening-up pattern has been formed preliminarily.
</P>
<P>
The construction and development of special economic zones
(SEZ) and opening-up zones have prompted the creation of a group
of regional economic growth centers, vigorously bringing along
opening up across the country.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the 1980s, the south China region became
the first to open to the outside world, featuring the rapid growth
of external trade and utilization of overseas funds. The region
prompted the development of the whole eastern coast, creating the
first wave of opening up in the country.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the 1990s, opening-up of the hinterland
has been improved with that of Shanghai's Pudong area, and areas
along the Yangtze River, the borderline and transport trunk lines.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of a diversified and all-dimension opening-up
pattern has not only vigorously advanced regional economic
development, but also played an irreplaceable role in promoting
the growth and quality of the economic sector concerning
international co-operation and of the national economy as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Opening-up has promoted the development of the domestic
economy, with overseas resources and markets contributing more and
more to China's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
In the 1991-1995 period, one percentage point growth in export
volume brought about 0.2 percentage points growth in GDP. The
development of external trade not only expands the demand of the
domestic market, exerting an important influence on prompting
economic growth, but also plays an increasingly significant role
in balancing the relations between domestic supply and demand, and
adjusting the pace of economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: China to Further Opening-up (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a result, China will deepen the reform of its foreign trade
management system to establish a system that tallies with the
socialist market economic system and international norms,
participate in the international multi-lateral trade system and
multi-lateral economic co-operation in the Asia-Pacific region,
strive to reach the market access standards in line with China's
economic development level, and play a bigger role in influencing
the international "game rules."
</P>
<P>
In the course of further opening up, China must gear its
foreign trade and economic cooperation system and policy
adjustment means to international practices to form a standardized
environment for economic internationalization.
</P>
<P>
There remains room for further development, though China has
made quick steps in utilization of overseas funds. At present, the
industrial output value of overseas-funded businesses accounts for
about 15 percent of the national total. If only the part
corresponding to the shares of overseas investors in the
businesses is calculated, the proportion is only about six
percent. And for the tertiary industry, the proportion of the
added value of overseas-funded businesses to the national total is
only three percent.
</P>
<P>
While expanding the fields for overseas investment, China must
pay more attention to investment structure.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to encourage overseas businesses to invest
in agriculture, infrastructure, export-oriented manufacturing, and
rising industries representing the direction of development in the
future.
</P>
<P>
Use of overseas investment in the ordinary processing business
must focus on structure adjustment, enhancement of standards of
the technology introduced, nurturing China's own name-brand
products, and improvement of its own capacity in developing new
technology.
</P>
<P>
The service and trade fields must focus on steady and orderly
opening up to overseas investors, and the country must
appropriately control overseas investment in the real estate and
financial industries to prevent risks incurred by excessive
speculation.
</P>
<P>
China must stick to the principle of "market in exchange for
technology" in using foreign funds, for the improvement of the
contribution of technology to its economic growth and the overall
economic efficiency.

<TEXT>
<P>
In the country's total investment, overseas capital has become
an important source of funds for different sectors and regions. In
1996, the proportion of overseas investment to domestic fixed
investment reached 19.2 percent, that of the industrial output
value of overseas-funded enterprises to the national total 15
percent, and that of the export volume of such enterprises 21.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
These figures indicate that the development of overseas-funded
businesses has considerably promoted the adjustment of and
increase in the domestic economy, especially those of industry.
</P>
<P>
Adherence to the opening-up policy is made essential by China's
needs to promote domestic economic development and adjust its
economic structure. China's basic conditions require that it
should actively develop and utilize overseas resources and
markets, step up external exchanges and cooperation in a
multi-leveled and diversified way.
</P>
<P>
Judging from the requirement of a transition of the economic
development pattern and the current level of its opening-up,
China's opening-up process has entered a new stage, which is
featured by the co-existence of development and readjustment.
</P>
<P>
The main characteristics of the new stage include: reliance on
further optimization of its industrial structure and improvement
of quality efficiency to expand the utilization of the
international market and resources; improvement of standards,
expansion of fields and diversification of the participation in
international labor division; deepening of structural reform and
corresponding adjustment of policy to continue to seek
multi-lateral international and regional economic development.
</P>
<P>
The rapid growth of external trade has remarkably enhanced the
dependence of Chinese economy on the international market. In
1996, China's total foreign trade volume accounted for 35.5
percent of its GDP, which represented a fairly high level in the
world.
</P>
<P>
While expanding foreign trade which centers on improving
economic performance, it is necessary to adhere to the strategy of
giving priority to product quality and to improve the country's
status in international labor division. It is also necessary to
stick to the implementation of a multi-market strategy to expand
the international market.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Take Measures to Curb Traffic Accidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government is going
to intruduce stringent measures to curb road traffic accidents
which claimed an average of 1000 lives every year, according to
Times of Zambia today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Kafula Ng'andu, acting permanent
secretary of the Ministry of Communications and Transport, as
saying here Friday that the government has decided to introduce
breathalyzers in random tests of drivers, in addition to several
other measures that are being designed to make the provision of
safe roads in Zambia more meaningful.
</P>
<P>
Culprits will, on conviction, receive punishment in form of
commuinity manual work, said Ng'andu.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting on road safety which attracted representatives
from the Lusaka city council, Zambia police and relevant
government departments, Ng'andu disclosed that Zambia currently
loses around 30 billion kwacha (about 22.75 million U.S. dollars)
representing two percent of the country's Gross Domestic Product
(GDP).
</P>
<P>
About 1000 people are killed while another 5500 are injured in
road traffic accidents in Zambia every year.
</P>
<P>
"The causative factors are varied, but drunk driving and the
poor state of our roads are among the chief culprits in road
accidents," Ng'andu stressed.
</P>
<P>
He told participants that Zambia has also shaped a road safety
policy reform plan aimming at reducing road traffic accidents by
10 percent in the next few years and a further 20 percent will be
achieved by the year 2007.
</P>
<P>
Other measures that the government is yet to introduce include
the commitment of 5 percent fuel levy to road accident reduction
and engineering, and funding safety publicity from resources from
motor vehicle safety levy, said Times of Zambia.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 18 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela has said that his country is firmly committed to
expanding trade and investment ties with Tanzania and other
African countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a banquet in honor of former Tanzanizan president
Julius Nyerere at weekend, Mandela said to promote the transfer
of skills and technology, and to do everything possible to
promote the development of local business would be in the
interest of the African region.
</P>
<P>
He said he would like to see an expansion of South African
business involvement in Tanzania along such lines.
</P>
<P>
In response, Nyerere said South Africa should work together
with other African countries south of the Sahara to forge a
regional economy able to compete with international business."
</P>
<P>
"South Africa will not make it alone, we have to work
together," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, who arrrived here on Wednesday, launched the Mwalimu
Nyerere Foundation, a non-political development body at a

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Africa Spearheading Fight Against </HEADLINE>

<P>
HARARE, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The delegates from more than 20
African countries have held recently in Harare a malaria control
workshop to discuss the present endemic situation in the
continent and special malaria control plans at country level.
</P>
<P>
They are determined to make the utmost effort to fight against
the plague.
</P>
<P>
Malaria continues to be one of the most serious public health
problems and a major obstacle to social and economic development
in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 270-480 million cases that occur every year in
Africa, 140-280 million cases are children under the age of five
years. It is estimated that in highly endemic areas, a child
under five years of age in Africa will suffer from five to six
episodes of malaria every years.
</P>
<P>
The annual death-toll from malaria in Africa is estimated to
be 1.5 to 2.7 million out of which one million are children under
the age of five years. 17 to 39 percent of hospital deaths in
endemic areas are attributable to malaria.
</P>
<P>
Factors contributing to the present situation include
extension of malaria into some areas that were free or with low
risk of malaria in countries such as Burundi, Madagascar, Saotome
and Principe and the increasing rate of urbanization in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Malaria epidemics are on the increase in Africa, particularly
in highland and desert fringe localities and among non-immune
migrant labourers and refugees who reside in malaria endemic
areas. In recent years, a number of epidemics are also reported
from areas previously known to be malaria free.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, 1995 and 1996, a series of malaria epidemics were
reported from a number of countries in east and southern Africa
with unacceptable level of deaths in all age groups.
</P>
<P>
These waves of frequent epidemics in Africa are associated
with large scale population movements from non-malarious into
malarious areas, construction of dams and irrigation schemes,
major rural development projects and environmental changes
favorable for mosquito breeding and disease transmission.
</P>
<P>
A new but alarming development in Africa is that an increasing
number of older age groups are also developing severe malaria and
thereby dying from the disease.
</P>
<P>
Malaria has a direct negative impact on agricultural
productivity since the peak of malaria transmission coincides
with the active agricultural period such as field preparation,
planning, and harvesting.
</P>
<P>
This negative economic impact for Africa, south of the Sahara,
was estimated in 1987 at 800 million U.S. Dollars and 1.7 billion
U.S. Dollars in 1995. At the current trend, this loss is
expected to double in the next five years.

<P>
HARARE, October 18 (Xinhua) -- In the 1950s, the World Health
Organization (WHO) launched a global campaign to eradicate
malaria in Europe, North America, some parts of Asia, former
Soviet Union and Australia through large scale insecticide
spraying and case detection and treatment.
</P>
<P>
However, not much was done for and by Africa where 90 percent
of the world's malaria cases and deaths occur.
</P>
<P>
The malaria situation in Africa continued to worsen but there
was no active initiative to control this scourge until the
adoption of the regional malaria control strategy at the
inter-regional WHO conference held in Brazzaville in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, WHO has organized activities to strengthen
national capacities in policy formulation, planning, monitoring
and evaluation of national malaria control programs.
</P>
<P>
The regional task force on malaria established in April 1995,
has been given the responsibility of monitoring the progress of
implementation of malaria control activities in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The task force also has the role of mobilizing and
coordinating resources for the implementation of malaria control
activities in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many malaria endemic countries of the region have
developed malaria control plans of action and are at various
levels of implementation. Technical guidelines have been produced
and made available to member states. Training activities for
district health workers are being carried out in almost all
countries.
</P>
<P>
The results of large scale research studies on impregnated
bednets and other materials from Gambia, Ghana, Burkina-Faso and
Kenya have shown that the use of these materials can reduce
childhood mortality by 25 to 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
Currently 27 countries are promoting the use of insecticide
impregnated materials, mostly bednets.
</P>
<P>
In order to increase support for malaria control in Africa,
WHO's director general made available 18 million U.S. Dollars to
support the process of accelerated implementation of malaria
control programs in the African region in 1997 and 1998.

<HEADLINE> Chile Not to Request U.S. Non-NATO Ally Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Chile will not ask for the
special non-NATO ally status granted to Argentina by the United
States on Thursday, the Chilean foreign minister said today.
</P>
<P>
Argentina gained the status for its participation in several
peace operations, Jose Miguel Insulza told reporters when asked
about the decision by U.S. President Bill Clinton in Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, now visiting Argentina, granted his host the status as
an ally outside the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
But on Chile's part, Insulza explained, "we did not go to the
Gulf, did not sent troops to Haiti, or soldiers to Bosnia, so we
cannot demand recognition for things we have not done."
</P>
<P>
The largely symbolic status as a special ally would give
Argentina priority access to U.S.-made weapons, ammunition and
spare parts, and more U.S. cooperation in military training.
</P>
<P>
Under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, the U.S. president
has the right to designate close military allies, a status that
does not require U.S. help in case of attacks, but allows the
allies to buy excess U.S. weapons.
</P>
<P>
Countries already designated as close non-NATO U.S. allies are
Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Insulza said Chile has already expressed its policy about peace
operations, and its troops are "available for peace maintenance
operations, but not for peace imposition, meaning to separate
warring factions, and for verifying that the peace agreements
already reached are complied with."
</P>
<P>
Asked if Chile had told the United States about its refusal to
be a special non-NATO ally, Insulza stated that "we have no reason
whatsoever for communicating this officially."

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Foreign Reserves Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's foreign reserves have
risen to 621 million U.S. dollars from 572.3 m dollars recorded
three years ago, reported the local daily The Monitor today.
</P>
<P>
Bank of Uganda's status of economy report of September 1997
was quoted as saying that this represents 61.7 percent increase
in the last ten years, adding that reserves as at 1986 when the
current Museveni's government came to power stood at below 384 m
dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the other front, Uganda's current account deficit moved
from 228 m dollars (equivalent of 8.91 percent of gdp) in 1995/96
to 224 m dollars (8.4 percent of gdp) in 1996/97, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
This improvement has resulted mainly from the growth in
merchandize exports (8.2 growth) led by gold which has almost
tripled from 35.15 m dollars in 1995/96 to an estimated 101 m
dollars, the report said.
</P>
<P>
To this effect the country's economy according to the report,
shows a vibrant edge.
</P>
<P>
Non-monetary gdp has however, shown a steady decline over the
last ten years down from 35 percent in 1987 to 24 percent in
1996, the report said, adding this probably is an indication of
increased absorption of the non-monetary sector into in monetary
sector (marketisation) rather than an indication of declining
income.
</P>
<P>
The share of agriculture in total gdp, has maintained a steady
decline from 55 percnet in 1987 to 44 percent in 1996 due to bad
weather and the economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The document pointed out that the increasing share of
manufacturing, construction and trade has case to smile for.
</P>
<P>
The country's annual headline inflation rate rose to 10
percent in April this year and 11.8 percent in May from about 6
-7 percent until March this year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Total foreign exchange inflows into Uganda have grown from
1,632.64 m dollars in 1995/96 to an estimated 1,810 million
dollars for 1996/97, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Poland's New constitution Takes Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Poland's new constitution, the
first since the country's drastic change in 1989, went into effect
today to institutionalize a Western-style democracy.
</P>
<P>
Passed by the parliament in April and approved in a referendum
in May with 52.1 percent of the votes, the constitution was signed
by Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski on July 16.
</P>
<P>
By law, it came into effect three months after the formal
presidential endorsement.
</P>
<P>
The constitution reaffirms the separation of the three
government branches -- the legislative, executive and judicial --
as the country's basic political system.
</P>
<P>
It weakens the presidency by allowing the parliament to
override presidential veto by three-fifths of votes in the House
of Representatives rather than the previous two-thirds majority.
</P>
<P>
It also provides that the president of the republic is elected
by popular vote to serve a term of five years, during which he or
she appoints the prime minister who in turn nominates a cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the parliament comprises the 460-seat House of
Representatives and the 100-seat Senate popularly elected under a
proportional representative system for a term of four years.
</P>
<P>
The constitution defines the country's economic system as the
one based on economic freedom, private ownership, and on the
unity, dialogue and cooperation of various "social partners."
</P>
<P>
The charter and guarantees the freedom of religious believes,
and provides, among other civil rights, the universal access to
free health care and free education for citizens under age 18.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Buries Guevara </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Cuba today buried the legendary
Argentine-born Cuban guerrilla leader Ernesto "Che" Guevara 30
years after he was killed trying to start revolution in Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
With President Fidel Castro's presence, the funeral took place
in the Revolution Square of the central city of Santa Clara, where
Guevara's remains were buried in a specially built mausoleum.
</P>
<P>
Castro praised the man, his lieutenant in the struggle leading
to Cuba's 1959 revolution, as a moral giant in his tribute.
</P>
<P>
The image of Guevara, the president said, would grow as the
world was blighted with injustice, exploitation, inequality,
unemployment, poverty, hunger and misery.
</P>
<P>
Guevara, an Argentine-born doctor, was captured by Bolivian
troops on October 8, 1967, while leading an abortive uprising
there, and was executed on the following day.
</P>
<P>
His remains, flung into a secret mass grave near a Bolivian
town, were unearthed and returned to Cuba three months ago.
</P>
<P>
Castro ended his tribute by repeating, "until victory always,"
Guevara's famous words in his farewell letter to the Cuban leader
when he left the island in 1965 to try to export revolution abroad.
</P>
<P>
After Castro's tribute, officers of the Revolutionary Armed
Forces placed the caskets of Guevara and six of his comrades in a
mausoleum built under Guevara's monument.
</P>
<P>
The other six -- four Cubans, a Bolivian and a Peruvian -- died
with Guevara on the Bolivian mission.
</P>
<P>
Castro lit the eternal flame of the mausoleum and then soldiers
went on a grand parade. More than 100,000 Cubans, waving flags and
portraits of Guevara, called out "until victory always."
</P>
<P>
Factory sirens, car horns and cannon volleys blared out across
the island in a minute's tribute after the funeral.
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara, 270 kilometers southeast of Havana, was captured
by Guevara on January 1959 in a battle that was decisive for the
victory of the Cuban revolution against dictator Fulgencio Batista.
</P>
<P>
Guevara's widow and his four children lived in Cuba and his two
brothers and a sister came from Argentina to attend the funeral.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysia's CPO, Tin, Rubber Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's markets of
crude palm oil (CPO) physicals, tin and rubber closed the week
mixed.
</P>
<P>
On the CPO physicals market this week, October-South jumped 80
ringgit (about 25 U.S. dollars) to 1,600 ringgit (about 500 U.S.
dollars) per ton, the highest mark for the week, as the market was
braced by fresh buying.
</P>
<P>
The performance of CPO physicals next week will depend on the
movement of the futures market, dealers said, adding the currency
factor would again be the main factor to judge the price movement
next week.
</P>
<P>
The ringgit was quoted easier at 3.22 to the U.S. dollar at
this week's close.
</P>
<P>
This week on the local metal market, the tin price closed
higher, settling at 17.81 ringgit (about 5.56 U.S. dollars) per kg
against 16.57 ringgit (about 5.17 U.S. dollars) per kg last week.
</P>
<P>
At the close, turnover was moderately lower at 358 tons from
385 tons last week.
</P>
<P>
The performance of the Malaysian tin remained uncertain next
week as it will be underpinned by the ringgit's value with trading
expected to be ranged on moderate interest, a trader said.
</P>
<P>
On Malaysia's rubber market, prices finished the week easier.
Against last week's close, November RSS One wrapped up the week
2.5 sen lower to 279 sen (about 87 U.S. cents) per kg while SMR 20
dipped 1.5 sen to 278 sen (about 86 U.S. cents) per kg.
</P>
<P>
The International Natural Rubber Organization (INRO) daily
market indicator price for October 16 was higher at 205.09
Malaysia/Singapore cents per kg against 208.42 cents per kg on
October 9.
</P>
<P>
The five-day moving average was quoted at 204.67 cents per kg
against 212.59 cents per kg last week.
</P>
<P>
The rubber prices could recover next week on price adjustment
to the local currency, a trader expected.

The country's foreign exchange reserves amounted to 1.67
billion dollars on August 31 against 1.59 billion on July 31, 1.71
billion on June 30, 1.76 billion on May 30, 1.77 billion on April
30, 1.74 billion on March 31, 1.86 billion on February 28 and 1.98
billion in January, the Bangladesh Bank sources stated.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior official at the Foreign Exchange Policy
Department of the Bangladesh Bank, the country's foreign exchanges
reserves have fell far short of the appropriate level as
recommended by the International Monetary Fund, which calls for a
country to retain foreign currencies equivalent to three months'
import bills, as Bangladesh's monthly imports usually amounts to
650 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The present foreign exchange holdings are roughly equivalent
to two and a half months' imports, which should be considered
alarming, since more depletion in the coming months is inevitable
because of growing import demands, particularly for luxury goods
and food items," the official said.
</P>
<P>
The official also attributed the depletion in foreign exchange
holdings to the shortfall in aid disbursements and huge import
payments against import bills for luxury goods and food items.
</P>
<P>
The reduced export receipts and large import payments are the
major factors behind depletion in the foreign exchange holdings,
the official added.
</P>
<P>
The remittances sent by the country's wage earners' from abroad
is one of the major sources of foreign exchange, the official
pointed out, but a downward trend has prevailing in the wage
earners' remittances since January this year.
</P>
<P>
Besides, visits by the ministers and high officials of the
government to foreign countries is also another factor behind the
depletion of foreign exchange reserves, the official added.
</P>
<P>
The government has been making constant efforts to improve the
foreign exchange holdings level under immense pressure from the
donors but it has apparently failed to overcome the sluggish
situation, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Meeting Agrees to Aid Albania With Conditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 17 (Xinhua) -- A strategy for providing
"conditional" aid to help reconstruct Albania's economy was
decided at an international conference held here today.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from donor countries, the European Union and
the World Bank agreed to condition further aid to Albania on its
immediate political reforms and full adherence to market rules.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, convened to prepare an upcoming donors'
meeting, the World Bank foresaw an international commitment of 1.5
billion U.S. dollars to Albania over a seven-year period.
</P>
<P>
Albanian Premier Fatos Nano called on the donor countries to
provide some 350 million dollars for his country -- 100 dollars
per capita -- for the next 12 to 18 months.
</P>
<P>
But Nano added that he was not asking for money divorced from
specific projects after his 100 dollars per capita plan was
immediately dismissed by Dini as "unrealistic."
</P>
<P>
Dini, who chaired the meeting, said Albania had signed a letter
of understanding with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in
which fiscal and monetary policing measures are listed.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting, aimed at paving the way for a donors'
conference to be held in Brussels on October 22, was held also to
assess the progress made by Albania's new leadership.
</P>
<P>
Satisfied with what the new Albanian government had done to
restore stability, participants agreed to hold a similar meeting
in Rome or Tirana to find better ways to help Albania.
</P>
<P>
Albania descended into chaos in early March when protests
triggered by the collapse of pyramid investment schemes, in which
thousands of Albanians lost their life saving, mushroomed across
the country.
</P>
<P>
The protests turned violent after armed rebels looted army
depots and took over several towns in the south.
</P>
<P>
The country was back on track only when a new government was
formed after former president Sali Berisha, widely blamed for the
collapse of the investment schemes, resigned in July.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Celebrates 1st Anniversary of Constitutional Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The existence of the Ukrainian
Constitutional Court showed Ukraine's commitment to democratic
reforms, Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma said today.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony commemorating the first anniversary of the
Constitutional Court, Kuchma said the court served as a guarantee
that Ukraine would remain on the road to democracy.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma warned against attempts to exert pressure on the court,
which he described as the sole organ protecting the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, the court was used as a buffer in political
conflicts between the president and the Supreme Soviet, or the
Ukrainian parliament.
</P>
<P>
The parliament has accused Kuchma many times as
unconstitutional when the president vetoed parliamentary bills,
such as the Law on Local Administration.
</P>
<P>
However, the court so far has judged no case as
unconstitutional, which in some way helped the president. As a
result, the parliament tried in early September to weaken the
Constitutional Court through an amendment to the constitution.
</P>
<P>
The amendment, which would give the parliament a status as the
final arbiter of the constitutionality of legislation, failed to
pass through the Supreme Soviet.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma also declared at the celebration that the court should
not be drawn into political struggle that is currently gathering
pace as the March 1998 parliamentary elections come in sight.

<HEADLINE> Italy Backs Slovenia's Bid for NATO, EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Italy today reiterated its support
for Slovenia's early entry into the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) and the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini recommitted the support while
holding talks with his new Slovenian counterpart Boris Frlec, who
is here to attend a ministerial conference on Albania.
</P>
<P>
Dini hoped that Slovenia's bid for NATO and EU memberships
would be discussed early next year.
</P>
<P>
A NATO summit in Madrid in July decided to invite Poland,
Hungary and the Czech Republic to enter into NATO. But split
remained among NATO members over the enlargement pace.
</P>
<P>
Italy and some other NATO members want Slovenia and Romania to
be among the first group of countries to be invited into the
alliance, while the United States prefers a limited group.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the significance of admitting Slovenia and Romania,
Italy held that southern Europe is likely to become the most
complicated and volatile region in the continent, both politically
and economically.
</P>
<P>
At their meeting in Rome, Dini and Frlec also noted the rapid
growth of bilateral ties, fostered in part by the consolidation of
the trilateral relations between Italy, Slovenia and Hungary.
</P>
<P>
Dini spoke highly of Slovenia's participation in the
multi-national peacekeeping operation in Albania, and noted that
the Italian government will try its best to protect ethnic
Slovenians residing in Italy.
</P>
<P>
Frlec in turn reiterated the Slovenian government's
determination to protect ethnic Italians in Slovenia.

<HEADLINE> Indian Exporters Call for Devaluation of Rupee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 18 (Xinhua)-- In view of Pakistan
devaluating its currency by 8 percent on Wednesday, Indian
exporters are clamoring for a similar move, a local newspaper
Business Standard reported here today.
</P>
<P>
They claimed that rice, leather, textiles and garments,
chemicals exports from India would be hit by Pakistan's
devaluation.
</P>
<P>
Federation of Indian Export Organizations President Ramu S.
Deora said that he has written to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
seeking a devaluation of 5-10 percent of the rupee with the new
credit policy.
</P>
<P>
The exporters also wanted a 4-5 percent difference between the
rate at which export finance is available and the prime lending
rate. They are seeking a cut in the rate of export finance from 11
to 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Delhi Exporters Association President S.P. Aggarwal has also
appealed to the government for a devaluation. "This is the second
time Pakistan has devalued its currency- both times by around 8
percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indian government officials admitted that the Pakistani
devaluation could hurt exports of textiles and garments since the
two countries compete in these areas.

<HEADLINE> Women's 100m Record-Breaker Blamed by Coach after Heats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Li Xuemei shocked by herself
by breaking the women's 100-meter Asian record, but was stunned by
her coach who surprisingly threw the cold water upon his protege
after the heats instead.
</P>
<P>
"Congratulations first," said coach Zhang Rongwei, "But I still
had to blame you. Your record-breaking feat in the heats did no
good for yourself in the finals."
</P>
<P>
Zhang Rongwei butted the 20-year-old sprinter at the track side
on Friday right after the preliminaries as the budding star was
still full of excitement.
</P>
<P>
Li clocked the fastest of 10.90 seconds in the morning's heats
to better the Asian record of 11.02 set by her compatriot Liu
Xiaomei four years ago.
</P>
<P>
While blaming Li for her early exposure, coach Zhang was still
unable to hide his smiles, saying "Li was not the person to be
blamed actually because she was under no pressure in the heats,
which played an important role for her record."
</P>
<P>
"Li originally competed in the hurdles, and I recruited her
into my camp after the Seventh National Games four years ago as
the teenager impressed me deeply in 1990 with her swift set-off,
quick rhythm and fluent movements," Zhang recalled.
</P>
<P>
"She has made steady and promising progresses in the years, she
was surely a good sprinter with great potentials," said the coach.
</P>
<P>
"To predict the finals, I personally think Li is the odds-on
favorite," Zhang said with confidence.

</P>
<P>
Citing his forthcoming state visit to the United States as a
major event in the Sino-US relationship, President Jiang said he
hopes that this visit will enable himself to extensively contact
US congressmen and friends in other sectors, in order to enhance
mutual understanding and friendship between the people of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the two countries should approach their

<HEADLINE> Thai Government Scraps Oil Tax Rise Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has revoked
a three-day-old oil price hike decision, according to a government
house press release available today.
</P>
<P>
The one-baht-per-liter oil price increase was introduced on
Tuesday to increase government revenue by 24 billion baht (655
million U.S. dollars) for fiscal 1998, which began on October 1.
</P>
<P>
The government is under pressure of the International Monetary
Fund to maintain a budget surplus of 1 percent of gross domestic
product.
</P>
<P>
The price hike for petrol and diesel was scrapped on Friday at
a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh,
following the public's display of dissatisfaction and threat of
mass demonstrations calling for the prime minister's resignation.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts say the reverse of the decision would do harm
to the government's credibility and could send financial markets
into a tailspin.
</P>
<P>
The scrapping of the oil price rise might mean tax increase on
other items or further cuts in government expenditures.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the cabinet on Friday also decided to delay the
approval of eagerly expected five critical decrees on financial
reform because of "technical errors."
</P>
<P>
The five decrees, expected to be unveiled on Friday, were
designed to establish the financial restructuring authority and
the asset management corporation to manage the 58 suspended
debt-ridden finance firms.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for Hemispheric Free Trade Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, October 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton today praised the South Common Market (Mercosur) and again
raised the need to forge a hemispheric free trade alliance.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting here with 500 Argentine businessmen, the visiting
U.S. president said Mercosur not only helps expand trade in the
region, but also enhances efforts to promote democracy and peace.
</P>
<P>
Established in December 1994 to promote free trade among its
member countries -- currently Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and
Uruguay, Mercosur is the biggest trade bloc in South America.
</P>
<P>
Trade groups of the similar kind in the west hemisphere are
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Andean Pact.
</P>
<P>
In his speech today, Clinton asked members of these regional
groups to create the Free Trade Area of Americas (FTAA) covering
800 million people from Alaska of the United States in North
America to the Patagonia in South America.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral economic relations, he said trade between the
United States and Argentina reached 6.8 billion U.S. dollars in
1996, a 152 percent increase over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, U.S. investment in Argentina grew from 2
billion to 12.5 billion dollars during the period of 1990-1996 and
is expected to reach 18 billion dollars by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Argentine President Carlos Menem, the
two presidents expressed willingness to better cooperate in trade.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he is working to convince U.S. Congress to approve
"fast track" trade negotiation authority to dismantle trade
barriers and open U.S. doors to emerging markets in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed new mechanism, Congress has the right to
approve or reject any international trade accord already reached
by the U.S. administration, but can not amend the document.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, here since Wednesday after visiting Venezuela and
Brazil, will end his week-long Latin America tour on Sunday.

BANGKOK, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's plans for four new

government budget, according to Saravuth Thammasiri, governor of

<HEADLINE> State Firm on Huaihe Treatment Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 18 (Xinhua) -- With only two and half months
left till the State Council's deadline for limiting discharge of
pollutants in the Huaihe River Valley, the central government has
resolved to ensure that the target is reached on time.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily quoted Zhang Kunmin, deputy administrator
of the National Environmental protection Agency of China (Nepa),
as saying that Nepa would soon launch a national drive to force
all enterprises in the Huaihe Valley in east China to step up work
toward the target, and those that cannot clean up must be closed
before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the State Council required that all enterprises along
the river treat industrial waste to meet state-set standards by
the end of this year and that the whole river be cleaned up by
2,000.
</P>
<P>
The Huaihe Valley is one of the seven major water systems in
the country, and one of its important grain and energy production
bases. It has been seriously contaminated in the past decade with
about half of the 191 rivers in the basin turning black and foul
and having lost their function.
</P>
<P>
Data from Nepa indicate that by the end of August, about 33.6
percent of the 1,562 enterprises with a daily discharge of
wastewater above 100 tons in the four Huaihe Valley provinces -
Anhui, Jiangsu, Henan and Shangdong - have reached the state
target.
</P>
<P>
The program to treat pollution in the valley will cost 27.5
billion yuan (3.2 billion US dollars).

<P>
BEIJING, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Protecting and developing
well-known name-brand products is the central issue on a forum on
quality control opened here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily reported that about 200 high-ranking
officials, outstanding economists and researchers, and
representatives of well-known Chines manufacturers attending the
forum agree that that an economy without name brands lacks
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
They called for efforts to punish the illegal making and
selling of fake products.
</P>
<P>
In a written congratulatory message to the forum, Vice-Premier
Wu Bangguo said although the quality of Chinese products is good
in general, some serious problems still exist, especially the
practice of making counterfeits of Chinese name-brand products.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the practice has affected the reputations of the
name-brand products of excellent quality, endangered the survival
and development of some enterprises and seriously compromised the
public trust, as well.
</P>
<P>
"It is the common responsibility of the society to crack down
on fake goods and protect well-known brands," Wu stressed.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine and Austria have built a
legal basis for expanding their trade and economic cooperation,
Austrian Finance Minister Rudolf Edlinger said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an economic roundtable, Edlinger said Ukraine and
Austria on Thursday signed an agreement to avoid double taxation,
so as to provide a new impetus for furthering bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Austria's opening of an investment bank in Kiev on
Thursday, Ukrainian Finance Minister Igor Mitiukov said Austrian
bankers and businessmen were among the first to operate in Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Edlinger said Ukraine is the second among the
former Soviet republics in priority to Austria and the bilateral
trade turnover reached more than 400 million U.S. dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Edlinger, here since Thursday for a three-day visit, said his
trip was aimed at establishing contacts with representatives of
Ukrainian ministries and to outline specific cooperation programs.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine is experiencing substantial problems in implementing
privatization programs due to shortages of funds, said Mitiukov.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the Austrian investment bank in Ukraine, he
said, is an event of high importance that will attract more
capital inflow and help the growth of trade turnover.

<HEADLINE> Smog Reduces Visibility to Zero in Cities of Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Choking smog caused by forest
fires in Indonesia returned to several cities on Friday, and the
visibility in one Sumatra town was reported to be reduced to zero.
</P>
<P>
Government officials said here today visibility in several
cities on Sumatra and Kalimantan islands, was between 100 meters
and 500 meters, and more fires were reported on the two islands.
</P>
<P>
Dense smokes from fires on Sumatra and Borneo have spread over
much of Southeast Asia in the past two months, causing widespread
health warnings and being blamed at least partly for an air crash
and ship collisions.
</P>
<P>
"As of early Friday morning, we have received reports which say
visibility in cities such as Palembang, Bengkulu, Jambi and Padang
on Sumatra is between 100 and 500 meters," a Jakarta
Meteorological Department official said.
</P>
<P>
Residents in Padang, west Sumatra, said the city was "dark."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, part of the capital Jakarta was shrouded by thick
haze on Friday, but the official said this was the result of
pollutants rather than smoke from the forest fires.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Forum for Environment (Walhi) estimated earlier
that at least 1.7 million hectares of forests have been damaged by
the fires and the total loss of the fires and haze was 6.2
trillion rupiah (about 1.7 billion U.S. dollars).

<P>
COLOMBO, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The governments of United
states, Germany, Britain and Japan have joined the United Nations
to condemn Wednesday's bombing in Colombo and extend their
sympathy to the families of the victims.
</P>
<P>
UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan strongly condemned the bomb
attack in Colombo, his spokesman Fred Eckhard said on Thursday's
press briefing at UN headquarters in New York.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General is appalled by the news of the bomb
attack in Colombo and the resulting loss of life and destruction
of property. He strongly condemns this terrorist attack, which
targeted civilian facilities," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
A local newspaper quoted its sources in Washington as saying
that the U.S. State Department has released a statement condemning
the Colombo bombing.
</P>
<P>
The statement said: "If the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE) was responsible for this indiscriminate attack, it's a
further demonstration of the threat caused by the LTTE to the
security of American nationals."
</P>
<P>
"The threat was a justification for their being designated by
the Secretary of State Madeleine Albright as a terrorist
organization."
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said in a message to Sri
Lankan Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar that he "was deeply
distressed to learn about the cowardly and senseless attack on a
hotel in Colombo which claimed so many innocent human victims."
</P>
<P>
In a message to Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga,
British Prime Minister Tony Blair said: " I very much deplore the
loss of life and many injuries caused by this appalling incident,
we strongly condemn this terrible attack."

<P>
The Japanese Government in a statement said: "Japan condemns
all forms of terrorism and sincerely hopes the Sri Lankan
Government and its people will continue to make efforts for
realizing everlasting peace, the nation's wholehearted desire, by
overcoming the present tragedy."

<HEADLINE> Japan to Help Indonesia Deal With Currency Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Japan is prepared to give
technical and financial assistance to Indonesia to help the
country overcome its currency crisis, a senior Japanese official
said.
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese government stands solidly behind Indonesia ...
and is ready to extend bilateral financial or technical assistance
to the country," visiting Japanese Vice Finance Minister for
International Affairs Eisuke Sakakibara said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Japan would back any program endorsed by international
organizations, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
the World Bank (WB) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help
Indonesia recover from the currency turmoil, Sakakibara was quoted
today by Antara News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
IMF delegates and WB and ADB representatives are in Jakarta to
discuss a financial aid package for Indonesia. the IMF-led team
has not announced details of the aid package but analysts
speculate that the assistance would include standby loans worth up
to 12 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Sakakibara, who also met members of the IMF-led team during his
Indonesian visit, said assistance from Japan would come after a
decision on an aid package now being put together by the IMF, WB
and ADB.
</P>
<P>
Sakakibara's comments turned the falling markets around,
boosting the rupiah (the national currency) to 3,570 against the
U.S. dollar at the close in Jakarta after hitting a low of 3,710
earlier.
</P>
<P>
The dollar has gained more than 50 percent against the rupiah
since the beginning of this year, making the Indonesian currency
the worst hit in the turbulent region.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts said speculation over details of the IMF-led
assistance to restore confidence in the Indonesian rupiah is
likely to dominate the country's financial markets next week.

<HEADLINE> Poverty Relief Foundation Helps Poor in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The Foundation for
Underdeveloped Regions of China (FURC), a non-governmental
organization established in 1989, is currently carrying out three
major poverty relief projects.
</P>
<P>
The projects focus on the country's southwest and northwest
regions, where most of its poverty-stricken people live, today's
China Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
Among the 58 million suffering from poverty in China, 20
million are in the southwest, and 10 million in the northwest.
</P>
<P>
The projects involved the creation of arable land by blasting
away rock in the mountainous areas in Guizhou province, clean
drinking water for local residents in Gansu and Shaanxi provinces,
and reconstruction of houses in Sichuan province.
</P>
<P>
By March of next year, 667 hectares of land will have been
cleared in Guizhou. By the end of this year, 2,000 water tanks
will have been built in Gansu and Shaanxi, and 1,500 families will
have had houses re-built in Sichuan.

<HEADLINE> Two Leftist Leaders Arrested in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Two leaders of a Philippine
leftist guerrilla group blamed for more than 200 assassinations
have been captured by the military in the central Philippines,
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Nilo de la Cruz, head of the urban hit squad Alex Boncayao
Brigade (ABB), were arrested in Marilao town, Bulacan province
north of Manila, Thursday night, the reports quoted military
officials as telling reporters Friday.
</P>
<P>
Also apprehended were Arturo Tabara, secretary general of the
Revolutionary Workers' Party, the ABB's political arm, and two
other ABB members, Army chief Lt. Gen. Celmente Mariano said.
</P>
<P>
De la Cruz, carrying a reward of 1.5 million pesos (44,000 U.S.
dollars) on his head, has been hunted for eight years, surrendered
after a brief shoot-out with a team of army intelligence agents
and local police in Marilao town. The intelligence agents had
tailed De la Cruz for nearly three months.
</P>
<P>
From 1986 to 1996, De la Cruz as head of the ABB has directed
the assassination of more than 200 policemen, military personnel
and civilians in Metro Manila, Mariano said.
</P>
<P>
Among the victims were U.S. Army Col. James Rowe, chief of the
Joint U.S. Military Advisory Group, who was killed in a daylight
ambush in April 1989 in Manila.
</P>
<P>
De la Cruz has also been accused of masterminding 30 robberies
and kidnappings in order to raise funds for the operations.
</P>
<P>
The ABB was established in Metro Manila in the early 1980s by
de la Cruz and other members of the Communist Party of the
Philippines (CPP). But in February 1997, the group broke away from
the CPP and its New People's Army due to internal differences.
</P>
<P>
In December 1996, President Fidel Ramos ordered a crackdown on
the ABB after local industrialist Leonardo Ty was killed by
suspected ABB members. At least 16 ABB members have been arrested
since then, according to the military.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Posts Savings in Debt Payments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government posted
savings of 1.696 billion pesos (about 49.9 million U.S. dollars)
in debt service payments in the first nine months of this year,
despite the ill-effect of the peso depreciation and accelerating
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest data on the government's cash budget
operations, the total debt service payment for the first three
quarters of the year amounted to 86.794 billion pesos, 1.696
billion pesos lower than the 88.490 billion pesos projected for
the period.
</P>
<P>
Of the 86.794 billion peso debt service payment for the nine
months, 58.341 billion pesos were used to pay interest on both
domestic and foreign obligations, and the rest went to pay for
principal amortization.
</P>
<P>
Government figures show that the government paid 17.342 billion
pesos to service the principal amount of its foreign debt, 2.213
billion pesos more than the programmed payments.
</P>
<P>
Interest payments for the foreign debt were also 0.403 billion
pesos higher than the programmed amount of 12.184 billion pesos.
</P>
<P>
The increase in payments was due to the depreciation of the
peso. The government had assumed debt service payments at a rate
of only 26.54 to the dollar, but the average foreign exchange rate
used when payment was made was placed at 27.52 pesos against the
dollar.
</P>
<P>
However, the increased debt service payments were offset by the
lower debt service payments on principal and interest on
internally generated liabilities.
</P>
<P>
Interest payments for domestic borrowings in the first nine
months of the year were lower by 1.425 billion pesos to 45.754
billion pesos against the target of 47.179 billion pesos.
</P>
<P>
The sharp depreciation of the peso during the last three months
will cost the government much more for the debt payments in the
last quarter of the year. The peso has fallen to 34 against the
dollar from 26.5 since July.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Japan Reach Agreement Over Shipping Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Japan
reached an agreement to settle their tense shipping dispute today,
two days following the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission (FMC)
threatened to bar Japanese ships from U.S. ports.
</P>
<P>
Officials from both countries noted they have reached an
agreement in principle to give U.S shippers the same access to
Japan's ports that the Japanese enjoy in the United States.
</P>
<P>
U.S. shippers have complained for a long time about burdensome
Japanese port rules that drive up costs.
</P>
<P>
Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat, the leader of the
U.S. negotiating team, characterized the deal as a "breakthrough
which we hope will lead to meaningful reform of these restrictive,
costly and prohibitive port practices."
</P>
<P>
The trade dispute flared up dramatically this week when the
FMC, the U.S. independent regulatory organization, decided to bar
container cargo ships from Japan's three major shipping lines from
entering U.S. ports.
</P>
<P>
The ban was scheduled to take effect at midnight Friday, but it
is widely believed here that the FMC would drop its order in wake
of the progress achieved in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Lower-level negotiators were directed to work out the fine
print, a process that the U.S. side estimated might take the
weekend to wrap up.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the Japanese agreed to create an
alternative system for U.S. and other foreign carriers to
negotiate for stevedores to unload their ships.
</P>
<P>
The three Japanese shipping lines -- Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, Ltd.,
Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd., and Nippon Yusen K.K. -- typically
carry containers of boxes that can be loaded onto railroad cars.
These companies were ordered to pay for an estimated 4 million
U.S. dollars in fines that came due at midnight Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Those fines, which is about 100,000 dollars per ship entering a
U.S. port, were imposed starting in September after the U.S.
claimed the Japanese government failed to live up to earlier
commitments to liberalize port practices.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Safeguard Bank Investments in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 18 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines is considering putting up safeguards for banks'
securities and stock investments, local newspaper the Philippine
Star reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Deputy Central Bank Governor alberto Reyes as
saying that one possible safeguard would be to require banks to
set aside additional provisions for possible loss from their
securities and stock investments, especially with the downturn in
the equities market.
</P>
<P>
Reyes said that the central bank wants banks to
"mark-to-market" their securities and stocks exposures as the
measure is necessary amid recent ups and downs in the equities
market.
</P>
<P>
"It is very important now because of the present situation in
the stock market," he said, adding the market has been adversely
affected by the on-going currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine stock market has suffered a slump, with the
volatility in the currency market as foreign investors try to
minimize their exposure in the country. The composite index of the
stock market has dropped to around 2000 from above 3000 at the
beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the declines in the value of banks' stocks, Reyes
said that banks should recognize their losses.
</P>
<P>
He said that based on initial studies, the proposed
provisioning may be charged to bank's operating cost.
</P>
<P>
Reyes admitted that the measures would affect the profitability
of banks as they are expected to provide reserves for these
losses.

<P>
PANAMA CITY, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Panamanian anti-drug police
seized 542 kilograms of cocaine and detained seven persons in two
operations today in the Atlantic coast, according to a police
report.
</P>
<P>
Police agents seized 173 kilograms of the drug hidden in 25 air
conditioning appliances in the Alcazar Internacional company
installations in the Colon Customs Free Zone as it was loaded in a
container for shipment to a South American country.
</P>
<P>
The authorities said that seven persons were detained and the
manager of the company is under investigation.
</P>
<P>
The other 369 kilograms of cocaine was seized during an intense
chase in the Portobelo road of the Atlantic Colon province, after
a suspected truck overturned in the Las Mercedes curve during the
flight toward the city of Colon, some 80 kilometers west of this
capital.
</P>
<P>
Drug trafficking continues being a prime concern for Panamanian
authorities, which have confiscated in less than a week 2,170
kilograms of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
Panama enjoys a perfect geographical position with coasts in
the Atlantic and the Pacific and its neighborhood with Colombia,
which facilitates the transport of drugs toward United States and
European markets.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, Panamanian authorities have confiscated more
than eight tons of cocaine.

<HEADLINE> Non-Governmental Exchanges Crucial Link Between China, U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 18 (Xinhua) -- Sino-U.S. relations were
clouded when David Boren, former chairman of the intelligence
committee of the U.S. Senate, visited Beijing for the first time
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Boren came to China at the invitation of a non-governmental
organization -- the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs
(CPIFA) -- because official exchanges were almost non-existent
then.
</P>
<P>
The China he saw was in such contrast to the one that he
learned about through the U.S. media that he said at the end of
his visit: "There has been no trip like this one that my view of a
large country was totally changed by the first visit."
</P>
<P>
Despite subsequent ups and downs in Sino-U.S. relations, the
political communities of the two countries have not stopped
communicating through non-government channels.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Boren's Beijing trip became the prelude to a series of
visits by a large number of U.S. legislators during the summer of
1993 through the spring of 1994.
</P>
<P>
Boren's conclusion, voiced during his visit and widely accepted
in the U.S. political community, was that Sino-U.S. interaction
would be the most important bilateral relations in the next
century.
</P>
<P>
The crucial role of non-government contact became apparent
whenever the two countries were at odds.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, bilateral relations chilled abruptly after the United
States invited Taiwan's Lee Tung Hui to visit. However, on the
invitation of a Chinese non-government organization, a large
number of U.S. legislators and their aides came to China.
</P>
<P>
Among them were such congressional leaders as Robert
Livingston, Bennett Johnston and Nancy Kassenbaum.
</P>
<P>
Through frank and extensive talks with their hosts, these
legislative leaders said that Lee's visit was a mistake. Because
of the legislators' influence, their views received wide attention
in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
From 1994 through 1996, 34 senators and 46 members of the House
of Representatives visited China on the invitation of the Chinese
People's Institute of Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
As the date of Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit to the
U.S. approaches, the number of U.S. legislators who have visited
China through non-government channels is increasing. Thirty-five
members of Congress already visited China in the first month of
this year. During their visits, they discussed such issues as
Taiwan, trade, human rights and Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Non-governmental exchanges have maintained an open channel of
communication between the two countries. These exchanges have
created a favorable condition for the improvement and expansion of
official links.
</P>
<P>
One well-known U.S. China expert put forward the idea of
"all-round engagement" during his visit to Beijing in
1994. U.S. President Bill Clinton's administration picked up this
idea in setting the tone of its policy toward China.
</P>
<P>
As the scope of non-government contact between China and the
U.S. expands, even more U.S. leaders are paying private visits to
China. They include former government heads, congressional
members, China experts and representatives from non-government
organizations.
</P>
<P>
China also is sending non-government groups to the U.S., such
as a delegation from the Foundation of Poverty Alleviation.
</P>
<P>
Non-governmental exchanges have played a role in increasing
mutual understanding and enhancing trust between China and the
U.S. These exchanges have become an indispensable link in
bilateral relations, according to Mei Zhaorong, president of the
Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs.

</P>
<P>
Figueres' West Point education background was a controversial
theme in the last electoral campaign when he was accused of having

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The second European Week of
Health and Safety at Work will take place from 20 to 25 October
1997, which will focus on the assessment of workplace risks with
particular emphasis on small and medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) has been active in this field, adopting
directives laying down minimum standards for each activity or area
in which risks exist.
</P>
<P>
Speaking today in Brussels, Padraig Flynn, EU commissioner
responsible for employment and social affairs, said, "There are
over 6,000 deaths each year in the European Union from
work-related accidents and injuries."
</P>
<P>
"This is an unacceptable price to pay in human terms.... It is
the result of carelessness, negligence, bad management and
incompetence," he added.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner also said that the EU needed to do more in
order to achieve safer and healthier conditions.
</P>
<P>
The EU has encouraged every employer and every employee to make
a contribution towards implementing this legislation, starting
with a risk assessment.
</P>
<P>
The principal objective of this campaign is to reinforce the
efforts to reduce risks and improve the quality of life by
encouraging effective safety and health management in companies,
promoting measures designed to solve specific problems and reduce
risks and promoting all EU measures in this field.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Trade, Landmines to Dominate Chretien's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien left for a visit to Russia today to further bilateral
trade and seek its signature on the landmine treaty.
</P>
<P>
Chretien said earlier this week that his four-day Russia visit,
starting October 18, will focus on "issues such as the treaty to
ban anti-personnel mines, Canada's economic relations with Russia
and cooperation in the Arctic."
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister will be here to re-establish Canada as a
major trading partner, as a G-7 partner and as a member of many
major international organizations," Canadian ambassador to Russia
Anne Leahy was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Trade between Canada and Russia has been sluggish in recent
years despite repeated vows by their leaders to double trade from
1995 levels by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
Last year, bilateral trade was 781 million dollars (560 million
US dollars). It has increased by 30 percent so far this year,
according to the Canadian government.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Chretien's prime effort is expected to be on
behalf of Bombardier, which is bidding on a Russian contract for
14 executive jets.
</P>
<P>
He will also be pitching Canadian expertise in several planned
Russian megaprojects, including development of a massive gold mine
in Siberia, reports said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the salesman's role, the Canadian prime minister
will press Russian President Boris Yeltsin into signing a treaty
banning anti-personnel landmines.
</P>
<P>
"It's a chance for me to persuade the Russians with our project
to ban landmines in the world," Chretien said before he headed to
Moscow today.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has indicated that Russia would strive to sign the
treaty, which is scheduled for formal ratification here in
December.
</P>
<P>
As Chretien visits Russia, there will be some signing
ceremonies. One of them is for the agreements on northern
aboriginal peoples, and another on cooperation and information
exchanges in criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
After the Russia visit, the Canadian prime minister will fly to
Edinburgh, Scotland, to attend the Commonwealth Heads of
Government Meeting from October 24 to 27.
