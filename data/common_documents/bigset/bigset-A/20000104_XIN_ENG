<HEADLINE> Arafat Hails Palestinian-Israeli Understanding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
hailed the Palestinian-Israeli understanding reached Tuesday on the
Israeli withdrawal from another 5 percent of the West Bank
territories.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Grand Sheikh of Al-Azhar Mohammed Sayd
Tantawi, the top religious leader of Sunni Muslims, here Tuesday,
Arafat said the understanding was another step on the road of the
implementation of Sharm el Sheikh memorandum.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian and Israeli sides are expected to sign later
Tuesday on the maps of the long overdue second phase Israeli
withdrawal for the West Bank lands including Jenin, Naplus and
Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, chief Palestinian negotiator for the interim period
Saeb Erakat told the Voice of Palestine radio Tuesday that the
Palestinian side would accept at last the Israeli-prepared maps on
the redeployment without introducing any changes.
</P>
<P>
He added that the agreement would pave the way for the two sides
to strike a deal on Israel's third troop pullback from another 6.1
percent of the West Bank on January 20.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm el Sheikh memo signed in September, Israel
should withdraw from another 18.1 percent of the West Bank in three
stages that ends in January 20. The first land transfer of 7
percent was carried out on September 10 last year as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
The second handover was set for November 15, but was delayed for
the Palestinians rejected the withdrawal maps, saying the lands
were too sparsely populated and not connected with areas already
under Palestinian self-rule.

<HEADLINE> Greek FM to Visit Cyprus Ahead of Second Cyprus Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Greece's Foreign Minister George
Papandreou will visit Cyprus, a close neighbor and ally, next week,
it was reported here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Papandreou will review the outcome of the
first round U.N.-sponsored proximity talks on Cyprus last December
in New York and the conclusions of the European Union (EU) summit
in Helsinki last month.
</P>
<P>
Discussions will offer the opportunity for the best possible
preparation ahead of the second round of the proximity talks in
Geneva at the end of this month, local media said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' accession course for EU membership will also be part of
the discussions. Cyprus started substantive entry negotiations with
the EU in November 1998 and hoped to be admitted by January 2003.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou, who is to arrive in Cyprus on January 11 on a two-
day visit, will meet with Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides and
Foreign
Minister Ioannis Kasoulides.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Foreign Minister will also meet local party leaders
and address the Cyprus Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
</P>
<P>
This is Papandreou's second visit to Cyprus as foreign minister.
He was here in late November before the start of the proximity
talks and the EU summit.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island after a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
U.N.-sponsored proximity talks between the two communities were
held last month in New York in an effort to pave the way for
finding a Cyprus solution.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Calls for Building World of Ethics and Solidarity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 4 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Tuesday called on the world to draw a lesson from the failure of
the World Trade Organization (WTO) talks in Seattle last month and
engage in building a world on the basis of ethics and solidarity.
</P>
<P>
``Without ethics and solidarity, we will not overcome natural
disasters, we will neither go out of the impasse in the talks on
the protection of our environment nor that of disarmament. We will
not conquer the AIDS and other infectious diseases. We will not
beat the organized crime, drug and terrorism,'' said Chirac in a
speech to the Paris-based diplomatic corps at the Elysee palace.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that the ``Millennium Summit'' to be held
at the United Nations headquarters in New York in September will
be an occasion for discussing ``global management of the inter-
dependence of nations in the interests of all.''
</P>
<P>
``With the ethics of solidarity, we will be able to build a
balanced trade system, taking into account, in the South, the
desire for development, and in the North, the expectations of our
people,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> S. African Bonds Ends Softer on US Bond Weakness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 4 (Xinhua) -- South African bonds ended
 softer on Tuesday, weighed down by the U.S. long bond which lost
some ground as interest rate jitters resurfaced on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said global markets had weakened on the back of the
U.S.. The benchmark 150 rand (25 U.S. dollars) government bond
was last at a yield of 13.255 percent from a previous close of
13.190 percent, off its worst level of 13.300 percent.
</P>
<P>
Bond traders said It has been quite a disappointing day,
considering what is happening internationally. International
markets are in a bearish mood and the Brady Bonds have done quite
badly. The market could correct slightly after hovering around
13.25 percent, said a bond trader.
</P>
<P>
If the underlying bearish undertone remained, traders expected
bonds to retrace and find support between 13.35 percent and 13.40
percent.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. long bond yield spiked to a 28-month high of 6.62
percent on Monday while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost
1.22 percent or 140.23 points to 11,356.89.
</P>
<P>
The market is also awaiting the outcome of the South African
Reserve Bank's monetary policy committee meeting on January 12 for
interest rate direction after the repurchase rate was capped at 12
percent until then.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Continues Search for Equatorial Guinean Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Turkish rescue teams continued the
search for the wreckage of an Equatorial Guinean cargo plane which
was reported to crash last Wednesday around the Goynuk Mountain in
the Black Sea region of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
However, the six rescue units, including 45 military personnel
together with helicopters, planes and vessels and almost 400 people
living in surrounding villages, could not find any trace in their
searches, the Anatolia News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The searches were paused on Monday due to bad weather conditions
and resumed on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian-made Antonov-28 with six crew members aboard from
Ukraine to Equatorial Guinea, went missing shortly after it
requested permission to land in Ankara to refuel.
</P>
<P>
Following the plane's disappearance, the Turkish Naval Forces
began to search at sea and land, but they could not make sure
whether the plane crashed into the Black Sea or in the mountainous
area.
</P>
<P>
An announcement from the General Directorate of State Airport
said that the altitude reading indicated that the plane was losing
control owing to technical failure before it disappeared.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Moderates to Lobby for Ties with Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 4 (Xinhua) -- A group of Iranian moderates on
Tuesday formed a non-governmental organization to lobby for better
relations with Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The Iran-Egypt Friendship Association would encourage the two
countries to normalize bilateral ties to thwart any threats to
Tehran and Cairo, said association spokesman Sabah Zanganeh.
</P>
<P>
He expressed belief that Iran and Egypt can improve relations
and enter into trade cooperation on the basis of mutual respect,
the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
However, Zanganeh said, the association would not put pressure
on the Iranian government to resume full diplomatic ties with
Egypt, but would give proposal to this end as a non-governmental
body.
</P>
<P>
Iran severed relations with Egypt soon after the 1979 Islamic
revolution for its signing of a peace accord with Israel and
sheltering of the toppled Iranian shah. The two now keep interests
sections in each other's capital.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the two countries recently voiced readiness to
normalize full diplomatic ties and reports said that Iranian
Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi will visit Cairo later this month.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian officials have called on Iran to remove the hurdle for
the resumption of ties by changing the name of a main street in
Tehran, which was named after Khaled Islamboli, the assassin of
former Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Cairo's demand, Zanganeh said that as far as he
knew those obstacles would be removed if officials of both
countries decided to normalize ties.
</P>
<P>
Some Iranian officials have called on Egypt to demolish the tomb
of late Iranian shah in Cairo as a condition for Iran to change the
street name.
</P>
<P>
Following the visit by Egyptian Information Minister Muhammad
Safwat Yousuf el-Sharif to Iran last month and continued
negotiations between foreign ministers of the two countries, the
signs of improved relations have come to light, Zanganeh said.
</P>
<P>
He said that "Israel's threat to the regional states and its
efforts to sabotage any peace process" would bring Iran and Egypt
closer.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the Camp David deal (between Egypt and Israel) is
dead now, the Egyptians retook their lands, and the Egyptian nation
has refused to normalize relations with the Israeli regime 20 years
after signing the deal," he added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt became the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with
Israel in 1979, ending decades of hostility. But relations between
them have been tense, which was referred to as "cold peace."
</P>
<P>
Iran opposes any peace deal with the Jewish regime, and called
on Muslims to fight to liberate Jerusalem and the occupied
territories.

<HEADLINE> France, U.S. Dispute Over Adriatic During Kosovo War: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 4 (Xinhua) -- France and the United States
disputed over the French navy deployment in the Adriatic Sea
during the NATO military campaign over Kosovo last Spring, the
daily Le Monde quoted a French parliamentary report as saying on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report, entitled ``Kosovo, a War of Exceptions,'' was
published by the Defense Commission of the French National
Assembly three weeks ago, according to Le Monde.
</P>
<P>
French commander of ``the Task Force 470'' in the Adriatic,
Rear Admiral Alain Coldefy, rejected the U.S. demand that France
pull out its fleet consisting of the aircraft carrier ``Foch,''
two frigates, an oil supply ship and a nuclear attack submarine to
leave their places to American surface ships and submarines.
</P>
<P>
The rejection forced the United States to inform permanently
France and other NATO allies on its firing of cruise missiles
against Yugoslavia throughout the campaign, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the French nuclear attack submarine deployed at the
mouth of the Kotor River in Yugoslavia in order to block the
movement of all Yugoslav warships, also carried out a mission of
reconnaissance on the U.S. missile-firings with other French
warships in the region.
</P>
<P>
A French Defense Ministry report said in November that the
United States conducted a part of its military operation outside
the NATO plan and procedures during the Kosovo war.

according to data provided by the National Center of Social
Research (NCSR) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Macedonian Press Agency (MPA) quoted the NCSR Director
Dionisis Charalambis as saying that the big percentage of
immigrants turned Greece gradually into a multi-cultural society.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people were allowed to enter Greece and live in
lawlessness without guarantees, security or rights, Charalambis
said, adding that this situation of lawlessness is a fertile
ground for crime.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed that the wave of immigrants created xenophobic
tendencies in Greece.
</P>
<P>
The number of refugees in Greece is now estimated at around
800,000 and most of them are from neighboring Albania.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Greek government has taken a series of
measures to deal with this problem.
</P>
<P>
While issuing work permits to some immigrants, Greece has
deported a large number of illegal immigrants.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says to Return to Syrian-Israeli Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton said
on Tuesday that he would return to the Syrian-Israeli peace talks
to help resolve difference on procedural issues.
</P>
<P>
"I'm going back up today and I'm hopeful," Clinton told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The first day of the talks got off to a rocky start, with a
trilateral meeting between Clinton, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Faruouk al-Shara failing to come
off.
</P>
<P>
It was said that the Syrians and Israelis disagree over which
would come first in their negotiations. Syrian negotiators
insisted that they should first discuss an Israeli withdrawal from
the Golan Heights while the Israelis preferred to the security
issue.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he was not disappointed that the trilateral
meeting did not take place on Monday. "That was partly my
decision. We just had a lot of other work to do ... I think they
are both very serious. I think they both want an agreement," he
added.
</P>
<P>
"We just started, but all the issues are on the table, and it's
a pretty full table, as you might imagine. We're working at it,"
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
In advance of Clinton's arrival, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright met with Barak to try to resolve differences between the
two sides over what divisive issue should be negotiated first.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Renominates Greenspan to Lead Fed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With Greenspan at his side in the Oval Office, Clinton ticked
off a list of economic achievements during his administration and
said: "Clearly, wise leadership from the Fed has played a very
large role in our strong economy."
</P>
<P>
It had been widely expected that Clinton would renominate the
highly regarded Greenspan for a fourth term but the timing of the
announcement came as a surprise.
</P>
<P>
The nomination must be confirmed by the Senate but Greenspan, a
Republican, is expected to have little trouble winning approval in
the GOP-controlled Senate.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan, 73, thanked the President for his confidence, and
said: "I first wish to express my deep appreciation to you for the
confidence you have shown in my over the years." The Federal
Reserve "has been a remarkable institution" to work for, he added.
</P>
<P>
He first took over as chairman of the Fed on Aug. 11,1987, when
he was tapped by President Reagan to succeed Paul Volcker.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan has won widespread praise for managing to keep the
lid on prices while allowing the economy to grow at a robust pace
that has driven unemployment to lowest levels in 30 years. He has
had strong support from members of both parties in Congress.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan has also won praise from many economists for his
willingness in recent years to allow the unemployment rate to fall
far below 6 percent, the level that used to be viewed as the
danger point where a dwindling pool of available workers would
trigger higher wage pressures and lead to rising inflation.
</P>
<P>
He was a staunch backer of legislation that Congress passed
last year eliminating barriers that separated banks, investment
firms and insurance companies for more than 60 years.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan was originally chosen as the Fed chairman by
President Reagan in 1987 and was renominated by Presidents Bush
and Clinton. He chaired the Council of Economic Advisers under
President Ford from 1974 to 1977. He also chaired the National
Commission on Social Security Reform, which recommended major
changes to keep the retirement system solvent in 1983.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Economy Up 8 percent in 1999: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The 1999 year saw Russia's
economy unquestionably growing 7.5-8 percent with gross domestic
product up 1.5-2 percent from the previous year, said Russian
First Deputy Economy Minister Arkady Samokhvalov, Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The growths "are easy to check, and there is no slyness behind
these figures," he said, however, stressing that the government
needs to work harder to sustain this apparent growth.
</P>
<P>
"It was not the only basis for the growth that import-replacing
production was developing as a result of a sharp increase in the
cost of imports after August 17, 1998, because real economic
growth had been in evidence in 1997 and in the first half of 1998,
when there was no devaluation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"By the start of last year, certain objective conditions had
been created in Russia for more intensive manufacturing, and
industrial enterprises had adapted to new, market conditions," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Tax reforms and new legislation, including local laws for
protecting investments, and a rise in world oil prices were also
helpful, Samokhvalov said.
</P>
<P>
"The main task for 2000 is to sustain and intensify the
investment process in the country, and also to strengthen the
positive dynamics of the population's consumer demand, a trend for
which appeared in 1999," stated the official.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 4 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Tuesday implicitly condemned the coup d'etat in Cote d'Ivoire and
called for the re-establishment of constitutional order in that
country.
</P>
<P>
In a New Year's good wish speech addressed to the Paris-based
diplomatic corps at the Elysee presidential palace, Chirac said
that in the last days of last year, ``democracy was put to the
test'' in Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
He did not mention the name of Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
``The position of France remains consistent: It condemns the
resort to force and calls for the re-establishment of a
constitutional order respectful of the democratic requests,'' said
Chirac.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the United Nations to help the Democratic
Republic of Congo (D.R.Congo) by ``imposing peace solutions'' to
the country.
</P>
<P>
``The road to peace exists. The agreement of Lusaka has
followed it by deciding with wisdom on the withdrawal of foreign
troops (from D.R. Congo) and national reconciliation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that the Lusaka peace agreement should be
absolutely applied and that the United Nations Security Council
should be engaged in observing the ceasefire and troops withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
He said that France will also present a detailed proposal on an
international conference on the Great Lakes region in Africa to be
held under the joint auspices of the U.N. and the Organization for
African Unity.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Opposition Wants Constitutional Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's opposition Democratic
Party (DP) Tuesday called for an all-party conference to discuss
the draft constitution before it was put to a referendum.
</P>
<P>
DP spokesman Archibald Ncobo said his party would express its
view on the constitution during the meeting with Home Affairs
Minister Dumiso Dabengwa on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The government is expected to hold a referendum in February in
which Zimbabweans will adopt or reject a draft constitution
compiled by the government appointed 400-member commission after
it gathered views from people throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The constitution if adopted will replace the Lancaster House
constitution which Zimbabwe has been using since its independence
in 1980.
</P>
<P>
The DP said it would tell Dabengwa that before the referendum
there is need to call for a national constitutional conference
since there were some organizations which did not accept the
government's draft constitution and were drawing up their own.
</P>
<P>
"We are saying as a way forward all proposed draft
constitutions should be brought to one table and we all come up
with one to be submitted to the referendum," he said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Summons British Envoy over Times' Insulting Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry on
Tuesday summoned the British charge d'affaires Neil Crompton to
protest against "an insulting article" on the London-based daily
Times.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's official in charge of the mass media Morteza
Darzi Ramandi conveyed Iran's strong protest to the British envoy
over the Times article on January 1, which was regarded as
insulting to the late Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Musavi
Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
Ramandi said the Iranian nation and government are sensitive to
desecration of the Islamic values and the Times' affront has
aroused public hatred and disgust, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
He called on the British envoy to make apology for the offense.
</P>
<P>
Crompton said that the stand of the British government is very
clear and is different from what the newspaper has printed.
</P>
<P>
He said the British government is willing to develop cooperation
with Iran and he would convey the concern of the Iranian government
to London.
</P>
<P>
A group of Iranian university students on Monday staged a
protest gathering in front of the British embassy in Tehran,
condemning the newspaper for printing the article.
</P>
<P>
The students called on the British ambassador to apologize to
the Iranian people, stressing that no one accepts an affront under
pretext of freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
They also urged the British government to take action to publish
the paper.

<HEADLINE> A Rabin Memorial Desecrated by Rightists: Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 4 (Xinhua) -- A plaque to commemorate former
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was found damaged Tuesday in
an apparent revenge by some rightwing extremists, Jerusalem police
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Initial reports said that the desecration is related to last
week's demolition of the shrine to Baruch Goldstein, a Jewish
settler who killed 29 kneeling Muslim worshipers in a Hebron mosque
nearly six years ago.
</P>
<P>
Police is investigating Tuesday's incident, in which rightists
also stained nearby areas with anti-Rabin graffiti. However, police
said, the threatened grave of Rabin on Mountain Herzl in Jerusalem
was safe because police had posted guards there.
</P>
<P>
Goldstein, an immigrant from New York who had worked as a
physician in Kiryat Arba settlement near Hebron, belonged to Kach,
a ultranationalist organization.
</P>
<P>
In February 1994, he entered the Tomb of the Patriarchs in
Hebron and opened fire on Muslim worshipers. Goldstein was then
bludgeoned to death by the angry crowd.
</P>
<P>
His grave in Kiryat Arba quickly turned into a site of
pilgrimage for rightwing extremists, who built a shrine with stands
for prayer books, flowerpots and candles.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Israel Defense Forces tore down the shrine, which
was approved by a Knesset law and the High Court of Justice. Since
then, Goldstein supporters threatened to deface the grave of Rabin,
who was assassinated in November 1995 and regarded by most
rightists as criminal of Jew and traitor of Israel.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the grave of Islamic cleric Iza Din al Kassam in the
Muslim cemetery outside Nesher near Haifa had been found desecrated
with red paints, swastikas and slogans.
</P>
<P>
A group calling itself "Friends of Baruch Goldstein" claimed
responsibility for desecrating the grave of Kassam, who was killed
in 1935 while fighting against British rule of Palestine. The
Islamic militant group Hamas named its military wing after Kassam.
</P>
<P>
However, Muslim officials said they would not be provoked into
committing similar acts against Jewish graves, which contravenes
Muslim religious law.
</P>
<P>
"We are not interested in lowering ourselves to this level,"
Nouman Baria, who headed a delegation from the Islamic Trust to the
cemetery, said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli President Under Increasing Pressure to Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 4 (Xinhua) -- President Ezer Weizman has come
under increasing pressure to resign Tuesday as an investigative
journalist made additional allegations over a funding scandal
surrounding him.
</P>
<P>
Yoav Yitzhak, a journalist for the business newspaper Globes,
said that even after being elected president in 1993, Weizman
continued to draw money from an undisclosed fund which he had
received from a French Jewish millionaire.
</P>
<P>
Yitzhak charged that from 1993 to 1995, Weizman and his family
withdrew 65,000 U.S. dollars from a trust account he opened after
receiving 6.5 million dollars from French businessman Eduoard
Seroussi between 1982 and 1984.
</P>
<P>
Yitzhak said Seroussi donated the money to finance the election
campaign of the tiny, now-defunct Yahad party which was established
by Weizman in the early 1980s. He said Weizman deposited hundreds
of thousands of dollars from this fund in his private account.
</P>
<P>
Yitzhak shocked the Israelis last week by revealing that Weizman
accepted 450,000 U.S. dollars, without reporting or paying taxes,
from Seroussi between 1988 and 1993, while he was a member of the
parliament and cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Weizman has admitted that he received the disclosed money from
Seroussi, a long-time friend of his, but said the money was
received only as a nontaxable personal gift before he was elected
president in 1993.
</P>
<P>
His supporter said that the money was used to pay for medical
treatment for his son Shaul, who was seriously wounded in war and
died in a car accident in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The president has promised full cooperation with the State
Attorney's Office, which launched a probe into the matter Monday.
</P>
<P>
Yitzhak said on Tuesday that Weizman was on the verge of
resignation after his disclosure. He said the president would
announce the resignation very soon for health reasons.
</P>
<P>
The president's office vehemently denied that Weizman was
resigning. Israel Radio reported that Weizman has told Prime
Minister Ehud Barak that he had no intention to resign before the
investigation ended.
</P>
<P>
Weizman caused controversy last week after threatening to resign
if a future peace agreement with Syria fails to win a majority
support in a national referendum, which Barak has promised to hold
on any peace accord with Syria or the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Likud party accused the Weizman of
inappropriately meddling in politics and called for his immediate
resignation. In Israel, the post of president is mainly symbolic.
</P>
<P>
The 75-year-old president, who is in his second five-year term,
is a strong advocate of peace between Israel and its Arab
neighbors. He played an important role in the negotiations for
Israel's peace treaty with Egypt, which was signed in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Although Barak has kept silence on the matter, the local daily
Haaretz reported Tuesday that he would back former prime minister
Shimon Peres as a candidate once Weizman leaves office.
</P>
<P>
Peres, minister of regional cooperation in Barak's cabinet, has
played down the speculation that he would soon be the president,
noting that Weizman is to serve another three years.

<P>
NICOSIA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus Stock Exchange (CSE)
was not hit by the millennium computer bug, but by a 2.09-percent
fall in share prices.
</P>
<P>
CSE General Manager Nondas Metaxas said on Tuesday that the CSE
General Index Tuesday closed at 699.07, compared to 713.9 Thursday,
the last working day of 1999.
</P>
<P>
He told press that Tuesday, the first working day of the new
year, the CSE electronic systems operated "with no problems at
all."
</P>
<P>
Stavros Agrotis, vice president of Cyprus' Stockbrokers
Association, attributed Tuesday's fall partly to investors'
tendency towards companies seeking listing in the CSE. The "
prospects for the year 2000 are good," he said.
</P>
<P>
In 2000, he explained, a number of listed companies are expected
to record high profits, the economy of both Cyprus and its close
neighbor Greece are "in the right course" while some CSE companies
are expected to be listed in the Athens Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
The year 1999 has been called "the year of the Stock Exchange"
in Cyprus as the General Index ranged below and above 700 in
December last year from around 90 in the last sessions of 1998.

NICOSIA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has tightened security of
the Russian embassy and other Russian interests here to prevent
possible terrorist attacks, the Cyprus News Agency (CNA) reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus Justice and Public Order Minister Nicos Koshis said "
there is information that during this period certain Islamic and

Asked if security measures have been stepped up in Cyprus since
Monday's attack against the Russian Embassy in Beirut, Koshis

supplementary information."
</P>
<P>
Islamic militants fired bullets and grenades at the Russian
embassy in Beirut to revenge Russian military operation in
Chechnya. A Lebanese policeman and an assailant were killed, and
several passers-by were injured, in the exchange of fire.

<P>
"We are taking various measures," Koshis added without

ATHENS, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Greece Tuesday began an ambitious

<HEADLINE> Swiss National Bank Profit in 1999 Almost Doubled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The profit of the Swiss National
Bank (SNB reached 4.4 billion Swiss francs in 1999, nearly twice
as much as that in 1998 (2.4 billion francs), said the SNB in a
press release Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The SNB attributed the results largely to currency gains
against the Swiss franc, saying that the US dollar had jumped in
value from 1.3772 Swiss francs at the end of 1998 to 1.5980 francs
at the end of last year and that this had played a major
contribution to filling the coffers.
</P>
<P>
Currency exchange rates accounted for a profit of 4.1 billion
last year, with all major currencies hardening against the franc,
except the euro. A weaker US dollar in 1998 had the opposite
effect, with exchange rates accounting for a book loss of 900
million francs.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Africa Faces Challenges of Globalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Struggling to get rid of the
long lasting poverty and catch up with the rest of the world,
Africa is gearing up their full efforts to meet the challenges
resulting from the torrential wave of globalization.
</P>
<P>
Globalization is "like a giant wave that can either capsize
nations or carry them forward", said Joseph Stiglitz, World Bank
Chief Economist and Senior Vice President.
</P>
<P>
As elsewhere, globalization means both opportunities and
challenges for sub-Saharan African countries, but challenge is
more of the nature at present when their economies are so weak and
vulnerable. It carries the threats of economic and political
instability that can erode years of hard- earned gains.
</P>
<P>
Though African countries have struggled in the past decade to
integrate their economies into the global trading and financial
system, increased globalization has not brought about the desired
economic growth but resulted in hefty external deficits and
heightened instability.
</P>
<P>
Globalization have plunged African countries into an even more
unfair trading system, highlighted by worsening trading terms and
depressed prices of primary products.
</P>
<P>
Thus, African exports represented 5.9 percent of the world
total exports in 1980, that share decreased to three percent in
1990 and 2.3 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Market-opening has invited the flooding-in of foreign products,
which seriously threatened the existence and development of the
local industries.
</P>
<P>
A large number of enterprises across the continent have
collapsed or in the red under the unprincipled competition brought
about by globalization, with the textile and agricultural sectors
having been hit most.
</P>
<P>
The developed countries adopted protectionism against African
products by abusing anti-dumping and health and safety standards,
thus making the continent impossible to fully exploit its
potential advantage.
</P>
<P>
In low technology industries alone, developing economies are
losing an additional 700 billion U.S. dollars in annual exports
earnings as a result of the increasing protectionism tendencies of
the developed world. This represents at least four times the
average annual private foreign capital inflows in the 1990s
including foreign direct investments.
</P>
<P>
Africa has found itself increasingly marginalized in the world
economy with the development of globalization and liberalization.
This includes expanding trading imbalance, deeper debt crisis and
increasing social poverty.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa said globalization has not
only affected the least developed countries' position in the world
economic policies but also their economic sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Globalization is actually helping world giant companies to take
control of Africa's economy and reap undue profits from the
continent by exploiting its labor, natural resources and markets
with unreasonably low expense.
</P>
<P>
In the wave of globalization, the giants have developed into a
strong power beyond the control of the state and makes it hard for
African governments to arrest capital and commodity flow against
foreign speculations.
</P>
<P>
Under the pressure of globalization, more and more African
countries have realized that they must come up with measures to
minimize its negative effect and reap benefits from it.
</P>
<P>
African countries have intensified their efforts in economic
reform and commodity diversification in a bid to increase their
participation in the globalizing world.
</P>
<P>
They are urging developed countries to reduce protectionism and
trade barriers for a fairer international trading system.
</P>
<P>
In order to expand market for their products, African countries
are speeding up their regional economic integration process.
Regional integration is also very important for the continent to
protect its vulnerable indigenous companies in the fierce global
competition.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi has called on
the continent to find ways and means of creating the necessary
conditions for itself to share the benefits of the global economy
in an equitable and fair manner.
</P>
<P>
In the new century, globalization will surely accelerate its
steps and offer a mix of opportunities and risks for Africa. How
to avoid being engulfed by the tide of globalization and reap
benefits from it is a major task facing the African continent.

<HEADLINE> Dry Spell Hits Crops in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 4 (Xinhua) -- About two-thirds of crops in
Zimbabwe have been adversely affected by the prolonged dry spell
that started from the middle of last December up to the new year,
the Zimbabwe Farmers Union said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
President of the Union Silas Hungwe said that the dry spell
came at a time when most crops were still in need of more
rainfall.
</P>
<P>
The most affected crops are maize, the country's staple food
and tobacco, Zimbabwe's biggest foreign currency earner, Hungwe
said.
</P>
<P>
However, the recent rains that fell in some parts of the
country had also brought a trail of disaster as hail storm had
destroyed tobacco and maize crops in some parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Hungwe advised farmers not to continue planting the
conventional dry- land crops like maize, cotton, groundnuts and
soya beans to avoid unnecessary losses.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Junior Doctors Strike Enters into 15th Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The strike by junior doctors in
Zambia University Teaching Hospital, the biggest hospital in the
country, entered its 15th day Tuesday despite the suspension
already imposed on them.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government has imposed suspension the striking
doctors, placing them under half pay and forbidding them to leave
the country and take leave from duty unless they are sick.
</P>
<P>
The Zambia Congress of Trade Unions Tuesday called for an
immediate lifting of suspension on the junior doctors countrywide.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-general of the congress Sylvester Tembo said in a
press statement that the suspension of doctors amounted to
violation of worker's rights.
</P>
<P>
Calling on the government to find money for the face-lift of
health institutions, Tembo said the doctors started complaining
about the poor situation and conditions of service early last year
but nothing tangible has happened.
</P>
<P>
The Zambia University Teaching Hospital has mobilized medical
personnel from other institutions to help attend to patients.
</P>
<P>
The personnel include consultants, doctors and clinical
officers from institutions within and outside Lusaka as an interim
measure while the problem is being looked into by the Ministry of
Health.
</P>
<P>
The junior doctors, who compose most part of all the doctors in
the hospital in Lusaka, went on strike on December 21, demanding
improved conditions of service including salaries and allowances.
</P>
<P>
They went on strike also in protest against lack of essential
drugs, medical and surgical supplies in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
Later the junior doctors in other cities like Ndola and Kitwe
joined them.

<HEADLINE> Constantinescu: Romania to Better Ties With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Romania will take steps to
strengthen ties with Israel and enhance bilateral economic
cooperations, said visiting Romanian President Emil Constantinescu
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Romania attaches great importance to the relationship with
Israel, and to enhance bilateral cooperation will be beneficial to
the peoples of the two countries, Constantinescu said after holding
talks with Israel's acting Prime Minister Yitzhak Mordechai.
</P>
<P>
He also said that he will try his best to seek an early release
of 13 Jews held by the Iranian authorities, as asked by Israel. The
Romanian government could provide its help in his regard since it
has good relations with Iran, he added.
</P>
<P>
The 13 Jews were arrested by the Iranian authorities several
months ago on charges for spying for Israel and the United States.
Iran has said they will receive fair trials under the Iranian law.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian president arrived here Monday for a three-day
visit, along with attending celebrations for the coming of the new
millennium organized by local Christian churches.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, he was received by Israeli President Ezer Weizman.
The two leaders exchanged views on bilateral and regional issues,
particularly issues concerning the ongoing Middle East peace
process, Weizman's office said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Construction Spending Rises Sharply in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Commerce Department reported Tuesday that the November gain
was led by big increases in spending on housing, commercial
buildings and highways. It followed three straight months of
declines in construction spending.
</P>
<P>
November's report showed widespread gains in both private and
government building.
</P>
<P>
Private construction spending increased by 1.7 percent to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 549.8 billion dollars. The
strength included a 1.1 percent surge in residential projects,
with both single-family homes and apartment building showing
increases.
</P>
<P>
Nonresidential activity was up an even stronger 3.3 percent,
led by a big 9.1 percent jump in spending in a category that
includes commercial structures.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, government construction spending rose 5.3 percent to
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 165.3 billion dollars.
Spending on highways jumped 11.5 percent while spending for
educational buildings picked up 5.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the increases pushed total construction spending to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 715.1 billion dollars in
November, 5.1 percent higher than the level in November 1998 of
680.1 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said many signs of strong economic activity, including
today's construction report, would likely prompt the Federal
Reserve to raise interest rates again, probably at its next
meeting in February.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Troops Enter, Leave Somali Border Town: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of heavily armed
Ethiopian troops crossed into Somali border town of Goldogob of
the central Mudug region and left the town Monday, according to
VHF radio reports from Goldogob.
</P>
<P>
It was not confirmed by the Ethiopian side.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian troops equipped with tanks, artillery guns and
armed personnel carriers, moved into the town without firing a
single shot, according to one radio operator who asked for
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopians then pulled back their troops Monday afternoon
and spent the night outside the town.
</P>
<P>
One of the businessmen in the town said Tuesday that the
Ethiopians have totally deserted the area, but no one knows where
they had headed for.
</P>
<P>
Well-guarded Ethiopian officials summoned the elders of the
town, asking if there were politicians from the Somali National
Democratic Union faction leaders for consultation.
</P>
<P>
However, one of the elders who had met the Ethiopian troops
said they have been looking for members from the Islamic
fundamentalist organization of Al-Itihiad Al-Islam.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here believe that the Ethiopians' cross
border move was really motivated by a 15-page report published by
head of the Puntland regional administration, Colonel Abdullahi
Yussuf Ahmed.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed has accused the Al-Itihad of making plans to destabilize
Puntland and other parts of Somalia and the east African region as
a whole. The Islamic organization is allegedly active in
Goldogob, Balanbal, Burtinleh and other towns close to the border
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The report claimed that recruitment now continues along those
places by the Al-Itihad men to create a hostile atmosphere between
Somalia and Ethiopia.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Members Urged to Remove Trade Barriers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) Tuesday called on all member countries to
quickly remove all the barriers to trade and investment in order
to achieve a free trade area by October 31.
</P>
<P>
COMESA Secretary-General Erastus Mwencha said that the
achievement of a free trade area would be a major milestone in
creating a viable market for trade and investment in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mwencha made the remarks when new Egyptian Ambassador to Zambia
Abdel Hussein El Dib, who has also been appointed permanent
representative of Egypt to COMESA, presented his credentials at
COMESA headquarters in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
Mwencha pointed out that COMESA, being a major building block
of the proposed African economic community, could only achieve its
economic potential through economic integration.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA official commended Egypt for being in the fore front
of implementing COMESA programs since it joined the regional group
in February 1999, noting that trade and economic ties have
continued to grow.
</P>
<P>
Mwencha also thanked Egypt for offering to host a major
regional economic conference on February 28 and 29 this year.
</P>
<P>
He said the COMESA conference would focus on trade and
investment opportunities in COMESA region.
</P>
<P>
Mwencha also called on the business community to take advantage
of this opportunity to promote investments in all sectors
including manufacturing, energy, tourism and transport.
</P>
<P>
Hussein El Dib stressed the need for cooperation among COMESA
members if a free trade area is to be achieved this year.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's exports to other COMESA member countries have more than
doubled since it joined the regional market grouping.

<HEADLINE> Flu Bug Hits Central Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Central Canada is being hit by a
"Y2K bug" in the form of influenza A with the emergency room
crunch reported since the weekend.
</P>
<P>
At one point, nearly all hospitals in Greater Toronto Area were
closed Monday even to the sickest patients, the country's CTV
television said Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Similar ERs crunch happened in Montreal, where some patients
had to lie down on the stretches as long as 48 hours before being
able to see a doctor, local reports said.
</P>
<P>
The country's earliest ERs crunch was reported in Vancouver in
December, when city hospitals were busy managing critical-care
bypass for ward beds.
</P>
<P>
In late December, the Ontario provincial government announced a
package of 196 million Canadian dollars (about 135 million U.S.
dollars to boost hospitals in the country's richest province.
</P>
<P>
Most ERs should become unclogged in the second week of January,
when the provincial government of Quebec will spend 8 million
Canadian dollars (about 5.5 million U.S. dollars) in paying for
more staff and extra beds, said Laureanne Collin of the Montreal
Regional Health Board.
</P>
<P>
Canada's federal infectious diseases unit warned in October
last year that as many as 51,000 Canadians could die in a global
flu outbreak predicted to hit within five to 10 years, unless
Canada could quickly mass-produce a vaccine by the time the virus
attacks.
</P>
<P>
There are several types of flu viruses being reported at this
time of the year in Canada as a result of weird pattern of weather,
local reports said, warning that even with a shot of vaccine, one
may expose to attacks by varied "flu bugs".

<HEADLINE> China's Young Stars Shine at World Cup Short-course Swimming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese young swimmers scooped
13 out of 17 gold medals on Tuesday, leaving four golds to Hungary,
Canada, Mexico and the United States on the first day of FINA
World Cup short-course meet Shanghai leg.
</P>
<P>
Qi Hui, who completed a golden hat-trick at Brazil leg last
November, won the women's 100 meters breaststroke with a personal-
best time in one minute 07.50 seconds, 0.49 seconds faster than
the runner-up Li Wei of China.
</P>
<P>
But the 14-year-old Qi, a strong medal contender in the
breaststroke vent at the Sydney Olympics, said the 100m is not her
favorite. "I prefer the 200m to the sprint because my rhythm is
more suitable for the longer distance. " Qi said.
</P>
<P>
"It's my personal-best which is almost one second faster than
the result I swam in Brazil."
</P>
<P>
In the women's 200m individual medley, Zhang Shu led all the
way to upset the world record holders Wu Yanyan and Chen Yan, also
from China, with a time of 2:11.11.
</P>
<P>
Chen finished second in 2:12.03, and Wu came in a distant
fifth with 2:17.65.
</P>
<P>
Chen, 19, who suffered gastroptosis for more than one year,
was satisfied with her result after a hectic journey between
Canada and Brazil at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
"I had suffered gastroptosis for more than one year and I
improved my result to 2:13.81 in Brazil. I will comeback," said
Chen, world record holder and world champion in 400m medley.
</P>
<P>
The two-day event features a few of outside-China swimmers
participating, with only four took home the gold medals.
</P>
<P>
In the men's 400m freestyle, the only event China failed to
take a medal, American veteran Carvin Chad beat Szbdos Bela of
Hungary and Italy's Gallina Moreno to clinch the gold medal,
timing 3:45.47.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Stefanyshyn Kelly took the crown in the women's 200m
backstroke in 2:10.12, edging China's Zhan Shu and Tao Xuan into
second and third.
</P>
<P>
Hungarian Bela added to the victory in the men's 100m
freestyle to his medal tally, with a winning time of 49.09. Bela
was followed by China's Deng Qingsong and Brazil's Jayme Carlos.
</P>
<P>
Veloz Juan Jost of Mexico won the men's 200m butterfly in 1:57.
33, Italy's Eroli Hassiminano was second in 1:57.83 with China's
Zhang Zhi third in 1:59.05.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique's Poll Results Effective: Supreme Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican Supreme Court
Tuesday ruled that the results of the general elections held from
December 3 to 5, 1999, are effective.
</P>
<P>
The presidential and parliamentary elections were free, fair
and transparent, the court said. Thus, the poll results announced
by the National Elections Committee on December 22 are effective.
</P>
<P>
According to the officially announced results, the ruling
Mozambique Liberation Front Party (Frelimo) won 48.54 percent of
the votes while incumbent President Joaquim Chissano beat his sole
rival Afonso Dhlakama by winning 52.29 percent of the votes in the
second multi-party elections since 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican National Resistance (Renamo), the biggest
opposition party, accused the Frelimo of rigging in the polls.
</P>
<P>
Demanding a recount, the Renamo took the case on December 23 to
the Supreme Court which has the final say in electoral disputes.
The court then made investigations into the case.
</P>
<P>
The nine-judge Supreme Court noted that the accusation made by
the opposition is groundless.
</P>
<P>
General Secretary of the Frelimo Manuel Tome urged the Renamo
to show respect for the results announced by the National
Elections Committee and the ruling of the court.

<HEADLINE> Russia Urges Lebanon to Prevent Repetition of Embassy Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Russia strongly urged Lebanon to
prevent a repetition of Monday's Beirut incident and requested a
security guarantee for its citizens in the Middle East country,
the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A 31-year-old pro-Chechen Palestinian, Ahmed Abou Kharoub,
opened fire and launched grenades at the Russian embassy in Beirut
from a nearby residential building early Monday, killing a
Lebanese policeman and wounding several others. No one on the
staff inside the embassy was injured.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese security forces stormed the building and shot Kharoub
dead, seizing hand grenades, Kalashnikov rifles and other weapons.
</P>
<P>
"Moscow proceeds from the assumption that a repetition of
criminal acts, which might be detrimental to traditionally
friendly relations between Russia and Lebanon, will be ruled out,"
said the Russian Foreign Ministry statement.
</P>
<P>
The Russian leadership expressed serious concern over the
incident, describing it as "a barbaric act against the Russian
diplomatic mission that put the lives of the Russian staff under
threat," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
A note of protest against the incident had been handed to the
Lebanese charge d'affairs in Moscow Monday, according to the
Russian Foreign Ministry's Information and Press Department.
</P>
<P>
Russia demanded the Lebanese authorities immediately take all
the necessary measures to ensure the security of Russian citizens
and institutions in Lebanon, said the note.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese charge d'affairs expressed deep regret over the
incident and said the terrorist act was targeted against the joint
interests of Russia and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Lebanese authorities would do everything
possible to protect the Russian citizens and diplomatic mission.

<HEADLINE> Bank of England Has No Other Choice In Controlling Inflation:George </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Bank of England Governor Eddie
George has rejected suggestions that monetary policy should be
tailored to take account of the differing economic trends across
Britain.
</P>
<P>
George said the Bank had no choice in the matter as interest
rates were "the only tool or club" at his disposal to control
inflation.
</P>
<P>
The governor told BBC Radio 4's Today program that any move to
protect particular regions or sectors of the economy could
jeopardize the economy as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee has raised rates twice in
the last few months in response to rising house prices and
consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
However, some businesses and unions have called for a
reconsideration of policy, saying the use of short term interest
rates is a blunt tool which may be necessary to cool the booming
economy in the South East, but has hit other areas hard.
</P>
<P>
George said the Bank's mandate from the government was in
relation to the economy as a whole, not particular sectors.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the stock market and the huge rise in
technology share prices, George said the revolution in information
technology had contributed to improvements in productivity,
especially in the United States.
</P>
<P>
However, he said this would "not mean we can relax." Prices
can still get ahead of themselves and some companies were likely
to fail while other succeeded, he added.
</P>
<P>
More than 43,000 companies were made bankrupt or went into
liquidation last year as they suffered the effects of economic
slowdown, according to figures published Tuesday by Dun &AMP;
Bradstreet, a business advisory company.

WASHINGTON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>

dangerous conflicts.
</P>
<P>
-- A confidential evaluation by the Pentagon warns that plans
to cut the Navy's fleet of attack submarines -- already down

officials said.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- In campaign appearances 1,125 miles apart, former Senator
Bill Bradley and Vice President Al Gore argued about the virtues

<P>
The Wall Street Journal:

</P>
<P>

MADRID, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Madrid mayor Jose Maria Alvarez

</P>
<P>
"We are definitely going to bid for the Olympics, that's for

</P>
<P>
Seville was the Spanish candidate for the 2004 Games and is

<P>
URUMQI, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Snowslide accidents have resulted
in at least two deaths and one injured in Xinjiang's Ili
Prefecture after six days of heavy snow. Highway 218 has
temporarily closed to avoid further possible accidents.
</P>
<P>
According to Lu Guoying, a senior engineer from the Xinjiang
Meteorological Bureau, the snowstorm covered all 27 counties in
Xinjiang and was the heaviest fall of snow in the late five years.
</P>
<P>
In the capital city of Urumqi, almost 40 mm of high snow
caused serious traffic jams. Many local residents helped remove
piled snow. Food supplies were plentiful during the six day period.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that the snowstorm which was due to strong cold winds
from West Siberia, has almost abated, but temperatures will
continue to drop until January 7.
</P>
<P>
According to some experts, the snowstorm will affect
transportation, vegetable production and stockbreeding in Xinjiang.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Free 22 Lebanese Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Israel will release 22 Lebanese
inmates in the next 48 hours from the Khiam Prison inside the
Israeli occupation zone in south Lebanon, the People's Voice radio
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The deal is brokered by the International Committee of the Red
Cross (ICRC), the radio added.
</P>
<P>
Maher Tufiaili, Lebanon's representative to the five-nation
Monitoring Group which oversees the cease-fire between Israel and
Lebanon, had informed Lebanese President Emile Lahoud and Prime
Minister Salim Hoss of the release.
</P>
<P>
The prisoners to be released would be brought to Beirut in an
ICRC bus from Khiam prison, which is reportedly still holding over
100 Lebanese prisoners for collaborating with Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Israel established a self-styled security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, backed by Syria and Iran, is leading
a guerrilla war trying to oust Israeli occupation troops out of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The release is the second in less than one month, with the first
batch of five freed in December.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli move is widely seen as a goodwill gesture as its
Prime Minister Ehud Barak is in the U.S. for the second round of
peace talks with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa, which
began on January 3.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks resumed in Washington on December 15 after a
break of almost four years.
</P>
<P>
Syria, with 35,000 troops stationed in Lebanon, is an undisputed
power broker in the country and Lebanon is closely following
Syria's foreign policy, especially in the Mideast peace process.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Gaddafi's Remarks Over Disputed Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Hamid Reza Asefi Tuesday expressed "surprise" at the recent remarks
made by Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi over the three disputed
islands in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi said in an interview with the Dubai Television of the
United Arab Emirates recently that the Iranian government had sent
him a message after the 1979 Islamic revolution regarding the
disputed islands of Abu Musa, the Greater and Lesser Tunbs.
</P>
<P>
He said the message indicated that Iran would hand over the
three islands to the UAE provided that Abu Dhabi would not allow
the United States to use the islands.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iranian spokesman said that "the Iranian government
has not sent any message to any official or non-official persons in
this respect," the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Asefi re-asserted his country's claim that the three islands
are "inseparable parts of the Iranian territory and will remain
so."
</P>
<P>
Iran took over the three small but strategic islands in early
1970s after British forces withdrew from the region. However, both
Iran and the UAE claimed full sovereignty over the islands.
</P>
<P>
During the past years, the UAE repeatedly called for
international arbitration to settle the dispute, but Iran insisted
on bilateral talks.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestinians Reach Agreement on Redeployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators reached an agreement here Tuesday on Israel's long-
delayed second troop redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which outlines Israel's handover of another 5
percent of the West Bank territories to the Palestinians, was
reached between Israeli chief negotiator on interim issues Oded
Eran and his Palestinian counterpart Saeb Erakat.
</P>
<P>
"The two sides would sign the maps outlining the withdrawal
later Tuesday and that the pullback would take place within 48
hours," Erakat told reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He added that the agreement would pave the way for the two sides
to strike a deal on Israel's third troop pullback from the West
Bank scheduled on January 20 according to the latest peace deal
signed early last September.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, Israel should withdraw from another 18.1 percent
of the West Bank in three stages than ends in January 20. The first
land transfer of 7 percent was carried out on September 10 last
year as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Israel was supposed to carry out the second redepolyment on
November 15, but the pullback was delayed due to the differences
between the two sides over which territories to be handed over.
</P>
<P>
Erakat did not indicate the areas to be handed over to the
Palestinians, but said the Israeli side has accept the demands put
forward by the Palestinian side, which asked for more densely
populated areas in the land transfer.
</P>
<P>
Two of the 5 percent land will be transferred from Area B, in
which Israel controls security and Palestinians have civil
administration to Area A, or full Palestinian rule, and 3 percent
from Area C under total Israeli control to Area B.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Leader Sees Greater Confidence in Government in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Buoyed by the prospects of a
better economy for the year 2000, Philippine President Joseph
Estrada expressed optimism Tuesday that his administration can "
come back strong" this year.
</P>
<P>
The president told a meeting that the improved performance of
the peso against the U.S. dollar during the first trading day of
the year is a positive indication that investor confidence in the
Philippine economy remains high.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine peso ended its first trading day for the year at
39.98 to the dollar, its highest closing level since September 15.
</P>
<P>
"We are in control and I could predict that our economy will
greatly improve this year," the president said.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to a poll that the level of the people's
satisfaction with the government declined to a negative 8 percent
last month, the president said: "We'll come back strong."
</P>
<P>
Estrada said Filipinos can expect a more vibrant future this
year as shown by an improving economy.
</P>
<P>
"Even if oil prices increased, the prices of basic commodities
did not. This shows that our economy is getting stronger," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Socio-Economic Planning Secretary Felipe Medalla
said the Philippines remains on track in its target to achieve a 4-
percent growth in its gross domestic product (GDP) in the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
The country's GDP growth was recorded at 2.6 percent as of the
first nine months of 1999 while the growth of the gross national
product reached 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Medalla noted that the economy in 1999 alone was already a big
improvement over 1998, with all sectors recovering except the
capital-intensive construction industry.

<HEADLINE> Pak Accuses India of Building Artificial Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Abdul Sattar Tuesday charged that India was building "artificial
tension" through accusing Pakistan of involvement in the case of
hijacking an Indian Airlines plane.
</P>
<P>
While talking to reporters here, Sattar said India's accusation
is aimed at isolating Pakistan in the international community but
the "frustrated move" is bound to fail.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan will remain in the mainstream of the international
community and India will fail to implicate Pakistan in the
hijacking," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee Monday claimed that
the hijacking in December is "an integral part of Pakistan-backed
terrorist activities" and asked the world to declare Pakistan a "
terrorist state."
</P>
<P>
The Indian government, Sattar said, has not a shred of evidence
to prove that any Pakistani national was aboard the hijacked plane.
</P>
<P>
He said India had earlier thanked Pakistan for handling the
hijacking drama but suddenly they started leveling allegations. "
It has exposed Indian sinister designs to implicate Pakistan in
false accusations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sattar said that during the hijack episode Pakistan acted in
accordance with international aviation laws and humanitarian norms
keeping in view the safety of the passengers.
</P>
<P>
The Airbus-300 plane, with more than 180 people on board, was
hijacked on Christmas Eve and landed in Pakistan's border city of
Lahore, where it was refueled and provided with food, before
taking off again.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Elephants are source of concern
in some parts of Zambia, making farmers fearful of going to the
fields, Times of Zambia newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The worst hit areas include Ialanda in Itezhi-Tezhi district,
Southern Province, where villagers are now being forced to stay
indoors early as 6: 00 p.m., the report said.
</P>
<P>
The villagers are worried that if the situation is not promptly
 addressed, they risk starving themselves as there would be no
production in the area due to the threats posed by elephants.
</P>
<P>
The increased number of elephants has been attributed to the
rampant poaching in the Kaoma area which is forcing the animals to
flee in large numbers towards Itezhi-Tezhi district, the report
said.

<HEADLINE> "People's Daily" Editorial on Tasks For The New Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 4 (Xinhua) -- An editorial to be carried by
the "People's Daily" tomorrow calls on the whole country to have a
clear understanding of its domestic situation and tasks that must
be dealt with in the new year.
</P>
<P>
The editorial titled "Get a Clear Understanding of the Current
Situation and Clearly Define The Tasks That Lay Ahead", says that
as the world will still encounter numerous difficulties in the new
millennium, it is important that China has a clear understanding
of its domestic situation and define clearly the tasks that must
be dealt with in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Political multipolarization and economic globalization will
continue to develop. Driven by worldwide economic restructuring
and fast development of modern science and technology, the
international politics and economy are undergoing profound changes.
</P>
<P>
Despite these changes, peace and development will continue to
be of paramount concern in the new century, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
"We must have a greater sense of urgency to make China
economically stronger and improve national defense and enhance
national cohesion," it says.
</P>
<P>
While social stability and national unity are strong in China,
the country also faces numerous deep-rooted problems and a number
of challenges arising from economic reform and adverse influences
of global economic fluctuation.
</P>
<P>
The editorial states that China should concentrate on
developing productivity and deal with all kinds of conflicts
tactfully to best resolve problems.
</P>
<P>
All members of the Communist Party of China (CPC) must
understand the true spirit of the CPC Central Committee in their
daily work activities. This will guarantee that the guidelines and
main tasks for economic work in the new year will be accomplished,
the editorial says.

Kong must ensure that all students are information technology IT)
literate with some of them having the potential to become leaders
in the field, said Joseph W P Wong, secretary for education and
manpower, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks while addressing the 13th International
Congress for School Effectiveness and Improvement attended by some
900 representatives from 20 economies.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the education needs of Hong Kong in the new
millennium to respond to the challenges of the future world and
highlighted five priority areas of Hong Kong's education needs.
</P>
<P>
Besides IT education, Wong said, the education system must
nurture the students to develop the aptitude to learn continuously,
because the defining feature of a knowledge-based economy is the
fast and continuous emergence of new ideas in all sectors which
requires people to respond quickly.
</P>
<P>
"Thirdly, our education system must equip our children with
good communication skills. The world is becoming increasingly
globalized. To exploit the potentials of this trend, we need
international citizens who have a global outlook and to appreciate
other values and cultures.
</P>
<P>
"The fourth, our education system needs a dedicated and
professional teaching force.
</P>
<P>
"Finally, there must be flexibility in the education system to
promote diversity and excellence, and nurture creativity in our
students. The system must allow room for schools and educators to
innovate, and to respond to the changing demands of parents," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Wong said the importance which the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region government attaches to education is best
illustrated by the fact that education is the single biggest item
of public expenditure.
</P>
<P>
"In this financial year, we will be spending 55 billion HK
dollars (7.05 billion U.S. dollars) on education, taking up about
20 percent of total government expenditure," he said.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, the secretary for education and manpower also
briefly introduced Hong Kong's latest developments in the areas of
IT in education, making Hong Kong a learning society, improving
the languages standard of Hong Kong people, enhancing the quality
of principals and teachers, and promoting diversity and excellence
in the education system.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong to Review Legal Education, Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 4 (Xinhua) -- A comprehensive review of
legal education and training in Hong Kong will be conducted to
advise on the requirements of a system best capable of meeting the
challenges of legal practice and the needs of Hong Kong society in
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the plan at a press conference Tuesday, Acting
Solicitor General Robert Allcock, who chairs a working group on
the review of legal education, said the review would be carried
out in two stages, a consultancy stage to be followed by a further
study by a review panel.
</P>
<P>
The working group, established in July last year to decide on
the way forward in reviewing the legal education in Hong Kong,
includes representatives from the Law Society, the Bar Association,
the University of Hong Kong, and the City University of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In the light of best international practice and having regard
to the unique characteristics of Hong Kong, the review intends to
assess the current system of legal education and training in Hong
Kong and to provide a set of benchmarks for measuring the quality
and standard of legal education.
</P>
<P>
The working group will also provide suggestions and alternative
models for a reformed system of training and make recommendations
for improvements in the system of legal education.
</P>
<P>
Allcock said the consultants will arrive in Hong Kong in mid-
January to meet with representatives of various bodies including
the Consumer Council, law students, labor and social services
groups and the financial services sector.
</P>
<P>
"These meetings will help them to draw up a comprehensive list
of the issues concerning legal education and training in Hong Kong
which will later be the subject of an issues paper for
consultation among the legal sector and the public at large.
</P>
<P>
"The final report incorporating contributions from various
sectors and recommendations will then be prepared and submitted to
the working group in February 2001 for its consideration. The
second stage of the review will then begin," he added.

<HEADLINE> HK Patent Applications Gain Priority in Mainland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The short-term patent
application or a design registration application in Hong Kong now
enjoys the right of priority when filing an application for a
patent or design in the Patent Office of the State Intellectual
Property Office (IPO), according to the Intellectual Property
Department (IPD) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (
HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
Stephen Selby, director of intellectual property of Hong Kong,
said Tuesday that the decision to give priority rights to Hong
Kong applications follows consultations between the State IPO and
the HKSAR IPD over the past year or so.
</P>
<P>
"This demonstrates successful cooperation between the
intellectual property authorities in the mainland and the HKSAR,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
Following a first application to the Hong Kong IPD, if the
applicant files a patent or registered design application for the
same invention or patent in the mainland within a certain time
limit (12 months and six months for short-term patent applications
and registered design applications respectively), he is entitled
to claim the date of his first application in Hong Kong as the
date of filing the application.
</P>
<P>
This is important because in both Hong Kong and the mainland, a
patent will be granted to the first person to file a valid patent
application.
</P>
<P>
A person who wants to make a patent or design application in
the mainland following an application in Hong Kong must make a
written declaration to that effect when the mainland application
is filed.
</P>
<P>
Also, a copy of the short-term patent application or the
registered design registration application document certified by
the IPD of Hong Kong must be filed with the Patent Office of the
State IPO within three months.

<HEADLINE> Philippines May Announce Cabinet Revamp in 10 Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Tuesday that he may announce changes in his cabinet
within 10 days as he stressed that he has yet to make a final
decision on the issue.
</P>
<P>
He said in a radio interview that he is still studying the
matter carefully.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing is certain yet. I have not yet made any choices. I
still haven't decided on the changes so I'm still not considering
any replacement. Maybe you will know in 10 days," the president
said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada made this statement in reaction to reports on several
replacements allegedly being eyed for some cabinet members.
</P>
<P>
The president made it clear earlier that he had made an
assessment of the qualifications and fitness of government
officials to help ensure that his administration is delivering
faster and better services to the people.
</P>
<P>
He had required all members of the cabinet to turn in their
individual performance reports as part of his yearly audit of what
his administration has done in implementing his pro-poor programs.
</P>
<P>
Estrada had announced during a pre-New Year party that he will
make public his decision regarding his cabinet in the first week
of January.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that at least four cabinet members were
among the revamp list, namely, Interior Secretary Ronaldo Puno,
Tourism Secretary Gemma Cruz-Araneta, Public Works Secretary
Gregorio Vigilar and presidential spokesman Fernando Barican.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan in No Hurry to Decide on CTBT: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Abdul Sattar Tuesday said his government is in no hurry to decide
whether it will sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) or
not.
</P>
<P>
He said further that Pakistan will still have the option to
conduct a nuclear test if another country did so even after
signing the CTBT.
</P>
<P>
"If another country conducts tests, Pakistan's option to do the
same remains open, irrespective of signing or not signing the CTBT.
Nothing in the treaty imposes unilateral obligations on a state
that has signed the treaty," he said at a seminar on the
implications of CTBT at the Institute of Policy Studies here.
</P>
<P>
Nuclear deterrence is indispensable for the defense and
security of Pakistan and the government is determined to maintain
a robust and credible deterrent capability, the foreign minister
said.
</P>
<P>
However, Chief Executive General Pervaiz Musharraf has
reaffirmed Pakistan's commitment to restraint and responsibility,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Sattar said, "The government is in no hurry to make a decision,
let alone sign the treaty."
</P>
<P>
"The final decision will not be made unless an informed
consensus emerges as to what will best serve the interest of our
country," he said.
</P>
<P>
With the explosion of six nuclear devices in May 1998, Pakistan
is one of the seven nuclear nations in the world.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid Tuesday installed Lt. Gen. K.P.H. Rusdihardjo as the new
chief of the Indonesian Police, replacing Gen. Roesmanhadi.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion, Wahid directed the Indonesian Police
to focus on overseeing security and order by resorting more to the
function of investigation and petering out the function of
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
The president said a dichotomy of investigation and
intelligence is necessary to differentiate the functions of the
police from those of the Indonesian Defense Force.
</P>
<P>
Following the president's address, Vice President Megawati
Soekarnoputri presided over the ceremony to install the new police
chief.
</P>
<P>
Rusdihardjo, born in 1945, was appointed police chief of the
United Nations force for Cambodia in 1992. Before his new
appointment, Rusdihardjo served as head of the Police Staff and
Command College in Bandung, West Java province.

<HEADLINE> China to Boost Domestic Demand This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government will take
further measures to expand domestic demand this year in order to
maintain a healthy economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Minister Zeng Peiyan of the State Development Planning
Commission pledged a series of policies aimed at stimulating
domestic demand at a press conference held here today.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the government's policies to expand domestic
demand have proved effective over the past two years, and such
efforts will continue to further boost internal spending and
relieve stagnant deflation.
</P>
<P>
He said China will do away with all policies unfavorable to
private business and investment in the areas of taxation, land use,
and foreign trade, and that private businesses will be able to
enjoy opportunities on an equal-footing with state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He said that private investment will be allowed to enter all
industries, except sectors concerning state security and those in
which that the state must hold the market.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that China will maintain at least a 7.1
percent GNP growth rate this year, and that the country has
sufficient foreign exchange reserves and more than 30 billion US
dollars in foreign trade surplus, so there is no reason to devalue
the yuan in the near future.
</P>
<P>
He attributed last year's economic growth to the country's
issuing of treasury bonds. Last year, China issued more than 200
billion yuan (24 billion US dollars) of treasury bonds which
contributed two percentage points to the GDP.
</P>
<P>
Zeng made a comprehensive analysis of the outcome of last year'
s macroeconomic policy and remaining problems, and put forth the
main goals and tasks for economic and social development this year.
</P>
<P>
He said concrete steps will be taken to develop western China
this year, including additional preferential policies to help
western China attract foreign investment and additional funds for
projects in the underdeveloped western region of the country.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Central Bank may be Recapitalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian central bank (
Bank Indonesia) might be recapitalized if the bank is found
suffering negative equity position, a top official said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The government may recapitalize Bank Indonesia, if an
investigative audit expected to be conducted by the National
Financial Auditor (BPK) in the near future proves a negative
equity position of the bank," Finance Minister Bambang Sudibyo
told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
He said that the recapitalization of the central bank would be
financed by government bonds.
</P>
<P>
"And it is possible that the bonds will be offered to foreign
investors, because maximum capacity of domestic investors would
only be able to absorb an amount of 20 trillion rupiah (2.8
billion U.S. dollars), whereas the need for recapitalization of
the central bank is predicted to reach hundreds of trillion rupiah,
" the minister said.
</P>
<P>
But, Sudibyo refused to predict how much money would be needed
by the government to recapitalize the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Previously, IMF senior resident representative in Indonesia
John Dodsworth said that the exact amount (of the central bank
recapitalization fund) would be discussed by the Indonesian
government and IMF.
</P>
<P>
BPK had conducted an efficiency audit to the central bank, and
it had submitted on Friday the audit result to the House of
Representatives (DPR).
</P>
<P>
BPK is also expected to soon conduct an investigative audit
into the central bank to detect irregularities in the bank.
</P>
<P>
"It is expected that an investigative audit would be completed
by BPK by March 31, 2000. Then we will know the real condition of
Bank Indonesia and we will know how much money would be needed to
recapitalize Bank Indonesia," Sudibyo added.
</P>
<P>
However Sudibyo said that the government has no intention to
break the bank institution, adding the investigation is intended
to determine who are the wrongdoers.
</P>
<P>
"We will save Bank Indonesia and we will defend the central
bank's position and its credibility, but the wrongdoers in Bank
Indonesia should be brought to justice if they are found guilty.
This will be an evidence that the new government is consistent and
serious in curbing corruption," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia now has been facing a tough criticism from the
public as the bank failed to recollect its liquidity assistance (
BLBI) mounting to 164.54 trillion rupiah (23.4 billion U.S.
dollars) which had been disbursed to the country's troubled banks.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Sets Five-Year Trade Development Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Trade Development Board (
TDB) of Singapore Tuesday announced a series of targets it has set
for Singapore's trade development in the next five years as well
as major objectives and strategies it has adopted to focus on
expanding the country's global market share and securing global
market access.
</P>
<P>
The document, entitled "Trade 21" and released by TDB at a
press conference Tuesday, shows that Singapore's merchandise trade
is set to grow four to six percent per annum to hit 500 billion
Singapore dollars (about 303 billion U.S. dollars) by 2005, off-
shore trade to expand by three to five percent annually to reach
220 billion Singapore dollars (about 133 billion U.S. dollars) and
service export to pick up five percent per annum to 43 billion
Singapore dollars (26 billion U.S. dollars) during the period.
</P>
<P>
Recognizing that international market development will itself
become a more knowledge-intense and IT-driven activity, TDB says
it will seek new markets and distribution channels for the
emerging knowledge-based products and services of Singapore
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
TDB asserts that internationalization of Singapore enterprises
and development of Singapore as the global center for trade hub
services constitutes its two major thrusts in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
TDB aims to get local enterprises to leverage on the Internet
and other IT-related tools so as expand their trade and overseas
commercial presence, especially in emerging and non-traditional
markets, through implementing a co-ordinated program to
internationalize Singapore enterprises-- the ISE Program.
</P>
<P>
Under the ISE, trade of local enterprises is targeted to grow
by 6-8 percent per annum to reach 175 billion Singapore dollars (
about 106 billion U.S. dollars) by 2005 and the proportion of
indigenous overseas direct investments to GNP is fixed to reach 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
TDB seeks to attract and anchor in Singapore global players in
international trading, transport and logistics and exhibition
services through its global trade hub services program, which is
aimed at replicating in cyberspace the gateway function that
Singapore already serves for international trade,.
</P>
<P>
TDB plans to help these sectors to grow by four to six percent
per annum and raise the contribution rate to GDP by trade hub
services to 14 percent by 2005 from 13 percent in 1998 and
increase the value-added to 28 billion Singapore dollars (17
billion U.S. dollars) from about 20 billion Singapore dollars (12
billion U.S. dollars) at present.
</P>
<P>
Also in the document, TDB declares it will work with like-
minded countries to push for a new round of world trade talks so
as to enable Singapore to seek greater market access and reduction
/elimination of industrial tariffs as well as clear international
rules to facilitate the growth of e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
TDB also states that its country will pursue market access with
key trading partners through regional and bilateral free trade
agreements and seek eventual expansion of the Free Trade Areas (
FTAs) to include ASEAN.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 4 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's mines are
preparing to return to full operations after a completely smooth
transition to 2000 with no problems encountered, South African
Press Association reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"It was a case of no hitches and no glitches," said J.J. van
Coller, manager of Harmony Gold Mining Co Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Van Coller added that underground shifts were scheduled to
resume this evening.
</P>
<P>
He said that the group's computers were on but there was no
access to the Internet and technicians were still monitoring the
situation for potential computer viruses.
</P>
<P>
"We will resume Internet connectivity by the end of the week,"
Van Coller said.
</P>
<P>
Anglo American plc (AA plc), the London based industrial and
mining giant, has been running a Y2K center from its headquarters
in London and all units have been reporting to the center daily
over the holiday period.
</P>
<P>
James Duncan, a spokesperson for Anglogold, the world's biggest
gold producer, said "one or two mines" were scheduled to commence
operations this evening and the remainder would resume at the
first shift tomorrow morning.
</P>
<P>
Diamond producer De Beers said all its plants were operating
normally.
</P>
<P>
"In South Africa, we have tested all our plants and there was
not one problem," a spokesperson for the company said.
</P>
<P>
"In Botswana we are also up and operating normally."
</P>
<P>
The spokesperson ascribed the absence of any problems to
thorough planning and preparation.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Angolans Hug New Year for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Angolans are praying that the new
year of 2000 will open up broad prospects for the country's peace
process and economic development.
</P>
<P>
"We feel hopeful about the year 2000. We Angolans expect a
durable peace and a stable social-economic situation in the coming
century," said Joao dos Santos, a middle-ranking public servant
working for a governmental department.
</P>
<P>
During the past year, the southern African country has
witnessed recrudesced civil war, grave humanitarian crisis,
collapsed economy and spreading epidemic diseases. A large number
of persons were displaced and driven to desperation.
</P>
<P>
However, with the progress made by the Armed Forces of Angola
(FAA) in the central highland and south border areas traditionally
controlled by the rebels led by Jonas Savimbi, most Angolans
believe that peace is approaching and the economic construction
will be soon restarted.
</P>
<P>
According to Angolan Planning Minister Ana Dias Lourenco, her
ministry will in the year 2000 give top priority to the
implementation of the program on the national reconstruction
aiming to rehabilitate the economy.
</P>
<P>
She said that in the new year, Angola will benefit from its
relative macro-economic stability in 1999 and focus on improving
the living conditions of the population.
</P>
<P>
"Angola has all elements for further economic development but a
peaceful atmosphere," she said, adding that Angola, the second
largest oil-producing country in Africa, is rich in diverse
natural resources such as diamond reserve, wood, petroleum and
natural gas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Angolan Minister of Hotel and Tourism Jorge Valentim
 considered that Angola, a country with abundant scenic spots,
should have attracted a lot of tourists.
</P>
<P>
"Angola is very beautiful. I'd like to see a lot of tourists on
the streets of Luanda from all around the world," said Jose Pinto,
a vagabond child begging for food all day long.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan capital city Luanda, built in a cozy bay of the
Atlantic Ocean decorated with tall and upright palm trees, was
considered in 1970s as one of the most beautiful capitals of the
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The magnificent view of the Angolan central plateau, dotted
here and there with the gigantic monkey bread trees, had also
attracted many foreign visitors.
</P>
<P>
In the new year, the Angolan government is determined to revive
all these. The country has begun to rehabilitate its industrial
and agricultural productions, with the new program called
Self-sufficient Agricultural Production, strongly promoted by the
central and provincial governments.
</P>
<P>
With the help of international organizations and local
governments, Angolan peasants have got seeds and agricultural
utensils to produce potato and corn, which will help the country
improve its traditional food regime of papaya and manioc.
</P>
<P>
As for foreign investment, Angola absorbed in 1999 some three
billion U. S. dollars from abroad, ranking the third among African
countries. It is expected that the country will attract 19 billion
U.S. dollars in the coming four to five years.
</P>
<P>
However, the war-torn country still has a long way to go in its
search for peace and development.
</P>
<P>
Although the government troops are closing in on the smashed
rebels hiding in forest areas, they have not yet captured the
crucial person, namely Jonas Savimbi, chairman of the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
The existence of Jonas Savimbi in UNITA will undoubtedly
constitute a grave threat to the country's peace process, analysts
here said.

<HEADLINE> Japan Declares Victory Over Y2K Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 4 (Xinhua) -- A senior Japanese government
official declared on Tuesday Japan's victory over the feared Y2K
computer bug, saying that there have been no reports of major
computer problems in the country's infrastructure or business.
</P>
<P>
"There have been no major problems regarding our social
infrastructure, including the fields of energy, transportation,
telecommunications and medicine," Chief Cabinet Secretary Mikio
Aoki told a press conference on the first working day of the new
year.
</P>
<P>
There had been no reports of major problems at financial
institutions, which began full operations Tuesday, the top
Japanese government spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Japan's financial markets, businesses and government offices,
which were closed Monday for the New Year's holiday, resumed
operations throughout the country Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Most small and medium-sized companies, which had been said to
lag behind in preparations for the Y2K problem, also opened for
the new year the same day.
</P>
<P>
Trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Tokyo foreign exchange
market, proceeded without any disruptions from the Y2K computer
bug, and the money market and the bond market also reported no
disturbances.
</P>
<P>
Financial institutions also started operating their automatic
teller machines Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Aoki said a government task force on the millennium bug will
cease operations Wednesday if there are no major problems reported.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Computers Survive Y2K Challenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian computers have
successfully rolled over to the new millennium without big Y2K
hitches, leading Nigerian newspaper The Guardian said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Many banks in Lagos, Nigeria's commercial capital, had since
Saturday morning confirmed their system's compliance and printed
out account statements of customers with year 2000 date.
</P>
<P>
At Zenith International Bank branch headquarters in Lagos'
Victoria Island Monday business was as usual with no complaints of
computer shutdown, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of Nigeria last week advised banks to overhaul
their systems and go manual around the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
The manager of the Inlaks Computers Limited, a local computer
company, said the company had not received any distress call from
its customers, despite the company kept constantly vigil during
the turn of the century and sent its experts to clients to check
up potential problems.
</P>
<P>
However, trading at the Lagos floor of the Nigerian Stock
Exchange (NSE) where the Y2K bug also didn't appear, dipped to an
all-time low as investors apparently fearing possible non-
compliance of the exchange's computers spent a paltry 17.19
million naira (about 781,300 U.S. dollars) on 3.99 million shares
in 262 deals.
</P>
<P>
Also in Abuja, Nigeria's capital, no bank suffered any
breakdown as operations continued without any disruption, laying
to rest the Y2K fever that gripped the federal capital last week.

<HEADLINE> Five Killed in Lagos on New Year Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Five people were killed in Lagos
in two separated killings during the New Year celebrations, said
The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Two policemen of the Lagos State Police Command were among the
victims, thus renewing widespread fears that efforts to stem urban
banditry in the metropolis were yet to yield results,
</P>
<P>
Two out of the five victims were killed at Ajegunle, a district
in Lagos, Nigeria's commercial capital. They were suspected to be
targets of assassination because the felons took no valuables. The
killings occurred between 1:15 a.m. (0:15 GMT) and 5:30 a.m. (4:30
GMT) on the New Year day.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear whether the two killings were connected to the
ethnic violence that plagued the Ajegunle suburb late last year.
But police identified the dead as an Ijaw and a Yoruba, two races
entangled in a clash last year which killed around 100 people.

<HEADLINE> China Invests Heavily to Upgrade Steel Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Many of China's largest steel
firms recently embarked on a program of technological renovation
with strong financial backing from the government.
</P>
<P>
China issued a 60-billion-yuan treasury bond last September, 9
billion of which was earmarked for technological renovation in the
country's large state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The steel industry, one of the nation's key sectors, has been
given priority in this effort, while 75 technological upgrading
projects have been approved by the State Economic and Trade
Commission, involving investment of more than 50 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Of this total investment, 27.9 billion yuan comes from bank
loans, with the rest coming from the Chinese government as part of
its supporting efforts.
</P>
<P>
The massive drive involves three steps.
</P>
<P>
First, four giant steel complexes, the Shanghai-based Baoshan
Iron and Steel, Anshan Iron and Steel, Beijing's Shoudu Iron and
Steel, and Wuhan Iron and Steel, are expected to be transformed
into modern steel enterprises capable of competing on the
international market.
</P>
<P>
Second, the industry's reliance on imports will be eased, and
the upgrading of steel variety and the development of value-added
products will be emphasized. Currently, China still needs to
import about five million tons of value-added steel products
annually.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Israel to Fund Lawmakers in Referendum Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 4 (Xinhua) -- A Israeli government committee
approved to provide state funding for individual members of the
Knesset (parliament) to campaign for or against a peace treaty with
Syria, Israel Radio reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 10-member Ministerial Law Committee endorsed the referendum
law by a vote of 7 to 2 at a Monday meeting, with Religious Affairs
Minister Yitzhak Cohen refusing to vote.
</P>
<P>
The initiative to finance individual lawmakers takes into
account the fact that some parties are divided on whether to seal a
peace treaty with Syria and to withdraw from the Golan Heights
Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Syrian peace talks, which resumed on December 15 after a
45-month break, entered the second round in the U.S. Monday, with
the Golan issue at core of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Any possible deal with Syria will be submitted to referendum to
decide. Recent opinion polls have shown the country's population
roughly split down the middle over a possible withdrawal from the
Golan.
</P>
<P>
The government proposal, which also favors a simple majority for
the approval of a deal with Syria in the referendum will be
presented to the whole cabinet and then to the Knesset law
Committee for consideration, along with a referendum bill submitted
by opposition Likud party several weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Likud on December 20 presented to the Knesset a bill, which
proposed that a peace deal with Syria must have the support of more
than 50 percent of Israel's eligible voters before it could be
ratified by the referendum. This means that the deal must be
approved by more than 60 percent of those who actually cast their
votes.
</P>
<P>
The bill, if passed, would undoubtedly make it more difficult
for Prime Minister Ehud Barak to win approval for a possible peace
accord with the Jewish state's arch-foe Syria.

</P>

will only compromise on 700 meters.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Gov't Urged to Handle Ambon Case  Seriously </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has to
handle seriously the ethnic bloodshed in Ambon, capital of
Indonesian Maluku province, a top legislator said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Indonesia has to solve the problem in Maluku
province soon. It should handle the case seriously," Chairman of
the Peoples Consultative Assembly (MPR) Amien Rais told a press
conference on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government has put a wrong policy in handling
ethnic bloodshed in the province.
</P>
<P>
"The president has said that Ambon case should be solved by
locals. I think this is wrong (policy). The prescription given by
President Abdurrahman Wahid (on Ambon settlement) is wrong. It is
just like a blank form, I think," Amien Rais said, adding such
policy even paved the way for the warring parties to intensify
their conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Urging the Indonesian Military (TNI) to take decisive measures
to quell ethnic bloodshed which has been lasting for nearly a year,
Amien Rais said that the military should also improve their
capability in intelligence operation.
</P>
<P>
"You know, Ambon is a small area but our intelligence can't
observe the area (to prevent further conflicts). It is a proof
that the capabilities of our intelligence deserve being questioned,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Maluku province has witnessed a year long ethnic bloodshed
between Christian and Moslem, which has claimed more than 1,300
civilians.
</P>
<P>
But unofficial sources said the figure might reach thousands
while tens of thousands have been seeking refuge.

BANGKOK, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Some 105 people were killed in

<P>
A large number of temporary workers in the Thai capital were

Many of the workers spent the four-day holiday at home, causing

<HEADLINE> Angola to Improve Logistic Support for Troops in Central Highland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Angola will improve the logistic
conditions for the Armed Forces of Angola (FAA) fighting in the
central highland, official source said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Chief of the General Staff of the Central Military Region
Luis Domingos was quoted by the official news agency Angop as
saying that in the first year of the new millennium, his troops
will get better logistic support from the rear bases.
</P>
<P>
According to Luis Domingos, head of the government troops
stationing in the central provinces of Huambo, Benguela, Bie and
Kwanza-sul, the government troops will concentrate their attention
on the organization of logistics so that the soldiers can overcome
the scarcity of food and other necessities of life.
</P>
<P>
Luis Domingos said that discipline, spirit of sacrifice and
dynamism are crucial for improving the logistic support. During
the over-25-year civil conflict, the government troops suffered a
lot from the poor logistic support since the rebels led by Jonas
Savimbi had the control over the rural areas and destroyed most
principal supporting lines for the government troops.
</P>
<P>
After a successful general offensive in the central highland,
the government troops expelled the rebels into the forest areas
and began repairing and reconstructing the destructed bridges and
roads.

AOL's commissioned Internet sales report by Internet Research
Group of Wayne, Pa., indicated that two-thirds of AOL 20 million

</P>
<P>
AOL said the average shopper using its service between
Thanksgiving and Christmas spent 300 dollars for online goods and
services over the holiday season, a 50 percent jump over 1998
spending. Ninety-five percent of polled members indicated that
they will likely shop online again during the next six months.
</P>
<P>
The top shopping categories were lingerie and kid's wear in the
apparel group, toys in the kid's group, mobile electronics in the
consumer electronics group, music and videos in the entertainment
group, and athletic shoes and apparel in the sports and outdoors
group.
</P>
<P>
Two more surveys, conducted by ABCNEWS.com and Yahoo! Inc.
separately, drew similar conclusion.
</P>
<P>
A new ABCNEWS.com survey, conducted by telephone December 28 -
January 2, found that 13 percent of Americans say they used the
Internet to buy holiday gifts this year, with their online
purchases averaging 314 dollars. It also found 44 percent adults
in the United States plan to buy online in the future.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Yahoo! Inc. said its shopping site's orders jumped
400 percent from those of last year from November 25 to December

<HEADLINE> Twenty-five Clinical Mad Cow Cases Reported in Switzerland in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- A total of 25 clinical cases of
Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), known as mad cow disease,
were discovered by December 24, 1999, compared to 14 cases in 1998,
according to the Swiss Federal Veterinary Office Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Another 24 cases of mad cow disease were reported last year in
tests conducted under a new surveillance program, the office said.
</P>
<P>
However, the office was quoted by Swiss Radio International as
saying that there is no cause for alarm despite the marked
increase.
</P>
<P>
"The long-term trend is quite clear. BSE in Switzerland is on
the decline," said Veterinary Office specialist Dagmar Heim.
</P>
<P>
Heim explained that the higher numbers last year could be due
to the new control program, more media coverage on the subject and
the possibility that some cases were not reported in earlier years.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the goal of eradicating the disease
by the year 2003 can be achieved.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, Swiss authorities banned the use of animal fodder.
This leads them to believe that cases of BSE in cows born in 1997
and after are now unlikely. Among the cases diagnosed, there were
no animals born after 1996 when tougher control was introduced,
said Swiss Radio International.

<P>
PARIS, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The teachers of a high school in
the province of Gard in France have staged a strike since the
beginning of the new year to protest the return of two girl
students who wear Islamic foulard in classes.
</P>
<P>
The teachers of the Colldge Leo Larguier of the city of La
Grand-Combe refused to resume classes on Tuesday to protect the
secular tradition of French schools, after the local school
authorities allowed two sisters to return to classes wearing
Islamic foulard, reported Agence France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
The teachers want to separate the two girls, Romina and Diana,
who were born of parents of French nationality, from other
students.
</P>
<P>
Their mother, who was separated from their father and recently
converted to Islam, refused to have her daughters put off foulard
in classes.
</P>
<P>
She also accused the school of violating the law on obligatory
education for children.
</P>
<P>
The teachers are supported by the parents of other students.

<HEADLINE> Online Survey Reveals Y2K Subtle Legacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 3 (Xinhua) -- American information
technology (IT) executives and consumers are realizing that Y2K's
legacy will likely be more subtle and far-reaching than just one
weekend when many people had their hearts in their mouths.
</P>
<P>
This is the conclusion of an online survey conducted by U.S.
trade magazine Information Week, which published the findings
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The survey of 1,750 individuals, including nearly 1,200 IT
professionals, indicates that nine in ten have not personally
experienced any Y2K-related computer glitches or service failures.
</P>
<P>
But one in four IT professionals acknowledged that their
organizations suffered some Y2K-related problems since the New
Year's Eve. While most of the glitches were termed "insignificant,
" 16 percent caused brief service interruptions and four percent
caused significant interruptions.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, most problems were resolved within an
hour. But one in four respondents said that their problems might
take more time to be fixed. Some Web sites reported problems with
their organizations' supply chain or extranet.
</P>
<P>
Despite the lack of problems, not all Y2K fixes are finished,
according to the survey. Nearly one in four sites say that they
have further Y2K remediation to do before the effort can be
considered complete. But most of the work will be quick, as 69
percent say they will be finished within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
In hindsight, almost one in four IT professionals say they
spent too much on their Y2K fixes. But three out of four say that
the amount devoted to Y2K remediation was just right.
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of surveyed IT professionals who encountered
problems say their organizations' Y2K experience was positive
because it helped them upgrade and modernize systems. Only four
percent call the Y2K experience negative.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 4 (Xinhua) -- General Secretary of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) and Chinese President Jiang Zemin
has instructed the Party's top publicity department to pay more
attention to ideological work and cultural and ethical progress.
</P>
<P>
"Ideological work and the promotion of cultural and ethical
progress is crucial to the overall situation for building a
socialist country with Chinese characteristics," he said in
written comments on a work report submitted by the CPC Central
Publicity Department.
</P>
<P>
"The more we deepen reform and develop the socialist market
economy, the more attention we should pay to these aspects," Jiang
said, adding that such remarks must be frequently repeated to the
entire Party, and especially to leading officials.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out in his "instructions" that the CPC Central
Committee is satisfied with the publicity and media work in 1999
for their coverage of the National Day Celebrations, the Macao
handover, and the media campaigns in three major political
struggles.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also praised the country's publicity and media work in
recent years for providing correct ideological guidance for the
people.
</P>
<P>
He said that Party leaders at all levels should effectively
step up efforts to accomplish good ideological work and promote
cultural and ethical progress along with fulfilling economic tasks.
</P>
<P>
Publicity and media work should further educate people about
Deng Xiaoping Theory and the fundamental principles of the Party,
and fight against superstition and heresies, as well as explore
new ways for doing the job better, Jiang said.

vital importance for the guidance of China's cross-century
publicity work.
</P>
<P>
He urged publicity departments at all levels to adhere to the "
three emphases" on education, namely, emphasis on theoretical
study, political awareness, and good conduct, hold high the great
banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory and firmly keep in line with the
CPC Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core to better serve

<HEADLINE> Turkey Hit by Heavy Snow, One Frozen to Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Heavy snow has blanketed most
parts of Turkey in first few days of the new millennium, with one
frozen to death, roads forced to close and victims in the quake-hit
regions calling for help.
</P>
<P>
The Anatolia News Agency reported on Tuesday that a Bangladeshi
refugee trying to enter Greece through Turko-Greek border was
frozen to death.
</P>
<P>
The northwestern Bolu province, where a 7.2-magnitude tremor
took place in mid-November last year, was unfortunately not spared
from the heavy snow.
</P>
<P>
People in the region, with many quake victims still living in
tents and prefabricated houses, were caught unprepared by the
freezing weather.
</P>
<P>
Food and health provision are in shortage. As part of its aid
efforts, the Turkish government has distributed more than 9,000
stoves in the region for heating.
</P>
<P>
Yalova, another northwestern city rocked by a 7.4-magnitude
quake on August 17 last year, is also suffering from cold weather.
Earthquake victims in the city, who are facing serious heating
problems, demanded stoves from the government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a total of 340 village roads were closed in the
eastern Black Sea region. Authorities have warned drivers to beware
of ice on the roads while intensive efforts are underway on the
Ankara-Istanbul highway to keep the road open.
</P>
<P>
Police recorded a number of traffic accidents in Istanbul, the
largest city of Turkey. Snow, rain and wind also caused
difficulties on Istanbul's sea traffic.
</P>
<P>
No accidents have yet been recorded in Ankara, the capital of
the country.
</P>
<P>
According to Turkish State Meteorology Institute, temperatures
will continue to drop and more snow is expected in the next few
days.

ANKARA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items

</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News:
</P>
<P>
-- In the wake of Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit's announcement
that the government had failed to make a final decision on the
country's nuclear plant program before the end of last year, the
national power company TEAS has appealed to the bidders for one-
month extensions in their original offers.
</P>
<P>
The Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Ukraine in 1986 has prompted
environmental groups in Turkey to wage an anti-nuclear campaign.
The move hampered Turkish government's determination to implement
the nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- The Turkish government increased electricity prices by 5
percent and natural gas by 8.4 percent. But citizens complained
that the government was taking advantage of the cold weather
throughout the country in the first few days of the new year.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom):
</P>
<P>
-- Expecting brighter tourism markets in Turkey following its
European Union candidacy, five big foreign travel and tourism
companies have decided to invest in the country. Among them, the
Italian Fiat company and German Dorint company proposed to open big
hotels jointly with Turkish companies.

<HEADLINE> Single Lightning Bolt Kills Six Zimbabweans in One Family </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 4 (Xinhua) -- A single lightning bolt killed
six members of one family in Harare, Zimbabwe's capital, for the
second time this rainy season which started in November last
year, the daily Herald reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The six members of a family died on New Year's day when they
were struck in their hut while sheltering from the rain.
</P>
<P>
The family members were sitting in a hut during a thunderstorm
when the bolt struck the hut, setting it ablaze.
</P>
<P>
Although neighbors tried to rescue them, their efforts were
futile as the flames were too strong. By the time they managed to
conquer the flames and break into the hut it was too late.
</P>
<P>
Police Spokesman Chief Superintendent Wayne Bvudzijena said on
Monday their deaths, once again, reminded Zimbabweans of the need
to take precautions against lightning.
</P>
<P>
He called on people living in the communal areas to install
lightning conductors whenever possible and to avoid standing
under trees in rain.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time this season that six people have been
struck dead by lightning.
</P>
<P>
The six brought to 67 the number of people reportedly killed by
 lightning so far this season.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has a high incidence of lightning, yet little
precaution is taken to protect both humans and livestock.

<HEADLINE> 35,000 Zimbabweans Deported From S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 4 (Xinhua) -- More than 35,000 Zimbabwean
border jumpers, the highest figure in a decade, were last year
deported from South Africa, the daily Herald newspaper reported on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The figure is almost twice that of 1998, said Chief Inspector
Thomas Masare, who is in charge of Beitbridge Police Station in
south Zimbabwe, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said on average, some 2,976 jumpers were deported each
month, and the bulk of these were picked up in Johannesburg of
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The deported border jumpers left the country to illegally
settle in South Africa, where they were employed as cheap labor.
</P>
<P>
Most of them worked on farms as laborers, while some filtered
into the large urban settlements, where they looked for jobs in
industries and shops.

<HEADLINE> Higher Growth Rate Predicted for China's Exports (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 4 (Xinhua) -- China's export volume for the
year 2000 is expected to surpass 210 billion U.S. dollars, higher
than the estimated six percent for 1999, according to foreign
trade experts.
</P>
<P>
Li Jian, a research fellow with the Chinese Academy of
International Trade and Economic Cooperation, said in an interview
with Xinhua that China's foreign trade will continue to grow
steadily in the new year.
</P>
<P>
Total foreign trade volume this year is expected to reach the
400-billion-U.S.-dollar target set in the country's ninth five-
year plan for the 1996-2000 period, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li based his prediction on both domestic and international
factors.
</P>
<P>
Although hit by the Asian financial crisis and severe flooding
over the past two years, China has maintained a gross domestic
product (GDP) growth rate of over seven percent, and some
economists estimate that the GDP will grow at around 7.5 percent
this year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China's exports recovered in the latter half of
last year, and the final figure for the whole of 1999 is expected
to show a growth rate of around six percent to hit 195 billion U.S.
dollars in 1999, according to Li.

<TEXT>
<P>
In the new year, Li said, China will continue to have a
favorable international environment characterized by improvements
in global economic performance, a relatively stable world
financial market, increased world trade, recovery in commodity
prices on the international market, and rapid flow of
transnational capital that might set new record.
</P>
<P>
In particular, he said, China's major trading partners,
especially those in Asia, have increased their imports, creating
more opportunities for China's exports.
</P>
<P>
These economies have also seen rising exchange rates and
growing economic indices, which means they might need more Chinese
products, said Wang Songqi, a senior research fellow with the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that as China continues to employ an active
financial policy, greater investment will be earmarked for
infrastructure facilities, which in turn will help increase
imports.
</P>
<P>
China's imports have been growing at a double-digit rate over
the past two decades, and the rate for 1999 is estimated to grow
by some 18 percent to 165 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, experts also warned that China may also face more
challenges and competition, especially from the countries and
regions in southeast Asia, and as a result, overseas investment
could continue to drop. To deal with these eventualities, they
have urged government departments to help improve the
competitiveness of Chinese export commodities.

<HEADLINE> UAE Disbands Special Air Center After Millennium Changeover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
has disbanded a special aviation control center set up to ensure
aviation safety in the millennium changeover.
</P>
<P>
The center was withdrew after officials said months of
preparations had resulted in an incident-free New Year night.
</P>
<P>
The night was quiet and no air incidents happened in the UAE,
said a relaxed Riis Johansen, director of air navigation services
of the General Civil Aviation Authority, the Gulf News daily
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the National Air Traffic Management
Center was set up as part of the UAE's contingency plan to deal
with the Y2K computer problem, or the "millennium bug."
</P>
<P>
It was feared that some old computer systems might malfunction

<HEADLINE> Tehran Pollution to Decrease With Comprehensive Plan:  Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Air pollution in the Iranian
capital city of Tehran will decrease by 16 percent with the
implementation of a comprehensive action plan, a senior Iranian
official has said.
</P>
<P>
Vice President and Head of the Environmental Protection
Organization Masoumeh Ebtekar said that the anti-pollution plan
adopted Sunday, to be implemented over a period of 10-15 years,
would solve the air pollution problem systematically, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian cabinet has approved the details of the action plan
and decided to allocate a budget of 2 billion U.S. dollars for the
plan, she said.
</P>
<P>
Tehran Mayor Morteza Alviri announced last month that the city
would launch a 15-year project to combat the serious air pollution,
a combination of three plans worked out by the World Bank, Japanese
experts and Iranian environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
Air pollution in the Iranian capital city exceeded dangerous
level in the past weeks due to air stagnation, forcing schools to
close down three times and people to wear masks.
</P>
<P>
Over 2 million old vehicles with higher-than-standard fuel
consumption and exhaust gas emission are the main causes of air
pollution in Tehran, experts said.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Foreign Currency Reserves Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Israel's foreign currency
reserves reached 22.5 billion U.S. dollars in December, up 1.024
billion dollars as compared to the November figure, the Bank of
Israel said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The increase was accredited to the receipt of 960 million
dollars in annual civilian aid from the United States and a rise in
commercial banks' deposits in the Bank of Israel, the central bank
said.
</P>
<P>
The currency reserves hit an all-time high of 22.674 billion
dollars in December 1998, but then gradually declined.
</P>
<P>
The central bank also reported that the volume of foreign
currency trade in December continued to rise, totalling 17.76
billion dollars, compared to 16.96 billion dollars in November and
12.79 billion dollars in October.
</P>
<P>
Daily transaction volume averaged 807 million dollars in
December, up from 771 million dollars in November and 609 million
dollars in October, the central bank added.

<HEADLINE> Manila Eyes Foreign Visitors Grow by 20 Pct in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
targeting to increase foreign visitor arrivals by 20 percent and
domestic travel by 15 percent this year than 1999, a ranking
tourism official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Robert Antonio, undersecretary of the Department of Tourism (
DOT), said in a report that the DOT has identified 18 existing and
emerging markets under the country's tourism marketing plan for
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"The goal of our plan is to hit 2.2 million visitor arrivals
this year. The ultimate objective is to reach 4.7 million arrivals
by year 2004, provided we have at least 10 million inbound airline
seats," Antonio said.
</P>
<P>
The country's tourism industry suffered a major setback in 1998
due to the financial crisis, the temporary closure of the country'
s flag carrier and the DOT's lack of promotional budget.
</P>
<P>
"We will launch an aggressive marketing strategy this year to
expand our markets, The name of the game in tourism at present is
competition," Antonio stressed.
</P>
<P>
Antonio said the Tourism Marketing Plan 2000 has pinpointed the
United States, Canada, Japan, Chinese Taipei, China, Hong Kong,
Korea, Australia, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, United Kingdom,
Germany, France, Scandinavia and the middle East as the target
markets.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the plan identified Latin America and Russia as
emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
"We will saturate the target markets, particularly the
neighboring countries with information on new tourist products in
the country in order to tap the repeat visitor segment and reach
out to those who haven't visited the country yet," Antonio said.

<HEADLINE> Half of Tanzanian Children Deprived of Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Nearly half of Tanzanian
children aged between seven and 13 years are not in school and
have a slim hope of ever completing their basic education,
according to a report on the state of education in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian newspaper Tuesday quoted the report released
recently by the Center for Children's Rights as saying that more
than two million Tanzanian children, or 44 percent of all
school-aged children, are not enrolled in school.
</P>
<P>
Of the 56 percent enrolled, only 38 percent have the hope to
complete primary school and six percent to proceed to secondary
school.
</P>
<P>
After launching the Universal Primary Education (UPE) program,
Tanzania's gross enrollment ratio (GER) reached a peak of 98
percent in 1980, but declined to 71 percent eight years later.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, even if the age range was adjusted to
take late enrollment into account, only 64.5 percent of children
aged between nine and 15 years were enrolled in 1997.
</P>
<P>
From a national perspective, the report said, both girls and
boys are affected in roughly equal numbers.

<HEADLINE> Mbeki Urges West to Pay Attention to African Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 4 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Thabo Mbeki, in an interview with CNN on Monday, accused the West
of failing to do enough to tackle Africa's economic and political
problems.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said in his first television interview of the year that
he believed Africa's problems of debt, disease and war were being
largely ignored by the West.
</P>
<P>
"Not enough is being done about that. There needs to be taken a
decision really without equivocation," Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
He said the debt issue was closely related to many other
African problems, particularly the AIDS epidemic and poverty.
</P>
<P>
AIDS, which has infected 22 million Africans, is threatening to
wipe out a large portion of the African continent.
</P>
<P>
Rampant poverty in the continent is blamed for contributing to
the infections.
</P>
<P>
"Ways and means must be found to wipe out this debt as quickly
as possible," Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
African countries paid 31.5 billion U.S. dollars in debt
service, or some 25 percent of its exports, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki also urged the West to help Africa wipe out poverty. "You
can't disengage the poor countries from the richer countries and
you can't guarantee continued growth and expansion of the
economies of the developed world if you don't address the matter
of the further enrichment of these other billions of people who
have no access of what is being produced because they are poor,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
"It has to be part of this integrated response to the challenge
of poverty on the African continent. The major economies in the
world have to address this issue of the debt of African
countries," Mbeki said.

<HEADLINE> International Copper Prices Recover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Copper prices in the
international market have continued to recover since May 1999 from
1,467 U.S. dollars per ton in the second quarter to 1,680 U.S.
dollars per ton in the third quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's Financial Mail newspaper Tuesday quoted an Economy
Review by Standard and Chartered Bank as saying that the recovery
has much more to do with supply cutbacks than any sustained
recovery in demand.
</P>
<P>
But the Barclays Bank said the recovery in the international
copper prices is mainly a result of improvement in the Far Eastern
economies which have started recovering after the 1997/98
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Copper prices are expected to rise to 1,700 U.S. dollars per
ton this year and reach 1,800 U.S. dollars a ton next year.
</P>
<P>
By 2005, the prices will increase to 2,200 U.S. dollars a ton,
the weekly newspaper quoted the World Bank as saying.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Complete 18 Million U.S. Dollar Oil Tank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The construction of an
18-million-U.S. dollar oil tank in northern Zambia will be
completed by the end of this year, Times of Zambia newspaper
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The work on the fourth and final phase of the project is going
on smoothly, the local newspaper quoted Tahal Consulting
Engineerings construction manager David Hessel as saying in Ndola,
a northern city of the non-oil producing country.
</P>
<P>
The 40,000-cubic-meter tank, whose construction began in
February 1999, will be used to store crude oil for Indeni Refinery
in Ndola in case there is a technical problem along the Tazama
pipeline from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The tank has been designed with a floating roof which could
rise depending on the volume of the crude oil.
</P>
<P>
A water reservoir to store up to 1,500 cubic meters of water is
also under construction and will serve the fire fighting station
at the site.

<HEADLINE> California Police Find More Explosives Than Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 3 (Xinhua) -- California police have
recovered a large amount of dangerous explosives which are more
than they estimated and were stolen last week raising fears of
extremist attack over the new year holiday.
</P>
<P>
The Fresno County Sheriff's Department had found enough
explosives" to fill the bed of a pickup truck," including booby
traps, hand grenades, blasting caps, fuses and other detonating
material, Sheriff Richard Pierce said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We have five people in custody now," Sheriff's Dan Cervantes
said. "But the investigation is still on-going, and there may be
more arrests."
</P>
<P>
Originally, concerned officials estimated that about 200 pounds
of dynamite, gunpowder and the C4 military explosive were stolen
from a small concrete bunker in a rural area outside Fresno County,
about 240 kilometers east of San Francisco. They said the just-
found explosives were more than they estimated.
</P>
<P>
Cervantes said all the suspects were in their late teens and
had no apparent links to any anti-government or militia group.
Each of the arrested was charged with burglary and possession of a
destructive device, and ordered held on a 110,000-U.S.-dollar bond.
</P>
<P>
The heist had raised concern that Fresno could be a target for
some sort of millennium attack by anti-government extremist groups
and prompted the authorities to revamp security plans for
millennium celebrations.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Critics Name Spielberg "Top Movie-maker In 1990s" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Steven Spielberg was named
Monday by Broadcast Film Critics Association (BFCA) as the 1990s'
top movie-maker and his two films, "Schindler's List" and "Saving
Private Ryan," were put at the top of the list of the decade's
best movies.
</P>
<P>
BFCA described "Schindler's List," Spielberg's 1993 saga about
one German's efforts to save Jews during the Holocaust, as the
best movie of the decade, while "Saving Private Ryan," last year's
critically acclaimed film about a U.S. Army unit's search for a
missing soldier just after D-Day, was called the second best.
</P>
<P>
"With all the hoopla surrounding the end of the century and the
millennium, we didn't want the decade to be overlooked," said Joey
Berlin, president of BFCA, the nation's largest film critics'
group.
</P>
<P>
Two actors, Tom Hanks and Morgan Freeman, each had two of their
films in the top 10 of the 1990s, putting them in a tie for the
leading actor of the decade.
</P>
<P>
Hanks starred in "Saving Private Ryan" and "Forrest Gump,"
while Freeman had leading roles in 1994's prison drama "The
Shawshank Redemption" and in the 1992's "Unforgiven."
</P>
<P>
With three films in the top 10, 1994 was dubbed by BFCA
historian Joe Leydon "the decade's vintage year for movie-making."
"Forrest Gump," "The Shawshank edemption" and "Pulp Fiction" all
came out in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Idonesian Athletics Zeros in on Sprint, Hurdles, Walking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Amateur Athletics
Association (PASI) said that the organization would likely focus
its attention on sprint, hurdles and walking events to boost local
athletes' performance in the future.
</P>
<P>
"I think we can develop our athletes form in these events but
we will have to study the training methods and coaching seriously.
We will also work together with the medical commission to seek
young talent with an ideal anatomy for the three events," the
newly elected PASI chief Mohammad "Bob" Hasan said.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad was responding to critics calling the track and field
athletes in poor form in the Southeast Asian (SEA) Games in Brunei
Darussalam last year, as they won five golds.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad said PASI would stage a shortened schedule of regular
track and field competitions from four days with 46 events to two
days with 12 events, following a similar move by the European
Grand Prix series.
</P>
<P>
"We have started staging running events in some provincial
chapters and motivating them to keep doing it by providing
scholarships as an initiative for finalists," he was quoted by the
Jakarta Post Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
An official in charge of the sprint and hurdles commission
Bambang Wahjudi said that PASI would have to consolidate potential
athletes in chapters, clubs and student training centers all over
the country in both events.
</P>
<P>
"We have three top sprinters with Irene Truitje Joseph on the
women's side and Yanis Raubaba and John Murray on the men's.
Hopefully, our athletes in chapters, clubs and centers can follow
their steps through the national competitions," he said.

<HEADLINE> Youngest African Girl Reaches Africa's Highest Peak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 4 (Xinhua) -- A ten-year-old Johannesburg
girl is believed to have become the youngest female to reach the
summit of Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest point, the Citizen
newspaper reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kate Hamilton decided to conquer the 5,895-meter Uhuru Peak
after her parents, Mike and Elma, clibmed Kilimanjaro in northern
Tanzania two years ago.
</P>
<P>
"When we got back, Kate said she wanted to climb the mountain
and Elma and I said 'not a damn'," said Kate's father who
eventually accompanied her on the climb.
</P>
<P>
"But although there is an informal age restriction of no under-
16s on the mountain, two American boys aged nine climbed to the
summit a while ago, and Kate kept up the pressure on us."
</P>
<P>
Kate said: "I always wanted to break some sort of world record.
The youngest girl to have climbed Kilimanjaro was 11, so I wanted
to do it before my 11th birthday, which is on January 5."
</P>
<P>
She trained by walking an average of 40km a day.
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't prepare her for the altitude and the weather, but I
could make sure she was fit," said Mike.
</P>
<P>
Once on "Kili" she found the first couple of days easy. "But
later on it got very hard to breathe," Kate said.
</P>
<P>
On their final ascent, the barent and icy conditions took their
toll on the girl ad she developed frostbite.
</P>
<P>
When she reached the top Kate's father said he felt a mixture
of pride that she had made it and the shame that he had pushed her
so hard. He said he had sent an e-mail to the Guinness Book of
Records but Kate's record had not yet been independently verified.
</P>
<P>
The girl's next challenge is to climb Africa's second highest
mountain, 5,195-meter Mount Kenya.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 4 (Xinhua) -- China will soon start choosing
the winners of the 5-million-yuan (600,000 U.S. dollars) State
Supreme Science and Technology Award, the so-called Chinese Nobel
Prize, and the results will be announced by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Lin Quan, spokesman of the Ministry of Science and Technology,
announced here today at a press conference that his ministry has
adopted detailed regulations for launching state science and
technology awards.
</P>
<P>
He said the selection of the State Natural Science Award, the
State Technological Innovation Award, the State Science and
Technology Advancement Award, and the International Scientific and
Technological Cooperation Award will also start simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
The newly adopted regulation stipulates that Chinese citizens,

outstanding discoveries capable of securing intellectual property
rights.
</P>
<P>
To further Sino-foreign high-level scientific and technological
cooperation, the government has raised the number of international
scientific and technological cooperation award winners from three
or four each year to no more than 10 a year.
</P>
<P>
Lin Quan said that reform of the science award system will
focus on innovation, economic profits, social impact, and the
upgrading of industries.
</P>
<P>
The first-prize winners of the natural science, innovation, and
science and technology advancement awards can all receive as much
as 90,000 yuan (10,800 dollars).
</P>
<P>
He said these science awards at the ministry-level have been
reduced from the previous 68 to three this year.

<P>
WELLINGTON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand got off lightly
for earthquakes in 1999.

Christchurch when it struck west of Taupo at a depth of 340 km. A
quake of identical strength was felt from Auckland to Christchurch
when it hit Taupo at a depth of 164 km on October 26.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand had no shallow magnitude 6-plus earthquake, less
than 30 km below the earth's surface, since 1995.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1990s there were two or three a year, including
one in Fiordland in 1993 (6.6), on in Authur's Pass in 1994 (6.7)
and one 100 km off East Cape in 1995 (7.0).
</P>
<P>
The damage report for New Zealand in 1999 was modest. The year
1999 was a quiet year for New Zealand.

<HEADLINE> Record Funds Raised Through Depositary Receipt Offerings in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Companies and governments
from 33 countries raised a record 22 billion U.S. dollars through
113 depositary receipt offerings in the United States and European
markets in 1999, more than twice the amount raised in 1998, said a
report released Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report from the Bank of New York noted that Asian economies
raised over 11 billion dollars of the new capital, as recovery
took hold and restructuring accelerated. Privatization of state
enterprises continued as governments of 15 countries sold
depositary receipts totaling 6.7 billion dollars in the public and
private markets.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, depositary receipt trading volume on the New York
Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, U.S. over-the-
counter and European markets exceeded 22.8 billion shares, valued
at 758 billion dollars, up 21 percent over 1998.
</P>
<P>
The report said that technology and telecommunications raised
the most capital, totaling over 11 billion dollars. Cross-border
mergers and acquisitions using depositary receipts of more than
160 billion dollars, were a major theme.
</P>
<P>
The United Kingdom, Brazil and the Netherlands were the
countries with the greatest American depositary receipt (ADR)
trading volume in 1999, an excellent year for ADR investors as
many non-U.S. markets outperformed U.S. market, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Total global market capitalization of companies that have ADR
programs exceeds 6 trillion dollars at the close of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 10 years, global investing through the use of
depositary receipts has grown dramatically. The number of
sponsored depositary receipt programs has grown from 352,
representing 24 countries in 1990, to more than 1,800 programs
from 78 countries. Today 520 companies have listed their
depositary receipts on a national exchange, an increase of 195
percent from the 176 programs listed in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of New York, one of the largest banks in the United
States, expects continued growth of depositary receipts. It said
that the growth will be fueled by worldwide privatization, cross-
border merger activity, the acceleration of companies using
depositary receipts to access European investors, the growing
capital requirements of non-U.S. companies and economic recovery
in the emerging markets.

<HEADLINE> China Finishes Clean-Up of Freshwater Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, January 4 (Xinhua) -- China has finished the clean-up of
one of its major lakes, Chaohu Lake in Anhui Province, as all
industrial enterprises around the freshwater lake met state
pollutant discharge standards by December 30, 1999, one day ahead
of schedule as set by the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Of the leading 109 enterprises around the lake, each producing
more than 100 tons of waste water per day, 90 have reached state
emission standards and 18 have been shut down, moved, or changed
to other production. The remaining enterprise is now working hard
to reach the goal as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
In addition, of the 143 enterprises that produce fewer than 100
tons of waste water each, 125 have completed pollutant treatment,
and 17 have been closed or changed to other production. The one
remaining is now continuing efforts to comply.
</P>
<P>
As a result of this compliance, the water quality of Chaohu
Lake is expected to be greatly improved.
</P>
<P>
Clearing up Chaohu Lake, one of China's five largest freshwater
lakes, has been one of the nation's largest environmental
protection projects.
</P>
<P>
Chaohu Lake has been threatened by serious pollution and
dwindling wetlands for the past several years because of rapid
industrial development and advancing urbanization around it.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 280 million tons of industrial sewage and sewage
generated by nearby residents flows into the lake every year, and
the region around the lake, 13,000 square kilometers with a
population of 9.6 million, suffers from serious soil erosion.

<HEADLINE> Feature: New Year's Hope in Beijing Prisons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Fifty-five-year-old He Shirong
was the first man released from prison in Beijing on the second
day of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"Although I am older, I can still earn my own living," said He,
who looks very healthy after spending five years in jail for
bribery.
</P>
<P>
Wang Ming, 40, who was arrested for rape and robbery, bid
farewell to prison on Monday, two years short of the court-ordered
12-year term. He said he was such a sincere penitent that the
authorities decided to reduce his sentence, and now his future
looks bright.
</P>
<P>
To those who remain behind bars, the new millennium still
appears rosy.
</P>
<P>
These days, the prison look quite like a countryside club,
decorated with paper flowers and ribbons made by the prisoners and
the police -- except for the barbed wire netting.
</P>
<P>
Yang Di, warden of the Beijing prison, said that on the eve of
the new year, celebrations were held in more than a dozen jails in
the Chinese capital. "We saw the prisoners dance and sing into the
new year."
</P>
<P>
Some 30 prisoners spent the night with their wives and children
or their parents in special rooms similar to those of a hotel.
</P>
<P>
Yang, who has visited prisons in a number of Western countries,
said that China adopts a quite different concept from the West.
That is, China believes that criminals can be transformed into
good people, and they deserve their human rights including the
right to enjoy holidays.
</P>
<P>
Yang has been rewarded for this policy: as of January 3, 2000,
no uprisings, escapes and abnormal deaths had been reported in
Beijing prisons for three consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
And only two percent of the released prisoners were sent back
to jail for committing crimes, a percentage much lower than that
in Western countries.
</P>
<P>
Du Xiuchang, an official with the Beijing Prison Management
Bureau, said that exams were introduced to encourage the prisoners
to correct their behavior. If they perform well, they are able to
gain phone privileges or even have their sentences reduced.
</P>
<P>
"So, why not earn high marks?" he grinned.
</P>
<P>
In the Beijing Prison, every prisoner is asked to take care of
a potted flower and a live goldfish tank in his or her cell.
</P>
<P>
"It was in the cell where we came to understand the meaning of
life," said Wang Ming.

TOKYO, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices closed mixed in Tokyo
on Tuesday, the first trading day of the new year, with the key
Nikkei index ending above the 19,000 line for the first time in
more than 28 months.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose 68.52 points, or 0.36
percent, from last year's close to end at 19,002.86.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX) which covers
all First Section issues, however, dropped 4.73 points or 0.27
percent to 1,717.47.
</P>
<P>
After opening, the Nikkei rose rapidly and hit the day's high
of 19,187.61 before 9:10 a.m., but then faced profit-taking,
traders said.
</P>
<P>
As is customary on the first and last trading sessions of the
year, the Tokyo stock market was open only for the morning session
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section increased to 285.97 million
shares from 193.10 million last Thursday, the last trading day of
1999.
</P>
<P>
Hitachi was the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Export-oriented, high-tech issues were higher, boosted by the
overnight gain in the technology-heavy NASDAQ composite index in
New York, while steelmakers, banks and drugmakers were down.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, losers outnumbered
gainers 686 to 464, with 171 issues ending unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Athletics Remains Hopeful of More Olympic Slots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Having been assured of three
slots in the track and field competition at the upcoming Sydney
Olympics, the Indonesian Amateur Athletics Association (PASI)
still holds further hopes for another berth, the Indonesian
Observer reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Three slots were secured in the women's 200 meters through the
performance of Irene Yoseph, the men's middle-distance run (Yannis
Raubaba) and the men's 4x100 meters relay (Yannis Raubaba, John
Muray, Mahmud, Subakir).
</P>
<P>
The association is hoping that Supriati (women's 5000 meters),
Ruwiyati (women's marathon), John Murray (men's 200 meters) and
NunungJayadi (men's pole vault) will follow suit.
</P>
<P>
PASI General Secretary Tigor Tanjung said a number of
tournaments either at home and abroad would serve as the
qualifying arena ahead of the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The qualifying events include the Australian and Thailand Opens,
the Asian Cup in Jakarta and the National Sports Championship in
Surabaya, capital of East Java province.

<HEADLINE> America's Cup Sailing Postponed in Bad Weather </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AUCKLAND, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Racing in the America's Cup
challenge semi-finals was postponed here on Tuesday due to weather.
</P>
<P>
Race rules say sailing will not take place if the average wind
speed is more than 18 knots (33 kilometres per hour) for five
minutes.
</P>
<P>
Before the day was abandoned, Nippon Challenge, America True,
Stars and Stripes and France's Le defi had set up a deal among
themselves not to race.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that challengers have requested action
under a Louis Vuitton Cup race rule which permits postponement
upon agreement between the race committee and the boats.
</P>
<P>
Italy's Prada and AmericaOne, the two front runners, elected to
remain on the course until the day's postponement was announced.
</P>
<P>
Rain squalls blasted across the Hauraki Gulf with winds, over
30 knots (55 kph) at times, driving the seas into confused white
water.
</P>
<P>
Six syndicates from France, Italy, Japan and the United States
are competing for the Louis Vuitton Cup. The winner has the right
to challenge Team New Zealand for the America's Cup next month.

<HEADLINE> Iverson Paces 76ers to OT Win over Bucks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Allen Iverson scored one
third of his 45 points in the fourth quarter as the Philadelphia
76ers rallied for a 124-120 overtime home victory over the
Milwaukee Bucks on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Iverson was one point shy of his season high as the 76ers
improved to just 2-9 when he reaches the 40-point mark.
</P>
<P>
Iverson made 5-of-8 shots from the field in the fourth quarter,
when Philadelphia outscored the Bucks 32-26. He nearly won it in
regulation but his running jumper hit the back of the rim at the
buzzer.
</P>
<P>
Iverson set a career high with 38 shots, making 16, and was 11-
of-18 from the line. Philadelphia made 68 percent (28-of-41) of
its foul shots, while Milwaukee hit 84 percent (26-of-31).
</P>
<P>
Ray Allen and Glenn Robinson each scored 25 points to lead
Milwaukee, which has lost four of its last five road games.
</P>
<P>
In Boston, the debut of the Celtics' new floor was delayed 21
minutes by a power outage before Antoine Walker played his best
all-around game of the season in a 105-98 victory over the
slumping Cleveland Cavaliers.
</P>
<P>
Walker had 32 points, 13 rebounds and six assists and made a
huge block down the stretch. All five Celtics starters scored in
double figures.
</P>
<P>
In Chicago, Scottie Pippen did not have to take the court in
the fourth quarter as the Portland Trail Blazers cruised to an 88-
63 rout of the Bulls, who have lost a season-high 11 straight.
</P>
<P>
Pippen, the only active NBA player with six championship rings,
left the Bulls dynasty after winning his last title here in 1998
in a sign-and-trade deal with the Houston Rockets.
</P>
<P>
The Blazers pulled within two games of the league-leading
Lakers for the top spot in the Pacific Division with their fifth
straight win. Pippen had 11 points and six assists.
</P>
<P>
Rookie Elton Brand had 23 points and 10 rebounds for Chicago.
</P>
<P>
Grant Hill scored a season-high 42 points as the Detroit
Pistons snapped a 13-game losing streak in Orlando and an overall
seven-game skid against the Magic with a 118-106 win.
</P>
<P>
Hill was 17-of-30 from the floor, 5-of-7 at the line, grabbed
seven rebounds and handed out eight assists for Detroit, which has
won four in a row.
</P>
<P>
At Utah, Karl Malone scored 33 points and John Stockton handed
out a season-high 18 assists as the Jazz posted their seventh
straight home win against the Denver Nuggets, 109-89.
</P>
<P>
But it was rookie Quincy Lewis who hit a big 3-pointer at the
end of the third period and helped the Jazz pull away with seven
points during an 11-2 fourth-quarter spurt.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Mitch Richmond scored 19 points against his
former team and the Wizards pulled away late and handed the Golden
State Warriors their sixth straight loss, 99-87.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Develops 288M Direct Rambus Chip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 4 (Xinhua) -- South Korean Samsung Electronic
has developed a 288M direct Rambus memory semiconductor, which
will replace existing synchronous DRAM (dynamic random access
memory) chips as the main memory in high-speed PCs, workstations
and server computers.
</P>
<P>
Samsung's new chip is based on 0.17-micron design technology,
which can draw a pattern measuring one-600th of the width of a
human hair, realizing the highest integration rate for DRAM chip
design technology.
</P>
<P>
Based on technology developed by U.S. firm Rambus Inc., Rambus
DRAM features a higher speed and larger memory capacity using
fewer devices and has a wide application in mobile communication
appliances, digital electric gadgets and game players.
</P>
<P>
The company said on Tuesday that it will start mass production
of the next generation chip this month, with a monthly output of 2
million units.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Fails to Arrange Trilateral Mideast Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va, January 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton failed to arrange a trilateral meeting with Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara as
had been widely expected on Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
According to the schedule, Clinton would have had trilateral
talks with Barak and Shara in the evening after his separate
meetings with them earlier in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. officials could not convince the two negotiators
through almost nine hours of separate meetings.
</P>
<P>
"We do not expect any further meeting (this evening)," State
Department spokesman James Rubin told reporters after unsuccessful
U.S. mediation.
</P>
<P>
"From the way it unfolded, it would be not right for a
trilateral tonight, given the lateness of the hours," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the trilateral did not take place because the two
sides had been unable to agree on an "action plan" for the talks.
He said it was unclear if Clinton would return on Tuesday to the
negotiations in Shepherdstown, West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
He also declined to comment on the failure of the trilateral
meeting, saying "I wouldn't say that all is lost, or there has
been a breakthrough."

A senior official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was quoted
as saying on Monday that Bangladesh will take initiative soon
after Eid holidays to hold a meeting of the SAARC Council of
Ministers to carry forward the activities of this seven-nation
association.
</P>
<P>
The 11th summit of SAARC was postponed for indefinite period
due to India's reservations.
</P>
<P>
India had requested deferment of the summit because of "concern
and disquiet" over the recent military coup in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, bilateral relations between India and Pakistan have
been subjected to further strain following hijacking of an Indian
plane. India alleged that the hijackers got shelter in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"In such a situation, SAARC Secretariat is really in a problem.
They could not even prepare a budget for the current year while
adoption of new programs remains uncertain," the official said.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC's Charter allows any member country to request
postponement of a summit.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Develops New High Definition DVD Player </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 4 (Xinhua) -- South Korean LG Electronics has
developed a new digital versatile disc (DVD) player which features
picture quality more than four times clearer than existing models.
</P>
<P>
The device is based on a new technology called "blue laser
diode pick-up," which can replay high-definition-class video disks
with storage capacity of 18 GB, said the company Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Most DVD players, which have a maximum capacity of 4.7 GB,
can't fully support high-definition-class signals.
</P>
<P>
DVD, used to run games, movies and other software on computer
and TVs, is widely expected to replace VCRs and CD-ROMs because of
its superior picture and sound quality and excellent storage
capability.
</P>
<P>
With a data transmission speed of 24 Mbps, the player also can
be used to play digital signals. LG spent two years to develop the
technology.

<HEADLINE> S.Korean Scientists Discover Brain Cell Regenerator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 4 (Xinhua) -- South Korean scientists have
discovered a new substance that protects and regenerates brain
cells in rats, raising hopes of fighting degenerative brain
diseases, said a report in the latest issue of the "Journal of
Neurochemistry."
</P>
<P>
A research team at Seoul National University, led by Professor
Suh Yoo-hun, has found that a chemical called dehydroevodiamine (
DHED) extracted from natural herbs is efficient in deterring
memory loss and preventing cerebral apoplexy from destroying brain
cells during tests with rats.
</P>
<P>
Its test also showed that the material can restore normal
function to damaged brain nervous systems.
</P>
<P>
"The research is in its early stages of development. But with
this initial success, the prospects of curing a wide range of
brain diseases have brightened," Suh said.
</P>
<P>
Suh expects the material can be developed into a new medicine
to prevent and cure human brain diseases caused by the loss of
brain cells, such as Alzheimer's Disease, cerebral apoplexy and
dementia.
</P>
<P>
The scientists experimented with rats whose brain function was
damaged by cerebral apoplexy.
</P>
<P>
The rats' brain function markedly improved seven days after
introducing the substance.
</P>
<P>
The team has almost completed testing with animals on the
material's effectiveness and toxicity and plans to follow up with
pre-clinical experiments by the end of April this year.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka May Go for Parliamentary Polls in March:  Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga is likely to dissolve parliament this week and call
for parliamentary elections in March, press reports said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Island newspaper quoted political sources as saying that
elections will be fixed by the elections commissioner between
March 15 and 30.
</P>
<P>
The existing parliament can continue till August 16 this year
when its six-year term ends. But the president can dissolve
parliament earlier if she deems fit.
</P>
<P>
President Kumaratunga won the reelection in the fourth
presidential election on December 21, 1999 with a simple majority
of 51.12 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
Her victory has given the People's Alliance (PA) government
confidence that it could obtain a two-thirds majority at the
general elections, political sources said.
</P>
<P>
One of the main problems that the PA government has faced
during the past five-year rule was that it could not muster a two-
thirds majority in the parliament to introduce a political package
for the devolution of power to resolve the ethnic issue.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been troubled a seemingly unending ethnic war
since 1983 between majority Sinhalese-dominated government troops
and Tamil rebels who have been fighting for a separate homeland
for minority Tamils in the north and east of the island country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, despite early elections President Kumaratunga is
expected to reshuffle her cabinet and expand it to accommodate
those who supported her during the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The budget for this year, which was postponed because of the
presidential election, will be presented in April as the interim
budget passed last November was effective upto March.

<HEADLINE> More Troops Sent to Riot-Torn Maluku, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a press statement, the Indonesian Military (TNI)
headquarters said that, altogether, there have been 8,000
additional army troops deployed in North Maluku to support about 1,
000 personnel of the police and inorganic military troops in
maintaining the security in the riot-torn districts.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here Tuesday, the tense situation
in North Maluku has caused temporary closure of the Sultan
Baabulah airport in North Maluku's main city of Terminate on
Monday to anticipate possible impact of the spreading riots. The
airport will be available for military flights.
</P>
<P>
Fresh waves of clashes have erupted in North and Central Maluku
over the past week. The TNI estimated the death toll during the
week of violence at 448, with 270 others severely injured.
</P>
<P>
Up till Monday night, the security situation in North Maluku
was still tense following communal clashes which have spread in
North Maluku.
</P>
<P>
According to the Antara News Agency, fully-armed security
personnel comprising units of the police mobile brigade and the
TNI on Monday stood guard at various places in Ternate.
</P>
<P>
Groups of civilians also seemed to stand guard in many
locations, especially in housing complexes, with various weapons
in their hands, including machetes, spears, as well as self-made
bombs.
</P>
<P>
The provincial capital of Ambon was calm but tense on Monday as
soldiers, police and marines conducted the search. Troops backed
by armored personnel carriers stood guard.
</P>
<P>
"The military sweep will focus on Ambon first before we move to
other islands," Ambon Military Chief Lieutenant Colonel Arif
Mardiyanto was quoted by the Indonesian Observer as saying.
</P>
<P>
He added most of the confiscated weapons were homemade,
including daggers, pipe bombs, spears and bows and arrows.
</P>
<P>
Maluku has been the site of bloody communal violence since
January last year, and about 1,300 people have died since then.
Hundreds of shops, offices, homes and other buildings -- including
many churches and mosques -- have been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The province, comprising hundreds of islands in Eastern
Indonesia, was known as the Spice Islands during Dutch colonial
rule.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- A light airplane coming from the
United States violated Cuban air space early Saturday and dropped
thousands of "anti-Communist" pamphlets over Havana, Cuban
authorities said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish-language leaflet encourages Cubans to take to the
streets in a general strike and revolt against the Cuban
government, said the Cuban Workers' Central Office.
</P>
<P>
The plane was piloted by a Vietnamese-born American, who was
identified by a Miami Television station as Ly Tong.
</P>
<P>
Reports quoted the U.S. Customs Service as saying that the
single-engine Cessna 172 flew to Havana from south Florida.
</P>
<P>
Cuba launched two MiG fighter jets in response to the invasion
of its airspace by the small plane and the U.S. Air Force sent up
an F-16, and the Cessna and its pilot returned to Florida unharmed,
reports quoted Customs spokesman Michael Sheehan as saying.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Monday, the Cuban Government condemned
the invasion as the latest "counter-revolutionary" provocation,
tolerated by its "imperialist" neighbor and probably aided by
Cuban-American exiles in Florida.
</P>
<P>
The statement, entitled "Mad, drugged or mercenary?" referring
to the pilot, said that his "stupid counter-revolutionary
provocation" would merely reaffirmed Cubans' patriotic and
revolutionary sentiments.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that this new offense occurred when a solution
to the "brutal and rude kidnapping" of Cuban boy Elian Gonzalez
loomed large.
</P>
<P>
A U.S.-Cuba custody dispute over the six-year-old Cuban
shipwreck survivor has further tensed U.S.-Cuban relations.

The bureau said some 3.59 million foreign tourists visited
Indonesia from January to November last year, marking a 4.9
percent increase from the 3.42 million registered in the same

</P>
<P>
The number of foreign tourists visiting Indonesia is projected

<HEADLINE> Y2K Items Returned for Bug Free Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- As Monday passes without reports
of any major Y2K incidents, stores across Canada are facing
another millennium-related headache -- the return of Y2K items.
</P>
<P>
Local press said that most customers were understanding about
the no-take-back policy, but some were insisting on a reply to the
question of "What am I going to do with it now?"
</P>
<P>
"They're returning everything they bought -- propane, kerosene,
flashlights -- you name it," a Canadian Tire store in Halifax was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The hoarding could be traced back as early as 1998, when sales
of Y2K survival items doubled over the previous year, the press
report said.
</P>
<P>
Stores were responding differently with some giving full
refunds providing the items were unused and the customer had a
receipt and others assessing the deluge on a case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
"If a customer walks in with 100 liters of lamp oil, it's not
going to be as easy to return," a Fredericton Home Hardware store
manager said.
</P>
<P>
There were also retailers posting a non-returnable notice
months ago to warn customers that sales of Y2K-related items were
final.
</P>
<P>
Those stores had little sympathy with the returnees as they had
anticipated a returns frenzy at the earliest possible time.
</P>
<P>
With millions of computer systems returning to operation Monday
and Tuesday in Canada, the country is holding its breath again in
case of a major bug problem. The stores are just getting ready for
the problem of their own as they expect even more returns after
Monday's holiday, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Hi-tech Firm Expanding Business Scope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing-based Tsinghua
Tongfang Co., a hi-tech firm specializing in Internet services and
software products, is entering the competitive Digital Versatile
Disc (DVD) market, today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The move heralds Tongfang's entry into the production of
consumable electronic products in the coming years, said Zhang
Zhicheng, general manager of the company.
</P>
<P>
Previously, the company focused its business on investment-
orientated products, such as the development of disc and
application software.
</P>
<P>
Zhang's decision to enter the new field is based on advice from
the Tsinghua University, the founder of the company, and the State
Disc Engineering Research Center.
</P>
<P>
The disc center merged with Tongfang in 1997 and was
transferred into a subsidiary of the company, infusing fresh
capital to Tongfang's disc production.
</P>
<P>
Tongfang will use advanced DVD-related technologies developed
by the center while adjusting its production to the current global
trends. It plans to turn out 500,000 DVD players in 2000. Around
300,000 will appear in the domestic market beginning this month,
along with 500 new disk programs.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 200,000 will be sold overseas. The American Apeks
International Co. has ordered 150,000 from Tongfang for sale in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the company earned 1.6 billion yuan (192 million U.S.
dollars) from sales, swelling its total asset volume to 3 billion
yuan (361.4 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> State Investment Adds 2 Percent to Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Increased government investment
through issuing treasury bonds had resulted in adding more than
two percentage points to China's economic growth last year, a
senior government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
China saw an economic growth rate of 7.1 percent for the year
1999.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Peiyan, minister in charge of the State Development
Planning Commission, told a press conference held by the State
Council's Information Office this morning that the Chinese
government channeled 200 billion yuan (24 billion US dollars) to
investment projects by issuing additional treasury bonds in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government also issued additional 60 billion yuan
worth of treasury bonds on top of the scheduled issuance of 50-
billion-yuan T-bonds last year.
</P>
<P>
Zeng said that in combination with bank loans and investment of
local governments, the money from issuing T-bonds had helped
reverse the downward trend of investment in infrastructure and
technological upgrading.
</P>
<P>
This was the second consecutive year that China has adopted an
active fiscal policy to stimulate demand and economic growth. The
Chinese government issued 100 billion yuan worth of additional T-
bonds to fund infrastructure construction in 1998, boosting
economic growth by 1.5 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Calls for Impartiality of State TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
on Tuesday called on the state-run television (IRIB) to maintain
impartiality in its programs to ensure peaceful atmosphere for the
forthcoming parliamentary elections slated for February 18.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with the IRIB supervisory board, Khatami said that
the IRIB should keep aloof of the political cross-currents to
maintain national peace, especially on the eve of the parliamentary
elections.
</P>
<P>
He advised the IRIB supervisory board to impartially evaluate
the programs on the political, social, cultural and economic
developments, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian moderate factions have accused the IRIB, which is
under direct control of the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,
of siding with the powerful conservatives in elections since
Khatami was elected in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Some prominent reformists have warned the IRIB against any moves
to side with the conservatives in the forthcoming parliamentary
polling, which is believed to be sensitive in creating a new
balance of power in the country.
</P>
<P>
Khatami underlined that the television should promote mutual
trust between the government and the people, adding that the
destruction of that trust would eventually undermine the national
security.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the IRIB to respect public opinions.
</P>
<P>
According to the constitution, representatives of heads of the
government's three branches should supervise the IRIB, Khatami
said. He called on the supervisory board to fulfill the
constitutional provision in that respect.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Parliament Delays Debate on Press Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Majlis (parliament) on
Tuesday postponed for three months debate on a controversial bill
to revise the press law aiming at restricting press freedom.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 195 Majlis deputies present at the session, 111 voted
for the postponement while 84 others against, the Islamic Republic
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
This was viewed as a victory for the moderates who were opposed
to whittling press freedom.
</P>
<P>
In July the conservatives-dominated Majlis passed the general
outlines of the bill in a first reading, triggering strong protest
from university students which culminated in a political unrest.
</P>
<P>
Without permission, riot police stormed into Tehran University
dormitory in a massive crackdown. The move provoked a week-long
confrontation between students and police and forced Supreme Leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to step in.
</P>
<P>
Now the conservatives are pressing for the passing of the bill
before the February parliamentary elections, fearing that they
might lose majority if contested by the moderates who enjoy popular
support.
</P>
<P>
Since moderate President Mohammad Khatami came to power in 1997,
there has been growing loosening of control over the press. But
this was seen by the conservative camp as a threat to the Islamic
regime.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to quench the liberal tendency, the conservatives
exerts their powers. During the past two years, about six moderate
newspapers were order to shut down by the revolutionary and special
cleric courts and Abdollah Nouri, a famous reformist and managing
director of the banned daily Khordad, was sentenced to a five-year
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that bargaining on the bill would give the
moderates who support Khatami's reformist policies a chance to
revoke the bill, if they win a majority in the coming parliamentary
polling.

<HEADLINE> Researchers Link Enzyme Deficiency to Miscarriages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Doctors at the University of
Toronto have discovered that women having an enzyme deficiency are
more likely to miscarry, be infertile and suffer stillbirths.
</P>
<P>
The findings suggest that mothers carrying the deficient enzyme
pass it on during pregnancy, causing the foetus to die or develop
defects, the National Post newspaper of Canada reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The hereditary deficient enzyme is carried by more than 400
million people in the world, said the report.
</P>
<P>
"This kind of information is very helpful in trying to figure
out why there is so much pregnancy loss and why a lot of the eggs
that get fertilized don't end up to be healthy babies," Dr.
Barbara Hales at Montreal's McGill University was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that up to 75 percent of fertilized eggs do not
survive the gestation process, the report said, adding that in
Canada, more than 3 million people carry the deficient enzyme
known as G6PD (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase).
</P>
<P>
The new Canadian research result came after a three-year study
led by Dr. Peter Wells, with the faculty of pharmacy at the
University of Toronto.
</P>
<P>
In the study, researchers compared mice with varying degrees of
the enzyme deficiency to normal ones in pregnancy and found higher
rates of prenatal and postnatal death in the deficient group.

"Although U.N. Headquarters was closed for most personnel from

set up and running to deal with any Y2K-related problems," he said.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard told a press conference that "Everything went
exceptionally well, and work by the various personnel involved --
including security, information technology and management staff --
was well organized."
</P>
<P>
"By Monday, the Coordination Response Team received status
reports from U.N. field establishments in 127 countries, 14 U.N.

reported any significant Y2K-related disruptions."
</P>
<P>
"Similarly, there were no reportable disruptions at U.N.
Headquarters" in New York, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The efforts, which included mobilizing about 250 people over
the weekend, involved few costs beyond the cost of weekend labor,
and was all done within existing resources," he added.

<HEADLINE> Britain Greets Croatian Center-Left's Election Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Britain Tuesday congratulated
Croatia's main center-left opposition on its victory in the just
finished national election.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook telephoned Croatian Social
Democrat leader Ivica Racan, who will head the new government, a
Foreign Office spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Cook said that he hoped that the new government would be
building an open and democratic society and that Britain wanted to
help in their endeavors to achieve this change," said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Croatia held a national election Monday. With 99 percent of the
votes counted, the alliance uniting the reformed communist Social
Democratic Party and the Social Liberals won nine of the lower
house's 11 multi-member constituencies.
</P>
<P>
Croatian state television predicted that the result would give
the alliance some 70 seats in a 152-seat assembly. The alliance
had already said they would form a coalition government with a
bloc of four centrist parties which look set to take 24 seats.

<HEADLINE> Britain Enjoys Relief Over Y2K Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The London Stock Exchange, the last major international market
to reopen in the new century, came back on line at 0800 GMT and
reported no bug problems.
</P>
<P>
"I think we're all a lot more optimistic than we were on New
Year's Eve because there has been much less difficulty, "Margaret
Beckett, the minister responsible for tackling the bug said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have come through that far better than we dared of hope and
so I think we can be cautiously optimistic," she said.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet Office's central monitoring center in London was
quiet on Tuesday morning, with no major problems reported.
</P>
<P>
The positive indications echoed the experience of countries
across the globe, none of which has suffered to any great extent.
</P>
<P>
Britain spent billions of pounds on anti-millennium measures in
the run-up to the potentially-problematic date change. The money
seems to have been well spent.
</P>
<P>
The full effectiveness of Britain's multi-million pound battle
with the bug will be clearer in the weeks to come.
</P>
<P>
But Beckett urged people to take precautions as they returned
to work. She pointed out there were still problems to face, such
as the leap year transition at the end of February.
</P>
<P>
British government spent about 430 million pounds (about 690
million U.S.dollars) preparing for the bug while private industry
is thought to have spent up to 20 billion pounds (some 32 billion
U.S. dollars) in eradicating potential problems and putting
contingency plans in place.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, the Bank of England said that there had been a
few minor glitches reported by some financial institutions, but
most of the bug-busting measures had proved effective.
</P>
<P>
The Bank's deputy governor, David Clementi, said it was too
early to declare a complete success.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Robin Guenier, head of the independent bug watchdog
Taskforce 2000, said he remained concerned about databases and
billing systems which might not immediately be effected by the bug,
but which could encounter problems later.
</P>
<P>
"We have a long way to go, the whole of 2000 into 2001, the
potential possibilities, the possible knock on effects, the
possible consequences that are presently not known. It's really
far too early to breathe a sigh of relief and say it's all done,"
Guenier said

<HEADLINE> Clinton Begins Trilateral Meeting with Barak, Shara </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va., January 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton began a trilateral meeting Tuesday with Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Shara in
Shepherdstown, West Virginia, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said Clinton returned from Washington to first meet
with Barak. "There were some procedural issues to overcome and the
discussions are now moving forward," he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Clinton said he was going back to
Shepherdstown for the Syrian-Israeli peace talks and he was
hopeful despite of its rocky start Monday.
</P>
<P>
The scheduled trilateral meeting failed to take place Monday as
there were differences over which should come first for
negotiations. Syria insisted that an Israeli withdrawal from the
Golan Heights should be discussed first while Israel preferred the
security issue.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he was not disappointed that the trilateral
meeting failed to come off Monday. "That was partly my decision.
We just had a lot of other work to do.... I think they are both
very serious. Think they both want an agreement," he added.
</P>
<P>
"We just started, but all the issues are on the table, and it's
a pretty full table, as you might imagine. We're working at it,"
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton drove in a motorcade 65 miles (105 km) from Washington
to try to get the talks back on course.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart did not disclose anything about the trilateral meeting,
only saying that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was present
at the meeting and Clinton was likely to return to Washington
after the meeting.

<HEADLINE> New U.N. Arms Inspection Chief Expected to Be Named Next Week  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The New arms inspection
chief is expected to be named next week by the U.N. Secretary-
General, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General has a short list of candidates for the
position of Executive Chairman of the United Nations Monitoring,
Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC), the successor to
the United Nations Special Commission(UNSCOM) that verifies
disarmament in Iraq, Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
The deadline for the Secretary-General to appoint the Chairman,
in accordance with last month's Security Council resolution, is
January 16 and some action was expected to be taken by Friday,
January 14, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member Security Council adopted a new comprehensive
policy on Iraq by narrow margin on December 17, 1999, which would
establish a new arms regime called UNMOVIC to replace UNSCOM which
has not returned to Iraq since it withdrew from Iraq days before
the U.S.- led military air strikes against Iraq in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to the new policy, UNMOVIC will be in charge of Iraq'
s chemical, biological and ballistic-missile programme and the
International Atomic Energy Agency will be in charge of Iraq's
nuclear programme.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has to appoint an executive
chairman of the UNMOVIC, subject to Council approval within 30
days of adoption of the policy.

<HEADLINE> Namibia Safe for Tourists: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Namibia is generally safe
for visitors apart from the border areas where there has been some
military activities recently, a Namibian tourism official said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Dieter Galue, chairman of Namibia's Tour and Safari
Association, said the killing of three French nationals by gunmen
happened Monday in the northeastern Kavango/Caprivi border areas
where only about five to six percent of visitors head for.
</P>
<P>
The French nationals were killed when four cars were attacked
in two separate incidents by gunmen. Four other people were
wounded, including two foreign aid workers, according to the South
African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
Namibian military officials have blamed "bandits" of the
Angolan rebel movement UNITA for the attacks.
</P>
<P>
Glaue said tourists who head for the northeast usually are on
their way, via Botswana, to the Victoria Falls on the
Zimbabwe/Zambian border.
</P>
<P>
Some 8,000 to 9,000 (4.5 percent) of visitors to the arid
southwest African country are from France, the figure growing at
a rate of about 11 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
Some 200,000 to 250,000 foreign tourists visit Namibia's
deserts, game parks and coastal resorts every year, with the
numbers growing at about nine percent annually, he said.

<HEADLINE> Web Hosting Services Market Growing in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, January 4 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of
companies in the United States are turning to hosting service
providers to implement and manage their Web sites, and in response,
the Web hosting services market is growing at a torrid pace.
</P>
<P>
According to a report released Tuesday by the U.S. market
research firm International Data Corporation (IDC), this segment
is one of the fastest-growing markets in the U.S. information
technology (IT) industry and the Internet economy in general. The
firm expected revenues of U.S.-based Web hosting companies to grow
by almost 1 billion U.S. dollars in 1999 alone, bringing them to
over 1.8 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The robust U.S. economy is the leading factor driving growth in
the Web-hosting market, according to IDC. Even more remarkable is
the vigor of the IT industry and in particular the Internet, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
"The Internet economy now encompasses and affects far more than
just the IT industry that fostered it, and Web hosting forms a
core component of this economy because in many respects hosting is
its platform or foundation," said the report. "Without Web hosts
there would be no World Wide Web, which is now the leading
Internet service."
</P>
<P>
According to IDC, the U.S. Web hosting market will increase by
a factor of 10 through 2003, when it will total 18.9 billion
dollars. The United States provides the most lucrative market
opportunities for U.S.-based service providers, but IDC expects
international sales to generate a significant portion of revenue
by 2003.
</P>
<P>
As hosting service providers become more popular, IDC said,
other IT vendors and professional services firms have begun to
target them. The Internet datacenter is becoming a leading
environment for IT development and innovation.
</P>
<P>
In addition, IDC said, what constitutes Web-hosting service is
subject to change. Just a few years ago, Web hosting implied a
simple static Web site on a single dedicated or shared server. Now,
a single Web site may comprise dozens of clustered servers
operating as one or more domains and support several applications
or business process and often drawing on resources hosted in other
locations.

<HEADLINE> Romania Upgrades Roads With Foreign Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Romania's Transport Ministry
allotted most of the 1.5 billion U.S. dollars contracted with
foreign financial institutions to the upgrading of the national
roads, given the key significance of a country's transport
structures, Danila Bucsa, director of the National Road
Administration (AND), told the local daily Curentul Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The main target set for this year by the AND is to complete
upgrading of the country's only motorway -- the 113-km Bucharest-
Pitesti motorway and commission it by August, Bucsa said, adding
that the AND also plans to start the rehabilitation of the
motorway linking Bucharest and the Black Sea port of Constanta and
to continue the upgrading under way on other important national
highways, such as Brasov-Targu Mures (central Romania),
northwestern Cluj-Satu Mare, southern Bucharest-Alexandria and
Bucharest-Buzau. Part of the work is planned to be completed by
the end of this year, with the remaining by mid-2001.
</P>
<P>
The AND is monitoring, maintaining and repairing more than 15,
000 km of national highways, which carry some 75 percent of the
transport of goods and persons.
</P>
<P>
Bucsa underscored that all the targets set by the AND for 1999
have been met. The budget has covered satisfactorily the
maintenance operations and major rehabilitation work, with the
state budget making a minor contribution to such activities.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Experts Optimistic With Capital Market in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The players of the Romanian
capital market are optimistic as regards the trends of the two
stock exchanges in the year 2000 and consider there are premises
for the real growth of the investment in shares, sources active on
this market were quoted as saying Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the local daily Ziarul Financiar, a rise in the
number of financial titles and in the offer quality is expected
for this year, by the attraction of new issuing companies on the
capital market, following the finalization of the privatization
process in Romania.
</P>
<P>
President of the Romanian Stock Exchange Viorel Marian Pana is
of the opinion that the fiscal reform that starts in Romania in
the year 2000 and the start of the negotiations for accession to
the European Union are positive signs that can attract foreign
investors back to the stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
A diversification of the offer of transaction instruments is
also expected in the new year, with the finalization of a law
regarding the exchanges' operation. When the law comes into force,
the customers of the brokerage companies will be able to
participate in the transactions of futures contracts, governmental
bonds and other kinds of bonds.
</P>
<P>
The diminution in the tax on profit, initiated by the new
cabinet, and the drop in the interests to credits are considered
by the analysts of the market as the main prerequisites for a rise
in the stock exchange quotations. They estimate that this rise
will be higher than the inflation rate and the devaluation of the
Romanian leu currency, which will lead to a rise in real terms of
the stock exchange indices.

<HEADLINE> Nazi Suspect May Face Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The suspected Nazi war criminal ,
Konrad Kalejs, may yet face prosecution as Latvian authorities re-
open their investigations into claims that he committed mass
murder during World War II.
</P>
<P>
The British authorities have started deportation proceedings
against the 86-year-old Latvia-born Australian citizen, because
the police did not have enough evidence to arrest him.
</P>
<P>
But Scotland Yard was continuing its investigations into claims
that Kalejs took part in war crimes against mainly Jewish
civilians.
</P>
<P>
Kalejs was expected to leave Britain by Thursday of his own
free will, and return to Australia.
</P>
<P>
But the Latvian authorities have said this would not affect
their attempts to seek his extradition should fresh evidence be
revealed.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting with the Latvian ambassador in London,
Lord Janner, the head of the Holocaust Education Trust, detailed
the action being taken by the Latvian authorities.
</P>
<P>
He told the BBC they are "re-interviewing the witnesses, they
are looking at all the evidence again, and they are seeking new
evidence and if they get sufficient to warrant a prosecution they
will seek extradition."
</P>
<P>
Kalejs arrived in Britain six months ago after being deported
from Canada and the United States and has been staying at
Catthorpe Manor, Lutterworth, a retirement home run by the Latvian
Welfare Fund.

The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 359.58 or 3.1
percent at 10,997.93. The index fell 139.61 points Monday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's

composite index fell 229.46 or 5.5 percent at 3,901.69, the
biggest drop ever in history.
</P>
<P>
The market plummeted as fears for higher rates grew when the
Y2K problem was diminishing. The Federal Reserve left rates alone
because of the worries about the monetary system disruption by the
Y2K intrusion.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve raised rates three times last year in an
effort to ward off inflation. Analysts believed the Federal
Reserve officials will shift focus on rates from the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
The other reason for investors to sell shares was profit-taking.
Traders held onto stocks in the final days of 1999 to avoid paying
capital gains taxes and they would not pay taxes on the gains
until 2001 as they sold stocks in the new year.

Tuesday's sell-off was temporary and stocks will surge again
after the drop, analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Worldwide Chip Sales Hit Record in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGLES, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Worldwide chip revenue hit a
record high of 14.2 billion U.S. dollars in November 1999, up 24.8
percent over the same month in 1998, An American trade association
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
November's semiconductor sales were 6.2 percent higher than the
previous record of 13.4 billion dollars set in October, based on a
three-month moving average, said a sales report from the
Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA). In the first 11 months
of 1999, global chip sales grew 17.1 percent over the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
Sales in November illustrate the continuation of the industry
growth pattern that began in mid-1998, SIA said, and these numbers
show a healthy chip industry with across the board sector growth.
</P>
<P>
Memory product demand is particularly strong with flash memory
increasing 74.2 percent year to date in 1999, primarily driven by
wireless communications, according to SIA. Meanwhile, DRAM has
increased 47.6 percent, with PC and server demand being the major
drivers.
</P>
<P>
Growth was the strongest in the Asia-Pacific region and in
Japan, said the sales report. Chip revenues surged 39.3 percent,
to 3.67 billion dollars in the region in November, compared with
the corresponding month a year ago. Japan's semiconductor sales
jumped 38.6 percent to 3.18 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Chip sales in the Americas grew 16.4 percent in November, to 4.
3 billion dollars. European sales were also up 10.4 percent to 3.
07 billion dollars, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Brings Barak, Shara to Face-to-Face Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHEPHERDSTOWN, W. Va., January 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President
Bill Clinton brought Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouk al-Shara together Tuesday for a trilateral
meeting after procedural disputes were solved.
</P>
<P>
Clinton first met with Barak for a half hour before Shara
entered the meeting. The trilateral meeting had been scheduled for
Monday but it did not take place as the two sides differed over
which comes first in their peace negotiations. Syrian insisted on
putting an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights in the first
place while Israel preferred to discuss security.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said earlier Tuesday
that "the procedural hurdle" that emerged Monday had been overcome,
but he did not say how the two sides solved the dispute.
</P>
<P>
"We got a good start yesterday," Rubin said. "There was a
procedural hang-up in the evening. That hang-up has been overcome.
"
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart also said that the
procedural issues had been smoothed over and "the discussions are
now moving forward."
</P>
<P>
Rubin said committees had been formed to take up all key issues,
and that none would be overlooked by the two sides. He included
terms of the peace Syria is offering in return for the strategic
Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Clinton drove in an motorcade 65 miles (105 km) from Washington
to Shepherdstown for the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Before departure for the trilateral meeting, Clinton said that
it was "partly my decision" not to have the trilateral meeting
Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
He said it was just the beginning of negotiations and all
issues would be on the table, "and it's a pretty full table as you
might imagine. We're working at it."
</P>
<P>
"What we're looking at now up in West Virginia is sort of
figuring out what the process for the next few days is going to be,
" he said.

Shutters, awnings and trash littered the streets of Owensboro

</P>
<P>
Along with the largely unoccupied campus, local officials
estimated some 800 homes and businesses were damaged in the city.
</P>

Some 5,000 customers were without power and may remain so for

"Every road leading on or off the campus is blocked by downed
trees or power lines, so there is no getting in or out, " said

</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in nearby Crittenden County, a state of emergency
has been declared with as many as 100 homes damaged, and a tornado
was reported in Webster County as the storms skipped across
western Kentucky and north-central Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
Two National Guard helicopters were sent to make an aerial
survey of the damage Tuesday, and 30 Guard troops were sent to
help out in the small town of Crayne, south of Marion, according

SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va., January 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton held a "very productive" meeting with Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Shara
Tuesday, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who returned to the West Virginian town for the
trilateral meeting, first met Barak before Shara joined in. The
three-way meeting lasted one hour.
</P>
<P>
"This was a very productive meeting," Lockhart told reporters
outside the Clarion Conference Center where the talks are being
held.
</P>
<P>
"Both sides have gotten together and are getting down to
business. Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to the process, a
process that we expect to be comprehensive and rigorous," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said committees were formed "to cover all of the issues
over the next few days." The committees -- working groups for each
major issue in the peace process -- would include U.S.
representatives and would begin meeting Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, State Department spokesman James Rubin described the
meeting as "a very constructive and productive discussion that put
the process clearly on track."
</P>
<P>
Both Barak and Shara "reaffirmed their commitment to the
process," he said
</P>

Rubin said the talks will continue at least for the rest of
this week. "I don't have an end point," he said.

<HEADLINE> Italy, DPRK Establish Diplomatic Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Italy and the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) decided to establish diplomatic ties and
exchange ambassadors, the Italian Foreign Ministry announced here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry said relations had been established "on
the basis of the international principles of mutual respect for
sovereignty and equality."
</P>
<P>
Letters attesting to the accord were exchanged Tuesday by
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini and the DPRK's permanent
representative at the United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO).
</P>
<P>
Italy will accredit with the DPRK its ambassador to China as a
non-resident ambassador.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry noted that the accord completed Italy's
relations with the U.N. nations -- the DPRK being the only one
with which it did not have ties before today.
</P>
<P>
Italy has recognized the DPRK as a state and has had several
contacts at various levels in the recent past.
</P>
<P>
The last was the September 1999 meeting between Dini and his
DPRK confrere Paek Nam Sun on the sidelines of the U.N. General
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's move made Italy the first Group of Seven member to
open diplomatic ties with the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
The Group of Seven most industrialized nations are the United
States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Warns Against Pressure on Water Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Turkey said Tuesday that it fully
supports peace between Israel and Syria, but will not accept it at
any cost, reported the Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The clarification came against the backdrop that the second
round of peace talks between Israel and Syria were underway in the
Virginia of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Turkey worries that the U.S. may press Ankara to concede on the
water issue while Israel and Syria are approaching a final deal, as
a compensation to Syria's water demands. Syria has grievances over
Turkey's refusal to allow more Euphrates water to flow into Syria.
</P>
<P>
Water was a critical issue in the negotiations between Israel
and Syria four years ago in Washington, which ended with no
results. The Israelis had previously confirmed that they
talked about the water issue with the Syrians. The Golan Heights,
occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East War, is rich in water
resources. Under a perspective of a peace deal, Israel will
maintain the water resources and provide Syria with the water it
needs elsewhere. It was reported that Israel and the U.S. might ask
Ankara to give more water to Syria.
</P>
<P>
Unidentified diplomatic sources were quoted as saying that
Ankara has held that peace between Israel and Syria should not be
realized at the expenses of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is reluctant to internationalize the water issue, citing
Syrian support for its outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party. It has
insisted that the distribution of water is an internal affair and
should be solved through bilateral negotiations between Turkey and
Syria.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that any suggestion that Turkey makes
concessions on water issue is out of the question, and that Turkey
has conveyed the view to the sides concerned more than once and at
different levels.
</P>
<P>
However, he said there has been no signal from the U.S.and
Israel that they would pressure Turkey in this respect.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Release Another 22 Palestinian Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Israel decided on Tuesday to
release another 22 Palestinian prisoners as a gesture of goodwill,
according to Voice of Palestine radio.
</P>
<P>
Those 22 Palestinian prisoners will be freed on Wednesday to
reunite with their families before January 8 when the Muslim holy
fasting month of Ramadan ends, the Radio quoted Palestinian
officials as reporting.
</P>
<P>
The release has nothing to do with the newly signed Sharm el
Sheikh peace deal, but to extend Israel's goodwill to the
Palestinians, the officials added.
</P>
<P>
Israel freed 33 Palestinian prisoners last Tuesday and Wednesday
in the third batch. A total of 350 Palestinian prisoners had been
released since the signing of the Sharm el Sheikh memo in
September.
</P>
<P>
The memo also calls for the withdrawal of Israeli troops from
another 18.1 percent of the West Bank in three stages that ends in
January 20. The first land transfer of 7 percent was carried out on
September 10 last year as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
A new agreement on Israel's second-stage troop redeployment
reached by the Israeli and Palestinian negotiators here Tuesday,
and the maps outlining the areas to be handed over were signed in
Tel Aviv Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Under the new agreement, Israel will hand over 5 percent of the
West Bank territories to the Palestinians within days. A third
handover of another 6.1 percent of the West Bank land will be
carried out January 20.

<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese First Vice President
Ali Osman Taha on Tuesday met here with visiting Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa on a number of issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Taha said that the decision taken by
President Omar al-Bashir on December 12 was widely appreciated and
it would contribute to realizing the long-aspired national
reconciliation in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Bashir dissolved the parliament and declared a state of
emergency for three months over a row with Speaker of the National
Assembly (parliament) Hassan al Turabi. This was regarded as a pre-
emptive move against the parliament attempt to reduce the
president's powers.
</P>
<P>
Moussa, who arrived here earlier in the day for a one-day visit,
told reporters after the meeting that his "friendly" talks with
Taha also tackled the situation in southern Sudan, the initiatives
by Egypt, Libya and the Inter-governmental Authority for
Development (IGAD) aiming at achieving peace in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government forces have been fighting with southern
rebels, led by John Garang, who are seeking increased autonomy for
the predominantly African, animist and Christian south since 1983
from the Islamic government in the north.
</P>
<P>
It was President Bashir who stripped Turabi of his power, said
Moussa while answering a question about Turabi's claim that Egypt,
Libya and Uganda conspired against him.
</P>
<P>
On the Sudanese-Egyptian ties, Moussa said there are many issues
to be addressed in a friendly manner.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was also attended by Sudanese Foreign Minister
Mustafa Ismail and his Libyan counterpart Omar Mustafa al-Montassir
who arrived here from Tripoli in the day.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Moussa had met with Bashir and conveyed him
a verbal message from his Egyptian counterpart Hosni Mubarak.

JERUSALEM -- A plaque to commemorate former Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin was found damaged Tuesday in an apparent
revenge by some rightwing extremists, Jerusalem police sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Initial reports said that the desecration is related to last
week's demolition of the shrine to Baruch Goldstein, a Jewish
settler who killed 29 kneeling Muslim worshipers in a Hebron mosque
nearly six years ago.
</P>
<P>
Police is investigating Tuesday's incident, in which rightists
also stained nearby areas with anti-Rabin graffiti. However, police
said, the threatened grave of Rabin on Mountain Herzl in Jerusalem
was safe because police had posted guards there.

JERUSALEM -- President Ezer Weizman has come under increasing

Yoav Yitzhak, a journalist for the business newspaper Globes,
said that even after being elected president in 1993, Weizman
continued to draw money from an undisclosed fund which he had
received from a French Jewish millionaire.
</P>
<P>
Yitzhak charged that from 1993 to 1995, Weizman and his family
withdrew 65,000 U.S. dollars from a trust account he opened after
receiving 6.5 million dollars from French businessman Eduoard
Seroussi between 1982 and 1984.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Awarded C$2 Million for Wrong Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- A Newfoundlander has been awarded
2 million Canadian dollars (about 1.4 million U.S. dollars) by the
local court to win a suit against a hospital misdiagnosis.
</P>
<P>
The man suffering from chest pains was mistreated for stomach
pains at the Health Sciences Center in 1989, a local press report
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Gilbert Kieley, who sued for negligence after later tests,
indicated that he had in fact suffered from a heart attack, which
caused permanent heart damage as a result of wrong medical
treatment.
</P>
<P>
The Court of Appeal ruled in his favor last month, saying the
local hospital staff failed to read test results that would have
confirmed the attack.

<HEADLINE> Dole Supports Bush for U.S. Presidential Nomination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. Red Cross
President Elizabeth Dole endorsed George W. Bush Tuesday for the
Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
Dole, who quit her own campaign in October due to lack of money,
said the Republican Party should rally to "another Western
governor" in Bush, just as the party did in 1980 for Reagan, the
former California chief executive.
</P>
<P>
Texas governor Bush would restore trust in the White House,
Dole, who was the transportation secretary in the Reagan
Administration, told a crowd of about 350 people at a restaurant
at Bedford, New Hampshire State.
</P>
<P>
She said Bush would be "just as bold at challenging the status
quo. Just as resolved to restore pride in our institutions. Just
as determined to be himself."
</P>
<P>
Observers said Dole's endorsement could strengthen Bush's ties
with female voters, a group which traditionally has been a source
of Democratic strength but has shown warmth toward Bush in polls.
</P>
<P>
Bush, who is the Republican Party front-runner for presidential
nomination, expressed his happiness to pick up Dole's endorsement
and called her an "articulate and capable woman."
</P>
<P>
Asked about the possibility of choosing her as the party's vice
presidential candidate, Bush said, "First things first. It's
important to have a strong woman like Elizabeth Dole standing by
my side to help me win the primaries and the caucuses."
</P>
<P>
Dole, who declined to be drawn into vice presidential
speculation, said that "the governor has got to win the nomination
and when he does, the party is very fortunate to have a large
number of very talented leaders with great experience from which
he can choose."

<HEADLINE> 1999 Record Year For IPE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Volumes of trade at The
International Petroleum Exchange (IPE) reached their highest ever
level last year.
</P>
<P>
Total volumes of trade for all contracts rose above 23 million
lots, almost a fifth higher than 1998 levels, IPE announced
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This represents 21 billion barrels of oil, and more than 9
billion therms of natural gas. At today's prices, total exchange
traded volume is worth more than 500 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The extraordinary swings in oil prices experienced over the
year was demonstrated by movements in Brent Crude futures, which
is a key part of the complex used as a benchmark for two thirds of
the world's internationally traded crude oil.
</P>
<P>
Brent Crude futures accounted for about 70 percent of total
volume, trading almost 16 million lots which represents a 17
percent rise from the previous year, IPE said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Council Takes New Steps to Enhance Transparency of Its Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 4 (Xinhua) -- In an on-going effort to
increase transparency of its work, the United Nations Security
Council has approved a set of new procedures designed to keep non-
members of the council better informed about the status of its
deliberations.
</P>
<P>
According to a note by the council president released Tuesday
at the U.N. headquarters, an agreement has been reached to make
drafts of resolutions and presidential statements available to non-
members as soon as they are introduced within informal
consultations of the 15-member council.
</P>
<P>
The council also noted the importance of the current practice
of briefings conducted by its presidency for non-members. The
council stressed that such briefings should be "substantive and
detailed" and should cover elements presented by the president of
the press.
</P>
<P>
On another procedural matter, council members have restated
their view that there should be increased recourse to public
meetings and have agreed to use "a range of meeting options from
which they can select the one best suited to facilitate specific
discussions."
</P>
<P>
In the format of public meetings convened to adopt action or
hold debates, council non-members will participate in accordance
with the U.N. Charter, the president's note said.
</P>
<P>
The council will also convene private meetings to hold various
briefings and debates, which any interested non-member may attend.
</P>
<P>
The other format of private meetings would allow attendance by
certain non-members whose interests are particularly affected by
the matter under consideration, such as parties to conflict.
</P>
<P>
Private meetings will be also used to permit transaction of
Security Council business which only members of the council attend,
such as appointment of the secretary-general.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Calls for Impartiality of State TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
on Tuesday called on the state-run television (IRIB) to maintain
impartiality in its programs to ensure peaceful atmosphere for the
forthcoming parliamentary elections slated for February 18.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with the IRIB supervisory board, Khatami said that
the IRIB should keep aloof of the political cross-currents to
maintain national peace, especially on the eve of the parliamentary
elections.
</P>
<P>
He advised the IRIB supervisory board to impartially evaluate
the programs on the political, social, cultural and economic
developments, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian moderate factions have accused the IRIB, which is
under direct control of the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,
of siding with the powerful conservatives in elections since
Khatami was elected in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Some prominent reformists have warned the IRIB against any moves
to side with the conservatives in the forthcoming parliamentary
polling, which is believed to be sensitive in creating a new
balance of power in the country.
</P>
<P>
Khatami underlined that the television should promote mutual
trust between the government and the people, adding that the
destruction of that trust would eventually undermine the national
security.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the IRIB to respect public opinions.
</P>
<P>
According to the constitution, representatives of heads of the
government's three branches should supervise the IRIB, Khatami
said. He called on the supervisory board to fulfill the
constitutional provision in that respect.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Parliament Delays Debate on Press Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Majlis (parliament) on
Tuesday postponed for three months debate on a controversial bill
to revise the press law aiming at restricting press freedom.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 195 Majlis deputies present at the session, 111 voted
for the postponement while 84 others against, the Islamic Republic
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
This was viewed as a victory for the moderates who were opposed
to whittling press freedom.
</P>
<P>
In July the conservatives-dominated Majlis passed the general
outlines of the bill in a first reading, triggering strong protest
from university students which culminated in a political unrest.
</P>
<P>
Without permission, riot police stormed into Tehran University
dormitory in a massive crackdown. The move provoked a week-long
confrontation between students and police and forced Supreme Leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to step in.
</P>
<P>
Now the conservatives are pressing for the passing of the bill
before the February parliamentary elections, fearing that they
might lose majority if contested by the moderates who enjoy popular
support.
</P>
<P>
Since moderate President Mohammad Khatami came to power in 1997,
there has been growing loosening of control over the press. But
this was seen by the conservative camp as a threat to the Islamic
regime.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to quench the liberal tendency, the conservatives
exerts their powers. During the past two years, about six moderate
newspapers were order to shut down by the revolutionary and special
cleric courts and Abdollah Nouri, a famous reformist and managing
director of the banned daily Khordad, was sentenced to a five-year
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that bargaining on the bill would give the
moderates who support Khatami's reformist policies a chance to
revoke the bill, if they win a majority in the coming parliamentary
polling.

<HEADLINE> Researchers Link Enzyme Deficiency to Miscarriages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Doctors at the University of
Toronto have discovered that women having an enzyme deficiency are
more likely to miscarry, be infertile and suffer stillbirths.
</P>
<P>
The findings suggest that mothers carrying the deficient enzyme
pass it on during pregnancy, causing the foetus to die or develop
defects, the National Post newspaper of Canada reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The hereditary deficient enzyme is carried by more than 400
million people in the world, said the report.
</P>
<P>
"This kind of information is very helpful in trying to figure
out why there is so much pregnancy loss and why a lot of the eggs
that get fertilized don't end up to be healthy babies," Dr.
Barbara Hales at Montreal's McGill University was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that up to 75 percent of fertilized eggs do not
survive the gestation process, the report said, adding that in
Canada, more than 3 million people carry the deficient enzyme
known as G6PD (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase).
</P>
<P>
The new Canadian research result came after a three-year study
led by Dr. Peter Wells, with the faculty of pharmacy at the
University of Toronto.
</P>
<P>
In the study, researchers compared mice with varying degrees of
the enzyme deficiency to normal ones in pregnancy and found higher
rates of prenatal and postnatal death in the deficient group.

<P>
LONDON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Britain Tuesday congratulated
Croatia's main center-left opposition on its victory in the just
finished national election.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook telephoned Croatian Social
Democrat leader Ivica Racan, who will head the new government, a
Foreign Office spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Cook said that he hoped that the new government would be
building an open and democratic society and that Britain wanted to
help in their endeavors to achieve this change," said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Croatia held a national election Monday. With 99 percent of the
votes counted, the alliance uniting the reformed communist Social
Democratic Party and the Social Liberals won nine of the lower
house's 11 multi-member constituencies.
</P>
<P>
Croatian state television predicted that the result would give
the alliance some 70 seats in a 152-seat assembly. The alliance
had already said they would form a coalition government with a
bloc of four centrist parties which look set to take 24 seats.

<HEADLINE> Britain Enjoys Relief Over Y2K Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The London Stock Exchange, the last major international market
to reopen in the new century, came back on line at 0800 GMT and
reported no bug problems.
</P>
<P>
"I think we're all a lot more optimistic than we were on New
Year's Eve because there has been much less difficulty, "Margaret
Beckett, the minister responsible for tackling the bug said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have come through that far better than we dared of hope and
so I think we can be cautiously optimistic," she said.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet Office's central monitoring center in London was
quiet on Tuesday morning, with no major problems reported.
</P>
<P>
The positive indications echoed the experience of countries
across the globe, none of which has suffered to any great extent.
</P>
<P>
Britain spent billions of pounds on anti-millennium measures in
the run-up to the potentially-problematic date change. The money
seems to have been well spent.
</P>
<P>
The full effectiveness of Britain's multi-million pound battle
with the bug will be clearer in the weeks to come.
</P>
<P>
But Beckett urged people to take precautions as they returned
to work. She pointed out there were still problems to face, such
as the leap year transition at the end of February.
</P>
<P>
British government spent about 430 million pounds (about 690
million U.S.dollars) preparing for the bug while private industry
is thought to have spent up to 20 billion pounds (some 32 billion
U.S. dollars) in eradicating potential problems and putting
contingency plans in place.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, the Bank of England said that there had been a
few minor glitches reported by some financial institutions, but
most of the bug-busting measures had proved effective.
</P>
<P>
The Bank's deputy governor, David Clementi, said it was too
early to declare a complete success.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Robin Guenier, head of the independent bug watchdog
Taskforce 2000, said he remained concerned about databases and
billing systems which might not immediately be effected by the bug,
but which could encounter problems later.
</P>
<P>
"We have a long way to go, the whole of 2000 into 2001, the
potential possibilities, the possible knock on effects, the
possible consequences that are presently not known. It's really
far too early to breathe a sigh of relief and say it's all done,"
Guenier said

<HEADLINE> Clinton Begins Trilateral Meeting with Barak, Shara </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va., January 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton began a trilateral meeting Tuesday with Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Shara in
Shepherdstown, West Virginia, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said Clinton returned from Washington to first meet
with Barak. "There were some procedural issues to overcome and the
discussions are now moving forward," he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Clinton said he was going back to
Shepherdstown for the Syrian-Israeli peace talks and he was
hopeful despite of its rocky start Monday.
</P>
<P>
The scheduled trilateral meeting failed to take place Monday as
there were differences over which should come first for
negotiations. Syria insisted that an Israeli withdrawal from the
Golan Heights should be discussed first while Israel preferred the
security issue.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he was not disappointed that the trilateral
meeting failed to come off Monday. "That was partly my decision.
We just had a lot of other work to do.... I think they are both
very serious. Think they both want an agreement," he added.
</P>
<P>
"We just started, but all the issues are on the table, and it's
a pretty full table, as you might imagine. We're working at it,"
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton drove in a motorcade 65 miles (105 km) from Washington
to try to get the talks back on course.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart did not disclose anything about the trilateral meeting,
only saying that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was present
at the meeting and Clinton was likely to return to Washington
after the meeting.

<HEADLINE> New U.N. Arms Inspection Chief Expected to Be Named Next Week  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The New arms inspection
chief is expected to be named next week by the U.N. Secretary-
General, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General has a short list of candidates for the
position of Executive Chairman of the United Nations Monitoring,
Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC), the successor to
the United Nations Special Commission(UNSCOM) that verifies
disarmament in Iraq, Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
The deadline for the Secretary-General to appoint the Chairman,
in accordance with last month's Security Council resolution, is
January 16 and some action was expected to be taken by Friday,
January 14, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member Security Council adopted a new comprehensive
policy on Iraq by narrow margin on December 17, 1999, which would
establish a new arms regime called UNMOVIC to replace UNSCOM which
has not returned to Iraq since it withdrew from Iraq days before
the U.S.- led military air strikes against Iraq in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to the new policy, UNMOVIC will be in charge of Iraq'
s chemical, biological and ballistic-missile programme and the
International Atomic Energy Agency will be in charge of Iraq's
nuclear programme.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has to appoint an executive
chairman of the UNMOVIC, subject to Council approval within 30
days of adoption of the policy.

<HEADLINE> Namibia Safe for Tourists: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Namibia is generally safe
for visitors apart from the border areas where there has been some
military activities recently, a Namibian tourism official said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Dieter Galue, chairman of Namibia's Tour and Safari
Association, said the killing of three French nationals by gunmen
happened Monday in the northeastern Kavango/Caprivi border areas
where only about five to six percent of visitors head for.
</P>
<P>
The French nationals were killed when four cars were attacked
in two separate incidents by gunmen. Four other people were
wounded, including two foreign aid workers, according to the South
African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
Namibian military officials have blamed "bandits" of the
Angolan rebel movement UNITA for the attacks.
</P>
<P>
Glaue said tourists who head for the northeast usually are on
their way, via Botswana, to the Victoria Falls on the
Zimbabwe/Zambian border.
</P>
<P>
Some 8,000 to 9,000 (4.5 percent) of visitors to the arid
southwest African country are from France, the figure growing at
a rate of about 11 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
Some 200,000 to 250,000 foreign tourists visit Namibia's
deserts, game parks and coastal resorts every year, with the
numbers growing at about nine percent annually, he said.

is one of the fastest-growing markets in the U.S. information
technology (IT) industry and the Internet economy in general. The
firm expected revenues of U.S.-based Web hosting companies to grow
by almost 1 billion U.S. dollars in 1999 alone, bringing them to
over 1.8 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The robust U.S. economy is the leading factor driving growth in
the Web-hosting market, according to IDC. Even more remarkable is
the vigor of the IT industry and in particular the Internet, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
"The Internet economy now encompasses and affects far more than
just the IT industry that fostered it, and Web hosting forms a
core component of this economy because in many respects hosting is
its platform or foundation," said the report. "Without Web hosts
there would be no World Wide Web, which is now the leading
Internet service."
</P>
<P>
According to IDC, the U.S. Web hosting market will increase by
a factor of 10 through 2003, when it will total 18.9 billion
dollars. The United States provides the most lucrative market
opportunities for U.S.-based service providers, but IDC expects
international sales to generate a significant portion of revenue
by 2003.
</P>
<P>
As hosting service providers become more popular, IDC said,
other IT vendors and professional services firms have begun to
target them. The Internet datacenter is becoming a leading
environment for IT development and innovation.
</P>
<P>
In addition, IDC said, what constitutes Web-hosting service is
subject to change. Just a few years ago, Web hosting implied a
simple static Web site on a single dedicated or shared server. Now,
a single Web site may comprise dozens of clustered servers
operating as one or more domains and support several applications
or business process and often drawing on resources hosted in other
locations.

<HEADLINE> London Stock Market Slumps On Interest Rate Fears </HEADLINE>

<HEADLINE> Romania Upgrades Roads With Foreign Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Romania's Transport Ministry
allotted most of the 1.5 billion U.S. dollars contracted with
foreign financial institutions to the upgrading of the national
roads, given the key significance of a country's transport
structures, Danila Bucsa, director of the National Road
Administration (AND), told the local daily Curentul Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The main target set for this year by the AND is to complete
upgrading of the country's only motorway -- the 113-km Bucharest-
Pitesti motorway and commission it by August, Bucsa said, adding
that the AND also plans to start the rehabilitation of the
motorway linking Bucharest and the Black Sea port of Constanta and
to continue the upgrading under way on other important national
highways, such as Brasov-Targu Mures (central Romania),
northwestern Cluj-Satu Mare, southern Bucharest-Alexandria and
Bucharest-Buzau. Part of the work is planned to be completed by
the end of this year, with the remaining by mid-2001.
</P>
<P>
The AND is monitoring, maintaining and repairing more than 15,
000 km of national highways, which carry some 75 percent of the
transport of goods and persons.
</P>
<P>
Bucsa underscored that all the targets set by the AND for 1999
have been met. The budget has covered satisfactorily the
maintenance operations and major rehabilitation work, with the
state budget making a minor contribution to such activities.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Experts Optimistic With Capital Market in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The players of the Romanian
capital market are optimistic as regards the trends of the two
stock exchanges in the year 2000 and consider there are premises
for the real growth of the investment in shares, sources active on
this market were quoted as saying Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the local daily Ziarul Financiar, a rise in the
number of financial titles and in the offer quality is expected
for this year, by the attraction of new issuing companies on the
capital market, following the finalization of the privatization
process in Romania.
</P>
<P>
President of the Romanian Stock Exchange Viorel Marian Pana is
of the opinion that the fiscal reform that starts in Romania in
the year 2000 and the start of the negotiations for accession to
the European Union are positive signs that can attract foreign
investors back to the stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
A diversification of the offer of transaction instruments is
also expected in the new year, with the finalization of a law
regarding the exchanges' operation. When the law comes into force,
the customers of the brokerage companies will be able to
participate in the transactions of futures contracts, governmental
bonds and other kinds of bonds.
</P>
<P>
The diminution in the tax on profit, initiated by the new
cabinet, and the drop in the interests to credits are considered
by the analysts of the market as the main prerequisites for a rise
in the stock exchange quotations. They estimate that this rise
will be higher than the inflation rate and the devaluation of the
Romanian leu currency, which will lead to a rise in real terms of
the stock exchange indices.

<HEADLINE> Nazi Suspect May Face Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The suspected Nazi war criminal ,
Konrad Kalejs, may yet face prosecution as Latvian authorities re-
open their investigations into claims that he committed mass
murder during World War II.
</P>
<P>
The British authorities have started deportation proceedings
against the 86-year-old Latvia-born Australian citizen, because
the police did not have enough evidence to arrest him.
</P>
<P>
But Scotland Yard was continuing its investigations into claims
that Kalejs took part in war crimes against mainly Jewish
civilians.
</P>
<P>
Kalejs was expected to leave Britain by Thursday of his own
free will, and return to Australia.
</P>
<P>
But the Latvian authorities have said this would not affect
their attempts to seek his extradition should fresh evidence be
revealed.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting with the Latvian ambassador in London,
Lord Janner, the head of the Holocaust Education Trust, detailed
the action being taken by the Latvian authorities.
</P>
<P>
He told the BBC they are "re-interviewing the witnesses, they
are looking at all the evidence again, and they are seeking new
evidence and if they get sufficient to warrant a prosecution they
will seek extradition."
</P>
<P>
Kalejs arrived in Britain six months ago after being deported
from Canada and the United States and has been staying at
Catthorpe Manor, Lutterworth, a retirement home run by the Latvian
Welfare Fund.

The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 359.58 or 3.1
percent at 10,997.93. The index fell 139.61 points Monday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index fell 55.80 at 1,399.42 and the technology heavy Nasdaq
composite index fell 229.46 or 5.5 percent at 3,901.69, the
biggest drop ever in history.
</P>
<P>
The market plummeted as fears for higher rates grew when the
Y2K problem was diminishing. The Federal Reserve left rates alone
because of the worries about the monetary system disruption by the
Y2K intrusion.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve raised rates three times last year in an
effort to ward off inflation. Analysts believed the Federal
Reserve officials will shift focus on rates from the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
The other reason for investors to sell shares was profit-taking.
Traders held onto stocks in the final days of 1999 to avoid paying
capital gains taxes and they would not pay taxes on the gains
until 2001 as they sold stocks in the new year.
</P>

Tuesday's sell-off was temporary and stocks will surge again
after the drop, analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Worldwide Chip Sales Hit Record in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGLES, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Worldwide chip revenue hit a
record high of 14.2 billion U.S. dollars in November 1999, up 24.8
percent over the same month in 1998, An American trade association
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
November's semiconductor sales were 6.2 percent higher than the
previous record of 13.4 billion dollars set in October, based on a
three-month moving average, said a sales report from the
Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA). In the first 11 months
of 1999, global chip sales grew 17.1 percent over the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
Sales in November illustrate the continuation of the industry
growth pattern that began in mid-1998, SIA said, and these numbers
show a healthy chip industry with across the board sector growth.
</P>
<P>
Memory product demand is particularly strong with flash memory
increasing 74.2 percent year to date in 1999, primarily driven by
wireless communications, according to SIA. Meanwhile, DRAM has
increased 47.6 percent, with PC and server demand being the major
drivers.
</P>
<P>
Growth was the strongest in the Asia-Pacific region and in
Japan, said the sales report. Chip revenues surged 39.3 percent,
to 3.67 billion dollars in the region in November, compared with
the corresponding month a year ago. Japan's semiconductor sales
jumped 38.6 percent to 3.18 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Chip sales in the Americas grew 16.4 percent in November, to 4.
3 billion dollars. European sales were also up 10.4 percent to 3.
07 billion dollars, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Brings Barak, Shara to Face-to-Face Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHEPHERDSTOWN, W. Va., January 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President
Bill Clinton brought Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouk al-Shara together Tuesday for a trilateral
meeting after procedural disputes were solved.
</P>
<P>
Clinton first met with Barak for a half hour before Shara
entered the meeting. The trilateral meeting had been scheduled for
Monday but it did not take place as the two sides differed over
which comes first in their peace negotiations. Syrian insisted on
putting an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights in the first
place while Israel preferred to discuss security.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said earlier Tuesday
that "the procedural hurdle" that emerged Monday had been overcome,
but he did not say how the two sides solved the dispute.
</P>
<P>
"We got a good start yesterday," Rubin said. "There was a
procedural hang-up in the evening. That hang-up has been overcome.
"
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart also said that the
procedural issues had been smoothed over and "the discussions are
now moving forward."
</P>
<P>
Rubin said committees had been formed to take up all key issues,
and that none would be overlooked by the two sides. He included
terms of the peace Syria is offering in return for the strategic
Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Clinton drove in an motorcade 65 miles (105 km) from Washington
to Shepherdstown for the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Before departure for the trilateral meeting, Clinton said that
it was "partly my decision" not to have the trilateral meeting
Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
He said it was just the beginning of negotiations and all
issues would be on the table, "and it's a pretty full table as you
might imagine. We're working at it."
</P>
<P>
"What we're looking at now up in West Virginia is sort of
figuring out what the process for the next few days is going to be,
" he said.

Shutters, awnings and trash littered the streets of Owensboro

business districts near Kentucky Wesleyan University.
</P>
<P>
Along with the largely unoccupied campus, local officials
estimated some 800 homes and businesses were damaged in the city.
</P>
<P>
Some 5,000 customers were without power and may remain so for
up to three days, said a city utilities spokesman.

"Every road leading on or off the campus is blocked by downed
trees or power lines, so there is no getting in or out, " said
Wesley Poling, the president of the university.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in nearby Crittenden County, a state of emergency
has been declared with as many as 100 homes damaged, and a tornado
was reported in Webster County as the storms skipped across
western Kentucky and north-central Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
Two National Guard helicopters were sent to make an aerial
survey of the damage Tuesday, and 30 Guard troops were sent to
help out in the small town of Crayne, south of Marion, according
to the reports.

SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va., January 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton held a "very productive" meeting with Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Shara
Tuesday, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who returned to the West Virginian town for the
trilateral meeting, first met Barak before Shara joined in. The
three-way meeting lasted one hour.
</P>
<P>
"This was a very productive meeting," Lockhart told reporters
outside the Clarion Conference Center where the talks are being

</P>
<P>
"Both sides have gotten together and are getting down to
business. Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to the process, a
process that we expect to be comprehensive and rigorous," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said committees were formed "to cover all of the issues
over the next few days." The committees -- working groups for each
major issue in the peace process -- would include U.S.
representatives and would begin meeting Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, State Department spokesman James Rubin described the
meeting as "a very constructive and productive discussion that put
the process clearly on track."
</P>
<P>
Both Barak and Shara "reaffirmed their commitment to the

Rubin said the talks will continue at least for the rest of
this week. "I don't have an end point," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Italy and the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) decided to establish diplomatic ties and
exchange ambassadors, the Italian Foreign Ministry announced here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry said relations had been established "on
the basis of the international principles of mutual respect for
sovereignty and equality."
</P>
<P>
Letters attesting to the accord were exchanged Tuesday by
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini and the DPRK's permanent
representative at the United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO).
</P>
<P>
Italy will accredit with the DPRK its ambassador to China as a
non-resident ambassador.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry noted that the accord completed Italy's
relations with the U.N. nations -- the DPRK being the only one
with which it did not have ties before today.
</P>
<P>
Italy has recognized the DPRK as a state and has had several
contacts at various levels in the recent past.
</P>
<P>
The last was the September 1999 meeting between Dini and his
DPRK confrere Paek Nam Sun on the sidelines of the U.N. General
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's move made Italy the first Group of Seven member to
open diplomatic ties with the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
The Group of Seven most industrialized nations are the United
States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Warns Against Pressure on Water Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Turkey said Tuesday that it fully
supports peace between Israel and Syria, but will not accept it at
any cost, reported the Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The clarification came against the backdrop that the second
round of peace talks between Israel and Syria were underway in the
Virginia of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Turkey worries that the U.S. may press Ankara to concede on the
water issue while Israel and Syria are approaching a final deal, as
a compensation to Syria's water demands. Syria has grievances over
Turkey's refusal to allow more Euphrates water to flow into Syria.
</P>
<P>
Water was a critical issue in the negotiations between Israel
and Syria four years ago in Washington, which ended with no
results. The Israelis had previously confirmed that they
talked about the water issue with the Syrians. The Golan Heights,
occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East War, is rich in water
resources. Under a perspective of a peace deal, Israel will
maintain the water resources and provide Syria with the water it
needs elsewhere. It was reported that Israel and the U.S. might ask
Ankara to give more water to Syria.
</P>
<P>
Unidentified diplomatic sources were quoted as saying that
Ankara has held that peace between Israel and Syria should not be
realized at the expenses of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is reluctant to internationalize the water issue, citing
Syrian support for its outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party. It has
insisted that the distribution of water is an internal affair and
should be solved through bilateral negotiations between Turkey and
Syria.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that any suggestion that Turkey makes
concessions on water issue is out of the question, and that Turkey
has conveyed the view to the sides concerned more than once and at
different levels.
</P>
<P>
However, he said there has been no signal from the U.S.and
Israel that they would pressure Turkey in this respect.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Release Another 22 Palestinian Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Israel decided on Tuesday to
release another 22 Palestinian prisoners as a gesture of goodwill,
according to Voice of Palestine radio.
</P>
<P>
Those 22 Palestinian prisoners will be freed on Wednesday to
reunite with their families before January 8 when the Muslim holy
fasting month of Ramadan ends, the Radio quoted Palestinian
officials as reporting.
</P>
<P>
The release has nothing to do with the newly signed Sharm el
Sheikh peace deal, but to extend Israel's goodwill to the
Palestinians, the officials added.
</P>
<P>
Israel freed 33 Palestinian prisoners last Tuesday and Wednesday
in the third batch. A total of 350 Palestinian prisoners had been
released since the signing of the Sharm el Sheikh memo in
September.
</P>
<P>
The memo also calls for the withdrawal of Israeli troops from
another 18.1 percent of the West Bank in three stages that ends in
January 20. The first land transfer of 7 percent was carried out on
September 10 last year as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
A new agreement on Israel's second-stage troop redeployment
reached by the Israeli and Palestinian negotiators here Tuesday,
and the maps outlining the areas to be handed over were signed in
Tel Aviv Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Under the new agreement, Israel will hand over 5 percent of the
West Bank territories to the Palestinians within days. A third
handover of another 6.1 percent of the West Bank land will be
carried out January 20.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM Holds Talks with Sudanese Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese First Vice President
Ali Osman Taha on Tuesday met here with visiting Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa on a number of issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Taha said that the decision taken by
President Omar al-Bashir on December 12 was widely appreciated and
it would contribute to realizing the long-aspired national
reconciliation in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Bashir dissolved the parliament and declared a state of
emergency for three months over a row with Speaker of the National
Assembly (parliament) Hassan al Turabi. This was regarded as a pre-
emptive move against the parliament attempt to reduce the
president's powers.
</P>
<P>
Moussa, who arrived here earlier in the day for a one-day visit,
told reporters after the meeting that his "friendly" talks with
Taha also tackled the situation in southern Sudan, the initiatives
by Egypt, Libya and the Inter-governmental Authority for
Development (IGAD) aiming at achieving peace in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government forces have been fighting with southern
rebels, led by John Garang, who are seeking increased autonomy for
the predominantly African, animist and Christian south since 1983
from the Islamic government in the north.
</P>
<P>
It was President Bashir who stripped Turabi of his power, said
Moussa while answering a question about Turabi's claim that Egypt,
Libya and Uganda conspired against him.
</P>
<P>
On the Sudanese-Egyptian ties, Moussa said there are many issues
to be addressed in a friendly manner.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was also attended by Sudanese Foreign Minister
Mustafa Ismail and his Libyan counterpart Omar Mustafa al-Montassir
who arrived here from Tripoli in the day.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Moussa had met with Bashir and conveyed him
a verbal message from his Egyptian counterpart Hosni Mubarak.

JERUSALEM -- A plaque to commemorate former Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin was found damaged Tuesday in an apparent
revenge by some rightwing extremists, Jerusalem police sources
said.
</P>

Initial reports said that the desecration is related to last
week's demolition of the shrine to Baruch Goldstein, a Jewish
settler who killed 29 kneeling Muslim worshipers in a Hebron mosque
nearly six years ago.
</P>
<P>
Police is investigating Tuesday's incident, in which rightists
also stained nearby areas with anti-Rabin graffiti. However, police
said, the threatened grave of Rabin on Mountain Herzl in Jerusalem
was safe because police had posted guards there.

JERUSALEM -- President Ezer Weizman has come under increasing
pressure to resign Tuesday as an investigative journalist made
additional allegations over a funding scandal surrounding him.
</P>
<P>
Yoav Yitzhak, a journalist for the business newspaper Globes,
said that even after being elected president in 1993, Weizman
continued to draw money from an undisclosed fund which he had
received from a French Jewish millionaire.
</P>
<P>

Seroussi between 1982 and 1984.

JERUSALEM -- Israel decided on Tuesday to release another 22
Palestinian prisoners as a gesture of goodwill, according to Voice
of Palestine radio.
</P>
<P>
Those 22 Palestinian prisoners will be freed on Wednesday to
reunite with their families before January 8 when the Muslim holy
fasting month of Ramadan ends, the Radio quoted Palestinian
officials as reporting.
</P>
<P>

Palestinians, the officials added.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Awarded C$2 Million for Wrong Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- A Newfoundlander has been awarded
2 million Canadian dollars (about 1.4 million U.S. dollars) by the
local court to win a suit against a hospital misdiagnosis.
</P>
<P>
The man suffering from chest pains was mistreated for stomach
pains at the Health Sciences Center in 1989, a local press report
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Gilbert Kieley, who sued for negligence after later tests,
indicated that he had in fact suffered from a heart attack, which
caused permanent heart damage as a result of wrong medical
treatment.
</P>
<P>
The Court of Appeal ruled in his favor last month, saying the
local hospital staff failed to read test results that would have
confirmed the attack.

<HEADLINE> Dole Supports Bush for U.S. Presidential Nomination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. Red Cross
President Elizabeth Dole endorsed George W. Bush Tuesday for the
Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
Dole, who quit her own campaign in October due to lack of money,
said the Republican Party should rally to "another Western
governor" in Bush, just as the party did in 1980 for Reagan, the
former California chief executive.
</P>
<P>
Texas governor Bush would restore trust in the White House,
Dole, who was the transportation secretary in the Reagan
Administration, told a crowd of about 350 people at a restaurant
at Bedford, New Hampshire State.
</P>
<P>
She said Bush would be "just as bold at challenging the status
quo. Just as resolved to restore pride in our institutions. Just
as determined to be himself."
</P>
<P>
Observers said Dole's endorsement could strengthen Bush's ties
with female voters, a group which traditionally has been a source
of Democratic strength but has shown warmth toward Bush in polls.
</P>
<P>
Bush, who is the Republican Party front-runner for presidential
nomination, expressed his happiness to pick up Dole's endorsement
and called her an "articulate and capable woman."
</P>
<P>
Asked about the possibility of choosing her as the party's vice
presidential candidate, Bush said, "First things first. It's
important to have a strong woman like Elizabeth Dole standing by
my side to help me win the primaries and the caucuses."
</P>
<P>
Dole, who declined to be drawn into vice presidential
speculation, said that "the governor has got to win the nomination
and when he does, the party is very fortunate to have a large
number of very talented leaders with great experience from which
he can choose."

<HEADLINE> 1999 Record Year For IPE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Volumes of trade at The
International Petroleum Exchange (IPE) reached their highest ever
level last year.
</P>
<P>
Total volumes of trade for all contracts rose above 23 million
lots, almost a fifth higher than 1998 levels, IPE announced
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This represents 21 billion barrels of oil, and more than 9
billion therms of natural gas. At today's prices, total exchange
traded volume is worth more than 500 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The extraordinary swings in oil prices experienced over the
year was demonstrated by movements in Brent Crude futures, which
is a key part of the complex used as a benchmark for two thirds of
the world's internationally traded crude oil.
</P>
<P>
Brent Crude futures accounted for about 70 percent of total
volume, trading almost 16 million lots which represents a 17
percent rise from the previous year, IPE said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Council Takes New Steps to Enhance Transparency of Its Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 4 (Xinhua) -- In an on-going effort to
increase transparency of its work, the United Nations Security
Council has approved a set of new procedures designed to keep non-
members of the council better informed about the status of its
deliberations.
</P>
<P>
According to a note by the council president released Tuesday
at the U.N. headquarters, an agreement has been reached to make
drafts of resolutions and presidential statements available to non-
members as soon as they are introduced within informal
consultations of the 15-member council.
</P>
<P>
The council also noted the importance of the current practice
of briefings conducted by its presidency for non-members. The
council stressed that such briefings should be "substantive and
detailed" and should cover elements presented by the president of
the press.
</P>
<P>
On another procedural matter, council members have restated
their view that there should be increased recourse to public
meetings and have agreed to use "a range of meeting options from
which they can select the one best suited to facilitate specific
discussions."
</P>
<P>
In the format of public meetings convened to adopt action or
hold debates, council non-members will participate in accordance
with the U.N. Charter, the president's note said.
</P>
<P>
The council will also convene private meetings to hold various
briefings and debates, which any interested non-member may attend.
</P>
<P>
The other format of private meetings would allow attendance by
certain non-members whose interests are particularly affected by
the matter under consideration, such as parties to conflict.
</P>
<P>
Private meetings will be also used to permit transaction of
Security Council business which only members of the council attend,
such as appointment of the secretary-general.
