Mideast Peace Quest Continues
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- As tense Mideast peace talks came to a crossroad,
President Clinton searched Tuesday for settlement terms that balance the diverse
demands of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat. With the clock ticking down to his scheduled departure for Japan on
Wednesday morning, Clinton had dinner on a patio of his cabin at Camp David,
Md., and met with his advisers. ''We will work the night'' through, said White
House spokesman P.J. Crowley.

Fiji Postpones Swearing in Cabinet
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Fiji lurched toward another government crisis Wednesday as
the swearing in of a new Cabinet was postponed indefinitely, a move coup leader
George Speight claimed he orchestrated. Speight was dissatisfied with the
Cabinet, which he said did not include enough of his supporters, and he objected
to not having been adequately consulted in the formulation process, despite a
promise from President Ratu Josefa Iloilo that he would be included in
negotiations. Speight said Iloilo had agreed to allow him to review the list of
prospective ministers and that the ceremony would not proceed.

Senate Eliminates 'Marriage Penalty'
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite a veto threat from President Clinton and
Democratic criticism, Republicans won Senate passage Tuesday of a bill that
would eliminate the ''marriage penalty'' by cutting taxes for virtually all
married couples. The bill would cut taxes for approximately 45 million couples,
including about 25 million two-earner households in which couples pay more than
they would if single. The legislation, approved on a 61-38 vote, would reduce
government revenue by $248 billion over 10 years.

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Al Gore suggested Tuesday that rival George W.
Bush's proposed tax cuts and other fiscal plans would overheat the economy and
push interest rates up. Already, Gore said of the economy, ''We're pushing the
envelope.'' Gore, the Democratic presidential candidate, told contributors to
the Democratic National Committee Tuesday night that Bush and his fellow
Republicans justify what Gore called ''this huuu-uge tax scheme'' by saying it
will ''stimulate higher levels of economic growth.''

   MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- No relief was expected anytime soon from the heat
wave baking Alabama, Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma

Louisiana, three deaths were being investigated as possibly heat related. Two of
the deaths were elderly residents of a hotel for homeless and poor people that

For the three months ended June 30, Microsoft made $2.409 billion, or 44 cents
per share, on sales of $5.80 billion. In the same period a year ago, Microsoft
made $2.202 billion, or 40 cents per share, on sales of $5.76 billion. Analysts

USA Swimming Lifts Bodysuits Ban
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   The governing body of U.S. swimming, bowing to pressure from suit
manufacturers, voted Tuesday night to lift the ban on full-length attire at the
Olympic swimming trials next month. USA Swimming, which voted last month to ban
the high-tech bodysuits because of concerns about availability, reversed course
after its board held a special meeting via conference call. That means any
full-length suit approved by FINA, the world governing organization, will be
allowed at the trials in Indianapolis on Aug. 9-16. The suits already were
cleared for use at the Sydney Olympics and all other meets.

<HEADLINE> Caroline Kennedy to Address Party  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, the only
surviving member of the slain president's immediate family, will
address next month's Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Details, including when she will speak, have yet to be decided,
said Mark Fabiani, a spokesman for Vice President Al Gore. Fabiani
also could not indicate the topic of her remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Schlossberg's brother, John F. Kennedy Jr., addressed the
convention in 1988 to wild cheers as he recounted the legacy of his
father and introduced his uncle, Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy.
That speech prompted speculation that he might enter politics
himself, but he never ran for office before he died last year in an
airplane crash.
</P>
<P>
   She has been careful about her turns in the political spotlight.
In 1992, for instance, she declined to serve as Democratic
Convention chairwoman.
</P>
<P>
   But she frequently appears in public in other capacities. In
May, she presented the annual John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage
Award.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrat National Convention is set for Aug. 14-17 in Los
Angeles. President Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton
are already scheduled to speak on the opening night.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to spread their message across the country, Democrats
Tuesday unveiled a series of Internet-based opportunities for the
public to tap into the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Announcing the initiatives over an Internet news conference,
they said plans include streaming gavel-to-gavel coverage over the
convention Web site and 360 degree cameras that allow users to view
the entire room. They also plan online chats with Democratic
officials and special Web video clips.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, the Republican National Convention is
offering a host of its own cyber-gimmicks, including ''dot-com
delegates,'' who can sign up to get special e-mails and briefings
from their state delegations.
</P>
<P>
   And on Wednesday, Texas Gov. George W. Bush's campaign plans to
launch a redesigned version of his Web site.

<HEADLINE> Firefighter Cleared of Deaths  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- A volunteer firefighter was cleared Tuesday of
charges that he set a fire that killed three people, including an
infant girl, at a home in the Pittsburgh suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   At a coroner's inquest, a pair of judges dismissed all charges
against William D. Blick, 25, deciding that prosecutors failed to
show enough evidence of intent.
</P>
<P>
   Early on July 1, witnesses said, Blick was drinking in the
social club at the Homeville Volunteer Fire Department in West
Mifflin. Blick allegedly got a pack of matches from the bartender,
then left the club.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, a fire alarm sounded at a duplex about 50
yards away. James Rock, 27; his wife, Diane, 39; and their
11-month-old daughter, Caitlyn, died in the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Blick said the blaze started when he flicked a cigarette butt
near the house.
</P>
<P>
   A police dog detected accelerants on Blick's clothing and on the
duplex's back porch, and the Allegheny County chief deputy fire
marshal described the fire as ''inconsistent with a lit
cigarette.''
</P>
<P>
   Blick was cleared of arson, reckless endangerment and three
counts of criminal homicide. One of the judges said charges can be
refiled against Blick if new evidence surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Mark V. Tranquilli declined comment.

<HEADLINE> Dems Battle for Right to Face Barr  </HEADLINE>
By RUSS NUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Millionaire Roger Kahn will face 1998 nominee Jim
Williams in a runoff after they took the top two spots in a
three-way Democratic primary Tuesday for the right to take on
Republican Congressman Bob Barr in November.
</P>
<P>
   With 219 of 221 precincts reporting, Kahn had 17,414 votes or 48
percent. Williams had 11,139 votes or 30 percent. The third
contender, ex-police officer Chip Warren, had 8,022 or 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Though Kahn had a comfortable lead over his challengers, he
needed more than 50 percent of the vote to win the Democratic
nomination without a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Voters will have to return to the polls Aug. 8 to decide which
candidate is the best man to beat Barr, whose loyalty to the gun
lobby and scorn for President Clinton have made him the congressman
Democrats love to hate.
</P>
<P>
   Kahn's personal fortune would guarantee a well-funded fight and
he has raised $1.4 million so far. Williams, who has raised $6,000,
says he deserves a rematch after his pauper's campaign against Barr
in 1998 grabbed 45 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't have anything negative to say about Roger Kahn,''
Williams said. ''Roger's been running for a year and a half. And
there hasn't been an unkind word said.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Kahn: ''The only reason I'm running is because I feel Bob
Barr is the wrong man for Georgia and the wrong man for our
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of Barr's GOP colleagues in the House easily defeated
primary opponents.
</P>
<P>
   In the 11th district, Rep. John Linder defeated
Democrat-turned-Republican Vince Littman. Linder had 87 percent of
the vote with all precincts reporting.
</P>
<P>
   In the 3rd District, Rep. Mac Collins beat maintenance worker
Herb Galloway. Collins had 89 percent of the vote with 209 of 238
precincts counted.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, Barr has represented Georgia's 7th District, which
stretches north and west from the Atlanta suburbs to a wide swath
at the state line.
</P>
<P>
   His three would-be opponents didn't bother debating many issues,
since the No. 1 issue for Democratic voters was picking a candidate
who can win.
</P>
<P>
   While Barr hasn't indicated a preference of opponents,
Democratic Party insiders appeared to be backing Kahn -- the only
one of the three challengers mentioned as a threat in a letter from
Barr to Republican donors.

<HEADLINE> Kennedy Center Names New Chief  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Michael Kaiser, a former opera singer and head
of London's Royal Opera House, will take over at the Kennedy Center
for the Performing Arts early next year, according to a published
report.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser, 47, will replace Lawrence J. Wilker, who announced his
departure in April. Kaiser's appointment will be announced
Wednesday, The Washington Post reported in Wednesday's editions.
The newspaper, quoting sources it did not name, said he would start
Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   A search committee, which included Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.,
voted unanimously to hire Kaiser, the Post said, and he will be
introduced to members of Congress on Wednesday night at an annual
dinner in honor of the center.
</P>
<P>
   ''The news of Michael Kaiser's appointment is indeed exciting,''
Washington Opera Artistic Director Placido Domingo was quoted as
saying in a statement. ''He brings with him such an impressive
track record of giving extraordinary stability to arts
organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser resigned from the Royal Opera House a month ago after 19
months on the job. Previously, he headed the American Ballet
Theatre, where he erased the entire accumulated deficit and
increased income substantially. Kaiser also engineered the
turnarounds of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and the State
Ballet of Missouri. A native of New York City, Kaiser studied
violin and trained as an opera baritone, performing in the chorus
at Tanglewood.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy Center, which also puts on concerts, plays, musicals
and films, is in the midst of a $170 million renovation program.
Basic improvements are being made to the center's Opera House,
which may become the permanent home of the Washington Opera.

<HEADLINE> Agents Balk at Calif. Insurance  </HEADLINE>
By ANTHONY BREZNICAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The state's showcase program to provide
low-cost car insurance to poor people is under fire from agents who
say the policies are too much trouble to write and aren't
profitable.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, designed to reduce the number of uninsured motorists
by lowering premiums, has received nearly two dozen complaints from
agents since its July 2 inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not happy to sell it,'' Herb Jones, an insurance agent in
the Crenshaw district of Los Angeles, said Tuesday. ''I don't
market it, but if people call me for the policy, I'll tell them the
qualifications.''
</P>
<P>
   The program, which was approved by the Legislature last year, is
run by the California Automobile Assigned Risk Plan, a coalition of
insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   The agents are under no legal obligation to sell the policy,
CAARP regional director Richard Manning said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's their business decision,'' he said. ''It's not hurting
the plan, but it is affecting the consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the program, qualifying motorists in Los Angeles and San
Francisco can obtain low-cost policies that satisfy the minimum
amount of auto insurance required by the state. Only the other
person's car, not the policyholder's, is covered in an accident.
</P>
<P>
   The plan charges $450 annually for a bare-bones auto policy in
Los Angeles County and $410 in the San Francisco area. There is a
25 percent surcharge for unmarried, male drivers 19 to 25.
</P>
<P>
   Participants must have clean driving records and meet income and
other guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 1.8 million vehicles out of 6 million in Los Angeles lack
insurance and nearly 80,000 out of 412,000 in San Francisco,
according to the state Department of Insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from Connecticut, Illinois, New Jersey, Washington,
Kentucky and Louisiana are watching California's four-year pilot
program to gauge its success, Manning said.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say obstinate agents who fail to promote the program
are preventing poverty-stricken drivers from getting the coverage
they need.
</P>
<P>
   ''These agents have a moral and economic responsibility to serve
their communities,'' said Douglas Heller of the Santa Monica-based
Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. ''We're going to urge
any agent unwilling to work with this state-mandated program to
start taking part.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 100 people have signed on to the plan since it began two
weeks ago, and about 3,300 others are pursuing policies, according
to Heller, whose office is monitoring the project's success.
</P>
<P>
   Some agents fear qualified participants will purchase the
insurance, then drop it once they register their cars with the
Department of Motor Vehicles. California's proof-of-insurance law
requires owners of the state's nearly 27 million vehicles to show
they have coverage when they register.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, agents have objected to the hours they have spent
setting up policies for people who say they are qualified, only to
learn later that they are not, said Jones, who is also president of
the American Agents Alliance, a nonprofit organization of
independent insurance brokers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ever since it started, I've been doing a whole lot of work for
nothing,'' said Jones, adding that he makes about a $54 commission
on each low-cost policy he sells.

<HEADLINE> Portugal World's Fair Faces Probe  </HEADLINE>
By CRISTIANA PEREIRA
<TEXT>
<P>
   LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- Once touted as a showcase of Portugal's
can-do mentality, the 1998 world's fair now faces a possible
criminal investigation into mismanagement and alleged murky
dealings that are embarrassing the government.
</P>
<P>
   A Finance Ministry probe uncovered evidence of financial crimes
that could put some of the organizers in jail, according to news
reports Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   For every $470 million spent of the event's funds, $75 million
were misused, the inspectors found.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were sent to Prime Minister Antonio Guterres with a
recommendation that the same sort of mismanagement be averted when
the northern city of Oporto organizes the European culture capital
next year and the country hosts the European soccer championships
in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   The report came as no surprise. The fair was tarnished by
financial scams that came to light before it was over.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a week ago, the national Audit Court revealed the
event posted a loss of $530 million to be paid by the state, even
though the government had said it would cost taxpayers nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The court said the deficit stemmed from cost overruns,
''disastrous'' investments and visitor numbers way below forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   The finance ministry probe reportedly names top officials in the
event's administration as sharing responsibility for mismanagement,
incompetence and lack of transparency.
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors also recommended an investigation into the
contracting of three cruise ships to provide extra accommodation,
which posted a loss of more than $18 million.
</P>
<P>
   The audit court already had pinpointed this deal as ''extremely
disastrous'' because the ships' occupancy rates averaged just 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The organizers of Expo '98 predicted some 15 million visitors
but only 10 million came to the four-month exhibition in the
Portuguese capital.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the same problems are dogging the Expo 2000 world's fair
in Hanover, Germany, which opened June 1, casting doubt on the
appeal of such events in modern times.
</P>
<P>
   Facing huge deficits and far fewer visitors than hoped, Hanover
officials have slashed ticket prices and increased advertising
while dropping the original goal of selling 40 million tickets as
unrealistic. Expo 2000 attracted only 3 million visitors during the
first five weeks.

<HEADLINE> Mets 11, Blue Jays 7  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- It was time for Mike Piazza to unload.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza hit a grand slam, breaking a lightbulb on a SkyDome
clock, and the New York Mets defeated the Toronto Blue Jays 11-7
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   After Chris Carpenter (7-9) loaded the bases by walking Lenny
Harris, Derek Bell and Edgardo Alfonzo in the fifth inning, Piazza
crushed a ball over the Windows restaurant in left-center field.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ball was still going up when it hit,'' manager Bobby
Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza has four homers in his last five games and 27 this
season. He tied a club record with his third slam of the season,
and has 12 in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hit it pretty hard,'' Piazza said. ''I was just so relaxed
and tension free. It was the only good swing I had all night.''
</P>
<P>
   Toronto's Shannon Stewart tied a major league record with four
doubles.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart went 4-for-5 for the Blue Jays, who had a season-high 11
extra-base hits, including eight doubles.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter, projected to be Toronto's No. 2 starter, has allowed
36 earned runs in his last 23 1-3 innings. The 25-year-old
right-hander gave up seven runs on five hits, and six walks in
four-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes he shows he wants to fight through it, and other
times he just hangs his head,'' Blue Jays manager Jim Fregosi said.
''I can understand a ball getting hit out of the park. It's the
walks that bother me.''
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter, who underwent elbow surgery last September, said he's
healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm fine,'' he said. ''This is frustrating on Fregosi as it is
for me. It's frustrating because he's seen me pitch well.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby J. Jones (4-4) gave up five runs on 10 hits, including
seven doubles and nine extra-base hits in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   ''I made some mistakes, but I thought I made a lot of good
pitches,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, replacing the injured Robin Ventura at third, led off
the game with a homer. Harris, who went 3-for-4 on Monday night,
also hit an RBI double in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Consecutive doubles by Stewart and Craig Grebeck tied it at 1 in
the bottom half. After Darrin Fletcher doubled in the second,
Stewart doubled again to give Toronto a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo's RBI single in the third tied it.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Batista's run-scoring single in the bottom half gave
Toronto the lead again, but Joe McEwing's RBI grounder in the
fourth tied it. Piazza gave the Mets a 7-3 lead an inning later.
</P>
<P>
   ''Piazza got him,'' Fletcher said. ''He hits them hard
consistently.''
</P>
<P>
   Brad Fullmer homered for Toronto in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Consecutive doubles by Bell and Alfonzo made it 8-4 in the
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Mondesi's seventh-inning homer, his 24th, off a SkyDome
restaurant in left field, cut it to 8-5.
</P>
<P>
   Bell's two-run homer in the eighth made it 11-5.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Mets won two straight after losing nine of 12. ...
Harris homered leading off a game two other times. ... Ventura is
on the 15-day disabled list with a bruise in his right rotator
cuff. ... Toronto right-hander Leo Estrella, making his major
league debut, gave up one run on five hits in three innings. The
former Mets' prospect was called up from Triple-A Syracuse before
the game. The Blue Jays demoted right-hander Pasquel Coco, who gave
up four runs in four-plus innings in his debut on Monday. ... The
Mets and Blue Jays finished 9-9 in interleague play. ... Damaso
Garcia had four doubles for Toronto in 1986. ... John Milner in
1976 and Ventura last year also hit three grand slams for the Mets.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Delays Trip To Japan  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- With tense Mideast peace talks at a
crossroads, President Clinton early Wednesday put off his trip to
Japan by a day to extend the Camp David summit.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic move shortly after midnight gave Clinton another
day to try to reach settlement terms that balance the diverse
demands of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton believes his delayed departure is in the best interest
of the Middle East peace process,'' the White House said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The goal remains an agreement before Clinton departs for a
weekend summit with leaders of seven other nations. Even with his
takeoff delayed for a day, he can still arrive in time for meetings
in Okinawa, skipping only preliminary talks in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are intense discussions and negotiations going on now
between the two parties,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said
as evening set in over the serene Catoctin Mountains. ''I think
they understand what they're up against, so far as the issues and
the timing.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met with his staff for about 1&AMP;frac12; hours. ''He stands ready
to talk to either leader separately, together, the negotiators --
whatever we think is peaceful and constructive,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Any agreement is likely to provide Arafat with the Palestinian
state he has long sought, but Barak was said to be holding firm on
East Jerusalem not falling under Palestinian sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's political support is shaky. He faces another
non-confidence vote in the Israeli parliament mounted by the Shas
orthodox religious party, which quit his coalition before the Camp
David summit. Consequently, U.S. mediators are conscious of Barak's
need for gains he could point to in any deal with Arafat that might
help calm opposition to concessions on statehood.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, Israel's parliament speaker, Avraham Burg, said
the talks could end with a partial deal in which Israel recognized
a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   ''Listen, let's not fool ourselves, OK?'' Burg said, having
talked frequently to Barak throughout the summit, now in its eighth
day. ''If it walks like a duck, if it talks like a duck, if it
sounds like a duck, it's a Palestinian state.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton negotiated until dawn Tuesday, the second of
two sessions with Barak ending at 4:30 a.m. Clinton then met with
his staff. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Sandy Berger,
the president's national security assistant, met simultaneously
with Arafat until 5 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Later Tuesday, it was Clinton's turn to meet with the
Palestinian leader.
</P>
<P>
   ''A variety of people have been up most of the night for the
last three nights, so I think you can expect that they're tired,
but they're staying at it,'' Lockart said.
</P>
<P>
   A press plane that was to take reporters to Japan Tuesday night
to cover Clinton's visit to Japan was rescheduled to leave
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, meanwhile, canceled a trip to London in which she was
supposed to speak to the American Bar Association on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding Jerusalem, the toughest of all issues, Barak came to
the summit prepared to offer a deal in which some large Jewish
settlement on the West Bank would come under Israeli sovereignty,
while Palestinian control of areas of the city would be expanded to
predominantly Arab villages in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   But Hasan Abdel Rahman, the Palestine Liberation Organization's
envoy to Washington, said: ''Our position on Jerusalem has not
changed. East Jerusalem is occupied territory, and we have not
changed our position on sovereignty over it.''
</P>
<P>
   During the day, some reports surfaced of progress on the
Jerusalem front. They were attributed to anonymous Palestinian
sources.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart discounted the reports.
</P>
<P>
   With the talks in their eighth day, Lockhart underscored the
urgency of completing the negotiations. ''People understand that
there is not an open-ended or unlimited amount of time, so people
understand the pressure that they're under because the stakes are
high here and the issues are important,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if preparations were under way for a signing ceremony at
the White House, Lockhart said arrangements could be made on a
moment's notice. Underscoring the difficulty of the talks, he said,
''It is very, very difficult to bridge the gap.''

<HEADLINE> Oil Workers Strike in Venezuela  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WARREN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Oil workers and college professors
staged strikes over their separate disputes with the federal
government less than two weeks before national elections.
</P>
<P>
   Oil employees walked off the job for an hour Tuesday to protest
delays in negotiations over a new contract for 40,000 workers.
Professors in public universities struck for 24 hours complaining
of alleged government attacks on their autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   At two universities, the government has replaced chancellors
elected by professors with its own choices, who have subsequently
fired professors unfriendly to the government, said Lourdes
Ramirez, vice president of the Federation of Associations of
University Professors.
</P>
<P>
   The oil workers' strike involved thousands of employees working
without a contract since November at the state-run Petroleos de
Venezuela. Venezuela, the third largest oil exporter in the world,
depends on oil for more than 70 percent of its export earning.
</P>
<P>
   Officials downplayed the significance of both strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ''What this federation is doing is entering into the election
campaign,'' said Maria Castellanos, vice minister of higher
education, said of the teacher strike.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuelans will vote in general elections on July 30 as
required by a new constitution Chavez pushed through last year that
seeks to ''re-legitimize'' public offices, including the
presidency.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Seen Unresponsive To Tragedy  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- When Pan Am flight 103 was blown out of the
sky on over Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21, 1988, one of the 270
victims was Theodora Cohen, a 20-year-old American college student.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 11&AMP;frac12; years, her parents, Susan and Daniel Cohen, of
Cape May Court House, N.J., have waged a relentless struggle to
avenge their daughter's death. In the process, they have been
appalled by what they see as the refusal of the U.S. government to
make the alleged perpetrator -- Libya -- pay a price commensurate
with the crime.
</P>
<P>
   The Cohens are part of a growing group of Americans who are
embittered by the perceived unresponsiveness of their own
government to personal tragedies in which foreign governments are
directly or indirectly involved.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is how far the government should go to satisfy the
grievances of individual Americans when, at times, officials say, a
purely confrontational approach against the offending countries
could harm the national interest.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Cohens, Stephen Flatow had a 20-year-old daughter who
was killed in a terrorist bombing, this one occurring in the Gaza
Strip in 1995. Iran was the alleged culprit, and Flatow, of West
Orange, N.J., can't understand why the government won't do more to
help him recover court-awarded damages totaling $247 million
against Iran.
</P>
<P>
   James Rubin, the recently departed State Department spokesman,
has said the Clinton administration does not believe in judgments
against foreign countries but in negotiations with them.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas A. Johnson, a State Department lawyer, is unhappy with
the government's efforts to help him recover his daughter, Amanda,
who was taken to Sweden by his Swedish-born wife in 1995 in
defiance of a custody order.
</P>
<P>
   He and many other victims of international parental child
abduction believe Attorney General Janet Reno has done little for
them, particularly compared with her decision to use force to
reunite a Cuban father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, and his son, Elian,
this past spring.
</P>
<P>
   ''Janet Reno hasn't given us the time of day,'' says Johnson. In
response, Mary Ryan, assistant secretary of state for consular
affairs, says it's wrong to assume that U.S. officials ''somehow
control the outcome of international parental-child custody
disputes.''
</P>
<P>
   In their new book, ''Pan Am 103,'' the Cohens angrily complain
that neither President Clinton nor President Bush before him seemed
interested in taking decisive action against the terrorists
responsible for the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cohen recalled being in the Oval Office on the day that
Clinton signed legislation in 1996 to punish Libya, the country
held responsible for the Pan Am tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Far from feeling a sense of triumph following a hard-fought
battle, Mrs. Cohen found herself glaring at Clinton. ''I was fully
aware that Clinton, the National Security Council and the State
Department would find ways to dilute or dismantle ILSA,'' she
writes, alluding to the shorthand term for the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   She says events since then have borne out her fears. As for her
decision to attend the signing ceremony, she said, ''I was there
solely as a gesture of defiance.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cohen found Bush equally temporizing. ''I wouldn't shake
George Bush's hand for a million bucks,'' she writes. Bush lost the
respect of the Cohens when he was to take part in a meeting with
Syrian President Hafez al-Assad in the fall of 1991 in hopes of
advancing the Middle East peace process. It was a time when Syria
was considered the chief suspect in the Pan Am bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials defend their record on Pan Am 103,
noting that an exhaustive investigation, including interviews with
14,000 persons in over 50 countries, led to indictments of two
Libyan intelligence agents who are now on trial in the Hague,
Netherlands. In addition, they note, U.N. Security Council
sanctions against Libya were imposed largely as a result of U.S.
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the family members of the Pan Am 103 victims are as
embittered, at least outwardly. Many have disassociated themselves
from the Cohens' hardball tactics and are willing to give the
government the benefit of the doubt.
</P>
<P>
   For the Cohens, that's not an option.
</P>
<P>
   ''By a policy of deliberate neglect, and calculated
indifference,'' Mrs. Cohen writes,'' the government was doing what
it could to silence the Pan Am 103 families and get the bombing out
of the news so that nothing would have to be done about it.''

Clinton Delays Trip To Japan
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- With tense Mideast peace talks at a crossroads,
President Clinton early Wednesday postponed his long-planned to Japan to
continue the search for a settlement. If the president's schedule is not further
delayed, he will arrive in Japan on Friday for the G8 economic summit, one day
later than scheduled. The White House did not indicate whether the president's
decision to remain at Camp David, Md., meant that agreement was possible in the
talks betwen Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat.

Gas Prices Drop Across the Midwest
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Indiana's leading the nation in low gas prices, with
other Midwestern states close behind -- a marked change for a region that a
month ago was crying foul as prices jumped to more than $2 per gallon. Pipeline
problems were blamed for the summer spike in Midwest gas prices, with the
industry saying it couldn't deliver enough fuel to keep prices down. Now the
industry says those problems have been remedied, though the Federal Trade
Commission is investigating whether price-fixing was involved. In two-thirds of
the states in the region, including Indiana, Kansas, Minnesota, Iowa and
Wisconsin, the price for a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline is below the
national average.

Senate Eliminates 'Marriage Penalty'
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite a veto threat from President Clinton and
Democratic criticism, Republicans won Senate passage Tuesday of a bill that
would eliminate the ''marriage penalty'' by cutting taxes for virtually all
married couples. The bill would cut taxes for approximately 45 million couples,
including about 25 million two-earner households in which couples pay more than
they would if single. The legislation, approved on a 61-38 vote, would reduce
government revenue by $248 billion over 10 years.

Heat Wave Shows No Signs of Lifting

   MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- No relief was expected anytime soon from the heat
wave baking Alabama, Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma

Louisiana, three deaths were being investigated as possibly heat related. Two of
the deaths were elderly residents of a hotel for homeless and poor people that

Apple Jumps 17 Percent in Revenue

   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Apple Computer Inc. narrowly beat Wall Street's
earnings expectations and said its economic slump is over, crediting a 43
percent jump in third-quarter operating profits with strong sales of its
signature iMac and PowerBook computers. For the quarter ended July 1, the
company earned $163 million, or 45 cents per share, compared with $104 million,
or 35 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Net income, which included $37
million in investment gains, was $200 million, or 55 cents per share, compared
with $203 million, or 60 cents per share, for the third quarter of 1999, when
the company had investment gains of $114 million.

Montreal. Nomar Garciaparra went 1-for-3 to see his major league-leading batting

<HEADLINE> Neb. Senator Shows Up on V.P. List  </HEADLINE>
By KEVIN O'HANLON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- Some 30 years after earning two Purple
Hearts in Vietnam, Chuck Hagel emerged from political obscurity to
become a U.S. senator. And now he's mentioned frequently as a
potential running mate for likely GOP nominee George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Hagel is best known this year for backing John McCain, the
Arizona senator who lost to Bush in the Republican primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Hagel, 53, is just past the midpoint of his first
Senate term and relatively unknown outside of his home state, some
believe he would add a lot to the ticket of the Texas governor and
likely GOP nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he's got a tremendous amount of appeal,'' said Dick
Shugrue, a political analyst at Creighton University in Omaha.
''It's not just a bunch of hoo-ha. Anybody who meets this guy comes
away ... saying 'Wow!'''
</P>
<P>
   But some argue Hagel has little appeal outside Nebraska, a state
that already leans Republican, with only five electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   Hagel's national profile recently blossomed during the campaign
of McCain. As McCain's campaign co-chairman, Hagel became a
familiar face on national television, acting as a McCain spokesman
during dozens of television interviews. Bush has indicated loyalty
and compatibility are top qualities he's looking for in a running
mate, however, leaving it uncertain whether he would put a McCain
backer on the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate for only three-and-a-half years, Hagel has become
known for speaking his mind and being a GOP team player when
necessary -- once switching his vote to make sure a spending bill
passed.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, Hagel:
</P>
<P>
   --Voted twice to convict President Clinton on impeachment
charges.
</P>
<P>
   --Has aligned himself with the internationalist wing of the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   --Backed efforts to ease the trade embargo for Cuba and supported
removing trade barriers against China.
</P>
<P>
   --Is against abortion except when the mother's life is in danger.
</P>
<P>
   --Has supported attempts to ban so-called partial birth
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   --Favors the death penalty and is opposed to additional gun
control measures.
</P>
<P>
   --Favors allowing people to invest a portion of their Social
Security in private retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
   After watching his party break even in the 1998 Senate races, he
publicly took issue with Republican Senate leaders in a letter.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our 1998 issueless campaign was a deliberate decision,'' he
wrote fellow Republican senators. ''We had no agenda. We can't just
run negative ads about the opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Hagel's childhood was spent moving from one Nebraska town to
another. His father, Charles, was a lumberyard manager who helped
financially ailing businesses recover.
</P>
<P>
   When Hagel was 16, he awoke Christmas morning to find his father
had died suddenly of a brain aneurysm. He then helped his mother
raise his three younger brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Hagel enlisted in the Army in 1967 and volunteered to go to
Vietnam, where he and his brother, Tom, were wounded twice together
while fighting as infantry squad leaders. Hagel was awarded two
Purple Hearts, his brother got three.
</P>
<P>
   He returned home to Nebraska to finish college, then went to
Washington where he held a variety of government jobs, briefly
serving as deputy administrator of the Veterans Administration
under President Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   He then entered the private sector and built his wealth as an
investment banker primarily in the new cellular telephone industry.
He recently reported holding up to $6.35 million in assets and
listed no liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of a massive advertising campaign and his refusal
to resort to negative attack ads, the charismatic millionaire upset
Nebraska Attorney General Don Stenberg in the primary and then
soundly defeated the state's popular Democratic governor, Ben
Nelson, in the 1996 general election.
</P>
<P>
   The senator has a strong independent streak and is not afraid to
buck the GOP power brokers, such as Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   ''My style since I've been up here has been kind of
independent,'' he said while campaigning for McCain. ''I don't
report to Trent Lott. I don't report to anybody but the people of
Nebraska.''

<HEADLINE> Fiji Postpones Swearing in Cabinet  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL ALEXANDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Fiji lurched toward another government crisis
Wednesday as the swearing in of a new Cabinet was postponed
indefinitely, a move coup leader George Speight claimed he
orchestrated.
</P>
<P>
   Speight was dissatisfied with the Cabinet, which he said did not
include enough of his supporters, and he objected to not having
been adequately consulted in the formulation process, despite a
promise from President Ratu Josefa Iloilo that he would be included
in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have been in touch with the president through a high-ranking
chief of mine to express my disappointment,'' Speight told
Australian television's Channel Nine shortly before the
postponement of the swearing in ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Speight said Iloilo had agreed to allow him to review the list
of prospective ministers and that the ceremony would not proceed.
</P>
<P>
   In what could be the first sign of a return to civil unrest by
Speight supporters that paralyzed much of Fiji last week,
landowners staged a sit-in at the small airport in Savu Savu on the
island of Vanua Levu. Military spokesman Maj. Howard Politini said
there were no reports of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the incident was related to Speight, Politini replied:
''Everything is related to Speight.''
</P>
<P>
   Announcing the postponement, Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase said
Iloilo was unwell.
</P>
<P>
   ''Iloilo is ill disposed this morning so he is resting at his
place,'' Qarase said at Borron House, where the ceremony was to
have taken place.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise came just one day after the new Cabinet lineup was
announced.
</P>
<P>
   Local radio reported that five of the 20 Cabinet ministers did
arrive along with four of the 12 assistant ministers. It was not
immediately clear how many of those who didn't attend were
supporters of Speight.
</P>
<P>
   Details of Iloilo's condition could not be independently
verified. The frail 80-year-old tribal chief, who suffers from
Parkinson's disease, was sworn in as president Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Failed businessman Speight first threw Fiji into crisis on May
19 when he led an armed gang into Parliament and took dozens of
lawmakers hostage, including former Prime Minister Mahendra
Chaudhry.
</P>
<P>
   Speight and his supporters finally deserted the parliamentary
complex Wednesday, torching seven vehicles before they left to set
up camp at a school in a nearby village.
</P>
<P>
   Heavily armed government troops immediately moved in and began
combing buildings for explosive devices. Other soldiers kicked the
cover of a pornographic video around the grounds. The grave of a
Speight supporter buried Tuesday was piled high with flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Speight's coup was carried out in the name of guaranteeing
political superiority and affirmative action for indigenous Fijians
and promising redistribution of resources to benefit them.
</P>
<P>
   He freed his last 18 hostages last Thursday as part of a deal
that Speight said would disenfranchise ethnic Indians, who make up
44 percent of the 814,000 population but who dominate the economy
in Fiji, a nation of 320 islands about 2,250 miles northeast of
Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Confusion was apparent after Qarase's announcement, though there
were no immediate signs of unrest. Two sports utility vehicles,
however, were found burned Wednesday morning in front of
Parliament. They were believed to have been burned overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are peeved,'' Kaliopate Tavola, tapped to be foreign
minister in the new Cabinet, said of the postponement. ''We want to
go ahead,'' he said, but added that ''there is obviously a genuine
reason for it.''
</P>
<P>
   At his swearing-in ceremony Tuesday, Iloilo committed himself to
forging reconciliation in his ethnically divided South Pacific
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are one, as one nation and one people,'' Iloilo said.
</P>
<P>
   The new 20-member Cabinet was to have included at least two of
Speight's supporters and no ethnic Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will result in a backlash,'' Speight had said Tuesday.
''They are treading on some dangerous ground. I think they are
going to meet some stiff resistance.''
</P>
<P>
   The only Indian slated to be involved in the new administration
was George Shiu Raj, who was appointed one of two assistant
ministers for multiethnic affairs -- a non-Cabinet post.
</P>
<P>
   The demise of democracy in Fiji already has prompted Australia
and New Zealand to impose sanctions on the country and other
nations are expected to follow suit. Britain announced Tuesday it
was recalling its top diplomat for consultations on the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Tavola said sanctions would be ''disastrous for Fiji'' and urged
the international community ''to have some patience, some
understanding of a complex situation.''

<HEADLINE> Trinidad Cultural Icons Dying  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SCHUSLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) -- The artistic icons who helped
forge Trinidad's multicultural identity are dying off, saddening
the nation where the rhythms imported by African slaves are as
beloved as the ragas introduced by indentured laborers from India.
</P>
<P>
   The first to die was Lord Kitchener -- ''Grand Master'' of
calypso -- of bone marrow cancer on Feb. 11 at age 77. He was
followed by other top musicians, an actor and a dancer. Then Ras
Shorty I, known as the Father of Soca, died July 12 at age 59 of
the same disease as Kitchener -- a coincidence that has lent the
nation's mourning a certain mystical tone.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were the beginnings of what we begin to understand now as
our indigenous culture,'' said Cultural Affairs Minister Daphne
Phillips. ''They ushered in an era of independence, self-knowledge
and achievement, and they glorified Trini culture for the first
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ras Shorty's funeral was scheduled for Wednesday in
Port-of-Spain's Trinity Cathedral.
</P>

   He was born Garfield Blackman and began his career singing
calypso as Lord Shorty. Then he fused traditional calypso with an
up-tempo ''soca'' beat, which he said brought out the true soul of
calypso, bringing together the music of the Caribbean island's two
major ethnic groups -- the descendants of African slaves and those
of indentured laborers from India.
</P>
<P>
   Some people believe growing tension between the two groups, as
well as other modern ills such as corruption and crime, are
cosmically to blame for the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ''People here are very superstitious,'' said businessman Danny
Montano. They conclude ''something has swept the country, something
is wrong, and that's why so many bad things are happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad and Tobago's first archbishop, Anthony Pantin, died in
March after a lifetime of ministering to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   He was followed within weeks by Beryl McBurnie, who celebrated
native dance to the beat of the steel drum, invented in Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   Soon thereafter, Kitchener's right-hand man, known simply as
Popo and famous for his song ''Irene,'' died as well.
</P>
<P>
   Then the charismatic Sundar Popo, who championed ''chutney''
music, or Indian soca, died of heart failure in May at age 57.
Sundar Popo is remembered for ''Your Mother's Love'' and other
hits.
</P>
<P>
   Two other distinguished musicians, Antonio Prospect and Pat
Castagne, followed. Castagne, a Guyanese national, had penned
Trinidad's national anthem, including its well-loved phrase, ''Here
every creed and race find an equal place.''
</P>
<P>
   And in June, actor Horace James -- who invigorated the stage and
taught a generation at the Trinidad Theatre Workshop -- also died.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the people who set up the culture in society are dying and
it has something to do with the political culture pervading the
country,'' said Stephen McClatchie, 45, a property manager. ''We
are entering a state of darkness.''
</P>
<P>
   With all the losses, Phillips wondered whether the ranks of
Calypso will be replenished in rapidly changing -- and arguably
less-inspired -- times.
</P>
<P>
   ''Calypso started as a subtle way of ridiculing the powers that
be'' under British colonialism, she said. ''It expressed what we
had to say at a time when there were few legitimate avenues for
voicing public displeasure, so great attention was placed on
lyrics, which were full of double entendres and puns.''
</P>
<P>
   Young artists today just repeat a simple line with little
meaning, she said. ''The lyrics don't say much at all, they don't
tell stories.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're losing something of that tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Mighty Sparrow, one of the greatest surviving calypsonians still
going strong at 65, said he takes it philosophically when people
ask if he's scared about the series of deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ''I say: 'Scared about what? From the time you arrive you know
you're going to go someday.'''

<HEADLINE> Giants 5, Rangers 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Pinch-hitter Armando Rios' two-out,
three-run homer in the bottom of the ninth inning lifted the San
Francisco Giants over the Texas Rangers 5-3 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, who did not have a runner until Ellis Burks doubled
with one out in the fifth off Rick Helling, scored twice in the
eighth to close to 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth, Burks singled with one out off closer John
Wetteland (3-3) and Rich Aurilia single with two outs.
</P>
<P>
   Rios then hit a 2-0 pitch over the 404-foot sign in left-center
field for his fifth home run of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Fultz (3-1) pitched the ninth for the win.
</P>
<P>
   On the last day of scheduled interleague play, the AL finished
with a 136-115 edge. The New York Yankees and Florida may play a
makeup game.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants chased Helling in the eighth on doubles by J.T Snow
and Bobby Estalella. With two outs, Calvin Murray had a pinch-hit
single off Mike Venafro that made it 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Giants starter Russ Ortiz matched Helling until the seventh when
the Rangers broke through for two runs.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Lamb and Gabe Kapler singled, and both scored when Royce
Clayton sliced a double barely inside first base and into the
right-field corner.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers later threatened to get more, but Rusty Greer lined
out on reliever Alan Embree's first pitch and Helling was easily
doubled off second base.
</P>
<P>
   Texas added a run in the eighth when Lamb singled home Ivan
Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Burks has a 10-game hitting streak. ... Ortiz has struggled
this season, taking a 6.50 ERA into the game. However, he has
allowed just two earned and walked only two in his last two
appearances, which total 12 1-3 innings. ... Helling came into the
game with a 2.92 ERA on the road, fourth-best in the AL. ... Bonds
struck out for the fourth time to end the eighth. ... Rios is
21-of-45 with runners in scoring position.

<HEADLINE> Group Denounces Herbal Food  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumers are being bilked, and maybe
endangered, by dozens of foods spiked with herbal medicines that
falsely claim to do such things as boost brain power or fight
infections, consumer advocates charged.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Science in the Public Interest joined with
Connecticut's attorney general and a renowned herbal expert to
petition the Food and Drug Administration to halt sales of 75
so-called functional foods.
</P>
<P>
   ''The FDA has done a woefully inadequate job of protecting
consumers,'' CSPI attorney Bruce Silverglade said Tuesday,
displaying what he called ''modern-day snake oils:'' snack chips
spiked with echinacea and fruit drinks laced with kava kava and
ginkgo, all claiming miraculous-sounding health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no scientific evidence to support these outlandish
and ridiculous claims,'' said Connecticut Attorney General Richard
Blumenthal, who is investigating the foods and said he soon will
announce a crackdown on deceptive products sold in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ''State action will be forthcoming if the federal government
can't do better'' at preventing manufacturers from ''betraying
consumers,'' Blumenthal added, saying he is asking attorneys
general in other states to investigate, too.
</P>
<P>
   Functional foods claim to have added ingredients that provide an
extra nutrition boost, and some are very healthy, such as orange
juice pumped up with bone-strengthening calcium. Other examples are
cereals containing heart-healthy fiber, and FDA-approved margarines
that contain cholesterol-lowering ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   But the latest fad takes this concept a step further: adding
unproven and largely unregulated herbal dietary supplements to
foods.
</P>
<P>
   ''Herbs are drugs,'' said Varro Tyler, a professor emeritus at
Purdue University and an internationally known herbal expert.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not add Viagra to soup. We do not spray Prozac on corn
chips,'' Tyler said, yet numerous companies claim to add herbs
strong enough to affect health to foods eaten daily by children,
pregnant women and others who could be at risk.
</P>
<P>
   If the herb doses really are strong enough to affect health,
that ''is a disaster waiting to happen,'' he said. If the doses
aren't that strong, then the foods are safe but deceptive.
</P>
<P>
   The Grocery Manufacturers of America defended the $16 billion
functional food industry, accusing the consumer advocates of
''frenzied overreaction.'' The FDA properly regulates foods and
brand-name manufacturers only sell safe products, the industry
group insisted.
</P>
<P>
   But a General Accounting Office report to Congress last week
echoed the state-level concern, calling the FDA's efforts
inadequate to ensure consumer safety.
</P>
<P>
   FDA's food chief refused comment Tuesday. But the agency has
contended that it does not have enough money to crack down on
overall functional foods and instead investigates them
case-by-case.
</P>
<P>
   Among CSPI's complaints:
</P>
<P>
   --GinkgO's brand cereal promises ''sharp thinking,'' as does
Arizona's Rx Memory Elixir tea, because they contain the herb
ginkgo, alleged to improve blood flow in the brain. But ginkgo is
not proven to help memory. Plus, it thins people's blood, leading
doctors to warn that anyone using regular aspirin or other blood
thinners could risk a stroke if they also consume ginkgo.
</P>
<P>
   --Snapple's Moon Tea, Apple &AMP; Eve's Tribal Tonics Relaxation
Cocktail and Hansen's ''d-stress'' sparkling drink contain kava
kava, an herb Tyler called a potent muscle relaxant and sedative.
People in California and Utah have been charged with driving while
intoxicated while under kava's sedative effects, CSPI said.
</P>
<P>
   --Robert's American Gourmet Echinacea Shells snack claims that
''echinacea facilitates the healing process and ... can be an
effective antibiotic.'' The FDA warned Robert's last January that
the antibiotic claim -- which scientists say is completely unproven
-- was a federal violation. Plus, Tyler said echinacea can cause
allergic reactions, particularly in ragweed-allergy sufferers.

<HEADLINE> Putin Heads to North Korea  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- After a display of Russian-Chinese solidarity
against U.S. power, Russian President Vladimir Putin headed to
North Korea on Wednesday for a summit aimed at mending frayed ties
between the once-close allies.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's swing through Beijing and Pyongyang seemed designed to
show that Russia remains an influential player in Asia despite its
shaky economy. That message should serve Putin well when he travels
on to Japan on Thursday to meet the other leaders from the Group of
Eight industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Beijing, Putin laid a wreath at the Monument to
the People's Heroes, an icon of the communist revolution in the
center of Tiananmen Square. He then quickly toured the Forbidden
City, the former imperial palace, and Beihai park, once a pleasure
ground for the emperors.
</P>
<P>
   Clearing Tiananmen Square for his arrival, police detained
scores of followers of the outlawed Falun Gong sect after they
unfurled banners protesting the government's yearlong persecution
of the group. Putin arrived after the clashes, but police
confiscated film from at least one Russian television crew.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Putin held a half-day summit
Tuesday carefully crafted to show a common commitment to fending
off what they see as U.S. global dominance.
</P>
<P>
   They signed two statements, one pledging their nations to closer
cooperation in international affairs, the other attacking a
proposed U.S. national missile shield.
</P>
<P>
   The summit furthered the close ties Putin's predecessor, Boris
Yeltsin, forged with Jiang in the 1990s, putting to rest decades of
Chinese-Soviet hostility.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign of Russia's reviving diplomacy, Putin will
become the first Russian leader to visit North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Once allies and trading partners, Moscow and Pyongyang drifted
apart in the 1990s after the Soviet Union collapsed and Russia
pursued democracy while North Korea refused economic reforms and
sunk into economic torpor.
</P>
<P>
   Pyongyang is now courting outside ties and investment, while
Moscow is keen to help mediate between rivals North Korea and South
Korea.

<HEADLINE> Bush Meeting With High-Tech Council  </HEADLINE>
By JIM VERTUNO
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush wants to compare notes
on issues ranging from Internet privacy, to cyber crime to closing
the so-called ''digital divide'' that sometimes leaves minority
households behind in the computer age during a planned Wednesday
meeting with technology leaders.
</P>
<P>
   About 130 members of the Bush campaign's 350-member high-tech
council, including Dell Computer Corp. chairman Michael Dell, were
scheduled to meet behind closed doors at Austin's Jewish Community
Center.
</P>
<P>
   A 1999 federal report showed a widening technological gap
between whites and minorities, urban and rural citizens. The report
found that black and Hispanic households are only two-fifths as
likely to have access to the Internet as white families. And
households with incomes of $75,000 and above in urban areas, the
report said, are more than 20 times as likely to have it as
households at the lowest income levels.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am excited about all of the opportunities that technology
has given us to make a profound and positive impact on the world,''
said Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ''America is a pioneer in the high-tech industry and it is vital
for us to maintain this status,'' Bush said. '' Leading the world
in innovation will not only improve the lives of Americans, but
will also create many quality jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the meeting was to allow the group to present
Bush with their thoughts and share up-to-the minute information on
the issues, said Bush campaign spokesman Tucker Eskew.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign also was to unveil its revamped Web site. One of
its features will allow users to download event-specific posters or
placards for campaign events.

<HEADLINE> Court To Rule on Pinochet Trial  </HEADLINE>
By EDUARDO GALLARDO
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Police stepped up security ahead of
Supreme Court hearings on whether Gen. Augusto Pinochet can stand
trial for human rights abuses committed during his 17-year
dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   During the three-day legal procedure, the Court will rule on
Pinochet's appeal of a lower-court ruling last month that stripped
him of congressional immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   The first day of the closed-door hearings was to open Wednesday
with a court official's report on the case to the 20 justices.
Seven lawyers for the plaintiffs and one representing Pinochet will
state their arguments over the ensuing two days.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they were stepping up security around the Supreme
Court as both supporters and foes of Pinochet planned
demonstrations. The two groups would be kept apart to prevent
clashes, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet, who faces 143 criminal complaints stemming from his
1973-90 dictatorship, is not required to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Federal judge Juan Guzman, who is seeking Pinochet's
prosecution, has chosen one of the most notorious human rights
cases of the dictatorship to press for a trial: the so-called
''caravan of death.''
</P>
<P>
   The caravan, a group of military officers, toured several cities
shortly after the bloody 1973 coup led by Pinochet. The group
dragged dissidents from jail and executed them. In all, 72 people
were killed and 19 remain missing.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman contends that the 19 disappearances constitution an
ongoing crime -- kidnapping -- and are therefore not covered by the
amnesty Pinochet had issued for abuses committed between 1973 and
1978.
</P>
<P>
   Congressman Pablo Longueira, a Pinochet ally, called Guzman's
theory ''a ridiculous joke, because we all know those people are
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's lawyer insist they will aim to prove the
senator-for-life's ''complete innocence.'' But they are also
considering the former dictator's deteriorating health a possible
way out.
</P>
<P>
   They asked the court to order medical tests on Pinochet before
the hearings. On Tuesday, lawyers for the plaintiffs filed a motion
opposing the tests.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's lawyers say the 84-year-old retired general is not
crazy or demented -- the only cases in which Chilean law exempts the
accused from penal responsibility. But, they say, he cannot be
assured of a fair trial because poor health prevents him from
properly organizing his defense.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, Pinochet was released from home detention in London
after British doctors said he was physically and mentally unfit for
trial. Pinochet suffers from diabetes, has a pacemaker and suffered
three mild strokes in London.
</P>
<P>
   The government has refrained from comment on the ongoing legal
proceedings, saying it cannot interfere with a matter for the
judiciary.

<HEADLINE> Senate Passes Marriage Tax Cut  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House and Senate negotiators hope to resolve
differences quickly between competing bills to cut income taxes for
millions of married couples as Republicans rush to force President
Clinton to veto or sign the measure prior to the national GOP
convention.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders say a veto of the ''marriage penalty'' bill could
put the president and Vice President Al Gore in a tough political
spot, since both have recommended its elimination as long as the
tax cuts are less costly and targeted toward middle- and
lower-income couples.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be very hard to explain,'' Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said. ''Mr. President, are you for
eliminating the marriage penalty tax or not?''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed its version of the bill Tuesday on a 61-38
vote, brushing aside the veto threat and Democratic criticism that
the legislation is skewed to the wealthy. Eight Democrats joined
most Republicans in favor of the 10-year, $248 billion tax cut, but
the margin was not veto-proof.
</P>
<P>
   The House already has passed a bill to cut married couples'
taxes by $182 billion over 10 years, which differs somewhat from
the Senate bill. A House-Senate conference committee will work out
the differences, and GOP leaders intend to finish by week's end.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Tuesday, Clinton repeated his offer to sign the
GOP marriage penalty bill only if Congress also sends him a measure
creating an acceptable Medicare prescription drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the best way to break the partisan logjam and help the
tens of millions of older Americans across this country who face
rising prescription drug costs,'' the president said. ''By itself,
I would veto this bill.''
</P>
<P>
   To draw a distinction between the GOP and Democrats on the tax
issue, Republicans want to get the stand-alone bill to Clinton
before their Philadelphia convention begins July 31. Republicans
also will hold back until September a bill passed last week to
repeal estate taxes so the issues don't get muddied for the public.
</P>
<P>
   Gleeful GOP supporters pointed to new Congressional Budget
Office projections of an enormous $2.17 trillion surplus over the
next decade as evidence of the need to cut taxes as well as pay
down the public debt.
</P>
<P>
   The administration, said House Budget Committee Chairman John
Kasich, R-Ohio, ''is officially out of excuses for not accepting
tax fairness. These growing surpluses must be applied to debt
reduction and tax relief.''
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders want to use a portion of the estimated $102 billion
surplus in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1 to permit people to
benefit in that year from some of the ''marriage penalty'' cut. The
Senate bill delays some key provisions until 2002 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Republicans plan to push for more tax cuts in this
election year, including a proposed expansion in tax-deferred
contributions to retirement accounts and repeal of a 1993 tax
increase imposed on the Social Security benefits of people with
incomes above certain levels.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate-passed ''marriage penalty'' bill would cut taxes for
approximately 45 million couples, including about 25 million
two-earner households in which couples pay more than they would if
single. It also would cut taxes for millions of other couples who
receive a marriage ''bonus'' because one spouse earns the most
income.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would:
</P>
<P>
   --Gradually enlarge the 15 percent and 28 percent income tax
brackets for married couples so they are roughly twice the size of
those for single people. The House bill widens only the 15 percent
bracket.
</P>
<P>
   --In 2001, boost a couple's standard income tax deduction so it
is equal to those of two single people. In 2000 dollars, that's an
increase from $7,350 to $8,800. The House bill is the same.
</P>
<P>
   --Raise by $2,500 the income cap for couples who want to claim
the earned income tax credit. The House bill raises the threshold
by $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   --Ensure that certain personal credits, including the
$500-per-child tax credit, don't ensnare taxpayers in the complex
alternative minimum tax. House treatment is somewhat better.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats heaped scorn on the Republican drive for tax cuts,
saying they risk squandering the surplus to benefit primarily
upper-income people while ignoring such spending priorities as
providing prescription drugs under Medicare and smaller classroom
sizes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very clear that the Republicans in Congress have decided
to put aside their responsibilities and to play politics,'' said
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Citing research from the labor-funded Citizens for Tax Justice,
Democrats said almost 58 percent of major GOP tax cuts passed or
pending this year would go to families with incomes in the top 5
percent, over $130,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are more interested in taking care of their wealthy
friends than working families,'' said House Minority Leader Dick
Gephardt, D-Mo. ''I don't think the American people are dumb. They
don't want the (surplus) money to go to tax cuts for the wealthy.''

<HEADLINE> Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Arrested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Basketball great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was
arrested Tuesday night for investigation of driving under the
influence of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   The former Los Angeles Lakers and UCLA star was arrested about 7
p.m. after the car he was driving was pulled over at a San Fernando
Valley intersection about 30 miles northwest of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   He was booked and released on his own recognizance, said Officer
Eduardo Funes, a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Abdul-Jabbar was very respectful of the officers who
arrested him and very cooperative,'' Funes said.
</P>
<P>
   Drug test results are pending, Funes said, adding he didn't know
what type of test was administered or what caused police to detain
Abdul-Jabbar.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul-Jabbar, who was an assistant coach with the Los Angeles
Clippers this past season, is the NBA's career scoring leader with
38,387 points in the regular season and 44,149 total, including the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   He played in 19 All-Star games and won six MVP awards.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-foot-2 center led the UCLA Bruins to three consecutive
NCAA championships before joining the pros.
</P>
<P>
   He played on six championship teams during his 20-year NBA
career, including one with the Milwaukee Bucks and five with the
Los Angeles Lakers.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Delays Trip For Talks  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- Sending the Camp David summit into
overtime, President Clinton delayed his departure for Japan by a
day to give Mideast negotiators a last chance to break their
deadlock and forge a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The White House announced after midnight that Clinton was
putting off his departure for a summit of industrial powers until
Thursday ''in the best interests of the Middle East peace
process.'' He had been scheduled to depart Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly, the president is doing this so he can continue to
work with the leaders through Wednesday,'' said spokesman P.J.
Crowley, adding that work at the secluded presidential retreat was
continuing into the early hours, as it has in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are still at it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the added wriggle room that an extra day provides,
there were new expressions of pessimism from the Palestinians about
prospects for reaching an agreement. The Palestinians' unofficial
spokeswoman, Hanan Ashrawi, said after her return to the
Palestinian territories that it would take a ''miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis, too, acknowledge that the issues are very
difficult -- although a lawmaker allied with Barak told Israel radio
Wednesday there was ''some room for flexibility'' even on the
ultra-sensitive subject of Jerusalem. But he repeated that
sovereignty over the city could not be shared.
</P>
<P>
   At Camp David, it has become the norm to work far into the
night. Late Tuesday, the president dined with members of his
negotiating team on the back patio of Camp David's Laurel Cabin.
</P>
<P>
   But no new meetings were reported Tuesday between Clinton and
either Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak or Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat. The leaders spent most of the day with their
respective negotiating teams.
</P>
<P>
   Since the summit began July 11, Clinton has been shuttling back
and forth between the two sides, trying to shepherd them toward an
accord on the most painful and divisive issues: the boundaries of a
future Palestinian state, the fate of several million Palestinian
refugees and -- most explosive of all -- the status of Jerusalem,
which both sides claim as their capital.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton leaves Thursday morning as now scheduled, he would
still arrive in time for the Friday-Sunday meeting in Japan's
southernmost province, Okinawa, skipping preliminary talks in
Tokyo. The White House statement expressed ''regrets'' over the
delay.
</P>
<P>
   In Tokyo, Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori's spokesman Kazuhiko
Koshikawa said, ''We understand the circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   A peace agreement struck at Camp David would likely provide
Arafat with the Palestinian state he has fought for nearly all his
life. But Barak was said to be digging in his heels at giving the
Palestinians sovereignty in east Jerusalem, the traditionally Arab
sector of the city where they want to set up their capital.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the effort is Barak's fast-deteriorating political
situation. Just before he left for the talks, his governing
coalition fell apart, and he barely beat back a no-confidence
motion in parliament, and he faces another one.
</P>
<P>
   Other than an absence of about eight hours on Thursday, Clinton
has been at Camp David throughout the talks, leading a marathon
drive for an accord.
</P>
<P>
   ''A variety of people have been up most of the night for the
last three nights, so I think you can expect that they're tired,
but they're staying at it,'' his chief spokesman, Joe Lockhart,
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem, as it has for years, appeared to be the prime
stumbling block to an accord.
</P>
<P>
   Barak came to the summit prepared to offer a deal in which
Israel would assume sovereignty over some large Jewish settlements
in the West Bank close to Jerusalem, while Palestinians would gain
control of some Arab suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   But Hassan Abdel Rahman, the Palestine Liberation Organization's
envoy to Washington, said the Palestinian position was unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   ''East Jerusalem is occupied territory, and we have not changed
our position on sovereignty over it,'' he said Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Serbs Urge Militant's Freedom  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT H. REID
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serbs are blocking roads
into their part of this ethnically divided city and threatening
daily protests until the United Nations frees a Serb militant
jailed for allegedly attacking ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest Monday night of Dalibor Vukovic, 24, part of a group
of militants who screen those entering the Serb-controlled north
bank of the Ibar River, provoked a night of rioting and a day of
protests Tuesday within the largest Serb community left in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Serb leader Oliver Ivanovic said he would meet again Wednesday
with U.N. officials to try to win Vukovic's release. He warned of
violence unless the suspect is freed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over the last 10 months, during clashes around bridges, we had
more than 100 people injured and not a single Albanian is jailed,''
Ivanovic told The Associated Press. ''Fifty-three Serbs were killed
or abducted and not a single Albanian is in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. spokesman Mike Keats said the trouble started after Vukovic
was arrested Monday night on charges of setting fire to Albanian
cars June 9. That triggered a night of rioting in which at least
four Serbs and two U.N. policemen were injured and one policeman
was briefly taken hostage.
</P>
<P>
   Serb sources said nine Serbs were hurt, including a 15-year-old
boy who suffered a gunshot wound.
</P>
<P>
   Unrest continued Tuesday, with hundreds of Serbs massing outside
the main U.N. police station in the north of the city. About 1,000
Serbs rallied Tuesday evening along the main street in the northern
district, and Ivanovic promised daily protests until the suspect is
released.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, French soldiers backed by six armored personnel
carriers blocked the main bridge over the Ibar River. The United
Nations moved reinforcements -- special Pakistani riot police -- into
the ethnic Albanian side. And as the sun set, Polish infantry in
full combat gear were seen taking positions on the
Albanian-controlled south bank.
</P>
<P>
   The unrest occurred while NATO Secretary-General Lord Robertson
and ambassadors of the NATO-member states visited Kosovo for a
firsthand look at the situation here, more than a year after the
beginning of the NATO peacekeeping mission.
</P>
<P>
   In some of his toughest remarks on ethnic violence, Robertson
bluntly warned ethnic Albanian leaders that international
peacekeepers will not allow Albanian extremists to drive Serbs out
of Kosovo and into the hands of Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't underestimate our determination,'' Robertson said before
departing for Bosnia-Herzegovina. ''We are going to protect a
multiethnic society here and we'll do it if necessary by making
sure the individual groups are protected in their homes and
communities.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Serb community must realize that ''some horrifying
violence went on here'' during the 18-month Serb crackdown that
ended in June 1999 after NATO's 78-day bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson also urged the ethnic Albanians to go beyond
denouncing violence against Serbs but to take responsibility for
stopping it.

<HEADLINE> Welch, Johnson Reject Plea Bargain  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL FOY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Olympic bid leaders Tom Welch and Dave
Johnson are ready to prove their innocence at a criminal trial
after rejecting a plea bargain in the Olympic bribery scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Welch and his chief deputy, the main targets of a federal grand
jury investigation, on Monday rejected a second government offer
because it involved prison terms and felony admissions to ''evil
motives and criminal intent,'' Johnson's attorney, Max Wheeler,
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations have broken down and federal conspiracy charges
against the bid leaders could be imminent, he said. Calls to the
Justice Department for comment were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   But Welch and Johnson and their attorneys are confident they can
beat any charges.
</P>
<P>
   The bid leaders have never denied they showered cash payments
and favors on IOC members in their successful effort to win the
2002 Winter Games, but they insist it wasn't criminal.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was never an offer of cash-for-votes, and the government
is not going to have that evidence,'' said Wheeler. He likened the
bid effort to a political campaign where donors implicitly expect
something for their money.
</P>
<P>
   Welch and Johnson have another incentive to reject a felony plea
deal: It would mean they'd have to reimburse the Salt Lake
Organizing Committee for hundreds of thousands of dollars in
attorneys fees.
</P>
<P>
   SLOC President Mitt Romney on Tuesday said the organization will
not change its policy of demanding Welch and Johnson reimburse the
organization if found guilty of a felony by plea or conviction.
</P>
<P>
   The issue came up during a closed-door management meeting
Thursday when one trustee asked whether the policy discouraged
Welch and Johnson from taking a plea bargain and ending the
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ''The board decided, 'We will go after them for reimbursement if
they settle,''' said Romney.
</P>
<P>
   USOC Vice President Sandy Baldwin, who sits on SLOC's management
board, on Tuesday said the SLOC has a tight budget and can't make
an allowance for Welch or Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Welch and Johnson rejected what they considered the
same unacceptable offer made last week by the Justice Department,
said Wheeler, who joined Welch attorney William W. Taylor 3rd for
negotiations in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The bid leaders considered the second offer even worse than the
original felony plea bargain, which they understood would carry no
jail time. But government lawyers on Monday said they would reserve
their right to argue for imprisonment, Wheeler said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They insisted we admit to their version of the facts, which
was the biggest deal-breaker,'' Wheeler said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no question about what was done,'' he said. ''The
issue is whether it was done with a nefarious intention, and it
wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the government deal, Welch and Johnson would have had
to admit to ''sham'' dealings with Salt Lake businessman David
Simmons that allowed him to evade taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons pleaded guilty to tax fraud last summer for deducting
from his business taxes a salary for the son of South Korean IOC
member Kim Un-yong that was paid by the Salt Lake bid committee.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons, a communications executive, told the federal court the
job was a sham designed to get a green card for Kim, who was
indicted for immigration fraud and lying to the FBI. He went back
to South Korea before charges were filed. The Justice Department
considers him a fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   Welch and Johnson also would have had to admit their cash
payments to foreign Olympic committees ''were all a sham'' to
disguise bribes for IOC members, Wheeler said.
</P>
<P>
   The payments ostensibly were made to support poor athletes in
developing countries. A Salt Lake Organizing Committee ethics panel
found the bid lavished $1.2 million in cash, gifts, travel and
other inducements on IOC members and their families.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the game that was being played,'' Wheeler said. ''We
didn't invent the rules. We learned the game after our loss to
Nagano'' for the 1998 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   If plea negotiations fail, Wheeler expects prosecutors to obtain
felony indictments against the bid leaders for a complicated mail
fraud case. The case would allege they deprived trustees of control
by keeping them in the dark about details of the Salt Lake bid.
Prosecutors also could charge violations of Utah's commercial
bribery statute.

<HEADLINE> USA Swimming Lifts Bodysuits Ban  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bodysuit is back.
</P>
<P>
   Bowing to pressure from swimsuit manufacturers, USA Swimming
decided Tuesday night to allow full-length bodysuits at the Olympic
trials next month, likely clearing the way for a major assault on
the record book in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   The American governing body had voted less than a month ago to
ban the high-tech attire because of concerns there wouldn't be
enough suits to go around. But, facing a grievance from one
manufacturer and hearing assurances that all of the 1,300
competitors would have a chance to wear the suits, the board of USA
Swimming changed its mind during a conference call.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was not an easy decision and there are merits to both
sides of the issue,'' said Chuck Wielgus, executive director of USA
Swimming. ''But with the U.S. Olympic team trials being just three
weeks away, it was important to get this issue resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   That means any full-length suit approved by FINA, the world
governing organization, will be allowed at the trials in
Indianapolis on Aug. 9-16. The revolutionary suits -- some of which
cover the entire body except for head, hands and feet -- already
were cleared for use at the Sydney Olympics and all other meets.
</P>
<P>
   ''The board of director's decision today should close the door
on this issue,'' Wielgus said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Van Dyken, who won four gold medals at the Atlanta Games
four years ago, criticized USA Swimming for its original decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''They should overturn the ban,'' she said. ''USA Swimming needs
to take care of their Olympians. It's a swimsuit, for God's
sakes.''
</P>
<P>
   The bodysuit is viewed as the most significant advance in
competitive swimwear since the 1970s, leading to an outbreak of
record-breaking performances this year. Studies have shown it
improves performance by up to 3 percent, a significant amount in a
sport where races are decided by thousandths of a second.
</P>
<P>
   ''The suits are faster than any we've seen,'' said five-time
gold medalist Jenny Thompson, who lowered her 8-year-old American
record in the 100-meter freestyle last weekend at a meet in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The board's reversal came just one day before an arbitration
hearing was scheduled in Irvine, Calif., to hear a grievance filed
by one manufacturer, TYR Sport.
</P>
<P>
   California-based TYR claimed the ban was unnecessary and would
hurt swimmers preparing for the Sydney Games. Another swimwear
company, adidas, offered to provide free bodysuits for everyone at
the trials.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our goal is simply to protect those swimmers whose careers are
at stake and preserve the integrity of the sport,'' TYR spokesman
Chris Wilmoth said.
</P>
<P>
   USA Swimming asked four leading suit manufacturers -- TYR,
adidas, Speedo and Nike -- to make their high-tech suits available
to all swimmers by June 14, giving them plenty of time to get
comfortable in the new attire before the trials.
</P>
<P>
   When only adidas met the deadline, the board voted June 22 to
ban full-length suits at the trials, in which more than 1,300
swimmers are expected to compete.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the manufacturers insisted they could handle the
demand for bodysuits at the trials. They also claimed the June 14
deadline -- nearly two months before the trials -- was unnecessary
because swimmers don't need extensive practice time to get
acclimated to their new attire.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the last week, we have been in contact with the major
swimsuit manufacturers to determine if and how they can meet the
demands of all competitors who will be at the U.S. Olympic team
trials,'' Wielgus said. ''The manufacturers have committed to us
that they can meet the objective of every Olympic trials competitor
having the opportunity to have a full bodysuit.''
</P>
<P>
   He said USA Swimming was given ''detailed production and
distribution plans'' by several manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The competitors, meanwhile, are just glad the dispute is
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ''The swimmers need to focus on swimming and not the suits,''
Thompson said. ''Who cares about the damn suit? In 10 years when
they look at the times, no one will remember what suit they were
wearing.''

<HEADLINE> Commanders Cleared in Gay Murder  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Commanders at an Army base where a homosexual
soldier was bludgeoned to death with a baseball bat by a fellow
soldier should not be held responsible for the incident, Army
investigators concluded.
</P>
<P>
   In a report expected to be made public Friday, the Army's
inspector general also found there is no general ''climate'' of
homophobia at Fort Campbell, Ky., where Pfc. Barry Winchell was
murdered in his barracks last July, senior defense officials
familiar with the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The report found anti-gay attitudes among some members of
Winchell's unit: D Company, 2nd Battalion, 502nd Infantry Regiment
of the 101st Airborne Division, the officials said. It concluded,
however, that the 101st Airborne as a whole harbors no unusual
degree of hatred of homosexuals. The officials agreed to discuss
the report's conclusions Tuesday on condition they not be
identified.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon planned to release the report along with findings
of an advisory group that Defense Secretary William Cohen formed
last spring to draft an ''action plan'' for each of the military
services to address the problem of harassment of gays.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Cohen's panel will recommend that service members
of all ranks receive more tailored forms of training on how to
implement properly the Clinton administration's ''don't ask, don't
tell'' policy on homosexuality. It holds that gays can serve in the
armed forces so long as they don't reveal their sexual orientation.
Cohen appointed the panel after the Defense Department inspector
general reported in March that harassment based on perceived
homosexuality is widespread in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, refused comment Tuesday on
either the Army report or the advisory panel's findings.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Kutteles of Kansas City, Mo., Winchell's mother, said
in a Tuesday interview that she had not read the report, ''but
we're appalled at what we're hearing. We're very disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Her Washington lawyer, Charles Butler, said the Army has
evidence that Winchell's company commander was alerted to anti-gay
harassment before the killing but did not act.
</P>
<P>
   The Army inspector general's investigation at Fort Campbell was
requested by Maj. Gen. Robert T. Clark, commander of the 101st
Airborne at the time of Winchell's slaying. Clark has since been
assigned to an important post in the Pentagon, and the report
concludes that he should be not be held responsible for the
killing.
</P>
<P>
   The report's conclusions are to be reviewed by Clark's
successor, Maj. Gen. Richard A. Cody.
</P>
<P>
   A military court convicted a member of Winchell's unit, Pvt.
Calvin Glover, of murder, and he was sentenced to life in prison.
Winchell's roommate, Spc. Justin Fisher, was sentenced to 12&AMP;frac12; years
in prison for his role. At Glover's trial, soldiers testified that
Winchell was taunted with anti-gay slurs in the months leading up
to his slaying.
</P>
<P>
   The incident renewed a national debate over the Clinton
administration's policy on homosexuals, which critics assert does
not work because it has failed to protect perceived homosexuals
from harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Benecke, co-director of the Servicemembers Legal
Defense Network, a leading critic of the Pentagon's gays policy,
said Tuesday she had not seen the inspector general's report but
has questioned previously the Army's commitment to ensuring that
commanders be held accountable for anti-gay behavior on their
posts.
</P>
<P>
   Benecke said she was aware of news reports that the inspector
general found no fault with Fort Campbell's commanders. ''If that
is true, the Army report will not have a shred of credibility,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her group, which has interviewed soldiers at bases across the
country, including Fort Campbell, believes that harassment of
soldiers perceived to be gay is a major problem not being addressed
by commanders.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Sen. Coverdell Dies at 61  </HEADLINE>
By ERIN McCLAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Sen. Paul Coverdell's death came at the height of
his quick rise to Republican leadership, just days before a
national convention that was to bear the imprint of his tireless
work in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The longtime Georgia politician died Tuesday of a stroke. He was
61.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell, who had reported no serious health problems in the
past, was hospitalized Saturday after complaining of severe
headaches. He had surgery Monday to relieve pressure from a
cerebral hemorrhage but died from swelling in the brain, Piedmont
Hospital said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Paul Coverdell was one of the kindest and most decent men I
met in my entire life,'' said former President Bush, who appointed
Coverdell director of the Peace Corps in 1989, a position he held
until 1991. ''We shall miss him as we would miss our own son.''
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell signed on early as the Senate liaison to Texas Gov.
George W. Bush's presidential campaign and was busy days before his
death preparing for the Republican National Convention, which
begins in Philadelphia in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Paul's soft-spoken, hard-working ways will be sorely missed by
all of us who knew him and loved him,'' the younger Bush added.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell was first elected to the Senate in 1992 by defeating
incumbent Democrat Wyche Fowler Jr. He became the fourth-leading
Republican in the Senate, serving as GOP Conference secretary and
sitting on several committees, including agriculture, finance and
foreign relations.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell built a reputation as an effective, behind-the-scenes
operative for Senate Republicans, working long hours to organize
his colleagues into a unified voice.
</P>
<P>
   He was a close ally of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, who
affectionately called him ''Mikey,'' handing unglamorous tasks or
pointed media questions to Coverdell. Aides said the reference came
from the 1970s TV commercial in which a boy named Mikey agrees to
try Life cereal after his friends won't.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, who announced Coverdell's death in the Senate, expressed
his sympathy to Coverdell's widow, Nancy, his sole survivor. The
couple had no children.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our hearts break also,'' Lott said, his voice choked with
emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell's signature issue for the past four years was
education, specifically his proposal to expand higher education
savings accounts to allow tax-free withdrawals for school expenses
from kindergarten through high school.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton vetoed the measure in 1998, and forced
Republicans to pull it from a year-end budget bill in 1997 under
threat of a veto. The president maintained that the measure would
hurt public schools and benefit only wealthy families. Coverdell
had been pushing the legislation again this year.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell was one of Clinton's most outspoken critics in the
Senate, both on domestic and foreign policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Tuesday night, Clinton honored Coverdell ''for
his years of service as a solider, a public servant, and a
statesman.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Paul Coverdell spent a lifetime serving the people of Georgia
and our country,'' Clinton said. ''He was a tireless advocate who
worked to ensure that all children have access to quality
education.''
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich were the
architects of the modern Republican Party in Georgia. During 16
years in the Georgia Senate, Coverdell was the best known GOP
office holder in a state that was dominated by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   His party-building efforts paid off in 1998, when Coverdell
became the first Republican to win re-election to the Senate from
Georgia since Reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell was born Jan. 20, 1939, in Des Moines, Iowa, and
received a bachelor's degree in journalism in 1961 from the
University of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   He served two years in the Army in Okinawa, Korea and Taiwan
before helping his parents start their Atlanta insurance and
financial services business, Coverdell &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes, a Democrat, has the option of appointing a
successor to serve until a special election in November. The last
senator to die in office was Rhode Island Republican John Chafee,
who died from heart failure last October.

<HEADLINE> Trial Ends For Ex Starr Press Aide  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Accused by prosecutors of lying about news
leaks and painted by his lawyers as a man straining to tell the
truth, ex-Independent Counsel spokesman Charles Bakaly III now
awaits a verdict by the judge who ordered him to trial for contempt
of court.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of Bakaly, a familiar presence to hundreds of reporters
who covered the Monica Lewinsky investigation, rests with U.S.
District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson. Closing arguments in his
non-jury trial ended Tuesday, but the judge gave both sides until
Aug. 11 to submit final legal papers in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The former spokesman for Kenneth Starr is charged with
misleading Johnson in a February 1999 court submission that denied
leaking material to The New York Times. He could face up to six
months in prison if convicted of contempt of court.
</P>
<P>
   The trial was triggered by Johnson's investigation of the leaks.
She acted on a complaint by David Kendall, President Clinton's
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The judge must decide whether Bakaly misled the court when he
denied being the source quoted in a Times article that appeared
Jan. 31, 1999, in the midst of Clinton's impeachment trial. It said
Starr had decided that a sitting president could be indicted.
</P>
<P>
   ''The defendant was untruthful with many falsehoods and lies,''
Justice Department prosecutor Alan Gershel said in his closing
argument. ''This lie is built on a house of cards. One lie begets
another lie. At the end of the day, it all falls apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Gershel contended that Bakaly initially tried to hide his role
from Starr's investigators and the court, but later changed his
story and admitted he provided some information for the article.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyer Michele Roberts scoffed at the accusation that
Bakaly revealed secret matters, describing the material he
disclosed as ''garden variety'' information discussed in every
newspaper and talk show during the Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said her client was trying to inform the judge he did
not provide the reporter ''with any information about (Starr's
office's) intentions'' on a possible Clinton indictment.
</P>
<P>
   She said in that context, ''The statement was true then; the
statement is true now.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts also accused a Starr lawyer of omitting Bakaly's
proposed changes to a court submission last year that would have
more precisely defined his relationship with Times reporter Don Van
Natta Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly, the only defense witness, admitted on the stand Tuesday
that ''as captain of the public affairs ship'' in Starr's office,
''I took full responsibility'' for a story that the defendant once
described as his ''worst nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Gershel, the prosecutor, heatedly argued that Bakaly did no such
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ''This defendant lied when he filed that declaration and lied
when he sat up there under oath and described his conduct,'' said
the prosecutor, as he faced the judge but pointed backward to
Bakaly at the defense table.
</P>
<P>
   Gershel said Bakaly's court submission gave the impression he
leaked nothing to the Times, and the prosecutor enumerated at least
a half-dozen times in the story where he said the spokesman was
among the anonymous ''associates'' of Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The information listed by the prosecutor included four options
available to Starr on indicting the president, a comment on the
strength of a perjury count in the Senate impeachment trial and the
opinion that Starr would not be swayed by polls.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether information such as Starr's options were
widely known, Gershel argued, ''The fact this information came from
inside the (Office of Independent Counsel), ... that changed the
equation'' and amounted to disclosure of secret material.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts blamed Donald Bucklin, Starr's lawyer on grand jury
matters, for the failure to inform the court fully of Bakaly's role
with the Times reporter. She said it was Bucklin's decision to omit
material suggested by the defendant.
</P>
<P>
   Bucklin testified that he did seek to limit information to the
court to keep it from Clinton's defense team. But he also contended
that Bakaly had indeed played down his own role and then changed
his story -- forcing Starr's office to withdraw the denial that it
played any role in the story.

<HEADLINE> Muti Leaves New York Philharmonic  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Riccardo Muti has decided against succeeding
Kurt Masur as music director of the New York Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   Muti, 58, is music director of the La Scala opera house in
Milan, and a regular guest conductor of the Vienna and Berlin
Philharmonics, relationships he intended to maintain even if he
took the New York podium.
</P>
<P>
   ''After thoughtful discussions with the New York Philharmonic, I
realized that due to my commitments at La Scala and elsewhere, I
don't have the time necessary to do what I would like to do
artistically with the New York Philharmonic,'' Muti said.
</P>
<P>
   The Philharmonic must now reopen its search for a successor to
the 73-year-old Masur, whose contract expires in 2002. The job is
among the most important positions in the world of classical music.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Guenther, chairman of the orchestra's board, would not say
why discussions had broken off with the Italian conductor.
</P>
<P>
   ''He loves the orchestra,'' Guenther said. ''But La Scala is his
other love, and I think in the end he didn't feel he could serve
two masters.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Seen Unresponsive To Tragedy  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- When Pan Am flight 103 was blown out of the
sky on over Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21, 1988, one of the 270
victims was Theodora Cohen, a 20-year-old American college student.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 11&AMP;frac12; years, her parents, Susan and Daniel Cohen, of
Cape May Court House, N.J., have waged a relentless struggle to
avenge their daughter's death. In the process, they have been
appalled by what they see as the refusal of the U.S. government to
make the alleged perpetrator -- Libya -- pay a price commensurate
with the crime.
</P>
<P>
   The Cohens are part of a growing group of Americans who are
embittered by the perceived unresponsiveness of their own
government to personal tragedies in which foreign governments are
directly or indirectly involved.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is how far the government should go to satisfy the
grievances of individual Americans when, at times, officials say, a
purely confrontational approach against the offending countries
could harm the national interest.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Cohens, Stephen Flatow had a 20-year-old daughter who
was killed in a terrorist bombing, this one occurring in the Gaza
Strip in 1995. Iran was the alleged culprit, and Flatow, of West
Orange, N.J., can't understand why the government won't do more to
help him recover court-awarded damages totaling $247 million
against Iran.
</P>
<P>
   James Rubin, the recently departed State Department spokesman,
has said the Clinton administration does not believe in judgments
against foreign countries but in negotiations with them.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas A. Johnson, a State Department lawyer, is unhappy with
the government's efforts to help him recover his daughter, Amanda,
who was taken to Sweden by his Swedish-born wife in 1995 in
defiance of a custody order.
</P>
<P>
   He and many other victims of international parental child
abduction believe Attorney General Janet Reno has done little for
them, particularly compared with her decision to use force to
reunite a Cuban father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, and his son, Elian,
this past spring.
</P>
<P>
   ''Janet Reno hasn't given us the time of day,'' says Johnson. In
response, Mary Ryan, assistant secretary of state for consular
affairs, says it's wrong to assume that U.S. officials ''somehow
control the outcome of international parental-child custody
disputes.''
</P>
<P>
   In their new book, ''Pan Am 103,'' the Cohens angrily complain
that neither President Clinton nor President Bush before him seemed
interested in taking decisive action against the terrorists
responsible for the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cohen recalled being in the Oval Office on the day that
Clinton signed legislation in 1996 to punish Libya, the country
held responsible for the Pan Am tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Far from feeling a sense of triumph following a hard-fought
battle, Mrs. Cohen found herself glaring at Clinton. ''I was fully
aware that Clinton, the National Security Council and the State
Department would find ways to dilute or dismantle ILSA,'' she
writes, alluding to the shorthand term for the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   She says events since then have borne out her fears. As for her
decision to attend the signing ceremony, she said, ''I was there
solely as a gesture of defiance.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cohen found Bush equally temporizing. ''I wouldn't shake
George Bush's hand for a million bucks,'' she writes. Bush lost the
respect of the Cohens when he was to take part in a meeting with
Syrian President Hafez al-Assad in the fall of 1991 in hopes of
advancing the Middle East peace process. It was a time when Syria
was considered the chief suspect in the Pan Am bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials defend their record on Pan Am 103,
noting that an exhaustive investigation, including interviews with
14,000 persons in over 50 countries, led to indictments of two
Libyan intelligence agents who are now on trial in the Hague,
Netherlands. In addition, they note, U.N. Security Council
sanctions against Libya were imposed largely as a result of U.S.
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the family members of the Pan Am 103 victims are as
embittered, at least outwardly. Many have disassociated themselves
from the Cohens' hardball tactics and are willing to give the
government the benefit of the doubt.
</P>
<P>
   For the Cohens, that's not an option.
</P>
<P>
   ''By a policy of deliberate neglect, and calculated
indifference,'' Mrs. Cohen writes,'' the government was doing what
it could to silence the Pan Am 103 families and get the bombing out
of the news so that nothing would have to be done about it.''

<HEADLINE> Kids Vote Clinton Most Important  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAHWAH, N.J. (AP) -- Impeached by Congress following his affair
with a 25-year-old intern, President Clinton still reigns supreme
among American children, according to a survey.
</P>
<P>
   He beat out Pope John Paul II, Microsoft founder Bill Gates,
astronaut John Glenn and basketball star Michael Jordan in the
survey that asked children to name the world's most important
person.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, conducted by the World Almanac for Kids and released
this week, offered readers age 6 to 14 the chance to win prizes by
naming their picks and explaining their choices. It was contained
in the 2000 edition.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, the choice of 30 percent of the respondents, was cited
because of his peacekeeping negotiations, his improvements to
education and because he is ''the ruler of a free world.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope, who got 20.6 percent, helps make the world a better
place, the children said. ''My Mom'' got 20.4 percent, ''My Dad,''
15.8 percent, and Gates 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Others receiving votes: civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks,
astronaut Neil Armstrong, ''Harry Potter'' author J.K. Rowling,
slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton, talk show host Rosie O'Donnell and soccer
star Mia Hamm, who beat out God by a slight margin.
</P>
<P>
   Frank McGuire, 10, of Orlando, Fla., won the top prize -- an
expense-paid trip to Washington, D.C. -- for his entry, which named
Bill Gates, Nelson Mandela and Chinese president Jiang Zemin. The
entry was designed like a newspaper page and listed each of his
choices' contributions to society.

<HEADLINE> Census Orders Recount in Chicago  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- The U.S. Census Bureau has ordered a recount of
thousands of city households because some workers may have cut
corners to boost the number of completed questionnaires.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say there was a sudden surge in the completion of
census forms in parts of the city where head counters had met
resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the forms filled out during June showed census takers
relied on neighbors to provide information about occupants of
houses and apartments, rather than talk to the occupants
themselves, the Chicago Tribune reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have some doubt about the quality'' of the count there,
said Steve Jost, a spokesman for the census bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Census officials say they don't know if the questionable
practices raised or lowered Chicago's population count. Those
numbers will be released next year.
</P>
<P>
   They also said they don't yet know what rules, if any, were
skirted, but hope to answer that question during the recount, which
will be completed in August.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the kind of problem we know how to solve,'' Jost said.
''We planned for this -- that there are going to be some people out
there who don't want to follow directions or may not have been
trained properly.''
</P>
<P>
   The recount covers 9,000 households in the wealthy neighborhoods
of Lincoln Park and Lake View, as well as the West Side.
</P>
<P>
   City officials blamed the problem in affluent areas in part on
doormen who refused to let census takers into apartment buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago recount is one of a handful ordered by the census
bureau. The largest recount is taking place in Florida, where
suspected corner-cutting has led census officials to retrace
information gathered from 71,000 households.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the problems, Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., the ranking
Democrat on the House subcommittee on the census, said she believes
the count overall has been efficient and thorough.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened mixed Wednesday, reflecting a
cautious atmosphere as investors digest a slew of factors that
could determine the direction of interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   After the first 15 minutes of trading, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 29.35 at 10,769.27.
</P>
<P>
   Among broader market indicators, the Nasdaq composite index was
down 39.72 at 4,137.45, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 was down 1.54 at

2.28 at 534.
</P>
<P>
   The upswing in blue chip stocks was propelled by a positive
earnings reports from Citigroup, the largest U.S. financial
services company, which said its profits rose 23 percent over the
same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The losses on the Nasdaq extended a selloff that began Tuesday,
and which occurred despite encouraging news on inflation. The Labor
Department reported that consumer inflation -- excluding
skyrocketing fuel costs -- had risen just 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said it's anyone's guess as to whether the Federal
Reserve Board will raise interest rates or leave them stable at its
next meeting Aug. 22.

A 'Witches' Whose Women Fly High   
AN AP ENTERTAINMENT REVIEW
By MATT WOLF
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The three female stars of ''The Witches of
Eastwick'' fly high -- literally -- at the end of the first act of
the much-awaited musical version produced by blockbuster king
Cameron Mackintosh.
</P>
<P>
   As long as its leading ladies join forces vocally, not to
mention aerially, the show flies, too.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, that's often enough to keep director Eric
Schaeffer's production mostly airborne, despite some dead patches
in the second act and a game if underpowered leading man.
</P>
<P>
   The $7 million Anglo-American venture was inspired both by the
John Updike novel and the subsequent Hollywood film.
</P>
<P>
   Ian McShane, stepping into Jack Nicholson's film shoes as the
devil, gives off the air of a fearless neophyte swimmer wading in
over his head. Brave indeed is the man willing to share a musical
stage with Lucie Arnaz, in ravishing voice and figure in her
British stage debut, as well as local favorites Maria Friedman and
Joanna Riding.
</P>
<P>
   Inheriting the roles played in the 1987 Warner Bros. movie by
Cher, Michelle Pfeiffer and Susan Sarandon, Arnaz, Friedman and
Riding constitute a trio worth treasuring -- both separately and
together -- as they forge their own serious sisterhood.
</P>
<P>
   Those who know the movie will recall the outlines of the story,
even if book writer John Dempsey has fashioned a plot whose
specifics largely bypass Michael Cristofer's screenplay in favor of
John Updike's far subtler 1984 source novel.
</P>
<P>
   Subtlety, however, isn't the point here. Fun, pizzazz and a
thinly veiled message are.
</P>
<P>
   At its core, this ''Witches of Eastwick'' tells of a coven of
sorcerers who discover that the secret to life lies within
themselves. Think of the show as a study in self-affirmation wedded
to a battery of special effects, and you'll have exactly the good
time that is the musical's unpretentious goal.
</P>
<P>
   That's quite a contrast, admittedly, from several of the 1980s
blockbusters backed by Mackintosh, who built up a musical empire
with the help of the French Revolution (''Les Miserables'') and the
Vietnam War (''Miss Saigon'').
</P>
<P>
   ''Witches,'' by contrast, occupies a small, churchgoing New
England town -- Eastwick, R.I. to be precise -- that seems to belong
to the less fractious era previously evoked on the musical stage in
''Bye Bye Birdie,'' ''Bells Are Ringing'' and even ''Grease,'' each
of which ''The Witches of Eastwick'' at various times recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while Updike's novel makes allusion to such 1960s
reference points as Janis Joplin, the Pentagon and Ralph Nader, the
musical deliberately chooses to be vague.
</P>
<P>
   When precisely, for example, does the show take place? Judging
by a hairdo or two -- like Rosemary Ashe as the show's chief victim,
the loony Felicia -- the 1950s would be a good guess. But some of
the racier language is far more contemporary. (Those sensitive to
the mention of body parts should stand forewarned.)
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, McShane's amiable Darryl conveys the easygoing
loucheness of a slightly seedy Hugh Hefner, all of which would
suggest that the show is happening at whatever moment in time its
audience wants it to. After all, lovelessness -- its heroines'
shared condition -- has no limitations when it comes to place or
time.
</P>
<P>
   And so we have Arnaz as Alexandra, the sassy den mother of the
three, a sculptress whose erotic objets d'art flourish once Darryl
joins the fold.
</P>
<P>
   How he inspires transformation of the other women is even more
profound -- Friedman's Sukie begins as an inarticulate, sheepish
reporter and blossoms into a deft wordsmith who stops the show with
her first-act patter song, ''Words, Words, Words.'' Her second-act
solo, ''Loose Ends,'' cannot compare.
</P>
<P>
   Cellist Jane sheds her glasses and, with them, her inhibitions,
though not before Riding socks her own character-defining song --
''Waiting for the Music to Begin,'' with Jane finding a very
playable instrument in the libidinous Darryl -- out of the theater.
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey and Dana P. Rowe's score is at its brassiest and best
asserting the women's needs. It is considerably less good when it
puts center-stage McShane -- a star who has to carry two second-act
company numbers that mostly make you cringe.
</P>
<P>
   That's too bad. Because, when he's not attempting to sing or
dance, McShane cuts an attractive roue who matches up perfectly to
the ''bearish, dark man'' described in Updike's novel. He's far
less hammy, too, than Nicholson, which isn't saying much, though it
anchors the show in a way unavailable to the movie's over-the-top
star turn.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, it remains ladies' night throughout.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Witches of Eastwick'' can be said to dispatch its male
anti-hero in more ways than one. ''Look at Me,'' sing the women in
the final number, as they advance upon an audience that for much of
the show would find it hard to look anywhere else.

<HEADLINE> Compromise Sought on Marriage Tax  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House and Senate negotiators hope to resolve
differences quickly between competing bills to cut income taxes for
millions of married couples as Republicans rush to force President
Clinton to veto or sign the measure prior to the national GOP
convention.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders say a veto of the ''marriage penalty'' bill could
put the president and Vice President Al Gore in a tough political
spot, since both have recommended its elimination as long as the
tax cuts are less costly and targeted toward middle- and
lower-income couples.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be very hard to explain,'' Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said. ''Mr. President, are you for
eliminating the marriage penalty tax or not?''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed its version of the bill Tuesday on a 61-38
vote, brushing aside the veto threat and Democratic criticism that
the legislation is skewed to the wealthy. Eight Democrats joined
most Republicans in favor of the 10-year, $248 billion tax cut, but
the margin was not veto-proof.
</P>
<P>
   The House already has passed a bill to cut married couples'
taxes by $182 billion over 10 years, which differs somewhat from
the Senate bill. A House-Senate conference committee will work out
the differences, and GOP leaders intend to finish by week's end.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and Lott met Wednesday in
an effort to reach a quick agreement amid some signs that
Republicans could moderate the bill's cost in a bid to win
Clinton's support and get a concrete accomplishment for voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to get something on his desk that's signable,'' Hastert
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Tuesday, Clinton repeated his offer to sign the
GOP marriage penalty bill only if Congress also sends him a measure
creating an acceptable Medicare prescription drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the best way to break the partisan logjam and help the
tens of millions of older Americans across this country who face
rising prescription drug costs,'' the president said. ''By itself,
I would veto this bill.''
</P>
<P>
   To draw a distinction between the GOP and Democrats on the tax
issue, Republicans want to get the stand-alone bill to Clinton
before their Philadelphia convention begins July 31. Republicans
also will hold back until September a bill passed last week to
repeal estate taxes so the issues don't get muddied for the public.
</P>
<P>
   Gleeful GOP supporters pointed to new Congressional Budget
Office projections of an enormous $2.17 trillion surplus over the
next decade as evidence of the need to cut taxes as well as pay
down the public debt.
</P>
<P>
   The administration, said House Budget Committee Chairman John
Kasich, R-Ohio, ''is officially out of excuses for not accepting
tax fairness. These growing surpluses must be applied to debt
reduction and tax relief.''
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders want to use a portion of the estimated $102 billion
surplus in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1 to permit people to
benefit in that year from some of the ''marriage penalty'' cut. The
Senate bill delays some key provisions until 2002 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Republicans plan to push for more tax cuts in this
election year, including a proposed expansion in tax-deferred
contributions to retirement accounts and repeal of a 1993 tax
increase imposed on the Social Security benefits of people with
incomes above certain levels.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate-passed ''marriage penalty'' bill would cut taxes for
approximately 45 million couples, including about 25 million
two-earner households in which couples pay more than they would if
single. It also would cut taxes for millions of other couples who
receive a marriage ''bonus'' because one spouse earns considerably
more than the other.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would:
</P>
<P>
   --Gradually enlarge the 15 percent and 28 percent income tax
brackets for married couples so they are roughly twice the size of
those for single people. The House bill widens only the 15 percent
bracket.
</P>
<P>
   --In 2001, boost a couple's standard income tax deduction so it
is equal to those of two single people. In 2000 dollars, that's an
increase from $7,350 to $8,800. The House bill is the same.
</P>
<P>
   --Raise by $2,500 the income cap for couples who want to claim
the earned income tax credit. The House bill raises the threshold
by $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   --Ensure that certain personal credits, including the
$500-per-child tax credit, don't ensnare taxpayers in the complex
alternative minimum tax. House treatment is somewhat better.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats heaped scorn on the Republican drive for tax cuts,
saying they risk squandering the surplus to benefit primarily
upper-income people while ignoring such spending priorities as
providing prescription drugs under Medicare and smaller classroom
sizes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very clear that the Republicans in Congress have decided
to put aside their responsibilities and to play politics,'' said
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Citing research from the labor-funded Citizens for Tax Justice,
Democrats said almost 58 percent of major GOP tax cuts passed or
pending this year would go to families with incomes in the top 5
percent, over $130,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are more interested in taking care of their wealthy
friends than working families,'' said House Minority Leader Dick
Gephardt, D-Mo. ''I don't think the American people are dumb. They
don't want the (surplus) money to go to tax cuts for the wealthy.''
</P>

<HEADLINE> Kennedy Center Names New Chief  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Michael Kaiser, who once wanted to be an opera
singer but is now known for helping opera and ballet institutions
rebuild their finances, has been named the new head of the Kennedy
Center, Washington's multiple stage for music and plays of all
kinds.
</P>
<P>
   His last rescue job was London's troubled Royal Opera House --
Covent Garden -- where he worked off a deficit and created an
endowment. The Kennedy Center is in a drive for $100 million, of
which $70 million already has been raised.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser resigned from the Royal Opera House a month ago after 19
months on the job. Previously, he headed the American Ballet
Theatre, where he erased the entire accumulated deficit and
increased income substantially.
</P>
<P>
   An American who began as an aspiring opera singer, Kaiser has
had experience with the Washington Opera, which performs at the
Kennedy Center, the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and the
State Ballet of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am honored to be asked to take this leadership and look
forward to working with the artists, staff and trustees of the
Kennedy Center to build the local, national and international
contributions of this remarkable institution,'' Kaiser said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser, 47, will replace Lawrence J. Wilker, who announced his
departure in April. Kaiser will start Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''The news of Michael Kaiser's appointment is indeed exciting,''
Washington Opera Artistic Director Placido Domingo told The
Washington Post in a statement. ''He brings with him such an
impressive track record of giving extraordinary stability to arts
organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   A native of New York City, Kaiser studied violin and trained as
an opera baritone, performing in the chorus at Tanglewood.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy Center, which also puts on concerts, plays, musicals
and films, is in the midst of a $170 million renovation program.
Basic improvements are being made to the center's Opera House,
which may become the permanent home of the Washington Opera.

<HEADLINE> Frampton Puts Family Before Rock  </HEADLINE>
By JIM PATTERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Peter Frampton had a schedule conflict
that could only happen to a rock star of a certain vintage: Ringo
Starr was in town and wanted to jam on the day Frampton's daughter
was graduating from high school.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now, the show was from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m.,'' said Frampton in a
proper British accent despite living 20 years in the United States.
''The (graduation) dinner was from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. Now, what am I
going to go to?''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it wasn't much of a conflict for Frampton, who has
toured with Ringo's All-Starr Band.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, Ringo will play again. ... But there's only one
graduation. Next year, my other daughter is going to be graduating,
so I won't be playing that night, either,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 25 years ago, Frampton fretted about ''Lines on My
Face,'' one of the songs on his ''Frampton Comes Alive!'' album.
Now time has left its inevitable mark. Although he still wears
leather pants, the long flowing hair is gone, replaced by a short,
cropped haircut. However, on occasion, he puts on a wig that makes
him look like the Peter Frampton of old.
</P>
<P>
   ''I come out for the encore with the wig and some shiny pants
and a shirt that's open. It's like another guy came up on stage,''
he said. ''A million flashes went off at once.''
</P>
<P>
   Frampton has tasted superstardom. He was named Rolling Stone
magazine's ''Artist of the Year'' following the release of
''Frampton Comes Alive!'' in 1976. The resulting publicity and tour
launched the singles ''Baby I Love Your Way,'' ''Show Me the Way''
and ''Do You Feel Like We Do?''
</P>
<P>
   Today, family, not career, takes priority. Frampton and his wife
Tina have three daughters and a son. The family recently moved to
the Cincinnati area to be closer to his wife's family, but Frampton
said he considers Nashville his ''musical home.''
</P>
<P>
   At 50, Frampton is still a popular concert attraction. When he's
not touring, he keeps busy on a variety of projects, including work
as a technical adviser on a film about '70s rock 'n' roll and
writing music for a roller-coaster ride in Sandusky, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The film is Cameron Crowe's ''Almost Famous,'' starring Jason
Lee, Billy Crudup, Kate Hudson, Frances McDormand and Anna Paquin.
Frampton wrote two songs and has a cameo in the film, which is
scheduled for release this fall.
</P>
<P>
   He is also supervising the reissue of his catalog of albums,
including ''Frampton Comes Alive!'' in a 25th anniversary edition.
An appearance on VH1's ''Behind the Music'' will air this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''Live in Detroit,'' his third live album, was recently
released. It showcases his underrated guitar skills and includes
old favorites ''Show Me the Way'' and ''Do You Feel Like We Do?''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very hard when someone hands you ANOTHER live album of
Peter Frampton and you go, 'Why is he doing this?''' Frampton said
in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The answer: ''Live in Detroit'' was conceived as a digital video
disc, and CMC International asked him to do a companion CD.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think of it as the DVD project, which has a lot of
validity,'' he said, ''because it is the first thing out there
visual, as well as audio, and it contains the highest quality
sound.''
</P>
<P>
   During the show recorded for DVD at the Pine Knob Music Theatre
in Michigan, Frampton asked the audience to be enthusiastic about a
new song. In return, he promised to play his old hits.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just the nature of the beast,'' he said. ''The heart
grows fonder the longer those hits become these chestnuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Frampton occasionally sits in with David Letterman's ''Late
Show'' band. He was there during a show that included a performance
by the Foo Fighters.
</P>
<P>
   ''They came and they'd learnt 'Show Me the Way' so that they
could play it with me going into the commercial,'' he said. ''The
audience and David Letterman went nuts. Foo Fighters and Peter
Frampton -- Foo Frampton. It was wonderful.''

<HEADLINE> Bon Jovi Rocks on With New Album  </HEADLINE>
By GERARD O'LEARY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Relaxing in his luxury Manhattan apartment with
its magnificent view of his native New Jersey, Jon Bon Jovi is
feeling happy.
</P>
<P>
   His band's new album ''Crush'' (Island) recently debuted in the
top 10, and he has received good reviews for his role in the
submarine thriller ''U-571.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a happiness he didn't know earlier in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ''The success happened so fast, I didn't really get a chance to
enjoy myself,'' Bon Jovi, 38, said. ''It was nonstop touring for
four years straight, with not much rest. My voice was strained and
my body constantly ached. ... I guess everything hit me way too
fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he is pacing his life and enjoying his success.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we hit the road this tour, it won't be a long drawn-out
thing. We'll play a gig, take two days off and play again,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the band is busy promoting the new album, Bon Jovi said
the group no longer has anything to prove. ''We established this
band by selling 80 million records. Now we can sit back and let the
music take care of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Bon Jovi, the quintessential '80s pop-metal band, combines the
power-chord driven guitars of hard rock with the working-class
sensibilities of Bruce Springsteen. This combination propelled
''Slippery When Wet'' (1986) and ''New Jersey'' (1988) into
multiplatinum status. Both albums were criticized for having more
pop than metal and for targeting an audience of teen-age girls. Yet
Bon Jovi managed to move away from metal and concentrate on
straightforward rock and big ballads. In the process, the band has
retained a sizable audience.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is just a simple rock 'n' roll band,'' Bon Jovi said.
''It's definitely not metal nor is it pop. We were classified metal
because of the bands we played with. But I was never influenced by
Kiss, Judas Priest or the Scorpions.''
</P>
<P>
   The new album has many flavors. The opening track ''It's My
Life'' is a classic Bon Jovi song with a great hook. The next
track, ''Say It Isn't So,'' has more of a Beatles flavor to it,
something a hard-core Bon Jovi fan might not appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wrote 60 songs for this album and wanted it to be very
diversified,'' said Bon Jovi. ''We picked songs to give the album a
beginning, middle and an end, and we hope that's what the listener
will get from it.''
</P>
<P>
   And it wouldn't be a Bon Jovi album without a ballad and the
song ''Thank You for Loving Me.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The catalyst for the song was the movie 'Meet Joe Black,'''
the singer explained. ''Brad Pitt played the Grim Reaper, and at
the end of the movie, he grabs this beautiful girl. As he leaves he
says, 'Thank you for loving me.' And I thought, 'What a courageous
thing to say to someone.' It's easy to say I love you, but more
meaningful to thank someone for loving you.''
</P>
<P>
   Bon Jovi's interest in films began in the early '90s when he
wrote the soundtrack for ''Young Guns II.'' Then he caught the
acting bug. He received favorable reviews for his roles in
''Moonlight and Valentino'' and ''The Leading Man.'' He has a role
in the new Kevin Spacey film ''Pay It Forward,'' which is scheduled
for release later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Critics love the work I've done in movies, but I haven't made
any real money yet,'' he said. ''When I sell 80 million records,
the critics hate it. ... I don't know if I wanna be the Elvis
Costello of the movie business or the Tom Cruise of the music
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Given a choice, Bon Jovi would rather win an Oscar than a
Grammy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Rolling Stones didn't win their Grammy until 30 years
after all the great music they made,'' he said. ''That to me is a
joke.''
</P>
<P>
   His loyalty to friends, family and bandmates is remarkable. He
is still married to his high school sweetheart. Three of the other
four original Bon Jovi members are still with the band: Richie
Sambora (guitar), Tico Torres (drums) and David Bryan (keyboards).
And although bassist Alec John Such left because of the stress of
touring, he is still considered part of the group.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I start something, I like to finish it,'' Bon Jovi
explained. ''In my heart, Alec will always be a part of this band.
Hugh (McDonald) ... has done a fantastic job filling his shoes. ...
But I'm a loyal guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The band, currently on tour in Japan, will start a U.S. tour
this fall.

   Make no mistake: Rubenstein takes these issues very seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's all relative,'' she said in an interview at her office.
''For a 16-year-old girl, the main things are friends, the guy she
likes, parents. We dissect these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubenstein, 28, grew up on nearby Long Island after her family
left Iran in 1975. She says that when she was a teen, ''none of the
boys liked me. I had bad skin and frizzy hair.'' Now, she looks
back on those years to help her be a ''big sister'' to her readers,
who range in age from 12 to 17.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know how much a kind word can inspire a girl. That has
really propelled me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Barnard College in New York, Rubenstein
was hired as a fashion assistant at Cosmopolitan magazine under
renowned editor-in-chief Helen Gurley Brown. During the next five
years, she worked her way up to senior fashion editor, then moved
to spinoff CosmoGIRL!, which celebrates its first birthday in
August.
</P>
<P>
   Was she afraid that Cosmo's racy reputation would hurt a
magazine designed for teen-age girls?
</P>
<P>
   ''I got mail from some parents who bought the magazine before
they gave it to their daughter, to see what it was like,'' she
said. ''And they approved.''
</P>
<P>
   1. You read magazines when you were younger. What are some of
the differences between girls then and CosmoGIRL! readers?
</P>
<P>
   Rubenstein: I grew up looking at magazines with unrealistic
expectations, in ways that made me think that I wasn't normal. I
thought about why there was no diversity in magazines. I looked at
the prices of clothes in magazines and I felt like I was poor. But
I wasn't poor. No one buys $200 dresses when they're 15! Today, I
think these girls know they're important, they know they're being
marketed to, but they won't be dictated to.
</P>
<P>
   2. How do you stay in the mind set of a teen-ager?
</P>
<P>
   Rubenstein: I can almost feel the way it felt walking down the
hall in school, when boys were still uncharted territory. I have
access to that place in my mind. Also, I read every letter. It
reminds me of their voices. I can't tell you how many times I've
gotten e-mails from readers, even mothers and fathers, saying thank
you. Girls will say, 'You really helped me' or 'Do you know the
place you brought me back from?' Sometimes I'll get an e-mail at 2
in the morning and it will just say, 'Are you there?' because they
know, sometimes I am there.
</P>
<P>
   3. Do you get respect in the publishing industry despite your
young age?
</P>
<P>
   Rubenstein: I really credit the people who support me. People
have been so fabulous and amazing. I get tremendous support.
Sometimes they laugh at me, like when I say, 'Ten years ago, when I
was a teen-ager.' ... But in fashion, it's important to have
younger people at the helm of new ideas. We think differently.
</P>
<P>
   4. Teen-age girls are very impressionable. Do you feel any
pressure putting out a magazine that targets these girls?
</P>
<P>
   Rubenstein: I don't feel pressure. I feel responsibility. I
don't just see this as a vehicle to show the latest fashions or
bands. We feel the most important issue is a girl's relationship to
herself. We have a section called 'The Inner Girl' where it all
comes back to her self-esteem. I see CosmoGIRL! as more than a
magazine. It's a way to help girls.
</P>
<P>
   5. You have accomplished so much at such a young age. What do
you see in your future?
</P>
<P>
   Rubenstein: We have this baby and I don't see past her. We
haven't even started yet.

<HEADLINE> Nickel Creek Reinvents Bluegrass  </HEADLINE>
By JIM PATTERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Chris Thile grimaces as he remembers the
reaction when pop band Hootie &AMP; the Blowfish turned up at a big
bluegrass festival.
</P>
<P>
   ''They came to Merlefest, which is the biggest bluegrass
festival in the world,'' Thile said. ''These people started
complaining!
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going, 'That's going to bring ... maybe 20,000 people that
would never have come to this thing if it weren't for Hootie being
there.''
</P>
<P>
   He shakes his head. At 19, Thile (pronounced THEEL-ee) is a
world-class mandolin player and leader of Nickel Creek, a youthful
bluegrass band with big aspirations. Together with Sara Watkins,19,
and her 23-year-old brother Sean Watkins, Nickel Creek is melding a
unique sound that begins with Bill Monroe, but is also inspired by
classical music and pop-rock bands Toad the Wet Sprocket and Ben
Folds Five.
</P>
<P>
   Sean plays guitar and writes many of Nickel Creek's songs, as
does Thile. Sara plays fiddle. Bassist Byron House is touring with
the group this summer in place of Thile's father Scott Thile, who
recently left the group.
</P>
<P>
   The publication Bluegrass Now has called the band innovative,
cutting-edge, intricate and polished. Last year, Nickel Creek was
nominated as Emerging Artist of the year by the International
Bluegrass Music Association. The band has performed at major folk
and bluegrass festivals across the United States and in Japan and
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ''We love playing for everybody, but we especially feel good
about getting young people,'' Thile said. ''Because you turn on the
radio and you hear (Britney Spears') 'Hit Me Baby One More Time.'
</P>
<P>
   ''I think people sometimes have a hard time getting into
bluegrass because it seems a little bit uptight. Even though the
music is really cool and fast and technical, sometimes it can seem
a little stiff to young people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Watkins finishes the thought: ''Plus, it's still associated
with that image. Of straw and rocking chairs on porches. ... We're
not the classic stereotype of a bluegrass band. The image is
different. We're surfers.''
</P>
<P>
   Nickel Creek recently made its debut on Sugar Hill Records. The
self-titled CD features the ethereal vocals of Thile and Ms.
Watkins, with instrumentals evoking everything from a butterfly to
''Lord of the Rings'' and Robin Hood. The CD was produced by
bluegrass crossover artist Alison Krauss and follows her lead into
a new kind of haunting, sophisticated acoustic pop music.
</P>
<P>
   The band members became friends in elementary school in San
Diego. They got together to play in a contest, releasing their
first CD in 1991 and winning a regional contest in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ''We played bluegrass and cowboy music,'' Thile said.
</P>
<P>
   The mention of Nickel Creek's cowboy phase brought hoots and
groans from the Watkins siblings.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a CD from that time, so it's kind of hard to forget,''
Thile said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've all always been influenced by the same music at the same
time,'' Ms. Watkins said. ''There was the cowboy thing, and we all
went through this little Celtic phase.''
</P>
<P>
   Thile has two solo instrumental albums to his credit. All three
performers are multiple award winners at bluegrass festivals.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins is now writing more pop-oriented material, similar to
Counting Crows, he said, but ''not quite as depressing.''
</P>
<P>
   They all believe that bluegrass musicians are on the verge of
expanding their audience dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   ''If everyone plays it right, if everyone does their part, I
think that the audience could expand immensely,'' Thile said. ''For
one thing, everybody would really have to open their minds to
change in the music. ... It always needs to be free to grow.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Falls 35; Nasdaq Sheds 90  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices fell Wednesday, as disappointed
investors vented their wrath on a slew of technology companies
whose second-quarter financial results failed to live up to
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 35.35 at 10,704.57.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was down 11.60 at 1,482.14, and the Nasdaq composite
index was down 90.10 at 4,087.07.
</P>
<P>
   The falloff in blue-chip stocks came despite a positive earnings
reports from Citigroup, the largest U.S. financial services
company, which said its profits rose 23 percent over the same
period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup's stock rose 75 cents to $67.438.
</P>
<P>
   But on the Nasdaq investors are showing they are fed up with
Internet companies whose losses continue to grow. For example,
Veritas Software Corp. shares fell $13.50 to $114.063 after the
maker of data storage-management software said its second-quarter
losses were greater than a year ago, widening to $172.3 million
from $162.3 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   And Commerce One's stock was down $7.875 to $58.688 after the
e-commerce software company said its second-quarter losses widened
to 28 cents a share from 11 cents in the year-earlier quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also fell, dipping $5 to $73.50. The software maker
reported better than expected fiscal second-quarter earnings. But
sales were stagnant, about equal to the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the Super Bowl syndrome. The reality never lives up to
the hype,'' said John Eade, director of research at Argus Research
in New York. ''The Nasdaq rallied last week ahead of earnings, but
now that companies are reporting, investors are taking some
profits.''
</P>
<P>
   The downturn on the Nasdaq extended a selloff that began
Tuesday, which occurred despite encouraging news on inflation. The
Labor Department reported that consumer inflation -- excluding
skyrocketing fuel costs -- had risen just 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said it's anyone's guess as to whether the Federal
Reserve Board will raise interest rates or leave them stable at its
next meeting Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Investors across both the stock and bond markets have been
anxiously awaiting testimony Thursday by Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan before a Senate committee. Many investors have
chosen to remain on the sidelines until Greenspan's testimony is
over, a decision that has led to listless trading and a market with
no clear direction.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 418.46 million
shares, down from Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 6.76 at 529.52.

<HEADLINE> Bush To Attend Coverdell Service  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate George W.
Bush plans to attend a Saturday service for the late Sen. Paul
Coverdell in Atlanta, the Texas governor's campaign said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and Al Gore, his Democratic opponent, paid tribute to
the late Georgia senator on Tuesday after he died of a stroke a day
after suffering a cerebral hemorrhages
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell, 61, was a close family friend and Senate liaison to
Bush. And he was a colleague to Gore, who as vice president serves
as president of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell served as Peace Corps director in the administration
of former President Bush and on his presidential campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ''Paul's death is a huge loss to his family, his friends, his
constituents in Georgia and our country,'' Bush said in a statement
on Tuesday. ''Paul was a great friend to Laura and me and we shared
family and political ties for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   At a campaign stop in Kansas City, Mo., Gore cited his
constitutional role as president of the Senate as he opened the
campaign rally with a moment of silence for Coverdell.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a partisan gathering, but we are all Americans,'' Gore
said, ''and when something like this happens we join together in
thinking of the family and thinking of our country and honoring the
service of an individual who helped to make our constitution work
and served in a distinguished way.''

<HEADLINE> Broadway Producer Merrick Honored  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The late Broadway producer David Merrick liked
to terrorize theater critics. Take it from Clive Barnes, theater
critic.
</P>
<P>
   That way, Merrick could believe poor reviews were spite and good
ones were the result of his handiwork, said Barnes, who writes for
the New York Post.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes and others gathered this week for a memorial service on
the stage of the St. James Theater, where Merrick's ''Hello,
Dolly!'' ran for years and his ''42nd Street'' finished its long
Broadway run.
</P>
<P>
   Zack Manna, executive director of the David Merrick Arts
Foundation, said Merrick ''was the last of the great American
showmen, respected, feared, admired and hated but never ignored. He
was no saint and he worked hard making sure people understood
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrick produced many successes between 1944 and 1996, including
''The Matchmaker,'' ''Gypsy,'' ''Carnival,'' ''Stop the World -- I
Want To Get Off!'' and ''Oliver!'' He also produced authors
Tennessee Williams, John Osborne, Brian Friel and Tom Stoppard when
others wouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Kissel of the Daily News, author of a Merrick biography,
said Merrick ''timed'' his April 25 death at age 88 well: A few
days earlier, Broadway producer rival Alexander Cohen died, and his
obituary ran on a Saturday. Merrick's ran in better-read midweek
editions, and on Page 1.

<HEADLINE> Singer Shirley Bassey Made a Dame  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Even after a 45-year career, singer Shirley Bassey
is not immune to stage fright, and she got a bad case of
butterflies Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't at a concert. She was made a dame by Queen Elizabeth
II.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am shaking more now than I was before,'' said Bassey, 63,
after the ceremony at Buckingham Palace. ''I have got a lump in my
throat and I am nearly in tears.''
</P>
<P>
   Bassey, best-known for crooning the sultry theme song to the
1964 James Bond film ''Goldfinger,'' began her career singing in
Welsh workingmen's clubs and went on to score 10 British top-10
hits.
</P>
<P>
   British fans regard her as a national institution, and some
lined up outside the palace with banners proclaiming
''Congratulations, Dame Shirley.''

   ''Every bowl of shark fin soup involves killing an animal. Shark
fins don't grow back,'' said Peter Benchley, who is touring Asia to

<HEADLINE> Israel: Barak May Leave Peace Talks  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA KING
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- As President Clinton struggled to salvage
faltering Mideast peace talks, Israel Prime Minister Ehud Barak was
reported to have sent a letter to his summit host complaining that
the Palestinians were not negotiating in good faith.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Palestinians arrived at Camp David lacking a true
commitment, and are not ready to have a substantive discussion
about a lasting peace and to make historic decisions,'' Israel
radio quoted a Hebrew translation of the letter as saying. ''Unless
there are last-minute changes, the Palestinians will have to
envision the tragic consequences of an opportunity they missed.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman P.J. Crowley said Clinton had received a
letter from Barak but he declined to discuss its contents. Israeli
officials, observing a news blackout, said they could not get into
the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton sent the summit into overtime when he delayed a trip to
Japan for a day.
</P>
<P>
   As the president met Wednesday morning with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat -- their second talk in 12 hours -- Israel said ''it
seems'' that Barak had decided to stop the talks and return home.
But the White House said it had not been informed about anyone
planning to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a lot of stuff that flies around the air that's not
worth a lot ... but just has no reflection of what's going on,''
presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart said at the midpoint of the
talks' ninth day.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining Clinton's decision to delay his trip, Lockhart said,
''It's a judgment that the president made that it was useful and in
the interests of the peace process to do that, but it's not an
open-ended commitment.'' He said the president planned to get on
Air Force One sometime overnight and fly to Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ''The parties know what they have to do,'' the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met with Barak around 10 p.m. Tuesday and then talked
with Arafat. The president finished work about 1 a.m. and returned
to work Wednesday eight hours later, meeting first with members of
the U.S. negotiating team and then again with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if it had been worthwhile for Clinton to remain at the
talks, Lockhart said, ''I think that the fact that he's sitting in
at a bilateral (meeting) with Chairman Arafat as we speak indicates
that we think it's worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli statement, issued by telephone by the prime
minister's office in response to a reporter's question and
attributed to senior sources, did not specify when the Israeli team
planned to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems that Barak has decided to stop the talks and return
to Israel,'' it said, adding that the Palestinians were unprepared
to take the steps necessary to bring about an accord.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Israel's deputy defense minister, Ephraim Sneh, told
reporters the picture at Camp David was ''quite gloomy.'' But he
added that ''as long as he (Barak), the host and the other party is
there, there is maybe a glimmer of hope.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House had announced after midnight that Clinton was
putting off his departure for a summit of industrial powers ''in
the best interests of the Middle East peace process.'' He had been
scheduled to depart Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly, the president is doing this so he can continue to
work with the leaders through Wednesday,'' Crowley said then.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the flap erupted over whether anyone was leaving,
indications were that the going was extremely difficult at Camp
David.
</P>
<P>
   Ofir Pines, an Israeli lawmaker and chairman of Barak's
governing coalition, said he did not believe the two sides could
reach an accord.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Palestinian Authority is not prepared, simply is not
prepared to reach an understanding to reach a peace agreement with
Israel,'' he said on Israel radio Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians, though, blamed Israel for the impasse.
</P>
<P>
   ''There can be no agreement without total Palestinian
sovereignty over east Jerusalem,'' said Hassan Abdel Rahman, the
Washington envoy of Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization.
''This is a basic condition for achieving peace.''
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank, about Palestinians rallied in the town of
Ramallah, waving banners, Palestinian flags and keys made out of
cardboard, to symbolize lost homes inside Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''No peace without Jerusalem!'' some shouted. ''Return of the
refugees!''
</P>
<P>
   Since the summit began July 11, Clinton has been shuttling
between the two sides, trying to shepherd them toward an accord on
the most painful and divisive issues: the boundaries of a future
Palestinian state, the fate of several million Palestinian refugees
and -- most explosive of all -- the status of Jerusalem, which both
sides claim as their capital.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton leaves Thursday morning as now scheduled, he would
still arrive in time for the Friday-Sunday meeting in Japan's
southernmost province, Okinawa, skipping preliminary talks in
Tokyo. The White House statement expressed ''regrets'' over the
delay.
</P>
<P>
   In Tokyo, Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori's spokesman Kazuhiko
Koshikawa said, ''We understand the circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than an absence of about eight hours on Thursday, Clinton
has been at Camp David throughout the talks, leading a marathon
drive for an accord.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices fell Wednesday, as disappointed
investors vented their wrath on a slew of technology companies
whose second-quarter financial results fell short of expectations.
</P>
<P>
   In midafternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 2.33 at 10,722.57.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was down 7.39 at 1,486.35, and the Nasdaq composite index
was down 77.69 at 4,099.48.
</P>
<P>
   The falloff in blue-chip stocks came despite a positive earnings
reports from Citigroup, the largest U.S. financial services
company, which said its profits rose 23 percent over the same
period a year ago. Citigroup's stock rose $1.0625 to $67.75.
</P>
<P>
   But on the Nasdaq investors are showing they are fed up with
Internet companies whose losses continue to grow. For example,
Veritas Software Corp. shares fell $14.875 to $112.688 after the
maker of data storage-management software said its second-quarter
losses were greater than a year ago, widening to $172.3 million
from $162.3 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   And Commerce One's stock was down $8.063 to $58.50 after the
e-commerce software company said its second-quarter losses widened
to 28 cents a share from 11 cents in the year-earlier quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also fell, dipping $5 to $73.50. The software maker
reported better than expected fiscal second-quarter earnings. But
sales were stagnant, about equal to the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the Super Bowl syndrome. The reality never lives up to
the hype,'' said John Eade, director of research at Argus Research
in New York. ''The Nasdaq rallied last week ahead of earnings, but
now that companies are reporting, investors are taking some
profits.''
</P>
<P>
   The downturn on the Nasdaq extended a selloff that began
Tuesday, which occurred despite encouraging news on inflation. The
Labor Department reported that consumer inflation -- excluding
skyrocketing fuel costs -- had risen just 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said it's anyone's guess as to whether the Federal
Reserve Board will raise interest rates or leave them stable at its
next meeting Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Investors across both the stock and bond markets have been
anxiously awaiting testimony Thursday by Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan before a Senate committee. Many investors have
chosen to remain on the sidelines until Greenspan's testimony is
over, a decision that has led to listless trading and a market with
no clear direction.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 612.70 million
shares, down from Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 5.90 at 530.38.

<HEADLINE> CBS Expanding 'Big Brother'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Five nights a week apparently isn't enough for
CBS's ''Big Brother.'' The network is adding a sixth night.
</P>
<P>
   Starting next week, an hourlong live edition of ''Big Brother''
will air on Wednesdays at 9 p.m. EDT. Wednesdays and Sundays were
the only two nights when the show wasn't on the CBS schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The move gives CBS a chance, for five weeks, to pair its summer
hit, ''Survivor,'' with what is usually the climactic event of the
''Big Brother'' week.
</P>
<P>
   CBS had picked Thursdays for the weekly show in which one of the
10 strangers rooming together in a California house gets booted
out. Every other Thursday, the contestants nominate two people to
leave. Viewers choose between the two and, on the other Thursday,
the votes are tabulated and the loser leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday will become banishment day starting next week. CBS
will still air a half-hour version of ''Big Brother'' on Thursdays.
</P>
<P>
   The show has drawn mediocre ratings and, so far, hasn't
captivated nearly as many viewers as ''Survivor.'' But it has been
a winner among the 18-to-34-year-old audience that CBS normally has
trouble reaching.
</P>
<P>
   The highest ratings by far for ''Big Brother'' came when it
debuted July 5 immediately following ''Survivor.'' CBS obviously
hopes that using the plum time slot will help drum up greater
interest in ''Big Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It obviously makes for a better flow,'' CBS spokesman Chris
Ender said.
</P>
<P>
   One extra edition a week won't change the length of the series'
run, he said. ''Big Brother'' will continue airing until late
September, when the audience chooses its favorite contestant to win
a $500,000 prize.

<HEADLINE> Regis To Pay Property Tax Bill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The city of Stamford has a question for
Regis Philbin, and it's not multiple choice: Will you pay your tax
bill? Philbin's final answer: No problem.
</P>
<P>
   The host of ABC's ''Who Wants to be a Millionaire'' owes the
city $138.20 in property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Philbin's 5.68 acre estate lies mainly in Greenwich, but a third
of an acre is across the city line in Stamford.
</P>
<P>
   Hope Hartman, a spokeswoman for Philbin at ABC, said Philbin
thought the Greenwich tax bill covered both cities. Philbin, who
also hosts ''Regis and Kathie Lee Live,'' will resolve the matter
as quickly as possible, she said.

<HEADLINE> Nugent Pulls Out of Houston Concert  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Ted Nugent would rather silence his guitar than
his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Citing freedom of speech, the rocker is pulling out of an Aug.
22 concert with Kiss because the promoters want him to promise not
to make offensive remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Nugent raised the ire of Latinos at an April concert here when
he criticized people who live in the United States but don't speak
English and told them to return to their native countries. The
profanity-laced tirade echoed similar comments at San Antonio
concert a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Local Hispanic community leaders are organizing a national
boycott of Nugent.
</P>
<P>
   ''We respect freedom of speech but we objected to the demeaning
manner in which he said his remarks and the effect it has on
immigrant bashing,'' said Johnny Mata of the League of United Latin
American Citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ''He needs to learn by being hit in the pocket book,'' Mata
said.

<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- The Paris Metro celebrated its 100th birthday
Wednesday, with travelers hearing a recorded announcement detailing
the highlights of the underground system that now allows people to
cross the French capital in 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, about 4 million commuters take the metro, which has 14
lines in addition to high-speed suburban service.
</P>
<P>
   The metro's first line went into service July 19, 1900,
connecting the Porte Maillot in the west with the Porte de
Vincennes in the east. It is still one of the city's busiest lines,
with stops at the Arc de Triomphe, the Place de la Concorde and the
Louvre Museum.
</P>
<P>
   The Paris Metro is considered one of the world's most efficient.
It is reliable and inexpensive, with a book of 10 tickets costing
58 francs ($8.28).
</P>
<P>
   Nine stations are celebrating the 100th anniversary with special
displays, but no major ceremonies were held.

<HEADLINE> British Police Detonate Subway Bomb  </HEADLINE>
By KRISTIN GAZLAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A subway station bomb believed to have been
planted by a dissident Irish group reduced key sections of London
to gridlock Wednesday and raised fears of renewed terrorist attacks
on the British mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Police safely detonated the device at west London's Ealing
Broadway Underground station after receiving a coded warning. The
warning used the same code name employed by a dissident group in
connection with the June 30 bombing of a Dublin-Belfast rail line,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Scotland Yard said early morning calls from Dublin also
contained threats on two key stations in central London,
Westminster and Victoria. Both were closed for hours as experts
searched unsuccessfully for explosives.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting chaos disrupted royal fans attending the 100th
birthday pageant for the Queen Mother Elizabeth and made getting
around the capital a nightmare for tens of thousands of commuters
and tourists. People throughout London had to coped with diverted
trains, closed stations and suspended services.
</P>
<P>
   ''As always, we are advising the public to remain on their
guard,'' said Alan Fry, deputy assistant commissioner of the
Metropolitan Police.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Ireland's police chief, Ronnie Flanagan, has warned
that splinter paramilitary groups opposed to the province's 1998
Good Friday peace accord are intent on carrying their campaign to
mainland Britain. Peter Mandelson, Britain's highest-ranking
official in Northern Ireland, told the House of Commons on
Wednesday that he would work closely with the Irish government to
combat the threat.
</P>
<P>
   ''The main paramilitary groups are maintaining their
cease-fires,'' Mandelson said. ''There remains, though, a threat
from dissident paramilitaries who are opposed to the Good Friday
agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a small bomb exploded on the Hammersmith Bridge over
the River Thames. The bridge remains closed.
</P>
<P>
   No one claimed responsibility, although authorities suspected
Irish terrorists. The Irish Republican Army, which has been
observing a cease-fire since 1997, planted two bombs on the
Hammersmith Bridge in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Kelly of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party -- once imprisoned
for bombing London's Old Bailey criminal courthouse -- said
Wednesday that any device planted in the British capital by
dissidents would clearly be an attempt to sabotage Northern
Ireland's peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only effective counter to such activities is to
demonstrate clearly and unambiguously that politics works,'' said
Kelly, now a member of the Northern Ireland Assembly set up as part
of the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the confusion Wednesday was a suspicious package near
Whitehall, the street stretching from Parliament to Trafalgar
squares, which contains a number of government offices. Scotland
Yard said another controlled explosion was carried out on the
package, which turned out to be merely an unattended bag.
</P>
<P>
   Whitehall is near the site where the pageant marking the Queen
Mother's upcoming birthday was held Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really sick that the terrorists are trying to spoil
everybody's day, but it's made us all the more determined to be
here -- it's a privilege,'' said Jill Charman, 62, who traveled to
London from Desborough, northwest of the capital, and ended up
walking the last short leg of the trip.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Doomsday Cult Leader Arrested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) -- Police arrested a cult leader who had
been on the run for 10 months after at least 24 decomposed bodies
were found buried in his camp, police said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson Bushara, 41, fled in September when police raided his
camp in Bokoto, 30 miles north of Kampala, and arrested 1,000
members of his World Message Last Warning cult.
</P>
<P>
   Bushara was arrested Monday with 29 followers in Iganga, 80
miles east of Kampala, police spokesman Asuman Mugenyi said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they don't believe Bushara's group is linked to the
Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God, a Ugandan doomsday cult
accused in the deaths of 778 members, 330 of whom were burned alive
in a March fire at their compound.
</P>
<P>
   Bushara began attracting crowds last year by offering them space
in heaven after death in return for cash. Men were supposed to
surrender their wives, and the wives declared themselves unmarried.
</P>
<P>
   Mugenyi said Wednesday that Bushara likely will be charged with
sexual abuse and managing unlawful assemblies.

<HEADLINE> Anti-SIDS Campaign Aimed at Blacks  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government launched a ''safe sleep''
campaign Wednesday to urge black parents to put babies to sleep on
their backs to reduce the high rate of sudden infant death syndrome
among black infants.
</P>
<P>
   Black babies are twice as likely to die from SIDS as other
babies, according to a 1998 study. The campaign seeks to break that
trend as well as baby care traditions -- now considered unsafe --
handed down from grandmother to mother to daughter. Ads on black
cable television and safety-oriented ''baby showers'' at community
health centers will highlight the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you have family tradition, the way it's always been done,
that's hard to counteract,'' said Ann Brown, head of the Consumer
Product Safety Commission, the agency spearheading the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Putting babies to sleep on their stomachs increases their risk
of SIDS, as does having quilts, comforters and pillows in cribs
with newborns. Kids can suffocate on soft bedding objects, which
may contribute to as many as 900 SIDS deaths a year.
</P>
<P>
   Other risk factors include smoking, mothers who are less than 20
years old at the time of their first pregnancy, lack of prenatal
care, and premature or low birth weight babies.
</P>
<P>
   A CPSC survey of 460 parents conducted showed that only 31
percent of blacks placed babies on their backs, considered the
safest position to guard against SIDS, compared to 43 percent of
all other parents.
</P>
<P>
   Black parents were more likely than other parents to place
children on their stomachs and sides and have pillows and other
soft bedding in cribs, the survey showed.
</P>
<P>
   SIDS is the name given for the sudden death of an infant under
one year of age that remains unexplained after a complete
investigation. It's the leading cause of death in infants between
one month and one year of age.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 the government and private groups launched a ''Back to
Sleep'' campaign to persuade parents to place children on their
backs. The effort has helped cut the SIDS rate by nearly 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, 2,529 babies died of SIDS, a rate of 64 deaths per
100,000 live births, according to the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention. For blacks, the number of SIDS deaths was 782, a
rate of 128 per 100,000 live births.
</P>
<P>
   Caya Lewis, national health coordinator at the NAACP, said
there's been a lack of prevention information targeted specifically
to blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Having materials that are geared specifically for
African-American communities is important,'' said Lewis. The NAACP
is working with black sororities to get the word out.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks tend to learn safe-baby practices from a grandmother,
mother or other family member who may still believe that it's safe
to put babies to sleep on their stomachs because that's what they
were taught. Forty percent of blacks in the survey said they didn't
place babies on their backs because of family tradition, compared
to 22 percent of all parents.
</P>
<P>
   Many poor blacks also lack access to health care, so they're not
seeing family doctors or nurses or visiting pediatricians' offices
where literature is available.
</P>
<P>
   In the new campaign, Black Entertainment Television will air
nationwide public service announcements during prime viewing times
and develop news stories about SIDS starting this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Three thousand government-funded health centers that serve
minorities will also distribute literature to patients and work
with state and local health departments.
</P>
<P>
   The CPSC campaign, funded by Gerber Products Co., recommended
several steps for babies under 12 months:
</P>
<P>
   --Place babies on their backs on firm, tight-fitting mattresses.
</P>
<P>
   --Remove all pillows, quilts, comforters and sheepskins from
cribs.
</P>
<P>
   --Consider using a sleeper as an alternative to blankets.
</P>
<P>
   --If using a blanket, use a thin one and tuck it around the
mattress so it reaches only as far as the baby's chest.
</P>
<P>
   --Make sure the baby's head remains uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   --Never put babies to sleep on a waterbed, sofa, soft mattress,
pillow or other soft surface.

<HEADLINE> Russia To Decide Czar's Sainthood  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW KRAMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- The Russian Orthodox Church decided Wednesday to
formally raise the question of canonizing Russia's last czar,
Nicholas II, and his family this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Holy Synod, the day-to-day ruling body of the church, voted
to recommend that the Archbishops' Council decide on the sainthood
issue when it meets in August, church spokesman Viktor Malukin
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This question will be discussed and decided,'' Malukin said.
</P>
<P>
   The synod recommended sainthood for Nicholas II, his wife
Alexandra, their son and four daughters -- all of whom were shot to
death by Communist guards July 17, 1918.
</P>
<P>
   Four servants who were also slain that night are not being
considered, Malukin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Holy Synod also recommended canonization of about 500 other
Russians who died for their faith in the 20th century, including
monks and priests executed by Soviet authorities, Malukin said.
</P>
<P>
   Many Orthodox believers already consider the czar a holy figure
representing all victims of Communism.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia, which split from the
Moscow-based church in the 1920s, already has canonized Nicholas
II.
</P>
<P>
   Some proponents of canonization say the czar and his family
deserve sainthood not for their actions in life -- historians say
Nicholas II was a clumsy, and sometimes cruel, leader -- but for
their deaths as martyrs at the hands of a Bolshevik firing squad.

<HEADLINE> Testimony at Woodward Au-Pair Trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHESTER, England (AP) -- British au pair Louise Woodward's father
refused to consider donating any leftover money from his daughter's
defense fund to charity or the church, a witness testified
Wednesday at the fraud trial of Woodward's parents.
</P>
<P>
   Don Sharp, the husband of Louise Woodward's former lawyer, said
Gary Woodward had told him angrily that ''no one was going to get
their hands on his ... money.''
</P>
<P>
   Louise Woodward was convicted in October 1997 by a Boston court
of murdering 8-month-old Matthew Eappen, who was in her care. A
judge later downgraded the conviction to manslaughter and she was
freed after serving 279 days in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Woodward and his estranged wife, Susan, are on trial on
charges of defrauding their daughter's defense fund of more than
$13,500.
</P>
<P>
   The Woodwards, both 44, deny fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp -- whose wife, Elaine Whitfield Sharp, represented Louise
Woodward during her trial -- said Gary Woodward's attitude ''was
plainly that that was Woodward family money.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He was upset that there was a suggestion that if there was any
money left after Louise's troubles were done, that the money might
be distributed to some sort of charitable organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The Woodwards are accused of submitting a false invoice to the
Louise Woodward and Family Trust stating that Whitfield Sharp had
charged Susan Woodward $2,200 a month for accommodation before the
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying for a third day Wednesday, Whitfield Sharp reiterated
her claim that the invoice was a forgery. ''I didn't charge them a
penny,'' she said. ''It is not my invoice.''
</P>
<P>
   The Woodward family, she said, had negotiated deals with
newspapers and planned to write a book about their saga even while
the trial was going on.
</P>
<P>
   She said she was told Louise ''intended to write a book and the
advance for that book would be $750,000 and she would never have to
work again.''
</P>
<P>
   She described the former au pair as ''problematic in many ways''
and ''duplicitous.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Woodward's lawyer, Donal McGuire, accused Whitfield Sharp
of having ''an unhealthy interest'' in the couple's trial, saying
she craved media attention and wanted to write a book herself on
the Louise Woodward case.
</P>
<P>
   ''You approached Louise Woodward,'' McGuire said. ''On a
separate occasion you approached Susan Woodward and asked if they
would sign a waiver ... that would enable you if such a waiver was
signed to write the definitive book about the Louise Woodward
case.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield Sharp denied the allegation. She also denied telling a
former Massachusetts state trooper who stopped her on suspicion of
drunk driving that she believed Louise Woodward was guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never said that about Louise to anybody,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The emotion-charged trial -- which had to break early for lunch
on Wednesday when Gary Woodward broke down in the dock -- is
expected to last three weeks.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices tumbled Wednesday, as disappointed
investors vented their wrath on a slew of technology companies
whose second-quarter financial results fell short of expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 43.84 at 10,696.08,
according to preliminary calculations.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was down 14.98 at 1,478.76, and the Nasdaq composite
index was down 123.77 at 4,053.40.
</P>
<P>
   The primary catalyst for the selloff was disappointing quarterly
results from two technology bellwethers -- Microsoft and Apple.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft fell $5.375 to $73.125 after the software giant
reported that second quarter sales were stagnant, about equal to
the same period a year ago. Earnings were up for the quarter, but
the increase was attributed to investment income rather than
profits from sales.
</P>
<P>
   Investors punished Apple after the computer maker beat Wall
Street's earnings expectations by a mere penny. Apple reported
second quarter profits of 45 cents a share. Wall Street had
predicted 44 cents. Apple's stock was off $4.562 at $52.688.
</P>
<P>
   The falloff in blue-chip stocks came despite a positive earnings
reports from Citigroup, the largest U.S. financial services
company, which said its profits rose 23 percent over the same
period a year ago. Citigroup's stock rose $1.187 to $67.875.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on the Nasdaq, investors began showing they are fed up
with Internet companies whose losses continue to grow. For example,
Veritas Software Corp. shares fell $15.313 to $112.25 after the
maker of data storage-management software said its second-quarter
losses were greater than a year ago, widening to $172.3 million
from $162.3 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   And Commerce One's stock was down $11.25 to $55.313 after the
e-commerce software company said its second-quarter losses widened
to 28 cents a share from 11 cents in the year-earlier quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the Super Bowl syndrome. The reality never lives up to
the hype,'' said John Eade, director of research at Argus Research
in New York. ''The Nasdaq rallied last week ahead of earnings, but
now that companies are reporting, investors are taking some
profits.''
</P>
<P>
   The downturn on the Nasdaq extended a selloff that began
Tuesday, which occurred despite encouraging news on inflation. The
Labor Department reported that consumer inflation -- excluding
skyrocketing fuel costs -- had risen just 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said it's anyone's guess as to whether the Federal
Reserve Board will raise interest rates or leave them stable at its
next meeting Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Investors across both the stock and bond markets have been
anxiously awaiting testimony Thursday by Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan before a Senate committee. Many investors have
chosen to remain on the sidelines until Greenspan's testimony is
over, a decision that has led to listless trading and a market with
no clear direction.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 902.75 million
shares, down from Tuesday's pace of 905.34 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 7.89 at 528.39.

<HEADLINE> New Mexican Pres Wants US Standards  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mexican President-elect Vicente Fox wants
Mexicans and Americans to be able to cross their common border
freely but only after a series of reforms bring his country's wages
to a level comparable to those of the United States, a top adviser
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Adolfo Aguilar Zinser, a Mexican senator and a key member of the
Fox team, said the president-elect expects to deal with the problem
of northbound migration through jobs programs, increased
educational opportunities and other initiatives. Some would involve
assistance from the United States, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox expects that by that process, ''Mexico and U.S. living
standards could become comparable so that we could move to an open
border,'' Aguilar said.
</P>
<P>
   Aguilar spoke to a luncheon gathering sponsored by the
U.S.-Mexican Forum, and was joined by Jorge Castaneda, another Fox
adviser. Fox won Mexico's presidential elections on July 2, ending
the 71-year domination of the Institutional Revolutionary Party. He
will be inaugurated on Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   At present the migration issue is one of the thorniest in
U.S.-Mexican relations.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has said an American worker makes 12 times the income of a
Mexican worker. The challenge for the two countries is ''to close
that brutal difference,'' he has said.
</P>
<P>
   Far from relaxing border patrols, the trend in the United States
has been to reinforce them in recent years, particularly in safer
areas where large cities are located. This has forced determined
migrants to attempt crossings in mountainous areas and other
dangerous spots, leading to substantial loss of life.
</P>
<P>
   The death toll at points along the California border alone has
averaged about 100 a year for the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   On drug-trafficking, Aguilar said the Fox administration will be
''unyielding'' in its efforts to root out corruption in Mexico's
counter-narcotics forces and also will carry out major
organizational reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Fox also hopes to rely more heavily on cooperative counterdrug
arrangements with the United States and other countries as part of
a ''coherent international effort'' to combat the drug scourge,
Aguilar said.
</P>
<P>
   According to U.S. estimates, up to 60 percent of U.S.-bound,
South American cocaine passes through Mexico. Mexican heroin
production is estimated at 4 to 6 metric tons annually, virtually
all of which is exported to the United States.

<HEADLINE> House Recommends Charges On Group  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House panel on Wednesday recommended that
contempt of Congress charges be brought against a government
watchdog group, three of its officials and an Interior Department
worker.
</P>
<P>
   The 27-16 vote by the House Resources Committee was the latest
escalation in a fight between Republican lawmakers and the Project
on Government Oversight over the group's role in exposing oil
companies' underpayment of royalties to the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Debate on the measure grew so heated that the panel's top
Democrat, Rep. George Miller of California, got into a shouting
match with Republican Chairman Don Young of Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're out of order,'' Young snapped as Miller objected to
Young refusing to let Rep. Ron Kind, D-Wis., speak after a vote had
been called.
</P>
<P>
   ''This committee is out of order!'' Miller shouted.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the way the House is run. Behave yourself!'' Young
replied.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Neil Abercrombie of Hawaii was the only Democrat who joined
Republicans in voting for the contempt charge.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's Republicans are investigating whether POGO broke the
law by paying $383,000 each to Interior Department official Robert
Berman and former Energy Department official Robert Speir, who
worked on oil royalty issues. The Justice Department also is
investigating.
</P>
<P>
   ''A special interest group paid off public officials who used
inside information ... to line their own pockets,'' said Rep. Kevin
Brady, R-Tex.
</P>
<P>
   The watchdog group has said the payments were awards for public
service and not improper.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Berman and POGO said the contempt recommendation was
retaliation for their success in fighting oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   ''This action today is a continuing part of the effort by the
supporters of the big oil companies to punish Mr. Berman for his
15-year-long effort to bring to the public the fraudulent conduct''
of the oil industry, said Berman's lawyer, Steve Tabackman.
</P>
<P>
   Several major oil companies have paid the government more than
$200 million to settle lawsuits by POGO and other whistleblowers.
The lawsuits accused the companies of deliberately underpaying
royalties for oil pumped from under federal and American Indian
lands and waters.
</P>
<P>
   Berman, POGO executive director Danielle Brian, POGO board
member Henry Banta and POGO employee Keith Rutter have refused to
answer some questions and turn over some documents. Those records
include minutes of POGO board meetings and Brian's office and home
telephone records.
</P>
<P>
   Republican committee members ''don't like POGO,'' said the
group's lawyer, Stanley Brand. ''They don't like POGO standing on
its First Amendment rights, and they've decided to go forward
notwithstanding the myriad flaws and deficiencies in their
process.''
</P>
<P>
   A vote by the full House is needed to send the matter to federal
prosecutors, who would decide whether to bring a misdemeanor charge
that carries a maximum penalty of a year in jail and a $1,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   The last contempt of Congress prosecution was of former
Environmental Protection Agency official Rita Lavelle in 1983. She
was acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   The contempt recommendation is the first from a House panel
since 1998, when the Government Reform and Oversight Committee
sought contempt charges against Attorney General Janet Reno. The
full House never voted on that recommendation.

<HEADLINE> Commerce Nominee Vows Great Focus  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Norman Mineta, President Clinton's nominee for
commerce secretary, promised Wednesday to pursue free and fair
trade, economic growth and ''digital inclusion'' for people left
out of the technology boom as senators assured him of prompt
confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   Mineta, a former House member who is an executive with the
biggest U.S. defense contractor, would become the first
Asian-American Cabinet secretary as the administration's most
visible emissary to corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment would be for only six months, through the end of
Clinton's term. Mineta would succeed William Daley, who recently
left to run Vice President Al Gore's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''Six months of opportunity and responsibility will demand a
greater focus to make a greater difference,'' Mineta told the
Senate Commerce Committee at his confirmation hearing, where he was
warmly received.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the committee's chairman, said the
panel planned to approve his nomination quickly and send it to the
full Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Mineta said he intends to work on keeping the economy growing,
developing new foreign markets for American business, helping
develop technology, rebuilding fisheries and keeping the Commerce
Department accessible and accountable.
</P>
<P>
   He listed his priorities: ''new markets, free and fair trade,
research enabling the creation of advanced American products and
services, e-commerce, a policy of digital inclusion to bridge the
digital divide, and the best scientific data.''
</P>
<P>
   ''My whole being is about dealing with the issues of the
underserved and the underprotected,'' Mineta said.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing technology to poor inner-city people and isolated rural
areas, he testified, ''is where I think the public and the private
sectors can really shine'' working together.
</P>
<P>
   Mineta, 68, a Japanese-American who spent his childhood in a
Wyoming internment camp during World War II, represented the
Silicon Valley area of northern California in the House for 21
years. He rose to become chairman of the House Public Works and
Transportation Committee in 1993 but lost his title after
Republicans won control of the House in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, Mineta led efforts to build high-tech
transportation systems. His handiwork was apparent in the 1991
transportation law, which included $660 million for research into
intelligent highway systems.
</P>
<P>
   He resigned midterm in 1995 to join Lockheed Martin Corp., the
nation's largest defense contractor, as senior vice president of
its transportation systems and services division.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lockheed Martin received $12.7 billion in defense
contracts in fiscal year 1999, Mineta's role was in helping the
company lessen its dependence on a shrinking Pentagon pie. His
company, Lockheed Martin IMS, builds and operates electronic toll
collection systems designed to allow vehicles to go through booths
without stopping.
</P>
<P>
   His corporate work has raised questions about how he would
distance himself as commerce secretary from decisions affecting his
former company. Mineta has told the Commerce Committee in writing
that, if confirmed, he will consult with ethics officials at the
Commerce Department and, if necessary, sell stock or other personal
assets that could create a conflict of interest or recuse himself
from taking actions in certain areas.
</P>
<P>
   The issue did not arise at the confirmation hearing. McCain did
mention, however, criticisms of the Commerce Department in recent
years as ''a dumping ground for the politically connected'' and its
alleged prior use of overseas trade missions to reward political
party donors.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge concluded in a 1998 ruling that Commerce
officials systematically concealed and destroyed documents that
might have revealed whether spaces on trade missions for business
executives were used as rewards for Democratic Party contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Mineta promised ''to make sure that the political aspects of
(trade missions) are minimized'' or eliminated.

<HEADLINE> Wellstone Offers State Health Plans  </HEADLINE>
By FREDERIC J. FROMMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- One of the Senate's most liberal members is
proposing a universal health care plan with a Republican twist: Let
states come up with their own plans.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got to have a proposal that fits in the mood set of the
country,'' said Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., as he announced the
legislation Wednesday. He said he was trying to avoid the pitfalls
of the failed 1993 Clinton administration plan, which he called
''too complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Forty-five million Americans have no coverage and we're not
talking about universal health coverage?'' Wellstone said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, the federal government would provide matching
funds of 70 percent to 75 percent to states, which would devise
their own plans for universal coverage. They could use employer
mandates, single-payer systems, or other ways to achieve it. States
would have to design a plan that guarantees affordable health care
by the end of 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Families making less than $25,000 a year would pay no more than
0.5 percent of their income in health care costs; those making
between $25,000 and $50,000 would pay a maximum of 5 percent; and
families making $50,000 or more would pay no more than 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   He estimated his plan would cost $700 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's one-third of the (projected) surplus,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone unveiled the plan with the Service Employees
International Union, the nation's largest health care union, which
will runs ads during the Republican and Democratic conventions
promoting the need for affordable health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Blendon, a Harvard professor of health policy and
political analysis, said it was significant that a liberal Democrat
had offered a plan that is not run by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ''In today's America, it's political genius'' to let states
design their own plans, Blendon said, saying such a proposal has a
much better chance of winning Republican support than a centralized
one.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the government couldn't rely on surplus money to
fund the program indefinitely. ''Someday, we'd have to face up to
how we'd pay for it.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The bill is S. 2888

<HEADLINE> Audit Shows Poor Army Accounting  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army's record-keeping is so poor that it
cannot confirm the receipt of hundreds of millions of dollars worth
of spare parts and other materials, including some classified
items, congressional auditors found.
</P>
<P>
   The Army could not account for $883 million in shipped inventory
in the 1998 budget year, in addition to confirmed shipment losses
of $297,000 that year, the General Accounting Office said in a
report released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Army does not know the exact extent to which shipped
inventory is lost or stolen because of weaknesses in inventory
controls and financial management practices,'' the report said. It
said the Army failed to follow up on late shipments and to maintain
records of shipment losses.
</P>
<P>
   The $883 million of unconfirmed inventory was not all lost, the
report said. It said the inventory had been shipped from
warehouses, suppliers and other sources but was not acknowledged as
received.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of these shipments that had not been acknowledged as
received may represent additional lost or stolen items,'' the
report said, adding that the Army's ''underlying records are not
sufficiently reliable to determine the extent of losses actually
incurred.''
</P>
<P>
   In a written response to a draft of the report, the Defense
Department agreed that changes are needed and said the Army will
increase oversight of shipped inventory. The Army also is in the
process of changing its automation systems so that they retain
records of unconfirmed warehoused material shipments, it said.
</P>
<P>
   The review of Army procedures for tracking and controlling spare
parts and other inventory items was requested by Sens. Thomas
Harkin of Iowa and Dick Durbin of Illinois and Reps. Peter DeFazio
of Oregon and Carolyn Maloney of New York, all Democrats. The
auditors mainly examined records at the Army's Aviation and Missile
Command, which is responsible for the largest portion of Army
shipped inventory.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's outrageous that the Army lost track of almost $900
million worth of equipment -- some classified or sensitive -- and
never bothered to investigate it,'' Harkin said in a written
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The classified items among the unaccounted for supplies included
guided missile control systems.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office report is one in a series it has
produced on the vulnerability of defense inventories to fraud,
waste and abuse.

<HEADLINE> Sigmoidoscopy May Miss Cancer  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF DONN
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sigmoidoscopy, the most widely used fiber-optic screening exam
for colon cancer, is likely to miss diseased growths as much as
one-third of the time, researchers say in a study that could lead
to wider use of a more thorough method, colonoscopy.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, along with a second study reported in Thursday's
New England Journal of Medicine, deepen doubts about the
reliability of sigmoidoscopy.
</P>
<P>
   Both sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy use a flexible tube that is
inserted in the rectum to examine the large intestine for cancerous
or precancerous polyps.
</P>
<P>
   Sigmoidoscopy, which reaches only part way up the colon, is
commonly used for checking patients at no special risk for colon
and rectal cancer. Colonoscopy, which reaches all the way up the
colon, is widely used for higher-risk patients, such as those with
a family history of the disease, blood in stool, or previous
growths in their colon.
</P>
<P>
   ''These two articles are changing the ground rules a bit,'' said
Dr. Harris Clearfield, a professor of medicine at MCP Hahnemann
University in Philadelphia. ''There will definitely be lives saved
with colonoscopy in average-risk patients, and I think there's
going to be increasing attention paid to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Colon and rectal cancer killed about 56,000 people in the United
States last year. Colorectal cancer is second only to lung cancer
in causing cancer deaths. About 130,000 cases were diagnosed last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Sigmoidoscopies are carried out in a doctor's office without
sedation and generally cost less than $200. Colonoscopies require
sedation and normally take place in hospitals or special surgical
sites at a cost of $700 or more. Tearing and other serious
bleeding, though rare, happen more often with colonoscopies.
</P>
<P>
   In sigmoidoscopy, the tube is inserted only about two feet up
the colon. The device shows the colon on a video screen and removes
any worrisome growths. If such growths are found, a colonoscopy
will usually be performed later to examine the entire colon, which
snakes up about five feet to the small intestine.
</P>
<P>
   In the largest study ever of colonoscopy, researchers examined
3,121 men ages 50 to 75 with no symptoms of colon or rectal cancer
at 13 U.S. veterans hospitals. At least 52 percent with cancer or
advanced precancerous polyps in the upper colon had no precancerous
polyps in the lower colon or rectum. Altogether, between 20 percent
to 32 percent of men with advanced growths would thus be overlooked
by sigmoidoscopy alone.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I'm a patient and I'm going to be told there's a 1-in-3 or
a 1-in-5 chance we're going to miss something on that exam, I'm not
sure I'd be reassured,'' said Dr. David Lieberman, the lead
researcher at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   The second study, carried out at Indiana University Medical
Center and three other sites, analyzed colonoscopy results from
screenings of 1994 men and women in a health program at Eli Lilly
and Co., the drug maker. Sixty-two percent with advanced polyps in
their upper colon showed no precancerous polyps in the lower
section.
</P>
<P>
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Daniel Podolsky of
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston said colonoscopy could, at
least in theory, eradicate the vast majority of colorectal cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on sigmoidoscopy makes as much medical sense as
''performing mammography of one breast to screen women for breast
cancer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most government and private health organizations recommend that
people 50 and older be screened for colon and rectal cancer with
sigmoidoscopy every five years and each year with a test that
detects blood in the stool. Insurance companies generally cover
those two tests to screen healthy patients.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Thomas Imperiale, who led the second study, said he favors
broader use of colonoscopy for older patients or others who may be
at higher risk. But he added, ''To go to a strategy of screening
everyone with colonoscopy doesn't make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is invasive, it is costly, and we're talking about millions
of people,'' said Dr. Sidney Winawer of Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center in New York. While also advocating more colonoscopy,
he said other research must clarify the role of colonoscopy in
preventing deaths.
</P>
<P>
   About three quarters of patients with insurance coverage fail to
seek colon cancer screening already. ''If you go to colonoscopy,
there may be more resistance,'' warned Dr. Donald Young, medical
director of the Health Insurance Association of America.

<HEADLINE> 10-year-old girl dies after freak golf club accident at W. Milford day camp </HEADLINE>
By WAYNE PARRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   PATERSON, N.J. (AP) - It was a sunny summer day in the country:
kids running, laughing and playing at a West Milford day camp for
underprivileged children.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in an instant, it turned tragic as a 10-year-old girl was
critically injured Tuesday when a playmate accidentally struck her
in the head with a plastic golf club.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning, Shadriah Benbow of Paterson died of her
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was my baby,'' said her father, Terry Benbow. ''I'm
devastated. It's just a tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Police termed her death a freak accident, and said there was no
indication of foul play. Lt. Andrew Russo said Benbow and several
other children were playing a game at about 11 a.m. with plastic
golf clubs and a plastic ball, knocking it back and forth when one
child swung the club, striking Benbow in the left temple.
</P>
<P>
   Benbow's cousins, Faashia and Latoya Forbes, saw the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ''She got hit on the left side, and her eyes rolled up into her
head,'' 11-year-old Faashia told the Herald News of West Paterson
for Wednesday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The girl who hit her was crying, saying she didn't mean it,''
added 14-year-old Latoya.
</P>
<P>
   Benbow was knocked unconscious, and her condition quickly
deteriorated, Russo said. Rescuers began cardiopulmonary
resuscitation at the scene and rushed her to St. Joseph's Hospital
&AMP; Medical Center in Paterson, where she died just before 4 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''They say it burst blood vessels in her head,'' Terry Benbow
said. ''There was internal bleeding. She had brain damage.''
</P>
<P>
   The girl's aunt, Denise Henderson, spoke to Shadriah's mother,
Gwendolyn, early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was in the hospital, and all of a sudden, (Shadriah)
opened her eyes, she said, 'Mommy,' and she was gone,'' Henderson
said. ''I haven't stopped crying since 7 this morning. She was a
sweet little girl, real smart. It's a shame she had to leave this
Earth in that kind of way.''
</P>
<P>
   Russo said detectives will interview witnesses, including other
children who were at the camp, counselors, and three teen-age
volunteers who were at the camp.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no indication that it was anything other than an
accident,'' Russo said. ''But because she died, it makes it a much
more serious case, and we're continuing to do a follow-up
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The 21-inch-long ''Big Boing Golf Club,'' manufactured by the
Koosh Jr. Co., is made of hollow plastic with a 7-inch-by-5-inch
hollow base. It was purchased at a Toys 'R' Us store by the
probation department for use at the camp.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives recalled the smiling little girl who had just
celebrated her 10th birthday on July 9 and had just graduated from
P.S. 28, where she was recently named student of the month.
</P>
<P>
   ''She loved to dance,'' her father recalled. ''She'd dance her
legs off if she could. She loved that and loved sports.''
</P>
<P>
   ''She was just at my house on Monday, showing me her graduation
picture,'' Henderson said. ''I teased her about it. I said, 'That's
not you,' and she'd day, ''Yes, it's really me!' ''
</P>
<P>
   The campsite is owned by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Paterson
and formerly housed CYO activities. It is leased by the probation
department, which runs the day camp.
</P>
<P>
   Every summer since 1987, buses driven by probation officers have
picked up about 50 children, mostly from Paterson, ranging in age
from 8 to 12, taking them to a rural setting to enjoy swimming and
sports. The free program also provides lunch and transportation
home.
</P>
<P>
   ''The idea is to get the kids out of the city and provide them
some positive, healthy outdoor activities, as well as to get them
to know the probation officers in a positive setting, which may be
differently from how they see them in their own neighborhoods,''
said Winnie Comfort, a spokeswoman for the state Administrative
Office of the Courts.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the accident, there were 39 children, seven
adults and three teen volunteers at the camp. Comfort said two of
the adults were supervising the four girls who were playing the
golfing game and were standing close by when the accident happened.
</P>
<P>
   The campsite, which Russo said does not have a formal name, was
closed on Wednesday. The county was to make grief counselors
available to anyone who needed them.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Benbow said he wants to see the spot where his daughter
died and view the club that killed her.
</P>
<P>
   ''I need to get the right information about what went on and
then put her to rest in peace,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Environmentalist Targeted  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY DUNPHY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Alexander Nikitin, a Russian environmental
whistle-blower acquitted by Russia's Surpeme Court of exposing
state secrets, said Wednesday his country's prosecutor general
wants to retry him.
</P>
<P>
   The former Russian Navy captain, in town to receive an
environmental award and testify before Congress, said the
prosecutor's office is appealing his acquittal earlier this year.
He had been accused of exposing state secrets by writing a report
on the Russian Navy's unsafe storage of nuclear waste.
</P>
<P>
   Nikitin said the appeal, to be heard Aug. 2 by the 11-member
presidium of the Russian court, requests the case be sent back for
further investigation. He said his Moscow lawyer informed him of
the action by telephone Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Nikitin believes Russia's Federal Security Service, known as the
FSB, is behind the appeal. The FSB is the successor to the
Soviet-era KGB.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very unexpected,'' Nikitin said. ''I am extremely
surprised they decided to go down this path. It shows the stupidity
of the government.''
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, a duty officer at the security service said he knew
nothing about the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The court may refuse to hear the case, which started in 1996,
but proceedings could last years if the judges decide to go ahead,
Nikitin said.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived in the United States last week to receive the
prestigious Goldman environmental award that he could not collect
in 1997 because he was in prison. His passport was returned to him
one month ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club, Amnesty International and the Union of Councils
for Soviet Jews are hosting his visit to congressional and Clinton
administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   He was to give a briefing to the Commission on Security and
Cooperation in Europe Thursday in a House office building.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club and Amnesty International said they were
''extremely concerned for Nikitin and for the message this move by
the (security service) conveys about the prospects for democracy
and environmental protection in Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   On April 17, a branch of the Russian Supreme Court upheld a
lower court's acquittal of Nikitin.
</P>
<P>
   Security agents arrested Nikitin, a soft-spoken naval engineer
and expert in nuclear waste issues, in 1996 and held him for 10
months in an isolated chamber in a Federal Security Service jail in
St. Petersburg. He was working on a report for the Norway-based
Bellona environmental group at the time on nuclear waste dumps in
Russia's Arctic.
</P>
<P>
   Nikitin's case wound through the courts for four years. Human
rights groups said it pitted Russia's security apparatus, with its
emphasis on secrecy and avoiding embarrassment for the state,
against fledgling values of civil society and independence in
post-Communist Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Nikitin was denied permission to travel abroad while the case
was pending to visit his wife and daughter, who reside in Canada.

<HEADLINE> Groups hope to get GOP's attention with marches on eve of convention </HEADLINE>
By BRENDAN SCHURR
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - Just as various groups planning protests at
the Republican National Convention will be advocating different
causes, so too will they take different approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Unity 2000, a coalition of citizens groups, are
pledging that there will be no confrontation with authorities as
they make their way from Camden to Philadelphia. Others, including
a group led by a Camden councilman, are making no such promises.
</P>
<P>
   The convention will be held in Philadelphia from July 31-Aug. 3,
with opening ceremonies scheduled for Sunday, July 30, in Camden.
With the region in the limelight, advocacy groups are hoping to
bring attention to the causes, and people, they say are being
ignored by politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Unity 2000 wants legislators to focus more attention on poverty,
health care, homelessness, the environment, racism, sexism,
religious intolerance, homophobia, globalism, militarism, campaign
finance reform and alleged injustice in the legal and prison
systems.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope to utilize the press that will be there to bring up
the issues that aren't getting talked about,'' said Kim Madden, of
the Camden-Gloucester County Green Party, which is part of the
Unity 2000 coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ''As all these people are at this march, we hope that the
American people who can't come can see that people are thinking
about this stuff, that we're trying to change this,'' she said
Wednesday. ''Hopefully, through this they'll want to become
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Group leaders point out that they aren't just targeting
Republicans. Their counterparts will protest at the Democratic
National Convention Aug. 14-17 in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are taking to the streets because the politics-as-usual
attitude of both major political parties has ignored our voices and
concerns,'' says the Unity 2000 Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Norm Cohen, executive director of the Coalition for Peace and
Justice, another group in the coalition, said the march will be
''definitely, totally, completely peaceful.''
</P>
<P>
   But the leader of a group that plans to protest what it calls
unfair treatment of Camden residents by the state and by Gov.
Christie Whitman said it has a ''secret plan'' to shut down Admiral
Wilson Boulevard, the highway leading through Camden into
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not planning any violence, we're planning to address the
issues of Camden,'' said Councilman Ali Sloan El. ''If Whitman
wants to contest that, we'll be there waiting on her. If she wants
to step up and resist us walking, then there will be some problems.
We're going to walk. The only violence I foresee is if the state
denies us the right to walk down Admiral Wilson Boulevard.''
</P>
<P>
   Sloan El also is calling on Whitman to apologize for frisking a
black Camden man four years ago while riding along on patrols by
police and state troopers. A photo of the governor patting down the
man has revived accusations that her administration is insensitive
to minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman has defended her participation in the pat-down. Her
spokesman, Peter McDonough, said Wednesday that the state's actions
in Camden - overseeing the city's finances and its police
department and investing $2.2 billion in the city in five years -
have benefited residents.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people who are protesting the loudest about our entire
role in Camden are the people who have the most to lose if we break
the cycle of dependency on corruption in Camden,'' McDonough said.
''Those people ... have in many ways seized on this photo as yet
another reason we shouldn't shake up the status quo.''
</P>
<P>
   Sloan El said his group will march from Baird Boulevard at about
4:30 p.m. on July 30 to Mickle Boulevard and Broadway, where they
will join other marchers, then walk to the New Jersey State
Aquarium, site of the convention's opening ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   The Unity 2000 protesters planned to meet at the Rutgers-Camden
campus, then march over the Ben Franklin Bridge to join other
activists in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   But they might wind up taking a ferry or the PATCO rail line.
The bridge walkway will probably be closed for security reasons,
said Joe Diemer, spokesman for the Delaware River Port Authority,
which operates the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of vehicles crossing the bridge during that time will
need additional security,'' he said. ''That's just an area that
it's not a good idea to have open.''

<HEADLINE> An analysis of Hillary Clinton's latest Senate ad  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   An analysis of Hillary Rodham Clinton's latest Senate
campaign
ad:
<TEXT>
<P>
   TITLE: ''Economy.''
</P>
<P>
   LENGTH: 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: Political consultant Mandy Grunwald and ''Team
Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
   AIRING: Upstate television markets, beginning Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   SCRIPT:
</P>
<P>
   (Hillary Clinton): How many of you have known somebody who has
had to leave because they had to go somewhere else for work? How
many of you have known people like that?
</P>
<P>
   (Announcer): She understands that families are struggling
because she's listened, person to person, in all 62 counties of New
York. Now Hillary's outlined a specific plan to bring new jobs to
every corner of New York so no one is left behind in the new
economy. Read it and you'll see. Hillary's fighting to make sure
our children can build their futures here. She'll always put our
families first.
</P>
<P>
   IMAGES: The advertisement opens with a clip of Clinton talking
to a roomful of people. Close-ups of the listeners show an old man
smiling and a woman nodding. Many of the listeners then raise their
hand, along with her, in answer to the question she's posed. The
clip gives way to various shots of Clinton holding a baby, hugging
a woman, sitting at a table in an intense discussion with a group
of people, and surrounded by children.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on the screen beneath these images are the words:
</P>
<P>
   -''Hillary's job plan: tax cuts for new jobs''
</P>
<P>
   -''Ideas to lower airfare and utility rates''
</P>
<P>
   -''For a copy call 1-888-HILLARY or go to www.hillary2000.org.''
</P>
<P>
   The invitation refers to a booklet detailing Clinton's economic
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ANALYSIS: The opening clip, in which she raises her hand in
answer to her own question while her audience follows suit,
symbolically suggests that Clinton identifies with the problems of
upstaters. The series of clips that follow depict an energetic and
diligent candidate who appears to be well-received by the smiling
individuals, young and old, who meet her. The voice-over's
assertion that she has visited all 62 counties is intended to
counter concerns among some voters that she is a carpetbagger who
doesn't have the credentials to be a senator.
</P>
<P>
   The invitation to call the campaign or contact its Web site is
meant to indicate that there are substantive proposals to back up
the fast-paced images. A viewer who is intrigued enough to follow
up and contact the campaign gets a detailed description of
Clinton's ideas for improving the economy - as well as an
invitation to donate time or money.

<HEADLINE> 'Survivor' Secret May Be Out  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A posting that briefly appeared on a CBS Web
site Wednesday may have inadvertently revealed which contestant was
kicked off ''Survivor,'' six hours before TV viewers learned the
secret.
</P>
<P>
   A writer who was checking the www.cbs.com Web site for news of
''Survivor'' on Wednesday afternoon said he was startled to see a
headline revealing which of the nine remaining island inhabitants
would be voted off. The show airs on CBS at 8 p.m. EDT.
</P>
<P>
   The writer, Richard Foster, said he clicked on to the Web site
and saw a full story of what happened in the episode -- similar to
what CBS usually posts after the episode airs. He said that he
began downloading the article, but that it disappeared from the Web
site before he could complete the job.
</P>
<P>
   Foster immediately posted his own article about what he saw on
the Web site he works for, www.richmond.com, which is devoted to
news about Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The posting said that Greg Buis, the wacky Colorado resident
best known for pretending a coconut was a cell phone, was sent
home.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at CBS would not comment on the substance of what was
posted. The network has been trying hard to keep secret who stays
and who goes on the island, knowing the mystery is key to the
appeal of the enormously successful summer series.
</P>
<P>
   ''We continue to decline comment on all rumors and speculation
pertaining to 'Survivor,' except to note that there has been
hacking into our system in the past,'' said Gil Schwartz, a CBS
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   There are several possibilities: A computer hacker may have
gained access to CBS' site and posted either erroneous information
or a story that CBS had prepared. A CBS employee may have made a
mistake. Or perhaps the network was letting out false information
to throw theorists off.
</P>
<P>
   Foster said he believed the information was legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was too obviously a goof-up,'' he said. ''If they were
trying to throw people off, it would have been a hell of a lot of
work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the show were already buzzing about another computer
user's discovery that CBS Web designers, in material supposedly
unavailable to the public, had placed a red X over pictures of all
16 ''Survivor'' contestants except for one -- youth basketball coach
Gervase Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   That has led many fans to conclude that Peterson will be the
million-dollar winner on the show's final episode, which airs Aug.
23.
</P>
<P>
   Foster said he checks the CBS Web site frequently for
''Survivor'' news because one of the contestants, former Navy SEAL
Rudy Boesch, lives in the area.

<HEADLINE> Disputed Creed To Run on Memorial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The National Park Service has decided to
retain a disputed ''Japanese American creed'' for a memorial to
Japanese Americans who fought in World War II or were interned in
camps.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to one of the opponents of the inscription, parks
Director Robert Stanton noted that the sponsoring foundation's
board has repeatedly voted to include the words and they already
have been sandblasted into a stone panel.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must respect their views,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton's letter, dated July 12, was made public by an
opposition group that identifies itself with the address of its
website: JAvoice.com. Group leaders said in a statement they were
disappointed. They had gathered the signatures of 947 Japanese
Americans on a petition asking Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt to
review the inscription.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton wrote group member Rita Takahashi, of Berkeley, Calif.,
that some other requested changes would be made, including the
insertion of the word ''minimal'' to describe compensation given to
internees.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thank you and others who have brought these points to our
attention,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The objection to the creed centered not on the text, but on the
author: the late Mike Masaoka, who critics said helped U.S.
authorities ''in herding Japanese Americans into camps.'' He served
as field secretary for the Japanese American Citizens League.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say Masaoka is being unfairly blamed and note he was
respected and politically influential for many years after the war.
</P>
<P>
   The quotation from his creed used on the memorial says:
</P>
<P>
   ''I am proud that I am an American citizen of Japanese ancestry,
for my very background makes me appreciate more fully the wonderful
advantages of this nation. I believe in her institutions, ideals
and traditions. I glory in her heritage; I boast of her history: I
trust in her future.''
</P>
<P>
   In February, the board of the National Japanese American
Memorial Foundation voted 27-6, with one abstention, to keep the
inscription.
</P>
<P>
   John Parsons, associate regional director of the Park Service,
confirmed the decision and said the stone panel is still in Cold
Spring, Minn., where parts of the memorial are being put together
before transport to a site near the U.S. Capitol. The foundation
plans to dedicate it in November.

<HEADLINE> Ex-official says governor's office manipulated parole board  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A former parole official testified Wednesday
that the Division of Parole chairman - under pressure by the Pataki
administration - ordered him to orchestrate the early release of a
violent gang member.
</P>
<P>
   The inmate's parents had arranged thousands of dollars in
campaign contributions for Gov. George Pataki in what prosecutors
say was a bribe solicited by a Republican fund-raiser and
businessman, Yung Soo Yoo.
</P>
<P>
   Yoo, 63, of Glen Ridge, N.J., is on trial in Brooklyn federal
court, charged with campaign corruption and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   The former official, Ronald Hotaling, 53, described a 1996
meeting in which Pataki-appointed parole Chairman Brion Travis told
him ''he was continuing to get a tremendous amount of pressure from
the governor's office to release John Kim.''
</P>
<P>
   Under orders from Travis, Hotaling relayed the message that
''the governor wants this guy released'' to two commissioners
deciding the fate of Kim, who had served the minimum of a
4-to-12-year sentence for three armed robberies in Queens. A few
days later, the commissioners voted to parole the inmate over the
objections of state prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was, in my opinion, inappropriate for the governor's office
to weigh in that way,'' said Hotaling, a 27-year veteran of the
Division of Parole.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors allege two other couples unsuccessfully sought to
buy the freedom of their felon sons with hefty contributions to
''Friends of Pataki'' - deals brokered by Yoo and a top campaign
aide, Patrick Donohue. They also say Travis and Pataki deputies
conspired to make good on the pairs' promises, all at a time when
the governor was taking a public stand against early release of
hardcore offenders.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1996 memo introduced as evidence, Yoo warned Donohue that
impatient parents were threatening to disclose their alleged deal
to the Korean media.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have two options: one, to rectify the above matter by
collaborating with (the parents) and finding a solution, or two,
return the money to them,'' Yoo wrote. The money was eventually
refunded.
</P>
<P>
   Yoo's attorney, Nicholas DeFeis, told U.S. District Judge
Frederic Block that he plans to call Donohue and Kim's father,
Queens pastor Nam Soo Kim, to the witness stand as part of the
defense case, which begins Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   No one close to the governor has been charged. The
administration has denied any wrongdoing, as has Donohue.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Travis, Tom Grant, attacked the credibility of
Hotaling, who is facing up to six month in prison after pleading
guilty last year to lying to federal investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to remember this is coming from an admitted liar. ...
Everything that was done was right and proper,'' Grant said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by the prosecution why he lied, Hotaling said he feared
shaming the parole board.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was scared, frankly, that I would be involved in some kind
of conspiracy,'' he said. ''I was trying to protect the integrity
of the board that I worked for, and that I loved.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yoo case stems from an ongoing federal investigation of an
alleged influence peddling scheme by Pataki aides in parole cases.
So far three parole officials - including Hotaling - have been
either charged or convicted.

<HEADLINE> Farming Town Braces for Oil Spill  </HEADLINE>
By MARCELO BALLVE
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALSA NOVA, Brazil (AP) -- Parents ordered children away from the
river on Wednesday while ranchers penned up their cattle in
preparation for the arrival of a massive oil spill drifting
straight toward this farming town.
</P>
<P>
   A mile upstream, dozens of workers with shovels and mechanical
backhoes raced to dig channels at a curve in the Iguacu River, the
most important in Parana state. They hoped to divert the slick into
sandpits or check it at floating barriers.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1 million gallons of crude oil spewed from a burst
pipeline Sunday at the Getulio Vargas refinery in Araucaria, about
435 miles southwest of Rio, in the country's worst spill in a
quarter century.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the oil flowed into a tributary of the Iguacu River,
which runs through the state to world-famous Iguacu Falls, hundreds
of miles away near Brazil's border with Argentina and Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities, however, have largely discounted fears that the
spill could contaminate the falls.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point the possibility of the oil reaching the falls is
very remote, almost impossible,'' said Eliana Fachim, spokeswoman
for the Parana State Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   But residents of this corn- and cattle-raising town, 30 miles
below the refinery, had other concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel like the river is my children's future,'' said
secretary Lizabete Alves. ''The oil harms the water and the nature
that belongs to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Workers in boots and carrying burlap sacks patrolled the
riverbank picking up oil-covered driftwood and trash, one step in a
cleanup that will take months. Next, Petrobras will remove
oil-impregnated mud and silt from the river bed and banks.
</P>
<P>
   Four barriers situated across the river failed to check the
spill. At the fifth, just upstream of town, the flow paused on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The stain has been contained at Balsa Nova,'' Fachim said in
the capital of Curitiba. ''There are still bits of oil floating in
the river, but now it's question of collecting all the small
pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   All but around 80,000 gallons of the oil have been removed from
the river, authorities said. Two other barriers were strung
protectively downstream, but cleanup workers acknowledged they
would be unable to catch the entire spill.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no equipment in the world that can contain oil in a
current above one knot,'' said Ricardo Brito, an engineer with
federal oil giant Petrobras and supervisor of the cleanup
operations. He said the Iguacu's current was 4 knots, about 4&AMP;frac12; mph.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the state environmental agency banned fishing
anywhere in the Iguacu River and its tributaries until further
notice. Laboratory tests showed the river water was tainted by oil
even after it was removed.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists said the full impact of the spill was still
unknown. The region's wildlife has been hard hit, including more
than 50 species of birds, 30 types of fish and water-loving
capybaras -- the world's largest rodent.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously there is a lot of worry,'' said Balsa Nova's town
manager Eloi Alceu. ''But even more worrying is that we won't know
for a long time what the long-term effects are.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said they would fine Petrobras $56 million.
Parana state said it would fine the company $28 million.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's worst oil disaster was in 1975, when an oil tanker from
Iraq dumped nearly 8 million gallons of crude into Guanabara Bay.
The oil washed up on Rio's famous beaches, which were closed for
nearly three weeks.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WHEATFIELD, N.Y. (AP) - It's a gorgeous July morning in western
New York, perfect for cutting hay or milking cows. Instead, two
dozen farmers are outside a barn listening as U.S. Senate candidate
Rick Lazio speaks.
</P>
<P>
   Misspeaks, actually.
</P>
<P>
   As he's done at many stops, Lazio introduces his wife, Patricia,
and their two daughters, then scans the crowd for them.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're having the ball of their lives,'' Lazio says of Molly,
6, and Kelsey, 8. ''They got to milk a little calf, and of course
their week is made now with that experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Milk a calf? Not on any farm around here, the farmers murmur
among themselves, gathered on a field in this aptly named farm town
near Niagara Falls.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really do feel like I'm home when I'm here,'' Lazio tells
them, unaware of the calf-gaffe. ''And I want you to know how
grateful I am for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Feeling at home may be the easiest part of political life for
the 42-year-old, four-term congressman. During much of the first
two months of his campaign, Lazio's entire family has traveled with
him from Brightwaters to Buffalo and back.
</P>
<P>
   It's a strategy that keeps the youthful candidate from missing
the comforts of home while boosting him politically. ''Vote for my
dad, he's great,'' the little Lazios bellow over a PA aboard a
campaign bus rolling through Lake Placid.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Lazio, who met her husband while studying to be a nurse,
even appears in the campaign's latest television commercial,
boosting her husband's stands on health care issues.
</P>
<P>
   And, while many upstate newspapers were running stories about
rival Hillary Rodham Clinton's own recent bus tour, the reports
were played alongside pictures of a doting Daddy Lazio painting his
daughter's fingernails or helping them FEED MILK to a newborn calf.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a hometown guy, he's a real person,'' says Mary Donahue,
a court clerk attending a recent Lazio rally in Schenectady. ''Like
he said, he pumps gas, he goes to the grocery store like everybody
else.... He's winning me over.''
</P>
<P>
   Winston Moeller, budget director for the town of Wheatfield,
says he was impressed by Lazio ''because he seems to be more down
to earth and more for the average, common person than I thought he
might be.''
</P>
<P>
   ---
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been busy,'' Patricia Lazio concedes during a Buffalo
Bisons double-header. It's near the end of a weeklong bus tour that
included three Fourth of July parades and visits to factories,
hospitals and village squares.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was a little bit reluctant about bringing the girls, but
they've been having such a great time,'' she says. ''And it's so
nice that we've gotten to spend some time together.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelsey, who enjoys Irish step-dancing, and Molly, who takes
ballet lessons, have become favorites of photographers who can't
get enough of the sisters - hanging out of the ''Mainstream
Express'' bus distributing Lazio hats, T-shirts and bumper
stickers.
</P>
<P>
   The Lazio girls have grown up in a political atmosphere, joining
their dad during congressional campaigns on Long Island. But the
Senate race has taken them farther afield in one of the most
closely watched elections in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience for them,'' their mother
says as the pair run to watch the antics of the Bisons' mascot.
''Just the things they've seen that they could never otherwise see
doing something like this. And the exposure and the experience has
been really fun.''
</P>
<P>
   So are more trips with dad likely?
</P>
<P>
   ''I think over the summer we'll see more trips,'' says Pat
Lazio. ''But once the fall comes, obviously they'll be back in
school and won't be able to come along.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidate adds: ''I'm sure Pat will try and find some
balance. She's very big in going over the homework with the kids
and making sure they do their homework at night and preparing them
for reading and math.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lazio, who as a kid used to trail his father, Tony, around
to Suffolk County GOP events, said he has no regrets about taking
the entire family on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been great to be able to travel with my family,'' he
says. ''I think that's a big plus to have them along. I think I
travel better with them. I'm happier.''
</P>
<P>
   ---
</P>
<P>
   Rick Lazio has trouble remembering the last movie he's seen,
noting that he's been a little preoccupied with the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was going to say ''Saving Private Ryan,'' he says, but then
the correct answer comes to him - as a look of horror envelopes his
face.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it was that last unbelievably bad movie that I had to
take the kids to'' - the recent ''Pokemon'' movie.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh, it was painful,'' he says. ''The first 10 minutes ...
there was no human sound. For 10 minutes! I'd like to run into the
creator of 'Pokemon' in a dark alley, I tell you that much. I'd be
the savior of a lot of parents.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Park Svc. Risks Fires  </HEADLINE>
By BART JANSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- At Yosemite National Park in California,
defective sprinklers meant to protect buildings from fires --
including structures where workers live -- haven't been replaced
despite a national recall.
</P>
<P>
   At Prince William Forest Park in Virginia, the 115 wooden cabins
lack smoke detectors and fire extinguishers. And the 250 buildings
in Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Park in California have never had
formal fire-safety inspections, despite 41 structural blazes since
1988.
</P>
<P>
   Such lapses in fire prevention efforts are common nationwide,
says a General Accounting Office study that criticized the National
Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   ''Structural fire safety efforts in national parks are not
effective,'' GAO official Jim Wells told a House Budget task force
hearing Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Among the complaints at six parks visited were fire
extinguishers left unchecked for years, overnight accommodations
not inspected by certified safety officials and cabins without
smoke detectors.
</P>
<P>
   ''It saddens me that despite an annual budget of $1 billion to
operate its parks, the Park Service cannot manage to keep their
structures safe from fire,'' said Rep. George Radanovich, R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Park officials didn't dispute the findings, but said they expect
to coordinate plans nationally by September about how to meet
safety standards. The service created a post in Boise, Idaho, to
coordinate fire-safety plans and budgeted $6.6 million during the
next five years to install fire alarms and upgrade fire hydrants in
46 projects.
</P>
<P>
   ''The report offers us an opportunity to begin the development
of a comprehensive structural fire program,'' said Maureen
Finnerty, associate director of park operations at the Interior
Department.
</P>
<P>
   With 30,000 buildings in 379 parks, the service is the country's
third largest landlord behind the Defense Department and U.S.
Postal Service. Despite publicity for wildland fires such as
Yellowstone National Park in 1988, there have been more than 1,400
building fires at national parks since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   But the service never singled out firefighting in its budgets,
leaving local managers to develop their own safety plans until
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have known for quite some time that the programs needed a
close looking at,'' said Ed Duncan, fire management officer at
Yosemite. ''There is never enough (money) to cover all the needs
that we have.''
</P>
<P>
   At Yosemite, officials missed a U.S. Consumer Product Safety
Commission deadline to have a company replace its defective
sprinkler heads that sometimes fail to respond when heated. The
park still qualifies for replacement parts, but its own workers
will have to install the heads, Duncan said.
</P>
<P>
   Another difficulty facing park officials is the need to upgrade
historic buildings with modern firefighting equipment. The 123-room
Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite is getting a new smoke detection system
this year to replace its 20-year-old version. But officials plan to
hire a special contractor for advice on how to install sprinklers
in the hotel, a historic national landmark.
</P>
<P>
   Jody Lyle, a spokesman for Sequoia, said many park buildings are
small sheds that the public doesn't visit. She noted that even
modern smoke detectors and sprinklers didn't prevent a fire this
year in the new John Muir Lodge at her park.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everywhere that a visitor is going to be in the parks, whether
it's a gift shop or a lodge or public building, there are smoke
detectors,'' she said. ''We would love to see an increase in
funding so we could fix some of these problems.''

<HEADLINE> US Bases Said Vulnerable to Attack  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BRISCOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. forces around the world remain vulnerable
to terrorist attack despite improvements made after a truck bomb
killed 19 Americans at a U.S. military complex in Saudi Arabia four
years ago, congressional investigators reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Among the examples from unidentified installations abroad: A
pizza delivery man did not realize he had entered a U.S. military
compound; students at an American base in Europe have created a
shortcut by cutting holes in the fence; at a Pacific base, local
residents' drain pipes extend through the base wall.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said the report contained errors and did not
reflect its ''strong commitment to combat terrorism.'' Officials
agreed with some recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators from the General Accounting Office visited 19
sites in Europe, the Mideast and the Pacific. Their report cited
several inadequacies in protection and procedures and gave examples
without disclosing the facilities' location.
</P>
<P>
   ''Significant security and procedural anti-terrorism/force
protection problems continue at many installations,'' said the
report from the GAO, the investigative arm of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   It noted a lack of effective ways of stopping unauthorized
vehicles, of workable plans for dealing with terrorist attacks, and
of secure access to important intelligence information at some U.S.
installations.
</P>
<P>
   The report praised the Pentagon for developing standards to
ensure that anti-terrorism protections are included in all new
construction. It also mentioned the creation of permanent
anti-terrorism protection offices and development of systems for
monitoring vulnerabilities at bases around the world.
</P>
<P>
   But a lack of funds for local commands has left some vulnerable,
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Congress does not have an accurate picture of the extent of
the risk that U.S. forces face from terrorism,'' the report said,
urging the Defense Department to provide a list of all unfunded
anti-terrorism projects.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon, in the response by Brian E. Sheridan of the
special operations and low-intensity conflict office, agreed on a
need for improvement in vulnerability assessment reporting and in
training of anti-terrorism managers. It said a separate report on
unfunded projects is unnecessary because the most critical programs
are funded.
</P>
<P>
   Sheridan's response cited ''numerous inaccuracies'' and said the
report ''should not and cannot be used as a measure of quantifying
(the department's) true anti-terrorism posture.''
</P>
<P>
   Among problems cited in the report:
</P>
<P>
   --Some Pacific installations have no gates or other means of
stopping unauthorized vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   -- A barrier system designed to stop cars at one base was broken
and there were no plans to fix it because it was not considered
cost effective to keep it operating in cold weather.
</P>
<P>
   --Guards at some gates were unaware of control procedures or did
not follow them.
</P>
<P>
   --Perimeter fences were overgrown or poorly maintained.
</P>
<P>
   --Some facilities have no system for alerting personnel to an
attack or threat.
</P>
<P>
   -- Air Force and Army personnel assigned to security or
intelligence often are deployed elsewhere, leaving facilities
unprotected.

<HEADLINE> Judge: Mistake by U.S. forces means stolen art can be returned to Austria </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A judge ruled Wednesday that ''Portrait of
Wally,'' a painting by Egon Schiele allegedly stolen by the Nazis,
can be returned to Austria because it is no longer considered
stolen in the eyes of the law.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Michael Mukasey's ruling dismissed legal
challenges to the removal of the art from the United States, but he
immediately stayed its effect to allow a possible appeal by the
federal government. The painting, worth about $2 million, already
has been in the country more than two years after its scheduled
return to Austria.
</P>
<P>
   It became embroiled in a legal dispute after it was loaned by
the Leopold Foundation in Vienna for a 90-day exhibit at the Museum
of Modern Art that ended Jan. 4, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Bondi of Princeton, N.J., sought to block the return of
the painting by the early 20th century Austrian artist. He
maintained it had been seized by the Nazis from the art gallery of
his late aunt, Lea Bondi Jaray, a Viennese Jew, in 1938 as she fled
to London. Lawrence Kaye, a lawyer for the family, said he could
not immediately comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The legal challenge wound its way through the state courts until
New York's highest court decided state prosecutors could not keep
the painting in the United States by subpoenaing it.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White then stepped in, gaining a federal
warrant to keep the painting in the country while she sought to
have it forfeited under a law permitting the seizure of any goods
brought into the country illegally.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, White called it ''an important policy of the United
States and other countries to return Holocaust-era looted
property.''
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Smilon, a spokesman for White, said after Wednesday's
ruling, ''We are reviewing the opinion to determine whether to
appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Mukasey said the case of the ''Portrait of Wally'' can be
distinguished from others because the painting was seized after the
war by U.S. armed forces when the man who had apparently stolen it
was arrested on suspicion of war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. forces were supposed to sort the paintings of
imprisoned suspects and return them to the countries from which
they had been taken, but they mistakenly gave ''Portrait of Wally''
to the wrong person, Heinrich Rieger, the judge wrote. His heirs
later sold it to Osterreichische Galerie Belvedere, the Austrian
National Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Mukasey said the painting lost its distinction as stolen art
when it was taken by U.S. forces in the same way that stolen items
recovered by police are no longer considered stolen.
</P>
<P>
   He said his reasoning stemmed in part from English cases holding
that goods recovered by their true owner lose their stolen
character. He added that in the United States, courts have
concluded that recovery by law enforcement officials may be
presumed to be recovery by the owner's agent.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although the painting may not have been placed in the correct
hands when the Rieger heirs received it, in the eyes of the law it
was no longer stolen,'' Mukasey said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the Museum of Modern Art said it was pleased
with the decision, and that it would move the museum one step
closer to returning the painting to Austria.
</P>
<P>
   William M. Barron, a lawyer for Leopold Museum-Privatstiftung,
called Mukasey's opinion ''very clear, focused, strong.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very pleased with it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the ruling contained numerous references to
earlier property recovery cases and suggested it would have little
bearing on other challenges to the ownership of World War II art.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think he's broken any new ground,'' Barron said of
Mukasey's legal reasoning.

<HEADLINE> Chile Court Opens Pinochet Hearing,  </HEADLINE>
By EDUARDO GALLARDO
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- The Supreme Court opened hearings
Wednesday to decide whether Gen. Augusto Pinochet should be tried
on human rights charges. It also denied a request for medical tests
of the ex-Chilean dictator to determine his fitness to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers had hoped to use the health tests to block the
start of the hearings. Attorneys wanted to prove that poor health
would prevent the 84-year-old leader from getting a fair trial
because he would be unable to organize an effective defense.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet has diabetes, uses a pacemaker and suffered three mild
strokes during 16 months of house detention in London, where he was
released after doctors said he was physically and mentally unfit to
stand trial. He had been detained on a warrant by a Spanish judge
wanting to try him.
</P>
<P>
   The court was also considering Pinochet's appeal of a ruling
that stripped him of his congressional immunity. By losing the
protection he enjoyed as senator-for-life, Pinochet is open to
charges related to one of the most notorious cases of abuse of his
1973-1990 dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint involves the ''caravan of death,'' a military
squad that toured Chilean cities after a 1973 Pinochet-led coup,
dragged 72 dissidents from prison and executed them. According to
an official report, 19 people remain unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of 146 criminal complaints filed against the former
dictator for deaths and disappearances blamed on his regime.
</P>
<P>
   The three days of hearings opened Wednesday amid tight security
as scores of supporters and foes of Pinochet demonstrated noisily
outside the court building.
</P>
<P>
   The first day consisted of a closed-door session during which
court official Ana Gloria Chevesich read a report on the state of
the case before the 20 justices.
</P>
<P>
   ''The background gathered so far totally fails to show any
relationship whatsoever between Gen. Pinochet and any criminal
acts,'' said Pablo Rodriguez, another Pinochet lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Eduardo Contreras, a lawyer for one of several plaintiffs, said
the report showed ''an undeniable position of command of Pinochet
over (Gen. Sergio) Arellano,'' the leader of the caravan.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's lawyer and seven lawyers for the plaintiffs are to
argue their cases Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The court has no deadline for its ruling, which cannot be
appealed. Chief Justice Hernan Alvarez said the decision will be
made known ''as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet, who was not required to appear in court, was calmly
following the courtroom activity from his heavily guarded Santiago
mansion, his son Marco Antonio said.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court affirms verdict, expands how whistle-blower law applies in private sector </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The state Supreme Court ruled Wednesday the
state's 1986 law designed to protect corporate whistle-blowers
applies even in cases in which no dramatic ''public interests,''
such as pollution or safety hazards, are at stake.
</P>
<P>
   The leading case on the whistle-blower law occurred in 1998 when
the Supreme Court affirmed a judgment in favor of a former Mobil
executive who claimed he had been fired in retribution for his
disclosures that gasoline being sold in Japan was unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   Fired employees who try to make claims as whistle-blowers must
show that their employers - whether state agencies or private firms
- concealed wrongdoing of some type, and further that the
whistle-blower suffered retribution for disclosing the wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Firmly stated in the 1998 case and in some others concerning the
whistle-blower law was the conclusion that the state law protects
employees who expose problems affecting the broader public
interest.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday the Supreme Court went further, saying the law
could also help employees win lawsuits when they suffer retribution
even though no factors such as toxic pollution, dangerous products
or consumer fraud were at issue.
</P>
<P>
   The case involved a former TRW employee, Frank Roach, who
specialized in corporate security at the firm's division handling
military Pentagon contracts. He was slated to take over the firm's
civilian office at Fort Monmouth when he was laid off in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   TRW lawyers claimed Roach was dismissed for poor performance,
but Roach charged he had been targeted after reporting internally
that two executives were set to get kickbacks for a business deal.
Roach said the firm took no action on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   A jury in 1997 awarded Roach about $700,000, but TRW appealed
claiming the nature of the controversy did not affect the public
interest, and so the whistle-blower law did not apply. An appeals
court agreed the law did not apply to Roach's case and threw out
the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Associate Justice Peter Verniero, writing for a unanimous court
in an opinion released Wednesday, reversed the lower court and
reinstated the jury award to Roach's family.
</P>
<P>
   ''In essence, the appellate division held that all
(whistle-blower) violations require a specific showing that the
complained-about activities implicate the public interest,''
Verniero said. ''We disagree.''
</P>
<P>
   Verniero said the law functions when the employee sincerely
believes the infractions he was privy to involved unlawful conduct,
even if over the long-term no state law is actually proven to have
been broken.

<HEADLINE> Show Time Again at Roman Colosseum  </HEADLINE>
By CANDICE HUGHES
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- After nearly 1,500 years, it's showtime again at the
Roman Colosseum. Spectators are bustling into the ancient arena,
performers are fending off stage fright.
</P>
<P>
   But the show this time is supremely civilized: Classical Greek
tragedy instead of gladiators and gore. No howling Roman mobs, no
snarling wild beasts.
</P>
<P>
   The National Theater of Greece's striking production of
''Oedipus Rex'' christens an eight-year restoration of the
Colosseum capped by the replacement of part of the arena's
long-missing floor.
</P>
<P>
   About one-seventh of the original arena's floor space is now
covered, leaving open the vast subterranean labyrinth that once
housed animals, gladiators, sets and props.
</P>
<P>
   The stage makes it possible for the first time in centuries to
stand where gladiators once stood, gazing up at the towering tiers
of the ancient amphitheater.
</P>
<P>
   Even the cast and crew of Oedipus were a bit awe-struck by the
astonishing venue.
</P>
<P>
   ''This grandeur, this strength! The strength of the Romans,''
Jenny Gaitanapoulou, the veteran Cypriot actress who plays Jocasta,
the mother/wife of Oedipus, exclaimed at dress rehearsal Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oepidus Rex'' began a three-day run Wednesday, the first of a
trilogy of Sophocles' tragedies in the Colosseum this summer. It
will be followed by ''Antigone'' and the opera ''Oedipus,'' an
adaptation of the play ''Oedipus in Colonus.''
</P>
<P>
   For many people involved in the Sophocles project, the
performances are a way of infusing the ancient killing ground with
a new spirit. Culture Minister Giovanna Melandri said the trilogy
brings the Colosseum back to life, but ''not for cruelty. It's for
art.''
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of lives were sacrificed in the arena to
entertain the bloodthirsty Roman crowds and it could take more than
eight summer nights of Sophocles to banish the ghosts. But people
like Oedipus star Grigoris Valtinos have faith in their art.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a victory for the theater to play in this place,'' the
actor said at dress rehearsal. ''This place is full of blood. But I
hope to fill it with soul.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear whether the Colosseum will become a regular
performance venue. Melandri called the Sophocles series an
''experiment.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts will have to assess the wear and tear, she said. And
even more important is the unique nature of the place; some
preservationists are already complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want to overuse it,'' Melandri said in an interview.
''We want to keep it special.''
</P>
<P>
   A symbol of the Roman Empire's magnificence and might, the
Colosseum was inaugurated in A.D. 80 with immense fanfare: 100 days
of gladiatorial combat that cost thousands of lives. The last games
were in 523.
</P>
<P>
   It is an enormous structure, even to modern eyes: more than two
football fields long, 1,730 feet in circumference, 164 feet high.
In ancient times it had 80 arched entrances and could seat at least
50,000 people. The oval arena was 29,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   The new stage is 4,305 square feet and audience space is limited
-- room for about 700 people, many of them standing.
</P>
<P>
   Director Vassilis Papavasiliou unites ancient and modern in this
production, which travels to New York's City Center in October,
then to Mexico, Chile, Brazil and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Against the magnificent backdrop of the Colosseum ruins, the
cast plays out Oedipus' tragedy in modern Greek among dozens of
ghostly plaster figures, many in contemporary dress.
</P>
<P>
   Hobbling on ebony canes, an equally ghostly, white-robed chorus
fades in and out of this forest of silent witnesses, its words and
the sparse modern music urging the drama on to its inexorable
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   The Colosseum was designed for blood sports and leaves a lot to
be desired as a theater. Papavasiliou said acoustics were a problem
and microphones had to be positioned at strategic points on the
stage.
</P>
<P>
   Modern Rome compounded the problem with an urban symphony of
honking horns, airplanes overhead and ambulances wailing in the
night.
</P>
<P>
   But, as one of the stars said, you don't play the Colosseum
every day. A little background noise, a smallish stage and crummy
acoustics are a small sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   ''You experience it once in a lifetime,'' Gaitanapoulou said, as
she prepared to transform herself into Jocasta and stride onstage.

<HEADLINE> Albright Eyes NKorea Minister Talks  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP)-- President Clinton intends to quiz Russian
President Vladimir Putin at the G-8 economic summit on whether
Russia was ready to help convert North Korea's missile program into
a civilian satellite program, a senior U.S. official said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   And Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will pursue North
Korea's foreign minister next week in Thailand on whether his
country is open to such a satellite program with the cooperation of
the United States, Russia and possibly other nations, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin may have been hinting he was interested in such a joint
program when he paid the first-ever visit by a Russian president to
communist North Korea on Wednesday. The Russian president met with
leader Kim Jong Il and said afterward that North Korea's program
was meant for peaceful purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Albright hopes to see Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun while she is
in Bangkok, Thailand, next week attending a meeting of the foreign
ministers of the member countries of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations, a State Department official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The high-level contact is only one of several the United States
will have with a country it once denounced as being headed by a
''rogue regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the improvement in relations, the anti-missile defense
program under U.S. consideration is designed to protect against
what Albright and other American officials say is a North Korean
threat.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said in June she might use the talks with a senior
North Korean official to try extend a freeze in North Korea's
nuclear weapons program and to curb the spread of North Korean
missile technology.
</P>
<P>
   Press accounts of Putin's remarks in North Korea puzzled U.S.
officials, who were uncertain if they should interpret them as an
intent to contribute to a positive solution of the North Korean
situation.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 44; Nasdaq Falls 122  </HEADLINE>
By DUNSTAN PRIAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices tumbled Wednesday, as disappointed
investors vented their wrath on a slew of technology companies
whose second-quarter financial results fell short of high
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index fell 121.54 to close at 4,055.63. The
primary catalyst for the selloff was disappointing quarterly
results from three technology bellwethers -- Microsoft, Intel and
Apple.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 43.84 at 10,696.08,
according to preliminary calculations. Broader stock indicators
were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 11.78 at
1,481.96.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft fell $5.375 to $73.125 after the software giant
reported that second quarter sales were stagnant, about equal to
the same period a year ago. Earnings were up for the quarter, but
the increase was attributed to investment income rather than
profits from sales.
</P>
<P>
   Intel dropped $4.875 to $138.125 after barely beating Wall
Street's expectations for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   And investors punished Apple after the computer maker beat Wall
Street's earnings expectations by a mere penny. Apple reported
second quarter profits of 45 cents a share. Wall Street had
predicted 44 cents. Apple's stock was off $4.562 at $52.688.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the Super Bowl syndrome. The reality never lives up to
the hype,'' said John Eade, director of research at Argus Research
in New York. ''The Nasdaq rallied last week ahead of earnings, but
now that companies are reporting, investors are taking some
profits.''
</P>
<P>
   One technology company bucked the trend, however. IBM reported
better-than-expected results after the markets closed Wednesday,
and investors promptly bid up the company's stock up $4.563 to
$107.875 in after-hours trading.
</P>
<P>
   The broad falloff in blue-chip stocks came despite a positive
earnings reports from Citigroup, the largest U.S. financial
services company, which said its profits rose 23 percent over the
same period a year ago. Citigroup's stock rose $1.312 to $68.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on the Nasdaq, investors began showing they are fed up
with Internet companies whose losses continue to grow. For example,
Veritas Software Corp. shares fell $15.313 to $112.25 after the
maker of data storage-management software said its second-quarter
losses were greater than a year ago, widening to $172.3 million
from $162.3 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   And Commerce One's stock was down $11.25 to $55.313 after the
e-commerce software company said its second-quarter losses widened
to 28 cents a share from 11 cents in the year-earlier quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The downturn on the Nasdaq extended a selloff that began
Tuesday, which occurred despite encouraging news on inflation. The
Labor Department reported that consumer inflation -- excluding
skyrocketing fuel costs -- had risen just 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said it's anyone's guess as to whether the Federal
Reserve Board will raise interest rates or leave them stable at its
next meeting Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of uncertainty out there,'' said Argus
Research's Eade.
</P>
<P>
   Investors across both the stock and bond markets have been
anxiously awaiting testimony Thursday by Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan before a Senate committee. Many investors have
chosen to remain on the sidelines until Greenspan's testimony is
over.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.1 billion shares,
down from Tuesday's.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 8.42 at 527.86.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.23 percent.
Germany's DAX index was down 0.54 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was
up 0.23 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 0.30 percent.

<HEADLINE> NJ case could set some standards for lawsuits against online critics </HEADLINE>
By DERRICK HENRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - National free speech advocates are watching
a New Jersey case in which a company is suing four unidentified
online critics and wants an Internet portal to surrender their
names.
</P>
<P>
   Dendrite International Inc., based in Morristown, in a lawsuit
claims four people who posted messages on an Internet bulletin
board were revealing company secrets and were crossing the line
into libel.
</P>
<P>
   Dendrite, a leading supplier of sales-support services for the
pharmaceutical and consumer packaged goods industries, filed the
lawsuit in May.
</P>
<P>
   It alleges false statements about the company were made by three
of the defendants, and that two who identified themselves as
company employees violated their contracts to not negatively
criticize the company.
</P>
<P>
   The company also claims three of the defendants published secret
company information.
</P>
<P>
   The company has requested that Internet portal Yahoo! release
the names of the four, identified in court papers as ''ajcazz,''
''gacbar,'' ''xxplrr'' and ''implementor extrodinaire.''
</P>
<P>
   But free speech advocates say Dendrite's allegations in the
lawsuit first have to be proved in court before any names are
released.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo! and other companies in past have given out names of its
members without notifying them when served with a subpoena. But
Yahoo! said it has since changed that policy.
</P>
<P>
   The company now sends e-mails to its members, notifying them of
the requests and gives them 15 days to object.
</P>
<P>
   Free speech experts were pleased that Superior Court Judge
Kenneth MacKenzie on June 20 ordered Yahoo! to post Dendrite's
intentions on the same electronic billboard used by the defendants.
The posting went up June 23.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very innovative thing that the judge has done,'' said
Paul Levy, an attorney for the Public Citizens Litigation Group,
which last week filed a friend-of-the-court brief advocating that
Yahoo! not be ordered to identify the four people unless Dendrite
proves its allegations in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's a good indication that he (MacKenzie) recognized
the problems with some of these cases,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such lawsuits began surfacing about two years ago ''and
unfortunately have become a very popular tactic on part of publicly
traded companies that want to stop public criticism,'' said David
Sobel, general counsel with the Electronic Privacy Information
Center, based in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The organization, founded in 1994, is a nonprofit research group
that examines privacy and free speech issues on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   While the Internet has given people a better ability to speak
out, ''it also gives the companies themselves the ability to smoke
those people out and intimidate them into silence,'' Sobel said.
</P>
<P>
   Sobel said past cases have shown that what defendants said have
falls within the range of fair comment. He also said it appears a
majority of the lawsuits have only the goal of getting the identity
of a person, then dropping the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's pretty rare you actually get a ruling,'' Levy said.
</P>
<P>
   Dendrite's lawsuit says one person posted a message complaining
about pressure from management to be productive. The lawsuit also
claims another person said Dendrite employees were leaving the
company in droves.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer representing ''xxplrr'' said he last week filed papers
opposing Dendrite's lawsuit and the company's request for the
names.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that there's a right to maintain one's anonymity,
provided one hasn't done anything wrong in regard to the
Internet,'' said Eugene Reynolds, who practices in Morris Plains.
''I believe we're correct.''
</P>
<P>
   Dendrite officials declined to comment Wednesday afternoon. They
didn't immediately return calls about the case. Michael Vogel, an
attorney for the company, also on Wednesday said he wasn't
authorized to talk about the case because it is pending.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing in the New Jersey case is scheduled July 28 and
follows two recent cases.
</P>
<P>
   In May, a Florida judge ruled a Fort Lauderdale businessman
could learn who wrote messages about him on Yahoo! and America
Online. That ruling is under appeal. In Pennsylvania, a judge has
filed a lawsuit to determine who is operating a Web site that's
critical of him.

<HEADLINE> Family fights to keep pet that state says is endangered  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD PYLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - If Roman Flikshtein had known Ceropithecus diana
was an endangered species, he'd never have plunked down $4,500 for
the furry little monkey his family calls Cookie. Now, five years
later, Cookie is even more endangered: the state wants to take her
away.
</P>
<P>
   Court rulings, affirming that having such a pet violates federal
and state law, means the gray-and-brown primate with the absurdly
long tail could be packed off soon to an animal rescue center at
the Detroit zoo.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Flikshteins said they're not sure what to do
if that knock on the door comes. To refugees who fled the Soviet
Union in the early 1980s, the very idea is disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like the United States, except for this. This is unfair,''
Inna Flikshtein sobbed outside the house in Manhattan Beach, a
wealthy Brooklyn enclave of Russian immigrants. She added, ''I'm
ready to go to jail, but I won't give my baby up.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Cookie is part of our family,'' said daughter Michelle, 13.
''She's depressed because she sees us crying. If she has to leave
us, she will die.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to prevent any of that, the Flikshteins have appealed to
whoever might listen: a letter to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, faxes and
calls to Senate candidates Rick Lazio and Hillary Rodham Clinton,
messages left at media outlets.
</P>
<P>
   ''They all said, 'We'll get back to you.' Nobody was
interested,'' said Roman Flikshtein.
</P>
<P>
   That changed after their story appeared on the front page of The
New York Times. Before noon, television crews hovered in the
driveway, a morning talk show called, and Roman's cellular phone
buzzed like a hive of killer bees.
</P>
<P>
   A car screeched to a halt on Girard street, and neighbor Melanie
Salkin jumped out to offer support. ''I see the monkey all the
time,'' she gushed. ''She's special. The children all adore her.''
</P>
<P>
   Curious about the attention, Cookie snatched a tuft of a
photographer's hair, then sat on Michelle's knee to munch carrots,
string beans and fruit.
</P>
<P>
   The six-year-old guener, or diana monkey, has a cage in the
living room, watches television and bathes with water and lemon,
Michelle said.
</P>
<P>
   Flikshtein, who owns a Queens dental laboratory, bought Cookie
at a pet store in 1995. To the animal lover who always wanted a
monkey, the exotic-looking African simian seemed perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Pet store owner Dennis Borghese said the monkey came from a
Florida breeder. ''It was bred in captivity. It wasn't imported,
and it wasn't from the black market,'' he said. ''I felt that it
needed nurturing, and I wanted it to have a good home.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men say they were unaware at the time that the species was
endangered.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't come up until two years ago, when - according to
Flikshtein - a professional animal handler who coveted Cookie sent
an anonymous letter to the state Department of Environmental
Conservation, reporting that a diana monkey, kept as a family pet
in Brooklyn, had bitten someone.
</P>
<P>
   The Flikshteins said the latter allegation was false, but it
triggered the chain of official actions.
</P>
<P>
   Flikshtein applied for a DEC permit to keep the monkey - and was
rejected. ''The state does not issue licenses to keep endangered or
threatened species as pets,'' said the June 11, 1999 letter signed
by DEC biologist Patrick Martin.
</P>
<P>
   If Flikshtein had listed the animal as used for educational
purposes, the result might have been different, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Borghese said he thought the permit would be issued and ''that
would be the end of it,'' but was cited for selling endangered
animals, and paid a $5,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   The Flikshteins, meanwhile, went to court. Last Sept. 23, Queens
State Supreme Court Justice Arthur Lonschein denied them a hearing.
Two weeks ago, that ruling was upheld by an appellate court,
opening the way for state officials to take Cookie.
</P>
<P>
   DEC attorney Gail Hintz told a newspaper that the agency did not
want to seize Cookie, but ''it depends on how cooperative the
family is.'' She did not immediately return calls.
</P>
<P>
   Flikshtein said he has no problem with the law being enforced to
discourage illicit traffic in endangered species, but wondered why
it should apply to a monkey born in captivity and since spayed, so
that it cannot reproduce anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll go anywhere, do anything, to save Cookie,'' he said. ''I
can't imagine being without her. I just pray it's not going to
happen.''

<HEADLINE> After donor refunds, Giuliani still has $3.8 million  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Mayor Rudolph Giuliani refunded $2.8 million
to donors since dropping out of the New York Senate race against
Hillary Rodham Clinton. But he still has $3.8 million in the bank,
campaign finance filings released Wednesday show.
</P>
<P>
   The filings also show the Giuliani camp continued to spend
heavily on mass mailings in the weeks after he announced he had
prostate cancer and leading up to his withdrawal from the contest.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani spokesman Bruce Teitelbaum said Wednesday the mayor
still has not decided what to do with the remaining cash.
Teitelbaum said the campaign has been consumed with refunding all
the money it was required to, and was only now turning its
attention to the cash remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Republican candidates are hoping they will get their hands on at
least some of the leftovers. The Giuliani campaign is barred from
giving more than the $2,000 limit to GOP Rep. Rick Lazio, who
replaced the mayor in the race against the first lady. But he could
give it to Republican Party organizations which could then spend it
on Lazio's behalf and on ads attacking the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani could also keep the money to use in a future election,
such as a run for governor, although he has said he intends to
complete his term as mayor.
</P>
<P>
   State Republican Party spokesman Dan Allen said the mayor has
been ''very helpful so far.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani campaign took the unique step of sending refunds to
donors in the form of cashier checks, which could be easily
endorsed by the donor and re-contributed to Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   The refunds also included a written plea from the mayor urging
donors to send the money to Lazio as well as a stamped,
pre-addressed envelope to get it there, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did everything we possibly could to make it very easy for
them to turn right around and donate the money to Rick,''
Teitelbaum said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The refunds were mailed out in late June so it was unclear yet
how many would reroute their donations to Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani camp was required by election to return donations
designated for the general election, but could keep contributions
earmarked for the primary.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe they will have time now to sit down and decide what
they're going to do with this remaining money,'' Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   The filing released Wednesday also showed that the Giuliani
campaign spent a hefty $6.6 million during April, May and June.
That is more had been spent in any other filing period and it came
even though the mayor withdrew from the race on May 19, about
halfway through the three-month filing period. All total, the
mayor's Senate campaign spent $12.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign spent $1.8 million on direct mail fund raising
efforts in the weeks after Giuliani announced he had prostate
cancer, seeming evidence that he was still serious about the Senate
bid even after the diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   Such direct mail efforts - many to conservative donors who
despise the Clintons - were hugely successful in fueling Giuliani's
$19 million campaign warchest.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has collected more than $18.6 million since she began
running for the Senate and reported more than $6.9 million still
left, as of the end of June. Lazio has raised more than $8.54
million and has $6.2 million still in his campaign account.

<HEADLINE> With sales pending, Nabisco profits rise in second quarter  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PARSIPPANY, N.J. (AP) - Profits rose in the second quarter for
the nation's biggest cookie and cracker maker, Nabisco Holdings
Corp., and the company that owns a controlling stake in it, the
companies reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The report comes less than a month after deals to sell both
companies to concerns with tobacco interests were announced.
</P>
<P>
   Nabisco Holdings, which makes Ritz crackers, Oreo cookies and
Planters nuts, earned $98 million, or 37 cents a share, in the
three months ended June 30, up 54 percent from the 24 cents, or $65
million a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The results beat by 5 cents a share the estimates of analysts
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding special items, the 1999 second-quarter results were 28
cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Nabisco Holdings closed at $52.188, up 25 cents, or
0.5 percent, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide sales for the second quarter rose 12 percent to $2.26
billion, compared to $2.02 billion a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nabisco Group Holdings Corp., which owns 80.6 percent of Nabisco
Holdings, earned 23 cents a share, or $112 million, up 28 percent
from 18 cents a share in the same 1999 period. Results from both
years exclude discontinued operations and a loss on early bond
redemption, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   First Call/Thomson Financial did not have an estimate for
Nabisco Group second-quarter results.
</P>
<P>
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Nabisco Group shares
closed at $25.438, up 6.3 cents, or 0.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris Cos. Inc. is paying $14.9 billion in cash for
Nabisco Holdings. After that sale is completed, R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco has agreed to pay $9.8 billion for Nabisco Group. Both
sales are to close in the fourth quarter, Nabisco spokesman Henry
A. Sandbach said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sales in the company's U.S. Biscuit division were up 4 percent
from a year ago to $936 million, boosted by new products such as
Cafe Cremes cookies, Mini Chips Ahoy!, Baseball Ritz, and a new
flavor of Newtons, Tropical Strawberry-Kiwi, as well as increased
market share, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The Nabisco Foods division reported a 34 percent increase in
sales, to $733 million, led by sales increases in peanuts, mixed
nuts, and Life Savers candies.
</P>
<P>
   International sales rose 2 percent to $589 million. The figure
would have been 5 percent, excluding unfavorable foreign currency
exchange, the company said.

<HEADLINE> BC-NY--US-Diamonds, 2nd Ld-Writethru,670  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Most diamond buyers think about cost, cut and
carats - not political correctness.
</P>
<P>
   But the diamond industry has now thrown in the moral question:
Was a gem mined amid a brutal African war fueled by sales of the
shiny stones that stand for love - and luxury - in America?
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone, of course, is buying the challenge issued
Wednesday by the World Diamond Congress in Antwerp, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want a diamond. Where it comes from, how it got here, I
don't really care,'' said Christine Sabo of Marlboro, N.J.,
shopping Wednesday in Manhattan's Diamond District for ''a band to
update my wedding ring.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It may sound self-serving, but it wouldn't make a
difference,'' added Sabo, eyeing a lineup of rings in a window on
West 47th Street. ''If I like it, I'll buy it - if the price is
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Price was not the hot topic this week in Antwerp, where 85
percent of the world's rough diamonds are traded.
</P>
<P>
   International diamond officials announced strict new measures
Wednesday to clamp down on the trade in ''conflict diamonds'' used
to pay for wars in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The measures include a certification system to track rough
diamonds from the time they're mined, as well as penalties against
dealers who break United Nations embargoes on diamond sales by
rebels in Angola and Sierra Leone. The move comes in response to
charges that several African groups have financed bloody civil wars
using proceeds from illicit diamond sales.
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest diamond company, De Beers, called on its
customers to boycott the glitter sold by the rebels. However, it
wasn't until last October that DeBeers announced it would no longer
buy Angolan diamonds not accompanied by a certificate of origin.
</P>
<P>
   ''All those years DeBeers was mining in Angola, it was OK,''
said Nektalov.
</P>
<P>
   In some American jewelry stores, reality - and price - is
quickly undercutting the Antwerp ideal.
</P>
<P>
   ''As long as I give a seller a check and he gives me an invoice
- it's legal,'' says Leon Nektalov, whose Leon's Diamonds on 47th
Street is lined with engagement rings set with stones from Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The certified gemologist comes from four generations of diamond
experts in the former Soviet republic of Uzbekhistan; his father
ran a diamond-cutting factory there.
</P>
<P>
   Nektalov doesn't believe the diamond industry is in a position
to enforce the new rules. ''It's next to impossible to trace a
rough diamond,'' he said. ''As a merchant, how will I know if it's
from Africa or Brazil?''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he said, he knows of a major diamond merchant in
Angola ''who also is strong in Russia.'' And diamonds in the rough
coming out of mines in large batches can easily be swapped and sold
together.
</P>
<P>
   ''No gemologist could tell you for sure which is which,'' said
Nektalov. ''How are they going to prove for sure where it came
from? It would take a lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time an illegally exported diamond reaches a retail buyer
with a certificate, it often passes through a dozen wholesale
hands. In addition, the world supply of already mined diamonds runs
into the tens of billions of dollars that will last for years to
come.
</P>
<P>
   But on Fifth Avenue, Tiffany &AMP; Co. is adamant about keeping its
stock free of the war-tainted diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the upscale jeweler said it has ''a zero
tolerance policy toward them. ... We are doing everything feasible
to bar conflict diamonds from our inventory.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of not buying an engagement ring paid with human lives
sure sounds like ''a good cause'' to Peter Georges, an executive
with a high-tech Silicon Valley firm.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wouldn't buy a diamond ring that comes from a place where
people are suffering or getting killed for it!'' he said, ripping
open his flowery shirt to show off a chest tattoo that reads
''Takayo'' - his girlfriend's name.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to return home to San Jose, Calif., to propose to her
bearing a 2.01-carat, platinum-set stone that runs into five
figures.
</P>
<P>
   And Georges is confident their union will be graced by a diamond
with a politically correct provenance - from Yakutsk, Russia, with
love.

<HEADLINE> Duma Votes To Override Putin Bill  </HEADLINE>
By ANNA DOLGOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- President Vladimir Putin's plan to tighten control
over Russia's regions advanced Wednesday as the lower house of
parliament approved proposals to reduce the power of governors.
</P>
<P>
   In a 308-88 vote, the Duma approved one bill under which
regional governors who make up the upper chamber of parliament, or
Federation Council, would be replaced with appointed legislators
and stripped of immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   The Federation Council is to meet next Wednesday to vote on the
bill. Some legislators said the chamber might vote against the
measure. But even if that occurs, the measure will likely be
enacted because the Duma can override the upper house with a
two-thirds vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''In my view, the ... bill deserves to be defeated,'' said
liberal Duma lawmaker Sergei Yushenkov. ''It turns the Federation
Council into a chamber of puppets.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federation Council's duties include approving presidential
proposals on the introduction of martial law and states of
emergency, authorizing the deployment of Russian troops abroad,
appointing Constitutional and Supreme Court justices, and
appointing and dismissing the prosecutor-general.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the important functions invested with the Federation
Council, turning it into a puppet chamber is extremely dangerous,''
Yushenkov said.
</P>
<P>
   The reshuffle of the Federation Council is to be completed by
Jan. 1, 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The second bill approved Wednesday would allow Putin to dismiss
regional governors if a court determines them to have violated the
law, and it would allow Putin to suspend governors if the
prosecutor-general charges them with a serious crime.
</P>
<P>
   The Duma vote of 363-35 on Wednesday, with eight abstentions,
technically overrode the Federation Council's veto of that bill,
meaning the measure now only needs to be signed by Putin to become
law.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will naturally be signed,'' said the presidential
representative in the Duma, Alexander Kotenkov.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that bill opens the way for summary removals of
governors who defy the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   ''This bill officially attributes political functions to the
prosecutor-general's office,'' said reformist lawmaker Boris
Nemtsov. ''A road has been opened wide for unbridled arbitrariness
by prosecutors.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin argues that tightening central control over the regions is
needed to fix Russia's economic problems, and to stop alleged
disregard for federal laws in some of the provinces.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Russia's governors have been increasing their
powers, while the federal government weakened. Wealthier regions
often refuse to share revenues with the central government, and
some governors have turned into authoritarian rulers of their
territories.
</P>
<P>
   A prominent critic of Putin's plan, tycoon Boris Berezovsky,
officially resigned from the Duma on Wednesday, before the votes.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was protesting both Putin's plans to rein in the
regions and the Kremlin's alleged attempts to destroy big business.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, the Duma passed tax reforms pushed by Putin,
including establishing a 13-percent flat income tax to replace the
country's progressive tax. Putin says reforming the country's
labyrinthine tax regulations will boost revenue collection and
encourage investors.
</P>
<P>
   The tax measure now goes to the Federation Council and some
legislators predicted the upper house will reject them.

<HEADLINE> Senate Accused of Racism on Judges  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican-controlled Senate's record of
holding up President Clinton's minority and female judicial
appointments demonstrates racist and sexist tendencies in that
body, the Congressional Black Caucus charged Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   As of last November, the Senate had confirmed 42 percent of
Clinton's white nominees but less than 18 percent of his black
nominees, the caucus said. Also, during last year's congressional
session, senators considering black nominees took two months longer
than they did considering whites, and 65 days longer considering
women than they did men, the caucus said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm saddened to make these accusations but I will make them.
The United States Senate has acted racistly and with sexism,'' said
Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The caucus wants the Senate Judiciary Committee to act on four
federal appellate nominations, James Wynn, Jr., of North Carolina,
Kathleen McRee of Michigan, Johnnie Rawlinson of Nevada and Roger
Gregory of Virginia, before the end of the session. They also want
three district judges approved: Legrome Davis of Pennsylvania,
Rhonda Fields of Washington, D.C. and Ken Simon of Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   The caucus especially is pushing Gregory for a 4th Circuit
position, saying no black has ever been appointed to the circuit
covering South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia
and Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   The 4th Circuit, based in Richmond, Va., has the largest black
population of any federal judicial circuit. Last year, the five
states were about 22 percent black. Also, the seat Gregory has been
nominated for has been vacant for more than a decade, and North
Carolina has had no representation on the court since the death of
Samuel Ervin III in September.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., has blocked three black court
nominees from North Carolina for that seat in the last seven years.
Under Senate rules, a single member can block a judicial nominee
from his home state.
</P>
<P>
   Helms has long contended that the 15-seat court is functioning
effectively despite its four vacancies, and that his opposition to
new nominees has nothing to do with race.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, also
has rejected the claim that race plays a role when judges are
appointed.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch spokeswoman Jeanne Lapatto said that of the nominations
Clinton has made since January, 59 percent of minority nominees and
65 percent of female nominees have been approved. White males were
approved at a 64 percent rate, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''More women and minorities have been approved under Senator
Hatch than any other time,'' Lapatto said. She also noted that
Rawlinson's nomination will come before the committee on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory is from Virginia and Helms cannot block his nomination.
Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va., said he didn't expect their senators,
Republican John Warner and Democrat Charles Robb, to block Gregory.
''There should be no procedural impediments,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Rep. Mel Watt, D-N.C., said his state should get each
of the vacancies on the court because of its size. But, ''if we
can't get a North Carolinian on the court, if we can't get an
African-American North Carolinian on the court, we need to at least
get one African-American from somewhere on that court,'' he said.
''This court needs to be integrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Caucus Chairman Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., dismissed insinuations that
GOP senators were only blocking judges in hopes presidential
candidate George W. Bush will win and nominate Republican judges
instead.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this was something occurring in just the last six months, I
would call it politics,'' he said. ''But the seat that we're
talking about has been vacant for 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Holmes Norton, congressional delegate from the District
of Columbia, said the number of confirmed minority judges proves
their point. ''The proof is in the data,'' she said. ''We're not
here making racial accusations for things we have not proved.''

<HEADLINE> N.J. charges American Honda Finance Corp. overcharged on returned cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - The state charged Wednesday that an auto
leasing company cheated customers by overcharging for ''excessive
wear and damage'' on returned vehicles, denied them a chance to
dispute the charges and failed to promptly return security
deposits.
</P>
<P>
   American Honda Finance Corp. violated the state's Consumer
Protection Leasing Act and the Consumer Fraud Act, according to a
lawsuit filed by the state Division of Consumer Affairs in state
Superior Court for Essex County.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in Torrance, Calif., is a wholly owned
subsidiary of American Honda Motor Co., a unit of Tokyo-based Honda
Motor Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer Affairs filed the lawsuit after receiving more than 20
complaints about Honda since 1997, agency spokeswoman Genene W.
Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   A Honda spokesman, Art Garner, said the company could not
comment on specifics since it had not yet seen the lawsuit, but
said its practice is to comply with all laws.

<HEADLINE> Accused of sex abuse, twins indicted on child porn charges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KINGSTON, N.Y. (AP) - Twin brothers already charged with
sexually abusing young boys were indicted Wednesday on charges they
photographed and videotaped some of the abuse and possessed other
pornographic images.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Jason and Mark Vogt now extends into Columbia
and Rensselaer counties, said Ulster County District Attorney
Donald A. Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Vogt was indicted Wednesday on three counts of possessing
material depicting a sexual performance by a child and three counts
of promoting sexual performance by a child. Jason Vogt faces 10
counts, five counts of possession and five counts of promotion of a
sexual performance involving a child.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the 22-year-old twins from Ancram, Columbia
County, had photographs, videotapes and computer images of children
involved in sex acts with other children and with adults. Some of
the images depict the brothers engaged in sex acts with children,
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the images were downloaded from the Internet, Williams
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Vogt faces additional charges because he individually
possessed some images in his home computer and in his car, Williams
said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said investigators, under the direction of Sr. Inv.
Jimmy McCoy of the county's Family Violence Unit, have identified
three victims, including the latest who lived in Rensselaer County
when the alleged abuse occurred
</P>
<P>
   In March, the brothers were indicted on charges of sodomy,
sexual abuse, using a child in a sexual performance and possessing
a sexual performance by a child, all felonies.
</P>
<P>
   The pair is being held in Ulster County Jail and will likely be
arraigned on the new charges next week, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach William R.S. Myers, an attorney representing
one of the men, were unsuccessful.

<HEADLINE> Charged Contractor, Ohio Rep Linked  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- A contractor has been charged with obstruction
of justice, perjury and witness tampering involving work done for
an Ohio congressman facing a corruption investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Tuesday grand jury indictment lists a public official and
doesn't name Rep. James A. Traficant Jr., D-Ohio. But an attorney
for the contractor, A. David Sugar, said Traficant is the official
in question. Traficant himself has publicly disclosed that he is
under investigation and expects to be indicted.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar, 51, is the first person to be charged in the federal
corruption investigation of Traficant, The Plain Dealer of
Cleveland reported.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar is accused of obstructing justice by directing a secretary
to falsify bills after FBI agents asked about work his company did
on Traficant's farm near Youngstown. Investigators are trying to
determine if Sugar and other contractors worked for free or for
reduced rates to influence the congressman, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar's attorney, Patrick D'Angelo, said his client did nothing
wrong and received no favors from Traficant.
</P>
<P>
   He said Sugar's company poured a small amount of concrete at the
farm and was paid for the work. Sugar's business usually does
underground utility work.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar could not be reached for comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Traficant's office doesn't dispute D'Angelo's identification of
the congressman in the indictment, spokesman Paul Marcone said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The congressman is defending himself and will continue to
defend himself,'' Marcone said. ''He's sorry about what happened to
Mr. Sugar. In his opinion, Dave Sugar is a good man who has done
nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Traficant has repeatedly said he expects to be indicted because
of his suspected ties to organized crime. He denies any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The perjury charge said Sugar lied during his testimony before
the grand jury on May 23. The witness tampering charge alleged that
Sugar told his secretary to misrepresent facts to the FBI.

<HEADLINE> Russia Debt Rescheduling Barred  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted Wednesday to bar the
rescheduling or forgiving of Russian debt until Russia shuts down
its intelligence listening post in Lourdes, Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters said it made no sense to give Russia debt relief when
it is pouring billions of dollars into an operation that props up
the Havana government while eavesdropping on America's military,
companies and private citizens.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration opposes the legislation, arguing that
Russia, like the United States, needs intelligence facilities to
monitor and verify arms control agreements. Many Democrats
opponents of the bill said it was a continuance of a 40-year-old
failed policy of trying to isolate Cuba. The bill passed 275-146.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers said Russia leases the Lourdes facility from Cuba for
up to $300 million a year and has spent more than $3 billion in
recent years to operate and modernize the satellite station used to
intercept U.S. telephone calls and computer communications. They
cited reports that Lourdes was used to intercept U.S. strategic
information during the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   It is similar to having a foreign aircraft carrier ''bristling
with satellites'' sitting off American shores, said House
intelligence committee chairman Porter Goss, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   It also underscores, said bill sponsor Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen,
R-Fla., ''the continuing relation between the Russian intelligence
service and the Cuban tyranny.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would prohibit the United States, as long as the
Lourdes facility is operating, from participating in multinational
agreements to reschedule payments on Soviet-era debts. Under an
agreement reached with Russia's creditor nations last August, the
United States is to refinance nearly $500 million in Soviet-era
debt.
</P>
<P>
   An amendment added by the International Relations Committee
gives the president the authority to waive the ban if he feels it
is in the national interest.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has yet to take up similar legislation, but Senate
Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C., has moved
to block the refinancing package to protest the Russian military
crackdown in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic opponents of the bill referred to the
administration's position that, while it has some concerns about
Lourdes, both the United States and Russia need facilities to
verify arms control agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically the administration is telling us to butt out of
their ability to negotiate in the best interest of our country,''
said Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's Rep. Sam Gejdenson, the top Democrat on the
International Relations Committee, said the real purpose of the
bill's backers is to put ''one more nail in Fidel Castro's coffin.
For 40 years we have tried these plots,'' he said. ''Let's not tie
our Russian policy to a failed policy in Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill number is H.R. 4118

<HEADLINE> Camden man accused of killing aunt charged in second homicide  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - A Camden man who is charged with killing his
aunt in November 1997 was charged Wednesday with another homicide a
month earlier, the prosecutor's office said.
</P>
<P>
   Camden County Prosecutor Lee A. Solomon said Marvin Q. Smith
shot Terron Johnson on Oct. 17, 1997, on a city street. Johnson was
taken to a local hospital, where he died six days later.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 22, was scheduled to be arraigned on the murder charge
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was charged July 2 with killing his aunt, Paula Macklin, a
Camden kindergarten teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Smith argued with his aunt on Nov. 17, 1997, in
her Camden home. The fight escalated, and Smith beat his aunt and
stabbed her with a kitchen knife, according to prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Smith then robbed her house and fled in her 1997 Jeep Cherokee,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Macklin's body was found later that evening by her son and his
girlfriend. The blade was still in Macklin's chest.
</P>
<P>
   Macklin, 44, taught at McGraw School in Camden.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was arrested July 2 by Glassboro police on an unrelated
charge.
</P>
<P>
   He is being held in Camden County Jail in lieu of $300,000 cash
bail.

<HEADLINE> State says Essex man led Bonanno loanshark and gambling racket  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - An Essex County man led a loansharking and
gambling operation there for the New York-based Bonanno crime
family, state authorities charged Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph A. Taormina was arrested and accused of being a ''capo,''
or mob captain, and charged with racketeering, conspiracy,
promoting gambling, bookmaking and money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   He was also charged with receiving stolen property by purchasing
for resale about $200,000 from an undercover investigator with the
state Division of Criminal Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Taormina, 53, of Fairfield, faces up to 70 years in prison if
convicted on all seven counts.
</P>
<P>
   Four other New Jersey men were charged and accused of being
members or associates of the Bonanno crime family.
</P>
<P>
   All were arrested except Louis Ricco. He is serving a 46-month
federal prison term imposed last year after he pleaded guilty to
loanshark charges stemming from the case against John A. ''Junior''
Gotti, the reputed leader of the Gambino mob in the absence of his
father, imprisoned boss John J. Gotti.
</P>
<P>
   Ricco, 71, formerly of Lodi, is reputed to be a capo in the
Gambino crime family but is accused of participating in illegal
gambling and money laundering with the Bonannos, the state said.
</P>
<P>
   Officers searched Taormina's residence as well as his house in
the Chadwick Beach section of Dover Township, Ocean County, and his
1997 Mercedes-Benz.
</P>
<P>
   They also raided a warehouse and office building known as ''The
Coffee Man'' in Eatontown, Monmouth County.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing of note was recovered, said Emily J. Hornaday, a
spokeswoman for the Criminal Justice Division, part of the attorney
general's office.
</P>
<P>
   Also arrested were Paul Mancuso, 33, of Fair Lawn, Bergen
County; Anthony Stropoli, 37, of Old Bridge, Middlesex County; and
John Balsamo, 51, of River Edge, Bergen County.

<HEADLINE> Former ophthalmologist admits defrauding insurers of $500,000  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - A former Manhattan eye doctor admitted
Wednesday he billed Medicare and private insurance companies for
$500,000 for work he did not do over the past 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   In pleading guilty to two mail fraud charges, Miles A. Galin
also admitted he continued to see patients after his license was
revoked in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Galin, 68, who operated East Side Opthalmologists, said he
submitted bills for surgeries and other procedures he did not
perform, using the names and identification numbers of other
doctors without their knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Galin could be ordered to pay $500,000 restitution when
sentenced Oct. 16 by U.S. District Judge William G. Bassler. Each
count carries up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine, but
the actual penalties would be far less, under sentencing
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance fraud is only one of the legal problems facing the
New York City man.
</P>
<P>
   The former doctor already faces a 33-month federal term imposed
in June 1998 following his conviction in California for attempting
to purchase $500,000 worth of Krugerrands, a gold coin issued by
South Africa, with counterfeit checks from a New York investment
bank.
</P>
<P>
   Galin is seeking to delay his surrender in that case, said
Assistant U.S. Attorney Bruce Levy, who is prosecuting the
insurance case.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Galin faces sentencing Sept. 22 in New York, where
he pleaded guilty to two charges of operating without a license.

<HEADLINE> Congressman Focuses on Gore Tape  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore acknowledged Wednesday
that his voice is captured on a videotape of a White House coffee
with donors but dismissed as ''a partisan political attack'' a
Republican congressman's call for a Justice Department
investigation of the matter.
</P>
<P>
   According to Rep. Dan Burton, Gore can be heard suggesting that
Clinton friend and Indonesian businessman James Riady be shown
Democratic TV ads.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would indeed be extraordinary for the vice president to
suggest showing political issue advertisements to an Indonesian
billionaire who lives in Jakarta, Indonesia,'' Burton wrote
Attorney General Janet Reno on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Your Justice Department is completely disinterested in asking
a single question about what appears to be a suggestion by the vice
president to show illegally funded political advertisements to ...
Riady,'' Burton wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said Burton's ''interpretation is a partisan political
attack, coming in the months before the election.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is to be expected and this is not a surprise. ... This
has all been out there for years,'' Gore said on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Riady, who has lived in the United States, was able to give
money legally in U.S. elections. In addition, the ads referred to
in the tape have never been declared illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Riady, one of the central figures in the campaign fund-raising
scandal of 1996, is under criminal investigation by the Justice
Department's campaign finance task force for reimbursing political
donors.
</P>
<P>
   Burton, chairman of the House Government Reform Committee, said
that on a Dec. 15, 1995, tape of a White House coffee with major
political donors, Gore is heard off-camera making the comment, ''We
ought to show Mr. Riady ... some of the ad tapes.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton said the Justice Department has ''chosen to ignore'' the
information about Gore's comment which the congressman supplied the
department ''a very long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Jim Kennedy made light of Burton's letter.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe if Mr. Burton has Oliver Stone as a witness we can truly
get to the bottom of this,'' said Kennedy. Hollywood moviemaker
Stone's ''JFK'' propounded a conspiracy theory for the president's
assassination.
</P>
<P>
   Gore apparently made the comment to a Riady acquaintance, Arief
Wiriadinata of Indonesia, whose donations to the Democratic Party
were returned amid questions about their legality, said Burton.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president has been questioned three times in the
Justice Department probe of fund raising, but has never been asked
about his apparent comment regarding Riady.

<P>
	   JERSEY CITY, N.J. (AP) - A second specially designated ''E-ZPass
Only'' traffic lane was added Wednesday at the approach to the
Holland Tunnel, and a similar approach at the George Washington
Bridge will open in August.
</P>
<P>
   The new lanes, marked on the road surface with a purple stripe
and a white border, will help cars line up in the proper lanes well
before they reach the toll booths.
</P>
<P>
   The Holland Tunnel lane was added on 12th Street in Jersey City
on the New Jersey approach. The George Washington Bridge approach
will be added on the Interstate 95 approach to the upper-level toll
plaza, extending for approximately two miles.
</P>
<P>
   ''E-ZPass use at all Port Authority crossings is rising
dramatically, and we believe these prominently marked traffic lanes
will make the electronic toll collection even more effective in
moving traffic smoothly,'' said Ken Philmus, director of tunnels,
bridges and terminals for the Port Authority of New York and New
Jersey.

aggressive financing programs.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Authorities: Two ecstasy rings busted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Authorities arrested 20 people Wednesday in an
action they said broke up two drug smuggling rings responsible for
selling $20 million worth of ecstasy tablets.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement agents also seized 20 guns, three Mercedes
Benzes, about $230,000 in cash and a Long Island home valued at
$650,000, the U.S. Customs service announced.
</P>
<P>
   They said the arrests spelled the end of two rings that have
together imported more than a million of the psychedelic pills
since 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Furino Jr., 34, of Quogue, and Alex Zelyakovsky, 28, of
Cliffside Park, N.J., allegedly headed the organizations, hiring
couriers to smuggle the pills from the Netherlands in girdles
strapped to their waists.
</P>
<P>
   The Customs Service said in a statement that the two had ties to
traditional and Russian organized crime groups and have been
involved in credit card fraud, insurance fraud, prostitution, money
laundering and the illegal distribution of firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Furino also operated a cocaine distribution business and grew
and sold more than 45 pounds of marijuana in 1997 and 1998, Customs
said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Zelyakovsky once worked for Furino, but
established his own ecstasy smuggling route in 1999 with a partner,
Kevin Schreiber, 29, of Brooklyn. Furino and Zelyakovsky recently
joined forces again to fund a smuggling trip through Finland, the
Customs statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Ecstasy, once prescribed as an appetite suppressant and later
used by psychiatrists to help their patients relax, is a
mind-altering amphetamine that can produce hallucinogenic and
euphoric states.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica Fire Kills 17 Residents  </HEADLINE>
By MARIANELA JIMENEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) -- A fire gutted a nursing home north
of the capital early Wednesday, killing 17 residents -- many blind
or in wheelchairs -- who were trapped in the building.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters were able to rescue 24 of the residents, two of
whom were being treated for serious burns at a local hospital. The
others were brought to a local church.
</P>
<P>
   The fire, which officials believe was sparked by a short circuit
in a television in one of the rooms, ignited the building's wooden
roof and quickly spread to other rooms. The nursing home is located
in the town of Tilaran, 120 miles northwest of the capital of San
Jose.
</P>
<P>
   A security guard on duty notified rescue workers, who heard
screams coming from the building when they arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters had a hard time putting out the blaze because there
were no nearby water sources and strong winds fanned the flames,
said Costa Rican fire chief Hector Monge.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, all of the building's doors were locked and some of
the patients were either blind, in wheelchairs or confined to their
beds.
</P>
<P>
   ''In normal cases, evacuating people takes only three minutes,''
Monge said. ''But because of the circumstances, we couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Police spokeswoman Edith Mora told Radio Reloj that ''the
saddest part was that the ones we rescued tried to go back in to
save their fellow residents.''
</P>
<P>
   Mora said there were no other workers on the premises besides
the lone guard. She said the remainder of the staff work only
during the daytime.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters removed the bodies of the victims, identified as
nine men and eight women.
</P>
<P>
   Police said there were no indications of foul play but that they
would investigate to be sure.
</P>
<P>
   The fire nearly more than half of the nursing home, a cement
one-story building.

<HEADLINE> Feds Asked To Scrutinize Cable Hike  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee
asked federal officials Wednesday to scrutinize cable rate
increases and again raised questions about whether the industry's
prices should be regulated.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., cited an example from his suburban
Chicago district, served by AT&AMP;T's cable systems, where some
subscribers' rates recently increased by 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''My constituents are suffering under these rate increases, and
they need answers,'' Hyde wrote in a letter to the head of the
Federal Communications Commission. He urged the commission to
investigate cable competition in the area and sought advice on
whether cable rate regulation should be reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC stopped regulating most cable TV services in March of
1999, following the directive of a 1996 law. Hyde said he proposed
extending the law before regulation ended, but encountered
opposition from the industry, which also made ''many promises of
good behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I am wondering now if we made a mistake in letting regulation
expire,'' Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups applauded Hyde's move, saying that AT&AMP;T has made
double-digit rate increases in other major markets as well.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Kimmelman of the Consumers Union said he hoped the letter
would ''spur public officials to use whatever tools they have to
protect consumers from price gouging.''
</P>
<P>
   But cable industry executives defended the increases, saying
that the companies are making heavy investments to upgrade their
systems with two-way capabilities to offer Internet services and
are also adding programming to their lineup.
</P>
<P>
   The price per channel is actually decreasing in many of these
cases, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage increase ''really doesn't reflect what we're
adding to our systems,'' said Sarah Duisik, an AT&AMP;T spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Increases in the cost of programming also play a large role,
AT&AMP;T says. For example, in areas like Wheaton, Ill., where the
company raised prices by $2.74, the bulk of the rate increase --
$2.17 -- was attributable to increases in programing prices the
company must pay. Cable executives said the price of sports
programming in particular has driven up their operating costs.
</P>
<P>
   David Beckwith, spokesman for the National Cable Television
Association, said that cable also has a serious competitor in
direct broadcast satellite -- which he said has captured 15 percent
of the market in 32 states.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think that cable remains an excellent value,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> BC-NY--Cayuga Land Claim,0300  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - It may have been federal agents, not state
officials, who bribed Iroquois leaders in the late 18th century as
the state pursued a 64,000-acre land buy, a witness acknowledged
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On the third day of the Cayuga Indian Nation's land claim trial,
Prof. Peter M. Whitely admitted it could have been federal agents
posing as state officials who bribed ranking chiefs of the Iroquois
Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   Whiteley's testimony in U.S. District Court appeared to
contradict what he wrote in a report to federal officials in which
he contended state officials had bribed the Indian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross examination from New York State Assistant Attorney
General Dave Roberts, Whitely testified that an April 12, 1791
letter from War Secretary Henry Knox to New York Gov. George
Clinton contained references to ''inducements'' and ''personal
gifts to a Cayuga chief.''
</P>
<P>
   Whiteley is an expert in America's indigenous societies from
Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   He is the first witness called as the Cayugas attempt to
convince U.S. District Judge Neal McCurn to add up to $1.7 billion
in interest to the $36.9 million awarded the nation by a jury in
February.
</P>
<P>
   A jury in February awarded the Cayugas $36.9 million in damages
for the loss of 64,027 acres of ancestral homelands in Cayuga and
Seneca counties. McCurn ruled in 1994 that New York illegally
acquired the land in 1795 and 1807 by purchasing it from the
Cayugas without the federal government's required approval.
</P>
<P>
   The state says it owes the Cayugas nothing because it dealt
fairly with the nation and that the federal government knew of the
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is expected to last until mid-August.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon-U.N. Team Braves Mines  </HEADLINE>
By HUSSEIN DAKROUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLIDA, Lebanon (AP) -- Lebanese and U.N. officers navigated
through a minefield in southern Lebanon Wednesday to inspect
disputed points along the border with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The team was carrying out the final inspection of the border,
which began Monday after U.N. Middle East envoy Terje Roed-Larsen
informed Lebanese leaders that Israel had made significant efforts
to end frontier violations.
</P>
<P>
   The inspection was suspended at sundown and would resume
Thursday, according to U.N. officers, who had earlier expressed
hope that the mission would be completed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Brig. Gen. Amin Hoteit, head of the Lebanese team, asked for a
mine-clearing operation so the team could approach the border
fence. They have been working to determine if Israel is complying
with the so-called ''blue line,'' a border drawn by U.N.
cartographers last month to confirm the withdrawal of Israeli
troops from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   A U.N. mine-clearing unit of four Polish soldiers -- two wearing
shields and headgear and equipped with minesweeping devices, and
two carrying the U.N. flag -- spray-painted a blue trail to mark the
cleared area.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 minutes later, the inspection team proceeded into the
30-yard deep minefield to reach the fence.
</P>
<P>
   The officers also inspected three more points near the border
between the villages of Blida, 21 miles east of the border town of
Naqoura on the Mediterranean coast, and Meiss el-Jabal. Naqoura
serves as headquarters of the United Nations Interim Force in
Lebanon, a 4,600-member contingent awaiting orders to deploy along
the frontier in southern Lebanon after the verification of the
Israeli withdrawal is completed.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are no problems,'' Hoteit told The Associated Press
during Wednesday's mission. The Lebanese officer declined comment
on whether Israel has rectified the border violations, saying: ''By
working we produce and by talking we waste time.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, however, the group reached a border gate in Houla
that leads to a large chunk of Lebanese territory that had been
annexed by the Israelis to find that it has been restored to
Lebanese sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching out to open the gate that faces the Israeli settlement
of Manara, a relaxed and satisfied Hoteit told AP: ''Opening this
gate is like opening the doors of paradise.''
</P>
<P>
   Brig. Gen. Jim Sreenan, the Irish deputy commander of the U.N.
peacekeepers, said ''many (Israeli) violations had been corrected
since the last two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Lebanese acceptance of the completion of the May 24 Israeli
withdrawal, already verified by the United Nations, would pave the
way for deployment of U.N. peacekeepers and then the Lebanese army
into an area now controlled by Lebanese guerrillas.

<HEADLINE> Princeton University raises $1.14 billion over five years  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) - Princeton University said Wednesday it
has raised a record $1.14 billion over the past five years as part
of a fund-raising effort to commemorate its 250th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   The Anniversary Campaign for Princeton, which began in July
1995, raised money to launch interdisciplinary programs in the
natural and social sciences, engineering and the humanities.
</P>
<P>
   It will also support teaching and research programs, enhance
campus life and expand the school's ability to provide scholarships
to both graduate and undergraduate students.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a specific purpose for every dollar received, and
every dollar will make a difference,'' said university President
Harold T. Shapiro. ''The results of this effort are as provident as
opening Princeton's doors wider to young people, regardless of
background or economic circumstance, and as practical as rewiring
our dormitories, libraries and laboratories for advanced
information technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   The anniversary campaign surpassed its original goal of raising
$750 million in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50,000 alumni, parents and supporters of the Ivy
League school contributed to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The three largest individual contributions came from Hong Kong
businessman and 1958 graduate Gordon Woo ($100 million); chairman
and CEO of Progressive Insurance Co. and 1955 graduate Peter Lewis
($55 million); and investment banker and 1952 graduate Gerhard R.
Andlinger ($25 million).

<HEADLINE> Mideast Peace Talks Falter  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- Israel and the Palestinians swapped charges
of bad-faith bargaining Wednesday as their marathon search for a
settlement of their 52-year-old conflict faltered. Talks stretched
into the night.
</P>
<P>
   A key stumbling point appeared to be the future status of
Jerusalem, which Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat wants to make the
capital of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton shuttled among Arafat, Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak and his own experts on a gloomy, wet day matching the
mood at the Camp David retreat in the Catoctin Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have worked very hard to find a path to an agreement,''
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said late Wednesday afternoon.
''At this point in time, we have not reached that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart signaled that after nine days of talks, time was almost
up, saying Clinton expected to leave early Thursday on his delayed
trip to Japan to meet with the other leaders of the world's
economic powers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met with Arafat even as Lockhart briefed reporters on
the situation. The president had met earlier with Barak. The two
principals in the talks did not meet face to face during the day,
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Arafat were seeking common ground on such contentious
issues as the future of Jerusalem, the fate of 2 million to 4
million Palestinian refugees and their descendants, the size of a
Palestinian state on the West Bank and in Gaza and the number of
Jewish settlements to remain in the territories.
</P>
<P>
   Israel radio and television reported Barak had written to
Clinton complaining that the Palestinians had not gone to Camp
David to negotiate in good faith.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Palestinians arrived at Camp David lacking a true
commitment, and are not ready to have a substantive discussion
about a lasting peace and to make historic decisions,'' Israel
radio quoted a Hebrew translation of the letter. ''Unless there are
last-minute changes, the Palestinians will have to envision the
tragic consequences of an opportunity they missed.''
</P>
<P>
   Hassan Abdel Rahman, who heads the Palestine Liberation
Organization's office in Washington, sought to rebut the prime
minister. He said the Palestinians went to Camp David to achieve a
just and lasting peace that the Israeli and Palestinian people
could live with for generations.
</P>
<P>
   ''This peace does not deal with balance of forces but balance of
interests,'' Rahman told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   He contended that in the talks Israel sought to impose
settlement terms on the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart's briefing covered the peace talks as of late Wednesday
afternoon. He said they expected to keep going until at least
midnight.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think that anyone sees any value in staying on
forever,'' Lockhart said, ''but I don't think there's anyone ...
whether it be Chairman Arafat, Prime Minister Barak or President
Clinton, who wants to leave here without an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Clinton made telephone calls to four other leaders
in the Middle East ''to give them some sense of where we are in
this process.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The last 24 hours have involved very intensive discussions,''
Lockhart said. ''We have worked very hard to find a path to an
agreement. At this point in time we have not reached that.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Clinton would consider the peace effort over when he had
tried every possible avenue and concluded further talks would not
be valuable or constructive.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said the president had received written communications
from Arafat as well as Barak. He did not describe Arafat's letter,
except that it was different in nature and substance from that
Barak's letter complaining that the Palestinians were not
negotiating in good faith.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why they would send letters to Clinton when they were
sitting in talks with him, Lockhart said that was a question for
them, not him.
</P>
<P>
   He said repeatedly that the sessions couldn't keep going as they
have. ''There comes a time when you have to get on with the other
business that's before you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Jerusalem, Barak signaled before and during the summit that
he was willing to give the Palestinians more control over Arab
neighborhoods and to expand the area beyond the city. In exchange,
Israel would absorb some Jewish settlement into the western part of
the city.
</P>
<P>
   But Rahman, the PLO official, said, ''There can be no agreement
without total Palestinian sovereignty over east Jerusalem. This is
a basic condition for achieving peace.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman P.J. Crowley said Clinton had received a
letter from Barak but he declined to discuss its contents. Israeli
officials, observing a news blackout, said they could not get into
the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining Clinton's decision to delay his trip to a summit
meeting in Japan, Lockhart said, ''It's a judgment that the
president made that it was useful and in the interests of the peace
process to do that, but it's not an open-ended commitment.'' He
said the president planned to get on Air Force One sometime
overnight and fly to Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ''The parties know what they have to do,'' the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Cable Increases Questioned  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee
asked federal officials Wednesday to scrutinize cable rate
increases and again raised questions about whether the industry's
prices should be regulated.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., cited an example from his suburban
Chicago district, served by AT&AMP;T's cable systems, where some
subscribers' rates recently increased by 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''My constituents are suffering under these rate increases, and
they need answers,'' Hyde wrote in a letter to the head of the
Federal Communications Commission. He urged the commission to
investigate cable competition in the area and sought advice on
whether cable rate regulation should be reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC stopped regulating most cable TV services in March of
1999, following the directive of a 1996 law. Hyde said he proposed
extending the law before regulation ended, but encountered
opposition from the industry, which also made ''many promises of
good behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I am wondering now if we made a mistake in letting regulation
expire,'' Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups applauded Hyde's move, saying that AT&AMP;T has made
double-digit rate increases in other major markets as well.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Kimmelman of the Consumers Union said he hoped the letter
would ''spur public officials to use whatever tools they have to
protect consumers from price gouging.''
</P>
<P>
   But cable industry executives defended the increases, saying
that the companies are making heavy investments to upgrade their
systems with two-way capabilities to offer Internet services and
are also adding programming to their lineup.
</P>
<P>
   The price per channel is actually decreasing in many of these
cases, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage increase ''really doesn't reflect what we're
adding to our systems,'' said Sarah Duisik, an AT&AMP;T spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Increases in the cost of programming also play a large role,
AT&AMP;T says. For example, in areas like Wheaton, Ill., where the
company raised prices by $2.74, the bulk of the rate increase --
$2.17 -- was attributable to increases in programing prices the
company must pay. Cable executives said the price of sports
programming in particular has driven up their operating costs.
</P>
<P>
   David Beckwith, spokesman for the National Cable Television
Association, said that cable also has a serious competitor in
direct broadcast satellite -- which he said has captured 15 percent
of the market in 32 states.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think that cable remains an excellent value,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Groups want genetically engineered food tested before sold  </HEADLINE>
By BRENDAN RILEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) - A group opposed to genetically
engineered food that's not tested or clearly labeled said Wednesday
that Campbell Soup Co. and Kellogg Co. should stop selling such
products.
</P>
<P>
   The Genetically Engineered Food Alert coalition, representing
various consumer and health advocates, called for the moratorium at
news conferences held here and in 20 other cities around the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Geary of the National Environmental Trust, part of the
group, said in Carson City that the two food industry giants are
part of ''a very alarming and unregulated trend'' of rapidly
increasing use of biotech products in which some crops are
genetically altered in an effort to resist pests, drought or other
adverse conditions.
</P>
<P>
   After the local news conference, Geary tried to pass out the
group's information at a local Safeway store but was asked to leave
the property. Safeway shareholders in May rejected a proposal to
ban the sale of such products.
</P>
<P>
   At a similar event in Augusta, Maine, organizers said Americans
are taking part in a vast experiment without controls or their
consent, and testing to ensure product safety should be mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   In Camden, N.J., 17 people stood in front of the Campbell Soup
headquarters holding soup cans with labels that read, ''Now
Genetically Engineered.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of Kellogg and Campbell dismissed the moratorium
request.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kellogg has a 94-year legacy of making healthful and
nutritious food and wouldn't compromise that,'' spokeswoman Chris
Ervin said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Campbell has a 130-year record of delivering high-quality food
all over the world. All the food produced by Campbell Food Co. is
safe and meets federal requirements, including labeling,'' said
spokesman John Faulkner.
</P>
<P>
   Though some European countries have banned certain biotech crops
or required labeling of biogenetic foods, the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration has not imposed similar restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   FDA spokeswoman Joan Lytle said regulations don't require labels
on genetically engineered food unless the nutritional value is
changed or an allergen is added.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't seen any evidence that the food is unsafe,'' Lytle
said, adding that all manufacturers voluntarily have informed the
FDA of their genetically engineered products.
</P>
<P>
   Lytle also said the FDA is working on strengthening guidelines
on genetically engineered foods.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed regulation would require manufacturers to notify
the agency of their intent to market such products. A
manufacturer's plan also would be available to the public through
the FDA's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   A recent report from the national Academy of Sciences and six
international scientific groups said genetically engineered crops
are safe and can help alleviate hunger and malnutrition in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the biotech crops developed so far are either tolerant
of herbicides or toxic to insects. The crops are popular with
farmers, but seed companies that developed the technology are
struggling to overcome consumer resistance in Europe and Asia.

<HEADLINE> House OK's New Addiction Drug  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Heroin addicts would have a new option for
treatment -- a drug that can be prescribed by doctors instead of
costly inpatient methadone treatments -- under a measure approved
Wednesday by the House.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, passed on a 412-1 vote, would allow doctors to
prescribe to addicts the drug buprenorphine, a controlled substance
that helps suppress the craving for heroin.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, most inpatient heroin treatments use the
government-regulated drug methadone to control cravings.
</P>
<P>
   Allowing doctors to prescribe buprenorphine, which has a very
limited euphorigenic effects but still induces withdrawal, will
expand treatment options, supporters said.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter last year, Health and Human Services Secretary Donna
Shalala said buprenorphine and a buprenorphine/naloxone combination
''are expected to reach new groups of opiate addicts -- for example,
those who do not have access to methadone programs, those who are
reluctant to enter methadone treatment programs and those who are
unsuited for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Buprenorphine is not expected to replace methadone, but to be
used to expand treatment options.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a bill that helps those who can least help
themselves,'' Rep. Tom Bliley, R-Va, said.
</P>
<P>
   To prescribe buprenorphine, doctors would have to be licensed to
dispense controlled substances and trained to treat addicts. They
also would be limited in the number of patients they could treat at
one time and be able to refer patients to counseling and other
services.
</P>
<P>
   Under the House bill, doctors would be allowed to prescribe
buprenorphine after writing to the HHS secretary that they meet the
conditions of the bill. They would then be able to start treatments
until told to stop by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration has yet to approve the use of
buprenorphine for addiction relief, spokesman Brad Stone said.
Several universities have successfully used the drug in tests.
</P>
<P>
   The ''no'' vote came from Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C.
</P>
<P>
   The House also decided on Tuesday to allow as many as 300 aliens
with life-threatening diseases or injuries to stay in the United
States indefinitely while in treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, temporary medical visas last only 120 days. At the
end of the visa, aliens can be deported regardless of what stage
the treatment is in.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, aliens can stay until the treatment can be
completed if they can prove they need the care and can pay for it.
Only 300 waivers can be issued per year and the pilot program must
be renewed after three years.

<HEADLINE> US China-Russia Policy Questioned  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration has become
''complacent and oblivious'' to China's growing military might and
its burgeoning ''anti-American'' alliance with Russia, a
congressional panel was told Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony before the House Armed Services Committee came a
day after Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese counterpart
Jiang Zemin joined to condemn what they said were U.S. attempts to
dominate world order and pledged to stand against American power.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ... relationship and the new trends within it are
sufficiently alarming and so increasingly and overtly opposed to
vital U.S. military and political interests as to deserve our
unflagging attention,'' said Stephen J. Blank of the Strategic
Studies Institute of the U.S. Army War College.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is clear ... that this is fundamentally an anti-American
relationship,'' he told the hearing into China's foreign policy,
military capabilities and view toward the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Other witnesses challenged the Clinton administration philosophy
that China's growing economic prosperity will eventually erode
communism there and lead to more democratic ways.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a dangerous complacency in these assumptions,'' said
June Teufel Dreyer, University of Miami political science
professor.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even if the People's Republic of China were to become a
democracy, China would not necessarily become less of a threat to
its neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   China, said Richard Fisher, a fellow at the Jamestown Foundation
think tank, is pushing ''an ambitious modernization program''
designed to ''subdue Taiwan,'' then ''get military dominance in the
great Asia-Pacific.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I am concerned that along with this increased military
capability will come an increased willingness to use force in ways
that directly threaten the United States and U.S. interests,'' said
committee Chairman Rep. Floyd D. Spence, R-S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Blank noted that Russia is already helping China prepare for
such a confrontation in Taiwan, saying Russian-Chinese military
transfers amount to more than $2 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Moscow is helping China build capabilities for conflict in the
Taiwan strait, and these capabilities will be used to deter or
confront us,'' if the United States comes to Taiwan's aid, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''A confrontation with the United States in and around or over
Taiwan is the dominant scenario today in China's war planning and
training,' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ending a one-day summit Tuesday in Beijing, Putin and Jiang
signed documents criticizing the proposed U.S. national missile
defense system and blasting ''hegemonism'' and attempts to
interfere in countries' internal affairs. The latter two statements
were seen as veiled attacks on NATO, perceived U.S. bullying and
last year's war on Yugoslavia, all of which have been criticized in
the past by the two former communist rivals.
</P>
<P>
   After decades of tension that followed a falling-out in the late
1950s, relations between Moscow and China have been steadily
improving since the late 1980s. Since the 1991 Soviet collapse,
China has evolved into one of Russia's major trading partners and
is the top customer for Russia's ailing military industrial
complex. Beijing has purchased billions of dollars worth of jets,
missiles, submarines and destroyers.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the most distressing things about this Russo-Chinese
relationship is the fact that the United States has been oblivious
and complacent concerning this,'' Blank said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has said that despite China's increasing
preparations for a potential clash over Taiwan, Beijing is unlikely
to attack the island nation because the Chinese believe war would
jeopardize their economic growth and world standing.

<HEADLINE> Mayor proposes scaling back tax cut plan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Mayor Rudolph Giuliani on Wednesday announced
plans to scale back tax cuts that he proposed earlier this year by
$260 million, and postpone some cuts that would have taken effect
this month until next year.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal marks at least the second time this year the mayor
has retreated on a plan that had originally called for cutting
taxes by more than $1 billion over the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   One of the tax cut proposals that could be scaled back until
January is a plan to cut the city's personal income tax surcharge
in half - which would save an individual earning $50,000 about $173
annually.
</P>
<P>
   City Council Speaker Peter Vallone, who would have to sign off
on any changes in the city's budget, was taken by surprise by the
mayor's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was perplexed by the reversal of his position on tax
relief,'' he said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Cop pleads guilty to taking bribe money from drug dealers  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A police officer formerly assigned to the Harlem
police precinct once known as the ''Dirty 30'' pleaded guilty
Wednesday to charges of taking bribes from drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Titus Mitchell, 30, pleaded guilty to grand larceny and
official misconduct, admitting that he took a bag containing
$10,000 cash that he thought was a bribe from a narcotics
trafficker.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, a cop for six years, will be sentenced by State
Supreme Court Justice Herbert Altman on Aug. 23 to one to three
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The man who gave Mitchell the $10,000 was an undercover officer
who was part of a corruption sting that police began after
receiving allegations that Mitchell was stealing money and taking
bribes from drug criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The sting transaction occurred Oct. 21, 1999, around 10:45 a.m.
at West 146th Street and Amsterdam Avenue in the 30th Precinct. The
undercover officer was in a car and Mitchell was in uniform and on
duty at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say Mitchell told a person sitting in the car with
the undercover officer to put the bag of money in a garbage can in
front of a restaurant. When Mitchell tapped on the restaurant's
window, Stanley Bailey, a correction officer, left the restaurant
and retrieved the money.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey pleaded guilty on June 14 to third-degree grand larceny.
Justice Carol Berkman sentenced him to 100 hours of community
service and a conditional discharge - the condition being that he
complete the community service.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, the 30th Precinct, which covers Upper West
Harlem along the Hudson River from 133rd Street to 155th Street,
was the scene of a corruption probe that led to the arrests of more
than 30 police officers.
</P>
<P>
   In one attention-getting incident, then-Police Commissioner
William Bratton marched into the stationhouse on West 151st Street
and confiscated the shields of several officers who had been
charged with crimes.

<HEADLINE> BC-NY--US-Diamonds, 3rd Ld-Writethru,670  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Most diamond buyers think about cost, cut and
carats - not political correctness.
</P>
<P>
   But the diamond industry has now thrown in the moral question:
Was a gem mined amid a brutal African war fueled by sales of the
shiny stones that stand for love - and luxury - in America?
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone, of course, is buying the challenge issued
Wednesday by the World Diamond Congress in Antwerp, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want a diamond. Where it comes from, how it got here, I
don't really care,'' said Christine Sabo of Marlboro, N.J.,
shopping Wednesday in Manhattan's Diamond District for ''a band to
update my wedding ring.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It may sound self-serving, but it wouldn't make a
difference,'' added Sabo, eyeing a lineup of rings in a window on
West 47th Street. ''If I like it, I'll buy it - if the price is
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Price was not the hot topic this week in Antwerp, where 85
percent of the world's rough diamonds are traded.
</P>
<P>
   International diamond officials announced strict new measures
Wednesday to clamp down on the trade in ''conflict diamonds'' used
to pay for wars in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The measures include a certification system to track rough
diamonds from the time they're mined, as well as penalties against
dealers who break United Nations embargoes on diamond sales by
rebels in Angola and Sierra Leone. The move comes in response to
charges that several African groups have financed bloody civil wars
using proceeds from illicit diamond sales.
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest diamond company, De Beers, called on its
customers to boycott the glitter sold by the rebels. However, it
wasn't until last October that DeBeers announced it would no longer
buy Angolan diamonds not accompanied by a certificate of origin.
</P>
<P>
   ''All those years DeBeers was mining in Angola, it was OK,''
said Leon Nektalov of Leon's Diamonds on 47th Street.
</P>
<P>
   In some American jewelry stores, reality - and price - is
quickly undercutting the Antwerp ideal.
</P>
<P>
   ''As long as I give a seller a check and he gives me an invoice
- it's legal,'' said Nektalov, whose store is lined with engagement
rings set with stones from Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The certified gemologist comes from four generations of diamond
experts in the former Soviet republic of Uzbekistan; his father ran
a diamond-cutting factory there.
</P>
<P>
   Nektalov doesn't believe the diamond industry is in a position
to enforce the new rules. ''It's next to impossible to trace a
rough diamond,'' he said. ''As a merchant, how will I know if it's
from Africa or Brazil?''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he said, he knows of a major diamond merchant in
Angola ''who also is strong in Russia.'' And diamonds in the rough
coming out of mines in large batches can easily be swapped and sold
together.
</P>
<P>
   ''No gemologist could tell you for sure which is which,'' said
Nektalov. ''How are they going to prove for sure where it came
from? It would take a lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time an illegally exported diamond reaches a retail buyer
with a certificate, it often passes through a dozen wholesale
hands. In addition, the world supply of already mined diamonds runs
into the tens of billions of dollars that will last for years to
come.
</P>
<P>
   But on Fifth Avenue, Tiffany &AMP; Co. is adamant about keeping its
stock free of the war-tainted diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the upscale jeweler said it has ''a zero
tolerance policy toward them. ... We are doing everything feasible
to bar conflict diamonds from our inventory.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of not buying an engagement ring paid with human lives
sure sounds like ''a good cause'' to Peter Georges, an executive
with a high-tech Silicon Valley firm.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wouldn't buy a diamond ring that comes from a place where
people are suffering or getting killed for it!'' he said, ripping
open his flowery shirt to show off a chest tattoo that reads
''Takayo'' - his girlfriend's name.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to return home to San Jose, Calif., to propose to her
bearing a 2.01-carat, platinum-set stone that runs into five
figures.
</P>
<P>
   And Georges is confident their union will be graced by a diamond
with a politically correct provenance - from Yakutsk, Russia, with
love.

<HEADLINE> Deer feeders show strong early results in killing ticks  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID DISHNEAU
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal scientists waging war on Lyme disease are reporting
sharp declines in deer tick numbers in Maryland locations where
they have installed machines that apply a pesticide to deer.
</P>
<P>
   Samplings at the three locations this past spring showed drops
of 50 percent to 78 percent in numbers of immature ticks since
1998, when the project began, said John Carroll, a research
entomologist at the Department of Agriculture's Beltsville research
center.
</P>
<P>
   ''We expect things will be better as we go along,'' Carroll said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Deer ticks, also called black-legged ticks, are carriers of
bacteria that cause the potentially debilitating disease.
</P>
<P>
   The early results from Maryland are similar to those from
Connecticut, another of the five northeastern states involved in
the project, said J. Mathews Pound, a USDA entomologist in
Kerrville, Texas, who is one of the project leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're sort of fine tuning and getting the procedure down now,
so that I think a couple years from now, we're going to see some
very good results in the neighborhood of 80 or 90 percent,'' Pound
said. ''If you can control even 80 percent of the ticks just by
treating the deer, you've got a pretty good situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Pound helped invent the contraption at the heart of the study, a
feeder box with four upright paint rollers that apply the pesticide
amitraz to the heads and necks of hungry deer. The chemical kills
the ticks but doesn't hurt other insects, Pound said.
</P>
<P>
   The machines are scattered across three Maryland test areas, at
Beltsville in Prince George's County, Gibson Island in Anne Arundel
County and Loch Raven in Baltimore County. There are 25 machines in
each of the two-square-mile test areas.
</P>
<P>
   From late May through June, Carroll and his crew collected ticks
from each area and counted the nymphs - the first generation
affected by the deaths of adult ticks poisoned by the pesticide.
</P>
<P>
   In similar habitats where no feeders were installed, the
scientists found population changes ranging from a 27 percent
decrease to an increase of less than 1 percent, Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   This is the third year of the five-year project. The other test
areas are in New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island. Results from
those states are still being compiled, Pound said.
</P>
<P>
   The deer feeders are among a host of weapons aimed at reducing
the incidence of Lyme disease and other tick-borne illnesses. The
number of reported cases of Lyme disease rose by 70 percent over a
six-year period ending in 1998, according to the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. There were 16,802 reported cases of
Lyme disease in 1998, the last year for which national totals are
available.
</P>
<P>
   Karon Damewood, a specialist on such illnesses at the Maryland
Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, said the encouraging
findings should not persuade people to let down their guard.
</P>
<P>
   ''The public health message still needs to be out there, that
all people need to always remember that whenever they have been
outdoors, they need to do a tick check and remove ticks early,''
she said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Makes Oil Reserve Pledge  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration pledged Wednesday
to tap a Northeast heating oil reserve only in case of a severe
shortage or soaring prices.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with oil company representatives, Energy Secretary
Bill Richardson said they pressed their case against using the
reserve to manipulate market prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''I assured them that I have absolutely no intention of doing
that. The government does not want to be in the heating oil
business, but we must be ready to respond to a shortage or severe
price spike,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, President Clinton ordered a swap of crude oil from
the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve with 2 million barrels of
home-heating oil that can be set aside as a separate reserve for
Northeastern states.
</P>
<P>
   The reserve is intended to supply enough oil to the region while
local distributors await overseas shipments, said Cameron Taylor,
an aide to Sen. Jim Jeffords, R-Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   ''It may be warm outside now, but come next winter when the
temperature drops, we know with certainty that the demand for oil
will rise,'' said Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, Clinton lacks the power to release the oil
but wants Congress to approve a trigger mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress does not act, some officials say it may be possible
to release the oil under the criteria used for the strategic
reserve. But those criteria are meant for a national emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say the reserve should be in place before winter, but
money is still needed to create it.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday approved a $4 million plan to lease
storage space and buy more oil if needed. The money was included in
a $15.5 billion Interior Department budget bill, which awaits
action by a House and Senate conference committee.
</P>
<P>
   Red Cavaney, president of the American Petroleum Institute, said
the reserve could divert oil that would otherwise be used in the
region to build stocks, leading to little or no net increase in
inventories. He did not attend Wednesday's meeting.

<HEADLINE> Democrat May Replace Sen. Coverdell  </HEADLINE>
By DICK PETTYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Republican Sen. Paul Coverdell's death means a
Democrat will probably be given a four-month head start in the
competition to replace him.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Gov. Roy Barnes will appoint someone to Coverdell's
seat after the senator's memorial service on Saturday, which could
give his choice an edge in the Nov. 7 nonpartisan special election
to finish Coverdell's term.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Gov. Barnes can pick someone who can unify the party, it
really does give them a huge advantage,'' said Emory University
political science professor Merle Black.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Earl Ehrhart, the House Republican whip, discounted
the advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just don't think people give any weight to somebody handing
them a senator. I think they'd prefer to elect a senator himself
and not give it over to the governor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell died Tuesday after suffering a stroke. He had four
years left in his term. Coverdell's death makes the GOP lead in the
Senate 54 to 45.
</P>
<P>
   His appointed replacement could enter the election with any
other candidates who pay the qualifying fee. The top two
vote-getters would meet in a runoff if no candidate receives 50
percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats thought to be candidates to replace him range from
popular former Gov. Zell Miller to state lawmakers who are little
known outside their own districts.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, names include Reps. Jack Kingston and
Johnny Isakson, two of the state's eight Republican congressmen.
</P>
<P>
   Kingston or Isakson would have to drop their House re-election
bids if they decide to run for the Senate. Under Georgia law, no
candidate may run for two offices at the same time. Isakson said it
was too early to discuss a Senate run.
</P>
<P>
   Kingston said he has been asked about running, ''but I'm still
in the shellshocked stage of grief.''
</P>
<P>
   ''As things settle down, people will kind of dry their eyes and
talk about what do we do next,'' he said. ''I don't see us trying
to replace that shining star, but we could try to hold on to what
we've got.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans had been making steady gains in the South since the
1960s, but Democrats took back two governorships in 1998 and cut
into earlier GOP gains in several state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes could make a historic appointment by turning to a black
politician such as Attorney General Thurbert Baker or Rep. Sanford
Bishop, Black said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That would be a choice, I think, that would certainly motivate
African-Americans to come out and it could affect the presidential
election, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Black said, Barnes could motivate female voters by
picking Secretary of State Cathy Cox. No blacks have represented
Georgia in the Senate. The only woman to do so, Rebecca Felton, was
appointed in 1922 and served only a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop said he was ''humbled'' to be mentioned, but believes
Miller would be a strong candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Miller still maintains much of the popularity he had in 1999
after eight years as governor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Zell would poll ahead of any of the other
candidates,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, 68, declined to discuss a run. ''I just don't think it's
showing the proper respect to Paul.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller ran for the Senate in 1980, losing a primary to incumbent
Herman Talmadge, who later lost to Republican Mack Mattingly. The
seat returned to the Democrats in 1986 but fell to Coverdell in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   Isakson, who ran for governor in 1990 and for Sam Nunn's Senate
seat in 1996, was elected last year to the seat former House
Speaker Newt Gingrich resigned.
</P>
<P>
   ''This might be the ideal contest for Johnny,'' said University
of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock. ''In the
past, he's had to fight through the Republican primary, where a lot
of them find him a bit too moderate.''

<HEADLINE> Lower Russian House Approves Tax  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- The lower house of parliament approved a new tax
code Wednesday that includes establishing a flat, 13 percent income
tax as part of President Vladimir Putin's plan to reform Russia's
complex revenue system.
</P>
<P>
   The State Duma's approval of the code means the measure now goes
to the upper house, the Federation Council, where its chances for
approval appear slim. The 450-member Duma can override a Federation
Council rejection of proposed legislation with a two-thirds vote.
</P>
<P>
   The measure approved Wednesday by a 234-111 vote calls for
replacing the progressive income tax with a flat tax, which
advocates say would bring more revenue into state coffers because
it would be easier to calculate and collect. Non-payment of taxes
has been a substantial problem for Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also calls for a 30 percent increase in gasoline
taxes and a 50 percent increase in tobacco taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Duma's budget committee, Alexander Zhukov,
and another committee leader, ex-Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov,
have both said the Federation Council is likely to defeat the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Another legislator, Oleg Morozov, added that ''Overriding a
Federation Council veto of the tax code would be very difficult, if
not impossible.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton spent $1 on direct mail for every $3 raised from individual donors </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The Clinton Senate campaign spent $1 on direct
mail for every $3 it raised from individual donors over a
three-month period, according to financial reports filed with the
Federal Elections Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The FEC data, covering the spending and fund-raising for Hillary
Rodham Clinton's Senate campaign during the period between April 1
and June 30, was made public Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign spent about $1.5 million on direct mail, with
thousands more spent on postage and printing, and received roughly
$4.5 million in contributions from individuals during the specified
period.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign's biggest expense was $1.84 million for the
purchase of television advertising and related expenses. Another
$630,000 was paid to political consultants and $200,000 to the Penn
&AMP; Schoen polling firm.
</P>
<P>
   Among the well-known individuals whose names showed up on
campaign contributor lists were authors Danielle Steel and Isabel
Allende, playwright Wendy Wasserstein and recording artist Marc
Anthony.
</P>
<P>
   The total take by the campaign for the quarter was $5.84
million, which includes $198,000 more from political action
committees and $1.02 million from joint fund-raising she did with
the Democratic National Committee and her party's Senate
fund-raising committee.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's total spending for the quarter was $5.5 million, which
would have exceeded her fund-raising if not for the infusions of
cash from her party's national committees.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has taken in a total of over $18 million since she began
raising money for her campaign a year ago. She ended the quarter
with nearly $7 million in the bank, and the campaign intends to
raise a total of $25 million by the November election.
</P>
<P>
   Her Republican opponent, Long Island Congressman Rick Lazio,
raised just under $5 million during the second quarter, including
$551,000 from PACS but nothing from his party's national coffers.
Combined with money left over from the $3.5 million he raised last
year, he had $6.2 million cash on hand at the end of the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's campaign made the details of his filings public on
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> 'NBC Nightly News' Producer Leaving  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The chief executive of NBC's top-rated evening
news program said Wednesday he was leaving the show to pursue a job
in new media.
</P>
<P>
   David Doss has been executive producer of the Tom
Brokaw-anchored ''NBC Nightly News'' for nearly five years.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, ''Nightly News'' has achieved dominance in the
ratings over the previous champ, ABC's ''World News Tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   An effort to air longer stories and become less of a headline
service of the day's events has attracted viewers, and in recent
months NBC's ratings lead has widened.
</P>
<P>
   ''David has done a terrific job and has worked tirelessly to
bring 'Nightly News' to its pre-eminent position,'' said NBC News
President Andrew Lack. ''The NBC News family is extremely
appreciative of David's leadership, and now that he wants to devote
his energy toward new media, we wish him all the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Wald, a senior producer at ''NBC Nightly News,'' will
fill in until a permanent successor is named.

<HEADLINE> Mideast Peace Quest Falters  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- Israel and the Palestinians swapped charges
of bad-faith bargaining Wednesday as their marathon search for a
settlement of their 52-year-old conflict faltered. Talks stretched
into the night.
</P>
<P>
   A key stumbling point appeared to be the future status of
Jerusalem, which Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat wants to make the
capital of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton shuttled among Arafat, Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak and his own experts on a gloomy, wet day matching the
mood at the Camp David retreat in the Catoctin Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   According to Palestinian sources, Clinton was proposing that
part of the city be jointly administered.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have worked very hard to find a path to an agreement,''
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said late Wednesday afternoon.
''At this point in time, we have not reached that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart signaled that after nine days of talks, time was almost
up, saying Clinton expected to leave early Thursday on his delayed
trip to Japan to meet with the other leaders of the world's
economic powers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met with Arafat even as Lockhart briefed reporters on
the situation. The president had met earlier with Barak. The two
principals in the talks did not meet face to face during the day,
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Arafat were sunder pressure to find common ground on
such contentious issues as the future of Jerusalem, the fate of 2
million to 4 million Palestinian refugees and their descendants,
the size of a Palestinian state on the West Bank and in Gaza and
the number of Jewish settlements to remain in the territories.
</P>
<P>
   Israel radio and television reported Barak had written to
Clinton complaining that the Palestinians had not gone to Camp
David to negotiate in good faith.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Palestinians arrived at Camp David lacking a true
commitment, and are not ready to have a substantive discussion
about a lasting peace and to make historic decisions,'' Israel
radio quoted a Hebrew translation of the letter. ''Unless there are
last-minute changes, the Palestinians will have to envision the
tragic consequences of an opportunity they missed.''
</P>
<P>
   Hassan Abdel Rahman, who heads the Palestine Liberation
Organization's office in Washington, sought to rebut the prime
minister. He said the Palestinians went to Camp David to achieve a
just and lasting peace that the Israeli and Palestinian people
could live with for generations.
</P>
<P>
   ''This peace does not deal with balance of forces but balance of
interests,'' Rahman told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   He contended that in the talks Israel sought to impose
settlement terms on the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart's briefing covered the peace talks as of late Wednesday
afternoon. He said they expected to keep going until at least
midnight.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think that anyone sees any value in staying on
forever,'' Lockhart said, ''but I don't think there's anyone ...
whether it be Chairman Arafat, Prime Minister Barak or President
Clinton, who wants to leave here without an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Clinton made telephone calls to four other leaders
in the Middle East ''to give them some sense of where we are in
this process.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The last 24 hours have involved very intensive discussions,''
Lockhart said. ''We have worked very hard to find a path to an
agreement. At this point in time we have not reached that.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Clinton would consider the peace effort over when he had
tried every possible avenue and concluded further talks would not
be valuable or constructive.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said the president had received written communications
from Arafat as well as Barak. He did not describe Arafat's letter,
except that it was different in nature and substance from that
Barak's letter complaining that the Palestinians were not
negotiating in good faith.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why they would send letters to Clinton when they were
sitting in talks with him, Lockhart said that was a question for
them, not him.
</P>
<P>
   He said repeatedly that the sessions couldn't keep going as they
have. ''There comes a time when you have to get on with the other
business that's before you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Jerusalem, Barak signaled before and during the summit that
he was willing to give the Palestinians more control over Arab
neighborhoods and to expand the area beyond the city. In exchange,
Israel would absorb some Jewish settlement into the western part of
the city.
</P>
<P>
   But Rahman, the PLO official, said, ''There can be no agreement
without total Palestinian sovereignty over east Jerusalem. This is
a basic condition for achieving peace.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman P.J. Crowley said Clinton had received a
letter from Barak but he declined to discuss its contents. Israeli
officials, observing a news blackout, said they could not get into
the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining Clinton's decision to delay his trip to a summit
meeting in Japan, Lockhart said, ''It's a judgment that the
president made that it was useful and in the interests of the peace
process to do that, but it's not an open-ended commitment.'' He
said the president planned to get on Air Force One sometime
overnight and fly to Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ''The parties know what they have to do,'' the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Chechen Official May Be Tried  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- A Chechen official who challenged Moscow's
civilian administrator in the rebellious region might face criminal
charges, authorities said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bislan Gantamirov, whom the Kremlin recently appointed to head
the republic's police force, ordered 200 of his men on Tuesday to
search the pro-Moscow Chechen administration in the northern town
of Gudermes for rebels. The move was an open challenge to his boss,
Mufti Akhmad Kadyrov, Russia's top civilian leader in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Kadyrov accused Gantamirov of engaging in ''an armed mutiny,''
the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Vladimir Bokovikov, deputy presidential envoy in Chechnya,
described Gantamirov's action as ''anti-constitutional,'' Interfax
said.
</P>
<P>
   The region's acting prosecutor, Nikolai Shepel, said his office
was considering opening a criminal case against Gantamirov, but
first had to review police statements about the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Gantamirov said no resolution of the dispute was reached at a
meeting Wednesday with Bokovikov, Kadyrov and Gen. Ivan Babichev,
the military commandant of the Chechen capital Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did not reach agreement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Gantamirov said later that his men would agree to lay down
arms on Friday, the news agency ITAR-Tass reported, adding that the
decision was expected to be made at a meeting militia leaders and
the heads of town and village administrations.
</P>
<P>
   Such a meeting is necessary ''to prevent the conflict with
Chechen administration chief Kadyrov from turning into an armed
opposition,'' the agency quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Bokovikov expressed hope that the two Chechen leaders would
settle their differences.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is like a big family here in which relatives argue and then
make up,'' Interfax quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Gantamirov's move appeared to be motivated by his objection to
the mufti's decision to replace several local leaders loyal to
Gantamirov with his own choices.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has tried for years to set up an effective pro-Moscow
political force in the region, but the effort has foundered in part
because of factional disputes between the Chechens.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops have taken control of most of the rebellious
region in a military operation that began in September. President
Vladimir Putin appointed Kadyrov, a local Muslim leader, to head a
civilian administration and begin rebuilding Chechnya, ruined by
two wars in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Chechen independence fighters kept up their skirmishes with
Russian forces, firing on Russian positions 13 times over the past
24 hours, military officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A federal serviceman was killed when a column of troops came
under fire Wednesday near the town of Gekhi in the Urus-Martan
region of southwest Chechnya, military officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, Russian officials said a preliminary
investigation showed that their forces were not behind the
bombardment Sunday of the village of Agishti, in which six local
residents were killed, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
   Chechen fighters forced Russian troops to withdraw after a
1994-96 war. Moscow's forces re-entered the region after militants
based there raided villages in the neighboring Russian region of
Dagestan, and after apartment bombings that killed about 300
people.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Gov. Reports Death Threats  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAXACA, Mexico (AP) -- A state governor involved in the struggle
for the future of Mexico's battered ruling party said Wednesday he
and his family have received death threats.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Murat also said police discovered telephone taps and
microphones at his offices and residence and he hinted they may be
linked to federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   Murat has been among dissident governors challenging
presidential control of the Institutional Revolutionary Party since
it lost the July 2 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ''On four occasions I received calls with death threats,'' he
told reporters. ''In two of those they threatened to affect my
daughter Lorena, who is 12, and Alejandro (his son).''
</P>
<P>
   Murat said he did not know who might be behind the threats. He
said state prosecutors will investigate, noting he did not want
federal officials involved ''because I do not have confidence in
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Murat also said he was going to give a sealed, notarized
document to be opened if anything happens to him.
</P>
<P>
   ''There I indicate who, how and why they are trying to
politically discredit us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Murat said his police chief and attorney general also have been
threatened.

<HEADLINE> Bush on Verge of Picking VP  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- George W. Bush said Wednesday he was on the
verge of picking his running mate and suggested that a vice
presidential candidate should pose little political risk to the
ticket. ''You want somebody who's not going to hurt you,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve days before the opening of the national convention that
will formally make him the Republican presidential candidate, Bush
told reporters at an impromptu news conference, ''I will make up my
mind soon.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of Republicans are urging the Texan to sit on his lead
in polls and make a ''safe'' pick, giving greater weight to a
candidate's potential to do harm than his or her prospects for
bolstering the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating and even Dick Cheney -- head of
Bush's search -- have emerged as a favorite of the take-no-chances
crowd, though Bush himself has not said whether either is a
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Others mentioned as potential running mates include Govs. Tom
Ridge of Pennsylvania and George Pataki of New York; Sens. Chuck
Hagel of Nebraska, and Fred Thompson and Bill Frist, both of
Tennessee; and Rep. John Kasich of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The two-term Texas governor has winnowed his list and has shared
his thoughts with a small number of advisers, all sworn to secrecy.
He could announce his decision as early as Monday, though he has
not ruled out waiting until the July 31-Aug. 3 Republican
convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview aboard his campaign plane Tuesday night, Bush
openly ruled out two potential candidates -- retired Gen. Colin
Powell and Senator Connie Mack of Florida -- but stopped and smiled
when Cheney's name was mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going there,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican operative Rich Galen said of Cheney, ''He'd be a
smart pick, an elder with gravitas,'' adding that the former
defense secretary's history of heart problems might be a factor.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, the most mentioned running mate
prospects for Al Gore are House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt,
Florida Sen. Bob Graham, Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry and former
Maine Sen. George Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Christopher, head of Gore's selection effort, has been
asking Democratic lawmakers about the idea of picking Mitchell,
party sources say.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in a discussion about the history of vice presidential
selections abroad his plane, said a running mate rarely helps a
ticket because voters size up the presidential candidate, not his
No. 2. On the other hand, a bad or controversial choice can hurt
the ticket, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You want somebody who can do the job, wants the job and is
willing to work for you. You want somebody who's not going to hurt
you,'' Bush said. Asked if history suggestd that a ''safe'' pick is
the best route, Bush said yes.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Texas governor was careful not to apply that
history lesson to his selection process. It wasn't clear whether or
not he was tipping his hand or merely ruminating over political
theories during an informal chat. He declined, for example, to say
whether picking an abortion-rights candidate would be a political
risk for his ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge's abortion-rights stance and related feud with Catholic
leaders in Pennsylvania has prompted many Republicans to consider
him a risky -- and increasingly -- unlikely pick.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, another abortion-rights Catholic, is not at odds with
his church leadership, thus has seen his stock rise among GOP
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Bush advisers say their boss could name an abortion-rights
nominee, appealing to moderates, and still retain support of the
party's conservative base. But with the governor holding his own
against Gore, many Republicans say he doesn't need to take the
risk.
</P>
<P>
   ''Safe means that he's going Keating,'' said GOP consultant
Scott Reed, who professes no inside knowledge. Reed, who managed
Bob Dole's 1996 campaign, said this is no time for Bush to start
taking chances.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich and Frist might fall into the ''safe pick'' category, GOP
officials say
</P>
<P>
   ''Bush rolls into the convention ahead five or six (percentage)
points in national polls and with 200 electoral votes solid. The
smart political move is a safe bet, somebody who helps with the
base and somebody who helps with a key coalition,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   A two-term governor, Keating gained national exposure for his
leadership after the Oklahoma City bombing. He is a Catholic who is
opposed to abortion and worked briefly in Washington at the
Treasury and Justice Departments.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the column of do-no-harm there is no better name than
Keating,'' Galen said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Keating are close friends, and the Oklahoma governor
was asked to submit background information to Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Several prominent Republicans have said they don't want the job,
including Powell, Florida Sen. Mack, Arizona Sen. John McCain and
former Missouri Sen. John Danforth of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he took those Republicans at their word ''unless they
signaled otherwise.'' He said Powell and Mack have unequivocally
ruled out the job; he did not offer the same assessment for
Danforth or McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Some House Republicans, either out of support for McCain or
concerns about the Bush's purported short list, have urged Bush to
select McCain, according to sources in the House and close to the
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has suggested to Bush allies that
McCain would take the job, according to GOP officials. But the
Arizona senator's advisers insist Graham is speaking only for
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to Bush and McCain say there have been no formal
or informal discussions about pairing the two. McCain has said he
doesn't want to be on the ticket, though some advisers say he
wouldn't necessarily turn it down. Bush has said he takes McCain at
his word.

<HEADLINE> Ala. To OK Dump Near Historic Trail  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Despite complaints that the project
sullies a national historic site, a company will be granted a
permit for a landfill near the Selma-to-Montgomery voting rights
trail, a state environmental official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the landfill say it is just the thing to jump-start
the economy of Lowndes County, one of the state's poorest. But
opponents, who are a mix of blacks and whites, say a garbage dump
near the Voting Rights Trail, U.S. Highway 80, would be an affront
to the civil rights activists who demanded black suffrage during a
1965 march.
</P>
<P>
   ''We received comments opposing the landfill, but the
overwhelming majority of them involved issues outside this agency's
authority,'' said Jim Warr, director of the Department of
Environmental Management, which granted the permit.
</P>
<P>
   The agency regulates only the environmental impact of landfills.
Warr said comments included concerns about traffic, zoning and
property values as well as the proximity of the landfill site to
the highway.
</P>
<P>
   The state permit was sought by Alabama Disposal Solutions. The
county had approved the landfill in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco-based Center for Race, Poverty and the
Environment has filed a complaint against ADEM, alleging that
repeated granting of landfill permits in poorer, heavily black
communities violates the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The Lowndes County
landfill is cited in that complaint to the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Mants, chairman of the county Friends of the Trail, was
among marchers attempting to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge on U.S.
80 in Selma on March 7, 1965.
</P>
<P>
   That day, Alabama state troopers attacked marchers in a
confrontation which became known as ''Bloody Sunday.'' The violence
led to the Selma-to-Montgomery march two weeks later, and
culminated in the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
</P>
<P>
   The highway was designated a national historic trail in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ''All those people, everyone who was with us, it's a direct
insult to their memory and what they stood for,'' Mants has said.
''No one would put a dump near Arlington Cemetery or the Washington
Monument.''

<HEADLINE> Temperatures Still Sizzle in South  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE BRYAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Mechanic William Kilpatrick soldiered
through another day of 100-degree heat in an outdoor garage area
Wednesday, hoping for a break from searing temperatures that were
smashing records in Alabama and baking much of the South.
</P>
<P>
   ''You think it's hot here, wait till you get up under one of
these engines that's been running three hours,'' Kilpatrick said.
''One day of work feels like a week.''
</P>
<P>
   The heat wave that has covered much of the South for the past
two weeks has been blamed for the deaths of at least 12 people in
Texas and four in Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, temperatures reached at least 100 degrees for the
15th straight day -- the old record was 13 straight in 1980 -- but
Kilpatrick might get what he was wishing for: Forecasters predicted
cooler air on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Two fronts marked by cooler air were expected to move into the
South, first Wednesday night and again Saturday. The cooler air was
expected to be accompanied by thunderstorms bringing badly needed
rain.
</P>
<P>
   Only modest relief was expected in Texas, however, where a
high-pressure system was expected to arrive by the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures also climbed past 100 for the eighth day in a row
Wednesday in north Texas. Denton recorded a high of 105; it was 103
in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Among some of the other brutal readings: 105 in Tuscaloosa,
Ala.; 104 in Hot Springs and North Little Rock, Ark.; and 101 in
Monroe, La.
</P>
<P>
   The hot weather and minimal rain added to concerns about
dwindling water resources and damage to Alabama's farmers. All 67
Alabama counties have been declared federal disaster areas by
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman. Forty-five wildfires were also
burning throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   Many hospitals in Alabama reported an increase in the number of
patients checking in with heat-related problems, most of them heat
exhaustion or dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   In Arkansas, the dry weather has so increased demand for water
that the Little Rock water utility asked its customers to water
lawns and gardens before 6 a.m.

<HEADLINE> Radioactive Runoff Seen in N.M. Lab  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- Scientists have reported radioactive storm
runoff in a fire-denuded area above the Los Alamos nuclear
laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The first significant thunderstorm to hit Los Alamos after a
fire burned through the area this spring flushed
higher-than-average levels of radiation down Los Alamos Canyon
early last month, the lab reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   It's not water used for drinking, lab officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary, uncorroborated data suggest the storm moved
plutonium, cesium-137, strontium-90 and other contaminants -- still
within allowable health standards. But in areas of the canyon,
overall combined radioactivity rose above levels that would trigger
a cleanup of drinking water -- if drinking water were at issue.

<HEADLINE> Fight Over Soda Pop Goes to Court  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Finders aren't keepers, a jury decided
Wednesday in settling a three-year-old dispute over a prize-winning
bottle of Pepsi.
</P>
<P>
   The woman who bought a $1 million bottle of Pepsi Cola gets to
keep the cash because she didn't get to drink from the bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Her co-worker's argument that she was entitled to the company's
grand prize after finding the bottle while cleaning up fizzled with
the eight-person jury.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Richardson, a devoted Pepsi drinker, says she bought the
20-oz. lucky bottle on March 17, 1998, and never drank from it
during her shift at Wild Oats Community Market, a health food
store. She said she left it in her usual spot on a counter at the
store when she left for the day.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow employee Sindy Allen says she discovered what proved to
be the winning bottle later while cleaning up. She asked fellow
employees if the Pepsi belonged to them. Thinking it refuse, she
said she poured the contents down a sink.
</P>
<P>
   But before throwing the empty bottle into the trash, Allen said
she noticed the bottle's winning ''Globe Bucks'' cap. The chances
of winning the big prize was 545 million to 1.
</P>
<P>
   Allen's attorney, Benson Lee said Tuesday that the soda's level
was a key issue in the trial.
</P>
<P>
   If any quantity of the soda was missing when his client picked
it up, ''it couldn't have been Judy's,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's attorneys, Lane Kay and Robert Goldstein, say the
bottle was never opened.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it's full, it's not trash,'' Goldstein said, adding that,
according to law, an attempt must be made to find the rightful
owner of lost items before claiming to own them.
</P>
<P>
   PepsiCo Inc. washed its hands of the lawsuit, promising to pay
the winner in yearly $50,000 payments as soon as the District Court
trial settled the issue.

Mideast Talks Stretch Into Night
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- Mideast peace talks stretched into the night as Israel
and the Palestinians swapped charges of bad-faith bargaining. A key stumbling
point appeared to be the future status of Jerusalem, which Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat wants to make the capital of a Palestinian state. President
Clinton shuttled among Arafat, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and his own
experts at the Camp David retreat in the Catoctin Mountains. According to
Palestinian sources, Clinton was proposing that part of the city be jointly
administered.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House overwhelmingly passed a bill raising
contribution limits for individual retirement accounts and 401(k)s today, hoping
to boost Americans' anemic savings rate. President Clinton said the measure
doesn't do enough for low-income people but did not threaten a veto. The House
voted 401-25 to send the measure to the Senate, with 182 Democrats joining
nearly all Republicans in favor. Senate supporters say they will push for action
in early September. Sponsors called the bill a partial answer to a U.S. savings

Auto Cos. Urged on 'Smart Cars'

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government is challenging the auto industry to
step up efforts to develop vehicles that use technology to help drivers avoid
accidents. More than three-quarters of all accidents are to due to driver error,
according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. High-tech
cruise control, crash-avoidance systems, night-vision enhancements and other
types of smart technology already are available as add-ons to some high-end
vehicles. Slater set a goal of 10 years for the auto industry to install the
technology in at least 10 percent of all passenger vehicles and 25 percent of
commercial vehicles sold in the United States.

<HEADLINE> LA Judge Rules on Convention Access  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE DeARMOND
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Activists who have set their sights on this
summer's Democratic National Convention scored a victory Wednesday
when a federal judge said city officials must give protesters
better access to the convention site.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Gary Feess agreed with the American Civil
Liberties Union, which sued the city and police department. The
suit claimed a wide buffer zone officials planned to establish
around the convention site -- the downtown Staples Center -- would
violate protesters' constitutional rights by keeping them too far
from delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ''When it's convenience versus the First Amendment, convenience
loses every time,'' Feess said. ''It is hard to imagine an event
when free speech activities would be more important.''
</P>
<P>
   Feess' decision, which will be made final in a written ruling
Thursday, affirmed activists' contention that the existing security
plan violated their free speech rights, the plaintiffs said. The
ACLU had asked for a temporary injunction to prevent the city and
police from implementing the buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy City Attorney Debra Gonzales said her office would decide
Thursday morning whether to appeal the decision. If officials don't
appeal, they'll ''have to go back to the drawing board'' and create
a new security plan in accordance with Feess' written ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Officials are afraid that protesters, especially anarchists who
caused chaos and property damage at the World Trade Organization
meeting in Seattle last year, will threaten residents, delegates
and business owners.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters involved in the ACLU lawsuit insist they plan
nonviolent demonstrations during the Aug. 14-17 convention. Police
had designated an official protest area on the opposite side of
giant parking lots located across from the Staples Center. The
plaintiffs said there was no way delegates would ever see or hear
protesters from that location and said they would not use the
location.

<HEADLINE> Pennsylvania turns party pooper on GOP's ''Las Vegas Night''  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT SONNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   RENO, Nev. (AP) - A Las Vegas-style casino night that was to be
the Nevada Republican Party's biggest fund-raiser at the national
GOP convention in Philadelphia has crapped out.
</P>
<P>
   It seems gambling is illegal in Pennsylvania - even if it's done
with fake money and chips.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania Attorney General Mike Fisher dealt the bad news to
the Nevada delegation this week.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, GOP leaders decided to scrap the event they had
hoped would bring in as much as $100,000 to help elect Republicans
in Nevada this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unfortunate. It was going to be a lot of fun,'' said Ryan
Erwin, executive director of the Nevada GOP.
</P>
<P>
   From Southwest barbecues to New England clam bakes, state and
regional theme parties are a staple of the fund-raising circuit at
national political conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada Republicans had hoped to use the $100-per-person ''Las
Vegas Night'' to raise money and lobby anyone who would listen
about the state's views on issues before Congress, including a
proposed betting ban on amateur sports and efforts to regulate
Internet gambling.
</P>
<P>
   ''It had been going extremely well. We had three or four entire
delegations that were planning to come,'' Erwin said.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Fisher insists the Republican attorney general's
office is not out to be a party pooper.
</P>
<P>
   ''We made the Nevada officials aware that our laws prohibit
gambling,'' spokesman Sean Connolly said from Harrisburg, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   ''And we encouraged the Nevada delegates and all other visitors
to enjoy all the legal cultural, historic and sporting activities
Philadelphia has to offer,'' he said, emphasizing ''legal.''
</P>
<P>
   The move was hailed by a leading compulsive gambling consultant
in neighboring New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ''I give Pennsylvania a lot of credit for doing that,'' said
Arnie Wexler, a recovering compulsive gambler himself in Bradley
Beach, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Even if no money changed hands, ''the perception would be that
it's OK to do this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Erwin said the idea was to give visitors a handful of gambling
chips ''with fake monetary value'' to play roulette, craps and
black jack.
</P>
<P>
   ''They would be able to play and we would give away trips to Las
Vegas and things like that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything we were going to do was for entertainment purposes.
There would have been no financial wagering.''
</P>
<P>
   Erwin said the Nevada delegation is trying to come up with an
alternate event.
</P>
<P>
   ''We decided it was better to be safe than sorry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A leading Nevada Democrat who works as an executive for a top
casino in Las Vegas said she was ''shocked'' by Pennsylvania's
stance.
</P>
<P>
   ''What surprises me the most is they do casino nights
nationwide, as long as they are not for profit and no real gambling
is going on,'' said Jan Jones, senior vice president for
communications at Harrah's Entertainment Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ''They do casino nights in Washington D.C.,'' said Jones, the
former mayor of Las Vegas and unsuccessful Democratic gubernatorial
candidate in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Erwin said Fisher ''cited the law for me specifically,''
pointing out that the only table games allowed must be used to
raise money for charity, and even then ''it has to be bingo or
something else.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pennsylvania law on ''gambling devices, gambling, etc.,''
Sect. 5513, states a person is guilty of a misdemeanor if he:
</P>
<P>
   ''Intentionally or knowingly makes, assembles, sets up,
maintains, sells, lends, leases, gives away, or offers for sale,
loan, lease or gift, any punch board, drawing card, slot machine or
any device to be used for gambling purposes, except playing
cards.''
</P>
<P>
   Connolly said he couldn't discuss ''scenarios that would or
would make it legal.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bascially, our laws prohibit using gambling devices. We told
them that generally it is illegal to gamble or use a gambling
device in Pennsylvania.''

<HEADLINE> Blue Jays 5, Devil Rays 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Kelvim Escobar allowed just two hits in eight
innings and Brad Fullmer drove in three runs as the Toronto Blue
Jays defeated the Tampa Bay Devil Rays 5-2 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Escobar (7-9) allowed a single to Miguel Cairo in the third and
a two-run homer to Jose Canseco in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old right-hander struck out eight and walked four.
In his previous start, Escobar allowed just three hits in six
innings for his first win in nearly a month.
</P>
<P>
   Fullmer's 17th homer, a solo shot in the eighth, gave Toronto a
5-2 lead. The Blue Jays have homered in 18 straight games. Fullmer
also had an RBI double in the first and a sacrifice fly in the
fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Koch pitched the ninth for his 22nd save in 26
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Albie Lopez (6-7) gave up five runs on nine hits for the Devil
Rays, who are 3-14 all-time in Canada, including 2-12 in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The only blemish on Escobar's night came in the fourth when he
walked Fred McGriff and Canseco followed with his eighth homer.
</P>
<P>
   After Escobar walked Felix Martinez with one out in the eighth,
he got Gerald Williams to hit into an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Delgado had a two-run double in the first for a 2-0 lead.
Fullmer's sacrifice fly in the fifth made it 4-2.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Canseco's 439th career homer moved him into 24th place on
the all-time list. ... Home plate umpire Ronald Kulpa issued a
warning to both teams in the fourth inning after Escobar just
missed Steve Cox's head with a pitch. Toronto's Raul Mondesi was
nearly hit in the head with a pitch an inning earlier. ... Lopez
pitched his second complete game of the season.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Pinch-hitter Joe McEwing delivered a two-run
single and scored on Derek Bell's single as the New York Mets
rallied in the eighth inning to beat the Montreal Expos 5-3
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets won their third in a row. Montreal has lost four
straight and eight of nine.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Guerrero hit an RBI double that put the Expos ahead 3-2
in the seventh. Bell prevented Montreal from scoring again in the
inning, throwing out Jose Vidro at the plate on Lee Stevens' fly
ball to right field.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Payton and Benny Agbayani singled off reliever Steve Kline
(1-3) to lead off the Mets eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin Mora sacrificed, and McEwing hit a soft single to center
for a 4-3 lead. Bell added a single for a two-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Mahomes (4-1) won in relief. Armando Benitez pitched the
ninth for his 22nd save in 26 chances.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos placed right-hander Tony Armas Jr. on the 15-day
disabled list just hours before he was scheduled to start.
</P>
<P>
   Armas, bothered by a strained right rotator cuff, advised
manager Felipe Alou that he couldn't pitch when he arrived at
Olympic Stadium late in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency starter Felipe Lira allowed two hits -- including Todd
Zeile's leadoff homer in the second -- and walked two in three
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Mets starter Glendon Rusch allowed six hits and two runs in six
innings. He struck out four and walked three, after not allowing a
walk in his last four starts.
</P>
<P>
   After Zeile's 15th homer gave New York a 1-0 lead, Montreal
rookie Milton Bradley tied it in the bottom half with an RBI single
in his second major league at-bat. Chris Widger's run-scoring
triple in third put the Expos ahead 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, recalled from Triple-A Ottawa earlier in the day, hit
three straight singles for Montreal in his major league debut after
fouling out to right while leading off the first.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Mets recalled right-hander Jim Mann for the third time
this season Wednesday, and lefty Bobby M. Jones was optioned to
Triple-A Norfolk. Mann, who made his major league debut on May 29,
allowed a total of four hits and three earned runs over 2 2-3
innings in his two previous stints with the Mets. Jones was 0-1
with a 10.50 ERA in just three games with New York this season. ...
Armas was placed on the 15-day DL list for the second time this
season because of the shoulder problem. He began the season on the
DL because of tendinitis in his right elbow. RHP Guillermo Mota was
recalled from Triple-A Ottawa. ... The Expos also placed OF Terry
Jones on the 15-day disabled list earlier in the day because of a
strained right quadriceps. ... Bradley was batting .298 with six
homers and 25 RBIs for Ottawa. ... Montreal relievers Scott
Strickland and Anthony Telford both made their first plate
appearances of the season. Strickland, batting for the first time
in the majors, struck out in the fourth and Telford flied out.

<HEADLINE> UC Defends Weapons Lab Record  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE LOCKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- University of California officials defended
their stewardship of the nation's nuclear weapons labs Wednesday
and said some of the responsibility for recent security gaffes lies
with the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   University regents, who have managed the Los Alamos, N.M., and
the Lawrence Livermore labs since their inception, made their first
united response to widespread criticism of their performance.
</P>
<P>
   ''The University of California is not asleep at the wheel. We
understand our responsibilities. We are trying to be as diligent as
we can,'' Regent Ward Connerly said.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble surfaced at Los Alamos in 1999 with reports that nuclear
secrets had leaked to China. After a lengthy investigation, former
Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee was charged with mishandling
classified information. Lee, who maintains he is innocent, has not
been charged with espionage.
</P>
<P>
   In May, hard drives containing classified information that were
missing from a Los Alamos vault weren't reported to senior
management for at least three weeks. The drives reappeared last
month behind a photocopier in an area that had been searched twice.
</P>
<P>
   A criminal investigation has begun.
</P>
<P>
   ''What some critics of UC's role have lost sight of is that
Washington, not the University of California, is responsible for
setting policy and providing resources,'' UC President Richard C.
Atkinson said in prepared remarks.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Energy Department Deputy Secretary T.J. Glauthier
said: ''We shouldn't get into a finger-pointing process. We are all
concerned about protecting the information in these programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Alamos Director John C. Browne told regents that he and
other lab officials had tried to get the Energy Department to step
up security in March 1999 -- well before the embarrassing
disappearance and reappearance of two Los Alamos hard drives.
</P>
<P>
   Browne said the lab officials urged resuming using bar codes to
track classified information, a requirement he said was dropped in
the early 1990s as part of a general relaxing of procedures
following the end of the Cold War. Browne said Energy officials
didn't respond to the request, but he conceded he should have
followed up on it.
</P>
<P>
   Glauthier said the missing hard drives wouldn't have gone
unnoticed if existing security procedures had been followed, even
without bar codes.
</P>
<P>
   On June 30, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson called UC's
security performance unacceptable and ordered changes in the
institution's management contract. A review is under way and
recommendations for change are expected by early September.
</P>
<P>
   Glauthier said the objective is to bring in a third party to
take responsibility for security.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton: I'm done talking about slur allegation  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Senate candidate Hillary Rodham said
Wednesday she was done talking about allegations that she used an
obscenity-laced, anti-Semitic slur 26 years ago during a heated
discussion with a campaign aide to her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've said all I'm going to say about this. It wasn't true, it
didn't happen and I'm not going to allow it to distract from the
real issues of this campaign,'' the first lady told a news
conference in Albany where she picked up the endorsement of the 2.5
million-member state AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton and her campaign did their best to get the story
behind them - staging the news conference, unveiling a new
television advertisement and making public her latest financial
filing to the Federal Election Commission - reporters continued to
question her about it.
</P>
<P>
   And, a memo surfaced in which one of the first lady's campaign
aides asked Jewish supporters to call two reporters working on the
story for Jewish newspapers and express their outrage ''as
concerned citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is important that you do not say that you (are) calling
because the campaign asked you to, but because you are outraged
with what was said about her,'' said the memo to the campaign's
''Jewish Advisory Group.'' It came from Karen Adler, an adviser to
the first lady on Jewish affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had received a lot of calls from people who wanted to
help,'' Clinton campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson said when asked
why Adler had sent the memo. He wouldn't comment on why the memo
had asked potential callers to hide the campaign's encouragement to
them.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, while attending a fund-raiser for Mayor Anthony
Masiello at the Buffalo Zoo Wednesday evening, said she did not
know about the memo.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been on the road,'' she said after spending nearly an
hour making her way through a hundreds-strong reception line that
snaked through the park.
</P>
<P>
   When told of the memo's contents, the first lady replied, ''A
lot of my friends have been calling people literally from all over
the country and the world ... Lots of people have been calling all
kinds of supporters and others to say that they know that, not only
is it not true, but we need to keep focused on the issues and what
will really matter in the lives of New Yorkers.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson said the advisory group was made up of ''leaders and
supporters in the Jewish community,'' but he wouldn't provide a
list of names of who the memo went to. Adler wasn't taking calls
from the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Dan McLagan, a spokesman for Clinton's Republican Senate rival,
Rep. Rick Lazio, said, ''It's outrageous that Mrs. Clinton's
campaign would ask her supporters to lie for her.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the reporters mentioned in the memo, Adam Dickter of the
Jewish Week newspaper, said he did become ''somewhat suspicious''
because of the ''large number of calls from people who wanted to be
heard about the subject.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's impossible for me to know which of the calls were in
response to that memo and which were calls that would have come
ordinarily, but there was a large number of calls and some of them
came in close succession from people who I do not ordinarily hear
from,'' Dickter said.
</P>
<P>
   The other reporter, Rachel Donadio of the Forward, said she had
received two unsolicited calls. ''You don't usually get people
calling you up out of the blue, saying 'I hear you're working on
this story,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday morning, Paul Fray, interviewed by ABC's ''Good
Morning America,'' stuck by his claim that an angry Hillary Rodham
had called him a ''Jew b------'' in 1974 on the night her future
husband lost a congressional race in Arkansas. Fray was Clinton's
campaign manager at the time.
</P>
<P>
   In the ABC interview, Fray offered to take a lie detector test
and truth serum to back up his claim.
</P>
<P>
   ''He can do whatever he wants to do. I have nothing to say about
it,'' the first lady said later Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Fray's claim came to light with the publication this week of
''State of A Union: Inside the Complex Marriage of Bill and Hillary
Clinton,'' a book by Jerry Oppenheimer. In the room at the time of
the argument were Fray, his wife, Bill Clinton and his future wife.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, in a call Sunday to the managing editor of
the New York Daily News, said that while his wife might have been
guilty of swearing at Fray, she did not utter any anti-Semitic
slur. The first lady, appearing on the verge of tears, had told a
news conference earlier in the day that she had not uttered such a
slur.
</P>
<P>
   As Fray continued to stick by his claim, others chimed in on
behalf of Hillary Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''All these stories about her anti-Semitism are wrong,'' Nobel
Prize winner and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel told the New York
Daily News while revealing that the first lady had earlier donated
a portion of the earnings from her 1996 ''It Takes a Village'' book
to the Elie Wiesel Foundation for Sanity.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, eight Jewish Democratic lawmakers held a hastily
arranged news conference at the Democratic National Committee to
support the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have known Hillary Clinton now for eight years. She does not
have an anti-Semitic thought or an anti-Semitic bone in her body,''
New York Sen. Charles Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
   ''On Avenue J in Flatbush, where Jewish voters are making their
decisions about which candidates they're comfortable with and want
to be in the United States Senate, it doesn't amount to bupkus,''
said Rep. Anthony Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   Also on hand were Sens. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, Joseph
Lieberman of Connecticut and Barbara Boxer of California; and New
York Reps. Nita Lowey, Eliot Engel and Jerrold Nadler.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Clinton said she would be attending services at an
Orthodox synagogue on Long Island on Saturday, but wasn't certain
yet whether she would use that appearance to talk more about the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Marc Schneier of the Hampton Synagogue in Westhampton
Beach said the first lady's visit was in the works for several
weeks before the controversy erupted.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's a great friend of the Jewish community but I would say
above all I know her as a woman of integrity and honesty and great
intelligence and there's no reason to second-guess her now,''
Shneier, who heads the North American Boards of Rabbis, which
includes rabbis from all branches of Judaism, said.

<HEADLINE> L.A. District Sued Over Toxic Site  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A civil rights group sued the Los Angeles
school district Wednesday, demanding that officials reverse their
decision to walk away from the $170 million, half-built high school
that sits on a toxic site near downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed in Superior Court on behalf of a coalition
of parents, teachers and students by the Mexican American Legal
Defense and Educational Fund, a nonprofit advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Education voted in January to jettison the Belmont
Learning Center, the nation's costliest high school, after
environmental tests at the site, a former oil field, revealed
dangerously high levels of sulfur dioxide and potentially explosive
methane gas.
</P>
<P>
   The state-of-the-art learning center originally envisioned was a
long-promised replacement for aging Belmont High School, which
serves a largely poor, minority neighborhood that is so crowded
with students that thousands are bused to other campuses each
school day.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit accuses the district of violating state law by
failing to commission a new environmental impact report after
dropping plans to finish the school. The lawsuit asks that the
district be ordered to prepare a new report.
</P>
<P>
   School officials said in a statement they are drafting a plan to
commission a new report and have not ruled out any future plans for
the site, including using it as a school.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Wins Support From Opponent  </HEADLINE>
By TONY CZUCZKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- A state branch of the scandal-plagued Christian
Democrats received secret donations from a candy company last year,
prosecutors said Wednesday, indicating that shady financing
continued even after Helmut Kohl's departure as chancellor and
party leader.
</P>
<P>
   The new allegations in Hesse state hurt the conservatives'
efforts to douse a wider party financing scandal, sparked by Kohl's
admission that he accepted illegal campaign funds as chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Democrats in Hesse, already an earlier focus of
the scandal, last week acknowledged receiving 925,000 marks in
secret donations in the 1980s and 1990s. Prosecutors said the donor
was candymaker Ferrero, which has a major plant in the state.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, prosecutors in the state capital Wiesbaden
confirmed that the secret funds flowed also last year, when the
Christian Democrats captured the statehouse in February elections.
Opposition leaders called for an investigation into whether the
donations prompted tax breaks for Ferrero, a link the Christian
Democrats denied.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl admitted in December that he accepted about $1 million in
anonymous donations in the 1990s, saying the money was given to
help his party in former communist East Germany. Despite
investigations by prosecutors and parliament, he insists he
promised the donors discretion and won't break his word.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament president Wolfgang Thierse ordered Kohl's party
Wednesday to repay the amount to public coffers by Aug. 21, the
first time he set a deadline. Under sanctions provided by German
law, the Christian Democrats also must forfeit twice the amount
accepted by Kohl -- or $2.1 million -- in matching campaign funds,
Thierse said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Kohl launched an independent fund-raising
campaign to cover potential fines for his anonymous donations. Last
month, he transferred the more than $3.8 million collected so far
to the party.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Kohl's fall from grace, one of his biggest foes said the
former chancellor should be invited to speak at a national
celebration commemorating 10 years of German unity in October.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to accept that he played the decisive role back then.
He belongs there and must speak,'' Gregor Gysi, a leader of the
former East German communists, was quoted Wednesday as saying in an
interview with the newspaper Die Welt.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Democrat-led government in Saxony state says it
has invited Kohl to the Oct. 3 ceremony at the Dresden opera, but
not as a speaker. Kohl headed the conservative party for 25 years
and oversaw the historic reunification of East and West Germany in
1990.

<P>
   VAN HORNESVILLE, N.Y. (AP) -- Everett Needham Case, a former
statesman and university president credited with introducing the
''core curriculum'' now in place at many colleges, died Tuesday. He
was 99.
</P>
<P>
   Inducted as Colgate University president in 1942, Case pledged
the university's cooperation with the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps to

   After the war, Case was instrumental in creating Colgate's
version of the so-called ''core curriculum'' emphasis on a
broad-based freshman program rather than a narrow field of study.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, Case was appointed as a consultant on China-U.S. policy
to Secretary of State Dean Acheson. In 1964, Case helped found the
National Committee on U.S.-China Relations and in 1973 went to
China as senior member of the China-in-Transition delegation.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Dave McCarty hit a grand slam and Johnny Damon
had a three-run homer to power the Kansas City Royals past the
Cleveland Indians 10-5 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   McCarty's first career grand slam gave the Royals a 4-3 lead in
the sixth inning. Gregg Zaun followed with a solo homer off Chuck
Finley (8-7), who had allowed only three hits over the first five
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City loaded the bases on singles by Rey Sanchez, Jermaine
Dye and Mark Quinn in the sixth. McCarty then hit a two-out, 2-1
pitch 412 feet into the bleachers in left-center for his ninth
homer.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Sweeney had an RBI single and Joe Randa a sacrifice fly to
make it 7-4 in the Royals' seventh, and Damon connected off Jaime
Navarro in the eighth to make it 10-4.
</P>
<P>
   Mac Suzuki (5-4) allowed four runs and nine hits over six
innings as Kansas City earned consecutive wins for the first time
since June 28-29, when the Royals defeated Cleveland 8-1 and 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Thome hit two of Cleveland's three solo homers.
</P>
<P>
   Finley allowed five runs on eight hits in 5 2-3 innings,
striking out five and walking one.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland loaded the bases with none out in the seventh, but
left-hander Tim Byrdak struck out Thome and right-hander Jerry
Spradlin got Travis Fryman to bounce into a force out at home and
Ricky Ledee to foul out. Spradlin went 2 2-3 innings for his
seventh save.
</P>
<P>
   Thome gave Cleveland a 1-0 lead in the fourth by hitting the
first pitch into the seats in right-center for his 26th homer.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians made it 3-0 later in the inning, helped by a
throwing error by Damon in center.
</P>
<P>
   Thome hit his 27th homer to pull Cleveland within 5-4 in the
sixth. It was his second two-homer game in three nights and 15th
multihomer game of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Alomar hit his fourth homer for Cleveland to make it 10-5
in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: McCarty is hitting .386 (17-for-44) this season against
lefties. ... Nineteen of Thome's 25 homers have come with no one on
base. ... Thome has a .528 (19-for-36) average when putting the
first pitch in play. ... Indians second baseman Roberto Alomar left
in the sixth inning with a sore left ankle. ... Finley is 15-11 in
his career against the Royals. ... Cleveland's 421st consecutive
sellout crowd made the Indians the first team to surpass 2 million
in home attendance this season.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Pulitzer Prize winner Dean P. Baquet,
national editor of The New York Times, was named managing editor of
the Los Angeles Times on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Times also restructured its top newsroom
management, eliminating the positions of an executive editor and
two managing editors who had shared responsibility for news
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Baquet, 43, will oversee all the paper's news operations except
the opinion page. He will report directly to John S. Carroll, the
former editor of The (Baltimore) Sun who was named Times editor and
executive vice president in April after Tribune Co. bought the
paper's parent Times Mirror Co.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dean Baquet has already established a national reputation,
first as a hard-digging reporter and then as a thoughtful editor,''
Carroll said. ''His skills and breadth of experience will have an
immediate impact at the Los Angeles Times.''
</P>
<P>
   Baquet will join the Times in August.
</P>
<P>
   New duties for Executive Editor Leo Wolinsky and managing
editors John Arthur and Karen Wada ''will be worked out over the
next several weeks,'' Carroll said in a memo to the staff.
</P>
<P>
   Baquet became national editor of The New York Times in 1995,
directing news coverage of the United States. He joined paper in
1990 and served as a metropolitan reporter, special projects editor
and deputy metropolitan editor.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988 Baquet led a three-member team at the Chicago Tribune
that won a Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting on corruption
in the Chicago City Council. He worked for the Tribune from 1984 to
1990. Previously, he worked for the States-Item and The
Times-Picayune in New Orleans.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Los Angeles Dodgers manager Davey Johnson was
discharged from a nearby hospital Wednesday, and could be back in
uniform within a day.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's at home,'' team spokesman Derrick Hall said shortly
before the first pitch of the Dodgers' game against Colorado on
Wednesday night. ''It's possible he could be back tomorrow night,
that's the best-case scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was hospitalized Sunday morning after feeling dizziness,
and was diagnosed as having an irregular heart rhythm that is now
under control.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and his wife, Susan, issued a statement which read in
part: ''Upon release from the hospital, we wanted to assure
everyone that we are doing fine and looking forward to getting back
into the baseball routine. We also wanted to take this opportunity
to thank all of our family and friends who expressed their thoughts
and concerns through warming gifts, prayer, visits and phone
calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 57, missed his fourth game Wednesday night. Bench coach
Jim Tracy has run the club in his absence.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy said before the game he had spoken with Johnson on Tuesday
night for about 15 minutes, while Johnson was in the Tommy Lasorda
Heart Institute at the Centinela Hospital Medical Center in nearby
Inglewood.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the first time, he really sounded like Davey,'' Tracy
said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Promotes New Web Site  </HEADLINE>
By NATALIE GOTT
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Politics in the new millennium: Gov. George
W. Bush launched a new Web site Wednesday and made a point of
personally showing it off while his campaign prepared a TV ad to
steer people to it.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site allows users to download posters or placards for
campaign events, listen to live Internet ''radio shows'' and enter
''fun and humorous'' contests -- as well as offering the usual
features providing news about the candidate and asking for money.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the only thing in our campaign we're constantly
reinventing,'' Bush said in a dig at Vice President Al Gore, the
Democratic opponent he accuses of changing positions for political
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also was meeting privately with members of his
high-technology council of advisers, including Dell Computer Corp.
chairman Michael Dell. The group planned to discuss Internet
privacy, cyber crime and a ''digital divide'' that often leaves
minority members behind.
</P>
<P>
   At a brief news conference, Bush took a fresh swipe at Gore and
the Clinton administration, accusing them of declining to take a
clear position on whether to breach Snake River dams in the Pacific
Northwest to save salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials, meanwhile, released statements making
their case that the action isn't necessary for now despite pleas by
environmentalists. Business interests oppose breaching the dams.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't believe we ought to be breaching the dams,'' said
Bush, who made the same point while campaigning recently in Oregon.
As to Gore, ''He needs to stand up and let us know his position,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign was planning to release three ads on Thursday,
the first since the primary campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, campaigning in Kansas City, Mo., said, ''I think what is
needed is to bring all the stakeholders together. I'm going to
bring all the parties together to come up with a solution that
respects the environment and that does not cause an upheaval in the
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he issued a stronger statement siding with
environmentalists. He said that if, under the administration's
''partnership'' strategy, sufficient progress on restoring salmon
is not made ''we may then have no choice but to pursue options such
as dam breaching, but we must first exhaust all reasonable
alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush brought up the subject of the Snake River dams as he
demonstrated how to navigate through his Web site to find news
releases.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Fox News, Bush further criticized the Clinton
administration, this time over its handling of continuing campaign
finance questions about Gore. Asked if he had confidence in the
Justice Department and Attorney General Janet Reno, Bush said
''No.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think she's interested in having a full airing,'' Bush
said. ''I think there have been some irregularities. I would hope
we will have full disclosure.''
</P>
<P>
   A TV ad touting the Web site will air Friday in the San
Francisco-San Jose and New York City markets, said campaign
spokesman Ari Fleischer. Using fast-paced music, flashing lights
and tilted camera angles, the ad directs people to go to
www.georgewbush.com. The Bush campaign said it is the first
political ad devoted primarily to driving voters to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   However, the revamped Bush Web site wasn't quite ready to go. On
Wednesday afternoon, large chunks of the Spanish-language section
still were blank. The Gore campaign tried to make something of
that, noting the pictures of Bush were ready and saying ''it's a
question of priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   During his news conference, Bush joked that the modern-day
technology could play a role in his choice for a running mate. One
factor, he said with a smile, was ''whether or not they've got a
good Web page.''
</P>
<P>
   Before his meeting with the high-tech advisers, Bush said,
''America is a pioneer in the high-tech industry and it is vital
for us to maintain this status. Leading the world in innovation
will not only improve the lives of Americans, but will also create
many quality jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign announced Wednesday that Elaine Chao will be a
featured speaker during the opening night of the Republican
Convention. Chao is married to Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.
</P>
<P>
   She is the former head of the United Way and the Peace Corps.
She served as deputy secretary of the U.S. Department of
Transportation under President Bush. Currently, Chao is a
distinguished fellow at the Washington-based Heritage Foundation, a
conservative think tank. Chao's family immigrated to the United
States from Taiwan when Chao was 8 years old.

<HEADLINE> Reds 4, Astros 0  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL A. LUTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Pete Harnisch pitched a four-hitter for his
second straight complete game, leading the Cincinnati Reds over the
Houston Astros 4-0 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Larkin hit a solo homer to fuel a three-run sixth inning,
then tripled in the seventh and scored on a sacrifice fly by Ken
Griffey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Larkin said the Reds told him they can't
afford his asking price, and will either trade him or watch him
become a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Harnisch (3-5) was 4-0 last season against the Astros, one of
his former teams.
</P>
<P>
   In his previous start at Colorado on Friday, Harnisch pitched
the first complete game at Coors Field this season and snapped the
Reds' string of 103 games without a complete game.
</P>
<P>
   Harnisch struck out four and walked two in his 11th career
shutout.
</P>
<P>
   After Craig Biggio doubled and Lance Berkman walked in the first
inning, Harnisch retired the next 14 batters in a row and didn't
allow another hit until Julio Lugo's single in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Biggio became the first Astros player to hit 400 career doubles.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Holt (4-11) fell to 1-5 in eight starts against the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Holt didn't give up a hit until two outs in the fourth when
Dante Bichette doubled off the left-field scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   Larkin broke up the scoreless game in the sixth with his 10th
home run. Young had an RBI single and Holt walked home the third
run of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Stynes had his streak of eight consecutive multi-hit games
snapped for the Reds.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Sean Casey extended his hitting streak to a career-high 12
games. Bichette has a 13-game string. ... The Reds purchased the
contracts of pitcher Mark Wohlers and infielder Brooks Kieschnick.
Wohlers, who last pitched in the major leagues for the Atlanta
Braves, did not allow an earned run in his last three minor league
outings. ... The Astros have signed their top pick in the June
draft. Pitcher Robert Stiehl was assigned to Class A Auburn.

<HEADLINE> Future of Pickens, Dillon Uncertain  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Training camp hasn't even started, and the
Cincinnati Bengals are up to their stripes in problems.
</P>
<P>
   Disgruntled receiver Carl Pickens, a player the team doesn't
really want around, has been told to show up. Running back Corey
Dillon, a player the Bengals really need, is planning to stay away.
</P>
<P>
   Pickens' predicament overshadowed everything as the Bengals got
ready to open training camp Friday in Georgetown, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm amazed by how this has been handled,'' said Pickens'
agent, Hadley Engelhard. ''This is not how a professional team
should handle this.''
</P>
<P>
   Three months ago, the Bengals deleted Pickens' name from the
depth chart, took the name plate off his cubicle and told him to
skip minicamp. They said he wouldn't be with the team much longer
and dropped his biography from the 2000 media guide.
</P>
<P>
   Now, unable to resolve a grievance by the players association
over how they used their franchise tag on Pickens, the Bengals have
ordered him to report to camp after all. They tried again Wednesday
to reach an agreement with the union that would leave Pickens a
free agent, but had some more snags.
</P>
<P>
   Unless there's a settlement, Pickens will be expected to report.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just how it all comes together, I'm not sure I know,'' general
manager Mike Brown said. ''I hope that Carl will come in with the
attitude he should and that we'll look forward instead of
backward.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides are caught in the middle. The Bengals didn't release
Pickens, so they have to bring him to camp. Pickens is under
contract, so he has to report or risk fines and the loss of part of
his $3.5 million signing bonus from last year.
</P>
<P>
   Engelhard said Pickens isn't sure whether he'll report if no
settlement is reached.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I brought the word 'settlement' up with Mike, he said, 'I
expect to see Carl on Friday,''' Engelhard said.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bruce Coslet isn't looking forward to seeing Pickens, who
publicly criticized Brown's decision to bring Coslet back for
another season.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do I want him? Not necessarily. I'll be honest,'' Coslet said.
''But in the same breath, let me say this: If he does (report),
I'll treat it as a professional relationship and I'll expect him to
do the same.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pickens problem has already affected the team. The Bengals
began adding a loyalty clause to newcomers' contracts, threatening
them with loss of signing bonuses if they criticize management.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Dugans, a third-round draft pick, is balking at signing a
contract with what's been dubbed the ''Carl Pickens Clause.''
</P>
<P>
   Dillon's holdout threat is related to money. He rejected a
five-year, $21.5 million offer last month because he wants to get
at least $5 million per year. Dillon made the Pro Bowl last season
after a third consecutive 1,000-yard campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Katie Blackburn, the Bengals' executive vice president, said the
team made a new offer Tuesday in the neighborhood of $5 million a
year, including incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Dillon's agent, Marvin Demoff, didn't return telephone messages
from The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati needs a proven runner to take pressure off Akili
Smith, who's entering his first season as starting quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   If Dillon holds out, the Bengals will have to try to get by with
inexperienced backs Michael Basnight, Sedrick Shaw, Brandon
Bennett, Curtis Keaton, Nick Williams and Clif Groce.
</P>
<P>
   Those six have rushed for a combined 1,111 yards and four
touchdowns in their careers. Dillon rushed for 1,200 yards with
five touchdowns last season.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Bid Leaders May Be Indicted  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL FOY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- An Olympic sponsor acknowledged Wednesday
night it was cooperating with federal investigators looking into
$130,000 in cash payments given to the two men who led Salt Lake's
bid for the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the men, Tom Welch and Dave Johnson, believe the
payments will figure in a barrage of grand jury indictments against
them. No charges had been filed by Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   New York-based Jet Set Sports, a corporate ticket and travel
agent for the 2002 Games, made a series of cash payments to bid
leaders totaling $130,000 from August 1994 to May 1995, according
to Johnson attorney Max Wheeler.
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler said the money was used to reimburse Welch and Johnson
for travel and lodging expenses and gifts for International Olympic
Committee members. The cash came in handy when banks were closed on
weekends or at overseas meetings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Welch and Johnson can prove the money was spent on the bid
effort, not to enrich themselves, said Wheeler, who nonetheless
expects the Justice Department to allege the bid leaders kept the
money.
</P>
<P>
   Jet Set corporate counsel Robert Boyar issued a statement
Wednesday confirming that company president Sead Dizdarevic made
contributions to the Salt Lake bid committee at the request of bid
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Dizdarevic has fully disclosed and explained these
contributions to Department of Justice investigators and is
cooperating with the ongoing investigation,'' Boyar said. He did
not immediately return a call for elaboration.
</P>
<P>
   Dizdarevic made the cash payments to Welch and Johnson because
he stood to ''make a huge profit'' as a Utah sponsor, Wheeler said.

Bush on Verge of Picking VP

   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- George W. Bush said today he was on the verge of
picking his running mate and suggested that a vice presidential candidate should
pose little political risk to the ticket. ''You want somebody who's not going to
hurt you,'' Bush said. Twelve days before the opening of the national convention
that will formally make him the Republican presidential candidate, Bush told
reporters at an impromptu news conference, ''I will make up my mind soon.'' A
number of Republicans are urging the Texan to sit on his lead in polls and make
a ''safe'' pick.

doesn't do enough for low-income people but did not threaten a veto. The House
voted 401-25 to send the measure to the Senate, with 182 Democrats joining
nearly all Republicans in favor. Senate supporters say they will push for action
in early September. Sponsors called the bill a partial answer to a U.S. savings

   MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Mechanic William Kilpatrick soldiered through
another day of 100-degree heat in an outdoor garage area today, hoping for a
break from searing temperatures that were smashing records in Alabama and baking
much of the South. The heat wave that has covered much of the South for the past
two weeks has been blamed for the deaths of at least 12 people in Texas and four
in Louisiana. In Alabama, temperatures reached at least 100 degrees for the 15th
straight day -- the old record was 13 straight in 1980 -- but forecasters

Auto Cos. Urged on 'Smart Cars'
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government is challenging the auto industry to
step up efforts to develop vehicles that use technology to help drivers avoid
accidents. More than three-quarters of all accidents are to due to driver error,
according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. High-tech
cruise control, crash-avoidance systems, night-vision enhancements and other
types of smart technology already are available as add-ons to some high-end
vehicles. Slater set a goal of 10 years for the auto industry to install the
technology in at least 10 percent of all passenger vehicles and 25 percent of
commercial vehicles sold in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Discusses Setting Up New State  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL ALEXANDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- The democratically elected government toppled
during Fiji's two-month hostage crisis met Thursday to discuss
setting up a new state in the western part of the country, Fiji
radio said.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting came a day after coup leader George Speight
reportedly forced a delay in the Fiji's new Cabinet taking office,
a move that raised concern of a return to the civil unrest that has
plagued this Pacific island nation.
</P>
<P>
   Speight threw Fiji into crisis on May 19 when he led an armed
gang into Parliament and took dozens of lawmakers hostage. The
military then took control of the country, working out an agreement
with Speight this month on a new government that would
disenfranchise ethnic Indians. The last hostages were freed July
13.
</P>
<P>
   The demise of democracy in Fiji prompted Australia and New
Zealand to impose sanctions and other nations are expected to
follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, former Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry and other
ministers from his deposed People's Coalition government held talks
in the western town of Ba on developing a breakaway state in
western Viti Levu, the radio report said.
</P>
<P>
   Details of their discussions were not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   The Cabinet postponement was officially attributed to an illness
by new President Ratu Josefa Iloilo.
</P>
<P>
   But Speight, who says he represents indigenous Fijian interests
against the minority Indians, said he was not satisfied with the
20-member Cabinet named Tuesday -- although it had no ethnic Indians
and two Speight supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Speight and Iloilo met Thursday to discuss the slate of Cabinet
officers. When the body was announced Tuesday, it was to have
included at least two of Speight's supporters and no ethnic
Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Speight's coup was carried out in the name of guaranteeing
political superiority to indigenous Fijians. The minority ethnic
Indians make up 44 percent of the 814,000 population but dominate
the economy in Fiji, a nation of 320 islands about 2,250 miles
northeast of Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The Cabinet delay came as signs of civil unrest cropped up once
again in this Pacific nation.
</P>
<P>
   As Speight left parliament on Wednesday, his supporters set fire
to nine vehicles in apparent anger at the Cabinet lineup.
</P>
<P>
   The arson spree reportedly ended immediately after the Cabinet
delay was announced.

<HEADLINE> 4 Former Police Officers Indicted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Four former San Diego police officers have been
indicted in connection with a scheme to bring stolen sinks, toilets
and other plumbing supplies from Chicago and sell them to friends
and co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the officers paid a warehouse manager with cash, trips
to Las Vegas or sexual favors for the stolen goods, according to
the federal indictment unsealed Wednesday. All three resigned from
the force after FBI agents searched their homes in February.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth officer, who resigned Wednesday, was indicted for
allegedly interfering with the federal probe by alerting an
officer's wife about a wiretap.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate indictment, one of the officers and his wife were
charged with conspiring to transport 220 pounds of marijuana around
the country in a motor home.
</P>
<P>
   Two officers were also charged with possessing illegal weapons --
two silencers and two automatic weapons. One of those officers, Jim
Coleman, 36, pleaded guilty to five felony charges.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief David Bejarano said the allegations are ''quite
painful'' for the department but do not reflect the integrity of
the department's more than 2,800 other employees.
</P>
<P>
   Three people from the Chicago area were indicted in the case as
well. One of them, Perfecto Ochoa III, 44, of Palos Heights, Ill.,
a warehouse manager for Builder's Plumbing and Heating Supply,
pleaded guilty to conspiracy to transport stolen goods.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone messages left with lawyers representing several of the
other defendants were not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI discovered the alleged crimes while investigating
another case.

<HEADLINE> Bombs Found at National Guard Base  </HEADLINE>
By GRETCHEN EHLKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- A man apparently angry about U.S. involvement
in Kosovo broke into an Air National Guard base Wednesday, scrawled
graffiti and dropped a shopping bag containing two pipe bomb-type
explosives as security guards ran after him, the FBI said. The
bombs did not explode.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI searched for the man.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are taking this as a very serious act of international
terrorism,'' FBI agent Brian Manganello said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI said the man spray-painted red graffiti on two buildings
and a satellite dish. A view of the 128th Air Refueling Wing base
from a TV helicopter showed the words ''Free Kosova'' scrawled on
the dish. Kosova is the Albanian name for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   During the NATO airstrikes in Yugoslavia in 1999, the 128th Air
Refueling Wing sent about 170 members to a base outside London,
where they serviced aircraft flying in NATO's air operations in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the graffiti, ''it was someone who was opposed to the
U.S. involvement,'' FBI agent Barry Babler said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators would not specify what the graffiti said.
</P>
<P>
   Regular personnel were not on the base when security guards
spotted the man about 5 a.m. Wednesday. The guards chased him into
a field, where he dropped the bag containing two round devices
similar to pipe bombs, Manganello said.
</P>
<P>
   A bomb squad defused the devices, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The base was closed after the incident, and 150 to 175 personnel
were given leave, said Lt. Col. Jim Waters. A sign reading ''actual
threat condition'' was posted outside the gate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both bombs were very capable of killing somebody without
question,'' David J. Williams, FBI special agent in charge, said
Wednesday night. ''We have no idea what his target was or if he had
a target. We think there was serious intent to do damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said his agency was comparing a similar ''incendiary
attack'' that occurred at an Army reserve center in Milwaukee on
March 17.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were also some spray painting things there that would
indicate that possibly they could have come from the same author,''
Williams told WTMJ-TV.

<HEADLINE> Mideast Talks End Without Agreement  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat broke off nine days of summit
talks late Wednesday night without agreement on resolving their
52-year-old conflict, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was expected to issue a statement of his own at the
White House later and then board Air Force One for Japan to attend
a weekend conference on economics with seven other leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''The summit has come to a conclusion without reaching an
agreement,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said in a statement
read by his deputy, P.J. Crowley, to reporters here.
</P>
<P>
   No details of the final hangups were disclosed, but Jerusalem
was believed to be the principal stumbling block with Barak and
Arafat wrangling over the city's future. Clinton was understood to
have pressed the two leaders to accept a U.S.-crafted compromise on
Jerusalem and other core issues, including the disposition of
Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   But with his already delayed departure for Japan looming just
ahead, the president finally had to abandon his marathon effort and
head home from the Camp David, Md. retreat in the Catoctin
Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   A daylong downpour matched the gloomy outcome of the desperate
U.S. attempt to bridge the gap between the two sides. Where
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, U.S. mediator Dennis B. Ross
and other U.S. experts had failed, Clinton hoped by weighing in
personally he would be able to sway Barak and Arafat to make peace.
</P>
<P>
   Before hosting the summit, Clinton had warned publicly that
failure could send the region into a dangerous downward spiral.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, who was eager for a summit, had let it be known that he
was prepared to expand Palestinian control over some areas of
Jerusalem. But Arafat demanded sovereignty over the eastern portion
of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic collapse of the talks came after Clinton delayed to
trip to Japan by one day in a last-ditch effort to salvage some
kind of agreement. But none emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, in briefing reporters, Lockhart had indicated time was
running out for an agreement, saying no one saw any value in
''staying on forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met with Arafat even as Lockhart briefed reporters on
the situation. The president had met earlier with Barak. The two
principals in the talks did not meet face to face during the day,
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Arafat were sunder pressure to find common ground on
such contentious issues as the future of Jerusalem, the fate of 2
million to 4 million Palestinian refugees and their descendants,
the size of a Palestinian state on the West Bank and in Gaza and
the number of Jewish settlements to remain in the territories.
</P>
<P>
   Israel radio and television reported Barak had written to
Clinton complaining that the Palestinians had not gone to Camp
David to negotiate in good faith.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Palestinians arrived at Camp David lacking a true
commitment, and are not ready to have a substantive discussion
about a lasting peace and to make historic decisions,'' Israel
radio quoted a Hebrew translation of the letter. ''Unless there are
last-minute changes, the Palestinians will have to envision the
tragic consequences of an opportunity they missed.''
</P>
<P>
   Hassan Abdel Rahman, who heads the Palestine Liberation
Organization's office in Washington, sought to rebut the prime
minister. He said the Palestinians went to Camp David to achieve a
just and lasting peace that the Israeli and Palestinian people
could live with for generations.
</P>
<P>
   ''This peace does not deal with balance of forces but balance of
interests,'' Rahman told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   He contended that in the talks Israel sought to impose
settlement terms on the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart's briefing covered the peace talks as of late Wednesday
afternoon. He said they expected to keep going until at least
midnight.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think that anyone sees any value in staying on
forever,'' Lockhart said, ''but I don't think there's anyone ...
whether it be Chairman Arafat, Prime Minister Barak or President
Clinton, who wants to leave here without an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Clinton made telephone calls to four other leaders
in the Middle East ''to give them some sense of where we are in
this process.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The last 24 hours have involved very intensive discussions,''
Lockhart said. ''We have worked very hard to find a path to an
agreement. At this point in time we have not reached that.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Clinton would consider the peace effort over when he had
tried every possible avenue and concluded further talks would not
be valuable or constructive.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said the president had received written communications
from Arafat as well as Barak. He did not describe Arafat's letter,
except that it was different in nature and substance from that
Barak's letter complaining that the Palestinians were not
negotiating in good faith.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why they would send letters to Clinton when they were
sitting in talks with him, Lockhart said that was a question for
them, not him.
</P>
<P>
   He said repeatedly that the sessions couldn't keep going as they
have. ''There comes a time when you have to get on with the other
business that's before you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Jerusalem, Barak signaled before and during the summit that
he was willing to give the Palestinians more control over Arab
neighborhoods and to expand the area beyond the city. In exchange,
Israel would absorb some Jewish settlement into the western part of
the city.
</P>
<P>
   But Rahman, the PLO official, said, ''There can be no agreement
without total Palestinian sovereignty over east Jerusalem. This is
a basic condition for achieving peace.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman P.J. Crowley said Clinton had received a
letter from Barak but he declined to discuss its contents. Israeli
officials, observing a news blackout, said they could not get into
the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining Clinton's decision to delay his trip to a summit
meeting in Japan, Lockhart said, ''It's a judgment that the
president made that it was useful and in the interests of the peace
process to do that, but it's not an open-ended commitment.'' He
said the president planned to get on Air Force One sometime
overnight and fly to Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ''The parties know what they have to do,'' the spokesman said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   EAST GREENBUSH, N.Y. (AP) - Police shot and killed a 31-year-old
man late Wednesday after he held them at bay for nearly eight hours
then came out of his house shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas J. Marino died during surgery at 9 p.m., an hour after
arriving at Albany Medical Center Hospital, according to a hospital
spokesman. Marino was shot several times in the chest by police
after he left the house in this Albany suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Marino, who may have been depressed over a long-term disability,
barricaded himself in his house beginning at 11 a.m. then kept
police at bay until almost 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors were evacuated during the standoff.
</P>
<P>
   Marino apparently left the house and refused several warnings
from police to drop his high-powered rifle. When he fired several
shots, police returned fire, hitting him six times in the chest.
</P>
<P>
   State troopers and East Greenbush police both responded to the
standoff.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Police Arrest Protesters  </HEADLINE>
By CHARLES HUTZLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Police swiftly broke up scattered Falun Gong
protests on Thursday morning, punching some of the protesters and
dragging them into vans on the first anniversary of the crackdown
on the meditation group.
</P>
<P>
   About 67 people were rounded up in Tiananmen Square. Most
demonstrated individually or in small groups -- sitting in the lotus
position or raising their arms in an O-shape, a popular meditation
pose for the sect.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's display showed that one of China's biggest political
campaigns in years may have thinned the resilient group's ranks but
has failed to wipe the movement.
</P>
<P>
   The protests happened between 8:30 a.m. and 9:30 a.m. when
thousands of school children were visiting the square -- one of
Beijing's most popular tourist sites. Some of the children
witnessed the brutal arrests, and they talked excitedly to each
other about the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Such protests have become routine in the past year, and police,
who frequently use violence in the round-ups, have become efficient
at arresting and hauling away the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, some protesters who weren't cooperating with police
were punched in the chest, stomach and face.
</P>
<P>
   One middle-aged woman in a plum-colored pant suit was sitting
with three other people on the ground in the lotus position when
police questioned her and dragged into a van. Once in the van, she
started shrieking and a police officer punched her repeatedly in
the face. In between blows, he lowered the van's blinds so people
couldn't watch.
</P>
<P>
   As one van drove away with protesters, many of the detainees
could be seen crying. One man put his palms together in a gesture
of prayer and looked at the crowd as he was driven off.
</P>
<P>
   The police presence was extremely thick. Clumps of uniformed
police at the entrance of the square asked some people for ID.
Plainclothes police, whose walkie-talkies made them easy to spot,
trained high-powered binoculars on the square and radioed their
comrades when they spotted a meditator.
</P>
<P>
   The government has branded Falun Gong an unprecedented threat to
communist rule and accused the group of cheating followers and
causing 1,500 deaths, mostly of followers it maintains refused
medical treatment in accordance with what it claims are the group's
teachings.
</P>
<P>
   Founded eight years ago, Falun Gong attracted millions of
followers with its blend of slow-motion exercises, meditation and
ideas drawn from Buddhism, Taoism and its founder.

<HEADLINE> Eagles Talking to White's Agent  </HEADLINE>
By DAN ROBRISH
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Could Reggie White be a Philadelphia Eagle
again?
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles aren't ruling it out, and coach Andy Reid confirmed
Wednesday night that he inquired into White's status after the
NFL's career sack leader has been retired for a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''As I have stated many times, we have an active and aggressive
attitude to at least look into any player that could possibly help
our team,'' Reid said. ''It is true, in that context, that I made
an inquiry about Reggie's status. This was a preliminary
information-seeking call. We are currently investigating to
determine if this situation is worthy of further pursuit.''
</P>
<P>
   White, 38, has also held discussions with the Tennessee Titans
and Seattle Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles are about $7 million under the salary cap, and are in
position to potentially offer White the most money.
</P>
<P>
   White went to Green Bay in April 1993 as possibly the NFL's most
sought-after free agent ever. The longtime Eagles star became an
immediate defensive leader, helping the Packers to the Super Bowl
for the first time in almost three decades in January 1997, when
they beat New England 35-21.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, they again reached the Super Bowl, but lost 31-24
to the Denver Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   White battled lower back spasms caused by a displaced vertebra
in 1997 and still registered 11 sacks that season.
</P>
<P>
   He was set to announce his retirement in 1998 when he changed
his mind and came back for his 14th NFL season. He was voted
defensive player of the year with a conference-best 16 sacks and a
record 13th Pro Bowl berth.
</P>
<P>
   The former Green Bay and Philadelphia star picked up the
nickname ''The Minister of Defense'' in the early 1980s while
playing at Tennessee where he was a team captain and an
All-America. He still holds the Vols' record for sacks in a game
with four and in a season with 15, both in 1983.

<HEADLINE> Brewers 6, Pirates 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Jeff D'Amico pitched a five-hitter for his
first shutout in three years, winning his fourth consecutive start
as the Milwaukee Brewers defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates 6-0
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amico (6-4), who missed all of 1998 and most of last season
after surgery on his right shoulder, recorded his only other
shutout and complete game in a 5-0 victory over Baltimore on June
23, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amico struck out four and walked four. In his last four
starts, he has allowed just one run in 30 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Kris Benson (8-8) allowed four runs on five hits in six innings,
matching his career high with 11 strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates have lost six of seven since the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee took a 2-0 lead with two runs in the fourth inning.
Marquis Grissom hit a sinking liner for a single that bounced past
right fielder John Vander Wal for a two-base error, and Grissom
scored on the play when Vander Wal's eluded the cutoff man for
another error.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers then loaded the bases with one out on a single and
two walks. Jose Hernandez's sacrifice fly made it 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee added two runs in the fifth to extend the lead to 4-0.
Ron Belliard singled with one out, advanced on Grissom's fly out
and scored on Geoff Jenkins' single. Charlie Hayes followed with an
RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers increased the lead to 6-0 in the seventh without a
hit. After Jeff Wallace walked four for one run, Steve Sparks made
his major league debut with the bases loaded and threw a wild pitch
on his first offering.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Benjamin had three singles for Pittsburgh. Jason Kendall's
second-inning single was the only other hit off D'Amico.
Notes: Benson struck out seven of the first nine batters. ... The
Pirates promoted Sparks from Double-A Altoona. Pittsburgh picked
him in the 28th round of the 1998 draft. ... D'Amico pitched
Milwaukee's second complete game of the season. Steve Woodard has
the other one.

<HEADLINE> White Sox 3, Twins 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Brook Fordyce broke out of a 1-for-18 slump
with three hits, including a homer, to back the solid pitching of
rookie left-hander Mark Buehrle as the Chicago White Sox won their
fifth straight game, 3-2 over Minnesota on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox, with a 10&AMP;frac12;-game lead in the AL Central, have
baseball's best record, 60-34, and have won 29 of their last 40
games. They've also won 21 of their last 27 road games and own the
best road record in baseball, 31-17.
</P>
<P>
   Buehrle (1-0), a 21-year old left-hander who had pitched just
one big-league inning, went seven innings and allowed two runs on
six hits. A 38th-round draft pick of the White Sox in 1998, Buehrle
joined the team from Class AA Birmingham on July 16 after going 8-4
with a 2.28 ERA in 16 starts with the Barons.
</P>
<P>
   Buehrle walked one, hit a batter and struck out five. He had the
most trouble with DH David Ortiz, who had three hits. Ortiz added
his fourth hit of the night off Bill Simas in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Foulke pitched 1 2-3 innings for his 17th save.
</P>
<P>
   It took the Sox just six pitches to take command of the game.
Ray Durham hit Eric Milton's second pitch of the game for a double,
and after Tony Graffanino beat out a bunt, Frank Thomas' RBI single
scored Durham.
</P>
<P>
   Two pitches later, Magglio Ordonez's single sent Graffanino home
to make it 2-0. Paul Konerko then singled to right to load the
bases but Milton retired the next three batters to avoid further
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Fordyce led off the second inning with his fourth homer of the
year to make it 3-0. He also singled in the fourth and the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Milton (8-6) settled down after the second and allowed just two
hits over the next five innings, but he still lost his fourth
straight start.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins dented Buehrle for a run in the third when Cristian
Guzman led off with his major league-leading 14th triple and came
home on Matt Lawton's RBI grounder.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, Buehrle hit Jason Maxwell with the bases loaded to
force a home a run and cut the lead to 3-2. But he retired Chad
Moeller on a pop fly to end the threat. He gave way to reliever
Bill Simas in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The struggling Twins suffered another blow when second baseman
Jay Canizaro was forced to leave the game in the second inning with
a lower leg contusion. Canizaro was injured when Graffanino slid
hard into him in an unsuccessful attempt to break up a double play.
Canizaro has been a bright spot for the Twins since coming up from
Class AAA Salt Lake City in May. He is hitting .296 with five home
runs and 23 RBIs in 61 games. His status is day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Chicago extended several hitting streaks Wednesday --
Konerko has a career best 12-game run while Durham and Thomas have
eight-game streaks. ... Guzman's triple leaves him two shy of the
Twins' team record set by Rod Carew in 1977. ... Canizaro wasn't
the only Twin injured. First base coach Jerry White was hit in the
face by Matt Lawton's helmet when the outfielder threw it to the
ground after flying out to end the seventh inning. White stayed on
the ground for a couple of minutes and had to be helped off the
field.

<HEADLINE> Star Football Player Dies on Track  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OPA-LOCKA, Fla. (AP) -- A standout high school football player
who died shortly after he collapsed while exercising had a birth
defect in his heart that could not have been detected through a
medical exam.
</P>
<P>
   Autopsy results released Wednesday by Miami-Dade County's
medical examiner revealed Brian Bell had a birth defect that caused
his right coronary artery to bend at an awkward angle, creating a
blockage of blood. The blockage put even more pressure on the
artery during heavy exercise.
</P>
<P>
   The autopsy also showed Bell had signs of an old heart attack,
but his condition carried no symptoms leading to its detection, the
medical examiner's office said.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, 17, was a student at Monsignor Pace High School.
Miami-Dade Fire Rescue took him to Parkway Regional Medical Center
on Tuesday, where he was pronounced dead upon arrival. Bell would
have been a senior this fall.
</P>
<P>
   A school trainer performed CPR on Bell, who still had a pulse
when he left for the hospital, said Joe Zaccheo, the school's
athletic director and football coach.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is probably the best athlete on the team,'' Zaccheo said.
''I'm talking condition-wise. He probably would have gone to a
Division I school. You had a lot of schools interested in him. This
was a young man who had everything going in the right direction. He
was doing all the right things: working a job, keeping his grades
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell, a 6-foot, 185-pound defensive back who also wrestled at
the school, was a first-team All-Dade County selection last season.
</P>
<P>
   He was working out with the football team Tuesday evening,
having just finished lifting weights and was running laps when he
collapsed at the school, officials said.

<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Sammy Sosa tied the game with an eighth-inning
homer and Brant Brown won it in the ninth by scoring on a wild
pitch as the Chicago Cubs defeated the Philadelphia Phillies 5-4
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's homer, his 29th, tied the game at 3-3. Damon Buford, who
went 4-for-4, followed two outs later with his 13th homer to put
Chicago up 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Gant tied the game off Cubs closer Rick Aguilera with a
leadoff homer in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the inning, Brown singled off reliever Mark
Holzemer (0-1), Eric Young sacrificed him to second and Ricky
Gutierrez blooped a single to center to put runners on the corners.
</P>
<P>
   Holzemer wild-pitched Gutierrez to second, but the ball didn't
bounce far enough away from catcher Tom Prince for Brown to
advance. Two pitches later, however, Holzemer threw the ball to the
backstop and Brown scored easily.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours before the game, Cubs team president Andy MacPhail
accepted general manager Ed Lynch's resignation. MacPhail will
assume the GM duties himself, and Lynch will stay with the team as
a scout.
</P>
<P>
   Two outs after Gant's 18th homer, Aguilera walked Gary Bennett
and hit Doug Glanville with a pitch. Manager Don Baylor removed
Aguilera, who blew his seventh save in 26 chances and was booed
vehemently by the remaining Wrigley Field fans. Felix Heredia (4-3)
struck out Kevin Jordan to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Rolen hit an RBI groundout in the first and Bobby Abreu
hit another in the third to give the Phillies a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Glanville snuffed a Cubs rally in the fourth by throwing out
Gary Matthews, Jr. at the plate with a two-hop throw from about 300
feet. Matthews collided violently with Gary Bennett, but the
catcher held on for the out.
</P>
<P>
   Arias, a .188 hitter coming in, homered in the seventh to make
it 3-0. Glenallen Hill hit an RBI groundout in the seventh to make
it 3-1.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Matthews, Jr. is the son of former Cub and Phillie
outfielder Gary Matthews. ... Reliever Wayne Gomes, on the DL since
July 7 with right elbow tendinitis, had an MRI on Monday that came
back negative. ... Pitcher Robert Person is expected to be
activated from the DL prior to his next start Saturday at
Pittsburgh. ... NFL Hall-of-Famer Roger Staubach and fellow QB Drew
Brees of Purdue sang ''Take Me Out to the Ballgame'' during the
seventh-inning stretch.

<HEADLINE> Camp David Summit Collapses  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- An exhaustive effort to break through a
half-century of Palestinian-Israeli conflict ended in failure
Wednesday night at the wooded presidential sanctuary that had lent
its name to historic success in Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat could not come to terms after nine days of talks shepherded
by President Clinton, and all three headed out from the Camp David
retreat in a dismal rain that matched the day's mood.
</P>
<P>
   ''The summit has come to a conclusion without reaching an
agreement,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said when the
negotiations broke up shortly before 11 p.m. EDT.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, his face sagging with weariness during several
practically all-night sessions, returned to the White House to
prepare to fly almost immediately to Japan for an international
economic conference.
</P>
<P>
   He was a day late in leaving, having hung back in hopes of
pulling off a deal with Barak and Arafat at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   No details of the final hang-ups were immediately disclosed, but
Jerusalem was believed to be the main problem. Clinton was
understood to have pressed the two leaders to accept a U.S.-crafted
compromise on Jerusalem's future and other core issues, including
the disposition of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had hoped for a breakthrough that would be in keeping
with the spirit of the Camp David accords brokered in these same
Catoctin Mountains by President Carter in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the summit ended in familiar recriminations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Israelis are responsible for the failure of the summit,''
said Hassan Abdel Rachman, the PLO's Washington envoy. ''We came to
the summit with an open spirit to reach an agreement, but the
Israeli stance was not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ''Barak was negotiating with his own (Jewish) settlers, and not
the Palestinians.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak was expected to issue a statement later.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, in briefing reporters, Lockhart had indicated time was
running out, saying no one saw any value in ''staying on forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met with Arafat even as Lockhart briefed reporters on
the situation. The president had met earlier with Barak. The two
principals in the talks did not meet face to face during the day,
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Arafat were under pressure to find common ground on
such contentious issues as the future of Jerusalem, the fate of 2
million to 4 million Palestinian refugees and their descendants,
the size of a Palestinian state on the West Bank and in Gaza and
the number of Jewish settlements to remain in the territories.
</P>
<P>
   Israel radio and television reported Barak had written to
Clinton complaining that the Palestinians had not gone to Camp
David to negotiate in good faith.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Palestinians arrived at Camp David lacking a true
commitment, and are not ready to have a substantive discussion
about a lasting peace and to make historic decisions,'' Israel
radio quoted a Hebrew translation of the letter. ''Unless there are
last-minute changes, the Palestinians will have to envision the
tragic consequences of an opportunity they missed.''
</P>
<P>
   Rahman sought to rebut the prime minister. The PLO envoy said
the Palestinians went to Camp David to achieve a just and lasting
peace that the Israeli and Palestinian people could live with for
generations.
</P>
<P>
   ''This peace does not deal with balance of forces but balance of
interests,'' Rahman told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   He contended that in the talks Israel sought to impose
settlement terms on the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Clinton made telephone calls to four other leaders
in the Middle East ''to give them some sense of where we are in
this process.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said the president had received written communications
from Arafat as well as Barak. He did not describe Arafat's letter,
except that it was different in nature and substance from that
Barak's letter complaining that the Palestinians were not
negotiating in good faith.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why they would send letters to Clinton when they were
sitting in talks with him, Lockhart said that was a question for
them, not him.
</P>
<P>
   He said repeatedly that the sessions couldn't keep going as they
have. ''There comes a time when you have to get on with the other
business that's before you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Jerusalem, Barak signaled before and during the summit that
he was willing to give the Palestinians more control over Arab
neighborhoods and to expand the area beyond the city. In exchange,
Israel would absorb some Jewish settlement into the western part of
the city.
</P>
<P>
   But Rahman, the PLO official, said, ''There can be no agreement
without total Palestinian sovereignty over east Jerusalem. This is
a basic condition for achieving peace.''

<HEADLINE> China Braces for Falun Gong Struggle  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- China's leaders are settling in for a prolonged
struggle against the banned Falun Gong sect, acknowledging in an
official editorial that a year of arrests, harassment and political
campaigns have failed to wipe out the group.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the statement, as the anniversary of a government
crackdown on the Falun Gong arrived Thursday, police dispersed
scores of protesters and detained more than 90 of them in Tiananmen
Square.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's display showed that one of China's biggest political
campaigns in years may have thinned the resilient group's ranks but
has failed to wipe the movement.
</P>
<P>
   The protests happened between 8:30 a.m. and 9:30 a.m. when
thousands of school children were visiting the square -- one of
Beijing's most popular tourist sites. Some of the children
witnessed the brutal arrests, and they talked excitedly to each
other about the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The group's resilience was grudgingly acknowledged in an
editorial to be published Thursday in the Communist Party's
flagship People's Daily. Excerpts were carried Wednesday on the
official Xinhua News Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''The cult will not voluntarily step down from the historical
stage,'' Xinhua quoted the article as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The fight against Falun Gong will be a ''long-lasting,
complicated and acute struggle,'' it said, and pledged to crack
down on members with a ''firm hand.''
</P>
<P>
   In a reference to the group's founder, a former government clerk
whose whereabouts are now unknown, Xinhua quoted the editorial as
saying: ''Li Hongzhi and his followers, like any evil force, have
never stopped doing illegal things.''
</P>
<P>
   A media smear campaign, the jailings of thousands of members and
pressure on followers to renounce ties to the group have thinned
Falun Gong's ranks. But the group has continued to launch defiant
protests, mounting the most sustained public challenge to the
Communist Party in 51 years.
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing on Wednesday, scores of Falun Gong followers raised
banners in Tiananmen Square, prompting a frenzied response by
police who swarmed on groups of protesters, wresting away banners
and knocking them to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Police dragged protesters by the arms or clothes -- middle-aged
women and children among them. A uniformed officer locked his arms
around a woman's neck, pulling her away.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 Falun Gong members were detained during the
protest, a 10-minute explosion of seemingly coordinated action
across the vast plaza.
</P>
<P>
   That the protests happened -- and in such numbers -- was
particularly impressive in the face of police alertness in the days
before Thursday's anniversary on the crackdown on Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
   One year ago Thursday, security agents detained dozens of key
Falun Gong organizers. Sect followers, tipped off by fellow members
in the upper ranks of the communist government, responded with mass
protests. Two days later, Chinese leaders outlawed Falun Gong,
declaring it a public menace.
</P>
<P>
   Police have picked up at least 200 practitioners from Tiananmen
Square every day for the past week, according to a Communist Party
official involved in security work.
</P>
<P>
   Police in Beijing and other cities have watched airports and
railroad and bus stations to prevent followers from reaching the
capital, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Followers have been put under surveillance or detained, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Still some have slipped through our net,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The government has branded Falun Gong an unprecedented threat to
communist rule and accused the group of cheating followers and
causing 1,500 deaths, mostly of followers it maintains refused
medical treatment in accordance with what it claims are the group's
teachings.
</P>
<P>
   Founded eight years ago, Falun Gong attracted millions of
followers with its blend of slow-motion exercises, meditation and
ideas drawn from Buddhism, Taoism and its founder.
</P>
<P>
   Followers arrested in recent days have refused to tell officers
their names or hometowns, making it difficult for city police to
file the proper arrest forms, the party official said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, police have commandeered a stadium in western Beijing
to hold those detained until their hometowns can be determined and
they can be shipped off to local detention centers, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
   A human rights group based in Hong Kong, meanwhile, said it has
confirmed the deaths of 24 Falun Gong followers over the past year
due to mistreatment while in detention.
</P>
<P>
   Although the government has not responded to each alleged death,
it has denied Falun Gong followers are mistreated in custody.
