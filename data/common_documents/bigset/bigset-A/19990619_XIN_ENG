<HEADLINE> Bahraini Emir's Visit to Boost Ties with Egypt: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The upcoming visit to Egypt by the
Bahraini emir will have "a decisive role" in deepening relations
between the two Arab countries, Bahraini ambassador in Cairo said
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Egypt's Middle East News Agency, Ibrahim
al Maged said that Bahraini Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Isa al Khalifa
"is looking forward to the visit" slated for Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hamad "is also looking forward to meeting with" Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak during the visit, which is Hamad's first
trip to Egypt since he assumed power in March after the death of
his father, al Maged said.
</P>
<P>
The Bahraini ambassador said that Hamad's coming visit and his
talks with Mubarak are part of the continued consultations between
the two sides on bilateral ties and regional issues of mutual
concern.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders will discuss ways of bolstering bilateral
economic and trade cooperation, Maged said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed belief that the visit will promote the
implementation of an economic agreement signed in l997 on free
trade.
</P>
<P>
Al Maged underlined his country's keenness on promoting ties
with Egypt in various fields, especially in economy and trade.
</P>
<P>
Hamad and Mubarak will also deal with regional issues,
especially the Middle East peace process, the Bahraini diplomat
said.
</P>
<P>
Hopes of reviving the Arab-Israeli peace talks increased after
moderate leader of Israel's Labor Party Ehud Barak was elected the
Jewish state's prime minister. Arab leaders are seeking ways of
forging a unified stance on the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Civilian Injured in U.S. Air Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 18 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi civilian was injured on
Friday in U.S.-British air strikes on civilian facilities in
northern Iraq, an Iraqi military spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed spokesman said that at 11:00 (0700 GMT), eight
formations of enemy warplanes coming from the Turkish airspace
violated northern Iraqi airspace over Dohuk, Erbil and Neineva
provinces, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The enemy planes bombed civilian facilities in the region,
leading to the injury of one civilian and destruction of some
civilian buildings, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He added that Iraqi anti-aircraft artillery fired back and
repulsed the enemy planes.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 10:20 (0620 GMT) and 17:20 (1320
GMT), a total of 37 formations of enemy planes coming from Saudi
and Kuwaiti bases violated southern Iraqi airspace over Thi-Qar,
Basra, Misan, Muthana, Qadisiya and Najaf provinces.
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S. and Britain launched airstrikes against Iraq
last December, their warplanes have made 1,679 and 7,067 sorties
over the so-called northern and southern no-fly zones
respectively, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones in Iraq
following the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of protecting the
Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims from possible attacks by
the Iraqi troops.
</P>
<P>
Since last December's four-night bombardment of Iraqi targets,
U.S. and British warplanes have been regularly attacking Iraqi
civilian and military targets, causing severe civilian casualties
and property damage.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG , June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Inkatha Freedom Party
(IFP) and African National Congress (ANC) in KwaZulu-Natal said
Friday the provincial coalition government between them would work
toward improving the lives of the poor.
</P>
<P>
The IFP and ANC reached an agreement Thursday to form a
coalition government in order to create peace and an environment
conducive to the socio-economic development of the poorest of the
poor and to contribute to good governance in KwaZulu-Natal.
</P>
<P>
The agreement followed a number of meetings between the two
parties to decide who would become the provincial premier. The
position eventually went to incumbent and IFP national chairman
Lionel Mtshali after the ANC withdrew its nomination of its
provincial chairman S'bu Ndebele.
</P>
<P>
Mtshali said Friday, "We have committed ourselves to placing
the needs of the province first. We will work together and ensure
that required resources are available."
</P>
<P>
He said the provincial government was faced with a challenge to
fulfill the agreement and to ensure that the constitution
addressed issues concerning traditional leaders.
</P>
<P>
Ndebele said the coalition government was dedicated to peace
and development and was not against the people of the province.
</P>
<P>
"This province will no longer be a source of instability. We
have stated it clearly that our responsibility is to take the lead
and unite our people. "
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the premiership, Ndebele said: "This position
will not rotate -- let us unite around one premier."
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties welcomed the formation of the coalition
government in principle. However, they chose to "withhold their
right to vote" on the coalition agreement when it was tabled in
the legislature, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the issue of the provincial capital, both
Mtshali and Ndebele said the matter would be dealt with once all
urgent matters had been finalized.

<HEADLINE> Feature: U.N., FIFA Join Hands for A Better World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Two blue flags were flying
shoulder by shoulder Friday on a United Nations lawn, symbol of a
happy marriage between two global organizations -- the United
Nations and the Federation of International Football Association
(FIFA).
</P>
<P>
Teenage football players were gathering together at the lawn,
where miniature goals were erected. Smile were visible on faces of
the potential footballers, standing alongside with U.N. officials
to attend a joint U.N.-FIFA press conference.
</P>
<P>
"I am very pleased to announce today a new partnership between
the only truly global organization -- the United Nations, and the
only truly global sport -- football," U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said. "This is a great match-up."
</P>
<P>
Annan made the announcement on the eve of the official opening
of the FIFA Women's World Cup, to be inaugurated Saturday by the
U.N. chief at Giants Stadium, New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
"FIFA has agreed to fly the United Nations flag at all World
Cup Games, beginning with the Women's World Cup series that I will
be opening tomorrow," he said.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first FIFA Football competition officially
flying the U.N. flags as a visible symbol for the uniting function
of football, but not the last: from this day on every FIFA world
competition will be waving U.N. flag, reminding the players of
fair play, mutual acceptance and observance of the commonly agreed
rules.
</P>
<P>
"Only football is as universal in scope and participation as
the United Nations," he said, "Football is a common language
transcending differences of cultural, religious, social and racial
backgrounds," he said.
</P>
<P>
A native of the football nation Ghana, Annan said he himself
was "an avid football player through college, and I am still an
ardent football fan."
</P>
<P>
"As Secretary-General, I might be thought of as captain of the
team. More often, however, I feel like the goalie having to make
last-second saves rather than seeing the team follow my lead," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"But as you know well, we all have to play different roles to
achieve common aims. That is why we at the United Nations welcomed
FIFA's participation in many of our programs -- from racial and
gender equality to health, development, education, and the rights
of children," he said.
</P>
<P>
"FIFA has been sending thousands of footballs to the Kosovar
refugees, helping to give them, and particularly the children,
some respite from the misery they have suffered," he said, "I hope
FIFA will be able to expand this wonderful program to children in
need all over the world."
</P>
<P>
Also attending the press conference were FIFA President Joseph
Blatter, the world-known Brazilian football star, Pele and U.S.
female football star Kristine Lilly.
</P>
<P>
"The world would be a little better if it were a little more
like a football field," said the FIFA president.
</P>
<P>
With its some 300 million football players and its countless
fans in over 203 countries and territories, its stars and models,
its emotions, rules and diversity, football is an ideal platform
to illustrate some of the values and programs that the United
Nations are ready to promote.
</P>
<P>
Of the world total, 80 percent are youth football players, the
president said, and about 40 million of them are girls and women.
</P>
<P>
"Football is the game for everybody," and the U.N.-FIFA
partnership is for the benefit of the youths worldwide, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president has adopted a philosophical approach to the
football games, in which one has to learn to fight, learn to win
and learn to lose.
</P>
<P>
"Even at the end of my football career, if I am not a better
football player, at least I had become a better human being," he
said. "In this humanitarian aspect, football can serve as an
instrument to realize ideas of the United Nations."

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Defeats Gun Control Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Republican-controlled House
voted 280-147 to reject a gun control bill Friday that would have
lessened some current restrictions on the sale of weapons at gun
shows.
</P>
<P>
The rejection came at the end of a tumultuous three-day debate
as lawmakers struggled to respond to this spring's high school
shootings in Colorado and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
The vote leaves the fate of gun control legislation uncertain.
The Senate last month approved stronger restrictions, and
compromise talks with the House are likely to begin this summer.
</P>
<P>
The developments came several hours after a midnight vote in
which the National Rifle Association (NRA) prevailed on an
amendment to loosen restrictions on sales at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House voted 218-211 late Thursday evening to loosen
restrictions on sales at gun shows, handing a victory to the NRA
and a blow to the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
Clinton "isn't interested in signing into law any NRA-sponsored
legislation that opens more loopholes than it closes," his
spokesman, Joe Lockhart, told reporters Friday.
</P>
<P>
In response to the vote, Clinton, who is attending a world
economic conference in Cologne, Germany, said, "instead of closing
the deadly gun-show loophole, the House of Representatives voted
in the dead of night to let criminals keep buying guns at gun
shows."
</P>
<P>
Clinton vowed to "keep working until Congress stands up to the
gun lobby and makes the common sense measures passed by the Senate
the law of the land."
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Janet Reno also said Friday that the vote is
"a very big step backwards" and "incomprehensible."
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the measure said it would help restore the rights
of law-abiding citizens, but opponents said it would make it
easier for criminals to get guns by not allowing enough time to
check gun buyers.
</P>
<P>
The NRA-backed amendment by Democratic Representative John
Dingell, a former NRA board member, would require all gun-show
buyers to undergo background checks within 24 hours rather than
three days as approved by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton government launched a campaign to tighten gun
control in American after the Kolorado campus shooting in April,
in which 15 people were killed. But the powerful NRA strongly
lobbied against stricter gun control in Congress.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday evening, the House approved by 287-139 a three-year
1.5 billion dollar juvenile crime bill that would stiffen
penalties against juvenile offenders.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Claims Repulsing Eritrean Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia announced Friday
evening that the Ethiopian defense forces "effectively repulsed
attacks" by the Eritrean army on the main Mereb River front from
Monday to Thursday (June 14-17).
</P>
<P>
A press statement issued here by the office of the Ethiopian
government spokesperson Selome Taddesse claimed that the Ethiopian
forces put "3,420 enemy forces out of action" during the four-day
fighting.
</P>
<P>
The office also accused one Eritrean brigade of initiating
another offensive on the right wing of the main Mereb River
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It claimed that the Ethiopian forces "successfully repelled
this attack" and "130 Eritrean military personnel were killed,
wounded or captured".
</P>
<P>
The latest border fighting on the vicinity of the Mereb River
between Ethiopian and Eritrean forces started on June 9, this
year. Both sides accused the other side of starting the attack and
claimed putting "over 20, 000 enemy soldiers" out of action during
the latest military engagement.
</P>
<P>
Both Ethiopia and Eritrea have accepted the framework agreement
of the high delegation of the Organization of African Unity.
However, the two sides haven't yet reached a cease-fire on their
over one-year border conflict.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Decides Delay of Moving U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton has
decided to delay moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to
Jerusalem for at least six months, U.S. officials said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
A law passed by Congress in 1995 decreed that the embassy
should move by the end of 1999 but also gave the president the
power to postpone the move in the so-called national interest.
</P>
<P>
An administration official and a spokesman for Senator Daniel
Moynihan said the president had invoked his power to waive the
requirement to carry out the move.
</P>
<P>
A White House statement issued in Cologne, where Clinton is
attending a Group of Eight summit, said the president invoked his
waiver power "in order to protect our critical national security
interests, most crucially in preserving the prospects for a
comprehensive, just and lasting peace."
</P>
<P>
Moynihan, a New York Democrat and strong supporter of Israel,
quoted Clinton as saying he had taken the step because of his
concerns for the Middle East peace process and his desire to
ensure continued funding for U.S. embassies.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians, who claim Arab East Jerusalem as the capital
of their future state, have said moving the embassy would be a
major setback to the U.S. role as mediator with Israel.

<HEADLINE> KFOR to Make Lasting Peace in Kosovo: Solana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana said on Friday that the international peacekeeping force
KFOR will play its full part in making peace in Kosovo a lasting
one.
</P>
<P>
The chief of the western military alliance made the comment
after an extraordinary joint council meeting of its foreign and
defense ministers here at the NATO headquarters.
</P>
<P>
He told the press after the meeting that the Yugoslav army had
been withdrawing from Kosovo in compliance with the agreement
reached between Yugoslavia and NATO.
</P>
<P>
KFOR, he added, will be even-handed in its dealing with the
ethnic peoples in the province.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav forces were withdrawing; KFOR troops were deploying,
and refugees were returning, said the NATO chief.
</P>
<P>
Solana also said that KFOR General Michael Jackson was expected
to reach an agreement on disarmament of the Albanian Liberation
Army with the army's leaders within hours or days "in any case".
</P>
<P>
"The alliance is determined to help create a peaceful,
multi-ethnic and democratic Kosovo within the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia," said Solana in a statement delivered to the council
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The council meeting expected that Yugoslavia completes the
agreed full withdrawal of its security forces and that the
Albanian Liberation Army and other armed groups in Kosovo
cooperate with KFOR and refrain from any violence, particularly
any provocations against departing Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav forces are expected to pull out of Kosovo
completely by midnight Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Opposition Leader Arraigned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 18 (Xinhua) -- National Chairman of the
opposition Tanzania People's Party (TPP) Aleck Che-mponda and his
five followers were arraigned Friday before a court in capital Dar
es Salaam to answer charges of unlawful demonstration.
</P>
<P>
Inspector of Police James Kasusula claimed before judges that
the accused persons failed to submit a written notification at
least 48 hours before they staged a demonstration at the gate of
the State House Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The police officer told the Kisutu Resident Magistrate's Court
that the accused took part in the procession while knowing that it
was unlawful.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Inspector Taraja Chibumbu claimed that the accused
behaved in a disorder manner in the same day at the Central Police
Station by shouting: "We want good life for whom? For all."
</P>
<P>
The opposition leader and his followers denied charges before
Principal Resident Magistrate, Gabriel Rwekibarila and senior
district magistrate Newton Mwankenja, in two different court
chambers.
</P>
<P>
Che-mponda and his followers were stopped Thursday morning by
the police some 60 meters away from the gate of the State House.
The group were demanding the government release subsidies to the
opposition parties for campaigns in the by-election at Ubungo and
Temeke constituencies in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
The 64-year-old opposition leader told a press conference
Wednesday in the city that according to the National Electoral
Commission's 1995 election guidelines, all political parties were
supposed to get subsidies but he wondered why the opposition
parties were denied.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Cha-mponda ran for the presidency but later withdrew
from the general elections. The reason, as he explained in January
this year, was that he was not able to pay one million shillings
(about 1,400 U.S. dollars) of deposit money to the electoral
commission.
</P>
<P>
He was also unlucky in the following years -- ran and lost as
candidate for the parliamentary seat in Kinodoni constituency in
Dar es Salaam in 1995, and lost again in the 1996 Temeke
parliamentary by-election.
</P>
<P>
The case comes up for preliminary hearing on July 2 as
investigation is incomplete.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Give Priority to Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
Friday declared 1999/2000 as a special year of agriculture to
increase the importance of the sector in the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Addressing parliament in central Dodoma, Prime Minister
Frederick Sumaye said that agriculture and livestock keeping
constitutes a key sector of Tanzania's economy in the new fiscal
year starting July 1.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye said his office will form a small committee of
agricultural experts and some politicians who will make a deep
analysis of the problems affecting the country's agriculture and
methods to solve them.
</P>
<P>
The premier urged Tanzanians to abandon the habit of waiting
for free food from donors, which he said is "a big shame." He
added that all efforts should be made to increase food production.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of private sector in agriculture, as
"the government is not a good businessman," according to reports
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's agriculture accounts for approximately half of the
gross domestic product (GDP). Last year, the sector was hit
heavily by a prolonged drought which resulted in food shortages in
more than 10 regions.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the prime minister said it is necessary to attract
private investors to develop agriculture.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that with the involvement of private
investments, mining and tourism sectors have grown rapidly,
becoming pillars in the country's economy and contributing
positively to the government coffers.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye further announced government plans to check against
various disasters including floods and crop diseases, plans for
preparation of a national disaster policy, disaster alleviation
strategies and training of the ways of monitoring disasters.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Plans to Balance Trade by 2017 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has formulated a plan to
balance its foreign trade by the year 2017, the end of the
country's seventh five-year plan, Ahmed Gowaili, minister of
trade and supply said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Gowaili made the remarks in a speech read out by his aide for
trade affairs Ahmad Nasser to a seminar on trade in the
Mediterranean port of Alexandria, 220 kilometers northwest of
Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Gowaili said that Egypt will first try to increase its exports
by 20 percent by the year 2012, the country's Middle East News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has had a huge unfavorable balance of trade. In 1998,
Egypt's imports reached 16.55 billion U.S. dollars while exports
stood at only 5.33 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Gowaili said the strategy for developing Egypt's exports is
based on upgrading the quality of the products and expanding the
use of modern technology.
</P>
<P>
A study has been prepared on means of overcoming obstacles to
the full and efficient control of the quality of Egyptian
products, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He called on Egyptian to set up joint ventures with foreign
businessmen and investors in the country's trade zones.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is seeking ways to expand its exports, including holding
trade promotion fairs in foreign countries, clinching trade
agreements with other countries and negotiating free trade
agreements with Arab, African and European countries.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Minister of
Education Genet Zewde said Friday the country's primary school
coverage has increased to 41. 8 percent now from 34.7 percent 18
months ago.
</P>
<P>
The minister contributed the increase to the educational
development program launched in the Horn of Africa country 18
months ago, the Ethiopian News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Genet said the enrollment of girls has been up from 20 percent
18 months ago to today's 28 percent. The supply of educational
material also improved.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, she added, much has yet to be done to cut the
number of school drop-outs, improve students' performance and
narrow the gap between male and female student population.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian government has allocated 1.62 billion U.S.
dollars for the execution of the five-year education sector
development program which came into effect last year.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Friday called upon Kosovar Albanians to return home and
Serbians remain in the Serbian province of Kosovo, showing "utmost
restraint and patience" so that it will be helpful to create a
peaceful, democratic and multi-ethnic society.
</P>
<P>
"I appeal to all parties and every citizen of Kosovo to show
utmost restraint and patience as the long and hard work of
peace-building and restruction begins," Annan said in a written
statement, "The United Nations and KFOR (the Kosovo peacekeeping
force) -- the people of Kosovo -- create a peaceful, democratic
and multi-ethnic society."
</P>
<P>
"I urge the Kosovar Albanian population to return to their
homes -- but to be patient to do so with the aid and assistance of
KFOR and the United Nations," he said. "I urge the Serbian
population in Kosovo to remain in their homes and do their part to
return Kosovo to a life of peaceful coexistence among all
communities."
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations and KFOR are committed to ensuring the
safety and security of all the people of Kosovo, regardless of
ethnic background," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I urge all parties to recommit themselves to creating a life
of peaceful coexistence, which is the foundation for lasting peace
in Kosovo, and throughout the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan made the appeal as the United Nations is considering how
to divide responsibilities among the world body, the European
Union, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in
humanitarian assistance and the post-war reconstruction under the
June 10 Security Council resolution.

CAIRO, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Slovenian Prime Minister Janez

on economic ties and regional issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day visit, Drnovsek will hold talks with his
Egyptian counterpart Kamal El-Ganzouri, who greeted him at Cairo
International airport.
</P>
<P>
The talks will deal with ways of activating bilateral
cooperation in trade, investment and setting up joint ventures,
according to Egypt's Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Slovenia signed two agreements last year respectively
on protecting reciprocal investments and enhancing cooperation in
the fields of industry, science and technology.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are considering setting up a joint
ministerial committee aimed at seeking ways of boosting
cooperation.

El-Ganzouri and Drnovsek will also discuss the Mideast peace
process and the situation in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Slovenian Ambassador in Cairo Andrej Zlebnik told the news

Slovenia and Egypt, terming the bilateral ties as time-honored.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Zambia, Angola to Improve Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government has
withdrawn allegations that Zambia was involved in supplying arms
to the National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)
rebel movement in that country and called for improving ties
between them.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a
statement released here Friday that Zambia had accepted the
proposal by Angola to forget the past and start on a new chapter.
</P>
<P>
He said the agreement was reached at the second meeting of
chiefs of intelligence from both countries which took place on
June 9 in Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting Zambia accepted the proposal by Angola to forget
the past misunderstanding and open a new chapter in the relations
between the two countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Zambia and Angola further agreed on measures
aimed at improving the relations between them which include
holding regular meetings and reactivating the existing joint
permanent commission on defense and security.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the agreement was a significant development
toward normalizing relations between the two countries which
soured following persistent accusations of gun-running for UNITA.
</P>
<P>
Angola had been persistently accusing Zambia of providing
logistical and military support to the Jonas Savimbi-led UNITA
rebel movement fighting the government of President Edwardo dos
Santos.
</P>
<P>
Some Zambians, including prominent government leaders had been
accused of being involved in the supply of guns and other
logistical support to Angola.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government, however, denied all the charges and
challenged Angola to prove the allegations.
</P>
<P>
At the Swaziland meeting the two countries agreed that a
ministerial meeting be held as soon as possible to arrange for a
summit to the heads of state of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Zambia was represented by foreign affairs minister Kelly
Walubita at the meeting which was also attended by chiefs of
intelligence from Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Expert: NATO Strikes Pollute Much of Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Large areas of Yugoslavia will be
regarded as hazardous for at least 20 to 30 years because of NATO
missile and air strikes, a Russian scientist said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Alexei Yablokov, a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences
specializing in ecology, said over 1,000 cruise missiles that hit
Yugoslavia during the 78-day war emitted large amounts of carbon
dioxide during their flights.
</P>
<P>
As a result, acid rain has fallen on Yugoslavia and neighboring
countries, the Interfax news agency quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
NATO destroyed 995 buildings, in particular about 20 plants
which used strong chemicals in their processes.
</P>
<P>
Masses of fish died in the Danube in April and May as a result
of water pollution by petrochemical products. Black Sea dolphins
found dead in the river delta had also probably been poisoned by
that pollution, Yablokov said.
</P>
<P>
The destruction of dozens of electric power stations has
resulted in the contamination of large areas with
polychloridephenyls, which are cooling agents that are among the
worst pollutants. They can stay stable for decades and poison
crops.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people were poisoned, hundreds of them lethally,
with poisonous clouds of organic pollutants such as dioxines,
phenols and lead and mercury compounds, according to Yugoslav
ecological organizations.
</P>
<P>
The use of weapons with depleted uranium by NATO is a cause for
special concern, Yablokov said, noting that the incidence of
miscarriages, children with birth defects and cancer is likely to
increase within years.
</P>
<P>
In addition, about 25,000 sorties of high altitude flights by
NATO planes did much to destroy the earth's ozone layer, Yablokov
said. "The thinning of the ozone layer will harm every country of
the northern hemisphere, in particular Canada and the United
States."

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriot Leader Accuses G-8 of Involving in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot Leader Rauf
Denktas Friday accused G-8 countries of involving in the
long-disputed Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
In a June 10 statement, G-8s' foreign ministers called for
immediate resumption of the dialog between the Cypriot sides with
no preconditions, and the Cyprus issue will be also on the agenda
of G-8s' summit in Cologne.
</P>
<P>
Denktas said the G-8 countries are in an approach to satisfy
the Greek Cypriot side, according to a report of Turkey's Anatolia
News Agency reaching here from Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
He said the Cyprus issue can be solved among Turkey, Greece,
the Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots, adding that interference
with the Cyprus question from outside further encourages the
Greek Cypriot side.
</P>
<P>
"Don't interfere with the Cyprus issue from outside. The
more others interfere with this issue, the more uncompromising
attitude the Greek Cypriot side has," added Denktas.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry Deputy Spokesman Sermet Atacanli has
also said that Turkey disapproves of the G-8 countries'
initiative regarding the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the G-8s do not have the authority to
call on the two sides on Cyprus to restart dialog.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriots-controlled north since 1974 when
the Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of
the island in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Pessimistic About Quick Settlement of DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government has
expressed great disappointment in meetings over the crisis in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) held in parallel to the
inaugural ceremonies of new South African President Thabo Mbeki
early this week.
</P>
<P>
''Rwanda was disappointed that no progress was made in
resolving the war in the DRC,'' Patrick Mazimhaka, Minister in the
President's Office, told the Rwanda News Agency (RNA) Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mazimhaka said DRC President Laurent Kabila's allies persist in
not recognizing the Congolese rebels as key players in the DRC
crisis and that they cannot meet them.
</P>
<P>
He refuted reports that Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu met
 Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in Pretoria and made a new proposal
for ending the war in DRC.
</P>
<P>
''No new proposal was made,'' Mazimhaka told RNA. ''The
president only repeated Rwanda's usual stand to Gaddafi who was
ill-informed by the Kabila government and its allies.''
</P>
<P>
According to Mazimhaka, President Bizimungu hammered Rwanda's
need for security granted by a stable regime in the DRC which
caters for the security of its neighbors, that does not back those
who perpetrated genocide in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
"We repeated to Gaddafi that we want the 'Interahamwe' militia
disbanded and handed over to us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Mazimhaka added that Gaddafi was briefed by Bizimungu that the
genocide in Rwanda has its roots in the colonialism and that
supporting those who committed it were agents of the same
colonialists.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda also expressed pessimism about the forthcoming meeting
on DRC crisis in Lusaka next week. Mazimhaka said there has been
no serious preparation and that it was doomed to not reach any
tangible results.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda deployed troops in eastern DRC where they are fighting
alongside Congolese rebels fighting to remove Kabila. The rebels
are also backed by Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Kabila has received military support from Zimbabwe, Namibia,
Angola and Chad, but this has not stopped the rebels to capture
almost half of the huge central African state.
</P>
<P>
Attempts to resolve the more than 10-month-old civil war in the
third largest African country have failed due to Kabila's refusal
to engage in direct talks with his foes.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOGNE, June 18 (Xinhua)-Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Stepashin Friday at the Group of Seven (G-7) and Russia summit
demanded an impartial peace solution in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"It is impermissible that one refugee stream be stopped and
another leave the region," said Stepashin, stressing, " there
should be an impartial peace for everyone."
</P>
<P>
While NATO peacekeeping force being deployed in Kosovo,
thousands Serb refugees are reportedly fleeing the region.
</P>
<P>
Having solved its greatest economic problems, Russia will also
as a critical partner to take part in the discussion and
cooperation on economic issues at the summit, said Stepashin.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of world's leading industrial nations, including
British Prime Minister Tony Blair, French President Jaques Chirac,
Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema, Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien, and Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, and the U.S.
President Bill Clinton, are attending the summit hosted by German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin arrived in Cologne on Friday afternoon to take part
in the first stage discussion of the summit instead of his
President Boris Yeltsin, who was due to attend the meeting on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The summit has been expected to focus on world economic and
financial issues, but it is overshadowed by the wrangle between
Russia and the West in Kosovo.

<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Libyan Leader Moammar Gaddafi
arrived here on Friday aboard a private plane on a three-day state
visit to Sudan.
</P>
<P>
He was welcomed at the airport by Sudanese President Omar
Al-Bashir and other senior officials as well as members of the
diplomatic corps.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan leader is expected to probe with Bashir a Libyan
initiative on reconciliation among the Sudanese conflicting
parties, sources close to the Sudanese presidency said.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi will also exchange views with the Sudanese government
and its opponents to bring close the viewpoints of the two rival
sides in the country, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
Earlier he met with chief of the opposition Congress Party
Mohammed Othman Al-Marghani and leader of the Nation Party
Al-Sadiq Al-Mahdi in Tripoli, capital of Libya, and Sert, a Libyan
coastal city respectively.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he met the Sudanese government delegation led by
First Deputy President Ali Osman Taha. However, such meetings
failed to reach agreement on direct talks between the Sudanese
government and opposition.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi was initially scheduled to arrive here on Thursday but
adjourned the visit for one day without giving official
explanations.

five people were killed and 10 others injured when a minibus
hit a truck, the news agency said, without giving details.

<HEADLINE> Standing Committee on Somalia Holds Meeting in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Standing Committee on
Somalia made up of 17 countries and organizations interested in
contributing to the establishment of peace and national
reconciliation in Somalia held its fifth meeting in Ethiopia's
capital on Friday.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry said the
participants exchanged views on the current situation in Somalia
and the effect of the crisis on neighboring countries and the
region as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the committee adopted the report of, and a
document regarding the conclusions from, its fact finding mission
to Hargeisa, Garwe and Bossasso in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
The meeting concluded from its visits to the areas known as
"Somaliland" and "Puntland" that the ideas behind the peace
process of the Inter- Governmental Authority on Development
(IGAD), namely the concentration on strengthening peace and
stability at the regional level in Somalia, represents a positive
step in the process of the building of peace in Somalia as a
whole, according to the Ethiopian News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The committee recommended the need to support the effectiveness
of local governance as well as the return of refugees from
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The committee also suggested that support be given to economic
and physical infrastructural projects in the two regions visited
to enhance trade and integration in Somalia and the sub-region as
a whole.
</P>
<P>
In reviewing the current situation in Somalia, the committee
expressed the importance of pursuing the path laid out by the IGAD
initiative while exploring ideas that would contribute to speeding
up the process of peace and national reconciliation in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The standing committee on Somalia, chaired by Ethiopia, was
established in October 1998 as a consultative body to build
international consensus behind the IGAD peace initiative on
Somalia.

<HEADLINE> Angolan FM Holds Talks with Former U.N. Special </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Former United Nations special envoy
to Angola Issa Diallo held talks Friday with Angolan Foreign
Minister Joao Miranda on the country's serious civil war
situation.
</P>
<P>
Diallo, who arrived here Thursday with the mandate of the U.N.
Secretary- General Kofi Annan, told the press after the talks that
this is the continuation of consultations between the U.N. and the
Angolan government since the U.N. observation mission withdrew
from the southern African country in March of this year.
</P>
<P>
According to Diallo, the U.N. and the Angolan government have
no difference regarding the issue of putting the conflict to an
end as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated once again the necessity for the U.N. to
establish a standing body in Angola so as to keep abreast with the
developments in the country.
</P>
<P>
Miranda, referring the meeting as constructive, said however it
is far- fetched to relate the meeting to restoring dialog with the
opposition National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA).
</P>
<P>
The United Nations cannot force a full-fledged member like
Angola to change its position to negotiate with the rebel military
group (UNITA), said the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Diallo was appointed the U.N. special envoy to Angola last
year to take the place of Alioune Blondin Beye who had died in a
plane accident.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations ended its observer mission in Angola in
February this year following Angolan government's accusation of
the poor performance on the part of U.N. peacekeeping forces and
its insistence of armed settlement with the opposition National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Diallo therefore left here on March 15.
</P>
<P>
With the stalemate in the Angolan crisis, more people at home
and abroad are calling for peaceful dialog between the Angolan
government and the UNITA.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that Diallo's current visit to Angola
has much to do with this particular backdrop.  But Angola's
official sources said the visit is merely confined to the
humanitarian situation in the country.

<HEADLINE> China Qualify with Maximum Points </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 18 (Xinhua) -- China reached the final stage of
the Asian football qualifying tournament for the Sydney Olympics
with maximum points after wrapping up a 2-0 win over the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Englishman Bobby Houghton's charge, who has booked their berth
after closest rivals DPR Korea were tied 1-1 with Vietnam three
days ago, kept their perfect record intact with a pair of second
period goals.
</P>
<P>
Houghton said afterwards that he was very pleased with his team
's "six games, six wins, twenty goals and none conceded"
performance.
</P>
<P>
The DPR Korean goal collapsed in the 62nd minute when Zhang
Xiaorui, coming off the bench at the interval for the wounded mid-
fielder Zhao Junzhe, struck a curling drive just from outside the
box.
</P>
<P>
Li Jinyu, who plays for the French first division side Nancy,
killed the match for the home side with a 89th minute header.
</P>
<P>
The DPR Korea, whose coach declared they had nothing to fear
from China after their narrow 0-1 first leg loss in Vietnam in May,
put up fierce resistance throughout the match and forced out some
awkward moments in either side of the game.
</P>
<P>
An injury time free kick by Myong Song Chol hit the Chinese
defense just going several inches beyond the bar.
</P>
<P>
China also had the woodwork against them, with a 20th minute Li
Weifeng header rebounding off the right post and Sui Dongliang
firing a rocket against the bar.
</P>
<P>
"Even we won this game 2-0, my gut feeling in the second half
was that we were too offensive, we put too many players forward,"
Houghton said.
</P>
<P>
"When you are one goal up for a long period, you don't want
that, because that would let your oppositions just get back into
the game."
</P>
<P>
"It's fair to say that defensively we haven't tested too much
in this tournament. We've got to do more work on defending; that's
for sure," Houghton said. "Our attacking is pretty good."
</P>
<P>
China will meet eight other group winners from across Asia in
the
final stage of the qualifying tournament, the draw for which takes
place on July 4th in the Los Angeles. The top three finishers
from that competition will qualify for Sydney.

<HEADLINE> Vice Finance Minister Rebukes Resettlement Charges (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Poverty relief resettlement in
northwest China's Qinghai province is a voluntary choice of local
residents, according to Vice Minister of Finance Jin Liqun.
</P>
<P>
He noted that some U.S. Congressmen, Tibetan organizations in
exile and members of the western media claim that the World Bank
funded project is designed to "assimilate Tibetans" and "involves
reform-through-labor camps in resettlement areas."
</P>
<P>
Jin said these problems do not exist.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome representatives from foreign governments and
parliaments, foreign envoys in China and members of international
media to visit Qinghai at any time, and the Chinese government
will provide every possible convenience for their visits," said
Jin.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the implementation of the World Bank
project in the Haixi Mongolian and Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture
in Qinghai Province will not change the status of the area.
Instead, resettlement will increase the number of Tibetan
residents in the prefecture.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the autonomous rights of ethnic groups in
the region will always be respected and safeguarded, and noted
that the production style, customs, religious beliefs and ethnic
education institutes will be fully respected and protected.
</P>
<P>
Jin said local people have the option of resettling in the
region on a voluntary basis and can return to their original homes
according to their own will. Their rights are fully protected, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Qinghai will adopt effective measures to improve educational
and healthcare conditions in the resettlement area, said Jin. He
noted that resettlement will be carried out in separate phases
based on experience gained in the experimental phase.

<HEADLINE> UK Housing Market Is Getting Hotter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON June 18 (Xinhua) - Houses in the UK are being snapped up
at the fastest rate eve, with many properties selling in under a
week, according to a new report released Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report, from Bradfor &AMP; Bingley Estate Agents, shows almost
a third of all properties are selling in three weeks or less.
</P>
<P>
The upsurge coincides with rising consumer confidence and
mortgage rates at a 30-year low. "We are now at the peak of the
buying season," said David Woodcock, Director of the agents.
</P>
<P>
"Looking ahead to the second half, I would predict that levels
of activity will decline slightly, as we experience traditional
buying and selling patterns, Woodcock added.
</P>
<P>
The market is hot, but not overheating, according to a separate
report released Thursday by the Royal Institution of Chartered
Surveyors.
</P>
<P>
A survey of its members showed that 62% reported a rise in
house prices in the last three months and 9% reported falls.

<P>
He pointed out that members of various ethnic groups in Qinghai
Province have enjoyed a long history of cordial coexistence. They
share not only religious tolerance and common languages, but also
supplementary farming and animal husbandry activities. Jin said
the resettlement project will not create conflicts of interests
between different ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
He noted that members of various ethnic groups in the region
look forward to implementation of the project at the earliest
possible date.
</P>
<P>
"Various claims have caused serious damage to the interests of
members of ethnic groups and have attempted to deny them of their
right to subsistence and development," said he.
</P>
<P>
"This reflects the unwillingness of some anti-China forces in
the west to accept the development of China and fully confirms
that Tibetan splitist organizations in exile are unwilling to see
improvements in the living standards of the Tibetan people."
</P>
<P>
Jin expressed the hope that the World Bank will disregard
attempts to politicize the matter and instead approve the project
as scheduled on June 22.
</P>
<P>
He said that the anti-China forces in the west act with "
ulterior motives" and adopt dual standards for the World Bank's
approval of projects in an attempt to sabotage stability and
development of China and split the country.
</P>
<P>
"This is absolutely unacceptable," stressed Jin.
</P>
<P>
He said China will not only struggle against anti-China forces
to ensure the implementation of the World Bank-funded project, but
also safeguard the development of all ethnic groups in the country,
including Tibetans. He also noted that China will safeguard the
principles of the World Bank as a multilateral development
organization.
</P>
<P>
The Qinghai poverty relief project is part of a national
program underway in western China. The World Bank will provide a
loan of 40 million US dollars for the project which will be
carried out at a total cost of 740 million yuan (89 million U.S.
dollars).

<HEADLINE> Greece Calls for Long-term Strategy for Balkans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Greece on Friday called for a
long-term strategy that would tackle the practical problems in the
Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with the semi-official Athens News
Agency (ANA), Greece's Alternate Foreign Minister Yiannos
Kranidiotis said that the war in Yugoslavia might have ended, but
the crisis in the wider region of the Western Balkans had not.
</P>
<P>
Greece believed that the crisis could not be tackled through
patchwork, but rather a long-term strategy was necessary which
would give answers to the practical problems, he said, adding that
such a strategy included a generous economic program of
restructuring, a bold program for the institutions and the
operation of democracy, and chiefly the prospect of incorporating
those countries in the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
The minister said that Greece, together with other EU countries,
had launched an initiative to upgrade association links between
the EU and the Balkan countries.
</P>
<P>
As for the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), he said that the
multinational peacekeeping force in Kosovo must guarantee the
disarmament of the KLA, whose uncontrolled activities threatened
to destabilize the wider region.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Kosovo refugees must return to their homes as
soon as possible because if they did not return, they risked
wandering around the region as economic immigrants, which would
create a severe problem.
</P>
<P>
Greece hoped that Kosovo should be a multi-cultural and
multi-racial place with a regime that was tolerant of all the
peoples and populations, he noted.

NICOSIA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides will summon U.S. Ambassador to Cyprus Kenneth Brill
Monday to protest against his refusal to meet Parliament Speaker
Spyros Kyprianou earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with Clerides Friday, Kyprianou said that he
was "satisfied" with the way Clerides handled the situation, the
Cyprus News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Brill refused to meet Kyprianou earlier this months when he
acted as acting president as Clerides was on a state visit to
China.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. also issued a statement last week, saying that members
of left-wing AKEL and center-right Democratic Party (DIKO), which
Kyprianou leads, failed to respond to invitations for
embassy-sponsored events recently, but went where to demonstrate
against North Atlantic Treaty Organization's air raids on
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"The government cannot allow interference in the democratic
political life of a country and to allow a foreign country to
define what the political leadership should do," Kyprianou said.
</P>
<P>
The AKEL said the diplomatic missions in Cyprus should respect
political parties and leaders.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the ruling Democratic Rally Party Nicos Anastasiades
has also said that he "strongly denounces" the U.S. stance toward
AKEL and DIKO.

<P>
KATHMANDU, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Nepalese government has
worked out a policy relating to road construction by the private
sector under the build, operate and turnover (BOT) system, the
official RSS news agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The policy also envisages the involvement of foreign investors,
RSS said, quoting the Ministry of Works and Transport.
</P>
<P>
The BOT system is being introduced for the first time in the
road sector in Nepal under the policy which aims to reduce the
burden on the government in the construction and maintenance of
roads.
</P>
<P>
"Clear-cut arrangements have been made for investors to
determine and raise a service charge for roads constructed and
operated by them through their own investment," RSS quoted a
ministry press release as saying.
</P>
<P>
Under the policy, the operating period will be determined on
the basis of projected earnings and expenditures and can be up to
50 years, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
It said the policy formulated with focus on the environmental
aspect also provides encouragement to investors with concessions
in income tax and other tax liabilities as well as assurances of
investment security.
</P>
<P>
The Nepalese government will provide foreign exchange at
prevailing market rates for the payment of principal and interest
on loans and investment repatriation, RSS said.
</P>
<P>
The policy requires investors to make use of local resources,
means and manpower as far as possible, RSS said.
</P>
<P>
It is recognized in Nepal that development and expansion of the
transport facilities is the basic prerequisite for the development
of the kingdom which is mountainous and village-dominated, while
road transport stands as the most important sub-sector.

<HEADLINE> Clinton and Schroeder: No Russian Zone in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOGNE, June 18 (Xinhua)--The U.S. President Bill Clinton and
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder Friday declared there would
not be any special Russian zone in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We won't have two security presences, but only one," said
Schroeder's security advisor, Michael Steiner, after the talks
between the German Chancellor and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
According to Steiner, the two leaders agreed that "a model
without the division of Kosovo" should be accepted.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the two leaders stressed Russia remained the
west's partner and their relationship was good, said Steiner.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of Germany and the United States were ready to
"negotiate with the Russian side and acknowledge its wish
on...European security issues", said Steiner.
</P>
<P>
Sandy Berger, Clinton's security adviser, said at an earlier
press conference that Russia and the United States were nearly
achieving a compromise at their meeting in Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
The two are taking part in the Group of Seven (G-7) summit in
Cologne, where other heads of the world's leading industrial
nations also arrived. They are British Prime Minister Tony Blair,
French President Jaques Chirac, Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema,
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, and Japanese Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
The three-day summit was expected to focus on world financial
issues, but it is overshadowed by the West-Russia wrangle in
Kosovo.

COLOGNE, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Unite States's national
security adviser for White House, Sandy Berger, said here Friday
that Russia and the United States are close to a deal over the
status of Russian forces as part of Kosovo international security
presence.
</P>
<P>
"We are into a period of closure here...they are discussing
some final issues," Berger told a group of journalists who are
covering the Group of Eight (G-8) summit meeting in Cologne,
Germany.
</P>
<P>
Berger also said it was hopeful the talks in Helsinki between
Russian and US foreign ministers, Igor Ivanov and Madeleine
Albright and defence ministers Igor Sergeyev and William Cohen,
would yield an agreement as the G-8 summit started its first
session.
</P>
<P>
He also told reporters that Russian troops in Kosovo are
expected to play a role as same as they are doing in Bosnia. The
United States "want the Russians to do the job as they did in
Bosnia," Berger said.
</P>
<P>
While describing US-Russia ties as "sound", Berger gave no
details about the deal but said the agreement would preserve the
unity of Kosovo international forces (KFOR) command. Albright and
Cohen would fly to Brussels to brief NATO heads if the deal were
reached, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, German government security adviser Michael Steiner
told reporters that Russians could not be allowed to own an
exclusively controlled zone. "We will not have two security
presences, but only one," he said when he was conveying some
details discussed between US President Bill Clinton and German

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects Deal over Arrested Jews </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 18 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iranian official said here
Friday that Iran will not make any deals with any country over the
13 Iranian Jews arrested on espionage charges.
</P>
<P>
"Those who think that it is possible to strike a deal on the
fate of the spies are definitely mistaken," Secretary of the
Constitutional Guardian Council Ayatollah Ahi Jannati said to the
Friday prayer congregation on the campus of Tehran University.
</P>
<P>
The files of those arrested are under close investigations by
the court and "the punishment for espionage is death," he was
quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Jannati said that the investigation is being conducted
regardless of religious beliefs of the betrayers, be they Muslims
or otherwise.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the relatives of the arrested Iranian Jews charged
with spying are living in the occupied Palestinian territory
(Israel), these traitors were engaged in surreptitious operation
of transmitting information to Israel through Turkey," he said.
</P>
<P>
He blasted Israel, the U.S. and Britain for their criticism
that the rights of the religious minorities in Iran are being
trampled upon.
</P>
<P>
It should be noted that those facing spying charges in Iran
will be given a fair trial and served proper punishment like many
other traitors in the nation, the Iranian official said.
</P>
<P>
Israel and some western countries have expressed concern over
human rights violation in Iran after Tehran confirmed the arrest
of 13 Iranian Jews charged with spying for Israel and the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Both Israel and the U.S. denied that the Iranian Jews had
worked for their intelligence services and urged Iranian
authorities to release them.

SAN JOSE, United States, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Sweden and China
will play for the first time on neutral ground at women's World Cup
and Swedish coach promised to give China a tough match in the group
d opener at San Jose on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Marika Domanski-Lyfors, head coach of the Swedish team,
said:"This is a tough group, and a point would be a very good start.
I think we can take that point."
</P>
<P>
Sweden will also play Australia and Ghana in the first round of
the Third Women's World Cup which kicks off Saturday in seven
American cities.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal here is to reach the quarterfinals and reach the
Olympics," said Domanski-Lyfors.
</P>
<P>
Swedish captain and midfielder Malin Andersson also offered
measured optimism:"China is a very good team and I'm nervous because
this is a very big game for us. But I think we can do it."
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old Andersson, leading scorer of the Swedish team
who had scored more than 20 goals in international matches,
said:"We're young and hungary."
</P>
<P>
Domanski-Lyfors said they know China well:"We're playing a quite
physical and strong team, which goes straight for the goal and is
quite organized on defense. We're just have to slow some Chinese
players down."
</P>
<P>
"We know China, we know how well they play. But the most
important thing is how well we play." said Domanski-Lyfors.
</P>
<P>
Both China and Sweden had played in the previous two World Cup
tournaments with the Swedish team stopping China in the
quarterfinals in the inaugural World Cup in China while China edging
Sweden through penalty shoot-out also in the quarterfinals in the
second World Cup in 1995.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. special envoy Charles
Kartman will meet Vice Foreign Minister Kim Gye Gwan of the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) in Beijing on
Wednesday, the U.S. State Department said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kartman and Kim will talk about the results of last month's
U.S. visit to a DPRK underground site, four-party talks on
Korea in Geneva in August and issues related to the U.S.-DPRK
agreement on nuclear framework, a State Department official
said.
</P>
<P>
A team of U.S. experts went to the underground site at
Kumchang-ri in May, where Washington had alleged there was a
suspicious place for the revival of DPRK's nuclear weapons
program. But they found only an empty tunnel and nothing else.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming four-party talks in Geneva, which also include
China and South Korea, are the sixth round of talks since they
began in 1997. The four-party talks are aimed to find a
long-term settlement of the conflict on the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
the Beijing meeting was planned before this week's clashes
between the DPRK and the Republic of Korea in the Yellow sea.

LAGOS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's President Olusegun
Obasanjo Friday met with senators of the country's two minority
parties in a bid to accelerate the clearance of his 49 ministerial
nominees being held up in the senate.
</P>
<P>
The meeting with the 43 senators of the All People's Party and
Alliance for Democracy came a day after a similar meeting with
senators of his own People's Democratic Party, to rally support
for the nominees.
</P>
<P>
The senate asked president Obasanjo Thursday for additional
information on the nominees, two weeks after their names were
submitted to the upper chamber for clearance.
</P>
<P>
Critics of the nominees, which included 11 women, had accused
the president of "recycling" for public office holders, an
allegation denied by Vice President Alhaji Atiku Abubakar
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"There are just six former office holders." he said in defense,
only five of the nominees, three on Thursday and the two others
on Friday, have been cleared by the 109-member senator which has
constitutional responsibility for clearing ministerial nominees.
</P>
<P>
The senator is expected to continue deliberations on the list
Tuesday.  Also on Friday, Nigeria's House of Representatives
adopted the report of its rules committee which provides for a 24
hour working week, 16 hours less than the 40 hours for the
600,000 strong public sector workers.
</P>
<P>
The 20-member committee recommended six hours of sitting
between Monday and Thursday while Friday was reserved as "members
consultation day" to enable members to consult on various issues
before the lower chamber.
</P>
<P>
Members of the 360-member lower chamber would sit from 10 a.m.,
going on break at 1:00 p.p. before resuming at 3:30 p.m. to close
for the day at 6: 00 p.m.

<HEADLINE> 980 Tanzanians Seized in Overseas Drug Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 18 (Xinhua) -- A total of 980 Tanzanian
nationals were arrested abroad between January 1986 and 1998 in
connection with drug offenses, an anti-drug official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary of Tanzania's Anti-drug Commission George
Timbuka said in the capital Dar es Salaam that there were 792
cases related to drug trafficking abroad by Tanzanian nationals
during this period.
</P>
<P>
The drugs include marijuana, heroin, cocaine, morphine, opium,
hashish, cannabis, mandrax, amphetamine and others, he said.
</P>
<P>
Timbuka said during the period, 1,515 suspects were arrested
within the country for possession of drugs, while 1,020 cases were
reported.
</P>
<P>
He said the cases have been on the rise, noting that during the
past five years up to 190 cases per year were reported compared
with merely five in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Bhang smoking and trading are also increasing, he said, citing
3,445 kilograms impounded last year and 5,384 suspects arrested,
compared with 1, 827 kilograms and 972 suspects in 1986.
</P>
<P>
In another development, he said Tanzanian Prime Minister
Frederick Sumaye is expected to launch the United Nations
International Drug Control Program (UNDCP) country program in Dar
es Salaam on June 26, the World Anti- drug Day.
</P>
<P>
The theme of this year's Tanzanian anti-drug campaign is "Music
Against Drugs", which is aimed at encouraging drug takers,
especially youths, to turn on music and turn off drugs as part of
entertainment.

LONDON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Violence flared up in the
City of London Friday as police and protesters clashed
during a "Carnival against Capitalism" to mark the opening
of the G8 world economic summit in Cologne.
</P>
<P>
Up to 4000 demonstrators converged on the City to
target financial institutions they regard as "morally and
politically-incorrect companies".
</P>
<P>
A City of London police spokesman said the protesters
had split into four groups and a number of officers were
believed to have been injured in clashes.
</P>
<P>
"Missiles are being thrown at police and police
vehicles have been damaged. Officers are keeping the
crowds under surveillance," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"They are throwing stuff from building sites - bricks,
concrete blocks and other debris," he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier around 300 cyclists had disrupted traffic in
London's financial heartland.
</P>

Carrying banners with slogans like "Money Kills", they
rode slowly into the city center and brought traffic

<HEADLINE> Ghana Surprised at Reported Threat on U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Ghana said Friday it has learnt
with surprise and dismay that a terrorist group has targeted U.S.
facilities in Ghana for its activities.
</P>
<P>
A statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Accra said
the story by U.S. Television Company CNN, which is attributed to
the U.S. State Department, came as a surprise to Ghana, the
Ghanaian News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
 "Indeed, the Government of Ghana has cooperated with all
countries, including the U.S., in sharing information and
adopting measures aimed at combating threats posed by terrorism."
</P>
<P>
The ministry said it is therefore unfortunate for the U.S.
State department to make such announcement that has the effect of
undermining the image of peace and stability as well as the
goodwill that Ghana enjoys in the international community.
</P>
<P>
 The ministry noted that in August last year, a similar
situation developed when the U.S. Embassy in Accra closed down on
account of perceived terrorist threats without consultation or
prior information to the Ghana government.
</P>
<P>
"The pattern is not only disturbing but also unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
"At a time when Ghana is making serious efforts to boost
investor confidence in its economy and political arrangements,
such wrong impressions as the U. S. State Department statement
has sought to create is grossly unfair and goes against the grain
of the cooperative ties between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
 The ministry said it is particularly revealing that the
broadcast should be made on the heels of the just-ended
African-African American Summit which was highly successful and
have served to reinforce Ghana as a safe haven for investment.
</P>
<P>
 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that it would like to
reassure the general public that Ghana will continue at all
times to cooperate fully and promptly with all her partners in
dealing decisively with alleged or perceived threat."

At its best, the index came within five points of its closing

<HEADLINE> IFC Invests in Food Company in Ecuador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) announced on Friday that it will invest 13.2
million U.S. dollars in La Universal, S.A., one of Ecuador's
leading confectionery and food companies.
</P>
<P>
The project is the IFC's first investment in an industrial
manufacturing company in Ecuador since the 1970s and reflects its
strategy of expanding its presence in the Andean Region and
helping companies with good growth potential to modernize their
operations and increase competitiveness, the IFC said.
</P>
<P>
IFC's investment provides La Universal with new equity and
long-term financing that will strengthen the company's capital and
financial structure.
</P>
<P>
La Universal, with total sales of 37 million dollars in 1998,
produces chocolate, candy, pasta, consumer cocoa, and
semi-finished cocoa products.
</P>
<P>
The project, expected to be completed by March 2000, will
upgrade La Universal's plant, remove production bottlenecks,
increase capacity, and restructure existing short-term debt.
</P>
<P>
IFC's financing consists of a loan for its own account of up to
8.2 million dollars, and an equity investment of up to 5 million
dollars.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Mortgage Delinquencies Fall to 4-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The number of Americans who are
in arrears with their mortgage payments declined to the lowest
level in four years during the first three months of 1999,
according to the Mortgage Bankers Association of America.
</P>
<P>
Mortgage delinquencies fell to a seasonally adjusted 4.13
percent in the January-March quarter, down from 4.26 percent
during the fourth quarter of 1998, the association said Friday.
</P>
<P>
That's the lowest delinquency rate since the first quarter of
1995. The rate was 4.42 percent during the January-March period
last year.
</P>
<P>
Plentiful jobs and low interest rates have been helping
consumers keep up with payments on new and refinanced loans.
</P>
<P>
However, the percentage of loans in foreclosure at the end of
the first quarter of this year increased slightly to 1.16 percent
from 1.11 percent at the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
A streak of unusually low mortgage rates -- below 7 percent --
that began last summer persisted into the early months of this
year, helping to fuel a record home-buying boom and encouraging
those already owning homes to refinance their mortgages at lower
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
However, mortgage rates have begun to edge up since last month
because of financial market concerns about hints from Federal
Reserve officials of a possible interest rate hike later this
summer that would be intended to help cool the economy to prevent
inflation.
</P>
<P>
This week, the average rate on 30-year mortgages hit two-year
high of 7.65 percent, according to Freddie Mac, the mortgage
company.

<HEADLINE> Qatari Emir Leaves UAE for Riyadh to Mediate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin
Khalifa al-Thani left here Saturday for Riyadh to continue his
mediation efforts to defuse a row between the United Arab Emirates
(UAE) and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure, Sheikh Hamad held talks with UAE
President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan on the latest
developments in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries and
ways of strengthening unity among them, UAE Minister of State for
Foreign Affairs Sheikh Hamdan Bin Zayed al-Nahyan told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The GCC is a regional alliance which groups Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain and the UAE.
</P>
<P>
The solidarity of the group has been put to the test recently
because of a quarrel between the UAE and Saudi Arabia over the
latter's rapprochement with Iran.
</P>
<P>
The UAE accused Saudi Arabia of putting personal interests
above collective responsibilities and obligations by warming up
relations with Iran, with whom the UAE has a dispute over the Gulf
islands of Abu Musa and Greater and Lesser Tunbs.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia dismissed the accusation as childish, maintaining
that rapprochement with Iran was good for the stability of the
whole region.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has repeatedly called for dialog with Iran or
resorting to international arbitration over the islands, which
have been occupied by Iran since Britain retreated from the Gulf
in 1971.
</P>
<P>
But Iran says the islands are part of its territory and there
is no ambiguity about their legal status.

LONDON June 19 (Xinhua) - Six men were charged in court with
public order offenses following Friday's anti-capitalist
demonstration in the City of London which led to clashes with the
police.
</P>
<P>
Magistrates bailed four of the men and remanded in custody the
other two. All will have to reappear before a court at a later
date.
</P>
<P>
Police believe the protests, which left a trail of damage
across the City of London, were planned, and said some
demonstrators were from groups with a track record of "extreme
violence."
</P>
<P>
Chief Inspector Ed Bateman of the Metropolitan Police said his
officer had been through "something horrific."

"I certainly haven't seen gas used before. I think it was
possibly mustard gas, or some form of gas, that got into my
officers' eyes and they couldn't work," he said.

demonstration Friday, organized by the June 18 (J18) umbrella

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 19 (Xinhua) -- An official of the International
Committee of Red Cross (ICRC) Saturday said the organization has
scaled down its staff in Afghanistan after some of its members
were beaten by Taliban soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The anonymous official was quoted by the News Network
International of Pakistan as saying six armed and masked Taliban
soldiers captured 10 ICRC staff members, including two foreigners,
outside Kabul and beat them.
</P>
<P>
An Australian and a Swiss national, along with eight ICRC local
employees, were going to the central Afghan town of Bamiyan from
Kabul with the permission of the Taliban authorities when they
were detained.
</P>
<P>
After the incident, the ICRC has decided to reduce its staff
and has left only those who are directly required in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC staff in the war-wrecked country will only work on a
life saving program, said the official.
</P>
<P>
He asked the Taliban leadership to provide security to the ICRC
staff before they resume a full-scale program.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOGNE, Germany, June 19 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder and Russian Prime Minister Sergei Stepanshin focused
their Saturday talks on Russia's debt issues, officials said on
the eve of the Groups of Eight (G-8) summit in Cologne, Germany.
</P>
<P>
German officials have warned there would not be any major debt
remission package for Russia to emerge from the summit, an
indication accepted by Russian Prime Minister Sergei Stepanshin.
</P>
<P>
"The debts must be paid and we will do it," Stepanshin told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Currently Russia owed 150 billion dollars of foreign debt, 17.5
billion of which was supposed to be paid back this year.
</P>
<P>
Part of Russia's foreign debt was succeeded from the former
Soviet Union, which had owed 40 billion marks (21 billion dollars)
to Germany.
</P>
<P>
Stepanshin is representing his president Boris Yeltsin to take
part in the Group of Eight (G-8) summit. Yeltsin is due to attend

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh, India Open Cross-Border Bus Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi and Indian prime
ministers inaugurated the cross-border bus service between their
two countries on Saturday by jointly greeting here two buses from
Calcutta, capital of West Bengal state of India.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, Bangladeshi Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina said, "The inaugural run of the direct bus
service... heralds a new chapter in the relations" between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The bus service was a "long-cherished" desire of the common
people of India and Bangladesh, she said. "The easily available
communication facilities will strengthen and extend the existing
cordial relations between the peoples of the two countries," she
added.
</P>
<P>
The opening of direct bus service between Dhaka and Calcutta
was "an enjoyable occasion" for the Bangladeshi and Indian people,
said Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, who arrived here
Saturday morning for a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
In the past, people who wanted to travel to the other side of
the border had to walk across the border carrying their luggage
and now the inauguration of the bus service would strengthen the
exchange of trade, culture and ideas between the two countries, he
said.
</P>
<P>
West Bengal and Bangladesh had many things in common, such as
language and culture, he said, adding that the two countries could
solve any "complicated problems by bilateral dialogue."
</P>
<P>
A two-year agreement on the bus service was signed here on
Thursday between the two South Asian neighboring countries, and
Communication Ministry officials said the commercial operation of
the bus service would formally start before June 29 this year.
</P>
<P>
In February this year, the two countries initialed the
agreement in the Indian capital, New Delhi, and a protocol for the
final agreement was signed here in early April after two trial bus
runs between Dhaka and Calcutta.

CAIRO, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and Yemen on Saturday called
for a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East,
based on relevant U.N. resolutions and the land-for-peace
principle.
</P>
<P>
A future settlement for the Arab-Israeli conflict "should
guarantee full Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Palestinian
and Arab lands," said a joint communique issued at the close of
the four-day fifth session of the Egyptian-Yemeni Higher
Committee.
</P>
<P>
It should "secure the legitimate rights of the Palestinian
people, including the right to self-determination and establishing
an independent state with Jerusalem as its capital," the
communique said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Yemen demanded that Israel comply with the
international resolutions and the signed agreements. They also
urged the world community to intensify efforts to revive the peace
process stalled since 1996 due to the intransigence of hardline
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>

The two sides examined the latest developments in the Arab
world, stressing the importance of promoting the mechanisms of the
Arab League as the body representing the ideal framework for Arab
joint action.
</P>

Egypt and Yemen played up the need to pursue efforts to restore
inter-Arab solidarity and upgrade joint cooperation.
</P>

<HEADLINE> World Bank Sets New Conditions for Aid to Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has set new
conditions for its financial assistance to Angola, local media
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
World Bank executive officer for Angola, Zimbabwe and Malawi,
Barbara Kafka told the press at the airport before leaving Luanda
Friday that she had urged the Angolan government to take more
measures in economic reforms in exchange for more assistance.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank official pointed out that efforts should be made
in such fields as financial readjustment, budget deficit
reduction, more investment in health care and education
development, as well as cutting cutting red tape which have
obstructed the development of the Angolan economy.
</P>
<P>
She noted that if the Angolan government satisfies these
requirements, the World Bank will go on providing assistance for
the eight projects already underway and will consider more
assistance for the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
The eight projects involving education, power and energy and
urban sanitation, value at some 150 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Kafka noted that the World Bank will at its annual meeting in
late September this year assess the measures taken by the Angolan
government and decide its future policy toward the southern
African country.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, due to the resumption of civil war and the worsening
macroeconomic situation, the World Bank was considering closing
its office in Luanda.
</P>
<P>
Angolan Finance Minister Joaquim Duarte da Costa persuaded the
world financial institution to suspend the move and resume talks
on aid with the Angolan government during his trip to Washington
in early May.

<HEADLINE> South Criticizes G-7's Debt Relief Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cologne, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Cologne Debt Initiative of the
Group of Seven (G-7) industrial nations will not bring any relief
to the people in the South who suffer from debt domination, a
group of campaigns and social movements said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the G-7 rich countries agreed during their summit
in Frankfurt to cut the debt of world's poorest nations and rubber-
stamped a deal concluded last weekend by their finance ministers.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, about 70 billion U.S. dollars owed by 36
poorest countries in Africa and Latin America are expected to be
written off.
</P>
<P>
But Jubilee South, a coalition of debt campaigns and social
movements from Africa, Asia and Latin America, said in a statement
that the initiative "is not a faster, deeper or broader debt
relief as the G-7 claims."
</P>
<P>
"In fact, it is not a relief at all but rather a self-serving
formula to keep governments in the South from defaulting. Judged
by its own terms, the Cologne Initiative still deals with less
than 2 percent of the total nominal debt stock of the South," the
group representing the South said.
</P>
<P>
"It still remains confined to a small group of countries,
ignoring the plight of the poor in all other countries in the
South. The plan is also inconsistent with the OECD (Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development) commitment to halve the
levels of absolute poverty by the year 2015," the civilian social
group added.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton said the debt relief agreement "is
an historic step to help the world's poorest nations achieve
sustained growth and independence while targeting new resources
for poverty reduction, education and combating AIDS."
</P>
<P>
However, Jubilee South sees nothing to welcome in this
initiative. "This Cologne scheme, like its predecessors, refuses
to acknowledge the moral dimensions of the debt crisis and the
historical responsibility of the rich countries for the current
state of affairs," it said.
</P>
<P>
"For moral reasons, the debt of the South is illegitimate.
Furthermore, it has been paid over and over again," Jubilee South
said while demanding a total, unconditional cancellation of all
the debt of the South.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Dismisses British Allegation of Slave Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar dismissed Saturday an
accusation made by a British delegate to the International Labor
Organization that it still employs slave labor at the end of the
20th century.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the accusation of Bill Brett at the current 87th
session of the International Labor Conference (ILC) in Geneva, the
Myanmar government said in a statement issued here Saturday, "The
so-called forced labor practice, which he has been accusing the
Myanmar government of exercising, is merely the laws that the
British government had enacted during 1907 when they governed
Myanmar."
</P>
<P>
Despite continuous exercise of this law and practice by all
successive Myanmar governments since regaining independence from
the British, the present Myanmar government has ordered a stop to
the exercise of power under certain provisions of the British
Towns Act and Village Act of 1907, the government said in its
Information Sheet .
</P>
<P>
On May 14 this year, the Myanmar government issued an order
directing the relevant authorities not to exercise the powers
under the provisions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Myanmar Foreign Ministry said in a press release
Thursday that this order has brought those two laws in line with
the Forced Labor Convention.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also announced on that day dissociation of Myanmar
itself from the current resolution adopted at the ILC which
accused the country of widespread use of forced labor and
restriction of freedom of association.

KHARTOUM, JUNE 19 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir
and Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi held talks Friday evening on
bilateral ties as well as regional, African and international
issues, a Sudan News Agency (SUNA) report said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But well informed sources were quoted as saying Gaddafi carried
proposals for narrowing the gap between the Sudanese government
and the opposition forces in northern and southern Sudan.
</P>

The sources said Gaddafi had a stop over in Nairobi, Kenya on
his way back from South Africa to meet John Garang, leader of the
rebel South People's Liberation Army (SPLA), the main southern
opposition faction, and discussed his conditions for
reconciliation with the government.

Gaddafi arrived in Khartoum Friday afternoon for a three-day
official visit, the first to an Arab country by the Libyan leader

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's 1999 Constitution Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's eminent lawyer Frederick
Williams has violently criticized the 1999 Constitution as "a
fraudulent document", the Guardian newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a workshop on constitution reform in Lagos Friday,
Williams, chairman of the 1979 Constitution Drafting Committee,
said that it was fraudulent of the Abdulsalam Abubakar
administration to have fostered such a constitution.
</P>
<P>
Williams picked on three areas of the document for criticism:
the judiciary, the legislature and the executive arms of
government.
</P>
<P>
He said that the 1999 constitution made a radical departure
from what obtained in the 1979 constitution by making the
administration of justice to revolve around the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
Williams gave Obasanjo a pass mark for sending the list of his
ministers to the National Assembly on time. But he flayed the
parliamentarians for delaying the approval of the list.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he advised President Obasanjo to act within the
limits of his powers under the constitution so as to avoid a
situation where he would have a clash with the law.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Nigerian Bar Association Ikeja branch, Dele
Adesina, also said at the workshop that the association will issue
a communique to press for the constitution reform.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's 1999 Constitution, which was passed earlier this
year, has been under constant criticism and President Olusegun
Obasanjo had promised to set up a special organization to look
into the document at his first speech at the National Assembly
last month.

<HEADLINE> 100 Random Doping Tests Ordered for Wimbledon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 19 (Xinhua) -- World tennis governing body the
International Tennis Federation (ITF) will carry out 100 random
doping tests during the two weeks of the Wimbledon championships.
</P>
<P>
The figure means more than one in three of the 256 players will
undergo a drug test at Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
"One hundred players will be tested at random throughout
Wimbledon and there's no way a player can escape," the ITF's
executive medical director Debbie Jevans was quoted as saying in
the Mirror newspaper on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"If you look at tennis, it's a sport which, thankfully, has
remained relatively free from drugs and that is something we are
determined to maintain throughout Wimbledon."
</P>
<P>
The crackdown comes a year after disgraced Czech star Petr
Korda became the first player to test positive at Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
Korda was stripped of his 60,000 pounds prize-money and ranking
points after testing positive for anabolic steroids following his
quarter-final exit against Tim Henman. He announced his
retirement this week and will not be at the tournament.
</P>
<P>
Jevans said the ITF carried out 1,000 tests throughout the year
and believed that its testing standards and procedures were among
the best in sports.
</P>
<P>
He added the ITF also intended to monitor closely the use of
the performance-enhancing drug creatine, despite it not being a
banned substance.
</P>
<P>
"We are assessing every player who is using it because the
health of the athlete is first and foremost. At the moment it's
not illegal but we're very aware of concerns and we are passing
those on to the players who are using it," he added.

<P>
CAIRO, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has expressed support for
Slovenia's wish to join mechanisms for cooperation in the
Mediterranean region, local Al-Ahram daily reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Egypt supports Slovenia's efforts to participate in the
Mediterranean Forum and the Barcelona process, Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa said Friday during a meeting with visiting
Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
The Mediterranean Forum and the Barcelona process, or the
Euro-Med Partnership, kicked off in 1995 in Barcelona, Spain, are
aimed at strengthening cooperation in political, economic, social
and security areas among the 15 European Union members and 12
countries on the eastern and southern coast of the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Moussa termed the
talks as important, during which he discussed with Drnovsek the
bilateral ties, the Middle East peace process, the situation in
the Balkans and the Mediterranean region, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian official added that he briefed Drnovsek on the

seeking ways of boosting cooperation.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> IMF, PDI-P Agree to Implement Fixed Rate System if Indonesian Economy Recovers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) have
agreed that a fixed exchange rate system will be implemented after
the Indonesian economy recovers.
</P>
<P>
"I agree with the IMF that a fixed rate will not be implemented
at this time on the grounds that the rupiah is tending toward
further gain," head of the PDI-P think-tank Kwik Kian Gie said
here Saturday after a meeting with IMF First Deputy Managing
Director Stanley Fischer and IMF Director for Asia Pacific region
Hubert Neiss.
</P>
<P>
Following his party's lead in the vote count of the June 7
general election, Kwik has suggested the idea on a fixed exchange
rate system to solve the country's monetary problem.
</P>
<P>
Kwik acknowledged that the IMF did not show specific support
for PDI-P, but he said the IMF has stated that it will support the
next government so long as the new government is ready to team up
with the IMF.
</P>
<P>
"If PDI-P governs this country, our party will set ties with
the IMF and there will not be any fundamental change to the PDI-P
and IMF agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Neiss said the meeting with PDI-P touched on
currency policy.
</P>
<P>
"However the IMF sees that for this time the government should
continue maintaining a floating exchange rate system," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fischer, who arrived here Friday for a two-day visit, said
Friday night after meeting with President B.J. Habibie that the
IMF hoped the flexible exchange rate system will be retained
because it has been working very well.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia introduced the flexible rate system in August 1997
after the region's monetary crisis.
</P>
<P>
Fischer also said the IMF expects to be able to work with a new
government.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary results of the general election held on June 7
showed PDI-P is in lead and it may establish a coalition
government at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The IMF has arranged a 46 billion U.S. dollars bailout for the
Indonesian economy, which was brought to its knees by the Asian
financial crisis in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Fischer is expected to meet with other major political parties
to discuss the economic situation in Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> Tea Export Volume Increases in Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Coffee and Tea Authority
of Ethiopia said that it has obtained over 710,000 U.S. dollars
from the export of 323.3 tons of tea during the past nine months,
135 tons more than that of the same period of last Ethiopian year
which starts on September 11.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian Herald newspaper Saturday, General
Manager of the authority, Tsegaye Berhane said that the Horn of
Africa country began exporting tea in 1994 and 500,000 dollars was
obtained annually with exporting about 400 tons of tea in the past
five years.
</P>
<P>
Tsegaye attributed the increase of tea export volume to the
stepped up production activities made in the past few years in the
Wush-Wush and Gumero state farm development projects.
</P>
<P>
Presently, 3,400 tons of tea is produced on average from the
two state farms annually, the general manager said, adding that
local tea production has increased so much that it has now been
possible to meet the society's consumption needs entirely.
</P>
<P>
This year the authority obtained a sum of over 1.32 million
dollars by supplying the local market with 664.6 tons of tea, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Canada, Britain, Pakistan, Yemen and
Djibouti are major markets of the Ethiopia-produced tea, according
to the general manager.

<HEADLINE> IMF Hopes Indonesia to Retain Flexible System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has expressed the hope that the future Indonesian government
will retain the current flexible exchange rate system as the
system has shown encouraging results.
</P>
<P>
"The flexible rate has been working well, and thus the IMF
hopes that the system will be retained," Stanley Fischer, IMF
first deputy managing director, said here Friday night after his
three-hour meeting with President B.J. Habibie.
</P>
<P>
The topic of a flexible exchange rate system was raised by the
press to Fischer since economists of the Indonesian Democratic
Party of Struggle (PDI-P) have disclosed the possibility of
applying such a system if they rule the country, official Antara
News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Fischer, who arrived here Friday for a two-day visit, also said
that he will raise the issue of Indonesia's current flexible
exchange rate system in meeting with PDI-P research and
development chairman Kwik Kian Gie, who has suggested the rate
should be fixed.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia adopted the flexible rate system in August 1997 after
the region's monetary crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The preconditions for having a fixed exchange rate are very
demanding, but we will have to discuss with Mr. Kwik and with
others how they see the situation and what exchange rate system
would be best for Indonesia," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said the sharp rise in the Jakarta stock market may
indicate a return of confidence in the economy, though in dollar
term the market remained "way below" its value before the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the economy is bottoming out, he said, "It is
what the data say, there is growth in the first quarter ...
inflation is essentially moving down (to) zero."
</P>
<P>
Fischer also said the IMF expected to be able to work with a
new government.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary results of the general election held on June 7
showed PDI-P will be in lead and it may establish a coalition
government at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
"We will work together with the new government, and if it wants
to continue with policies that we can support, we will support
them. And I expect we will," Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF has arranged a 46 billion U.S. dollars bailout for the
Indonesian economy, which was brought to its knees by the Asian
financial crisis in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said he expected a smooth political transition in
Indonesia after this month's elections, and declared it was time
for investors to return.

<HEADLINE> DPRK to Attend Beijing Talks As Scheduled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK)  informed South Korea Saturday morning that it will
send a delegation to Beijing, China, for the inter-Korean vice
ministerial-level talks scheduled for next Monday, said South
Korean Ministry for Unification.
</P>
<P>
Pyongyang conveyed the message to Seoul by a hotline between
the liaison offices of inter-Korean Red Cross organizations at the
truce village of Panmunjon, said Shin Un-sang, a spokesman for the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
The message was given under the directive of Jon Kum-chol, who
is the vice president of the DPRK's Committee of the Peaceful
Reunification of the Fatherland.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman said the DPRK did not give a list of
delegation to the forthcoming talks in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, Seoul informed Pyongyang of a list of its
delegation for Beijing talks. The delegation will be headed by
South Korea's Vice Unification Minister, Yang Young-shik.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming talks will discuss issues on reunion of separated
family members and Seoul's fertilizer assistance to Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
A South Korean ship loaded with 5,000 tons of fertilizers left
port of Ulsan for the DPRK early Saturday, said the South Korean
Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, in an exchange of fire between the two sides in
the Yellow Sea, one DPRK torpedo boat was sunken and three others
seriously damaged while two South Korean patrol ships were
slightly damaged and seven servicemen wounded.
</P>
<P>
The past days have seen no special signs of mounting tension in
the Yellow Sea after the military clash.

<HEADLINE> Turin Named Host City for 2006 Winter Olympic Games (updated with quotes) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic Committee
(IOC) Saturday afternoon selected Turin, Italy, as the venue for
the 2006 Winter Olympic Games with a vote of 53 against 36.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-nine IOC members attending the eight-day meeting of the
IOC 109th session cast secret ballots at Seoul Shilla Hotel. 53
IOC members voted for Turin while 36 others for Sion, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Turin collected votes of IOC members from Asian,
African and Latin and Central American countries while Sion won
support of European and North American nations. Sion failed in its
third bid to host the Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
"Sion made some mistakes. But firstly, we are the best. Today
demonstrated the result of our efforts of years " Giuseppe Alberto
Zunino, member of Turin's bid committee, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
However, Zunino refused to went into details what mistakes Sion
had made.
</P>
<P>
It is said that an IOC member from Switzerland produced
aversion at the IOC 109th session due to his over-statement over
the issue in relation to the scandal of the Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
It will be the second time in 50 years for Italy to host the
Winter Olympic Games. Italy hosted the 1956 Winter Games in
Cortina D'Ampezzo and 1960 Summer Games in Rome in 1960.
</P>
<P>
Turin is an industrial and cultural center in northwest Italy
with a population of 2.2 million. It is Italy's third largest city
and mountain resorts.
</P>
<P>
The 15-strong IOC Selection Committee unanimously chose Turin
and Sion as finalists out of six cities vying for the Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
The four other unsuccessful candidates were Helsinki of Finland,
Klangenfurt of Australia, Poprad-Tatry of Slovakia and Zakopane of
Poland.
</P>
<P>
The selection method, in which the "selection college" elected
the two finalists, was introduced for the first time in the
history and in the wake of the Sea Lake City vote-buying scandal.
</P>
<P>
The IOC adopted the new process at its previous session in
Lausanne, Switzerland.

FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said:"If women are playing, women

</P>
<P>
Canadian Sonia Denoncourt will referee the opening match between

But FIFA found it difficult to get experienced female referees.
"A lot of these girls are unknown quantities," said Cooper, "We'll

FIFA has conducted a test for the referees and emphasized "the
human touch" more than soccer rules. "We concentrated on building
the confidence of referees who have never had the experience of
refereeing in front of huge crowd." said Cooper.

<HEADLINE> Macao Govt Sees Big Fiscal Surplus Up to May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The surplus came mainly as a result of the unexpected
collection of land-using fees, less investment in public projects,
the suspension of pay rise for civil servants and saving measures
in government departments.
</P>
<P>
The media quoted government sources as saying that a total of
360 million patacas (45 million U.S. dollars) of land-using fees
was collected from real estate investors, which had been
unexpected because of poor economic performance.
</P>
<P>
The budgetary investment for the entire year is 1.2 billion
patacas (0.15 billion dollars), but the actual investment between
January and May was about 150 million patacas (18.75 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, government investment will rise considerably beginning
from September as the rule of Macao by Portugal will be handed
over to China on December 20 this year. Expenditures related to
the handover will only be about 300 million patacas (37.5 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Macao government does not have a fiscal reserve system and
its foreign exchange reserve is limited. More fiscal savings will
be conducive to the smooth operation of the government of the
Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) to be set up on December
20.
</P>
<P>
The largest portion of revenue for the SAR government comes
from land-using fees kept by the Chinese side of the Sino-
Portuguese Land Group. The sum is over 9 billion patacas (1.125
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
China and Portugal have agreed that the income from land-using
fees is halved by the Portuguese Macao government and the future
Macao SAR government from the signing of the Sino-Portuguese Joint
Declaration in 1987 up to the handover.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Asian Economies Need Structural Reforms for Sustained Recovery (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Asian economies need to continue
their structural reforms in an efforts to promote conditions which
will not only foster a full and speedy recovery, but also ensure
that the recovery is balanced, healthy and sustainable.
</P>
<P>
This idea was expressed by Asian government officials and
leaders of international institutions during the 6th Annual Far
Eastern Economic Review Conference held here on June 16 and 17.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a keynote speech at the conference, Singapore Deputy
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said Asian economies must fix their
structural weaknesses or else their economic recovery will remain
fragile.
</P>
<P>
"The signs of recovery of Asian economies in recent months do
not mean that the structural weaknesses in these economies have
been corrected," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
The Asian crisis which swept through the region like a "force
ten typhoon" has revealed significant institutional weaknesses in
the Asian economies, which include weak financial regulation and
supervision, lack of transparency and shortcomings in corporate
and public-sector governance.
</P>
<P>
These may not have caused the crisis, but they did worsen the
problems for these countries and regions, noted Lee, who is also
chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore.
</P>
<P>
"Unless the structural weaknesses are properly fixed, the
recovery will be fragile and the Asian economies remain vulnerable
to other shocks, for example, a downturn in the U.S. economy," Lee
warned.
</P>
<P>
Asian countries must restructure non-productive state
enterprises, upgrade management of private-sector companies,
strengthen institutional frameworks and support entrepreneurship,
Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Also at the business conference entitled "Hong Kong &AMP; Asia:
Strategies for Recovery," which focused on issues of economic
recovery and highlighted solutions, Thai Foreign Minister Surin
Pitsuwan urged East Asia, particularly Southeast Asia, to rethink
its strategy of growth and give priority to overall structural
adjustment.
</P>

Surin said East Asia cannot remain dependent on outside
capital, technology and management as in the past.
</P>
<P>
The region shall invest heavily on human resource development,
science and technology, research and design for new products, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"To achieve sustainable long-term growth, the region must
bolster home-bred technology and management," he added.
</P>
<P>
"This is not to say that we should close ourselves from outside
investment," said Surin. "We cannot avoid, and indeed we welcome,
economic integration and cooperation in a globalized world."
</P>
<P>
But, he said, each country and region will have to be able to
identify its own area of competency and seek to complement others
in areas where they have comparative advantages.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Asian Economies Need Structural Reforms for Sustained Recovery (2) ...comparative advantages. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Another keynote speaker, Joseph Yam, chief executive of the
Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), said domestic financial
systems would remain the basic building blocks of the
international financial system for the foreseeable future,
regardless of the forms of international monitoring and regulation
that might arise out of the discussions currently in progress.
</P>
<P>
A lesson drawn from the Asian financial crisis is that the
globalization and liberalization of markets require stronger, not
weaker, domestic systems.
</P>
<P>
He noted that as a positive outcome of the Asian financial
crisis, economies all over the region were taking important steps
toward reforming their financial systems.
</P>
<P>
These reforms should leave Asia's financial systems in a much
healthier condition and make them more resilient in the face of
future financial crisis and more capable of exploiting new
opportunities, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yam said the necessary counterpart of the reforms now being
vigorously pursued within the region was the reform at the global
level of an international financial architecture that had been
outgrown and outpaced by massive increases in the volume and speed
of cross-border fund flows.
</P>
<P>
"The aim of this reform should be not to place barriers in the
way of these fund flows, but to provide a level of oversight and
transparency that will ensure that the excessive volatility we
have recently seen are kept within reasonable bounds," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yam's view on the reform of the international financial
architecture was shared by Stanley Fischer, first deputy managing
director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
The Asian financial crisis has made it very clear that the
international financial system has to be strengthened, said
Fischer.
</P>
<P>
He vowed that the IMF will continue to do everything it can to
support the continuation of the process of structural reform in
Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
The origins of the Asian financial crisis lay primarily in
capital account and financial sector problems, exacerbated in
several countries by inappropriate exchange rate policies and
triggered by rapid outflows of capital, said Fischer.
</P>
<P>
"Thus, policies adopted by governments to deal with the crisis,
in many cases with IMF support, had to be comprehensive to resolve
structural as well as macro problems," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Of course, the structural reforms, especially in the banking
and corporate sectors, are not complete in any country, for this
is a long-term task, he said.
</P>
<P>
"But it was important to begin as soon as possible -- and
looking around the region, we see that the countries that moved
most rapidly on structural reforms are also those that are
recovering most rapidly," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
One important risk now is that the burgeoning recovery in
crisis-struck economies will reduce the urgency of reform and
allow complacency, or normal politics, to set in, Fischer warned.

<HEADLINE> Canada Aims At Winning A Berth at Olympics </HEADLINE>

<P>
SAN JOSE, United States, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Canada is aiming at
winning a berth at the Sydney Olympic Games women's soccer
tournament by finishing within the top two in group c at the third
Women's World Cup.
</P>
<P>
So their first match against Japan at San Jose on Saturday will
be vital for them as the group also includes defending champions Norway.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to ensure that we qualify for the Olympics and also
to be very competitive on the field," said Canada coach Neil Turnbull.
</P>
<P>
But Turnbull knows it will be quite difficult for them in the
match against Japan:"Japan is an experienced team. They have been
to two World Cups and the Olympics. The Japanese players all play
in professional league. They have good technique and are quite
comfortable on the ball."
</P>
<P>
Canada itself has very good players like forward Charmaine
Hooper. "She is a very, very talented player. I think I moved her
into a withdrawn attacker's position has given her a little bit more
freedom and I think that freedom is starting to pay off." said Turnbull.
</P>
<P>
Turnbull said he knew Canada's key to success:"I think the key
to success for us is to go out and attack. I think we are very
competitive with both Japan and Russia."

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Stock Market to Install New Trading System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Beirut Stock Exchange, Lebanon's
only stock bourse, is to introduce a new trading system, enabling
continuous dealing in replace of the present once-a-day fixing.
</P>
<P>
The change, widely called for by stock-brokers, will come into
force next year and will allow transactions to take place at any
time during trading hours, the Daily Star reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The arrangements were announced Friday by the bourse's chairman
Gabriel Sehnaoui, who signed an agreement with the Paris stock
exchange. The French bourse will provide the Lebanese side with a
computer software system worth 714,000 U.S. dollars in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The system is currently used in 15 stock exchanges, including
Tunisia, Morocco and Jordan among Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Sehnaoui said he hoped the new arrangements would produce
increased liquidity although he doubted the value of shares would
be affected.
</P>
<P>
Beirut Stock Exchange is currently seeing a steep fall in
transactions with a drop in value of 68 percent over the first
quarter compared with the same period in 1998.

<HEADLINE> 13,399 HIV Carriers Discovered in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 19 (Xinhua) -- A total of 13,399 HIV carriers had
been discovered in Vietnam by June 5 this year, Vietnam News
Agency Saturday quoted Prof. Chung A, vice chairman of Vietnam's
National AIDS Committee, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam discovered the first case of HIV in Ho Chi Minh City at
the end of 1990.
</P>
<P>
Epidemiological studies estimate the number of people infected
by the virus in Vietnam at the end of this year at 80,000, said
Prof. Chung A, adding that Vietnamese epidemiologists and the
World Health Organization forecast that Vietnam will have an
estimated 200,000 HIV carriers in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The spread of HIV is closely connected with increasing drug
abuse and unsafe sexual relations in many population groups.
</P>
<P>
Results of recent random surveys showed that the current HIV
infection rate among drug addicts tested has increased to 14
percent. The disease has begun to break out in many provinces
around capital Hanoi, such as Hai Phong, Bac Ninh, Hai Duong, Vinh
Phuc, Hoa Binh, Thai Nguyen and Nam Dinh.
</P>
<P>
Prostitution is still doing great harm in many aspects in large
cities and beginning to spread to rural areas. Surveys conducted
in key locations showed that the HIV infection rate among
prostitutes in Mekong Delta provinces is on the rise, and that the
rate in An Giang province in particular increased from 5 percent
to 15 percent at the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Raising public awareness of the danger of the disease, the way
it spreads and measures to prevent it is a decisive factor in
checking the spread of HIV infection in the community, added Prof.
Chung A.

<HEADLINE> Political Violence, Hostile Media Hurt Kenyan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Threats of political violence,
hostile media campaigns and growing opposition hostility against
the Kenyan government have in the past three months contributed to
the worsening economic situation in the country, the Kenya Times
newspaper said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The east African country was on the brink of an "economic
plunge" unless foreign and local investors are assured of
political stability, the ruling party's newspaper quoted some
economic and banking experts as saying recently.
</P>
<P>
The experts said that fears in the business community should be
stemmed through a committed government move to preserve security,
the paper argued in a front-page story.
</P>
<P>
According to sources in the banking sector, the situation
worsened with a hysterical currency withdrawal from major banks
after the Daily Nation, a leading newspaper in Kenya, published a
story alleging that most Kenyans were against President Daniel
arap Moi's proposal on the constitutional review stalemate.
</P>
<P>
On June 11, the budget day, a demonstration against Moi's
suggestion on the constitutional review triggered off violence and
looting.
</P>
<P>
On pending bills which the government put the figure at 14
billion Kenyan shillings (about 194 million U.S. dollars), Kenyan
Financial Minister Francis Masakhalia said Friday that the
government would settle by cash payment bills which were less than
one million shillings.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the 1999-2000 fiscal year, Masakhalia said that
the government 's borrowing from the domestic sources is estimated
at 12. 2 billion shillings (about 169 million dollars), about 24
percent of the gross domestic product (GDP).

<HEADLINE> Economic Issues to Top Talks Between Bangladeshi, Indian PMs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Indian caretaker Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee arrived here Saturday morning on a two-day
"goodwill visit" to Bangladesh, and economic issues are expected
to top the talks between the prime ministers of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee has come at the invitation of Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina to ceremonially inaugurate a direct bus service between the
two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
This is Vajpayee's first visit to Bangladesh since he came to
power early last year.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee and Hasina will hold talks in the afternoon before
jointly receiving two cross-border buses from Calcutta, capital of
India's West Bengal state.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Secretary C.M. Shafi Sami told reporters on Thursday
that there was no "structural agenda" of the talks between the two
leaders, and all matters affecting Bangladesh-India relations
might come up for discussion.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here say Hasina is almost certain to raise the issue
of the yawning trade imbalance between the two countries,
demanding a higher level of exports and zero-tariff access of
goods to the Indian market, while Vajpayee may press her
Bangladeshi counterpart for providing "transit" for India between
its northeastern states and West Bengal.
</P>
<P>
In the 1997-88 fiscal year, Bangladesh imported goods worth
935.92 million U.S. dollars from India while the size of its
exports to that country was only 65.64 million dollars, resulting
in a trade deficit of 870.28 million dollars, according to
Commerce and Industries Minister Tofail Ahmed.
</P>
<P>
Dhaka has repeatedly complained of tariff and non-tariff
barriers for its goods into India.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh is likely to propose setting up of joint venture
industries in Bangladesh with "buy-back arrangements," in an
effort to bridge the huge trade gap, while the Indian side may
raise the sensitive issue of purchasing natural gas from
Bangladesh though pipeline.
</P>
<P>
Both the ruling and the opposition have announced objection to
exporting gas before "meeting domestic demands."
</P>
<P>
Dhaka has shown interest in playing a role in mediating between
New Delhi and Iadesh-India-Talks

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Serial Killer Uses Police Guns: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- A suspected Ugandan serial killer
was proved to have used guns of Criminal Investigation Department
(CID) officers in committing crimes, the New Vision newspaper
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Richard Arinaitwe, who used to be a student of Makerere
University, was arrested with three pistols stolen from the
Kampala Central Police Station in a night break-in late last year,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
Arinaitwe was using CID pistols when killing people, some of
whom were foreigners, a judicial commission of inquiry into
corruption in the police heard Friday.
</P>
<P>
Interdicted Regional CID Officer Kampala Extra, Edward Ochom,
testified before the commission that the serial killer's finger
prints were found in his office.
</P>
<P>
However, interdicted CID Director Chris Bakiza accused Ochom of
not reporting the robbery last September and of being a member of
a racket with Arinaitwe.
</P>
<P>
Ochom denied being in the Arinaitwe racket, saying that his
failure to report the loss of the guns was an oversight.
</P>
<P>
Ochom, who is 42 years old, has been on suspension since
February 26, 1999 in connection with the weapons loss.

</P>
<P>
The general manager further said that the idea to increase the
producer price is to enable the growers to recover costs spent on
cloves picking process including buying mats, ropes hurricane
lamps and gunny-bags.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar's cloves output used to account for more than 80
percent of the world market in the 1970s but have drastically
declined in recent years due to the fall of the prices of the crop
and competition from other producers in the world.
</P>
<P>
A ton of cloves fetched about 3,000 dollars in early 1970s, but
it brings in less than 1,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
To deal with this situation, Zanzibar has given priority to
tourism to diversify economy.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Zanzibar, cloves are grown in Indonesia, Brazil and
Indian Ocean island countries of the Comoros, Mauritius and
Madagascar with production exceeding 75,000 tons annually.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar President Salmin Amour said the government will give
full support to clove growers.
</P>
<P>
It is predicted that Zanzibar will have a bumper harvest of
cloves with an output of 10,000 tons.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
has said that his government recognizes the complimentary role
played by religious organizations and the private sectors in the
provision of education.
</P>
<P>
The church is in the forefront in the construction and
management of schools, the East African Standard newspaper
Saturday quoted Moi as saying.
</P>
<P>
The president said that the church had a bigger role to play in
other sectors of the country, especially in the fight against
corruption, care and support of elderly, HIV/ AIDS sufferers as
well as street children.
</P>
<P>
Noting that corruption threatens to undermine the development
of this country, Moi urged the church to ensure that its followers
are morally upright citizens guided by honest, truth and
forthrightness.
</P>
<P>
Last week, an archbishop led a demonstration protesting against
Moi's proposal about constitution review on June 11, causing great
chaos and looting in Kenyan capital Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
About 60 percent of Kenyans believe in Christianity and the
church played an active role in the country's political field,
according to local media.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Parliament Endorses Referendum on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan Parliament has
endorsed the planned referendum on political system by rejecting a
motion seeking to amend the Constitution, the New Vision daily
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The motion moved Friday by member of parliament Daniel Omara
Atubo seeks to introduce a constitutional amendment bill to avoid
next year's automatic referendum to determine the political
system.
</P>
<P>
The onslaught on the motion was led by Prime Minister Apolo
Nsibambi, First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign
Affairs Eriya Kategaya, National Political Commissar James
Wapakhabulo and Justice Minister Mayanja Nkangi.
</P>
<P>
They argued that instead of putting off the referendum, a fair
law should be enacted to cater for all parties. The government
was interested in a referendum law which would bring political
stability.
</P>
<P>
The referendum was the best way to resolve the conflicts
existing among different parties, they added.
</P>
<P>
However, the multi-party firebrands who support the motion held
that the Constitution is subject to amendment and that amending
the Constitution is not synonymous going against it.
</P>
<P>
Uganda was already in a state of tension and instability and
the referendum would polarize the country even further, they
warned.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan Constitution, adopted in 1995, stipulates that a
referendum will be held in five years to decide the political
system of the country.

<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue denied reports
from western media and Tibetan splitist organizations that China "
assimilates Tibetans" in a resettlement project to be funded by
the World Bank (WB).
</P>
<P>
Zhang described the reports as "with ulterior motives". Certain
western media and a few Tibetan splitist groups recently alleged
that a resettlement project in northwestern China 's Qinghai
Province to be funded by the World Bank aims to "assimilate
Tibetans" and incorporate the buildup of a labor reform farm so
they required the World Bank not to finance the project.
</P>
<P>
China is deeply concerned about the confrontation, collision
and exchange of fire between the warships of the Democratic People
's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea in recent days,
said Zhang. Zhang said that whether the vice-ministerial level
meeting between the two sides is to be held as scheduled on June
22 will be decided by both sides.
</P>
<P>
China expressed strong resentment and firm opposition to a
defense bill for fiscal year 2000 and an amendment act on Taiwan
recently approved by the U.S. Senate.
</P>

Zhang said the U.S. Senate recently approved the defense bill
for fiscal year 2000, and its amendment act on Taiwan, wantonly
demanding an evaluation on the so-called gap of military balance
across the Taiwan Straits and on the U.S. Defense Department's
implementation of relevant act.

<P>
MANILA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines has launched a
tourism promotion drive by offering special tour packages for
foreign travelers and tourists at lower prices, said a senior
official Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Under the "Philippine Rediscovery Holidays" program, tourists

discounted and competitive room rates in major hotels and resorts.
</P>
<P>
The secretary said that the Rediscovery Program has two
undertakings, namely, "Tourism Frontliners," and "Rediscovery Your
Roots."
</P>
<P>
The Tourism Frontliners program involves the mobilization of
the country's seven million Filipinos residing and working
abroad to help actively promote the Philippines as a tourist
destination, she said.
</P>
<P>
The Rediscovery Your Roots program seeks to persuade third and
fourth-generation Filipino-Americans to visit their homeland, she
added.
</P>

Program while hotels and resorts in Manila, Davao, Cebu, Boracay
and Banaue join in the program by offering very low accommodation

<P>
HANGZHOU, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Continuing torrential rains have
destroyed houses and inundated farmland in east China's Zhejiang
Province, according to provincial authorities.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Zhejiang Flood Control and Drought Relief
Headquarters said torrential rains have hit parts of the province
since the June 10th arrival of the so-called "Plum Rain" season,
or the rainy season in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze
River.
</P>
<P>
Some 100 mm of rain fell in the Dongzhaoxi River Valley in the
southwest part of the province over a 24 hour period beginning at
08:00 on June 15.
</P>
<P>
Urban areas in Hangzhou, the provincial capital, recorded
rainfall of some 70 mm between 20:00-23:00 on June 15.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rainfall within a short period raised the water level of
local reservoirs and caused flooding in Chun'an, Qingyuan,
Jingning and Lin'an counties, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Flooding in some 20-odd towns and villages in Lin'an alone has
inundated more than 660 ha and damaged more than 100 houses.
</P>
<P>
The Xin'anjiang Power Station located on the Qiangtang River
near Hangzhou halted operations from 18:00 today to 10:00 tomorrow
in anticipation of the approaching flood peak.
</P>
<P>
The official also noted that navigation in the middle and lower
reaches of the Qiangtang River has been suspended.

<P>
SEOUL, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Italy's Turin beat finalist Sion of
Switzerland to win the right to host the 2006 Winter Olympic Games
after the secret ballot by the International Olympic Committee (
IOC) members here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch announced that 53 IOC
members voted for Turin while 36 for Sion.
</P>
<P>
The result came somewhat as a surprise because Sion had been
considered the favorite by the media and also by the IOC's own
evaluation team.
</P>
<P>
Turin and Sion were selected the two finalists from the six
candidate cities by a special 16-member panel before 89 IOC
members cast ballots to make the final selection.
</P>
<P>
The other four competitors were Helsinki, Finland; Klagenfurt,
Austria; Poprad-Tatry, Slovakia; and Zakopane, Poland.
</P>
<P>
It was the first bid for Turin, an industrial and cultural
center in northwest Italy with a population of 2.2 million.
</P>
<P>
Italy last hosted the Winter Games in Cortina d'Ampezzo in 1956
while the capital Rome held the 1960 Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss town of Sion suffered the third consecutive failures
following their attempts for the 1976 and 2002 Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The selection process attracted much media attention as this
was the first site selection since Salt Lake City scandal broke
six months ago.
</P>
<P>
Ten members have resigned or been expelled from the IOC and the
world sports body decided that its members be banned from visiting
the 2006 bid cities.

</P>
<P>
The other four competitors were Helsinki, Finland; Klagenfurt,
Austria; Poprad-Tatry, Slovakia; and Zakopane, Poland.
</P>
<P>
It was the first bid for Turin, an industrial and cultural
center in northwest Italy with a population of 2.2 million.

Italy last hosted the Winter Games in Cortina D'Ampezzo in 1956
while the capital Rome held the 1960 Summer Games.

<HEADLINE> Indian Caretaker Prime Minister Leaves for Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Indian caretaker Prime Minister
Atal Behari Vajpayee left for a two-day official visit to
Bangladesh Saturday, during which he will discuss with his
Bangladeshi counterpart Sheikh Hasina relations between the two
neighbors, focusing on trade and commerce.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure, he told reporters that his Dhaka visit
was totally different to the much fanfare bus trip to Lahore last
February.
</P>
<P>
Though both trips "are of goodwill" Vajpayee said, "in nature,
the background is entirely different."
</P>
<P>
"With Bangladesh we have had friendly relations since its
inception. There have been regular exchange of visits between the
two countries," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that he would hold discussions on all matters of mutual
interest with the leaders of Bangladesh during the visit.
</P>
<P>
Unlike his trip to Pakistan last February when he took a bus to
Wagah on the Indian-Pakistan border, Vajpayee took plane to Dhaka
this time and, along with Hasina, will receive the two-way buses
from Calcutta, the biggest city in east India.
</P>
<P>
Official sources here said earlier that talks between Vajpayee
and Hasina would focus more on trade and commerce than the recent
developments in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that "wide canvas" of growing ties, from economic
links to a clampdown on terrorists operating from Bangladesh, had
made the trip possible.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are reportedly working to achieve a
breakthrough agreement allowing the passage of goods through
Bangladesh to India's northeast area.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Crudes Basket Prices Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan crudes basket price
gained 0.57 U.S. dollars per barrel to 14.64 dollars during the
week that ended Friday, announced the Mines and Energy Ministry (
MEM).
</P>
<P>
The MEM said in its weekly statistics bulletin that the oil
prices have continued their rising trend.
</P>
<P>
It attributed the surge this week to the delays of the Nigerian
oil supply due to the conflict of the workers in the Shell oil
company, and the strict fulfilling of the oil output cuts by oil
exporting countries.
</P>
<P>
Independent producers and those of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) decided, after meeting on
March 22 in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, to cut crude production by
2.1 million barrels a day for one year, a measure that went in
force on April 1.
</P>
<P>
Experts tracking the world's energy market behavior put the
fulfillment of the agreement by the producers at 93 to 97 percent.
</P>
<P>
They believe if the cuts schedule continues being observed, the
oil market might recover the balance between supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan crudes basket averaged 11.57 dollars per barrel
in the first five months of this year, and that for the month of
June touched 13.96 dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan crudes dipped to in 1998 an average of 10.57
dollars per barrel, a considerable drop from the 16.32 dollars
average registered at the end of 1997.

<HEADLINE> KFOR Commander Satisfied With Yugoslav Troop Withdrawal Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Commander of NATO-led
peacekeeping forces in Kosovo (KFOR) Michael Jackson said Friday
he was satisfied with the on-schedule withdrawal of the Yugoslav
army units from the province, the official Tanjug news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The process "is going on extremely well," the British general
told a press conference in Pristina, capital of Kosovo, after
meeting senior officers of the Yugoslav military and police forces.
</P>
<P>
"The deadline for the end of operation is midnight on Sunday,
and I am considerably confident that it would be completed before
that," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jackson noted that the last figure of the peacekeeping forces
was between 22,000 and 23,000 while the full force of 50,000
soldiers would be in place in at least one month.
</P>
<P>
On security in Kosovo, he said KFOR would sign a
demilitarization agreement with the ethnic Albanian Kosovo
Liberation Army (KLA) within a day or two, which "will require the
KLA to store under KFOR control all heavy weapons, all automatic
weapons."
</P>
<P>
The commander said people should now realize that KFOR's
mission is to ensure the safety of Kosovo residents, urging all
ethnic communities in the province, especially the Serb population,
to have confidence in KFOR and stay in their homeland.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Badminton Body Delays Coach Reshuffle Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Due to unprepared human resources,
the Badminton Association of Indonesia (PBSI) has decided to delay
the plan to replace the women's coaches with men's coaches in
women's sectors, The Jakarta Post reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
PBSI vice chairman Agus Wirahadikusumah said that PBSI chairman
Subagyo Hadisiswoyo was reconsidering the plan to set up the right
training method and put the right people in the right place.
</P>
<P>
"It's about being human. Men's coaches need conditioning time
to adapt with the situation where they must coach women's
shuttlers. Some are not ready to face such a situation. It's about
their psychological barrier," he said.
</P>
<P>
PBSI plans to replace women's singles coach Liang Chiusia and
her assistant Khoo Mei Hwa. While another women's coach Retno
Kustijah and assistant Lanny Tedjo have resigned before the plan
was applied.
</P>
<P>
Tangkas club coach Hendry Saputra has been nominated to take
over Retno's job.
</P>
<P>
Liang Chiusia herself declined to give any comment while
national training director Christian Hadinata had yet to give any
details.
</P>
<P>
Retno herself has declined that her resignation was because of
the replacement.
</P>
<P>
"No, I just want to concentrate on my athletes in the club in
Jaya Raya. I feel more needed here," she said.
</P>
<P>
But a source in PBSI said Imelda Wiguna would stay at her post
as the women's doubles coach despite PBSI's plan to replace all
women's coaches.
</P>
<P>
Agus said PBSI wanted to send 14 second string shuttlers to the
20th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games in Brunei Darussalam from August
7 to 15 because it was part of the organization priority.
</P>
<P>
"The young shuttlers must have the chance to get more
experience in international tournaments, especially in the
multisports events," he said.
</P>
<P>
PBSI aims to win five of the seven golds on offer. National
shuttlers will likely take the golds from the men's and women's
team events, the women's singles and doubles and mixed doubles
events.
</P>
<P>
Agus said some top players were concentrated on several world-
class tournaments including the five-star Grand Prix series.

<HEADLINE> Canada Contributes to Indian Child Workers Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian International
Development Agency (CIDA) said Friday that it would contribute 4.
15 million Canadian dollars (about 2.82 million U.S. dollars) to
help provide educational opportunities for Indian child workers.
</P>
<P>
In a news release, CIDA pledged to support Save the Children-
Canada, a non-governmental organization, by providing basic
education for child workers close to where they work.
</P>
<P>
The project is intended to reduce the number of working hours
of children and enhance their opportunities for better employment
as adults, according to CIDA.
</P>
<P>
The project is in line with the pact adopted Thursday at the
annual summit of the International Labor Organization held in
Geneva, which banned the worst forms of child labor, CIDA said.
</P>
<P>
The "Worst Forms of Child Labor Convention 1999" aims to
protect youngsters under 18 by targeting child slavery, forced
labor, trafficking, serfdom, prostitution, forced pornography and
exploitative work in industries using dangerous machinery and
harmful substances.
</P>
<P>
It urges states to enforce the convention by removing children
from hazardous work and providing rehabilitation as well as basic
free education or vocational training.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The All Indonesian Soccer
Association (PSSI) will select 18 players for the national team to
compete in the 20th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games in Brunei
Darussalam, The Jakarta Post reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 18 players, comprising senior and junior players from
various clubs across the nation, will be selected through a series
of overseas tournaments scheduled to be held either in Europe or
China.
</P>
<P>
Team coach Bernhard Schumm has stated his intentions to take
only 20 players for the international tournaments.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four players groomed for the Games are now vying for a
place in the national team.
</P>
<P>
Schumm said that individual skill and experience were not
enough to assure a player a place in the national squad.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to choose one player who plays better than the
other. I want 11 best players who can function well in a team," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Schumm said that the players to be listed in the squad should
meet several criteria, including being able to perform as a
defender and attacker, header skills, be physically and mentally
prepared with tactical experience.
</P>
<P>
"In modern football, a player should be able to attack to beat
the opponent's defenders and to defend when possessing the ball,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
In SEA Games, the team is scheduled to face Cambodia in the
preliminary Group B match on July 31. This group also includes
Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei Darussalam.

<HEADLINE> Japan Committed to Reducing Poorest Nations' Debt Burden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Japan promised on Friday night to
shoulder heavier burdens for slashing the debt of the world's
poorest countries, a Japanese spokesman told reporters after the
first day meeting of the G7 Summit in Cologne, Germany.
</P>
<P>
Sadaaki Mumata, spokesman for Japanese Prime Minister Obuchi
Keizo, said that as the biggest creditor in the world, Japan has
taken a considerable part of the weight in curbing debt for the
world's 40 most impoverished countries.
</P>
<P>
But he said Japan insisted, as always, that the task should be
carried out mainly by such international financial organizations
as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Mumata said that Obuchi had demanded in the afternoon at the
meeting of the seven rich countries that the burden of debt relief
for the poorest countries should be fairly distributed, urging
those who have lent less to contribute more to the World Bank and
IMF in establishing aid funds.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Obuchi called on the indebted countries to
invest the capital saved through debt reduction in the field of
eliminating poverty, developing education and improving medicare.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the United States, Germany, France, Canada, Japan,
Britain and Italy also discussed the economic situation in Asia
and Japan during the first day of their three-day annual economic
summit.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi told other participants that the Japanese economic
recession seems to have bottomed, but the situation is still
gloomy.
</P>
<P>
In the second half of the year, Japan's economy is expected to
gain a moderate growth of 1.9 percent, Mumata quoted Obuchi as
saying.

<HEADLINE> Uruguay Exports More Wine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Uruguay's wine exports reached
832,000 liters in the first five months of this years, nearly the
total exported in 1998, the National Wine Making Institute (INAVI)
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
INAVI Executive Secretary Francisco Zunino said the country's
wine export was expected to hit two million liters this year.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the Uruguayan product went to Brazil, Uruguay
's main wine importer, despite its financial crisis caused by the
devaluation of its currency.
</P>
<P>
Japan and Peru also became new consumers of Uruguay's fine
wines this year.
</P>
<P>
Last year Uruguay exported a total of 1.106 million liters of
wine, 3.8 percent more than in 1997, with Brazil importing 322,000
liters, followed by Britain, Norway, Canada, Germany and France.
</P>
<P>
The country, with 9,000 hectares of grapevine, started to
export wine to the international market at the beginning of this
decade. In 1994, wine exports were only 170,000 liters, but they
soared to 1.065 million liters in 1997 and 1.106 million liters a
year later.

<HEADLINE> Most EU Countries Support Talks With Mercosur </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Fourteen of the 15 European Union
(EU) member countries have agreed to hold talks with the Southern
Common Market (Mercosur) at the forthcoming Latin America-EU
Summit for the establishment of a free trade zone covering the two
blocs, newspaper reports said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian Dailies "Folha de Sao Paulo" and "Correio
Braziliense" quoted Vice President of the EU commission Manuel
Marin as saying that most EU countries, with one unnamed exception,
agreed to establish the world's largest free trade area with Latin
American countries.
</P>
<P>
However, the Rio Summit scheduled for June 28 and 29 would not
deal with the deadline to start the free trade negotiations as
France has proposed to postpone until 2003 the talks on trade of
agricultural products between the EU and Mercosur.
</P>
<P>
Marin said he was still hopeful that the topic could be covered
by the June 21 foreign ministers' meeting.
</P>
<P>
The vice president admitted that currently the priority concern
of the EU countries is the integration of East European countries
into the community, because "it is a matter of security."
</P>
<P>
Marin said the Rio Summit will discuss important issues, such
as the EU trade agreement with Mexico, which will expire before
the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Also high on the agenda are agreements with Bolivia and Peru to
fight drug trafficking, as well as discussions to make Cuba a full
member of Lome Convention, which covers the Caribbean, Africa, and
Pacific countries.

<HEADLINE> Kidnapper of Foreign Baby Jailed for Life in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 19 (Xinhua) -- A robber-turned-kidnapper who
abducted a six-month-old Japanese baby two months ago was on
Friday sentenced to life in prison by the Hanoi People's Court,
Vietnam's English daily Vietnam News reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old defendant, Nguyen Hoang Tuan, was tried on
charges of stealing the property of a foreigner, Satoshi Sugimoto,
a Hanoi-based representative of the Japanese Overseas Economic
Cooperation Fund.
</P>
<P>
This was the first robber-turned-kidnapping foreigner case in
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The court verdict said that Tuan slipped into the guarded
compound posing as a technician on April 20. He entered the
apartment of the Japanese couple while Sugimoto was out and
demanded 3000 U.S. dollars from the man's wife. His robbery
attempt failed when the family's Vietnamese maid, who was outside
the apartment, raised the alarm.
</P>
<P>
Tuan then took the couple's baby at knife-point and demanded
that the surrounding police provide him with safe passage in a
taxi. The taxi driver turned out to be none other than a disguised
captain of Hanoi's Tay Ho District police department.
</P>
<P>
The police officers finally managed to put two point-blank
shots in Tuan's shoulder through the taxi window as the vehicle
was slowing down to stop at a checkpoint 30 km south of Lang Son
Town.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese baby was soon safe in the hands of the disguised
police chauffeur, who reached back to snatch the infant out of
harm's way as soon as he heard the shooting start.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Rebels Release 9 Airliner Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's second-
largest rebel group on Friday freed nine of the 24 hostages it
abducted from the Avianca airliner two months ago, despite fierce
fighting with right-wing paramilitary groups in the handover area.
</P>
<P>
The leftist National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrilla stressed
that they would not be held accountable for the safety of the
hostages afterwards.
</P>
<P>
"The ELN calls on the humanitarian delegation to meet
immediately in Monterrey to begin the release process today," the
rebel group said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The release had been suspended for an indefinite period of time
Thursday by the ELN because of the eruption of fighting with the
army and paramilitary groups in an area which the administration
of President Andres Pastrana had promised to demilitarize and
where the kidnapped civilians would be handed over.
</P>
<P>
The rebels would hold the army responsible for "any situation
that could happen during the release of those detained,"
imprisoned rebel leader Franciso Galan said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Army commander Gen. Jorge Enrique Mora rejected the charges,
insisting that all army troops are concentrated elsewhere in the
municipalities of San Pablo, Simiti, and Santa Rosa, in Bolivar.
</P>
<P>
Five ELN armed guerrillas hijacked an Avianca airliner bound
for Bogota on April 12, when they took 41 passengers and crew
members to Bolivar as hostages, in an attempt to pressure Pastrana
into initiating peace talks with them.
</P>
<P>
Within two weeks of the airline kidnapping, the ELN released 16
of the hostages. One hostage died from a heart attack last week.
The guerrilla now still holds 15 hostages.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the rebel group also freed 33 hostages it abducted
on May 30 from a church in the southwestern city of Cali.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana's administration has refused to negotiate with the ELN
until the hostages have been set free. It also said that it would
look for ways to ensure that the hostages return safely.

<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Direct foreign investment
in Brazil, which amounted to 10.724 billion U.S. dollars in the
first five months of this year, is still the main financing
source to cut Brazil's trade deficit, the Central Bank reported.
</P>
<P>
The deficit in current transactions from June 1998 to May 1999
totaled 32.074 billion dollars, or 4.66 percent of the country's
gross domestic product (GDP), while direct foreign investment
during the same period amounted to 31.3 billion dollars and
covered almost all the deficit.
</P>
<P>
In May alone, Brazil received 1.698 billion dollars from export
and foreign investment, enough to generate a 61 million-dollar
surplus in the balance of payments after covering the 1.637
billion dollar deficit created by current transactions (trade and
services operations abroad).
</P>
<P>
With the 9.8 billion dollar disbursement as the second part of
the 41.5 billion dollar loan by the International Monetary Fund (
IMF), Brazil's payment surplus registered 10.45 billion dollars in
April.
</P>
<P>
Fernando Caldas, director of the economic department of the
Central Bank, said the surplus in the balance of payments showed
that Brazil is regaining the confidence of the international
community and the foreign credits lost at the end of last year
after the Russian crisis.

<TEXT>

<P>
SAN JOSE, June 18 (Xinhua) -- After the final work-out before
the kick-off of the third Women's World Cup soccer tournament,
Chinese head coach Ma Yuanan said his team is now ready for the
group d opener against Sweden.
</P>
<P>
The match between the two teams here Saturday will be their
third head-to-head encounter at World Cup tournaments. The Swedish team
won the first match at the inaugural World Cup in China. The
Chinese team made it level at the 1995 World Cup in Sweden when they
edged the host team in the quarterfinals through penalty shoot-out.
</P>
<P>
"We are now fully prepared for the match. Several days ago we
had some injury problems but now every players are fit," said Ma Yuanan.
</P>
<P>
"The Swedish team are quite young and strong. Their attacking
ability is impressive," said Ma Yuanan, "But I think the team four
years ago is better than this one."
</P>
<P>
Ma Yuanan refused to predict the result of the match:"Everyone
says China is one of the title favorites of the tournament. Some
even say China has 30% possibility of winning the title. But right
now I care only about the first match."
</P>
<P>
Ma will be able to field all his usual starters except Wen
Lirong, who is serve a two-match suspension posed by FIFA after her
send-off at the semifinals of the 1996 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
As to the Spartan Stadium, Ma said the grass is good but the
size of the stadium will help the weaker team. The stadium is just
64 meters wide, barely meet the FIFA standard.
</P>
<P>
"The players are now confident and they all know the importance
of the first match," Ma said, "of course they are a bit nervous
before such a big tournament but I think they can prevail anyway."

<HEADLINE> East Timor Rival Factions Sign Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- East Timor's rival factions signed
a seven-point disarmament agreement here on Friday, calling on
their respective followers to end hostilities.
</P>
<P>
"We have agreed to call on all followers from the Resistance
Council of East Timor (CNRT) and its organization Falintil (its
armed wing) and the pro-integration faction with its mass
organizations to lay down all forms of firearms, grenades,
explosives, homemade weapons and traditional weapons such as
spears, arrows, machetes and others to the authorities, or police
in this case, under the supervision of the Commission for Peace
and Stability (KPS)," the agreement said.
</P>
<P>
The police, under an agreement signed in May by Indonesia,
Portugal and the United Nations, are responsible for security for
the August ballot in which East Timorese will choose between
independence or autonomy within Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The agreement said that both factions "agreed to stop enmity or
violence and to stop legal violations against anyone or any
group."
</P>
<P>
It said that both factions "will invite all followers to
actively participate in the popular consultation, from the voter
registration period to the polling day."
</P>
<P>
The violations of the agreement will be referred to the KPS to
be forwarded to the authorities, the agreement was quoted by The
Jakarta Post Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by jailed independence leader Jose
Alexandre "Xanana" Gusmao, president of the CNRT, and Leandro
Isaac, a member of CNRT.
</P>
<P>
Signing for the pro-integration faction were Domingus Soares
from the Forum for Peace, Democracy and Justice and civilian
militia commander Joao da Silva Tavares.
</P>
<P>
Pro and anti-independence leaders grouped in the KPS, which was
set up following a military-brokered peace deal in the East Timor
capital of Dili on April 21, also called on their respective
followers to end hostilities.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the signatories then met Minister of
Defense and Security/Indonesian Military Commander Gen. Wiranto.
</P>

Wiranto said the agreement, the second regarding disarmament of
the disputing parties after the peace pact in Dili, was only "a
moral guarantee."

Violations from both sides would be handled by the Indonesian
police, in line with the New York agreement of May 5 regarding the

Meanwhile, chairman of the Nahdlatul Ulama Muslim Organization
Abdurrahman Wahid said that he will leave for East Timor later
this month to try to persuade East Timorese to fully accept the
result of the August ballot.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, with a population of some 800,000 and an area of
15,000 square kilometers, had been a Portuguese colony until 1975.
It became an Indonesian province in 1976, but the U.N. never
recognized the move.
</P>
<P>
On January 27, the Indonesian government announced that it is
ready to release East Timor if the alternative to provide wider
autonomy is refused by the people in the region and the
international community.

<HEADLINE> Soil Erosion Reaches Alarming Level in Chile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Nearly two thirds of the Chilean
territory have been eroded, said a study published Friday by the
National Action Program Against Desertification.
</P>
<P>
About 75 percent of the arable land in the country has suffered
some degree of erosion, making the situation critical in the short
run, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The report said that 76 communes of the total 290 being studied
suffered serious, and 108 moderate levels of desertification. It
also revealed that in most of the communes, the process of soil
erosion showed no signs of retreat but was in a stable progression.
</P>
<P>
Director of the Chilean National Forestry Corporation Cristian
Palma said the problem has become more severe in a world and
national climate context as rainfall has been on a decline and the
country suffers repeated and long periods of drought.
</P>
<P>
Acting Agriculture Minister Juan Jacques Duhart said "the
phenomenon has reached an alarming and critical degree as two
thirds of the territory are affected by this situation."
</P>
<P>
The official has announced plans to invest 750 million U.S.
dollars in the next 10 years to promote reforestation. Last year,
105 million dollars were disbursed for the costly task.

<HEADLINE> ITF to Exert Control on Racket Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- World tennis governing body
International Tennis Federation (ITF) plans to bring in controls
on racket power, ITF president Brian Tobin said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Tobin said the ITF was investigating how the game could be
speeded up to make it more spectator-friendly and the first sit-
down break after the opening game of a match would probably be
scrapped.
</P>
<P>
The ITF votes next month whether to introduce bigger balls to
reduce the dominance of the server, particularly in the men's game.
Tobin said it could also introduce a power threshold on rackets
that might be slightly lower than the present level.
</P>
<P>
A machine is being developed, nicknamed the Steel Sampras by
ITF scientists, which can accurately test the power of rackets.
</P>
<P>
"The machine will test rackets to the point where we will bring
in some sort of regulation which says this racket...is too
powerful," Tobin said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
"I think there has got to be some control over them in case
next year somebody develops a (new) material. We are endeavouring
to measure that (power) in some way."
</P>
<P>
Asked if the limit on racket power could be lower than the
current level in the professional game, Tobin said: "It may be a
little bit slower, I don't know. It may contain it a little bit...
but I think what we're trying to do is to try and contain the
future development of equipment."
</P>
<P>
Critics claim the power generated by top men players,
particularly on the serve, is damaging tennis as a spectator sport.
This criticism always intensifies during Wimbledon fortnight when
power dominates on the grass surface.
</P>
<P>
The ITF will vote at its annual general meeting next month
whether to introduce bigger balls at minor tournaments. They would
move slower and bounce higher, giving the server about 10 percent
more reaction time.
</P>
<P>
Balls have remained largely unchanged for 70 years and Tobin
said he reckoned about 50 percent of the balls used on the tennis
circuit did not conform to regulations. Random checks are being
introduced.
</P>
<P>
The rules governing rackets have been very loose. Until
recently rackets could be up to 30 inches long but the maximum
length for professionals has recently been standardised at 29
inches.
</P>
<P>
Head size is also regulated but string tension and racket
weight are not. The introduction of a power threshold could mean
manufacturers were allowed more latitude in racket design as long
as the racquet's power was within the limit.
</P>
<P>
The ITF's decision to consider radical changes is a product of
their concern that tennis needs to become more consumer-friendly
in the face of increased competition.
</P>
<P>
"It (tennis) is holding its own, it's not getting any easier.
There are extreme sports and a lot more variations of sport around
the world," Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
Tennis has been "fairly dormant" in developed countries in
recent years although interest in tennis has grown quite
significantly in many less-developed countries. Tennis booms in
the United States, Germany and, to a lesser extent, France have
topped out.
</P>
<P>
"We want to be competitive in those countries and that is one
of the reasons we are looking at modification of the rules and
equipment and see if there is anything we can do to make it more
interesting," Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
Although players have become quicker between points in recent
years, a tennis match can still take a long time.
</P>
<P>
"We have to be mindful of time and not just for television.
There's still a way of retaining the climaxes of a match of tennis
-- we can refine it a little bit."
</P>
<P>
Tobin said the ITF had scrapped any idea of removing the let
rule in tennis, after strong opposition from players, and he was
not convinced a "no-advantage" rule would speed up the game.
</P>
<P>
Under "no-ad", which is the subject of a two-year experiment in
Davis Cup qualifying events, the winner of the next point after a
deuce wins the game.
</P>
<P>
"We need to see if no-ad does save time, I'm not sure it does,"
he said, adding the rule appeared to result in more games going to
5-5 rather than ending sooner.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment in Chile Up 45.5 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment in Chile in
the first four months this year increased by 45.5 percent from the
same period last year, Economy Minister Jorge Leiva announced
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in the January-April period reached 2.431
billion U.S. dollars, of which 60.9 percent came from Spanish
firms.
</P>
<P>
"These figures reveal the confidence of investors in the
stability of the country," said Leiva, who stopped short about the
"plan of shock" to be announced next week by President Eduardo
Frei to reactivate the Chilean economy.
</P>
<P>
Most of the foreign investment -- some 2.244 billion dollars --
was direct productive investment, which marked an increase of 54
percent in comparison with the same period of 1998, said Leiva.
</P>
<P>
About 49 percent of the total foreign investment went to
sectors like electricity, gas and water, while 16.2 percent went
to the manufacturing sector, 12.1 percent to the sector of
transportation and communications, Leiva said.

<HEADLINE> Athlete Dies of Peanut Allergy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Scottish hurdler Ross Baillie has
died in hospital after suffering a severe allergic reaction.
</P>
<P>
Baillie, 21, who was allergic to peanuts, collapsed with
anaphylactic shock after eating a chicken sandwich during a break
in training in Bath.
</P>
<P>
The Scottish senior record holder and finalist in the 110m
hurdles in last year's Commonwealth Games, was taken to the Royal
United Hospital in Bath where he died at 1100 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Baillie was with international swimmer Mark Foster during
training on Wednesday and both chose a sandwich with a coronation
chicken filling for lunch.
</P>
<P>
Minutes after he bit into his sandwich, Baillie realised there
were peanuts in it as his tongue started to swell and he began
coughing.
</P>
<P>
He was taken to doctors at the nearby University of Bath where
he was given an adrenalin injection before being taken to hospital
where he failed to regain consciousness.
</P>
<P>
His mother Sheila and father Hugh, who were both athletics
stars,travelled from their home in Clydebank and were at his
bedside when he died.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Tim Craft, of the Royal United Hospital, said staff battled
in vain to save the young athlete's life and he died from
complications following the severe allergic reaction.
</P>
<P>
He said: "Ross was critically ill from the moment he arrived
here suffering from a severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis.
</P>
<P>
"The sandwich he ate possibly contained peanut oil and an
allergic reaction to that is one of the most severe forms
resembling an extreme asthma attack.
</P>
<P>
"He died this morning from complications relating to the
allergyl.
</P>
<P>
"It has been harrowing treating him and everyone is very upset,
the atmosphere is muted. But we need to balance that with the need
to look after his parents."
</P>
<P>
Tributes to the athlete were led by Sports Minister Tony Banks,
who said Baillie's death was an "appalling tragedy".
</P>
<P>
"He was an immensely talented athlete with an extremely bright
future ahead of him," he said.

LONDON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Frenchman Cedric Pioline trounced
Greg Rusedski of Britain 6-4, 7-6 to enter the final of the
Nottingham Open tennis tournament on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The British No. 2 served too many double faults against the
Frenchman in the match. Despite producing aces at will, the top
seed never looked entirely comfortable against a player who
knocked him out of Wimbledon two years ago.
</P>
<P>
He was broken in the ninth game of the first set, losing a 40-
15 lead, principally because of three double faults.
</P>
<P>
Agitated by some line calls that did not seem to go his way,
Rusedski failed to make an impression on the Pioline serve during
the entire match, with just one break point to his credit, which
he failed to take.
</P>
<P>
Neither player produced any inspiration during the second set,
and Pioline's greater consistency and accuracy saw him through the
tie-break.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old winner believed that the loser should not
completely rule out his chances at Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
"He could improve his return and volley, he could win."

<P>
LONDON, June 18 (Xinhua) -- English premier league soccer club
Manchester United is to open a chain of cafes and stores in the
Far East, according to the BBC here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The first Theatre of Dreams outlet dedicated to this year's
European football champions will open in Singapore next year.
</P>
<P>
It is the first move outside the Britain for what is already
the world's richest club.
</P>
<P>
A deal for the chain has been agreed with Singapore retailer FJ
Benjamin Holdings.
</P>
<P>
"Our partnership with FJ Benjamin marks the first major step in
the roll-out of Manchester United's retail offering outside the UK,
" said deputy chief executive Peter Kenyon.
</P>
<P>
Under the 10-year agreement, FJ Benjamin will gain exclusive
rights to retail and distribute merchandise bearing the Manchester
United trademark.
</P>
<P>
The agreement covers Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia and
Thailand with first right of refusal for Burma, Cambodia, Laos,
the Philippines and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
"We are very pleased to give Manchester United supporters and
football enthusiasts in the region the opportunity to participate
in the Manchester United dream," said Frank Benjamin, chief
executive of the Singaporean retailer.
</P>
<P>
"Conservatively, there are an estimated half a million very
ardent supporters in South-East Asia," said Benjamin.
</P>
<P>
The first flagship store is scheduled to open in Singapore next
year with others to follow in Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta within two
years.
</P>
<P>
Manchester United, already the biggest merchandising football
club in the world, will not get any immediate cash from the
agreement but will receive a share of the profits.
</P>
<P>
Analysts have long thought Manchester United had potential for
greater merchandising sales in the Far East.
</P>
<P>
But they had expressed concern about the availability of
counterfeit (non-licensed) Manchester United products.

<HEADLINE> Peru's Exports Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Peru has earned 2.282 billion U.S.
dollars in commodity exports during the first five months of 1999,
up 11.5 percent over the same period of 1998, the Foreign Trade
Society (Comex) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The country's mining exports contributed a lot to the gains as
it grew by 24 percent from 949 million dollars in January-May last
year to reach 1.186 billion dollars. The rise in the mining sector
was due to a 153-percent increase of gold exports, which totaled
555 million dollars in May, Comex said.
</P>
<P>
The fishing exports grew sharply by 201 percent to 245 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, oil and traditional agricultural exports dwindled by
20 percent and 37 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Minister Belisario de Las Casas Piedra explained
that the fall in traditional agricultural exports was due to the
drop in the international coffee prices.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Comex said that imports volume during the
first five months of this year was 2.669 billion dollars, 24
percent less than in the same months of 1998, which led to a
reduction of trade deficit by 73 percent to 386 million dollars
from 1,476 million dollars in the same period of last year.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Foreign Exchange Reserves Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Bank Indonesia's net foreign
exchange reserves fell 88.8 million U.S. dollars to 15.806 billion
dollars in the week ending June 15, compared to the previous
week's level of 15.894 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The drop was mainly due to the repayment of the government's
foreign debts and letters of credit, the central bank said in its
weekly report, quoted by The Jakarta Post Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia said its net international reserves were still
above the International Monetary Fund adjusted target of 15.2
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The bank said its gross foreign exchange reserves, however,
increased 350.7 million dollars to 26.3 billion dollars during the
week. Gross international reserves are net foreign exchange
reserves plus outstanding foreign exchange contracts.

<HEADLINE> Y2K Experts Poll: Big Corporations Still Not Ready </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Big corporations around the
world still cannot relax although their confidence on the year
2000 computer problem has been building up, according to a new
poll made public Friday.
</P>
<P>
In the Y2K Expert Poll among information technology executives,
finance executives and corporate management from more than 600
global, large firms, 82 percent of the respondents now believe Y2K
will have little impact on their companies. "The bad news is they
may not realize how few of them are actually ready today with so
little time left," said a report analyzing the poll findings.
</P>
<P>
The poll was jointly conducted by CIO magazine, a publication
of International Data Group; Dr. Ed Yardeni's Y2K Center, a public
service of the chief economist of Deustsche Bank Securities; and
the Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA).
Respondents were primarily from large, U.S.-based and global firms
with the majority reporting more than 1,000 employees and an
average of 1,300 suppliers.
</P>
<P>
The majority of participants are from the financial sector,
followed by manufacturing, government and healthcare. According to
Ed Yardeni, noted economic forecaster and Y2K expert, if the
finance industry was not in good shape at this point, it would be
a major warning about other industries' ability to complete their
Y2K projects.
</P>
<P>
The poll found that 1999 Y2K project completion is moving along
well, with 72 percent reporting that more than three-quarters
complete. But 92 percent of responding companies have not actually
completed their Y2K work, and one in ten will not complete Y2K
project work until well into the year 2000. Furthermore, of those
companies still working on completing their work, 33 percent are
behind their schedule.
</P>
<P>
The survey suggests there is widespread blind faith among Y2K
experts that suppliers will be ready. Supply chain is heavily
interconnected, but only 12 percent of large companies are
actually verifying their business partners' Y2K readiness by
conducting on-site visits.
