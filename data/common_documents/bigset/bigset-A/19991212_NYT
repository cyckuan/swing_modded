RETURN OF GOMEZ MEANS DECISION TIME FOR UCLA
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; MALIBU, Calif. _ A decision looms for No. 8 UCLA: Point guard
Erica Gomez returns early, perhaps for the Bruins' next game.
</P>
<P>
   From all indications, Crescenta Valley graduate Michelle Greco
will find herself out of a starting role upon Gomez's return.
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, Greco said Saturday, she accepts it. But she
wants to start and she made a strong case with a career-best 20
points in Saturday's 86-67 victory over host Pepperdine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I want to start,'' Greco said, ``but coming off the
bench and being a sparkplug is OK, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Gomez, sidelined with a shoulder injury, likely will debut
Friday at Cal State Fullerton and be joined in the backcourt by
freshman Nicole Kaczmarski, who also scored a career-high 20 points
against the Waves.
</P>
<P>
   But there's one other option: a three-guard offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can go with three guards in a second,'' UCLA coach Kathy
Olivier said. ``I have no problem with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Greco's and Kaczmarski's play was just what the Bruins
(4-2) needed. Pepperdine (2-4) used a zone defense, collapsing on
post players Maylana Martin and Janae Hubbard and daring Greco and
Kaczmarski to shoot from outside.
</P>
<P>
   So they did. Greco had 13 at halftime and Kaczmarski had 11. By
game's end, UCLA had made eight 3-pointers, one more than their
season total and one shy of the school record for a game.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting opened up the post, allowing Martin to score points
in bunches and finish with 21 and moved past Ann Meyers into fifth
place all-time at UCLA. Meyers scored 1,685 points from 1975-78.
Martin has 1,704.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Philman scored 13 points for UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine's press wasn't completely ineffective. It held UCLA
to 38.2-percent shooting in the first half and helped overcome a
double-digit deficit during a 25-10 run of 11 minutes, 58 seconds.
Guard Rasheeda Clark scored the last 10 points of that run to give
the Waves a 34-32 lead with 2:57 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Clark finished with 19 points and Dee Braxton had 13.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves also held a 30-20 halftime rebounding advantage, but
UCLA's second-half post play trimmed that to 45-44 by game's end.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine's shooting woes continued, typified by Moorpark
graduate Damaris Hinojosa's 3-of-18 game. The Waves shot 27{
percent in the first half and 31{ percent for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rasheeda can hang with Kaczmarski, and Damaris can hang with
Greco,'' Pepperdine coach Mark Trakh said, ``but we have no one to
stop their big two. It's pick your poison.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA, meanwhile, has to pick its guards.

RED WINGS' TOP GUNS BEAT BRUINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Six and counting.
</P>
<P>
   Six games without a victory. Saturday night's 5-4 loss to the
surging Detroit Red Wings at the FleetCenter was the latest setback
in the Bruins' recent tailspin that has reached 0-3-3.
</P>
<P>
   Did Boston play badly? No. But the Red Wings' big guns got the
job done. The same couldn't be said about the Bruins, who didn't
get enough from some of their top forwards (re: Jason Allison and,
as a domino effect, Dave Andreychuk, for starters).
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Red Wings are the best team in the league at the moment
but the Bruins are in a trouble zone and the trend is an obvious
concern for coach Pat Burns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get some kind of offense out of our top two
lines,'' said Burns, who pulled Anson Carter out of the
checking-line center role and put him back on the right side with
Andreychuk and Allison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason Allison's got to get going. We ask ourselves why
Andreychuk hasn't scored in a while, Allison's got to get going. If
he doesn't get going, Andreychuk falls off a little bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys who are going to make you win are your offensive
weapons. If they don't go, I don't know how we're going to do it. I
don't care if the Lord is behind the bench right now and Moses is
GM, it's not going to make a difference. Those guys have to win you
hockey games. If they don't produce and they don't win you hockey
games, you don't know how you're going to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison said four goals should be enough for the Bruins to win.
In his mind, giving up five and the errors in execution were the
bigger problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've struggled a little bit as a line and
individually, too,'' Allison acknowledged. ``We still had four
goals tonight. We don't usually get four. I think there was more to
it than not scoring. They made us pay on our mistakes. We had a few
too many.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had four goals. Do you want us to get six? I don't think
our offense was the problem. It was our mistakes. I wouldn't press
the panic button over tonight's game. Mistakes can be fixed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins are only one game over .500 and don't look like the
desperate team they should for the position they're in.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings jumped out to a 1-0 lead on a power-play goal by
Slava Kozlov (two goals) at 3:34 of the first period. Defenseman
Kyle McLaren, despite being bothered by an injured left thumb, tied
it at 4:51 on a breakaway when he took a lead pass from left wing
P.J. Axelsson and beat goalie Manny Legace with a forehand shot.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Niklas Lidstrom made it 2-1 at 11:03 but the Bruins
rallied to tie it late in the second period when Sergei Samsonov
scored his seventh goal while Boston was on a power play at 18:08.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins got their only lead of the game at 1:14 of the third
when Joe Thornton scored his seventh of the year. The next three
goals belonged to the Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit tied it, 3-3, at 5:11 when defenseman Larry Murphy made
a perfect pass to Kozlov in the right circle. Kozlov one-timed a
shot past goalie Byron Dafoe for his second goal of the night.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bit of revenge for Kozlov, who had to be helped to the
dressing room with a little more than four minutes left in the
second. McLaren drilled him with an open-ice check, knocking Kozlov
to his knees. Kozlov looked as if he got the wind knocked out of
him and retired to the room but returned to make the Bruins pay.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings went ahead to stay at 9:38 when defenseman Steve
Duchesne scored to make it 4-3. Stacy Roest, low in the left
circle, fed the puck to Duchesne, who ripped a shot past Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit captain Steve Yzerman sealed it with a power-play goal
at 16:23 with the Red Wings on a four-on-three advantage. The
Bruins got one back when Carter scored with 21.6 seconds left in
regulation with Boston on a two-man advantage but it was too
little, too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Red Wings) make you pay for your mistakes,'' said right
wing Joe Murphy. ``Right now, they're the best team in the league.
They're better than us right now. We want to be where they (are)
and we're not there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Not there is right. The question right now is, where, exactly,
are they?

NOTHING DOING WITH BRUINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There aren't a lot of good things happening for the Bruins right
now. They're 2 1/2 weeks past their last win, most nights they
struggle to score even a pair of goals, and Saturday night's 5-4
loss to the Red Wings sank them to just an inch over .500
(11-10-8).
</P>
<P>
   It's time to state the obvious: Uh-oh.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, no one should have been counting on the Bruins running
away and hiding in the Eastern Conference this season. But
suddenly, this is a team taking on losses and taking on retreads
(Mssrs. Joe Murphy and Marty McSorley) in a year when virtually
everyone who ever pulled on doublerunners believed youth and
enthusiasm might carry the B's to, say, a conference final, maybe
even slip them into a best-of-seven June dance for the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not happening. Last Saturday the lowly Blackhawks
visited the Vault and crushed their bones, 9-3. It was the worst
beating a Pat Burns team has taken on Causeway Street. He
apologized. His players apologized. For a moment, we expected the
players to line up at the wickets and hand out rainchecks as if it
were K mart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come back another time, will you?'' they might have said. ``We
don't always stink this bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Red Wings are hardly the Hawks. In fact, Mike Ilitch's
multimillionaires handle the puck better than anyone in the league,
at times snapping off four or five tape-to-tape passes, virtually
unheard of here in hockey's dead-puck era. Let's not forget,
either, the Wings are only 18 months removed from winning their
second of back-to-back Cups. Losing by a goal to the Red Wings
carries a lot more honor that getting shellacked by the
barely-breathing Blackhawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played like we were intimidated a little bit,'' said gritty
Bruins forward Rob DiMaio, the center of the night's only bit of
nastiness, a slight dustup with dastardly Chris Chelios, ``by their
talent and their experience.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Bruins have any chance of beating Detroit, or a club such
as Phoenix (Monday night's visitor to the Vault), a little bit of
intimidation can be a healthy thing. If it translates into a fear
of losing, and the repercussions that might follow, then that blend
of intimidation and anxiety can draw the best out of a club.
</P>
<P>
   But here in the Hub, it's clear that the players don't feel that
immediacy. In large part, that's because there is no pressure from
underneath, from the minor leagues. Baby Bruins are called up from
Providence like one-a-day vitamins. Joel Prpic was Saturday night's
vitamin C booster shot. He played all of six shifts and 4 minutes
31 seconds. As bad as Jason Allison is going right now (7 points/14
games), does anyone expect the towering Prpic to knock him off the
No. 1 line or otherwise change the composition of the regular
trios? Of course not.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no one in the organization deemed worthy of stepping
in and making a difference, winning a job, stealing a paycheck,
then indifference is what you get among the rank-and-file. It's not
that these Bruins are lazy fatcats. But their game, their effort,
their lack of seizing the moment, says they're complacent.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've lost against poor teams, and you've lost against
good teams, you have to start wondering, where are you in the
mix?'' said Burns. ``As a player, you go home and you don't worry.
But as a coach, you go home and you worry. You gauge yourself, and
it's worrisome.''
</P>
<P>
   In times like these, coaches can look up and find themselves
suddenly out of work. It happened last week to Kevin Constantine in
Pittsburgh. He's a good coach, not quite in Burns's category, but
he had the ever-changing, bankrupt Pens 24 games over .500 the past
two years.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh GM Craig Patrick decided last week that he didn't
like his club's funk and reached for the old, reliable
fire-the-coach manual. Constantine was out. Herb Brooks was in. The
next four months will tell if it was the right move. Constantine,
by the way, began coaching the Pens at the same time Burns took
over the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   Will Burns get the hook here? It's not likely. But it is, to
quote the coach, a results business. When the results don't come,
no matter how justified, reasoned, or even imagined, then coaches
pay the price. We present Fred Creighton, Gerry Cheevers, Butch
Goring, Rick Bowness, Brian Sutter, Steve Kasper. In times of
trouble on Causeway Street, the perceived cure often has been
handing the coach his hat. Perception hasn't often been reality,
but that hasn't made the firing line any less real.
</P>
<P>
   If losses don't worry his players, and Burns no doubt is right
about that, perhaps they'll worry if they get the idea that they
could cost the coach his job. Every coach worries. Some even would
worry with a five-goal lead late in the third period of a
Cup-clinching game. Some even believe that anxiety produces
positive results. They are the anti-Norman Vincent Peales.
</P>
<P>
   But here are two very real worries: The Bruins began the season
0-5-4, their worst start since the mid-'60s. They're now without a
win in six games and barely remain in the scrum for one of the
lower playoff berths in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Count on this: If six games turns into nine games, 10 games
without a win, then something big will happen.
</P>
<P>
   Will it be an infusion of minor-leaguers? No.
</P>
<P>
   A giant trade? Forget it.
</P>
<P>
   Then what? If the players aren't asking themselves that by now,
then that alone could be the answer.

RUIZ TAKES OUT ANGER ON REPLACEMENT FIGHTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUNICA, Miss. _ Johnny Ruiz was feeling truculent Saturday night
and took it out on the only guy who hadn't had a thing to do with
his peevishness.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz learned Friday that the opponent he thought he would be
facing, Jade Scott, had disappeared, taking with him Ruiz's chance
for national TV exposure. In his place had come Thomas ``Top Dog''
Williams, someone Ruiz had never heard of and Showtime knew so
little about that it decided to take Ruiz off the televised portion
of its show at the Grand Casino.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 24 hours, Ruiz sat in his room at the Grand Casino
and fumed; by the time he was called out of the locker room, a fire
was raging inside the Chelsea heavyweight that he used to consume
Williams, bombing him out in 50 seconds of the second round with a
stiff jab, a body shot, and a following flurry that drove Williams
to his knees.
</P>
<P>
   When he got up, Williams said he was ready to continue but when
referee Fred Sidewinder III unhanded him, he tottered forward and
fell into him _ and that was that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't need to see anything more,'' Sidewinder said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither did Williams (24-5), who later claimed he could have
gone on but had been hit with everything Ruiz had, including
several things normally not part of the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not making any excuses,'' Willia id. ``He's a stong
puncher, but he hit me with an elbow and a shoulder. It got pretty
rough in there.''
</P>
<P>
   It was pretty rough right from the start when a seething Ruiz
(36-3, 27 KO) rushed out of his corner and cracked Williams with a
solid jab. Williams went to hold on, and next thing you knew, both
tumbled to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   When they got up, Ruiz continued to punch with a terrible
purpose, repeatedly knocking Williams back with a stiff jab and
hard rights to the head. But Scott's last-minute replacement was
game, if nothing else. He threw back, even catching Ruiz with one
solid body shot, but the WBC's top-rated heavyweight ignored
everything but his fierce purpose until he rid himself of at least
a portion of his irritation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like everything was going wrong all week,'' Ruiz
said. ``My opponent didn't show up. They moved me from 10 p.m. to 9
p.m. They took me off TV. I was pretty upset and Williams was the
only guy in front of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Not for long. In fact, not for that much longer than Scott, who
was never in front of Ruiz at all after a national conference call
on Wednesday in which he was asked his New Year's resolution and
said, ``I am moving in the same direction as Ruiz.''
</P>
<P>
   That was true only if Ruiz was heading back to Chelsea, which he
is not. Instead, Ruiz made short work of Williams, which was
essential in the situation he was in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning a decision wouldn't have been good enough,'' said
Norman Stone, Ruiz's manager. ``He had to look good. He had to blow
the guy out. The TV guys screwed themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering Williams's shaky record (losses to Marion Wilson,
Melvin Foster, Jse Ferguson, Obed Sullivan, and Dannell Nicholson)
and his questionable arrival time, Showtime executives feared
perhaps only the second half of Top Dog's nickname was applicable
and, hence, made the decision to pull the plug on Ruiz's fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't happy about it, but we decided to honor the contract
and fight,'' Stone said. ``With King, you gotta look at the A, B,
and C's, not just the A's.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz understood that, as well, and not only took care of them
but also minded his Ps and Qs. He was in the ring for only one
purpose, regardless of the face in front of him. He was there to
make a statement to Michael Grant, the WBC's No. 2 contender and
the man Ruiz has challenged to a big-money fight on HBO to settle
the matter of who is the top heavyweight contender.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, John Ruiz made as strong a case for himself as
he could.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

   Earlier, Larry Donald easily stopped journeyman Jeff Lally
(23-17-1), dropping him three times in the second round before the
fight was stopped at 2:15 of the round. The victory lifted the
(WBA) No. 3-rated Donald's record to 36-1-1 with his only loss
coming against two-time heavyweight champion Riddick Bowe . . .
Three undefeated fighters kept their strings intact when

ALL PARTIES AWAIT BELTRE RULING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Gene Orza, associate general counsel of the
players association, said a grievance would only be filed on behalf
of Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Adrian Beltre if baseball
doesn't issue a ruling by the end of next week.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Alderson, executive vice president of baseball operations
for the Office of the Commissioner, said last week a decision on
Beltre's status would come by Friday. Orza said that would be fine.
</P>
<P>
   But Orza said if the situation remains unresolved in the days
leading up to the Christmas holiday, the players association would
intervene. Also, if Beltre isn't granted free agency, Orza said
it's likely a grievance would be filed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't decided whether we would formally intervene,'' Orza
said before leaving the winter meetings Saturday morning. ``It's
pretty clear Beltre was signed prior to a time when he could be
(legally) signed under baseball rules. . . . If we don't hear
something sometime before Christmas, maybe then we would
intervene.''
</P>
<P>
   Orza said it appears the Dodgers knowingly signed Beltre at the
age of 15 rather than waiting until he was 16. Documents in
Beltre's personnel file, which the club turned over to Beltre's
agent, Scott Boras, contains documents that show Beltre was 15 when
he signed. In addition, Boras said Beltre was signed before July 1,
violating major-league rules.
</P>
<P>
   However, Orza said there was a scenario in which Beltre, 20,
could remain with the Dodgers, though he added he didn't think such
a scenario applied to this case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suppose he knew five years ago, but he's (not) saying
something because he's waiting until he's a major-leaguer,'' Orza
said. ``But my understanding is he was not aware of the rule until
recently _ this past season.''
</P>
<P>
   Orza said he is also hoping the league allows the Dodgers to
negotiate with Beltre if baseball declares him a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think (baseball) should'' keep the Dodgers from
signing him, Orza said. ``Having him taken out of (the Dodgers')
system is a penalty enough. It's their decision, but I would think
that would be extreme.'
</P>
<P>
   __ Extra bases: Charlie Strasser, the Dodgers' head trainer the
past four seasons, was re-assigned to coordinator of medical
services, the club announced. Strasser, who first worked in the
Dodgers' organization in 1972 and has spent 24 years with the club,
will now be involved in all medical aspects of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant general manager Bill Geivett said the Dodgers might
promote Stan Johnston to head trainer. Triple-A Albuquerque trainer
Matt Wilson could be promoted to work with the Dodgers. . . .
Baltimore scout Don Welke, highly regarded throughout baseball, is
expected to be hired by the Dodgers soon.

DODGERS SCALE DOWN STRATEGY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Learning the painful lesson that teams aren't
willing to absorb a $15 million contract for a free-agency-bound
pitcher and a marginal infielder, the Los Angeles Dodgers altered
their plan of attack.
</P>
<P>
   No longer will the Dodgers mandate a club take either Jose
Vizcaino or Eric Young in order to acquire right-hander Ismael
Valdes, a source said. Instead, the Dodgers are willing to make
smaller deals in hopes of trimming payroll and adding depth to the
bench and bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might have to do some deals that would lead to us doing
other deals,'' Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said. ``What we
were looking at is trying to get it all done at once. I think what
we're going to have to focus on is beginning the process, putting
ourselves in position to get this accomplished on a step-by-step
basis.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what the Dodgers will attempt to do today as they speak
with various clubs, including the Colorado Rockies and Chicago
Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Rockies general manager Dan O'Dowd is expected to make another
heavy push to acquire Valdes, who will be a free agent after the
2000 season and, being arbitration eligible, is expected to earn
approximately $6 million this upcoming season.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies are dangling right-handed relievers Manny Aybar or
Jose Jimenez along with a top prospect or two in return for the
26-year-old Valdes. One Rockies source said hard-throwing
minor-league reliever Lariel Gonzalez would be in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, talks with the Rockies broke off when the Dodgers
insisted they take either Young or Vizcaino. Young is owed $9
million over two years and Vizcaino, a sparsely used utility player
for the Dodgers last season, is owed $3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are also trying to peddle Young to the St. Louis
Cardinals, who balked because they didn't want to pay all of
Young's contract.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Cubs have become an option for the Dodgers. Sources
said Chicago will consider Young, who played for new manager Don
Baylor in Colorado. But again, the contract is the issue, and
Malone said the Dodgers aren't yet willing to eat salary.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs traded infielder Manny Alexander to Boston for
outfielder Damon Buford, and Baylor said the next step is to find
an infielder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be a glove guy, or it could be an offensive weapon
and a glove guy,'' Baylor said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs also need starting pitching, and reports are they
talked about re-signing Steve Trachsel. But the Cubs could get
Valdes for about the same price as Trachsel in 2000, then attempt
to sign him to a multiyear deal.
</P>
<P>
   If the Dodgers can trim $10 million from the payroll by the end
of the winter meetings by moving Valdes and Young or Vizcaino,
Malone said they could get back into the bidding for free agent
left-handed reliever Arthur Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Rangers were close to signing free-agent third baseman
Todd Zeile, but a source said the Mets were trying to make a late
run.

KINGS HOLD OFF VENGEFUL MONTREAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ The old Forum has been gone awhile and the old heroes
now only hang in the rafters. But to say Saturday night's 4-2 Los
Angeles Kings victory over the Canadiens was just about two points
in the standings was like taking a whack at old Rocket Richard
himself.
</P>
<P>
   There is bad blood between these two teams and you only needed
to see the brace around the neck of Montreal's Brian Savage to know
why. The last time these two met was a month ago at the Staples
Center when Ian Laperriere cracked three vertebrae in Savage's back
on a vicious check.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Canadiens say the hit was clean, but that didn't matter
Saturday when both sides started fighting 20 minutes !ital!before
the opening faceoff, during pregame warmups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't even in the middle of that, I was way off in the
corner,'' said Laperriere. ``But that was the kind of night it was
going to be. You just knew they were never going to give up.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when the Kings took a 3-0 lead into the third period and
appeared to be heading for Tuesday's game in New Jersey 1-1 on this
four-game trip.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal, which is last in the Northeast Division, came back
with two goals in the first three minutes of the period and
suddenly the silent crowd of 19,250 at the Molson Centre came to
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew there was tension in the air,'' said Len Barrie, who
was part of the pregame fight when he mixed it up with Montreal's
Shayne Corson. ``It was payback time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings, who actually lost the Nov. 20 game 5-3, certainly
could have been vulnerable after Friday's listless 3-1 loss in
Detroit. They were playing without three of their best _ captain
Rob Blake, leading scorer Ziggy Palffy and top center Jozef
Stumpel.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy and Blake might be back Tuesday against the Devils, but
others had to fill in on Saturday. After turning back a penalty
shot by Martin Rucinsky just six minutes into the game, the Kings
scored three times, including two on the power play and the first
of two goals by Brad Chartrand.
</P>
<P>
   The first came with just 10 seconds left in the first by Bryan
Smolinski and that set the tone. Garry Galley, who had a power play
goal Friday in Detroit, got another only 1:29 gone in the second.
Seven minutes later it was Chartrand and his goal chased Montreal's
starting goalie Jeff Hackett from the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost to them badly in L.A. because they forechecked like
crazy and we never got to move our legs,'' Kings coach Andy Murray
said. ``We wanted to push the action tonight and get behind their
defense. We did that.''
</P>
<P>
   But still the Canadiens came back. Jim Cummins, who got a
five-minute fighting major with Steve McKenna, scored just 1:34
into the third. One minute, 16 seconds later, Sergei Zholtok made
it one-goal game.
</P>
<P>
   Dainius Zubrus took the puck away from Sean O'Donnell and fed
Zholtok, who beat Kings goalie Jamie Storr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did we think it was over? Maybe a little,'' said Storr, who
faced 27 shots. ``But Tampa Bay scored twice on us at the end to
tie us (Dec. 4). You don't want that to happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially against the team that was looking for a fight.
</P>
<P>
   Murray called a timeout, attempting to regroup. But it wasn't
until a television timeout several minutes later that the Kings
caught their breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``From there I felt we regained control,'' Murray said. ``It was
an emotional night, but we didn't want to lose what we had worked
so hard to get.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, Laperriere was not booed during pregame
introductions. The Canadiens, however, were not so kind.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the second, Arron Asham went after Laperriere and both
received five minutes for fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he had to do it,'' Laperriere said. ``Guys on their
team told me they knew the hit (on Savage) was clean, but you don't
let things like that happen to one of your best players. I accepted
that. But it would have been hard to accept losing this game.''

`INSIDER' NAMED BEST FILM

(EDITORS: Daily News Staff Writers David Kronke, Bob Strauss and
Glenn Whipp voted in the balloting. The awards will be handed out
at a dinner in mid-January.)

   LOS ANGELES _ ``The Insider'' was named best film of the year by
the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, winning a total of four
awards Saturday in a meeting filled with an unusually high number
of close votes and unusually strong consensus in the acting
categories.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to best picture, Michael Mann's tale of tobacco and
media compromise won awards for actor Russell Crowe, supporting
actor Christopher Plummer and cinematographer Dante Spinotti. Mann
came one vote shy of winning for director; the honor was given to
stage veteran Sam Mendes for ``American Beauty,'' his first feature
effort.
</P>
<P>
   The actress category was dominated by the ``Boys Don't Cry'' tag
team of Hilary Swank and Chloe Sevigny. Swank, who won for best
actress, stars in the film, which examines the true story of Teena
Brandon, a young girl living as a boy _ Brandon Teena _ in a small
Nebraska town. Sevigny plays Brandon's girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iron Giant,'' Warner Bros.' critically praised but
little-seen animated movie, was named best animated feature, while
Pedro Almodovar's ``All About My Mother'' won for foreign language
film. The popular (for a documentary, at least) ``Buena Vista
Social Club'' took top honors in the documentary category.
</P>
<P>
   Other awards: Trey Parker and Marc Shaiman won for their music
in ``South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut''; production designer
Rick Heinrichs was honored for his work on ``Sleepy Hollow'' and
``Being John Malkovich'' screenwriter Charlie Kaufman won for his
mind-bending and original screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   Director Alexander Payne and his writing partner Jim Stewart won
the new generation award, given to promising talent. Payne and
Stewart have collaborated on ``Election'' and ``Citizen Ruth.''
</P>
<P>
   Released in November, ``The Insider'' has been an expensive
misfire for Disney, which is hoping that critical honors might
convince moviegoers to give it a look. The film, which cost
$68million to make (before marketing expenses), has grossed just
$24million. Earlier in the week, Crowe, who plays real-life tobacco
industry whistle-blower Jeffrey Wigand, was named best actor by the
National Board of Review of Motion Pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Several high-profile prestige pictures were shut out of the
voting, including ``Man on the Moon,'' ``The Talented Mr. Ripley,''
``The Green Mile,'' ``The Cider House Rules'' and ``Magnolia.''
</P>
<P>
   Runners-up were ``American Beauty'' (picture), Richard
Farnsworth (actor, ``The Straight Story''), Reese Witherspoon
(actress, ``Election''), John Malkovich (supporting actor, ``Being
John Malkovich''), Samantha Morton (supporting actress, ``Sweet and
Lowdown''), Alan Ball (screenplay, ``American Beauty''), Conrad
Hall (cinematography, ``American Beauty'') and Gabriel Yared
(music, ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'').
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dreamlife of Angels'' and ``Mr. Death'' were runners-up in
the foreign language and documentary categories, respectively.

PRINCE LEADS PEPPERDINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOLETA, Calif. _ Tommie Prince dribbled the ball twice and
looked at the rim. But he was also peering into the future.
</P>
<P>
   Prince was right where he wanted to be, at the free-throw line,
trying to cinch a win for the Pepperdine men's basketball team. But
he also was in a situation he hates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like close games, they give me a scare,'' said Prince,
a senior forward, who nonetheless made two free throws with 31
seconds left to help the Waves nip UC Santa Barbara 68-64 Saturday
night at the Campus Events Center.
</P>
<P>
   Prince entered the game as a 67 percent free-throw shooter in
the young season, but he calmly canned these two with the Waves
holding a 65-63 lead and the raucous, student-dominated crowd
yelling in his ears, almost all of the 1,971 fans pleading with him
to miss.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know you're going to have a hostile crowd when you're
shooting crucial free throws,'' he said. ``I'm stepping up, because
I'm a senior. I tried to just go ahead and knock those free throws
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine (6-2) rallied from a sluggish start _ the Waves made
just three baskets in the game's first 10 minutes _ to win its
third consecutive game. Sophomore guard Brandon Armstrong embodied
the Waves' effort, starting 3 of 11 from the floor but making five
of seven shots in an important stretch in the final seven minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just try to maintain my focus,'' said Armstrong, who scored
a game-high 20 points and tied for the team-high with seven
rebounds. ``I felt like (the game) was going to come to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong made two 3-pointers in a 2{-minute span to help the
Waves lead 63-58. But the Gauchos (1-5) stayed close, and Mark
Hull's two free throws with 43 seconds left cut the lead to 65-63.
Hull, a redshirt freshman from Hoover High, had a team-high 19
points for UCSB.
</P>
<P>
   His free throws set the stage for Prince, whose foul shots
forced the Gauchos into desperate shots in the final half-minute.
David Lalazarian made a free throw with six seconds left to provide
the final score.
</P>
<P>
   Five of Pepperdine's wins this season have been by five points
or less.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had our share of close games, and we've had a lot of
experience there,'' Waves coach Jan van Breda Kolff said, perhaps
soothing Prince's fear. ``We do have a lot of confidence in close
games. At least I do.''

BARKLEY WAS MORE THAN A GREAT PLAYER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We all watched in sadness Wednesday as Charles Barkley's NBA
career ended when he ruptured a quadriceps tendon in his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   That's too bad, because there will never be another
athlete//entertainer//comic//actor like Barkley. Never.
</P>
<P>
   That's because today's pampered superstar athletes always take
the political route whenever the media asks them a tough question.
They won't ruffle feathers, because they fear repercussions from
the big, bad bossman.
</P>
<P>
   Not Sir Charles.
</P>
<P>
   You always knew where you stood with Barkley. And that includes
the guys who were signing his paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   When he was playing for Philadelphia, Barkley had a
well-publicized feud with Sixers general manager Gene Shue in 1992.
No way was Shue going to win a war of words with Barkley, because
no one wins war of words with the Round Mound of Rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gene Shue is a clown whose only ambition is to caddy for
\Rex-Sixers owner\S Harold Katz,'' Barkley said in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The next season, Barkley was playing for the Phoenix Suns.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley was never one to mince words. That's why he was always a
media darling, and always made the league's all-interview team.
</P>
<P>
   When the original Dream Team didn't stay in the Olympic Village
with the rest of the athletes during the 1992 Olympics, Barkley's
reasoning was simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got God on our team,'' Barkley said, referring to
Michael Jordan. ``We're going to stay where God wants us to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley was often shaking hands with fans during a deadball, and
often had running conversations with fans while games were in
action. He understood that the NBA is entertainment, and had a
unique sense of style.
</P>
<P>
   Today's money-grubbing athletes should take note.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley averaged 22.2 points and 11.7 rebounds, and shot 54.1
percent from the field during his stellar 16-year career. He knows
he could have averaged more, had he gotten in tip-top shape every
year.
</P>
<P>
   But Barkley was a party animal. He played hard, and he partied
hard.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley doesn't take any NBA championship hardware into
retirement. He departs with his dignity intact, and with the
knowledge that no one prevented him from speaking his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nothing but 16 years of great memories,'' Barkley said.
``I've been all over the world. I've met the best actors in the
world, the best athletes in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've met Presidents, met Bishop \RDesmond\S Tutu. I've met
regular people who made a great impact on my life. I've exceeded
all my expectations. I never expected to accomplish all the things
I did the last 16 years. I have no sadness in my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   No, Barkley, it is us who have sadness in our hearts. Thanks for
the memories.
\Nsubheds:Rodman a Sonic? Not Seattle SuperSonics general manager
Wally Walker laughed when he was told a German sports magazine
reported that Dennis Rodman was going to sign a contract with the
Sonics next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's absolutely nothing to that,'' Walker said. ``I can't
believe German Internet has me answering questions about Dennis
Rodman.''
</P>
<P>
   The only source cited in the story was Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to Seattle, playing for the SuperSonics in the
NBA,'' Rodman said. ``I already had a meeting with Sonics owner
Barry Ackerley and general manager Wally Walker. We have an
agreement in principle.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember, this is the same Rodman who, in September, said he had
a deal with the Milwaukee Bucks. Before that, he said deals were
supposedly in the works with the Los Angeles Clippers, Miami, New
Jersey, Dallas, Houston and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe next, Rodman will have a deal with the WNBA's Houston
Comets. \Nsubheds:Expensive popcorn During a recent Indiana game at
Utah, Pacers point guard Mark Jackson went to his bench and grabbed
a $5 bill.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   Jackson felt bad when he slapped a box of popcorn out of a fan's
hands after he received a technical foul. Delta Center fans booed
Jackson, but he apologized to the fan and later gave the fan $5.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let him know it was all in fun,'' Jackson said. ``He didn't
want to take the money, but I gave it to him.'' \Nsubheds:Austin
solves Wizards The Washington Wizards took a six-game losing streak
into the weekend, and center Isaac Austin is not happy about it.
</P>
<P>
   Austin did not clarify whether he was talking about Wizards
owner Abe Pollin, general manager Wes Unseld or coach Gar Heard.
However, he said the Wizards' problems directly begins with
management.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always starts at the top,'' Austin said. ``It always starts
with the organization and it filters all the way down. I think it's
something that's always been here.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Austin's first season with the Wizards. So, after six
weeks, he figures he's got this organization figured out.
Eric Gay Although he was already an elite scorer, Grant Hill of the
Detroit Pistons has made his jump shot even more deadly.
Hill perfects jump shot as he awaits MVP status
It might be six years late, but Grant Hill is quietly looking like
he can unseat Michael Jordan as a bonafide scoring machine.
</P>
<P>
   In the past six games, the Detroit Pistons forward has averaged
a whopping 31.3 points per game. That includes a 39-point effort
against the Denver Nuggets.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Hill has already scored at least 30 points 10 times
this season. He only accomplished that feat eight times last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Hill has been on such a tear that Pistons coach Alvin Gentry is
mentioning him as a candidate to win the league's most valuable
player award. But as long as the Pistons are hovering around the
.500 mark _ they're currently 10-10 _ Gentry knows Hill won't be
winning any MVP honors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were more successful and we had a 14-3 or 14-4 record,
everybody would be talking about him for MVP,'' Gentry said.
``Obviously you have to win games to get a guy to MVP status.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he's played as well as anybody in the NBA. He worked very
hard on improving his jump shot, and that's what's made him almost
impossible to guard _ the extra confidence he has in that shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill was still working on improving his jump shot four days
before he married pop singer Tamia, over the summer. Now he has an
entire offensive package to throw at defenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the offensive end, I'm mixing it up a little bit with the
jumper, the drive and the post-ups, and I'm making it difficult for
the defenders,'' Hill said. ``I try to do it a lot of different
ways as opposed to just one way every time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the pull-up was consistent early on this season,
but this last week, it's just been a nice rhythm. Now I have to not
do too many pull-ups and not drive all the time. You don't want to
fall in love with one or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill's teammates have noticed how his game has flourished this
season. That's because it has enabled them to get some open looks
at the basket, since Hill is drawing more defensive attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost impossible to stop him,'' Pistons guard Lindsey
Hunter said. ``Once he faces up, you've got to get up on him, but
you can't get too close to him because he'll go around you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, it's hard not to say that he's the best right now. He
can do it all.''

NBA'S GENERATION NEXT: A PARTY OF FIVE WITH GAME AND THE HYPE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The future of the NBA is 22.8 years old with seven
years of college experience and 12 pro seasons. He wears the
jerseys of the Toronto Raptors, the Los Angeles Lakers, the
Philadelphia 76ers, the Sacramento Kings and the Minnesota
Timberwolves.
</P>
<P>
   A league that in recent years has been reduced to crybabies,
chokers, cross dressers and Chuck finally is in good hands. Forget
Scottie Pippen, Latrell Sprewell, Dennis Rodman and Charles
Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   He is Vince Carter. He is Kobe Bryant. He is Allen Iverson. He
is Jason Williams. He is Kevin Garnett.
</P>
<P>
   Generation Next has arrived to save face for the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, Bryant, Iverson, Williams and Garnett have skills and
appeal. They are the high-flying, slam-dunking, fun-loving fellas
who have inherited the future of the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're young guys,'' Bryant said. ``We work very hard, and
we're pretty talented.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all different. We all have certain things we do. We all
bring a certain amount of flavor to the game.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, they are five of a kind.
</P>
<P>
   They are popular with women, who want for a phone number. They
are popular with youngsters, who live for an autograph. They are
popular with rappers, who wear their jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner David Stern has seen the ``prototype of the new
millennium.'' Carter, Williams, Bryant, Iverson and Garnett are it.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Duncan might have a ring, but his name doesn't sing quite as
sweetly on the street.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, Williams, Bryant, Iverson and Garnett are hip hop from
their sloppy street clothes to their hair styles to their earrings
and their tattoos. They all have million-dollar smiles, money-lined
pockets, peach-fuzz faces and gee-whiz looks.
</P>
<P>
   They are Sega. They are ``GQ''. They are BET. They ``are'' the
NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different era,'' said Raptors forward Charles Oakley,
who is in his 15th season. ``Fans are into the hype. They're into
individuals. The whole league is changing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Golden Children are the league's defense against a
post-Michael letdown, though they guard against being called ``the
next Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's tough. That's tough, man,'' Carter said. ``I don't
really think anybody can do what Michael can do. You see flashes of
Jordan in probably every player in the league. It's tough to really
live up to him, because he did it for what, 14-15 years? Most of us
are only just beginning in this league. We're trying to make our
own identities.''
</P>
<P>
   The legends of Bryant, Carter, Williams, Iverson and Garnett are
on a fast break. Just check out ``SportsCenter''. They do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a fan of the NBA,'' Bryant said. ``I like watching those
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   If their moves don't get you, their personalities will.
</P>
<P>
   Carter is The Ambassador. He has a ``Vinsanity'' Web site. In
the past two months, his face has appeared on boxes of Kellogg's
Cocoa Frosted Flakes and the cover of SourceSports. He is a human
highlight reel.
</P>
<P>
   His stature is growing in 48-inch vertical leaps and bounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a dream,'' said Carter, the league's rookie of the
year last season. ``This is what you always think about. Every time
you say, `Well, when I get in the NBA, I'm going to be a star. I'm
going to be one of the best players.' When it actually happens,
it's a whole different situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams is The Wild Child. He twice tested positive for
marijuana at the University of Florida, which got him dismissed
from the team. He has a dragon tattoo on his right arm, a panther
on his left arm and an eyeball on his chest. Rapper Sean Puffy
Combs sports his jersey.
</P>
<P>
   He is basketball on caffeine. The Rebel without a pause.
</P>
<P>
   His magnetism increases with every behind-the-back, no-look
pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody thinks a skinny white kid can play,'' said Williams, an
NBA All-Rookie choice last season. ``I try to make each game a
highlight.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant is The Kid. He is 21 going on his fourth NBA season. He
has been compared to a fine wine. He took Brandy to his high school
prom. He has million-dollar deals with Sprite and adidas. He is
fluent in Italian and in the crossover dribble.
</P>
<P>
   His profile expands with every poster-perfect dunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I studied videotapes when I was growing up,'' said Bryant, the
NBA's slam dunk winner in 1997 and an All-Star in '98. ``Magic
Johnson's backdoor moves. Hakeem \ROlajuwon\S's postup. Michael
Jordan's quickness. I just try to take bits and pieces of everybody
and add it to my game.''
</P>
<P>
   Iverson is The Answer. He is cornrows. He is mega jewelry. He
carries the 76ers on his shoulders and wears his feelings on his
tattooed-covered arms. If you ask him, he should have been an
All-Star his rookie season and the MVP a year ago. Who can argue?
</P>
<P>
   His growing status is all that can keep up with his drive to the
basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe God gave me my talent and gifts,'' said Iverson, who
led the league in scoring last season. ``I've just taken advantage
of it and made myself better. When I play, I feel just like I did
when I was a kid in the park. I feel the energy of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Garnett is Da Kid. He arrived in Minnesota as a 19-year-old
rookie and now is known as the $125 Million Dollar Man. He played
Wilt Chamberlain in a movie. He jams to Jay Z and has his own
clothing line _ OBF (Official Block Family). His tattoo reads
``Sky's the limit.''
</P>
<P>
   His potential is as long as his tentacle-like arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great players are always distinguished on how their teams
played,'' said Garnett, a two-time All-Star. ``What really
distinguished Michael, Larry \RBird\S and Magic \RJohnson\S was
that their teams won, and they were great parts of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Iverson, Bryant, Williams, Garnett and Carter are the new stars
of the NBA. And they have arrived just in time.
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:STYLE FOR SUBSTANCE The NBA has embarked on a journey
into its future without Michael Jordan. The next generation of NBA
superstars has burst onto the scene, and has brought with them a
flair and style that defines their play.
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:Generation Next
The fashion style: It is defined by tattoos, cornrows, rappers and
Raptors. It is about money, movies and music. The play style: It is
space-age and fast. There are definitely no squares here. No more
triangles either. Dunk ... Dunk ... Dunk ... Style setters:
Anything to get on ``SportsCenter''. Jason Williams'
behind-the-back passes and Vince Carter's Heir Jordan dunks get
them as much face time as anybody.
\Nsubheds:Generation Air
The fashion style: Nikes and baggy shorts are in. So are bald
heads, wagging] tongues and the triangle, no bull. The play style:
Anything showtime or Showtime. The Pistons won with fists and
flops. The Lakers won with style and Magic tricks. The Bulls won
with Jordan. Style setters: Magic, Bird and Jordan did it their
way. Everyone else tried to follow.
\Nsubheds:Generation Hair
The fashion style: It is about red, white and blue basketballs,
Converse Chuck Taylor high-tops, short shorts and big hair. It is
about peace signs and protest marches. The play style: The game
finally goes on the offensive. It shoots and scores with fans.
Style setters: Jordans gets most of the credit, but it is Dr. J who
turns the NBA into a high-flying art form. He invents playing above
the rim and dunking from the free-throw line.

CRUSHING LMU DOESN'T REVEAL MUCH ABOUT USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's getting tough to tell just where USC stands
this season. The Trojans have lost to national powers Duke and
North Carolina, then along comes a weakling like Loyola Marymount
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   USC handed the lowly Lions their worst home defeat in school
history, a 96-55 drubbing before 2,112 at Gersten Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Considering Loyola Marymount's lone victory was against Cal
Baptist, even USC's players were a little befuddled over what the
win meant for the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really can't say where we are right now,'' said shooting
guard Jeff Trepagnier, who scored 17 points.
</P>
<P>
   If he is unsure, Trepagnier need only ask USC coach Henry Bibby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know where we stand,'' Bibby said. ``Nothing changes. It's
glaring. We got beat off the dribble just like against Duke. And
we're not taking charges like we want.''
</P>
<P>
   Spoken like a true coach, but even Bibby found plenty of
positives as USC (5-4) won back-to-back games for the first time
this season. The biggest news was that point guard Brandon
Granville finally snapped out of his shooting slump and scored a
game-high 20 points, making 6-of-8 shots, including three
3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Granville entered the game shooting just 23 percent from 3-point
range.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always told Granville that we give him the green light,''
Bibby said. ``He can shoot it. He needs to work on his mechanics.
But hopefully, one game will give him the confidence to have a
breakthrough.''
</P>
<P>
   Granville didn't realize his shooting percentage had dropped so
low, and said he didn't feel any different against the Lions (1-5),
except for the fact he finally starting making some shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel any better or worse than in the past,''
Granville said. ``I don't get discouraged. Coach is telling me to
shoot it. It's kind of getting to me in practice though, I can't
lie. But I'm still shooting, regardless of my confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everyone was making shots for the Trojans in the first
half, when they shot a season-high 58.3 percent and led 56-23. The
lead grew so big that Bibby cleared the bench.
</P>
<P>
   That meant Frank Evanisko, a 5-foot-10 walk-on who isn't on the
roster and didn't have his name on his jersey, played one minute
and scored one point.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't bad, but we knew if we did what we were supposed
to do we would win by at least 20,'' Trepagnier said.
</P>
<P>
   Especially when Granville _ USC's primary outside shooter _ gets
hot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said from the beginning of the year, Brandon is the key to
this team,'' forward Brian Scalabrine said. ``If he has a good
game, then we'll play well.''
</P>
<P>
   In an encouraging sign for the Trojans, freshman guard Nate Hair
also made two 3-pointers and scored a career-high nine points.
</P>
<P>
   __ Notes: Freshman center Kostas Charissis fouled out in just
nine minutes of action. He also fouled out in nine minutes against
UC Santa Barbara. . . . Brian Scalabrine had a career-high seven
assists, and a double-double (16 points, 10 rebounds) for the
second time in his career. . . . Former USC forward Greg Lakey, who
transferred to Loyola Marymount last summer, was in street clothes
on the Lions bench. ``I saw a lot of my friends, but tonight they
were the enemy,'' Lakey said.

TAGLIABUE LESS THAN POPULAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On January 18 in New York, the robber barons of professional
athletics the NFL owners have scheduled a most unusual meeting that
has combustible overtones.
</P>
<P>
   It is being billed as an ``Owners Only'' session, meaning it is
excluding such usual attendees as league publicists, league
attorneys, league executives and, most significantly, the league
commissioner, Mr. Paul Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the reason for this unusual pre-Super Bowl gathering is
to discuss the serious charges that the owner of the Oakland
Raiders, Al Davis, lodged against the Tagliabue regime at a recent
Atlanta meeting.
</P>
<P>
   While this isn't considered a palace revolt among the lodge
brothers that could bring down Tagliabue, it is the first time that
the NFL owners have ever met alone to discuss Tagliabue's
deportment and scrutinize his omniscient power.
</P>
<P>
   What has incurred Davis' wrath and has a few other owners not
joined at the hip with Tagliabue grumbling is the mysterious
financial manipulations believed to be orchestrated by Tagliabue,
namely the creation by the NFL's finance committee of something
called the ``executive compensation fund.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis and the five other spoilsports who are aligned with him
those owners in Dallas, Buffalo, Cincinnati, Detroit and Miami
believe the basis of this fund is to enrich the private coffers of
Tagliabue and his highest-ranking aides.
</P>
<P>
   And since the fund reportedly is in the $100 million range, it
doesn't take a doctorate in mathematics to figure out a lot of
executives are benefiting handsomely from such a staggering
largesse.
</P>
<P>
   It's known Tagliabue's salary alone now exceeds $6 million a
year, and there are those who think he's making twice as much from
the ``executive compensation fund'' that reportedly has made a lot
employees in Tagliabue's office at 280 Park Avenue wealthy beyond
their wildest ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   It's not surprising the NFL owners voted 28-0 (Davis and Dallas'
Jerry Jones abstained and Seattle was absent at the time of the
balloting) not to pursue a formal investigation of Davis' charges,
since none wanted the spectacle of a high-profile lawsuit and its
ensuing negative publicity and immense cost.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue and his league lackeys have peddled the public
perception that the 28-0 vote was a total rebuke of Davis, but that
apparently isn't the case.
</P>
<P>
   There are several owners who think there might be credence in
Davis' accusations, and that the entire mess is a reflection of the
mighty empire Tagliabue has built for himself through his shrewd,
billion dollar television contract negotiations that have tripled
the value of NFL franchises in recent years and through his sly
back room, trading-for-favors machinations that have resulted in
many NFL owners being beholden to him.
</P>
<P>
   There are owners who think that this ``executive compensation
fund'' is nothing more than a Tagliabue-instigated gimmick to make
himself and his top hirelings a lot of extra money and that
Tagliabue has fallen prey to Lord Acton's celebrated dictum,
``Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   There are owners who think that Tagliabue needs to be reined in,
and that there has to be a greater accountability on his part for
the dispersal of the millions of dollars that have been flowing out
to the beneficiaries of the ``executive compensation fund.''
</P>
<P>
   The mere fact that the NFL owners have called for an exclusive
meeting is an indication of their growing discontent, but it's
doubtful that Paul Tagliabue is in serious trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that the NFL has prospered incredibly with
Paul Tagliabue, under whose stewardship the league has had an
unprecedented glut of community-subsidized stadiums built and also
a record amount of franchise shifts.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue isn't in danger of being defrocked because he has
cleverly maneuvered to have the owners of 17 franchises Carolina,
Atlanta, New Orleans, Houston, Chicago, Arizona, Kansas City, San
Diego, Denver, Jacksonville, Pittsburgh, Tennessee, Baltimore,
Cleveland, Indianapolis, New England and the New York Giants firmly
in his corner.
</P>
<P>
   Those straddling the fence in regard to Tagliabue can be found
in St. Louis, San Francisco, Tampa Bay, Green Bay, Minnesota,
Washington, Philadelphia, Seattle and the New York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Tagliabue figures to survive that Jan. 18 tete-a-tete among
NFL owners, but he might come out of it with some of his power
diminished and might not be so brazen in the future as to promise
league money to potential expansion cities, as he did with Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   If there is anything those multimillionaire NFL owners detest
more than giving seven-figure signing bonuses to first-round draft
picks, it would be the ungodly spectacle of their own hand-picked
caretaker doing what he damned well pleases with their money.

MOURNING QUOTES RILEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANDREW BAGGARLY  
 c.1999 San Bernardino County Sun  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The first signs came last season, after the Miami
Heat rudely had been tossed from the playoffs by the New York
Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Alonzo Mourning stood in front of the microphones and tried to
explain how the top-seeded Heat had lost. He couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   But he came up with this nugget of wisdom: ``Adversity
introduces a man to himself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning didn't cite the quotation. But most observers knew it
had a familiar ring. It was one of Miami coach Pat Riley's favorite
maxims.
</P>
<P>
   There were more signs as training camp opened this season; more
confidence, more echoed statements. Mourning had become more than
Riley's star player. He had become the coach's disciple.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-10 center was runner-up behind Karl Malone for league
MVP honors last season. He had transformed himself from spoiled
multimillionaire to level-headed superstar.
</P>
<P>
   He found direction in his professional life, hit the weight room
with a determined stare and conditioned himself into becoming a
better player. And it was Riley who stood watch, pushing him to go
further.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at it this way,'' Mourning said. ``This is my
livelihood. If I don't feel the need to work at it and refine it,
why am I playing the game?
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure I work two to three hours a day and then I'm done.
I've got the rest of the day. There aren't too many jobs like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley and Mourning get on each other in practice, challenge each
other, fight like a middle-aged couple. But more than anything,
they believe in each other.
</P>
<P>
   Riley believes Mourning is the player that will lead him to
another NBA title, something Patrick Ewing couldn't accomplish
during Riley's New York years.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, Mourning almost blindly follows Riley, exudes the same
self-assured glow, believes that the Heat is destined for greater
riches.
</P>
<P>
   But there have been times when Mourning's burning desire to win
hasn't mixed well with Riley's cool resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this season, when Miami started quickly out of the gate,
Riley said in a postgame radio interview that he envisioned 20-25
losses this season.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning heard it, and boasted that the team wouldn't lose 10.
They tanked the next game at Atlanta, and Riley reportedly was
furious.
</P>
<P>
   But as they always do, Mourning and Riley hashed out their
differences.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a relationship that has defined the Heat this
season and has given it a championship feel that is unique in its
conference. The only real beast in the East, Miami appears a heavy
favorite to sweep its way to the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Who's gonna stand in their way? The Hornets? The Raptors?
</P>
<P>
   The temporary loss of Tim Hardaway notwithstanding, it doesn't
look like adversity will be introduced to the Heat anytime before
June.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to take every team seriously,'' Mourning said.
``That's home and away. East or West. Every team has pride, and
none of them want to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   True, but how many teams have a top-flight center like Mourning?
If you count San Antonio's Tim Duncan as a power forward, then the
answer is one: the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   But even Shaquille O'Neal can't do for the Lakers what Mourning
does for the Heat.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning catches the ball under the basket and scores. He
catches from 10 feet out and scores. He catches from the top of the
key, the three-point line _ and he slashes to the basket like a
guard.
</P>
<P>
   His post moves are reminiscent of a younger, more mobile Hakeem
Olajuwon. And he has the league's best head fake.
</P>
<P>
   He can go left or right off the dribble, shoot with either hand,
hit the medium-range jumper with consistency.
</P>
<P>
   And Shaq, get this: He works on his free throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to be an 80-percent shooter, but I've been closer to 65
this year.'' Mourning said. ``That's something I've been
disappointed in.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of complaining about the NBA's new rules, Mourning
worked on ways to use them to his advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's playing both ends of the floor like a madman,'' P.J.
Brown said. ``He's passing the ball a lot better. His ability to
find the open man has been the biggest key for us this season.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Riley: ``He's not settling for jumpshots. He's driving,
creating, pushing himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the one making everything work for us.''

FAREWELL TO BARKLEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANDREW BAGGARLY  
 c.1999 San Bernardino County Sun  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He threw a 5-foot-2 man into a plate-glass window. He spat on
children. He elbowed an Angolan player in a friendly international
exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when he was given every opportunity to apologize, he
refused.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Barkley gave us every reason to despise him. So why are
we so sorry to see him go?
</P>
<P>
   Why, days after he ruptured a tendon in his knee and announced
his retirement from the NBA, do we have a twinge of nostalgia? Why
do we wish he'd won that championship ring?
</P>
<P>
   Why will we miss Charles Barkley?
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't like he was a role model. He wasn't an advertisement
for clean living or unselfishness or team achievement.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't have Julius Erving's grace or Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's
poise or Willis Reed's toughness.
</P>
<P>
   And he certainly did not have Michael Jordan's singular will to
win. Barkley finished his career without a championship, one of the
requirements for lasting greatness.
</P>
<P>
   But Barkley had something else, something that allowed the rest
of us to identify with him. He had charisma. Charm.
</P>
<P>
   You could have a drink with Barkley. He was approachable.
Fun-loving. The life of the party.
</P>
<P>
   We admired his fearlessness. Barkley stood up for himself. He
wasn't afraid to discuss controversial subjects or blast a referee
who wasn't up to snuff _ league fines and columnists' barbs be
damned.
</P>
<P>
   To paraphrase Jordan, Charles said the things most other NBA
players were thinking _ and presumably, were too afraid to state
publicly.
</P>
<P>
   We admired his determination. We are fascinated by the underdog,
and at 6-foot-5, Barkley certainly was that at his power forward
position. He backed his way into the lane, using that sizable
posterior for leverage. He used that same rear end to box out on
the boards.
</P>
<P>
   And off the court, no question, Barkley could make an ass of
himself. He was involved in three separate barroom scuffles _ all
of which he quieted by settling out of court.
</P>
<P>
   He was booed roundly when he attempted to spit on a heckler,
instead hitting a 10-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   And he typified the ``Ugly American'' to the international
sporting world when, as a member of the Dream Team, he delivered a
forearm shiver to the chest of an Angolan player _ during the
waning moments of a blowout U.S. victory.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly class or sportsmanship. But that was Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   So you could understand why, in his veteran years, rookies
didn't offer him the same respect they gave Hakeem Olajuwon.
Barkley recommending a code of conduct was akin to taking golf
lessons from him. (If you've ever seen the hitch in his swing from
one of those televised celebrity pro-am tournaments, you know what
we're referring to.)
</P>
<P>
   Sir Charles knew it was time to get out of the game. He already
announced this season would be his last. The injury just moved the
process forward.
</P>
<P>
   Given Barkley's turbulent career, the abrupt end isn't a
surprise. Nothing ever went quite to script. The happy ending never
seemed to be destined for him.
</P>
<P>
   But he has two Olympic gold medals, five all-NBA first-team
selections, a league MVP award, 23,577 points, 12,545 rebounds, and
he was named one of the NBA's 50 Greatest Players.
</P>
<P>
   Was he a role model? No, but as he often pointed out, he never
signed up to be. Parents are role models, he often said. Teachers.
Police officers. Community leaders. The clergy.
</P>
<P>
   He was unabashedly unapologetic for the way he thought and acted
and played and lived. Who, really, did he have to apologize to?
</P>
<P>
   Barkley was not a champion, but he was the life of the party.
And as is often the case with merrymakers, they take the revelry
with them.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? Maybe the party's going to the Alabama governor's
office.

ZEILE RECONSIDERS, SIGNS WITH METS

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; ANAHEIM, Calif. _ After agreeing to a deal with the Texas
Rangers, free agent Todd Zeile agreed to a three-year, $18 million
contract with the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Zeile, a former Los Angeles Dodger and UCLA Bruin,
agreed to a three-year deal worth $16 million earlier in the day
with the Rangers and told Rangers general manager Doug Melvin he
wanted to talk to his wife and agent over dinner before signing the
contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, who entered the Zeile sweepstakes late in the week,
countered with their deal. Former Dodgers catcher Mike Piazza
helped seal it by talking with Zeile. With Robin Ventura at third
base, Zeile will play first base for the Mets, replacing John
Olerud.
</P>
<P>
   A source said the Dodgers talked about a three-year deal that
would have paid Zeile $12 to $15 million, but the club couldn't
offer a contract until the Adrian Beltre situation is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Realistically, the Dodgers were never a serious
consideration,'' said Zeile, who hit .293 with 24 homers and 98 RBI
with the Rangers last season. ``I never really looked at it
realistically because I knew there was unfinished business with
Adrian Beltre and I was not in a position where I wanted to or was
able to delay things just to see if that opportunity presented
itself.'' &QL;

LESS IS MORE FOR A SLIMMED-DOWN OLIVER MILLER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Oliver Miller has finally stopped growing, and started
growing up.
</P>
<P>
   And the difference between Old and New is more than just
skin(ny) deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fans mock your weight problem, toss a Twinkie onto the court
as you step to the free-throw line. Do you:''
</P>
<P>
   O) Save the Twinkie for a postgame snack, then scream ``I'm
gonna eat this Twinkie, then kick your butt for dessert!''
</P>
<P>
   N) Chuckle _ because, admit it, it's kinda funny _ then calmly
sink two free throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Gorilla mascot who last year spoofed you in the old
pillow-under-the-shirt routine breaks his ankle during a freak
fall. Do you:''
</P>
<P>
   O) Laugh hysterically at the news and show up for the next game
on crutches, exacting revenge on that ``baboon-faced blockhead.''
</P>
<P>
   N) Call the mascot at home to wish him well, because, after all,
``what's in the past is in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After a coldblooded release from your hometown team three
years ago in which the general manager relayed the news through
your mother, you're asked to comment about your upcoming return. Do
you:''
</P>
<P>
   O) Vow to ``make those idiots pay for the biggest mistake of
their life, '' after an obscenity-laced tirade during which you
almost choke a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   N) Calmly state that ``I'm going to take this game very
personally,'' then thank the reporter for the interview.
</P>
<P>
   If you answered O, you probably got a kick out of the
mischievous, Old Big O.
</P>
<P>
   If you answered N, you're going to love the mature, New Oliver
Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've finally realized that when my weight is down and mouth is
shut, things go much smoother,'' said Miller, the Southwest High
School legend and former Mavericks player who returned to Reunion
Arena last night as a relatively svelte, genuinely happy reserve
for the Phoenix Suns. ``I'm busting my butt to get back on track
because I've struggled for six years. My mom always told me, `You
learn as you live,' and I've found that out the hard way.''
</P>
<P>
   With his fifth team in seven years, Miller's dream of being an
All-Star center has been devoured by a big mouth that let in too
much food and spit out too much venom. Now, after a wasted decade
spent overweight and undermotivated, Fort Worth's all-time best NBA
player must dig in to the main-course challenge of being measured
no longer by a produce store scale but rather by hefty
contributions on the basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   Once with so much potential that Charles Barkley predicted he'd
make multiple All-Star teams, Miller now says he is, in order:
devoted father, loving son, and a 6-foot-9, 315-pound _ 60 pounds
less than his NBA weight of a year ago _ backup just trying to
salvage a career.
</P>
<P>
   Last call for Miller time.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as basketball, he knows he's about to run out of
options,'' said best friend James Gales, who used to have his
diapers changed by Miller's mom, Annie, and was among Miller's
support group of around 30 last night. ``You can see he's changing
as a person. He used to fly off the handle at little things. Now,
his main concern is that his kids have a father figure he never
had.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, whose father, Oliver Sr., left the family when Oliver
Jr. was 4 and is now in prison for murder, credits his recent
awakening to a heart-to-heart talk with his former head coach at
Arkansas, Nolan Richardson; a responsibility to sons Xavier, 8, and
Amman, 2; and the motivation to shed actions that made 'N Sync look
sage and a body that made Santa look positively Ally McBeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``\RRichardson\S just told me, `Look, you're always complaining
about how so-and-so did you wrong. It can't always be the other
guy's fault','' Miller said relaxing in the stands of the Compaq
Center before a game against the Houston Rockets last weekend.
``I've swallowed some pride and admitted I gotta make changes. But
what's in the past is in the past. I've got a chance to play for a
playoff team and be close to my sons. That's an opportunity I can't
mess up.''
\Nsubheds:Home sick Though he's still a few smirks this side of
humble and often responds to authority about as well as the Mars
Polar Lander, Miller's new milder manners have already helped him
deal with taunting from fans, similar to the Twinkie incident from
Duke crazies when the Razorbacks played at Cameron Indoor Arena in
1991. It also moved him _ at least publicly _ to take pity rather
than pride in the Suns' Gorilla being sidelined six to eight weeks
after last week's accident.
</P>
<P>
   And it helped Miller soften _ though certainly not erase _ his
wrath toward Mavericks coach/GM Don Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still the worst thing that's happened to me in
basketball,'' Miller said. ``Every time we play the Mavericks I'm
going to do my best to bang them in the head.''
</P>
<P>
   In February '97, Miller was a backup on a decaying Mavericks
team coached by Jim Cleamons. After a loss to the Denver Nuggets in
which he played five minutes, Miller responded ``I don't care
anymore,'' to a question about his limited role. Miller claims he
meant he didn't care how much he played because, whatever his role,
he would abide by Cleamons' decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, though in his new job only two hours, cut Miller
immediately upon reading the quotes in local papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of GM cuts a player before even meeting him?'' said
Miller, informed of the move by his mother. ``He's like the
Godfather of basketball that way. It wasn't fair, but he's not man
enough to admit he made a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Annie Miller: ``Was it unprofessional? Let's just say it
happened exactly that way and let people make up their own minds. I
was relieved when they released him, because looking at the
Mavericks, no mother wants her child to be in that type
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said he only told Miller's mother because he wasn't able
to notify Miller himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was on the road driving and we had to inform somebody,''
said Nelson. ``I don't plan on talking to him \Rlast night\S, but I
do wish him the best. I sincerely hope he has things turned
around.''
\Nsubheds:Final answer? Despite a tact that hits you with all the
subtlety of Morganna, Miller has always had that eye-popping
talent.
</P>
<P>
   A point guard trapped in a nose guard's body, Miller's enormous
hands are soft and sneaky, his huge eyes inquisitive with
incredible peripheral vision, and he not so much runs but rather
bounces gracefully on the balls of his feet. With uncanny passing,
a feathery touch and a 7-3 shot-blocking wingspan, he led Southwest
to the '88 state title and Arkansas to three consecutive finishes
in The Associated Press top 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always the best dancer on our team,'' said Richardson.
``He's got the best hands I've ever seen, and he could throw a
football 70 yards on a sparrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Those natural skills made him the 22nd selection in the 1992
draft, but after Big O' Mistakes in Phoenix, Detroit and Toronto,
Miller landed in Dallas in '96 playing for the league minimum.
After two more failed stints with Toronto and Sacramento, he showed
up back in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Through five agents, five teams and a lockout stint in Greece,
Miller is back where he started, but a long way from where he
began.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been around the track and I think he realizes he's had a
lot of good chances and blown them all,'' Suns chairman Jerry
Colangelo said. ``He wants to start over. So far, so good.''
</P>
<P>
   The cartoon combination of Fat Albert and Bart Simpson, the Big
O is more than earning his one-year, non-guaranteed, $510,000
contract. Almost 60 pounds lighter than last year when he played
only four games with the Kings, Miller is averaging seven 5.6
points and 4.6 rebounds per game and is usually on the court
instead of Luc Longley in crunch time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oliver knows this is the end of his rope,'' Suns coach Danny
Ainge said. ``He's an incredible talent and, to me, he's worth the
trouble. He's finally being accountable for his actions. He's
screwed up a lot and he knows it. It seems like he may have turned
the corner.'' \Nsubheds:Two kids, no seconds Along with the
nauseating feel of the noose tightening around his career, Miller
also has two little bundles of motivation and a rededication not to
eat himself into early retirement. Though his relationship with his
ex-wife remains distant, he sees his children, Xavier and Amman,
who live in Phoenix, every other day and on weekends, often taking
them to practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing like seeing their eyes light up when I pick
them up from school,'' said Miller, sporting huge gold loops in
each ear and a tattoo of ``Amman'' on his right biceps. ``I want
them to have the dad I never got to have. I want to be there for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Annie, who drives to see her son play in Houston and San
Antonio, bristles at the mention of Oliver's father. Miller hasn't
spoken to his father since posting his bond and paying for his
lawyer before the murder trial in '95. Neither claims to know _ or
care _ where he is. And Oliver Sr. isn't due for parole until 2010
for being convicted of walking into a Fort Worth office and
shooting Emmett ``Pete'' Allen, the man who pushed for the city to
declare an ``Oliver Miller Day'' when he was drafted by Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might try to contact him, but I don't know,'' Oliver Jr.
said softly. ``I just know how difficult it was growing up in a
one-parent household and I'm not going to let that happen to my
boys. Thankfully, I had a strong mom. She's my everything, my best
friend. Without her I'd be in jail or on drugs or dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important to Miller's renovation is his new-found
waist management, founded upon not ordering every dropped chalupa
to ``get in my belly.'' Last year in Sacramento, his 375 pounds led
to debilitating back spasms. Once so big he had to be weighed by
the Suns on the big scale at a produce store, Miller said he is on
medication for an overactive thyroid and is being more sensible
about what and how much he eats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not as much fried stuff or sweets,'' he said. ``And when I'm
thirsty I drink water instead of root beer.''
</P>
<P>
   Suns guard Jason Kidd, a firsthand witness to Miller's
shenanigans in Dallas, believes in this Story of O.
</P>
<P>
   ``He almost ate himself out of the league, and I think that hit
home,'' Kidd said. ``The work ethic is there now. He's not late for
the bus, he listens in meetings. He used to find ways to take all
the shortcuts and he paid the price for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Written off by the Suns, Pistons, Raptors (twice), Mavericks and
Kings, only a few people _ like Annie and Continental Basketball
Association owner Isiah Thomas _ kept faith in Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the tragic plight of Mavericks rookie Leon Smith,
Thomas said Miller should be applauded for succeeding despite a
father-less environment that can easily promote failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd jump in a foxhole with Oliver,'' said Thomas, Raptors
president during Miller's turbulent stop. ``If I had bought a team
last summer, he'd be on it. A lot of kids with his situation turn
to drugs or crime. Maybe we should be thankful he instead turned to
food.''
</P>
<P>
   And Miller's just thankful that he has two chances:
</P>
<P>
   Slim and none.

ZEILE STUNS RANGERS, TAKES DEAL WITH METS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The New York Mets swept in at the last minute
and stole third baseman Todd Zeile from the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers thought yesterday they had a deal in place with
Zeile for three years at $16 million, but the Mets signed him late
last night for three years at $18 million to replace John Olerud as
their first baseman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously I'm disappointed,'' Rangers general manager Doug
Melvin said. ``I had talked to Tom Hicks earlier today, and I
thought we had the deal done.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin said the Rangers will consider rookie third baseman Mike
Lamb, but they have also discussed pursuing free agent Tony
Fernandez, who was an all-star for the Toronto Blue Jays last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin met with Zeile and his agent, Seth Levinson, for one hour
last night. After agreeing on the length and the terms of the
agreement, Zeile told Melvin he wanted to have dinner with his
agent and his wife, Julianne, before making a final decision.
</P>
<P>
   When Melvin found out just before midnight that Zeile had gone
with the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always that fear that someone will come in at the last
minute,'' Melvin said. Pitching on hold The Rangers' quest for
another starting pitcher will remain on hold until Chuck Finley
decides where he wants to pitch next year. The Rangers are no
longer on Finley's list, but his decision could determine if they
end up with Aaron Sele or Kenny Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   Sele and his agent, Adam Katz, seem to be waiting for Finley to
make up his mind, and the Cleveland Indians offered the former
Angels left-hander a three-year contract yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   If Finley decides to pitch in Cleveland, the Rangers would
likely be competing with the Seattle Mariners for Sele's services.
Sele has expressed a desire to return to the Rangers, but he's from
the Seattle area and makes his home there.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mariners are more interested in Finley, and if he
accepts their three-year offer, the Rangers would have the inside
track on Sele.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a holding pattern right now,'' said Katz, who has yet
to counter the four-year contract proposal made by the Rangers a
month ago. ``I expect things to pick up in the next week or so.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers continue to talk with Rogers' agent Scott Boras as a
possible backup if they lose Sele. But Boras said Rogers, 35, will
command a four-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's interest on both sides,'' Boras said. ``I've talked
with Doug, and we'll continue to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin said to this point the Rangers have waited on Sele, but
he may need to pursue other options soon.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers met with the Minnesota Twins yesterday and asked
about pitcher Brad Radke. But the Twins are still hoping they can
sign him to a long-term contract before he becomes a free agent
after next season. Briefly The Rangers are interested in Giants
outfielder F.P Santangelo, a switch-hitter who hit .260 last year.
He could be the Rangers' fourth outfielder, but he can also play in
the infield.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets and the Rangers met yesterday to discuss first baseman
Lee Stevens, but a deal isn't likely. Melvin said the two teams
don't appear to be a match.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers trainer Danny Wheat went to Houston last week to check
on Justin Thompson and his rehabilitation program for his left
shoulder. The Rangers aren't saying if Thompson will be ready for
Opening Day, but Wheat said, ``He's doing a great job. He couldn't
be more farther along than he is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers signed Japanese minor-leaguer Koichi Taniguchi, 26,
to a minor-league contract. He is 19-21 in 138 appearances over
eight minor-league seasons.

 &HT;     (EDS: Repeating for all needing)    U.S. AND RUSSIA WORK TO
PREVENT THE ULTIMATE Y2K PROBLEM    (For use by New York Times News
Service clients.)    By ERIC ROSENBERG    c.1999 Hearst
<TEXT>
Newspapers &LR;  &QC;  WASHINGTON _ A small group of U.S. and Russian
military officers won't be doing much New Year's Eve cork-popping
as the millennium arrives at midnight on Dec. 31. Instead, they
will be guarding against the end of the world. Their concern is the
ultimate Y2K catastrophe: Computer glitches causing the launch of
nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles. The U.S. and Russian governments
have been working to fix the potential Y2K glitches in their
missile systems and early warning defense equipment. And officials
from both countries stress that the likelihood of a mistaken Y2K
missile launch is extremely remote. But to reassure a jittery world
public and further cut the risk of a Y2K accident, the governments
of the two nuclear superpowers have set up a joint command center
at Peterson Air Force Base at Colorado Springs, Colo., to help
protect against such an accident. The year 2000 problem, commonly
called Y2K, refers to the possibility that computers programmed to
read only the last two digits of a year might interpret the change
from 1999 to 2000 as going from 1999 to 1900. This could cause the
computers to crash; interfering with utility services, banking,
aviation and any other sector that relies computers. While most
essential civilian and military computers in the United States have
been deemed ``Y2K-compliant,'' other countries, including Russia,
are having difficulties. In fact, the State Department is so
worried about computer troubles there and in three former Soviet
republics that it is withdrawing hundreds of employees through the
New Year period. But the ultimate Y2K mishap would be nuclear war.
That's why, for three weeks starting Dec. 22, some 33 Russian and
U.S. military officers will stand around-the-clock vigils over
consoles and computer screens that would alert them to missile
launches around most of the world. Their information will be
collected from a network of radars and satellites operated by the
nearby Cheyenne Mountain Operations Center of the U.S. Space
Command. During the Cold War's superpower standoff, the Cheyenne
Mountain center was the headquarters of U.S. efforts to detect any
Soviet missile attack. The mission of the Y2K command post, dubbed
the Center for Year 2000 Strategic Stability, isn't to detect a
missile attack against the United States. Instead, it is designed
to reassure Moscow that U.S. missiles aren't attacking Russia _ if
that's what aging Soviet-era military computers incorrectly
indicate because of a Y2K computer glitch. That mistaken perception
could prove deadly because Russian policy calls for launching a
nuclear counter-strike if Moscow believes it is under nuclear
attack. The mission of the Y2K command center is designed to
protect against that theoretic possibility. Even if Moscow's
computers failed and incorrectly indicated an U.S. attack was
underway, Russians in the Y2K command center eyeing the consoles
could tell the Kremlin that U.S. radar and satellite pictures
showed no such attack. Thus, there would be no need for retaliatory
strikes against the United States. ``''We will prevent that from
occurring,'' said Air Force Lt. Col. Jon Wicklund, the head of the
Y2K center. ``We will be sitting side-by-side with our Russian
counterparts and they'll be viewing the U.S. missile information.
They will have that view that says a launch is not occurring.''
Three-man crews of Russian officers, who will be in direct contact
with their leadership back in Moscow via a secure phone link, will
stand watch with three-man U.S. crews. The three-man teams will
rotate so that the center is on alert 24 hours a day. Each crew
will include a linguist to enable team members to converse. The
Russians, many of whom are likely to be culled from Russia's
strategic rocket force, an elite branch of the Russian military,
are due to arrive at the Air Force facility on Dec. 21 and begin
training on the equipment Dec. 23. The center is expected to be up
and running no later than Dec. 30. The center also has a certain
public relations mission. ``The bottom line is that it's important
for the U.S and Russia to show the rest of the world that former
Cold War adversaries can come together and work as a team,'' said
Wicklund. The warm relations only extend so far. Partly for
security reasons, the Russians won't be allowed inside Cheyenne
Mountain, the heart of the U.S. missile-warning network, buried
1,800 feet underneath the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains. In an
assessment last year of Russia's potential Y2K problems, the
Pentagon singled out for particular concern the Russian early
warning system designed to detect incoming missiles. But even
before Y2K worries took hold, U.S. officials were worried about the
capability of Russia's missile defense system. In 1995, Russia
initially interpreted the launch of a Norwegian scientific rocket
as the onset of an U.S. nuclear attack. President Boris Yeltsin
activated his ``nuclear briefcase'' in the first stages of
preparation to launch a retaliatory strike before the Russian armed
forces realized its mistake. Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a leading
foreign policy spokesman in the Senate, said the incident
underscored that ``Russian early-warning capabilities continue to
deteriorate, and this deterioration will be compounded by the
transition to the year 2000.'' Should a glitch occur during the New
Year period, ``we want them to understand that their problems are
Y2K-related and not a result of U.S. hostile action for which they
need to respond.'' The Y2K center also is designed to make up for
problems in the ``hotline'' communications links between Moscow and
Washington. The hotlines give military and political leaders
immediate communications if needed, particularly in time of nuclear
crisis. As recently as October, six of seven such links failed Y2K
tests, according to Edward Warner, assistant secretary of defense
for strategy and threat reduction, who said the problems are
believed to be on the Russian side. ``Assured communications
between U.S. and Russian leaders is a priority at all times, and of
particular concern over the millennium date change,`` Warner
said.Because computer scientists warn that Y2K problems might take
several weeks to materialize, the Y2K center and the U.S.-Russian
cooperation will extend through mid-January. ``Not all of the data
corruption that may be engendered by Y2K is going to manifest
itself on New Year's Day,'' said John Pike, a military expert with
the Federation of American Scientists here. ``Some of this stuff
may take several weeks to propagate through the system.'' Russian
officials maintain that any Y2K concerns are dramatically
overstated. Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Bulgak said the Y2K
problem would not threaten his country's nuclear missiles or its
nuclear power stations.The U.S. and Russia last year began
discussions to set up the Y2K center but temporarily broke off
talks after NATO bombed Serbia, a Russian ally, during the conflict
in Kosovo. To guard against any future computer glitches or
potentially deadly mistakes like the 1995 incident, the two
countries are planning to open a permanent joint missile warning
center in Moscow next year. As far as the U.S. nuclear arsenal is
concerned, Pentagon officials say the chances are ``extremely
remote'' that there could be an accidental launch caused by
military computers confused about the date change. The White House,
in its final report on the readiness of U.S. computers, debunked
worries about a misfired nuclear missile. ``Y2K problems will not
cause nuclear weapons to launch themselves,`` it said. ``Nuclear
weapons launch requires human intervention.``Computers are the
backbone of the U.S. military, arrayed on key weapons like nuclear
missiles, tanks, jets and rocket launchers. In fact, the Pentagon
is the largest user of computer systems in the world. In
preparation for Y2K, the Pentagon has sunk $3.7 billion in upgrades
to deal with the problem. The U.S. military has 2,107 so-called
``mission critical'' systems _ those considered essential for
waging war _ deployed on weaponry and command posts. Defense
Secretary William Cohen vowed that all will be ``Y2K compliant'' by
the New Year. Lt. Col. Gary Warren, the Y2K program manager for the
Air Force's Space Command, which is responsible for maintaining
U.S. missile-detection radars and satellites, said the service has
worked three years on updating its computers. ``We've checked them,
we've rechecked them. They're ready,'' Warren said.  &UR; --- &QL;  &LR;  (Eric

 &HT;    Front-runner can call the shots on debatesBy Scott S.
Greenberger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Before they gathered in a New Hampshire
television studio to discuss education and taxes, Republican
presidential candidates argued about apple crates.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, who is 5-foot-6, wanted to stand on one during the
debate so he wouldn't appear much shorter than his competitors. But
if Bauer was going to stand on an apple crate, the other candidates
wanted crates, too.
</P>
<P>
   Modern televised debates are heavily scripted, with campaigns
haggling with each other and television sponsors over seemingly
trivial details such as camera angles and microphones, as well as
weightier ones such as how the questions will be organized and who
will ask them. Because the candidates trailing in the polls are
desperate for media exposure and a chance to challenge the
front-runner, the leader _ in this case, Texas Gov. George W. Bush
_ has a lot of leverage when it comes to how the debates are
structured. The format helps determine whether voters will get the
information they need to compare candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Like any front-runner, Bush has little to gain and much to lose
from a free-for-all debate format that leaves him vulnerable to
opponents' attacks or unexpected questions. And while the Bush
campaign denies it, some of the governor's campaign rivals say he
has used his front-runner status to make the last two debates
stiff, stilted and virtually useless to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``It strikes me that in the debate negotiations they seem to
want them to be as structured as possible. It leaves me to wonder
what they're trying to protect the governor from,'' said Jeff
Flint, an aide to Sen. Orrin Hatch, (R-Utah). Flint was alluding to
the perception that Bush doesn't have a firm grasp of policy
specifics.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokesman Scott McClellan called the idea that
Bush is dictating debate terms ``ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The debate formats are up to the debate organizers. We simply
want to make sure that all the candidates have the opportunity to
fully express their ideas in a fair process,'' McClellan said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Dec. 2 debate in Manchester, N.H., the
candidates met in Phoenix last week. They will gather again in Des
Moines on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush has been trying to shape the last two debates _ the only
two he has attended _ the strategy hasn't helped him much. Even
some of his supporters say his noted affability hasn't come through
on television, and while he hasn't made a major mistake, he hasn't
shined either. In recent days, the governor has fallen behind Sen.
John McCain (R-Ariz.) in the New Hampshire polls, although it isn't
clear whether the change is connected to his debate performance.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch has proposed that the candidates tour New Hampshire and
Iowa together and engage in more open debates in the style of
Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas, when both were campaigning in
1858 for election to the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's leave our spinners, our handlers and the strategists
behind, and the six of us get on a bus together and campaign
directly with the American people,'' Hatch said at the conclusion
of the New Hampshire event.
</P>
<P>
   But the forums so far resemble joint news conferences, with
limited opportunities for the candidates to actually debate each
other. Part of the problem is that with six candidates running for
the GOP nomination, it's difficult to spark the substantial,
one-on-one sparring that would give voters a better opportunity to
compare candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In the New Hampshire debate, two reporters fired separate
questions at each of the six candidates. A candidate could use his
limited response time to address the policy positions or statements
of another, but the GOP contenders did not debate each other
directly.
</P>
<P>
   The second debate on Dec. 6 in Phoenix added a twist. Although
it also featured reporters asking questions, part of the program
allowed the candidates to question each other. But most of the
candidates, including Bush, used the opportunity to tout their own
views or accomplishments and then ask another candidate to comment
on them.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hannon, political director for Phoenix debate sponsor CNN,
said that was unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can try to devise clever formats and tricky schemes to try
to turn the debate into a pro-wrestling match, but ultimately it's
up to the candidates to present themselves and decide what they
want to say,'' Hannon said. ``Voters are smart, and they can tell
if someone's relying on memorized answers or giving self-serving
speeches.''
</P>
<P>
   When the candidates meet againMonday night in Des Moines, they
will be able to question one another in a more freewheeling format
than the one in Phoenix, according to Joe Mahoney of debate sponsor
WHO-TV. In addition to their own questions, the reporters will ask
questions that citizens submitted to the station's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney said the Bush camp didn't exert undue influence on
Monday night's format. But Bill Dal Col, the campaign manager for
publisher Steve Forbes, thinks otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course they tell you that,'' Dal Col said. ``But when it
appears that Bush came to them with the date and set it up, I
guarantee there was a conversation about `this is the format we
like.' Anyone who thinks otherwise is naive.''
</P>
<P>
   Dal Col claims that Bush agreed to the Phoenix debate because he
thought that Forbes and McCain, his two closest competitors,
wouldn't be able to make it. When Forbes accepted, Dal Col said, he
got a call from a surprised Bush staffer who said he thought Forbes
wouldn't be there. McCain, who was campaigning in New Hampshire,
participated via satellite.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of format, Dal Col says, the Bush camp has tried to
make sure that candidates aren't asked the same questions. ``If
everybody had the same question, his answer could be compared to
the other candidates, and in that case he'd be in serious
trouble,'' Dal Col said. ``Unless it's a scripted, prearranged
question you know is coming, like education or tax relief, he
definitely comes out as less than outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   McClellan dismissed Dal Col's charges. ``It's totally ridiculous
to think we can tell the likes of Tom Brokaw, (Fox News Channel's)
Brit Hume, (New Hampshire anchor) Karen Brown and the gang at CNN
what questions to ask and how to ask them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hannon of CNN said Dal Col's assertions ``are typical of
campaigns that are running behind in the polls and in
fund-raising.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In every cycle, there's a debate about debates,'' he said.
``The lower you are in the polls, the more aggressive you are in
pushing debates. The higher you are, the more cautious you are and
the more circumspect.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hannon also noted that depending on their standing in the
polls, candidates have ``varying degrees of leverage'' in hashing
out the format.
</P>
<P>
   Diana Carlin, a professor of communication studies at the
University of Kansas who serves on the national advisory board on
presidential debates, said that ``any front-runner is going to call
more of the shots.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they aren't happy with it, they're not going to show up.
And people aren't going to watch the other candidates if the
front-runner doesn't show up,'' Carlin said.
</P>
<P>
   TUNE IN FOR GOP DEBATE
</P>
<P>
   Monday's Republican presidential debate in Des Moines, Iowa,
will be broadcast on MSNBC from 8 to 9:30 p.m. EST.

 &HT;    Reversal of Miranda seems historically inappropriate
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Joe, you probably didn't go out looking for this
fellow with the purpose of shooting him. My guess is, however, that
you expected something from him and that's why you carried a gun.
You knew him for what he was _ no good. Then when you met him, he
probably started using foul, abusive language and he gave some
indication that he was about to pull a gun on you, and that's when
you had to act to save your own life. That's about it. Isn't it,
Joe?

   _ 1962 law enforcement manual on criminal interrogation and
confessions
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials used to be instructed to obtain
admissions of guilt by offering such scenarios. In the widely used
Inbau &AMP; Reid manual (quoted above), the interrogator also was
advised how to eliminate any possibility of a self-defense argument
after getting Joe to ``confess.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Miranda v. Arizona that
an individual taken into custody must be warned of his right to
remain silent and his right to an attorney _ and, if indigent, to a
state-paid one. The court said Miranda warnings were
constitutionally required. But in 1968, Congress approved an
exception: If a prosecutor can show that a confession was given
voluntarily when a suspect was arrested and that the individual's
rights weren't violated by police, the confession ought not be
excluded solely because the Miranda warnings weren't given
beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for the first time in 30 years, a case based on the use of
that statute will be heard by the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Association of District Attorneys voted last week to
support a friend-of-the-court brief asking the Supreme Court to
overturn Miranda.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put me down in the column of folks who would like to see
Miranda changed,'' says Bob Keller, Clayton County district
attorney and member of the state Prosecuting Attorneys Council. J.
Tom Morgan, DeKalb County's district attorney, feels the same way.
</P>
<P>
   That's disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when Georgia, like most states, has increasing numbers
of immigrants who, like Ernesto Miranda more than 30 years ago,
don't understand the basic rights the Constitution guarantees every
person _ rich, poor, citizen or not _ the rule seems more necessary
than ever.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that law enforcement has come a long way since the
Miranda ruling was handed down. Back then, the Supreme Court had
evidence of police trickery, lying and physical abuse in extracting
``voluntary'' confessions. Prosecutors today are far more
professional, although Morgan concedes that trying to get a
confession prior to taking a suspect into custody is still a useful
tool. (Miranda warnings are required only after an arrest.) ``We
teach our people to interrogate and then arrest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Emory law Professor A. Morgan Cloud says the Miranda rule hasn't
ended confessions, and he sees no reason to toss the rule away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a huge success in terms of educating the public,''
he said, noting that Miranda warnings are part of popular culture,
re-enacted in movies and television shows. Some prosecutors are
criticizing the Clinton administration for not defending the 1968
post-Miranda law, but no administration _ from Nixon to Carter to
Bush _ has done so.
</P>
<P>
   Cloud says there are so many ``procedural peculiarities'' in
Dickerson v. U.S. (the current case before the court) that he's not
sure the justices will even reach the constitutional issue. But if
they do, he worries that it could be a close call. Justice Antonin
Scalia has openly questioned whether Miranda is constitutionally
required, and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said 15 years ago that
she wouldn't have voted for it _ although she may feel differently
today.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, prosecutors have found that too much reliance on a
confession can stand in the way of a complete investigation.
</P>
<P>
   With a panoply of new truth-getting tools at their disposal,
it's hard to understand why prosecutors still oppose
constitutionally guaranteeing Miranda safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they should go back and read the words of Chief Justice
John Marshall in 1821. The rights guaranteed in the Fifth and Sixth
amendments, he said, were secured ``for ages to come, and designed
to approach immortality as nearly as human institutions can
approach it.''

 &HT;    Young soldiers in Sienna long for second chance at childhood
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone _ Abibu Hawad is 10 years old, and in the
past year he has cut off the hands of more people than he can
remember.
</P>
<P>
   But he remembers the first time. It was soon after he was
abducted.
</P>
<P>
   Abibu was living with his grandmother in Freetown, the capital
of Sierra Leone, in January when rebels in his country's brutal
civil war stormed the city. He was in a marketplace, and he and his
grandmother became separated in the panic.
</P>
<P>
   He ran, but the rebels caught him as they had so many children
before. Now he was theirs; soon he would become one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was asked to kill people and perform other atrocities,'' he
said recently. ``I refused, but they threatened to kill me, so I
did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Abibu is no more than 4 feet tall, but the rebels issued him an
AK-47 _ a Soviet-made assault rifle that weighs nearly 10 pounds
and is capable of firing 400 rounds a minute.
</P>
<P>
   He knew that if he put the gun down, he would be killed. He
fired it during attacks on villages as the rebels retreated from
Freetown, but he said he does not know if he killed anyone.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels forced Abibu to drink rum and smoke marijuana and
then to perform what he called the ``other atrocities'' _ lopping
off the hands of civilians with a machete. The first person whose
hand Abibu severed was that of an old woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``She begged me,'' the little boy recalled. ``I said I had to do
it or I would get in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Stories like his are bitterly common in Sierra Leone.
International aid groups estimate that 5,000 to 10,000 children
have fought in the civil war, which began in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in theory, the war is over. In July, the elected president,
Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, and the chief rebel leader, Foday Sankoh,
signed a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But for many of the children, who, like Abibu, were both the
victims of vicious crimes and the perpetrators, the war goes on.
Going home and becoming a kid again is no easy task, said Roisin de
Burca, a child protection officer with UNICEF, the United Nations
Children's Fund, in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Helping these children is difficult. But UNICEF's effort is
being augmented by some of the $1 billion donated to United
Nations-related causes by Ted Turner, the Atlanta billionaire and
founder of CNN.
</P>
<P>
   After Turner said in 1997 that he would donate $100 million a
year for 10 years to U.N. projects, he created the U.N. Foundation
to disburse the money. In the first round of grants, announced in
May 1998, the foundation said it was giving $1.1 million to UNICEF
for ``demobilization of child soldiers in Sierra Leone.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the rebels swept through Freetown in January, killing,
looting and burning, foreigners working for UNICEF and other
international organizations were evacuated. UNICEF was unable to
begin using the Turner money until March.
</P>
<P>
   Now the grant is being used to provide former child soldiers
with interim care, psychological counseling and other support as
they try to fit back into their homes and villages.
</P>
<P>
   But can children return to normal, productive lives after they
have been abducted and forced to kill and mutilate and after
witnessing the deaths of friends and family?
</P>
<P>
   ``You always have a better chance with the younger ones,'' de
Burca said. ``You can get them back to their families. You can get
them back to schools. You can get them back to structures. And you
have more time. The older ones I'm really worried for.''
</P>
<P>
   Children who started fighting when the war began are now in
their late teens or older. They have not attended school, they
cannot read and they have no way other than looting to support
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But even the younger children _ those who have escaped or been
released and who want to change _ face problems. Their difficulties
range from being bullies to harboring fear and rage _ and having
families that do not want them back.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the former young soldiers have reason for rage. Ibrahim
Massaquoi's eyes blaze when he remembers the day four years ago
when rebels burst into his home in eastern Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels killed Ibrahim's father in front of him, his mother,
his three sisters and five brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They cut his throat with a knife,'' Ibrahim said. ``I was 11
years old.''
</P>
<P>
   He thinks the soldier who did it was 9.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, when Ibrahim was 13 and disgusted that he could
not attend school in the rebel-held area where he lived, he decided
the time to fight had come.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the Kamajohs, a tribal group with secret initiation
rites that members believe render them immune even from bullets.
Ibrahim took a bullet in his right foot, but he did not die _ and
so he believes.
</P>
<P>
   The Kamajohs and similar groups formed fighting forces that
supported the government and fought to protect villages from rebel
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We killed, but it was in battle,'' Ibrahim said.
</P>
<P>
   Now 15, Ibrahim is trying to set aside his anger. But the rage
still shows.
</P>
<P>
   He attends St. Andrew's Secondary School in the city of Bo with
35 other former child soldiers from both sides of the conflict. The
school receives Turner money from UNICEF, through the Council of
Churches of Sierra Leone, to support its work to help former child
combatants.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no problems between former fighters from
different factions and no hostility shown by students who were
never soldiers, according to the principal, the Rev. S.M. Bayoh.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spoke to them, and they are brothers and sisters,'' Bayoh
said, noting that the school may accept 100 more former child
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The degree to which Turner's money helps this generation of
Sierra Leonean youths lead peaceful lives will take years to
determine. UNICEF officials are trying to use the money
effectively. De Burca is working to have a Sierra Leonean
organization involved in each program because international workers
evacuate when fighting flares.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first shot in the air, you'll be gone,'' she said. ``The
program will stop, and we can't have that.''
</P>
<P>
   She wants the other groups, sometimes international
organizations paired with local groups, to contribute to the
programs, increasing resources available to the children.
</P>
<P>
   The agencies that get UNICEF grants work with local
organizations such as schools, interim care centers and skills
workshops. Whenever possible, de Burca urges the groups receiving
the grants to give the local groups materials instead of money,
which is harder to monitor. A woodworking training center, for
instance, might get lumber and tools rather than cash.
</P>
<P>
   Although inability to pay school fees prevents many children
from attending school, UNICEF tries not to give the former soldiers
money. That, de Burca said, would reward the former combatants.
Instead, the money is given to schools, such as St. Andrew's, which
then waive the fees.
</P>
<P>
   To demobilize the child soldiers, UNICEF has established
emergency care programs at four sites around the country. Children
who escape or have been released are given intensive psychological
counseling individually.
</P>
<P>
   These are children who have considered possibilities that no
child should have to envision. De Burca noticed writing on the
shoes of a 12-year-old boy and asked to see it. On the shoes, the
boy had written his name, his parents' names and the name of his
village.
</P>
<P>
   ``In case they killed me,'' he explained, ``I hoped somebody
would find me and tell my mother and father.''
</P>
<P>
   At the interim care facilities, the youngsters are told their
families will be traced. Then they are dispersed to programs in
their home areas.
</P>
<P>
   It will be four or five months before officials can tell whether
the Turner grant has helped children resume life in their villages,
de Burca said. ``But for demobilization, the money is making a
difference,'' she said. ``At any time of the day or night, soldiers
can be cared for.''
</P>
<P>
   Reintegration, though, can be difficult for children who have
pillaged and maimed.
</P>
<P>
   Aiah Bockarie, 16, feels so bad about what he's done that it
makes him sick.
</P>
<P>
   The first time he was ordered to sever someone's hand, he
refused; for that he was cut on the wrist with a bayonet. He still
bears the scar.
</P>
<P>
   After that, he complied. The first person whose hand he cut off
was his uncle. Other rebels forced the man's arm onto a slab of
cement.
</P>
<P>
   ``My uncle said, `You are my child! Why are you cutting off my
hand?''' Aiah recalled. ``And I replied, `I have an order to cut
off your hand.'''
</P>
<P>
   The rebels often forced children to commit crimes in their own
villages or against their families, international workers say. That
prevented them from returning home and turned the rebels into the
only family they had left.
</P>
<P>
   It was common, too, to deliberately addict child soldiers to
drugs. Aiah said he snorted powdered cocaine and applied crack
cocaine to cuts in his skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was rough. I was insane,'' he said. ``I cannot remember how
many hands I cut off, but I cut off many.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he is off drugs now. He wants to go to school and become
a doctor. He wants to pray. And he begs God's forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not necessary at the age of 16 to continue
destruction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to be a doctor, to heal people, but he still has
flashbacks about the things he did in the war.
</P>
<P>
   He is staying in Freetown as part of the program Children
Associated With the War, run by the Catholic Mission, which gets
Turner funding. He hasn't seen his family since he was kidnapped at
age 14. He has no idea how many survived the war, though he learned
his uncle was killed in an ambush the day Aiah cut off his hand.
</P>
<P>
   For all his prayers, Aiah radiates rage. That's common, said
Peter Francis, acting program manager for Children Associated With
the War.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are both the victims of atrocities and the
perpetrators,'' Francis said. ``They always have flashbacks. They
are very violent. The only difference is they do not have a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the center, he said, has had many successes _ children who
now are ``responsible people.''
</P>
<P>
   They get interim care for six months at the most. Counseling,
tracing the child's family and returning the child home are
critical. ``If you allow the child to just be hanging around the
neighborhood, you are creating more trouble,'' Francis said.
</P>
<P>
   But persuading the child's village to take him back requires
negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   Rituals must be performed to appease the gods and atone for
atrocities. The village chief may be presented with a goat, rice or
palm oil. If the chief accepts the child, so does the entire
community _ including the family.
</P>
<P>
   As Francis spoke, his boss, the Rev. Theophilus Momoh, returned
from a trip to outlying areas of the country. During that trip, he
returned 43 children to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   At first, his mission to bring ``rebel boys'' back was met with
resistance. But some parents were overjoyed. ``They said they
thought their children were dead,'' Momoh said. ``Some were really
happy. They started singing.''
</P>
<P>
   Momoh sometimes pays the head of the village a little money as a
token of sincerity and as a promise that he will respond if the
child creates trouble.
</P>
<P>
   A parent or relative signs an agreement accepting the return of
each child and pledges to try to put the child back in school.
Staffers of Children Associated With the War make follow-up visits
to assess the family's capacity to care for the child.
</P>
<P>
   Not all former combatants are boys. Aminata Turay was 15 when
rebels came into Koidu in Sierra Leone's diamond-rich eastern
region. Her father ordered the family inside, but the rebels
threatened to burn down the house unless he opened the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rebels entered the house and lined up my father, my
mother, myself, my younger brother and my two younger sisters,''
said Aminata, now 16. ``They took me and my brother out of the line
and told my father that they were taking us away with them. My
parents fell on the floor, weeping and begging them not to take us
away. They fired several shots on the ground in front of my parents
and threatened to kill them. So they took us away.''
</P>
<P>
   She lost track of her brother and was forced to march as the
rebels fought their way through village after village on the way to
Freetown. She did not kill, she said, but she helped burn houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rebel soldier who abducted me had made me his wife,'' she
said. ``He was forcing me to have sex with him at gunpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   She escaped when the rebels were routed from Freetown. She does
not know if her family is alive or dead.
</P>
<P>
   Mariama Jalloh's family survived, but getting her relatives to
take her back was difficult.
</P>
<P>
   She was kidnapped when she was 17. The first time a rebel tried
to rape her, she resisted. ``That's exactly why we abducted you,''
the rebel told her, ``so you could provide these services to me.''
</P>
<P>
   He threatened to kill her if she resisted. She had seen another
girl her age who had fought her rape vigorously. Rebels beat her
and branded ``RUF,'' for Revolutionary United Front, on her chest.
Then she was killed by a boy, perhaps 11, himself a kidnap victim.
</P>
<P>
   So Mariama submitted. She was raped ``every day,'' she said
softly, shaking her head. ``Every day. Every day.''
</P>
<P>
   She cried when she found out she was pregnant. She tried
traditional remedies, eating herbs and leaves, to terminate the
pregnancy, but they didn't work. Ill and depressed, she had to
march with the rebels as they burned their way toward Freetown.
Those who lagged were shot.
</P>
<P>
   After she escaped, she found that the rebels had burned her
father's house. He had lost everything. And here came his daughter,
pregnant with a rebel baby. He wanted nothing to do with her.
</P>
<P>
   Mariama worked intensively with a counselor whose fees were paid
with Turner money.
</P>
<P>
   ``She kept telling me there was life after that,'' Mariama said.
``It's not the end of the world, and the important thing is to have
the baby.''
</P>
<P>
   The baby is 5 months old now. Mariama named her Olayinka Maude
Jalloh, after her therapist.
</P>
<P>
   Her father still wants nothing to do with her. But, following
family mediation, Mariama is living with an aunt and uncle. Her
mother is caring for the baby. Mariama is back in the school she
attended before her capture.
</P>
<P>
   And she says she's going to be all right.
</P>
<P>
   Abibu Hawad, the 10-year-old who cut off more hands than he can
remember, is back living with his grandmother. His first-grade
teacher, Zainab Hassan, said the boy has shown no behavioral
problems and that she has made him prefect of the class.
</P>
<P>
   Still, neighborhood kids ``provoke'' him, Abibu said, and call
him a rebel child. And he feels guilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time I see an amputee, inside me I say to myself, `We are
the ones who did that,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes in his dreams the bad guys come back, tromp down his
stairs and issue him a gun.
</P>
<P>
   But the worst fears come when he is awake. Recently, news of
skirmishes between rebel factions in the northern part of the
country reached Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was worried that they would come and make me fight again,''
Abibu said. ``I thought I was going to be forced into another
war.''

appearance at the Florida Democratic convention, Bradley comes to
the gathering playing his outsider game. So far it appears to be
clicking for him in Iowa and New Hampshire but Bradley has spent
little time in the Sunshine State. Will he win them over and cause

   SIERRA _ FREETOWN, Sierra Leone _ They are children, some as
young as 9 years old. Most have been abducted, then forced to fight
in a bitter and brutal civil war. Boys have been made to shoot
people with AK-47s and to cut off the hands of civilians, sometimes
members of their own families. Girls have been forced to be the
``wives'' of rebel soldiers, being raped at gunpoint, as one
14-year-old said in an interview, ``every day, every day.''
Sometimes, once these children escape the rebel force, their
families do not want them back. We look at the ways in which money
donated by Atlanta media mogul Ted Turner, through the U.N.
Foundation, is trying to get these kids back in school, get them
psychological care, negotiate their ways back into their villages
and families, and let them be kids once more. (Melvin, Atlanta

 c.1999 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The televised ``debates'' now showing in America between the six
Republican candidates for president are not keeping anyone up at
night. Their format is unlively, with little cut-and-thrust allowed
among the men on the platform.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, something intriguing is emerging: the realization
that, in George W. Bush and John McCain, the two most-favored
candidates for New Hampshire, the Republicans are fielding two
opposite ideas of what an American president should be like.
</P>
<P>
   The strengths of the one are exactly the weaknesses of the
other, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   It starts with style, not to be underestimated in any American
election. Bush is all winks, jokes, flapping hands and puckish
grins. He exudes so much confidence, so much fun in the race, that
he seems light-headed. And this is alarming to many who watch him.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he really is a foolish fellow, afloat on too much money,
and with not even President Bill Clinton's quota of the seriousness
needed for the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is not unfunny himself _ he cracked the best joke of the
first debate, about his obsessive admiration for Alan Greenspan at
the Federal Reserve _ yet his campaign persona could hardly be more
different.
</P>
<P>
   He has the straight-backed stance of a soldier, a soldier's
directness of gaze: he does not hesitate to use words like
``heroism,'' ``honor'' and ``sacrifice.''
</P>
<P>
   Without necessarily reliving his prisoner-of-war years in
Vietnam, his speeches are suffused with that experience.
</P>
<P>
   He has so much gravitas of such an old-fashioned variety that
his audiences _ attuned, even in New Hampshire, to the fluff and
tinsel of modern campaigns _ can find his persona as disconcerting,
in its way, as the capers of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally enough, these different world-views translate into
very different approaches to foreign policy. Bush, famous now for
his failure to get places and names straight, still gives the
impression that foreign policy is alternately a game and a chore.
</P>
<P>
   His advisers have helped him to map out a path in which the
preservation of American sovereignty is uppermost (a popular
theme), and in which interventions abroad are kept to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   How different from McCain, who sees America as the preeminent
force for good in the world, and who thinks America should be
prepared not only to intervene when necessary, but to take
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Does all this suggest that McCain is The Economist's Republican?
Not necessarily, for in terms of domestic politics the strengths
tilt to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The front-runner has laid out detailed manifestoes for governing
that suggest a busy incrementalist: tending to fiscal incaution,
perhaps, but skeptical of government, sharp-eyed on social problems
and unafraid to experiment with such things as charter schools and
church-based welfare systems.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, McCain has linked most of his thinking about domestic
policy to the probably unattainable Holy Grail of campaign-finance
reform; and, unlike Bush, he has not prepared himself for the
presidency by running the country's second-biggest state.
</P>
<P>
   He has also not prepared himself by learning how to work with
others. Where Bush is famous for bringing Texas Democrats around to
his way of thinking, McCain is equally famous for having alienated,
both with temper and aloofness, his own colleagues in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   His penchant for plain speaking and maverick thinking
(refreshing, on its face, in a president) may be hazardous to his
political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   So too may be his stance as an ``outsider.'' Bush used to stress
his own outsider status, cowboy boots and all. But he has now put
that quietly aside in favor of being effective, and it does not
seem to have damaged him.
</P>
<P>
   Could the answer be a Bush-McCain ticket, Light and Heavy
together? Probably not, for McCain hardly has the self-effacing
emollience required of a vice-president.
</P>
<P>
   Americans _ and not a few foreigners _ can only regret that the
best parts of these two are not combined in a single candidate. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The televised ``debates'' now showing in America between the six
Republican candidates for president are not keeping anyone up at
night. Their format is unlively, with little cut-and-thrust allowed
among the men on the platform.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, something intriguing is emerging: the realization
that, in George W. Bush and John McCain, the two most-favored
candidates for New Hampshire, the Republicans are fielding two
opposite ideas of what an American president should be like.
</P>
<P>
   The strengths of the one are exactly the weaknesses of the
other, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   It starts with style, not to be underestimated in any American
election. Bush is all winks, jokes, flapping hands and puckish
grins. He exudes so much confidence, so much fun in the race, that
he seems light-headed. And this is alarming to many who watch him.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he really is a foolish fellow, afloat on too much money,
and with not even President Bill Clinton's quota of the seriousness
needed for the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is not unfunny himself _ he cracked the best joke of the
first debate, about his obsessive admiration for Alan Greenspan at
the Federal Reserve _ yet his campaign persona could hardly be more
different.
</P>
<P>
   He has the straight-backed stance of a soldier, a soldier's
directness of gaze: he does not hesitate to use words like
``heroism,'' ``honor'' and ``sacrifice.''
</P>
<P>
   Without necessarily reliving his prisoner-of-war years in
Vietnam, his speeches are suffused with that experience.
</P>
<P>
   He has so much gravitas of such an old-fashioned variety that
his audiences _ attuned, even in New Hampshire, to the fluff and
tinsel of modern campaigns _ can find his persona as disconcerting,
in its way, as the capers of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally enough, these different world-views translate into
very different approaches to foreign policy. Bush, famous now for
his failure to get places and names straight, still gives the
impression that foreign policy is alternately a game and a chore.
</P>
<P>
   His advisers have helped him to map out a path in which the
preservation of American sovereignty is uppermost (a popular
theme), and in which interventions abroad are kept to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   How different from McCain, who sees America as the preeminent
force for good in the world, and who thinks America should be
prepared not only to intervene when necessary, but to take
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Does all this suggest that McCain is The Economist's Republican?
Not necessarily, for in terms of domestic politics the strengths
tilt to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The front-runner has laid out detailed manifestoes for governing
that suggest a busy incrementalist: tending to fiscal incaution,
perhaps, but skeptical of government, sharp-eyed on social problems
and unafraid to experiment with such things as charter schools and
church-based welfare systems.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, McCain has linked most of his thinking about domestic
policy to the probably unattainable Holy Grail of campaign-finance
reform; and, unlike Bush, he has not prepared himself for the
presidency by running the country's second-biggest state.
</P>
<P>
   He has also not prepared himself by learning how to work with
others. Where Bush is famous for bringing Texas Democrats around to
his way of thinking, McCain is equally famous for having alienated,
both with temper and aloofness, his own colleagues in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   His penchant for plain speaking and maverick thinking
(refreshing, on its face, in a president) may be hazardous to his
political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   So too may be his stance as an ``outsider.'' Bush used to stress
his own outsider status, cowboy boots and all. But he has now put
that quietly aside in favor of being effective, and it does not
seem to have damaged him.
</P>
<P>
   Could the answer be a Bush-McCain ticket, Light and Heavy
together? Probably not, for McCain hardly has the self-effacing
emollience required of a vice-president.
</P>
<P>
   Americans _ and not a few foreigners _ can only regret that the
best parts of these two are not combined in a single candidate. &QL;

 c.1999 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the centuries economists have given warning of shortages of
food, fuel and almost every raw material. They were almost always
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, The Economist would like to draw attention to a new
shortage: of acronyms and abbreviations.
</P>
<P>
   So great is the demand in a world where new organizations spring
up almost daily, and firms are increasingly known only by strings
of initials, that there are simply not enough to go around.
</P>
<P>
   Take the WTO _ the World Trade Organization, not the World
Tourism Organization, which was set up well before the free-traders
pinched its initials.
</P>
<P>
   Readers of The Economist know that the meeting in Seattle was
supposedly about opening markets to international trade. But
perhaps, as a commentator in Barrons suggests, the Internet had
been rife with rumor that the meeting was a gathering of
representatives of the World Temperance Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The chanting and the street demos were really a laudable _ and
wholly proportionate _ protest by trade unionists, greens,
turtle-lovers and anarchists against what they feared would be a
global ban on alcohol. History will remember the ``Bottle of
Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Or look at the International Monetary Fund, which, for all its
preaching to the Third World, believes in monopolies when it suits
its purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The Fund is suing a Californian mortgage firm, IMF Loans (an
abbreviation of Iron Mountain Financial, based on a direct
translation of the owner's German maiden name), to force it to
change its name, which it claims is misleading _ though Russia has
not yet come knocking on the mortgage lender's door.
</P>
<P>
   How long before the Washington-based IMF takes on Britain's
International Managers' Forum, the Indian Mountaineering
Foundation, or the Integrated Microscopy Facility (at Southwest
Texas State University)?
</P>
<P>
   Confusion abounds. Americans visiting Britain this summer were
puzzled by demonstrators brandishing placards demanding that the
government ``ban GM.''
</P>
<P>
   Are cars built by General Motors really so unreliable? No, the
villain was genetically modified foods.
</P>
<P>
   A headline ``ECB raises rates'' could cause turmoil in financial
markets. Yet rather than tighter monetary policy at the European
Central Bank it might refer to the England Cricket Board increasing
membership fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turmoil at the LSE'' might signify a market crash on the
London Stock Exchange or a staff walkout at the London School of
Economics.
</P>
<P>
   And if a fellow traveller remarks that he is with the CIA, don't
be alarmed. As a member of the Canadian Institute of Actuaries,
that bulge is more likely to be a calculator than a gun.
</P>
<P>
   The nasty truth is that there are only 17,576 different
permutations of three letters. That is not enough, when a
multinational organization such as the ECB requires no fewer than
five sets of abbreviations in the languages of the EU. Add one more
letter and the permutations number almost 457,000.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even this does not solve the dilemma. Is the CBOT the
Chicago Board of Trade or the Central Bank of Turkey?
</P>
<P>
   This is a clear market failure. In the market for cabbages or
computers, prices would rise, encouraging greater supply or choking
off demand. But the supply of abbreviations is fixed _ and the
price is stuck at zero.
</P>
<P>
   Demand cannot be satisfied. Yet multiple use of an abbreviation
only creates confusion. The solution is simple.
</P>
<P>
   A new organization is needed to tax and control the
proliferation of initials. It might be called AAAAAA (the
Association for the Alleviation of Absurd Acronyms and Asinine

<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the centuries economists have given warning of shortages of
food, fuel and almost every raw material. They were almost always
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, The Economist would like to draw attention to a new
shortage: of acronyms and abbreviations.
</P>
<P>
   So great is the demand in a world where new organizations spring
up almost daily, and firms are increasingly known only by strings
of initials, that there are simply not enough to go around.
</P>
<P>
   Take the WTO _ the World Trade Organization, not the World
Tourism Organization, which was set up well before the free-traders
pinched its initials.
</P>
<P>
   Readers of The Economist know that the meeting in Seattle was
supposedly about opening markets to international trade. But
perhaps, as a commentator in Barrons suggests, the Internet had
been rife with rumor that the meeting was a gathering of
representatives of the World Temperance Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The chanting and the street demos were really a laudable _ and
wholly proportionate _ protest by trade unionists, greens,
turtle-lovers and anarchists against what they feared would be a
global ban on alcohol. History will remember the ``Bottle of
Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Or look at the International Monetary Fund, which, for all its
preaching to the Third World, believes in monopolies when it suits
its purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The Fund is suing a Californian mortgage firm, IMF Loans (an
abbreviation of Iron Mountain Financial, based on a direct
translation of the owner's German maiden name), to force it to
change its name, which it claims is misleading _ though Russia has
not yet come knocking on the mortgage lender's door.
</P>
<P>
   How long before the Washington-based IMF takes on Britain's
International Managers' Forum, the Indian Mountaineering
Foundation, or the Integrated Microscopy Facility (at Southwest
Texas State University)?
</P>
<P>
   Confusion abounds. Americans visiting Britain this summer were
puzzled by demonstrators brandishing placards demanding that the
government ``ban GM.''
</P>
<P>
   Are cars built by General Motors really so unreliable? No, the
villain was genetically modified foods.
</P>
<P>
   A headline ``ECB raises rates'' could cause turmoil in financial
markets. Yet rather than tighter monetary policy at the European
Central Bank it might refer to the England Cricket Board increasing
membership fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turmoil at the LSE'' might signify a market crash on the
London Stock Exchange or a staff walkout at the London School of
Economics.
</P>
<P>
   And if a fellow traveller remarks that he is with the CIA, don't
be alarmed. As a member of the Canadian Institute of Actuaries,
that bulge is more likely to be a calculator than a gun.
</P>
<P>
   The nasty truth is that there are only 17,576 different
permutations of three letters. That is not enough, when a
multinational organization such as the ECB requires no fewer than
five sets of abbreviations in the languages of the EU. Add one more
letter and the permutations number almost 457,000.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even this does not solve the dilemma. Is the CBOT the
Chicago Board of Trade or the Central Bank of Turkey?
</P>
<P>
   This is a clear market failure. In the market for cabbages or
computers, prices would rise, encouraging greater supply or choking
off demand. But the supply of abbreviations is fixed _ and the
price is stuck at zero.
</P>
<P>
   Demand cannot be satisfied. Yet multiple use of an abbreviation
only creates confusion. The solution is simple.
</P>
<P>
   A new organization is needed to tax and control the
proliferation of initials. It might be called AAAAAA (the
Association for the Alleviation of Absurd Acronyms and Asinine
Abbreviations). &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Internet has come of age in this presidential
campaign. Every candidate has his sophisticated Web site, and sets
great store by it.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the hangers-on, who set up Web sites either to
support a candidate or, more often, to ridicule him?
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush knows what should happen to the latter: they
should be squashed.
</P>
<P>
   He has been suffering from the attentions of www.gwbush.com, a
spoof site with an official-looking photograph of Bush that proves,
on closer inspection, to feature a straw stuck up the governor's
nose.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has sent a cease-and-desist letter to the site's creator,
Zack Exley, accusing him of using pictures ``borrowed'' from his
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   He has also complained to the Federal Election Commission (FEC)
that the site constitutes ``express advocacy,'' and violates the
Federal Election Campaign Act's spending limits and registration
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The FEC _ the ``Failure to Enforce Commission,'' its critics
call it _ is unsure what to do about this. It is seeking public
comment over the next two months on how election law should apply
to sites like Exley's, and indeed how it applies to the Internet in
general.
</P>
<P>
   It is a large problem. One voter in every ten surfs the Net to
find advice on how to vote. Lobbyists bombard Congress with
electronic messages: the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sent
over 200,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians raise big sums online (Bill Bradley has just passed
$1 million). And from RunHillary.com to AlBore.com, Web sites laud
and lampoon nearly every candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The FEC says it is ``unquestionable'' that federal election law
applies to activity on the Internet. Critics such as the ACLU
disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Political speech deserves the highest protection of the First
Amendment and should only be regulated if there's a threat of
corruption,'' says Laura Murphy, director of the organization's
office in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FEC has yet to demonstrate how this new Web technology
could have a corrupting influence on the political process.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet an exceptionally large e-mail Christmas card list, or a
highly-visited Web site, may be so influential _ and even so
corrupting _ that it could draw the FEC's attention.
</P>
<P>
   Others say money should be the criterion for FEC involvement. If
people are not spending much money on their advocacy, they should
stay unregulated. Yet on the Internet, partisans can build Web
sites and send thousands of e-mails at a tiny cost.
</P>
<P>
   David Mason, one of the FEC's six commissioners, said recently
that the FEC would take a relatively permissive approach to
Internet activity, exempting most private political speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my view,'' he said, ``that someone who is operating on
their own would be covered by an exemption in the act which applies
to voluntary activity.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand (considerable confusion here), ``the volunteer
exemption applies to someone who is volunteering on behalf of the
campaign, and if you're out there on your own you may not be
covered.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears, then, that the exemption may not cover volunteers
who are truly independent of the candidates they support. Take the
case of Noah Heller, a 19-year-old freshman student and co-owner of
NetizensForBradley.org.
</P>
<P>
   Heller has deliberately had no contact with the Bradley
campaign, to avoid being labelled an in-kind contribution. Yet, by
obeying the letter of the law, he is truly ``on his own,'' and
possibly not covered by the volunteer exemption.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the question of Web sites that generate revenue.
``When you start taking money from somebody for what you're doing,
that is a different sort of thing than volunteer activity in your
home,'' says Mason.
</P>
<P>
   But many personal Web sites, having almost no money behind them,
try to offset costs with banner ads and other e-commerce. Exley,
for example, sells T-shirts and bumper stickers on gwbush.com to
help maintain the site.
</P>
<P>
   He has also been soliciting online donations to create
television and e-commercials critical of Bush (he raised $2,500 in
only five days). But the ads may very likely draw the FEC's
attention. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 200 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 700) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A case last year gave some guidance on how the FEC might treat
Web sites that do not merit a volunteer exemption.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Smith, a tax consultant in Connecticut, built a personal Web
site advocating the defeat of a local congresswoman, Nancy Johnson.
The FEC said the site constituted ``express advocacy'' that would
trigger an independent-expenditure reporting requirement if its
value rose above $250.
</P>
<P>
   However, if Smith coordinated his activities with Johnson's
official opponent, it would become an ``in-kind'' contribution that
could not exceed $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   But how would the FEC put a value on the site? The commission
said it would add the fee for registering the domain name
(typically $70) to the overhead costs of the computer hardware and
software (these could easily be over $1,000) and Internet services
(perhaps $240 a year), then divide that sum by the total number of
Web sites Smith maintained.
</P>
<P>
   Such a formula could push most Web sites over the legal
threshold. But the more an individual used the Internet to
influence politics, the more likely he would be to avoid
regulation, as total expenses (which are fixed) would be divided by
a greater number of sites. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The finances of Web sites are often mysterious even to their
creators. At NetizensForBradley.org, Greg Laynor, one of the site's
founders (who also happens to be 14, and at school), explains that
dozens of volunteers work on the site, but that they have not
spoken to each other. They communicate only by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Even Greg and Heller, the other founder of the site, have never
spoken. There is no way for them to know what money the collective
has spent on maintaining the site, and therefore whether they have
passed the spending limits. And it is possible that the FEC might
count the hardware and software costs of the volunteers. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,025) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hyperlinks (a word, phrase or image on a Web page that, when
clicked, sends you elsewhere) are also tricky.
</P>
<P>
   Mason says hyperlinks on personal Web sites should be exempt,
and those on commercial sites regulated. But, again, everything
depends on value; and how should hyperlinks be valued, when they
can be created in seconds at no marginal cost, and are often paid
for by barter (you link to me, I link to you)? &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,400) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is also hard to see how anyone could spend $250 _ the limit
for unreported independent expenditure _ on forwarding e-mails. But
Mason says that e-mail lists of a certain size, even if they did
not surpass spending limits, may require regulation.
</P>
<P>
   When does an e-mail list, or a Web site, get too large or
influential? Even a handful of e-mails can have a disproportionate
impact. In 1996, the Children's Defense Fund's 2,000 e-mail
subscribers regularly forwarded alerts to another 200,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   And a high-profile complaint can propel a previously obscure Web
site to fame, attracting the eye of the regulators. (Visitors to
gwbush.com soared from 30 to around 500,000 a month after Bush
filed his complaint.)
</P>
<P>
   How will the FEC know when such a nebulous line is crossed, and,
more important, how will the Internet advocates know?
</P>
<P>
   Roger Stone, a former election lawyer who is director of
political advocacy for Juno Online Services, says the rules are now
so confusing that ``even lawyers call specialists.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of NetizensForBradley.org, the specialist is the
young Greg Laynor, who has read all the FEC literature but still
concludes that ``it's not clear if we're doing something wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone says the commission must tailor its rules to non-lawyers
like Greg, lest frustrated netizens ``ignore the law and act at
their peril, or throw up their hands and decide it's not worth
becoming politically involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The beginnings of a chill are already in the air. At the end of
November Mason complained that the FEC had received only 24 e-mails
during the first two weeks of public comment. And at least one big
political Web site said it would not submit comments for fear of
attracting the regulators' attention. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Mason says hyperlinks on personal Web sites should be exempt,
and those on commercial sites regulated. But, again, everything
depends on value; and how should hyperlinks be valued, when they
can be created in seconds at no marginal cost, and are often paid
for by barter (you link to me, I link to you)? &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,400) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is also hard to see how anyone could spend $250 _ the limit
for unreported independent expenditure _ on forwarding e-mails. But
Mason says that e-mail lists of a certain size, even if they did
not surpass spending limits, may require regulation.
</P>
<P>
   When does an e-mail list, or a Web site, get too large or
influential? Even a handful of e-mails can have a disproportionate
impact. In 1996, the Children's Defense Fund's 2,000 e-mail
subscribers regularly forwarded alerts to another 200,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   And a high-profile complaint can propel a previously obscure Web
site to fame, attracting the eye of the regulators. (Visitors to
gwbush.com soared from 30 to around 500,000 a month after Bush
filed his complaint.)
</P>
<P>
   How will the FEC know when such a nebulous line is crossed, and,
more important, how will the Internet advocates know?
</P>
<P>
   Roger Stone, a former election lawyer who is director of
political advocacy for Juno Online Services, says the rules are now
so confusing that ``even lawyers call specialists.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of NetizensForBradley.org, the specialist is the
young Greg Laynor, who has read all the FEC literature but still
concludes that ``it's not clear if we're doing something wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone says the commission must tailor its rules to non-lawyers
like Greg, lest frustrated netizens ``ignore the law and act at
their peril, or throw up their hands and decide it's not worth
becoming politically involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The beginnings of a chill are already in the air. At the end of
November Mason complained that the FEC had received only 24 e-mails
during the first two weeks of public comment. And at least one big
political Web site said it would not submit comments for fear of
attracting the regulators' attention. &QL;

NBC IS IN COMMAND OF SUNDAY MORNING TALK SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the campaign for the presidential election of 2000
gears up, so does the race among the Sunday morning political
discussion programs on television. And this race has a clear
front-runner: NBC's ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   In almost a direct reversal of the competitive status of the
Sunday programs in the last two presidential election years, ``Meet
The Press'' is now the definitive, dominant leader, while ABC's
``This Week,'' once the hottest show, has slid backward. It is now
being challenged for second place in the ratings by ``Face The
Nation'' on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   While their overall number of viewers is not large, the Sunday
talk programs are considered extremely important inside the network
news divisions and network corporate offices. As Andrew Heyward,
the president of CBS News, put it, ``they are terribly important
aspects of a news division's presence in Washington. They are
furiously competitive in terms of booking guests. And, frankly,
there is a lot of money to be made on them.''
</P>
<P>
   In election years, the programs take on importance even beyond
their profit figures. Booking candidates and having them make news
on the programs becomes a primary goal. The ratings edge of ``Meet
The Press'' is clearly an advantage in booking guests, network
executives said.
</P>
<P>
   One indication is next Sunday's scheduled joint appearance by Al
Gore and Bill Bradley on ``Meet The Press,'' in what its moderator,
Tim Russert, calls ``as close to the Lincoln-Douglas debate format
as we're likely to see in this campaign.'' ABC notes that it has
both those candidates on ``Nightline'' on Thursday in a town
meeting format.
</P>
<P>
   Network executives cited numerous reasons for NBC's success, but
they mainly focused on the addition of one personality, Russert, to
``Meet the Press'' and the subtraction of another, David Brinkley,
from ``This Week.''
</P>
<P>
   Russert is widely credited with reinventing the venerable (it is
52 years old) ``Meet The Press,'' changing it from a sleepy
encounter between reporters and Washington newsmakers into a taut,
in-depth, issue-dense interview program that usually pits the
bulldog style of Russert against the newsmaker of the week.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's ``This Week,'' meanwhile, is widely described as having
drifted since the departure of Brinkley in 1997 _ though Russert
was nosing ahead even before then. ABC's formerly heralded
``roundtable discussion'' _ now including the well-known political
reporters Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts, and the commentators
George Will, George Stephanopoulos and William Kristol _ has
apparently lost some of its appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In the November sweeps, ``Meet the Press'' scored a 3.4 rating
to a 2.4 for ABC and a 2.1 for CBS. (Each rating point represents
just over 1 million homes.) More ominously for ABC, CBS' program
beat or tied ``This Week'' among viewers between 18 and 49, the
category that matters most to advertisers on news programs.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most telling statistic is where the programs have
moved since November 1991. At that time, ``This Week'' had 3.9
million viewers. ``Face The Nation'' had 2.85 million, and ``Meet
the Press,'' 2.81 millions. This November the numbers were: ``Meet
The Press,'' 4.1 million viewers, or a 46 percent increase; ``This
Week,'' 2.8 million viewers, down 27 percent; and ``Face the
Nation,'' 2.5 million, down 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Two other competitors, ``Fox News Sunday'' and ``Late Edition''
on CNN, have smaller numbers of viewers but have also become
factors in the competition, both showing some growth in total
viewers over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   While executives at NBC, ABC and CBS describe their programs as
profitable, NBC has usurped the position of leader in terms of
profits. One industry executive said that NBC was making about $40
million in annual profit on ``Meet The Press,'' much more than its
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The competitiveness of an election year is one reason why David
Westin, the president of ABC News, wants ``This Week'' to make
significant changes by the end of the month. ``We are not at all
where we need to be with the show,'' Westin said of ``This Week.''
``Improving the bookings and the focus of the show are the things
we need to do. I want to see us come out of the box in January with
something different.''
</P>
<P>
   Something different might start with some way to separate the
program more convincingly from its past. The program became so
associated with David Brinkley that more than two years after his
departure, ``This Week'' is routinely referred to inside ABC News
as the Brinkley show.
</P>
<P>
   Under Brinkley, ``This Week'' became the first Sunday program to
expand to an hour. From its start in 1981, it towered over the
competition, until Russert arrived in December 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to take advantage of the election of 1992, he asked NBC
to temporarily expand ``Meet the Press'' to an hour. The program,
reformatted to emphasize Russert's one-on-one interviews, quickly
made news that year, especially in interviews with Gore and Ross
Perot.
</P>
<P>
   Now his interviews are considered something of a watershed
challenge for candidates. When Bush decided to sit down with
Russert, it became a widely reported part of his campaign coverage
that he had managed to get through the interview without seriously
stumbling.
</P>
<P>
   The panel section of the program has been reduced under Russert.
Some competitors have suggested that this reflects Russert's desire
to make ``Meet the Press'' more the Tim Russert show. Russert said
he shifted from the panel questioning both to give the program more
flexibility (he has gone as long as 27 minutes without a
commercial) and because contemporary candidates are so
sophisticated and good at managing the media that only a totally
focused interview can ``get through all the gobbledygook.''
</P>
<P>
   Heyward of CBS News said that Russert's style works because ``he
is very clearly seen as the audience's surrogate, not as an
ideologue.''
</P>
<P>
   He argued that CBS' anchor for ``Face The Nation,'' Bob
Schieffer, was similarly regarded. Heyward added, ``Look at the way
Russert looks. He looks like Everyman.''
</P>
<P>
   But some Clinton administration figures felt that Russert's
personal views took over during his pursuit of the Monica Lewinsky
episode, saying he was openly hostile. Russert said he had been
fair, noting that he took on Clinton enemies like Rep. Dan Burton,
R-Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, Westin said he believed that the Lewinsky
coverage had badly damaged ``This Week.'' ``We have five people on
the show who more or less came out in the same place,'' he said.
``When you have a story that goes on for over a year, that gets
tedious after a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he intends to remake ``This Week'' more in the image of
``Meet The Press,'' Westin said more one-on-one interviews were
likely. Asked if the program might shift to a single main anchor,
he said, ``There is not any plan to go to that in the near
future.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Internet has come of age in this presidential
campaign. Every candidate has his sophisticated Web site, and sets
great store by it.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the hangers-on, who set up Web sites either to
support a candidate or, more often, to ridicule him?
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush knows what should happen to the latter: they
should be squashed.
</P>
<P>
   He has been suffering from the attentions of www.gwbush.com, a
spoof site with an official-looking photograph of Bush that proves,
on closer inspection, to feature a straw stuck up the governor's
nose.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has sent a cease-and-desist letter to the site's creator,
Zack Exley, accusing him of using pictures ``borrowed'' from his
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   He has also complained to the Federal Election Commission (FEC)
that the site constitutes ``express advocacy,'' and violates the
Federal Election Campaign Act's spending limits and registration
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The FEC _ the ``Failure to Enforce Commission,'' its critics
call it _ is unsure what to do about this. It is seeking public
comment over the next two months on how election law should apply
to sites like Exley's, and indeed how it applies to the Internet in
general.
</P>
<P>
   It is a large problem. One voter in every ten surfs the Net to
find advice on how to vote. Lobbyists bombard Congress with
electronic messages: the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sent
over 200,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians raise big sums online (Bill Bradley has just passed
$1 million). And from RunHillary.com to AlBore.com, Web sites laud
and lampoon nearly every candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The FEC says it is ``unquestionable'' that federal election law
applies to activity on the Internet. Critics such as the ACLU
disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Political speech deserves the highest protection of the First
Amendment and should only be regulated if there's a threat of
corruption,'' says Laura Murphy, director of the organization's
office in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FEC has yet to demonstrate how this new Web technology
could have a corrupting influence on the political process.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet an exceptionally large e-mail Christmas card list, or a
highly-visited Web site, may be so influential _ and even so
corrupting _ that it could draw the FEC's attention.
</P>
<P>
   Others say money should be the criterion for FEC involvement. If
people are not spending much money on their advocacy, they should
stay unregulated. Yet on the Internet, partisans can build Web
sites and send thousands of e-mails at a tiny cost.
</P>
<P>
   David Mason, one of the FEC's six commissioners, said recently
that the FEC would take a relatively permissive approach to
Internet activity, exempting most private political speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my view,'' he said, ``that someone who is operating on
their own would be covered by an exemption in the act which applies
to voluntary activity.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand (considerable confusion here), ``the volunteer
exemption applies to someone who is volunteering on behalf of the
campaign, and if you're out there on your own you may not be
covered.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears, then, that the exemption may not cover volunteers
who are truly independent of the candidates they support. Take the
case of Noah Heller, a 19-year-old freshman student and co-owner of
NetizensForBradley.org.
</P>
<P>
   Heller has deliberately had no contact with the Bradley
campaign, to avoid being labelled an in-kind contribution. Yet, by
obeying the letter of the law, he is truly ``on his own,'' and
possibly not covered by the volunteer exemption.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the question of Web sites that generate revenue.
``When you start taking money from somebody for what you're doing,
that is a different sort of thing than volunteer activity in your
home,'' says Mason.
</P>
<P>
   But many personal Web sites, having almost no money behind them,
try to offset costs with banner ads and other e-commerce. Exley,
for example, sells T-shirts and bumper stickers on gwbush.com to
help maintain the site.
</P>
<P>
   He has also been soliciting online donations to create
television and e-commercials critical of Bush (he raised $2,500 in
only five days). But the ads may very likely draw the FEC's
attention. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 200 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 700) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A case last year gave some guidance on how the FEC might treat
Web sites that do not merit a volunteer exemption.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Smith, a tax consultant in Connecticut, built a personal Web
site advocating the defeat of a local congresswoman, Nancy Johnson.
The FEC said the site constituted ``express advocacy'' that would
trigger an independent-expenditure reporting requirement if its
value rose above $250.
</P>
<P>
   However, if Smith coordinated his activities with Johnson's
official opponent, it would become an ``in-kind'' contribution that
could not exceed $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   But how would the FEC put a value on the site? The commission
said it would add the fee for registering the domain name
(typically $70) to the overhead costs of the computer hardware and
software (these could easily be over $1,000) and Internet services
(perhaps $240 a year), then divide that sum by the total number of
Web sites Smith maintained.
</P>
<P>
   Such a formula could push most Web sites over the legal
threshold. But the more an individual used the Internet to
influence politics, the more likely he would be to avoid
regulation, as total expenses (which are fixed) would be divided by
a greater number of sites. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The finances of Web sites are often mysterious even to their
creators. At NetizensForBradley.org, Greg Laynor, one of the site's
founders (who also happens to be 14, and at school), explains that
dozens of volunteers work on the site, but that they have not
spoken to each other. They communicate only by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Even Greg and Heller, the other founder of the site, have never
spoken. There is no way for them to know what money the collective
has spent on maintaining the site, and therefore whether they have
passed the spending limits. And it is possible that the FEC might
count the hardware and software costs of the volunteers. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,025) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hyperlinks (a word, phrase or image on a Web page that, when
clicked, sends you elsewhere) are also tricky.
</P>
<P>
   Mason says hyperlinks on personal Web sites should be exempt,
and those on commercial sites regulated. But, again, everything

   David Mason, one of the FEC's six commissioners, said recently
that the FEC would take a relatively permissive approach to
Internet activity, exempting most private political speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my view,'' he said, ``that someone who is operating on
their own would be covered by an exemption in the act which applies
to voluntary activity.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand (considerable confusion here), ``the volunteer
exemption applies to someone who is volunteering on behalf of the
campaign, and if you're out there on your own you may not be
covered.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears, then, that the exemption may not cover volunteers
who are truly independent of the candidates they support. Take the
case of Noah Heller, a 19-year-old freshman student and co-owner of
NetizensForBradley.org.
</P>
<P>
   Heller has deliberately had no contact with the Bradley
campaign, to avoid being labelled an in-kind contribution. Yet, by
obeying the letter of the law, he is truly ``on his own,'' and
possibly not covered by the volunteer exemption.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the question of Web sites that generate revenue.
``When you start taking money from somebody for what you're doing,
that is a different sort of thing than volunteer activity in your
home,'' says Mason.
</P>
<P>
   But many personal Web sites, having almost no money behind them,
try to offset costs with banner ads and other e-commerce. Exley,
for example, sells T-shirts and bumper stickers on gwbush.com to
help maintain the site.
</P>
<P>
   He has also been soliciting online donations to create
television and e-commercials critical of Bush (he raised $2,500 in
only five days). But the ads may very likely draw the FEC's
attention. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 200 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 700) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A case last year gave some guidance on how the FEC might treat
Web sites that do not merit a volunteer exemption.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Smith, a tax consultant in Connecticut, built a personal Web
site advocating the defeat of a local congresswoman, Nancy Johnson.
The FEC said the site constituted ``express advocacy'' that would
trigger an independent-expenditure reporting requirement if its
value rose above $250.
</P>
<P>
   However, if Smith coordinated his activities with Johnson's
official opponent, it would become an ``in-kind'' contribution that
could not exceed $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   But how would the FEC put a value on the site? The commission
said it would add the fee for registering the domain name
(typically $70) to the overhead costs of the computer hardware and
software (these could easily be over $1,000) and Internet services
(perhaps $240 a year), then divide that sum by the total number of
Web sites Smith maintained.
</P>
<P>
   Such a formula could push most Web sites over the legal
threshold. But the more an individual used the Internet to
influence politics, the more likely he would be to avoid
regulation, as total expenses (which are fixed) would be divided by
a greater number of sites. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The finances of Web sites are often mysterious even to their
creators. At NetizensForBradley.org, Greg Laynor, one of the site's
founders (who also happens to be 14, and at school), explains that
dozens of volunteers work on the site, but that they have not
spoken to each other. They communicate only by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Even Greg and Heller, the other founder of the site, have never
spoken. There is no way for them to know what money the collective
has spent on maintaining the site, and therefore whether they have
passed the spending limits. And it is possible that the FEC might
count the hardware and software costs of the volunteers. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,025) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hyperlinks (a word, phrase or image on a Web page that, when
clicked, sends you elsewhere) are also tricky.
</P>
<P>
   Mason says hyperlinks on personal Web sites should be exempt,
and those on commercial sites regulated. But, again, everything
depends on value; and how should hyperlinks be valued, when they
can be created in seconds at no marginal cost, and are often paid
for by barter (you link to me, I link to you)? &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,400) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is also hard to see how anyone could spend $250 _ the limit
for unreported independent expenditure _ on forwarding e-mails. But
Mason says that e-mail lists of a certain size, even if they did
not surpass spending limits, may require regulation.
</P>
<P>
   When does an e-mail list, or a Web site, get too large or
influential? Even a handful of e-mails can have a disproportionate
impact. In 1996, the Children's Defense Fund's 2,000 e-mail
subscribers regularly forwarded alerts to another 200,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   And a high-profile complaint can propel a previously obscure Web
site to fame, attracting the eye of the regulators. (Visitors to
gwbush.com soared from 30 to around 500,000 a month after Bush
filed his complaint.)
</P>
<P>
   How will the FEC know when such a nebulous line is crossed, and,
more important, how will the Internet advocates know?
</P>
<P>
   Roger Stone, a former election lawyer who is director of
political advocacy for Juno Online Services, says the rules are now
so confusing that ``even lawyers call specialists.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of NetizensForBradley.org, the specialist is the
young Greg Laynor, who has read all the FEC literature but still
concludes that ``it's not clear if we're doing something wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone says the commission must tailor its rules to non-lawyers
like Greg, lest frustrated netizens ``ignore the law and act at
their peril, or throw up their hands and decide it's not worth
becoming politically involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The beginnings of a chill are already in the air. At the end of
November Mason complained that the FEC had received only 24 e-mails
during the first two weeks of public comment. And at least one big
political Web site said it would not submit comments for fear of
attracting the regulators' attention. &QL;

   ``You have the right to remain silent. If you give up the right
to remain silent, anything you say can and will be used against you
in a court of law. You have the right to a lawyer and to have a
lawyer present during questioning. If you would like a lawyer but
cannot afford one, a lawyer will be appointed for you without
charge. Do you understand?''
</P>
<P>
   Familiar, and widely admired, phrases. Intoned in thousands of
American films and television shows, the formula is known
throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   For most Americans, the so-called Miranda warning _ named after
a case that came before the Supreme Court in 1966, and daily read
to tens of thousands of arrested people _ is a reassuring symbol
that their criminal justice system, warts and all, is fundamentally
fair.
</P>
<P>
   The court's ruling requires the warning _ or a version of it,
the exact words varying from state to state _ to be read to any
arrested person before he or she is interrogated.
</P>
<P>
   Well, think again: or so it will be argued before the Supreme
Court early next year.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 6 the court agreed to examine a lower-court ruling which
found that the Miranda warning is not, as had been thought,
required by the American Constitution and that it had, in effect,
been overruled by a long-dormant federal law enacted in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   The case before the court has a curious, and revealing, history.
Unlike nearly all others, it is not the result of a genuine legal
dispute but of a political campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side in the current case _ Charles Dickerson, a bank
robber, or his federal prosecutors _ asked the Fourth Circuit
federal appeals court, based in Richmond, Va., to rule on the
validity of Miranda warnings.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless that court, one of the most vigorously conservative
in the country, took up the issue at the prompting of Paul Cassell,
a law professor at the University of Utah, who has waged a lonely
campaign against the Miranda decision in law journals and court
briefs.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court, almost as unusually, has asked Cassell to
defend the Fourth Circuit's decision. Cassell is a former law clerk
to Antonin Scalia, the Supreme Court's leading conservative, who
has already expressed his skepticism about Miranda.
</P>
<P>
   Cassell has long argued that every year Miranda warnings help
thousands of criminals to escape prosecution. This was precisely
the fear of those who criticized Miranda when it was announced by a
divided Supreme Court 33 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The court's five-to-four decision, based on the right against
self-incrimination laid down in the Constitution's Fifth Amendment,
was a high-water mark of the liberal court presided over by Chief
Justice Earl Warren. It immediately became the target of
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1968 presidential election, Richard Nixon attacked the
decision, and in the same year conservative senators pushed Lyndon
Johnson, who then occupied the White House, into accepting a
provision supposedly overruling Miranda as the price for passing a
big crime bill.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the worst fears of the critics and of the police have
not been realized. Despite Cassell's claims, there is little
evidence that a significant number of guilty people are going free
because of the Miranda warning.
</P>
<P>
   The chief reason for this is that, contrary to expectations,
most people under arrest do not keep their mouths shut and do not
ask for a lawyer, even though it is almost always in their interest
to do so. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (225-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 575) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One study even claimed that the rate of confessions had risen by
9.8 percent since the warning was introduced. Most other studies
show that the confession rate has at least not fallen.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two-thirds of those arrested proceed to make a
confession. Moreover, the warning has not proved quite the bulwark
against coerced confessions and self-incrimination that the Warren
court had intended.
</P>
<P>
   Some policemen have found ways to dilute its effect _ by reading
it in an incomprehensible monotone, by cozying up to suspects
before reciting it, or by delaying access to a lawyer even when one
is requested.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court itself has chipped away at its effectiveness
in a series of subsequent cases.
</P>
<P>
   For example, although the original 1966 decision explicitly
required that all questioning cease once a suspect had asked for a
lawyer or invoked his right to remain silent, the court has allowed
evidence extracted from suspects after they have invoked their
right to be used in court against them if they do go ahead and
testify.
</P>
<P>
   Information gleaned in this way can also be used to dig up other
incriminating evidence. Civil-liberties campaigners are suing
police forces in Los Angeles and Santa Monica for routinely
continuing interrogations after the Miranda rights have been
invoked. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 225-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,050) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If it has not been as effective as was hoped, is Miranda worth
keeping? Most of those concerned with defendants' rights believe it
is.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an important symbol,'' argues David Cole, a law professor
at Georgetown University in Washington. ``It's the only example of
the court trying to offset with a clear rule the economic
inequalities which make the criminal justice system unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   If arrested, says Cole, ``rich people will always have their
attorneys there to advise them. Poor people almost never will.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some law-enforcement groups are expected to file briefs
supporting Cassell, more will probably oppose him.
</P>
<P>
   Most of America's policemen are now comfortable with Miranda,
and many prosecutors argue that they have more to lose than to gain
by a return to pre-Miranda days, which is what a victory for
Cassell would mean.
</P>
<P>
   Courts rarely inquire into the voluntariness of a confession
given after a Miranda warning. Without the warning, the police
would have to prove, case by case, that a disputed confession was
voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   This is why no administration has tried to resurrect the 1968
law that seemed to overturn Miranda: that law, rather than the
court's 1966 decision, has been regarded as unconstitutional, and
therefore empty.
</P>
<P>
   It will be extraordinary if the Supreme Court, after reaffirming
the Miranda decision in dozens of cases over the past 33 years,
changes its mind next year. &QL;

   He is one of the most successful Republican politicians and a
possible running-mate for George W. Bush, if (as expected) George
W. triumphs.
</P>
<P>
   It is something of an indictment of the party that few outside
his home state have heard of him. But then Tom Ridge, the governor
of Pennsylvania, is an unusual sort of Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining why shows how much the party is changing. Ridge comes
of a working-class family from the steel mills of Erie, Penn. He
went to Harvard. He served as a sergeant in Vietnam (returning to
become the first non-commissioned Vietnam veteran in Congress).
</P>
<P>
   This is not a combination you often see. His politics also makes
nonsense of the conventional wisdom that says there are only two
sorts of Republicans: abrasive social conservatives and
laisser-faire economic ones.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge fits into neither camp. He is no social conservative, at
least according to the abortion test. Catholic though he is, he has
consistently supported abortion choice; this ruled him out as Bob
Dole's running-mate in 1996, and may hurt his chances again next
year.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he tirelessly tries to persuade teenage
fathers to stay with their children (he leads a nationwide program
on this) and is as tough as old boots on crime.
</P>
<P>
   His first act as governor was to convene a special legislative
session which produced a law increasing punishments for crimes
against children and a ``three-strikes'' law against repeat
offenders. He then reintroduced capital punishment to the state,
signing over 100 death warrants.
</P>
<P>
   He is hardly a laisser-faire Republican, either. For example, he
set up a program under which the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania gives
poor workers 50 cents for every dollar they save, up to $600.
</P>
<P>
   ``To us (Republicans),'' he admits, ``it sounds odd for
government to be involved in encouraging people to save.''
</P>
<P>
   To some in his party, ``odd'' would hardly be the word for it.
``Completely misguided'' might be better, or perhaps ``socialist
meddling in areas which government should leave alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Ridge is unapologetic. He believes in governmental activism. ``I
get to do the stuff below the radar screen that makes a real
difference to people's lives. That's why I like being a governor so
much.''
</P>
<P>
   He is also strongly pro-business. ``One of my biggest challenges
was to change the perception that Pennsylvania was not a good place
to do business,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Since he took over in the Republican landslide year of 1994, he
has reduced the business-tax burden by $3 billion, partly by
tax-cutting and partly by regulatory reform. Pennsylvania is the
first state in America to have fully deregulated both the
electricity and the gas industries.
</P>
<P>
   But all this fiddling has not stopped Ridge cutting income
taxes, too. He has reduced state income taxes by about $2.6 billion
and he has kept the rise in state spending to 30 percent in cash
terms since 1995, a modest cut in real terms.
</P>
<P>
   In short, he is pro-business, sympathetic to the poor, a
tax-cutter, prepared to intervene in some markets, and
traditional-tough on some social issues, liberal on others.
</P>
<P>
   Are there wider implications of his success? (Which in electoral
terms has been considerable: in a state where Democrats heavily
outnumber Republicans, he won reelection by 57 percent of the vote
in a four-way race, the widest margin a Republican has ever
achieved in Pennsylvania.)
</P>
<P>
   It is tempting to say: No, he just has an unusually powerful
political personality. ``Relentless'' might be the Ridge family
motto. He numbers the indefatigable Teddy Roosevelt among his
heroes and he quotes with affection and approval his shoe-salesman
father's advice that ``if you're just relentless at pursuing
something, you'll get it done.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 625 OR CONTINUE TO 1,050) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   But there are bigger reasons for his success: the blurring of
the party's traditional division between social and economic
conservatives, and the re-emergence of a Republican center.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer Americans now say that they are angry with the government.
Swing voters in the coming election are likely to be financially
comfortable and politically moderate.
</P>
<P>
   The Pew Research Center, a polling organization, has recently
invented a new typology. It divides registered Republicans into
three groups: ``Staunch Conservatives,'' who are pro-business,
morally severe, critical of the government and hostile to taxpayer
help for the poor; ``Moderate Republicans,'' who are more
sympathetic to government action but no more tolerant than the
first group of state handouts for the needy; and ``Populist
Republicans,'' who think that businesses have too much power, that
the government should do more to help the poor _ but who also share
with Staunch Conservatives a general distrust of elected officials
and a strict conservative morality.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not you accept this exact categorization, the point
it highlights is that significant numbers of Republicans now take a
positive view both of government and of helping the poor (though,
paradoxically, groups who like the one do not necessarily like the
other). More than that, it makes clear that Ridge's somewhat
contradictory views reflect contradiction and confusion on the part
of voters themselves.
</P>
<P>
   He suits this new phenomenon _ not because he fits any of the
groups' profiles precisely (he doesn't) but because he has
something to offer everyone and because his pragmatic approach to
government is more important than any ideological differences.
</P>
<P>
   So Staunch Conservatives may not particularly like, say, his
ideas for helping the poor, or his views on abortion. But they do
not object all that strongly. And they like his pro-business views
and his crime-reduction policies.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson is that it may no longer be possible to be successful
from the confines of either social or laisser-faire conservatism.
You need a broader, if fuzzier, appeal.
</P>
<P>
   That implies more policy tolerance, more local experimenting and
more ad hoc problem-solving, not only because voters want
contradictory things but because different states will try out
different ideas.
</P>
<P>
   It needs a shift of power from the relative single-mindedness of
Washington, to the incoherence and ferment of 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge wants that. ``The new federalism that we seek,'' he says,
needs ``a new Republican Party.'' To be led, presumably, by George
W. Bush _ with the governor of Pennsylvania (abortion views
permitting) at his side. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Pills are small, light and pricey. Purchasers do not
need to touch them or try them on. Getting them from pharmaceutical
company to consumer, via wholesaler, distributor and pharmacy is
expensive. Sick people are reluctant to queue up in a shop, or to
discuss their herpes in public.
</P>
<P>
   So hurrah for the Internet, which cuts out middlemen, saves
costs and eliminates the trudge down to the local drug store.
</P>
<P>
   This was the premise behind a flurry of American online
pharmacies _ drugstore.com, PlanetRx.com and Soma.com _ which set
up in business over the past 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   They seemed to have it all: a big idea; backing from some of the
Net's heaviest hitters _ Amazon.com is the largest shareholder in
drugstore.com, and its boss, Jeff Bezos is on the board;
experienced managers _ the chief executive of PlanetRx hails from
Federal Express, while drugstore.com's used to work for Microsoft;
and, of course, minimal revenues and heavy losses.
</P>
<P>
   When drugstore.com, with revenues of $16 million and a $72
million loss, went public in July, only five months after opening
for business, its shares soared to a valuation of $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   PlanetRx.com, with less than $1 million in sales in its first
six months, was worth nearly $1.3 billion when it floated in
October.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the euphoria has not lasted. Both their share prices have
since fallen by half. Soma.com has been quietly renamed CVS.com
after being bought by the big retail pharmacy chain of that name.
</P>
<P>
   And analysts have turned from enthusiasts to skeptics: a
November survey in Business2.0, an Internet magazine, cited
drugstore.com as one of the ten ``least-trusted'' sites on the
Internet. Wags at Forrester Research talk of ``drugstore.toast.''
</P>
<P>
   The health-care market, it turns out, is both more complicated
and more competitive than the Internet companies imagined.
</P>
<P>
   The American market for prescription drugs is tightly controlled
by insurance companies and health-management organizations (HMOs)
whose job it is to keep health-care claim costs _ two-thirds of
Americans have private health coverage _ as low as possible.
</P>
<P>
   They employ henchmen known as pharmacy-benefit managers (PBMs)
to process health-insurance claims and oversee the distribution of
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Without the approval of a PBM, a drug retailer will not be
reimbursed for the cost of a prescription drug and so must charge
the customer the full cost _ on average $38 per prescription _
rather than the $5-10 so-called co-pay fee that is charged by most
health plans.
</P>
<P>
   These PBMs divide the market into three. The first bit, for
acute problems such as allergic reactions, can be handled only by
bricks-and-mortar pharmacies. Waiting for a pill to arrive in the
mail is hardly an option for someone with an attack of asthma.
</P>
<P>
   At the other extreme are 90-day repeat prescriptions for chronic
illnesses such as a heart condition or depression. The PBMs control
this lucrative segment, which they fulfill through their own
mail-order businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle is the market that everyone is fighting over _
30-day prescriptions, a huge business representing 87 percent of
America's 3 billion prescriptions a year and growing in value by 16
percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   The PBMs have tried this market and found it unprofitable for
their mail-order operations, so they have been willing to
relinquish it.
</P>
<P>
   In this market segment, online firms are competing with
conventional pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
   Companies such as Walgreens, CVS, Rite-Aid and Eckerd, which
together process some 28 percent of all prescriptions in America,
have the advantage of scale. They get discounts from drug makers
and wholesalers _ though even then, as Rite-Aid's recent profit
warnings suggest, it's hard to make much money.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, online stores do not have to invest in all those
shops. But the cost of fulfillment is turning out to be huge.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Razzouk, the chief executive of PlanetRx, says that so as
to maintain trust in a brand, firms must control everything from
taking an order to picking, packing and shipping it.
</P>
<P>
   Razzouk is investing ``millions and millions'' in automating his
company's 165,000-square-foot warehouse in Memphis, so that he can
keep the promises he makes in his $40 million of brand advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Drugstore.com currently outsources fulfillment _ odd, given
Bezos's obsession with building perfect distribution systems _
which is one reason for its poor reputation.
</P>
<P>
   PBMs are the second problem for online pharmacies. They
initially refused to accept online stores at all, but are now
changing their minds. They can see how they might exploit Web
pharmacies' advertising to attract more people into the mail-order
prescription market.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in return for allowing Web firms to fill insured
prescriptions, the PBMs either want to be paid for their
cooperation, or are demanding that they handle the distribution
themselves. In response, some online pharmacies have given up.
</P>
<P>
   Soma.com sold out to CVS, which has since allied itself with
Merck-Medco, a subsidiary of Merck, a drug firm. Merck-Medco is
America's biggest PBM.
</P>
<P>
   Others are scrambling to find backers. A reluctant drugstore.com
sold 25 percent of itself to Rite-Aid, which owns PCS, America's
second biggest PBM. Last month PlanetRx hooked up with Express
Scripts, the number three PBM, selling it a 20 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   Little of the value of these deals went to the online firm.
Merck-Medco fills all the 30-day mailed prescriptions ordered
through CVS.com from its own warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Express Scripts gets $11 million a year simply for giving
PlanetRx access to the customers of the HMOs it serves. Diana
Baumohl, head of planning, calls it ``a chance to test the Internet
and lose nothing,'' because Express does not need to consolidate
PlanetRx's losses.
</P>
<P>
   The physical stores have done well too. CVS got a fully formed
Internet channel for only $30 million. And, despite Drugstore.com's
share price fall, Rite-Aid is sitting on a paper profit of around
$320million _ handy given the group's current financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   None of this suggests that the Internet will not feature in drug
retailing. Online pharmacies are well-placed to collect and
eventually sell data on patients. That is one reason why
conventional pharmacies _ most recently, Walgreens _ are investing
in developing the Internet as another channel.
</P>
<P>
   But online retailers are unlikely to succeed as stand-alone
businesses. The idea that they could whip the entire business away
from existing health-care companies was a wild one. What were they
on? &QL;

   HONG KONG _ Forget Finland's reindeer, London's Dickens or New
York's FAO Schwartz. When it actually comes to making the stuff of
good tidings, Hong Kong is the most Christmassy place there is.
</P>
<P>
   From its companies come most of the world's toys, along with its
Christmas-tree lights, trimmings and yes, even the trees
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   For the big green spruce or sparkling white pine around which
their presents are stacked, millions of good little boys and girls
this year can thank just one Hong Kong company: Boto, the
abominable snowman of the fake-Christmas-tree industry, which has
captured nearly 45 percent of the American market.
</P>
<P>
   Boto's factories in Shenzhen, China employ 6,500 workers,
filling up to 50 containers a day with hand-wrapped triumphs of
faux foliage to spread cheer around the world.
</P>
<P>
   There are eighteen-foot pines, with real cones and authentic
smell; or smaller white, gold and silver varieties in flocked,
frosted or prelighted form; or just wreaths, centerpieces,
garlands, swags or sprays.
</P>
<P>
   Boto's vertically integrated operation makes everything from the
lights, ornaments and tinsel to PVC rigid film, which is cut up to
make ``needles.''
</P>
<P>
   While the eggnog flows, this is a great business. Thanks in part
to a glowing report by David Webb, a usually Scrooge-like
independent Hong Kong analyst, its shares are up nearly 6 percent
this week, near an all-time high.
</P>
<P>
   Sales, which are growing at 20 percent a year, will hit $100
million this year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is a fly in Boto's brandy butter. What does it do for
the rest of the year? The toy companies have birthdays, new
products and parental indulgence to keep their sales going
throughout the year. But there is little call for frosted elms in
July.
</P>
<P>
   This clever company has, however, found a neat solution: an
equivalent but opposite seasonal product.
</P>
<P>
   In the off months, its Shenzhen elves now make rather spiffy
garden furniture in a new factory next to its tree workshop. &QL;

 &HT;    SYRIAN MINISTER'S COMMENTS FIRE UP ISRAELI ANTICIPATION
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM Predictions by Syria's foreign minister Sunday that
his country could make peace with Israel in ``a few months'' has
raised Israeli expectations for the peace talks scheduled to start
this week
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a very important moment in the history of the
peace process,'' Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Sharaa told
reporters in Damascus. ``We think we can achieve genuine results
within a short time if all the parties have the good intentions.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharaa said he is optimistic that the two countries, which have
been officially at war since 1948, could conclude a deal in ``a few
months.''
</P>
<P>
   They were the first official comments from Syria about the talks
since they were announced by President Bill Clinton last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   This Wednesday, Sharaa will meet with Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak in Washington. The meeting, scheduled for two days, will
be the first time negotiators for the two countries have met
formally in more than three years and they are the highest contacts
between the two countries ever.
</P>
<P>
   Though their heavily fortified borders have been quiet since the
1973 war, the two countries have been officially at war for
decades. Syria has lead the block of Arab countries that have
refused to open relations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Spokespeople for Barak said the prime minister had no comment
about Sharaa's remarks. However, Israel was buzzing with
speculation after four days of rapid developments that have left
many shocked, pleased or both.
</P>
<P>
   Moshe Maoz, Syria expert at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem,
warned that there were also times of optimism during the failed
negotiations of that took place between 1994 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said Sharaa's comments were indicative of the
current Syrian mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's right. There are not many issues left to be discussed,''
Maoz said. ``This is also the line in Damascus.''
</P>
<P>
   The key issue for both sides is ownership of the Golan Heights,
a plateau about the size of Rhode Island. Syria used it to shell
Israeli towns until Israel captured it in the 1967 war. Syrian
leaders say they will make no deal unless all the Golan is
returned.
</P>
<P>
   Though most governments do not recognize the area as Israeli
land, Israel has settled about 17,000 people there. It is
considered by many as strategic high ground, but some analysts and
government ministers say its importance has dwindled in the age of
missile warfare. They say returning the Golan could end Israel's
war in Lebanon, a country basically controlled by Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Barak will speak to the Israeli parliament Monday, which is
expected to vote on some kind of statement about his trip.
Meanwhile, Barak has promised to hold a public referendum on any
deal with Syria and Israelis were already beginning to debate a
possible peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion is split, but some analysts believe it will be
hard for Israelis, ultimately, to turn down a deal with one of
their oldest enemies.
</P>
<P>
   In the Golan Heights town of Katzrin, officials moved up the
opening of a new subdivision in order to make their point that they
don't plan on leaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Golan is our homeland. We are not moving from the Golan,''
Avi Zeira, head of the Golan residents committee told Israel radio.
</P>
<P>
   Zeira's group planned a large protest outside the parliament
Monday. But some in Katzrin said they would be willing to abandon
their town in exchange for peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it's about time that Barak and (Syrian President
Hafez) Asad will sit together and we know the price,'' said Yoav
Tsur(cq), a 22-year Golan resident and member of a group backing a
peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   Tsur said he had been shocked by the announcement of the talks
and the Syrian and Israeli optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, I prefer its going to be fast,'' Tsur said. ``The worst
situation we have here is not knowing what is going to happen
tomorrow.''

   HONG KONG _ Forget Finland's reindeer, London's Dickens or New
York's FAO Schwartz. When it actually comes to making the stuff of
good tidings, Hong Kong is the most Christmassy place there is.
</P>
<P>
   From its companies come most of the world's toys, along with its
Christmas-tree lights, trimmings and yes, even the trees
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   For the big green spruce or sparkling white pine around which
their presents are stacked, millions of good little boys and girls
this year can thank just one Hong Kong company: Boto, the
abominable snowman of the fake-Christmas-tree industry, which has
captured nearly 45 percent of the American market.
</P>
<P>
   Boto's factories in Shenzhen, China employ 6,500 workers,
filling up to 50 containers a day with hand-wrapped triumphs of
faux foliage to spread cheer around the world.
</P>
<P>
   There are eighteen-foot pines, with real cones and authentic
smell; or smaller white, gold and silver varieties in flocked,
frosted or prelighted form; or just wreaths, centerpieces,
garlands, swags or sprays.
</P>
<P>
   Boto's vertically integrated operation makes everything from the
lights, ornaments and tinsel to PVC rigid film, which is cut up to
make ``needles.''
</P>
<P>
   While the eggnog flows, this is a great business. Thanks in part
to a glowing report by David Webb, a usually Scrooge-like
independent Hong Kong analyst, its shares are up nearly 6 percent
this week, near an all-time high.
</P>
<P>
   Sales, which are growing at 20 percent a year, will hit $100
million this year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is a fly in Boto's brandy butter. What does it do for
the rest of the year? The toy companies have birthdays, new
products and parental indulgence to keep their sales going
throughout the year. But there is little call for frosted elms in
July.
</P>
<P>

equivalent but opposite seasonal product.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Potent thunderstorms will erupt in portions of the Southeast as
humid air streaming north from the Gulf of Mexico intercepts a jet
stream disturbance passing overhead. An area of showers and
thunderstorms will march eastward from Alabama on Monday morning,
reaching the western Carolinas by afternoon. To the west, a broken
line of very strong thunderstorms will ignite over eastern
Mississippi, likely affecting Alabama by afternoon. Winds shifting
direction with increasing altitude will induce a few of the
thunderstorms to rotate. These storms, called supercells, are
capable of spawning tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   Showers and isolated thunderstorms will also occur from Arkansas
to the lower Ohio Valley as low pressure moves northeast from the
lower Mississippi Valley. Generally overcast and mild conditions
will cover the remainder of the East, except in Florida and along
the Southeast coast where there will be a few intervals of sun.
Moistening breezes from the Atlantic will cause a few light showers
near the east coast of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy snow will fall in the Wasatch Mountains of Utah as moist
air ahead of a cold front is forced to ascend the higher terrain.
Lighter snow showers will also pepper many of the west-facing
mountains of the northern Rockies. Windswept rain will lash the
Washington and northern Oregon coasts as a moist disturbance
arrives from the Pacific. Heavy snow will occur later today in the
Cascades. Ample sun and mild weather will cover much of California
and the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Atmospheric Memory
</P>
<P>
   This month, several storms have taken similar paths through the
southern Plains. In parts of southern Kansas, the spate of storms
has brought exceptional wetness over a relatively narrow zone.
Wichita has already had 3.95 inches of precipitation making the
month its third wettest December. The wettest December was in 1984
when 4.88 inches of precipitation fell. Some areas near Wichita
have had up to a foot of snow. The tendency for unlikely events to
recur in the same area has been dubbed ``atmospheric memory,'' but
its scientific underpinnings are not well understood.

<P>
   Talk about putting your money where your lobbyists' mouths are.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the nation's big satellite television companies,
DirecTV and EchoStar Communications, have wailed and railed in
Washington for the right to include local broadcasters in their
services. Two weeks ago, they finally got it.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the really hard work.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, DirecTV, with about 8 million subscribers, and
EchoStar, with about 3 million, may have to spend as much as $1
billion to deliver local stations, including local affiliates of
the four big broadcast networks, to dozens of markets nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, not every satellite subscriber will get local stations;
there may not be enough satellite capacity _ or economic motive _
to rebroadcast hundreds of local television stations and there
probably never will be. And in the case of EchoStar, even in areas
where the local service will be offered, many of its customers will
require new, slightly larger satellite dishes to pick up the
rebroadcast local signals.
</P>
<P>
   But such are the tradeoffs in the confluence of technology,
politics and finance that has characterized the development of the
satellite television business.
</P>
<P>
   Until two weeks ago, the satellite operators were forbidden by
law to transmit local channels _ including ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC
affiliates _ to most customers. The rationale for the restriction
was that the national satellite services might harm local
broadcasters by, say, beaming a New York City station into Des
Moines.
</P>
<P>
   But for years, the satellite companies howled that the local
restriction hurt them and consumers by keeping satellite television
from providing full competition to local cable television
monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized a while ago that it was, in our opinion, very
important if we were going to be effective competitors to cable
that we have the ability to offer local programming on fair
terms,'' said David K. Moskowitz, the EchoStar senior vice
president who oversees the company's local broadcasting initiative.
</P>
<P>
   So when President Clinton signed the Satellite Television Home
Viewers Act, which lifted the restriction, on Nov. 29 as part of a
spending bill, the satellite companies largely hailed the
development as opening the final door to competition with the cable
monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big fix,'' said Eddy W. Hartenstein, president of
DirecTV, which is part of General Motors' Hughes Electronics
subsidiary. ``The last remaining barrier why people haven't gotten
the service is they say, `Can I get my local channels?'''
</P>
<P>
   But for the satellite companies, the potentially lucrative
opportunities of carrying local broadcast signals will come at
considerable cost. DirecTV and EchoStar have already begun
transmitting local signals to big markets, including New York and
Los Angeles, and want to expand their offerings to dozens more
markets by the end of the year. But as the carriers roll out their
local offerings across the nation, the capacity of their existing
satellites will be sorely tested.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Federal Communications Commission has yet to write
the rules for implementing the new law. A big open question is how
many local stations within a market the satellite company will be
obliged to carry. While both DirecTV and EchoStar say they want to
offer the four major commercial broadcast network affiliates, they
argue that they should not be compelled to rebroadcast the dozen or
more less-watched stations in some big metropolitan areas.
</P>
<P>
   For both consumers and the satellite carriers themselves, the
wrinkles in offering local stations are largely a product of how
satellites are deployed and managed.
</P>
<P>
   Some 22,300 miles above the equator, there are three orbital
slots authorized for direct-broadcast satellites. At that altitude,
a satellite positioned at 101, 110 or 119 degrees west longitude
can serve all 48 contiguous states.
</P>
<P>
   At each of the three direct-broadcast satellite slots, there are
32 available frequencies. And on each frequency, current video
compression technology allows the satellite companies to transmit
up to 10 standard television channels.
</P>
<P>
   By the legacies and luck of FCC licensing, DirecTV controls all
32 frequencies at the 101-degree slot, an additional three at 110
degrees and another 11 at 119 degrees. EchoStar, meanwhile,
controls no frequencies at 101 degrees, 29 at 110 and 21 at 119.
</P>
<P>
   That means EchoStar, with 50 frequency slots, has more total
capacity than does DirecTV, with 46 frequency slots. The big catch,
however, is that standard satellite dish antennas can receive
signals from only one slot at a time. Almost all DirecTV
subscribers have their dishes pointed at the 101-degree position,
where DirecTV controls all 32 frequencies. Almost all EchoStar
subscribers aim at the 119-degree slot, where EchoStar has 21
frequencies.
</P>
<P>
   The difference has major implications for the ways the companies
will introduce local programming and for the steps users will or
will not have to take to view it.
</P>
<P>
   Because DirecTV controls all 32 frequencies at the 101-degree
slot, most DirecTV subscribers can theoretically receive up to 320
channels. DirecTV, however, now generally offers its customers a
maximum of about 225 channels.
</P>
<P>
   DirecTV intends to use the unused channel capacity at 101
degrees to beam down local broadcast signals. By the end of next
month, it plans to use its available channels to offer the four
major local broadcast affiliates to each of 20 to 25 markets, or
about half of the nation's TV households.
</P>
<P>
   But it is an inefficient process, since every DirecTV dish
antenna in the country will be catching signals of all of those 80
to 100 local affiliates. By scrambling and selectively unscrambling
the signals, DirecTV will enable subscribers in any one local
market to view only the local broadcasters from their home market.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, DirecTV subscribers in those 20 to 25 markets will not
need to recalibrate their dishes or buy new ones. That is why
DirecTV appears excited about the prospects of persuading its
existing customers to pay an additional $5.99 a month to receive
local programming as part of their satellite service. If even 20
percent of DirecTV's existing 8 million customers sign up, that
means about $115 million in additional annual revenue for the
company.
</P>
<P>
   EchoStar, however, finds itself in a somewhat more difficult
position. Since almost all EchoStar subscribers' dishes point to
119 degrees, where EchoStar controls only 21 frequencies, EchoStar
will not be able to deliver many, if any, new local channels to
subscribers using their existing dishes.
</P>
<P>
   And so, EchoStar intends to beam local channels mostly from
satellites in the 110 degree slot, which EchoStar obtained rights
to only last summer in a deal with the News Corp. and MCI Worldcom.
Receiving those signals, however, will require most EchoStar
customers to either add a second dish or replace their existing
dishes with a new model that can capture signals from two orbital
slots at once.
</P>
<P>
   That is why EchoStar does not talk so much about offering local
channels to existing customers but is promoting the new local
services to attract new customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our existing customers have found ways to satisfy
themselves without the network channels from our service,''
Moskowitz said. ``But there is an enormous population that has not
yet pulled the plug on cable because of the absence of local on
satellite. And that's what's so neat about this; it gives new
customers that reason.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their competitive positions now, though, both DirecTV
and EchoStar face the same regulatory uncertainty as the FCC writes
the rules to put the new satellite television law into effect.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for the satellite companies is that they want to
offer only the four big-network affiliates _ and maybe a few other
popular stations _ in each local market. But the FCC is expected to
rule that entering a given market obligates carriers to retransmit
every broadcast station in that market.
</P>
<P>
   Cable television systems are under a similar obligation, which
is known as the must-carry rule and which is meant to prevent
smaller stations from discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite companies say the requirement, which is expected
to take force in 2002, will require them to offer local service in
fewer markets than they might otherwise because it will quickly
consume too much of their satellites' channel capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Must-carry is a terrible thing, and I just don't understand
the logic of it,'' said Moskowitz, the EchoStar executive.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, DirecTV announced that it would buy and launch a new
satellite to help meet its must-carry obligations. Unlike the
company's traditional satellites, which beam signals to the entire
nation, the company's new so-called spot-beam satellite is expected
to make more efficient use of the companies' frequencies, allowing
them to be reused in different markets for rebroadcasting local
television channels.
</P>
<P>
   With communications satellites generally costing $250 million
each, EchoStar and its chairman, Charles W. Ergen, have not yet
committed to launching a new spot-beam satellite.
</P>
<P>
   Even without launching additional satellites, the companies
could end up spending hundreds of millions of dollars on the
various other on-the-ground systems that will be required to
transmit local channels to dozens of markets, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the satellite industry's continuing battle against cable
television, local stations may be the final weapon, one too
valuable to turn down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a growth business,'' Hartenstein said. ``We're
creating value from a business perspective, and we're creating a
great alternative to cable, especially with this last local
offering.''

   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1999 Special for The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was
the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch
of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of
Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it
was the winter of despair . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``THE SIXTIES'' &QL; 
Richard Avedon &QL; 
(Random House/Kodak, $75) &UR;
</P>
<P>
   It's my pleasure to tell you that Richard Avedon's new book,
``The Sixties,'' begins not with a photographic image but with the
opening paragraph of ``A Tale of Two Cities, words written 140
years ago but so remarkably suited to the edgy chaos of the 1960s
that you'll wonder whether Charles Dickens shared some funny
cigarettes with Abbie Hoffman in another life.
</P>
<P>
   Avedon and his collaborator, Doon Arbus, have put together a
book that shows the decade in all its abrasive and contradictory
glory. Notice the juxtaposition of Rose Kennedy and Janis Joplin
(at opposite ends of the book, each wearing her version of finery
and an eerie frown), Truman Capote displaying his belly button and
Andy Warhol his scars, the stiff stare of Henry Kissinger and the
serene gaze of Cesar Chavez. There's the requisite nudity _ female
breasts are outnumbered, for once, by male genitalia _ and every so
often a splash of color that reminds us that psychedelic was a
household word. It will make you squirm, and it will make you laugh
_ a '60s effect indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other big books you might spend your money on this
Christmas season:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``ILLUSTRATED LETTERS: ARTISTS AND WRITERS CORRESPOND'' &QL; 
Edited by Roselyne de Ayala and Jean-Pierre Gueno (Abrams, $60). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is the art of the handwritten letter taken to grand
heights. The editors have gathered more than 60 letters written by
European artists and authors of the 19th and 20th centuries. Some
are just notes with doodles in the margins. Others are illustrated
with exquisite sketches and watercolor scenes. Among the generous
correspondents: Honore de Balzac, Victor Hugo, Guy de Maupassant,
Arthur Rimbaud, Auguste Rodin, Edouard Manet, Vincent van Gogh,
Paul Gaugin, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Pablo Picasso, Max Jacob
and Antoine de Saint-Exupery. With a foreword by Francine Prose. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``FAY'' &QL; 
William Wegman (Hyperion, $26.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you've grown tired of Wegman's ubiquitous Weimaraners, this
book might pull you back into the fold. The text that accompanies
Wegman's photos of his beloved Fay Ray and her offspring, Battina
(who stayed on after Fay's other puppies went off to new homes),
reminds us that these were DOGS, that in addition to their work
with Wegman _ Fay, especially, knew how to hold a pose _ they
chased balls, hurled themselves into swimming pools, played in the
mud, mated, gave birth and changed their owner's life in ways not
just professional. If there's a dog lover on your Christmas list,
look here. &QL; 
 &QL; 
WOMEN &QL; 
Annie Leibovitz, with an essay by Susan Sontag (Random House,
$75). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Portraits of women, celebrated and obscure. It begins with a
photograph of Leibovitz's mother, then moves on to farmers, maids,
astronauts, soldiers, battered wives, Supreme Court judges,
showgirls and bull riders. More familiar faces are those of
Elizabeth Taylor, architect Maya Lin, writers Eudora Welty and
Jamaica Kincaid, Yoko Ono, Susan Sarandon, Joni Mitchell, Serena
and Venus Williams, Hillary Clinton and Madeleine Albright. It's
worth the price of admission just to see the kind gaze of the late
Osceola McCarty, who worked for 75 years as a Mississippi
washerwoman, then donated $150,000 that she'd saved over her
lifetime to establish a college scholarship for African-American
students in need. &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE ART OF THE MARKET &QL; 
Bob Tamarkin and Les Krantz (ST&AMP;C, $35). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An illustrated history of American business as seen through its
stock certificates. The paper certificates that were proof of
ownership before the days of electronic trading are becoming
financial artifacts with a value of their own. From a terrier named
Prince, who appeared on certificates issued by Farmers Deposit
National Bank in Pittsburgh in the early 1900s (Prince's owner was
the bank president), to the nude woman on certificates for Playboy
Enterprises, Tamarkin and Krantz show how whimsical a marriage of
art and commerce can be. &QL; 
``AND THE CROWD GOES WILD'' &QL; 
Joe Garner (Sourcebooks, $49.95). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The big draw is not the book, which is nothing extraordinary,
but two CDs that offer broadcasts of some of the most memorable
moments in sports. Included are Lou Gehrig saying goodbye to
baseball; Bill Mazeroski's home run in the 1960 World Series; the
Green Bay Packers' win over Dallas in December 1967; Bob Beamon's
long jump in the 1968 Olympics; Secretariat's triumph in the Triple
Crown; the Borg-McEnroe match at Wimbledon in 1980; Tiger Woods'
triumph at the 1997 Masters; Michael Jordan's sixth NBA
championship; and the U.S. women's win in soccer's 1999 World Cup.
With a foreword by Hank Aaron, an afterword by Wayne Gretzky, and
narration by Bob Costas. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``SNAKE'' &QL; 
Chris Mattison (DK, $29.95). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Big, bold pictures of creatures you don't want to find under
your Christmas tree. There are more than 60 individual species from
all over the world in Mattison's ``gallery,'' with information
about environment, anatomy, reproduction, and hunting and feeding.
A starter for would-be herpetologists. &QL; 
``NORMAN ROCKWELL: PICTURES FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE''  &QL; 
(Abrams, $35). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you love the paintings of Norman Rockwell, you can come out
of the closet now. Critics and art historians who previously looked
down their noses at Rockwell are now celebrating his influence on
the American psyche. This book, published in conjunction with the
traveling exhibition of the same name, includes 80 of Rockwell's
paintings, as well as essays not only by curators and historians
but by Robert Coles and Rockwell's son, Peter. The paintings are
anecdotal and as familiar as your own memories. The essays at times
seem like a collective  &UR; mea culpa offered to a man long regarded as
a mere illustrator, and to the people who have admired him for
decades. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``AFRICAN CEREMONIES'' &QL; 
Carol Beckwith and Angela Fisher &UR; Abrams, $150) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This slip-cased, two-volume set weighs 16 pounds, covers 26
countries and contains descriptions and photographs of more than 40
ceremonies, some of which will make you flinch just to think about
them. Spectacularly illustrated, it's the cornerstone of the
authors' effort to document vanishing tribal customs in Africa. &QL; 
``NEW YORK: AN ILLUSTRATED HISTORY'' &QL; 
Ric Burns and James Sanders &UR; (Knopf, $60). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a good deal of strolling on the thin edge of
nothingness. A splattering of fiery particles cascades down from
the torches that the steel workers use for cutting 10-ton girders
in half and for lighting their cigarettes.'' That's how the ``New
York Times'' described the spectacular bravado of the men who built
the Empire State Building in 1930, one of the best stories in this
elegant companion volume to the public television documentary
written and directed by Burns. &QL; 
``EARLY DYLAN'' &QL; 
Photographs by Barry Feinstein, Daniel Kramer and Jim Marshall
(Bulfinch, $35). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It could break your heart, he looks so young and happy. So do
Joan Baez and Mary Travers and even Johnny Cash. They stay that way
within the confines of this slim book, unlike the aging Dylan we
see in Richard Avedon's ``The Sixties.'' This collection of
photographs is a slice of '60s life that skirts the flamboyance and
focuses on a handful of people, their friendships and their music.
With a short foreword by Arlo Guthrie. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``YACHTING'S GOLDEN AGE'' &QL; 
Ed Holm (Knopf, $65) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here are more than 100 glass-plate images documenting yachting's
glory days, from 1880 to 1905. You don't have to know much about
sailing to see that these boats were extraordinary, each a
one-of-a-kind, handcrafted vessel with a unique personality. When
seen from across an expanse of water, they looked, Holm writes,
like ``a flight of giant migrating butterflies,'' their sails
swollen all out of proportion to the tiny crafts below. These
images were made by a handful of pioneering maritime photographers,
who used techniques developed in the years after the Civil War.

(jw) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON with ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For a brief period last month, it seemed that the
Goldman Sachs Group might become a victim of its own international
success.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann, the German telecommunications giant, had filed a
conflict-of-interest suit in London, arguing that Goldman should be
barred from advising the British wireless company Vodafone
AirTouch. On what grounds? Because Goldman had advised an investor
in Orange of Britain, a wireless company Mannesmann itself wanted.
</P>
<P>
   But the court called the suit hopeless, refusing to censure
Goldman for having too many of a good thing _ clients. In the end,
the episode underscored what investment bankers had known all
along: Goldman Sachs had become a dominant force in the redrawing
of Europe's telecommunications map.
</P>
<P>
   Chalk it up to the appetites of acquisition-hungry Europeans
eager to expand their network empires _ and to Goldman's years of
positioning itself to direct and underwrite that action.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Goldman has been an adviser on $239 billion of
telecommunications mergers in Europe. That represents an almost
fourfold increase over 1998, according to Thompson Financial
Securities Data, and enough to propel it from No. 11 to No. 1 on
the list of bankers in European telecommunications mergers. Not
only is Goldman the lead adviser for the voracious Vodafone,
Britain's largest wireless concern, but it acts as counsel to other
giants, most notably Deutsche Telekom, which Goldman took public in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   This rise to prominence has come at the expense of European
investment bankers like Lazard Freres &AMP; Co. and Schroders,
Britain's largest independent investment bank. They have not only
fallen behind Goldman on their own turf but know that its most
formidable opponent in the region is another American firm, Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   But the Europeans face more than bad luck. In a year when
American-style corporate takeovers are overrunning the traditions
of economic nationalism in Europe _ a few years ago, a hostile bid
by a British company for a German telecommunications company would
have been unthinkable _ the contestants need the American banks
that know best how to play the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've outmuscled all of us because of their single-minded
focus on winning,'' an investment banker at a European firm said of
Goldman. To illustrate his point, he began humming the theme song
from ``The A Team,'' a 1980s television show about a group of
rebels who brandished weapons to defeat their enemies. ``Goldman's
like the A Team. They're a real shoot-'em-up group.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman began its march into Europe more than a decade ago when,
anticipating a wave of privatization in telecommunications, the
firm began calling on government agencies to help them sell stakes
in state-owned telephone concerns. Scott Mead, a Cambridge-educated
American, was one of the core team to set up shop in 1988 in
London, where he is now co-head of Goldman's global communications,
media and entertainment group. His counterpart is another American,
Robert Harrison, a longtime Goldman partner who teamed up with Mead
early this year and is based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   One of the group's first deals was a public offering by
Telefonica SA, Spain's biggest telecommunications company, in the
late '80s. Other stock underwriting assignments followed, including
one by Britain's Cable and Wireless in 1989 and another by
TeleDanmark of Denmark in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But Goldman's big break came when it was picked by the German
government to sell a $13-billion stake in Deutsche Telekom in a
stock offering in 1996. The assignment became the cornerstone of
Goldman's campaign to court top-tier European telecommunications
players. ``It was the franchising of our German office,'' Mead
said. ``People could see the German government had faith in us and
this was a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Wooing Deutsche Telekom required a protracted courtship. Goldman
bankers from both London and Frankfurt had approached the German
company in 1990 about the prospects of a sale. They held regular
strategy sessions with executives along with several smaller
meetings, Mead recalled. Top executives from New York made regular
visits and in 1994, a Goldman associate began working from an
office in Deutsche Telekom headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Its established relationships with European telephone companies
helped Goldman to pounce as new businesses like wireless
communications and Internet access were spun out of the telephone
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Goldman strategy is if it was owned by the government,
take it private,'' said Howard Anderson, chairman of the Yankee
Group, a telecommunications research firm. ``If it is private, take
it public. Then merge it. They are a transaction machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider the case of Spain's Terra Networks SA, a provider of
Internet access and content in Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking
countries, which Goldman took public last month and whose market
value reached $13.9 billion as of Friday. Terra Networks is a unit
of Goldman's oldest European telecom client, Telefonica.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman's European base has also enabled the firm to enhance
client relationships in the United States. In 1998, for instance,
Goldman advised the Ameritech Corp., the Chicago-based telephone
company, on its purchase of a 34.4 percent stake in another Goldman
client, Denmark's state-owned TeleDanmark, for $3.1 billion. That
deal led to Goldman's advising Ameritech on its sale earlier this
year to SBC Communications Inc., Mead said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, if any company has put Goldman on the map in
Europe it has been Vodafone AirTouch. Few people in the United
States had even heard of the company until last January, when it
defeated Bell Atlantic in a bidding contest to buy Airtouch
Communications, one of the largest American cellular phone
companies, for $77 billion. And then, as if to show there were no
hard feelings, Vodafone followed up in the summer with the
announcement of an $80 billion cellular joint venture _ with Bell
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone executives knew Goldman as far back as 1988, when the
firm helped with the spinoff of Vodafone from Racal Electronics, a
military-electronics company. In the early going, Goldman did not
conduct much business for Vodafone because the telecommunications
company was not actively pursuing deals, said Christopher Gent,
Vodafone's chief executive. In fact, Goldman nearly lost the
account altogether when it played lead banker for the 1996 initial
stock offering of a Vodafone competitor, Orange, without conferring
with Vodafone.
</P>
<P>
   To make amends, Gent said, Goldman's chief executive at the
time, Jon Corzine, called him personally to apologize. ``We came to
an understanding early on of what was expected of them,'' Gent
recalled. ``I expected them to commit to us.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not long before Mead began to call on Gent personally.
</P>
<P>
   The two men hit it off, and Gent recalls a strategy meeting in
1997 where they came up with the notion that telecommunications
companies like Vodafone would either ``hunt or be hunted.'' To
survive in a global market, Gent said, ``we had to do it by
transactions, not by being stealth.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman leaped into action, dispatching teams from both Europe
and the United States to begin working up a strategy with Vodafone,
resulting in the AirTouch and Bell Atlantic forays and the ongoing
effort to take control of Mannesmann.
</P>
<P>
   But even Gent is mindful of the risk Goldman has taken by
choosing to represent his company in the Mannesmann battle. Germany
is one of its most lucrative markets, and if the strategy
backfires, the Goldman name will surely lose some luster there.
``It was a huge decision for them to back us in Germany because
they are so strong there,'' Gent said. ``It could hurt them. I'm
sure there was a lot of discussion at Goldman about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Last January, Harrison, a longtime Goldman partner and friend of
Mead's since their university days in Britain in the late 1970s,
joined him at Mead's invitation to co-head the communications,
media and entertainment group. Through the spring, over several
dinners in Manhattan at Provence in SoHo and other French bistros,
and through frequent trips between New York and London, the two
mapped out their group's strategy for adapting to a fast-changing
telecommunications world.
</P>
<P>
   First,  &UR;  &LR; Mead and Harrison decided that Goldman's 175
telecommunications bankers worldwide should focus on two types of
concerns: ``super league'' telecommunications companies, of which
they say there are some 60 worldwide, including the likes of
Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom; as well as emerging telecom
companies. ``We are looking for the next Global Crossing, huge
users of capital that require high-yield financing,'' Harrison
said, alluding to an upstart telecommunications company that
Goldman and others have advised, which is investing in undersea
cables for Internet use. ``Right now it is a question of finding
them.''
</P>
<P>
   And it is a question of whether Goldman can provide service to
them. Goldman has always been strong in merger advice and taking
companies public. But high-yield finance _ debt financing with
sufficient risk that investors demand a higher interest rate _ has
never been Goldman's forte. Hoping to change that, Goldman recently
hired David Solomon, a noted Wall Street rainmaker and former
co-head of investment banking at Bear, Stearns, to help lead its
newly expanded global high-yield banking business.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Galbraith, an investment banking and brokerage analyst at
Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co., is one of many in the industry who are
closely watching Goldman's high-yield effort. ``It is the only part
of their arsenal they are missing,'' Galbraith said. ``It will be
interesting to see if this strategy works out.''
</P>
<P>
   And in a nod to the colliding worlds of technology,
telecommunications and media, Goldman's global communication group
has set up a joint venture with its technology team to represent
Internet companies and telecommunications equipment makers. It is
not unusual for technology and telecommunications bankers to cross
paths, but until now they have typically called on clients
separately in order to protect lucrative fiefs.
</P>
<P>
   If Goldman's approach is successful, other investment banks
might be tempted to follow suit. If not, Goldman may find its
bankers divided by turf battles that could leave the firm
vulnerable to competitors all too happy to swoop in and steal
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their vision is: fortune favors the bold,'' Anderson, the
Yankee Group chairman, said of Goldman's success in Europe. ``We'll
see how well they apply it to their own business in the coming
years.''

   As the second millennium draws to a close, it's easier to
compile a list of milestones in advertising than in other fields.
The first few centuries were pretty much marketing-free, it seems,
unless someone discovers that the Luddites carried posters during
the Industrial Revolution with the slogan ``Just undo it.''
</P>
<P>
   And while there were some rudimentary forms of advertising in
the 18th and 19th centuries, it was not until the turn of the 20th
century _ when mass-produced, name-brand products began to be
promoted through mass media like billboards and magazines _ that
Madison Avenue assumed its familiar form.
</P>
<P>
   What follows are two highly subjective lists, each in
alphabetical order. The first dares to designate one columnist's
selections for the 100 most powerful corporate, media and product
brands of the 20th century. Some of them started in the 19th
century but rose to prominence during the 20th.
</P>
<P>
   The second list dares to predict 21 brands that will be powerful
in the 21st century, based on their performance in the 1990s.

 By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When traditional retailers mistakenly label an item the wrong
price _ for instance, marking a $99 item $9.90 _ they might have to
apologize to a customer and give a quick lesson in decimals to a
clerk. On the Internet, they have to be prepared either to lose
face or to part with a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com is the latest Web site to confront this problem.
Early last week, it received a slew of visits from people who read
newspaper advertisements listing a Toshiba DVD player for $199.99.
When customers saw the actual retail price listed on the site,
$249.99, Amazon faced a no-win situation: Either honor the
advertised price and lose money, or explain the mistake and risk
losing the customers.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon ultimately decided to sell its stock of DVD players at
the advertised price, limiting customers to two per order. ``What
else can you say _it was an error,'' said Paul Capelli, an Amazon
spokesman. Capelli declined to say how many players the company
sold or how much money it lost in all. ``What's important is we're
taking a customer-centric approach to the solution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Internet retailers are coming to grips with the notion that
pricing errors can be far more costly online than in traditional
stores. Thanks to chat rooms, e-mail and shopping ``bots,'' or
automated robots, like MySimon and DealTime, which survey prices on
products offered at thousands of sites, such mistakes rarely remain
a secret for long. What is more, Web merchants have made a habit of
slashing prices to startling levels to attract customers, so those
same merchants cannot appeal to the reasonable expectations of
their customers when a pricing glitch happens.
</P>
<P>
   Buy.com ran afoul of those expectations earlier this year when
it listed a $588 Hitachi computer monitor on its site for $164.
Buy.com began taking the orders, but after realizing the error, the
company agreed to sell only what it had in stock at the time to the
first customers who ordered at the lower price, then refused to
honor the other orders placed. The company is now in the midst of a
class-action lawsuit based, in part, on its handling of the matter.
</P>
<P>
   A more innocuous version of this happened to Ashford.com, a
seller of luxury goods, which earlier this month posted five
watches for sale priced at $0.00 _ with free shipping, no less. The
company said consumers understood Ashford.com's decision not to
give away the timepieces, given their combined value of $11,332,
but the resulting bad press did little for the start-up's image.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mary Lou Kelley, Ashford.com's vice president for
marketing, the pricing mistakes were the result of a system used to
set up its merchandising pages before they were published on the
site. Under that system, which has since been scrapped, items were
given $0.00 prices until the correct number was entered.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kelley said the company posted a disclaimer on its site,
stating that it was not responsible for pricing errors, but she
added that the company would evaluate such situations case by case.
``We'll do whatever we can to make customers happy, short of giving
watches away,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is it more costly for Internet retailers to make such
mistakes than their off-line counterparts, but Web merchants are
far more prone to commit such errors, said Erik Brynjolfsson, a
professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan
School of Management. Brynjolfsson recently completed a study of
Internet pricing, and found that Web merchants changed their prices
``much more frequently'' than brick-and-mortar stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much easier to change prices on the Net, and the benefits
are much greater, because of shopping bots,'' Brynjolfsson said,
noting that even 1 cent price reductions can give companies greater
exposure on price comparison sites. ``But that presents a big
opportunity for mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   However _ and this news will not endear him to bargain hunters _
Brynjolfsson said that pricing errors would decrease with time,
``as pricing technologies and systems get more accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But in the short run,'' he said, ``these companies have to
discover the kinds of really stupid things they can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Anthony, chief executive of Brookstone, said the company
relied on a team of ``four to five people'' to verify prices on its
site, in the company catalog and in Brookstone's stores. ``It also
helps that we have one price on our items, no matter how you buy
them, so there's less of a chance of a mixup,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When a pricing error does occur on his site _ a situation that
has yet to happen _ Brookstone ``will appeal to the reasonable
expectations of our customers,'' Anthony said, adding that ``most
people are reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, he said, ``there are so many crazy pricing schemes
on the Internet that a lot of people wouldn't be sure what is a
reasonable price, so we'd have to look at each situation
differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the concept of reasonable pricing on the Web has all but
disappeared with the advent of free computers, free Internet access
and merchants who have not been compelled by Wall Street to focus
on profits. That, in turn, has made it more difficult for consumer
advocates to deal with such cases.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission generally occupies itself with
unfair business practices like so-called bait-and-switch pricing
and cedes issues of pricing errors to state jurisdictions. State
contract laws, meanwhile, typically protect merchants who make a
genuine error in pricing.
</P>
<P>
   But other watchdog organizations may set higher standards. The
Better Business Bureau Online, for instance, is drafting a new set
of standards for Web merchants who want to post the organization's
seal of approval on their sites. The current version of the draft
requires merchants to ``comply with all commitments,
representations, and other promises made to a consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether that statement would require a merchant to sell a DVD
player for $100 as a result of an advertising error, however, is an
open question. ``We're open to feedback on this one,'' said Russ
Bodoff, the Better Business Bureau Online's chief operating
officer. ``It's a difficult issue, because the Internet presents
real questions around this area of consumer expectations.''

   GIRLS-SPORTSEQUITY _ ATLANTA _ In 1972, the year when women
first were allowed to serve as FBI agents and the Equal Rights
Amendment was passed by Congress, something called Title IX became
federal law. It mandated that school athletics programs for boys
and girls be given comparable support. More than 27 years later,
gender equity still is not the standard in most Georgia high
schools. Not even close. (Fish/Milliron, Atlanta Journal
Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   WITH
</P>
<P>
   EQUITY-GHSA _ FORSYTH, Ga. _ Seated around a horseshoe-shaped
conference table, the executive committee of the Georgia High
School Association gathers twice a year to wrestle with everything
from the date of the first football practices to judging criteria
for dramatic interpretation and public speaking. Much like the high
schoolstudents whose extracurricular activities they influence, the
committee tends to break into cliques: a large group of football
coaches and athletics directors at one end of the table,
African-Americans in another section and the two women committee
members across from them, side by side. In 50 years, at least 2,500
persons have served on the committee, which governs after-school
functions involving 200,000 Georgia boys and girls. Five of them
have been women _ two-tenths of 1 percent of the committee's total
membership. To critics of the GHSA, that gender gap speaks volumes
about the attention the organization gives to girls sports in high
schools. (Fish/Milliron, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

PATENTS: NEW INVENTIONS FOR HOLIDAY GIFTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ohio, Md., Conn., Wash., N.J., Va.)  (lb)

<TEXT>
<P>
   If there are still hard-to-satisfy friends and relatives on your
holiday gift list, consider that by next year you may be able to
wrap some new inventions for them. The following are some of the
gifts you might ponder for those people from among this year's new
patents:
</P>
<P>
   _ Though it is conventional wisdom that most men are either
boxer or brief wearers, there must be some who cannot decide which
underwear they prefer. For them, Robert Wald of Toluca Lake,
Calif., has patented boxer shorts that double as briefs. The
``briefs are sewn inside the shorts and both are integrated with a
single waistband,'' Wald writes in his patent (5,978,971).
</P>
<P>
   The briefs cannot be seen from the outside, so the ``look of
boxer shorts is provided with the added benefit of built-in
invisible male briefs for supporting the male anatomy,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   _ Women seem just as decisive about not going out in public with
curlers in their hair, but if there is a great-aunt on your list
who still does that, imagine her surprise when you come up with the
perfect present. Carolyn Davidson of Westerville, Ohio, has a
patent (5,868,147) for a discreet way of wearing curlers.
</P>
<P>
   Your aunt can wrap Ms. Davidson's fake hair strips around her
rollers. The hair strips have hook-and-loop fasteners on each end.
A woman (or man or child, if that is the case) would wrap the hair
strips around rollers that are already rolled around her wet but
real hair, and then press the hook-and-loop patches together to
fasten the strip in place.
</P>
<P>
   _ Anyone of any age might like Brent Farley's and Paul Hebert's
hair dryer. Farley, from Baltimore, and Hebert, from Manchester,
Conn., have a patent (5,944,031) for a hair dryer shaped like a
hand. On one side are bands on the finger and wrist portions for
slipping over a real hand; the other side features bristles like
those found in a hair brush.
</P>
<P>
   Heated air is forced through a chamber in the middle and out
through ducts in the bristles. The heater and pump for the air are
installed in a base, which also holds the dryer when it is not in
use. Users would slip the dryer on to dry, brush and style.
</P>
<P>
   _ Exercise aficionados and serious body builders are always keen
to to make the most of each workout in the time available. For
them, Heinz Klasen, an inventor in Berlin, has patented vibrating
barbells. His design looks like a conventional barbell, with a bar
bearing weights on each end. But Klasen has added a vibrator and a
dampening device in the middle of the bar.
</P>
<P>
   Klasen's patent (5,868,653) says that the vibrations stimulate
the muscles and nerves involved in the exercise, resulting in
faster muscle building with less cramping. He writes that
comparisons with conventional training methods show that the same
results ``can be achieved with a time expenditure up to
approximately 80 percent lower'' when his vibrating bar is used.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   _ None of us may ever again hear the warning ``Your shoe is
untied,'' if someone presents us with Sasha and Jordan Meschkow's
shoelace warning system. Instead we will hear an alarm. The
Meschkows own a patent (5,936,538) for conductive shoelace segments
hooked up to an indicator, battery and switch that are activated
when the segments fail to touch.
</P>
<P>
   The system also includes a pressure sensor, so that it can
detect weight in the shoe. That way, when the shoes are untied
because they are not being worn, the alarm will not sound. The
Meschkows envision that the alarm could be a buzzer, a light or a
series of lights.
</P>
<P>
   _ The handymen and handywomen on your list may think they have
all the home project tools they need, but James Conrad and Michael
Baxter, both of Mountlake Terrace, Wash., have invented a rake that
might surprise them.
</P>
<P>
   Their patent (5,979,957) is for a rolling, magnetic rake that
can pick up nails and other bits of metal from construction
projects. The round, wheel-shaped magnets are fitted on an axle
with a perpendicular handle like a conventional rake. In their
patent, the inventors say the ``magnets are arranged to project a
magnetic field before, under and behind the operating head'' of the
rake so it can sweep ``a swath clean of magnetically attractable
debris.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Your traveling friends might like a disposable toothbrush with
toothpaste already included. Mohan Sanduja, Carl Horowitz and Lina
Zilberman, all of New York, and Kenneth Sugathan of New Jersey, got
together and designed a toothbrush with a paste bonded to its
bristles.
</P>
<P>
   Their patent (5,888,578) covers a chemical grafting method that
they say ``locks in the flavor until the product can be utilized.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Finally, there are those who like to while away their time in
the restroom by reading. Farhad Asskaryar of Alexandria, Va., would
like to add music to the experience. Asskaryar describes his patent
(5,978,975) as a ``unique sound system installed inside a toilet
tank lid.''
</P>
<P>
   His design features an ``AM and FM radio, tape cassette player
and/or a CD player'' and a ``loudspeaker system similar to any
sound system available in the market.'' It attaches to any
conventional toilet and uses electricity or battery power. ``One
only needs to replace the top cover of the conventional toilet
water tank,'' Asskaryar writes. Of course, he adds, ``the entire
system is designed to be water resistant in order to avoid
electrical hazards.''
</P>
<P>
   Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be
ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent
and Trademark Office, Washington, DC 20231.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the theme from ``Mission Impossible'' played in the
background, Kirk Bailey and a crowd of about 150 other computer
security experts waited for the results of a high-technology
treasure hunt. The prize? Bailey's most personal information.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey, whose job includes protecting the privacy of medical
records, considers himself an average citizen, though somewhat more
careful about what he calls the ``fragile condition'' of privacy
today. In October, Bailey dared a group of security experts to
spend two months trying to dig up as much as they could about him.
Their only constraints were to stay within the confines of the law
and to avoid asking his family or friends for help.
</P>
<P>
   The results surprised even Bailey, who as manager of information
security at the Regence Group, an alliance of health insurance
plans, has forced him to think like an information thief to better
protect the privacy of medical records.
</P>
<P>
   Without his cooperation, permission or knowledge, the
researchers found a scannable sample of his signature; his speaking
schedule over the last two years, courtesy of an Internet search
engine; and details of his cat's diet by ``Dumpster diving.'' They
got copies of his home phone bills, though not cell phone records,
learned the value of his home and even discovered that he had been
born by Caesarean section on April 30, 1951, and got a C in English
at the University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The nine researchers were all members of the Agora, a group of
more than 550 information managers from some 120 companies and at
least 60 government agencies, founded to improve the security of
personal information.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an enormous invasion on my comfort,'' said Bailey, who
founded the group in 1995 and named it after the marketplace where
ancient Greeks gathered to exchange information and gossip. ``Here
I can be sitting in my warm living room by the fireplace with my
wife, and I think my privacy is protected, but in fact that's just
a thin veneer and illusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Some information his colleagues gathered proved embarrassing,
some potentially dangerous to his financial security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now everyone knows I'm overdue on a couple of my bills,'' he
said, ``and they have information on my birth, with the necessary
three pieces of information: name, Social Security number and date
of birth.''
</P>
<P>
   The last four digits of a Social Security number, he noted, are
often used as a default personal identification number.
</P>
<P>
   The accumulated information cost less than $100 and required no
special training to find. Researchers collected it while holding
down full-time jobs, said Kristina Laidler, an information
technology supervisor with the Regence Group who had been
designated the event's ``raid controller.''
</P>
<P>
   She was surprised how easy it was to get Bailey's birth
certificate and college transcript. ``Those things just took no
effort. It was like punching through tissue paper,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators did occasionally resort to what they called
``social engineering,'' more commonly known as schmoozing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computers are great, but computers are not going to give you
all the information you need,'' said Brett Kappenman, another Agora
investigator.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, no single bit of information was particularly
dangerous. But in aggregate _ and in the wrong hands _ it could be
ruinous.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could cut and paste his signature from his marriage license
or divorce decree and put his signature on anything,'' Ms. Laidler
said. ``We could've closed his bank account that day. We could've
turned off his lights, we could've refinanced his house, and we
could've gone out and purchased a Mercedes Benz'' using easily
obtainable banking information and a few well-placed fake
references.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., who is sponsoring a federal bill to
protect the privacy of medical records, attended the presentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``As someone in political life, I know I have very little
privacy,'' he later said in an interview. ``But the ordinary
citizen ought to be scared to death by what we saw today.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumers can make themselves less vulnerable to such invasions
of their privacy by obtaining an annual credit report on
themselves, adding a ``fire wall'' to their home computer's
Internet connection or buying $50 software that can make them
invisible to other computers online, Ms. Laidler said.
</P>
<P>
   Online consumers should also read the privacy policies of Web
retailers to make sure they do not distribute personal information.
And home buyers should ask real estate agents not to send financial
information by e-mail, which is easily intercepted, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have to understand their information doesn't just live
at the bank,'' Ms. Laidler said.
</P>
<P>
   In exposing his vulnerabilities so publicly, was Bailey just
giving crooks free pointers?
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad guys have already started to demonstrate they know how
to do this,'' he said.

   RCN Planning to Acquire Small Local Phone Carrier
</P>
<P>
   Expanding its communications footprint from the East Coast to
the Midwest, RCN has agreed to acquire 21st Century Telecom Group,
a small local communications carrier based in Chicago, for about
$260 million in stock, executives close to the talks said. The deal
is expected to be announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   RCN, based in Princeton, N.J., and so far operating mainly in
the corridor between Boston and Washington, is the biggest company
competing against the regional Bell companies for residential
customers.

   Polls Show Little Year 2000 Concern
</P>
<P>
   With the days winding down until the new year, each new survey
or poll seems to add to the evidence that Americans are confident
that Year 2000 computer glitches will not have much effect on their
lives. The results add up to a challenging climate for many
entrepreneurs, particularly those who expected that disruptions and
public concern would be in full swing.
</P>
<P>
   A Century of Powerful Advertising
</P>
<P>
   Madison Avenue did not assume its familiar form until this
century, when mass-produced, name-brand products began to be
promoted through mass media. So in the spirit of summing up a
century, it only makes sense to designate the 100 most powerful
corporate and product brands of the 20th century, which must
include McDonald's, and predict which brands will be powerful in
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Web Helps Lift Newspaper Stocks
</P>
<P>
   The stocks of newspaper companies jumped last week as the
industry's numbers seemed to please both those who care about
cyclical trends and those enamored of Internet highfliers. Company
by company, executives reported at a media conference that the
cyclical business was thriving. And they also said that revenues
from their Internet properties were growing exponentially.
</P>
<P>
   GM to Run Plants at Full Speed
</P>
<P>
   Despite slowing sales and bulging inventories of unsold cars,
General Motors announced that it planned to continue running its
North American factories at close to full speed through the first
quarter of next year.
</P>
<P>
   WTO to Discuss Future at Meeting
</P>
<P>
   Struggling to recover from the conference in Seattle that
collapsed in failure, the World Trade Organization plans a special

<P>
   Cruise Line Predicts Rosy Outlook
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Norwegian Cruise Line, who have rejected a $1.7
billion takeover bid by Carnival, predicted a rosy financial
outlook in what analysts said was an appeal to shareholders tempted
by the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Book of `Millionaire' Final Answers
</P>
<P>
   Since Walt Disney's Hyperion moved in last month with its
corporate cousin, ABC, the television network and the publisher
have become extremely cozy. Hyperion just hit the lottery with a
$10.95 official handbook to ABC's popular quiz show ``Who Wants to
Be a Millionaire.'' The show's writers helped to develop the book,
which has answers to perilous questions, and the game's host, Regis
Philbin, did his share by holding up the handbook during one of the
shows.
</P>
<P>
   New Directions Seen for `Moesha'
</P>
<P>
   UPN wants ``Moesha,'' the biggest comedy hit in the brief
history of the network, to veer off into what one network executive
called ``new creative directions'' _ and the show's new executive
producers are willing to do it.

SYRIA OPTIMISTIC ABOUT PEACE DEAL WITH ISRAEL
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria _ Syria expressed confidence Sunday that a peace
deal with Israel could be concluded quickly, perhaps in a matter of
months.
</P>
<P>
   The statement by Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa, who is to
head Syria's delegation to the talks in Washington this week, was
Syria's first official reaction to the announcement that he would
meet Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel. From a government that
has made caution its mantra, al-Sharaa's buoyant demeanor seemed a
startling departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so optimistic to say that a few months could be enough to
reach a peace agreement,'' the foreign minister said. He said that
Syria regarded the meetings as ``a very important moment in the
history of the peace process,'' and added: ``We think we can
achieve genuine results within a short time if all the parties have
the good intentions.''
</P>
<P>
   This week's negotiations, scheduled to last for two days, will
be the highest-level negotiations ever between two sides, whose
conflict has lasted for more than a half-century.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has also said he thinks an accord can be reached within a
few months, although his office in Jerusalem said that it would not
comment on Sunday's Syrian statement.
</P>
<P>
   There is a sense of expectation surrounding the planned talks,
which will mark the first time in 45 months that the two sides will
meet face to face. President Clinton said over the weekend that the
issues dividing Syria and Israel were not as great as those in
other Middle East disputes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult, but not as complex in my view as the
Palestinian negotiation talks with Israel,'' Clinton said in a
radio interview with CBS News.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, who met with al-Sharaa
here Sunday, said he believed that Syria was ``adamant that she
should receive peace in the shortest possible time.'' In Berlin,
meanwhile, Shimon Peres, the former Israeli prime minister,
expressed confidence that Israel could make peace with Syria within
the next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a note of caution was struck by Lebanon, which along with
Syria is the last of Israel's neighbors to remain a holdout to
peace. Lebanon and Syria have promised to work side by side in any
negotiations, and a Lebanese delegation is expected to join in
further talks after next week's opening round of discussions
between Israel and Syria is completed.
</P>
<P>
   President Emile Lahoud of Lebanon warned that the new talks were
bound to be difficult. ``The current development in the peace
process is very delicate, and the expected negotiations would not
be easy; they would have their good and bad times,'' Lahoud said,
according to a presidential spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The deal to resume talks was sealed Wednesday during a telephone
conversation between Clinton and Hafez al-Assad, the Syrian
president. Until Sunday, Syrian officials had not spoken publicly
about the new course.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for that silence, Syrian officials here say, was the
need to present the plan to the National Progressive Front, which
is nominally Syria's top political body. That group, composed
mainly of leaders of the ruling Baath Party and led by Vice
President Zuheir Masharqa, declared its support for renewed talks
at a meeting on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The main issue dividing Israel and Syria is the fate of the
Golan Heights, captured by Israel in the 1967 war. As its price for
peace, Syria has always demanded that Israel withdraw from every
inch of that land, but any deal would also have to address other
issues, including water rights and security guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most sensitive of the outstanding issues involves the
fate of a technologically advanced Israeli radar installation on
the peak of Mount Hermon, at the northern tip of the Golan. The
installation is usually visible from Damascus, the Syrian capital.
</P>
<P>
   A former Israeli official, Uzi Arad, was quoted by Israeli army
radio Sunday as saying that Assad had agreed in 1998 to allow
Israel to retain control over the installation. But that idea has
been questioned by Damascus-based diplomats, who have said they
cannot imagine that Syria will accept such an arrangement.

LOVE SONGS THAT ANCHOR THOSE STORM-TOSSED AFFAIRS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JON PARELES   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Songs that sound clear and easy don't get much
respect in the 1990s. Rock and hip-hop bands swathe their tunes in
noise; ballad singers pour on melismas and huff and puff through
crescendos. Many pop and country songs bulk up with booming drums
and synthesizers. Surrounded by overstatement, Marshall Crenshaw,
who performed at the Bowery Ballroom on the night of Dec. 9, is
more than ever a songwriter defying his era.
</P>
<P>
   When he started making albums in the '80s, he ignored the peppy
angularity of new wave rock to hark back to Buddy Holly and the
Beatles. Since then he has quietly annexed surf rock, bossa nova,
folk rock, old-fashioned country music and other pre-'70s styles
that put melody first. His tunes pretend to roll off the guitar,
though they conceal asymmetries and sly chord changes. And his
winsome tenor voice stays gentle and earnest, sliding ahead of the
beat and smoothing the corners of every phrase.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw almost always sings about love, from the first sparks
of infatuation to domestic complications to betrayals and breakups.
While he has the voice of a nice guy, the lyrics can tell other
stories. Songs from his new album, ``No. 447'' (Razor and Tie),
face the aftermath of cheating from both sides. In ``Television
Light'' he's overcome with regrets, while in ``Tell Me All About
It'' he confronts a straying partner, then decides he doesn't
really want to know the details.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw respects the verities of intro-verse-chorus-bridge; he
also toys with them. True to pop classicism, his songs rely on the
contrast between the stability of song form and the volatility of
the relationships he sings about. Onstage he raised that tension,
as Diego Voglino's drumming brought out the offbeats, tugging
against the rhythm of Crenshaw's guitar and vocal lines. In
``Laughter,'' with forlorn lyrics about a couple's happier
memories, Crenshaw and Chris Cunningham on guitars sent modal lines
rippling and echoing around the beat, making Crenshaw sound even
more bereft.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the night's set he juxtaposed yearning songs with
disillusioned ones. But he held on to pop's deep-seated optimism,
hoping the next romance would be as sure-fire as an uplifting tune.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Rigby, who shared the bill, recently moved to Nashville,
where her smart, funny, twang-driven songs like ``20 Questions''
could be turned into country hits. But she has more to reveal than
her cleverness. Her well-turned folk-rock and country-rock songs
portray two endless struggles: one simply to get by, another
between lust and common sense.
</P>
<P>
   She keeps falling for bad guys who exasperate her but thrill
her, too; her voice often started out wry and ended up furious.
``Let's leave reality of this, shall we?'' she suggested in one
song, knowing better but succumbing all the same.

UPN ENCOURAGES `MOESHA' TO FIND A NEW DIRECTION  
 HIT TV QUIZ SHOW SPAWNS A POPULAR BOOK  
 PUBLISHING GATHERING TO RETURN TO NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ UPN wants ``Moesha,'' the biggest comedy hit in the
brief history of the network, to veer off into what one network
executive called ``new creative directions'' _ and the show's new
executive producers are willing to do it.
</P>
<P>
   That willingness contrasts with the reluctance of the show's
original executive producer, Vida Spears, who is said to have been
so opposed to the requested changes that she was fired two weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday the first of the new batch of ``Moesha'' episodes
was taped in Los Angeles, and Jacque Edmonds, one of three new
executive producers on the show, said, ``This is a fifth-year show,
and we'd like to do some things to shake things up and keep people
interested.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Moesha'' has retained most of its audience this season, but
the network, which is owned by Viacom and Chris-Craft Industries,
had hoped it would grow, especially because a spin-off show, ``The
Parkers,'' which follows it on Monday nights, has recorded even
better ratings than ``Moesha'' so far this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moesha'' has also endured some production delays because of
the illness of its star, the popular singer Brandy, who was
suffering from what the network said was dehydration. Ms. Edmonds
said Brandy had returned to work last week ``and she's much
better.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been reports about possible pressure by the network
to take ``Moesha'' in directions at odds with its earlier image as
a wholesome show about middle-class black family life. But Ms.
Edmonds said, ``We all came to the show partly because of the
integrity it has exhibited, and we intend to uphold that
integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Spears has declined to comment on the reasons she was
dismissed. Numerous attempts to reach her through her agent and
lawyer were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Among the changes suggested by UPN executives was a plot that
would involve one of the characters joining a high school gang and
acquiring a gun that would lead to an accidental shooting. Ms.
Edmonds said the details of the possible gang episode had not been
``fully decided.''
</P>
<P>
   A new character, played by Brandy's brother Ray J., was added
last year. He is playing Moesha's cousin. In another possible
episode, the cousin character may be revealed to be the
illegitimate son of Moesha's father. Again Ms. Edmonds said the
specifics of that story remain to be worked out.

   Hit TV Quiz Show Spawns a Popular Book
</P>
<P>
   Since Walt Disney's Hyperion moved in last month with its
corporate cousin, ABC, the television network and the publisher
have become as cozy and warm as a cup of cocoa.
</P>
<P>
   Hyperion just hit the lottery with its bet that thousands of
living-room players of ABC's popular quiz show, ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire,'' would pay $10.95 for an official game handbook of
answers to perilous questions.
</P>
<P>
   The show's writers developed the mock questions for the book.
The game's host, Regis Philbin, also did his share for Disney's
literary side by holding up the handbook during one of the shows. A
beaming Philbin appears on the cover with a green fan of cash and
the promise to deliver ``everything you need to practice, play, and
win!''
</P>
<P>
   The title is one of those tantalizing examples of synergy that
Hyperion was hoping would evolve with its move from its Manhattan
offices on Fifth Avenue to ABC's offices at 77 West 66th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Within the last seven days, Hyperion has gone back to press four
times to publish more than 200,000 copies of the quiz-show guide.
It had originally printed 50,000 copies, but quickly realized that
would not meet demand, said Robert S. Miller, Hyperion's managing
director.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently there are plenty of desperate readers eager to ponder
such questions as ``In Mozart's opera `Don Giovanni' how many
lovers does Leporello claim Don Giovanni has had in Spain?''
</P>
<P>
   (a) 156 (b) 849 (c) 1,003 (d) 3,727
</P>
<P>
   Final answer? Is that really your final answer? (c).
</P>
<P>
   The book, which is rather slim on text, is dominated by mock
questions from the $100 range to $1 million that are similar to
those that real contestants can answer on the show with occasional
``lifeline'' help from the audience or a friend. Miller advised
playing practice games at home, but warned with Regis-like tension
in his voice that readers should use the literary lifeline _ the
answer key _ wisely.
</P>
<P>
   The guidebook is just one example of the growing links between
Hyperion and Disney-owned television programming. Earlier this
year, Hyperion created a best-selling millennium book of sports
events, ``ESPN SportsCentury,'' which was inspired by a series of
ESPN shows.
</P>
<P>
   Still to come is a ``Good Morning America Cut the Calories
Cookbook'' _ a set of viewer recipes like Nonna's raw apple cake or
crepes bombe Nanette. In May, Hyperion will publish an
inspirational guide by the ABC correspondent Nancy Snyderman called
``Necessary Journeys: Letting Ourselves Learn From Life.''

   Publishing Gathering to Return to New York
</P>
<P>
   After more than a decade's absence from the capital of
publishing, the largest book convention in the United States will
apparently return to New York in 2002 for its annual exhibition,
which draws more than 21,000 visitors.
</P>
<P>
   BookExpo America _ a convention rite of passage for booksellers,
publishers and agents _ will take place in May 2002 at the Jacob K.
Javits Convention Center and will return to New York three years
later in June 2005, said Courtney Muller, the show manager for the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Muller said an oral agreement was struck with the Javits
center on Friday, but even so, Javits center executives were
reluctant to say much about the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is Javits' policy not to comment publicly on any event
until we have a signed agreement,'' said Mike Eisgrau, director of
public affairs for the convention center. ``That has not yet
happened. When and if that does happen, I'm sure we'll be delighted
to welcome a very big and successful new show to the center.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time the convention was held in New York was 1991, when
it was organized by the American Booksellers Association, the trade
group that later sold the exhibition to Association Expositions and
Services, a division of Reed Exhibition Cos.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is a center of publishing activity, and it's only
appropriate that we include it in our plans for the future,'' Ms.
Muller said. She said the convention's long hiatus from New York
was because of a shortage of space at the Javits center.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, the convention couldn't fit there, but in the last
18 months the Javits center has used a parking lot and built over
it so there is additional space that we can use now for our
autographing area for authors,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the convention was in Los Angeles, but previously it
was held in Chicago, where it will be held next June and in 2001
and 2004.

   Imagine what would happen if the people who made the old Miller
Lite commercials tried their magic on newspaper stocks. The script
might go something like this:
</P>
<P>
   (Two hotshot analysts are arguing.)
</P>
<P>
   ANALYST A: Newspapers are a stodgy cyclical business!
</P>
<P>
   ANALYST B: Newspapers are a sexy Internet business!
</P>
<P>
   ANALYST A: Stodgy!
</P>
<P>
   ANALYST B: Sexy!
</P>
<P>
   (Enter soothing portfolio manager.)
</P>
<P>
   PORTFOLIO MANAGER: Relax, folks. Newspaper companies are stodgy
and sexy. They're two, two, two stocks in one.
</P>
<P>
   That more or less describes events last week, when newspaper
companies' stocks jumped 10 percent or more. The numbers seemed to
please both those who cared about cyclical trends and those
enamored of Internet highfliers.
</P>
<P>
   Company by company, the executives reported to investors at
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette's media conference that the stodgy
cyclical business was thriving. And company by company, they
reported that revenues from their Internet properties were growing
exponentially and indicated levels of investment in online
properties that reflected their commitment to the new online
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street's reaction could be seen in the way the stock prices
climbed in the week. Dow Jones &AMP; Co. ended the week with its stock
price at $69.0625, a gain of 42 percent since the beginning of
January and 10.5 percent for the week. The New York Times Co.'s
stock closed on Friday at $46.4375, up 12 percent for the week and
35 percent for the year. And the Tribune Co.'s stock closed at $57,
up 14 percent for the week and 71 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line on 1999 for newspapers is that the Internet
has gone from a negative to a positive,'' said Douglas Arthur, an
industry analyst with Morgan Stanley. Pointing to the dot-com
advertising bounty in newspapers, he said the Internet was driving
ad revenues. ``It's reaffirming the role of newspapers as an ad
medium,'' he said, ``and the franchise value of the content that
newspapers have.'' A year ago, he added, ``there was this really
negative karma around the newspaper stocks, even though business
was good.'' Not now.
</P>
<P>
   Just to underline the point, the Standard &AMP; Poor's newspaper
publishing index, which in the first quarter languished while
Internet stocks soared, no longer moves in a different direction
than do the indexes of online stocks. The newspaper index has
climbed 31 percent since the beginning of the year, and last week,
when it gained 7.3 percent, it was moving roughly in tandem with
TheStreet.com's index of Internet stocks, which moved up 9.8
percent last week.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the new synchronicity between newspaper and Internet
stocks reflects the Internet advertising. ``These dot-coms take
this money, and they don't build factories, they build audiences,''
said Douglas Arthur, an analyst with Morgan Stanley. ``They have to
build them through mass media. So newspapers are re-emerging on a
secular basis as a very effective mass media in local markets.''
</P>
<P>
   USA Today, the Gannett Co.'s flagship, which now has the highest
circulation in the industry, ``is getting the highest share of
print dot-com spending,'' Lauren Rich Fine, an analyst for Merrill
Lynch, wrote. That newspaper's advertising revenue through November
was up 16 percent, compared with a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But other industries were spending on newspapers as well.
Financial advertising helped push advertising volume in Dow Jones'
Wall Street Journal up 30.5 percent in November, compared with the
1998 month.
</P>
<P>
   For the first 11 months of the year, the Journal's advertising
volume was up 15.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising revenue at The New York Times was up 20.7 percent in
November, compared with November 1998, and 10.6 percent for the
year to date. USA Today has brought in 16 percent more revenue in
1999 than it did for the comparable period in 1998. At The Los
Angeles Times, owned by the Times Mirror Co., ad revenue increased
an average 9 percent in October and November over the comparable
1998 period.
</P>
<P>
   And at Knight Ridder's San Jose Mercury News, one of the
industry's most disturbing trends _ the loss of high-margin
help-wanted classified ads, apparently to competing Internet sites
_ reversed itself in the second half of 1999. Help-wanted revenues
were up 25 percent in October and 21 percent in November, compared
with those months in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   So there is good news from a cyclical point of view. But for
those who use Internet math, which counts increasing revenues as a
plus (for obvious reasons) and increasing losses as a plus (because
they reflect a degree of commitment to new technologies and new
markets), the numbers were even better.
</P>
<P>
   Knight Ridder executives announced that it would consolidate its
Internet properties into a unit called KnightRidder.com, to be
managed separately from its newspapers and may compete with them
for advertising. Dow Jones executives indicated they expected
online businesses to generate $150 million in revenue this year.
</P>
<P>
   Gannett executives said they expected $40 million in Internet
revenues in 1999, and said that 15 of its sites, including
usatoday.com, the most-visited newspaper Web site, were running
profits for the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Times Co.'s online unit, Times Company Digital, is expected
to post revenues of $29 million to $31 million in 1999 and to incur
operating losses of $20 million to $22 million. Next year,
executives said, revenue is expected to reach $49 million, and
losses $40 million to $60 million.

A HIGH-ENERGY FEVER IS REVISITED 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JACK ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bill T. Jones sent dancers off on a new trip through
an old swamp last Friday night. The expedition proved worth
watching.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983 Jones choreographed a dance called ``Fever Swamp'' for
the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. Last Friday the company
offered a work of that same name at City Center. But it wasn't
really the same dance, even though both productions were virtuosic,
high-energy pieces performed to a recording of a cheerfully
chugging composition by Peter Gordon called ``Intervallic
Expansion.''
</P>
<P>
   What made the old ``Fever Swamp'' odd as well as exciting was
that its energy had an edge of seemingly unmotivated melodramatic
tension that made it difficult to determine what Jones intended his
choreographic tone to be. There is no such aesthetic murkiness in
the new production. It's all feverish fun.
</P>
<P>
   In staging his revised version, Jones was aided by a creative
team that included Bjorn Amelan as producer and Janet Wong as
assistant. It began with a bang as dancers hopped and kicked their
way in, then ran and bounced about the stage. At one point they
vanished behind shimmering silver curtains designed by Bill Katz,
only to explode through them back into view again. Later those
curtains rose into the air, making the stage seem a vast expanse,
glowing with lighting designed by Robert Wierzel.
</P>
<P>
   One fascinating difference between the old and new productions
involved casting. The 1983 version was entirely for men. Although
the new one had five men (Matthew Rushing, Glenn A. Sims, Jeffrey
Gerodias, Clifton Brown and Richard Witter), there was also a
woman, Dwana Adiaha Smallwood. Yet Jones' choreography set up no
rigid distinctions between specifically male and female types of
movement. All the people in this swamp were equals, performing the
same steps with the same vitality and wearing similar loose-fitting
costumes by Liz Prince. As the dancers clapped and hopped happily
in circles in the work's final moments, one knew that Jones' second
thoughts about ``Fever Swamp'' were good ones.
</P>
<P>
   The evening was also notable for Renee Robinson's interpretation
of ``Cry,'' Alvin Ailey's tribute to the indomitability of black
women. There were times when the archetypal figure Ms. Robinson
portrayed in this solo was bent to the earth in sorrow. But Ms.
Robinson convincingly revealed that this woman was capable of
rising up with courage and determination.
</P>
<P>
   The program also included repeat performances of ``Lettres
d'Amour'' and ``Revelations.''

XEROX IS CLAMPING DOWN ON COUNTERFEIT SUPPLIES 
NEW RATINGS SITE TAKES SPELLING ERROR IN STRIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis., Pa.)  (jw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Step aside, Magnum. Make way for Xerox, private investigator.
</P>
<P>
   Seems the problem of counterfeit supplies _ cartridges, toners,
all those deliciously high-margin items that users of printers and
copiers must replace again and again _ has escalated badly of late.
A big factor is the ease with which counterfeiters can sell their
wares on the Internet. And Xerox does not cotton to counterfeiters.
</P>
<P>
   The company has been devoting ``significant time and resources''
to ferreting out people who make illegal copies of its copier
products, said William Steenburgh, vice president for Xerox's
consumable supplies business. Acting on tips from outsiders as well
as on information developed by its own security specialists, Xerox
has been running makeshift sting operations throughout the country,
buying products it suspects to be counterfeit and testing them in
its labs.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, they turn out to be the genuine article, distributed
through the hated but legal gray market. But often, they turn out
to be phonies, at which point Xerox pulls in local police officials
and even federal agents.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, one such operation in Milwaukee turned up
47,000 cardboard boxes, complete with Xerox's packaging codes and
logos, that could have held $8 million worth of products. The
packages were seized, as were the box maker's equipment.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Xerox and police officials presided over the
prearranged surrender of Robert Leonard, president of Alberta
International, a wholesale computer supplier in Pittsburgh whose
records showed he had sold $30,000 of phony Xerox cartridges. Xerox
now has a sting operation on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   A lot is at stake. According to William Duffy, president of the
Imaging Supplies Coalition, an industry group formed to battle
counterfeiting, the supplies business has quintupled in the last
decade, to $25 billion worldwide. He figures the combination of
counterfeiting, fraudulent telemarketing and trademark infringement
is costing Xerox and other document processing companies nearly $1
billion a year. ``Two years ago it would have been half this,''
Duffy said.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   NEW RATINGS SITE TAKES SPELLING ERROR IN STRIDE
</P>
<P>
   Judge not, lest ye be judged.
</P>
<P>
   A new shopping-comparison site called EWonders.com started up
last week. The site is meant to guide online shoppers by rating
e-tailing Web sites on various characteristics, like prices,
product selection and, of all things, spelling and grammar.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, the EWonders Web site misspelled ``grammar'' _
writing it ``grammer.'' EWonders fixed the mistake, after a
reporter pointed it out.
</P>
<P>
   Masood Faisal, an EWonders vice president, said the misspelling
occurred when the site transferred material from an affiliated
site, RatingWonders.com. ``It was spelled correctly on that site,''
he said, ``but somehow it was changed in the transmission.''
</P>
<P>
   Faisal took the incident in stride, noting that the the new site
had been developed in a mere 17 days. When EWonders scans the text
of other sites, he said, his company will use a spell checker.

NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINE SAYS OUTLOOK IS GOOD
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Officials of the Norwegian Cruise Line, who have rejected a $1.7
billion takeover bid by the Carnival Corp., disclosed a rosy
financial outlook on Friday in what analysts said was an appeal to
shareholders tempted by the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Repeating their contention that the bid was too low, the
officials called it ``totally opportunistic.'' They said, however,
that they were open to an alliance or even a higher offer, if not
from Carnival then from another suitor.
</P>
<P>
   And in response to a question during a teleconference from Oslo,
the corporate headquarters of NCL Holding ASA, Norwegian Cruise
Line's parent company, they said they had held talks with other
interested parties, including Star Cruises of Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   NCL declined to name the other suitors or to elaborate on talks
with Star.
</P>
<P>
   Since Carnival made its surprise offer last week, which NCL
management and major stockholders promptly rejected, NCL shares
have risen from 24.9 kroner, or $3.12, to 33.6 kroner, or $4.21.
</P>
<P>
   Its American depository receipts closed up 12.5 cents, to
$16.875 Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, Carnival shares were
unchanged, at $46.25, also on the Big Board.
</P>
<P>
   NCL executives, including Geir Aune, its chief executive, and
Kristian Semb, its chairman, said in the telephone conference that
NCL's financial position was strengthening.
</P>
<P>
   Pretax profit next year, the company said, is projected at $92
million, up from $40 million this year. That projection, they said,
is ``the reason Carnival is rushing ahead with this offer'' before
others know about it.
</P>
<P>
   The company also forecast an operating profit before
depreciation and charter operations of $236 million and a profit
before tax of $92 million. Its forecasts, it said, are based on
strong advance bookings for next year and higher revenue per
available passenger day _ $75 for the first quarter of 2000,
compared with $65 for the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   But a report six weeks ago by Lezard Freres &AMP; Co. projected
NCL's pretax income next year at $65.4 million and its net income
at $47.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Carnival, the No. 1 cruise line with a market share of 40
percent, said last week that it would not raise its offer for
Norwegian Cruise, the fourth-largest cruise company. Sunday, it
said it had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   But Joyce Minor, the cruise industry analyst with Lehman
Brothers, said, ``Investors need to know whether there's a real
alternative bid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is,'' she added, `` and it's on the table, Carnival
will have a chance to respond.''

`SIDE SHOW' TWINS REUNITE IN `THE DEAD' 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Emily Skinner and Alice Ripley can be excused for
sharing a bit of an identity crisis. It's not that they look alike,
sound alike or even dress alike. Ms. Ripley has honey blonde hair,
while Ms. Skinner's is closer to sunshine. And though both women
have blue eyes, you'd never think their genes had jumped from the
same pool.
</P>
<P>
   Still, almost every day someone, somewhere, calls one of them by
the other woman's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you never call me Emily,'' Ms. Ripley announces to a
reporter, ``you'll be my favorite person ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Such confusion is not inexplicable. After all, it was just two
years ago that Ms. Skinner and Ms. Ripley burst onto Broadway
literally connected at the hip.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion, of course, was ``Side Show,'' the ill-fated
musical about Daisy and Violet Hilton, conjoined twins and
Depression-era vaudevillians whose physical deformity failed to
hide their humanity or, apparently, their deep urge to belt out a
tune. The actresses earned a joint Tony nomination for playing
Daisy and Violet, side by side.
</P>
<P>
   It was, as they say, a bonding experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``How did we get to know one another?'' Ms. Skinner said with a
smile. ``When you have your backside plastered to another girl's
for eight hours a day, it's sort of natural.''
</P>
<P>
   Though ``Side Show'' lasted only seven weeks, the Broadway
community's mental connection between Ms. Skinner and Ms. Ripley
has endured. And that association is likely to intensify now that
the two find themselves on Broadway again in ``James Joyce's `The
Dead,''' the musical adaptation of the Joyce short story that
begins a limited engagement at the Belasco Theater on Tuesday
night..
</P>
<P>
   The end result of which is that the former twins are once again
sharing a dressing room, albeit with a little more room to breathe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing,'' said Ms. Skinner, pointing to Ms. Ripley's
left cheek. ``I've only ever seen that side of her face.''
</P>
<P>
   The roles the women play in ``The Dead'' are a far cry from
their ``Side Show'' personae. Ms. Ripley plays Miss Molly Ivors, a
spunky Irish lass whose flirtation raises the body temperature of
Gabriel Conroy, the play's central character, played by Christopher
Walken.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Skinner, meanwhile, is Mary Jane, a kindly niece whose
Christmas celebration sets the scene for the play. The two
characters never speak directly to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the two women see themselves, as actresses, falling
into distinctly different categories. Ms. Skinner said that Ms.
Ripley was a ``classic young leading lady'' with high, angular
cheekbones and a bright, brassy voice that recalls Barbara Cook or
Shirley Jones. (This description elicited a large ``Awwww'' from a
grateful Ms. Ripley.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Skinner, meanwhile, is the more rosy-cheeked of the two, the
possessor of a beaming smile and a voice that Ms. Ripley described
as ``like a warm reed instrument.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beautiful,'' Ms. Ripley said. ``I envy her.''
</P>
<P>
   The two have put their voices to work in two albums of duets and
solo versions of songs drawn from Broadway shows.
</P>
<P>
   The latest, ``Unsuspecting Hearts'' (Varese Sarabande), was
released in September and features 15 songs, including ``She's
Gone,'' which was cut from ``Side Show,'' and the album's title
song, which was drawn from the astoundingly unsuccessful musical
version of ``Carrie.''
</P>
<P>
   Their first album, ``Duets'' (Varese Sarabande), was released in
1998 and is the label's third-highest-selling Broadway album ever.
</P>
<P>
   Both recordings were presented in a way that seemed geared to
cash in on their Siamese past. The cover of ``Unsuspecting Hearts''
shows the two women wrapped in a seamless red blanket, their
shoulders nearly blended together. For ``Duets,'' their faces are
pressed cheek-to-cheek.
</P>
<P>
   Still, their appearance together in ``The Dead,'' which is
transferring from Playwrights Horizons, was almost accidental. Ms.
Ripley's part was one of the first cast, said the producer, Gregory
Mosher, while Ms. Skinner's was one of the last.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I realized the whole `Side Show' connection, I thought,
`Wow, what a brilliant idea,''' Mosher said. ``Then I thought, `Oh,
no, do they like one another?' I mean, sharing a body part could
breed the greatest of friends or someone you really, really don't
want to see a lot of.''
</P>
<P>
   The reminders of their shared past are constant. Casting agents
call for one, wanting the other. Schedule changes are called in to
Ms. Skinner and expected to be passed on to Ms. Ripley. Neither set
of parents has slipped yet, but it seems only a matter of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've warned my husband,'' Ms. Ripley said.
</P>
<P>
   The two actresses have become good friends, though they say a
deeper, more normal friendship blossomed only  &UR; after  &LR; the pressure
of ``Side Show'' had faded.
</P>
<P>
   ``People used to ask us, `So do you guys hang out together?'''
Ms. Skinner said. ``I mean, the last thing we want to do after
being stuck together is be like, `Hey, want to get our nails
done?'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ripley continued, ``What's nice about `The Dead' is that it
lets us actually get to know one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Skinner added: ``That's lovely you felt that way, but I felt
I knew you before. I knew everything I should know, and everything
I shouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The women do display an uncanny, almost sisterly talent for
finishing each other's sentences, and enough spunk to tease each
other into laughter. Asked how they became actresses, Ms. Skinner
and Ms. Ripley answered like this:
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Skinner: ``I've never really had any other life dream or
plan than to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ripley: ``Good thing it worked out for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Skinner: ``I know. Really.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ripley: ``You could've ended up working at the 7-Eleven.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Skinner: ``Easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Skinner, a native of Richmond, Va., who said she was born to
two ``very normal people,'' was a child actress who earned her
Equity card, a badge of professionalism, at the age of 12. She has
one sister, Eliza.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ripley, meanwhile, comes from a large family, 11 children in
all, and spent her childhood in several cities in Ohio. Her
professional training came at Kent State University. After working
as an actress in San Diego, she moved to Nashville to pursue a
singing career. Instead she found her husband, Shannon Ford, a jazz
and rock drummer.
</P>
<P>
   Both women arrived in New York in 1992 and quickly found work,
with Ms. Skinner landing in a workshop of ``Jekyll and Hyde'' and
Ms. Ripley taking an understudy role on Broadway in ``The Who's
`Tommy.'''
</P>
<P>
   Their collective break came in 1996, when ``Side Show,'' which
was then called the ``The Song of the Siamese Twins,'' was in
workshops. Ms. Skinner had played Daisy in several early readings,
but her Violets kept wilting away. Finally the creative team
brought in Ms. Ripley for an audition. The effect of their voices
together _ ``the blend,'' as Robert Longbottom, the director, put
it _ was immediate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really finished each other,'' Longbottom said.
``Everybody in the room just knew: there it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite good reviews and the Tony nomination, ``Side Show''
proved to have less presence than Ms. Skinner and Ms. Ripley. Since
then Ms. Ripley has done a stint as Fantine in ``Les Miserables,''
while Ms. Skinner has had roles in regional theater productions of
``Jesus Christ Superstar'' and ``Working.''
</P>
<P>
   And while the name switch and identity blend may get a little
tiresome, Ms. Ripley and Ms. Skinner say, in their own way, that
they enjoy each other's company.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ripley: ``I'm sort of like, I'm to the point, it's
like....'' Ms. Skinner: ``There could be worse people to be linked
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ripley: ``Exactly.''

ESSAY WINNER FROM MOSCOW, WITH TIME ON HER HANDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ An international essay contest announced two years ago
in Weimar, Germany, may have seemed like a brave effort to revive a
revered 18th-century tradition. But it turned out that essay
writers around the world were just waiting for the call. When the
deadline for submissions came a year ago, 2,481 writers from 123
countries had presented lengthy papers on the millennial theme:
``Liberating the Past From the Future? Liberating the Future From
the Past?''
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend's announcement of the results of the competition
brought yet another surprise. It was not a German philosophy
professor with time on his hands who won the 50,000-mark ($26,300)
first prize. It was Iveta Gerasimchuk, a 20-year-old student from
Moscow, whose essay, ``Dictionary of Winds,'' was first chosen from
among 306 Russian-language submissions and was then picked by a
seven-member jury from among 43 finalists.
</P>
<P>
   The competition was organized by a committee called Weimar 1999
and Lettre International, a European literary magazine, to
celebrate Weimar's selection as the European Cultural Capital for
1999. The simple idea nonetheless involved mobilizing an army of
intellectuals (113 of them proposed topics for the essay), jury
members for each of the seven language groups (German, English,
French, Spanish, Russian, Chinese and Arabic), translators and a
final jury.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 2,481 essays submitted, 2,203 met the criteria for the
competition. All were then given numbers, with the identity of each
author revealed only after the results were in. Most papers came
from Germany (630), with Russia (232) and the United States (228)
some distance behind. France (115) also showed interest, followed
by Japan (91), Switzerland (60), Spain (55) and Argentina (54).
Still, it is hard to know whether these numbers reflect
intellectual standards or simply greater awareness of the existence
of the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps unexpectedly, given Germany's philosophical tradition,
no Germans were among the 10 award winners, who included four
Americans, two Russians, two Chinese, one Yugoslav and one
Frenchman. All 10 were given scholarships to study for six months
in Germany, while three runners-up were also given monetary prizes:
30,000 marks ($15,800) went to Louis E. Wolcher, professor of law
at the University of Washington School of Law in Seattle, for his
essay, ``Time's Language''; and 20,000 marks ($10,500) were shared
by Velimir Curgus Kazimir, a Yugoslav writer, and Christophe
Wall-Romana, a Paris-born American poet and essayist.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gerasimchuk, who was not only the youngest but also the only
woman among the top 10 essayists, won several writing contests
while attending school in her hometown, Samara, 600 miles southeast
of Moscow. A 1996 contest earned her a place in Moscow's
prestigious State University of International Relations, where she
specializes in South Africa (she learned both English and
Afrikaans) and international environmental policy. She has also
been invited to join a research team at the Academy of Sciences in
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Her winning 49-page essay is an intellectual tour de force in
which, by defining 61 words listed alphabetically, she meditates on
time through prisms of philosophy, mythology, history, science,
mathematics and literature. More specifically, she divides
interpreters of time between ``anemophiles'' _ literally, lovers of
wind _ who believe time is infinite and have no interest in the
past, and ``chronists,'' who believe time is a gift that should not
be wasted and are sure only of the past. Ms. Gerasimchuk herself,
though, suggests mischievously that both are wrong.
</P>
<P>
   CHASING ANSWERS TO TIMELESS QUESTIONS
</P>
<P>
   Here is an excerpt from the introduction to Iveta Gerasimchuk's
prize-winning essay, ``Dictionary of Winds,'' in an international
essay contest in Weimar, Germany, built around the topic
``Liberating the Past From the Future? Liberating the Future From
the Past?''
</P>
<P>
   The ancients understood that it is impossible to separate one
day from the next, one year from the next. It is impossible to
liberate the past from the future, and the future from the past, in
the same way that it is impossible to liberate the right hand from
the left and the left from the right. And herein lies the highest
idea of the Lord. To divide time meant to destroy it, as Zeno of
Elea demonstrated in the very same chase after answers to the
unresolved questions.
</P>
<P>
   However, Zeno of Elea was only one of many. In any human society
there are always people inclined to undertake a similar vivisection
of time. Thank God that they have never managed to do so
successfully.
</P>
<P>
   Some, having armed themselves with Homer's lotus-eaters, strive
to ``liberate'' the future from the past. The ``Dictionary of
Winds'' refers to them as ``anemophiles.'' They firmly believe that
time is infinite, and they are not interested in how much of it has
already passed; after all, there is no limit to infinity and there
is no limit to the changes of the world in it.
</P>
<P>
   Others value time as higher than everything else, or they
believe that it is a gift of God and to waste it thoughtlessly is
the greatest sin. The ``Dictionary of Winds'' refers to them as
``chronists.'' Chronists are not sure of the future, nor are they
sure that time is infinite. However, they are sure of the past, and
hence strive even more to liberate the past from the future, which
brings changes.
</P>
<P>
   Anemophiles and chronists live together _ in the real world and
in the world of the ``Dictionary of Winds,'' in each of us. They
love, suffer, pursue scholarly and other research, conduct
incessant arguments among themselves; in some there are no
vanquished or victors _ they all seek answers to the very same
questions posed so very long ago, sensing intuitively that these
answers exist. And they find them _ sooner or later. Often, what
they find does not satisfy them. They doubt and search again.

`WALTER BENJAMIN AT THE DAIRY QUEEN': A SEMINAL MOMENT AT A TEXAS
DRIVE-IN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(lb) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Writing is not often a profession passed down from generation to
generation, especially not in immigrant, raw-boned America, where
it took a long time for the cultural accretions to build to the
point where literature was a major activity. Perhaps for that
reason explanations of how writers became writers often involve
stories of long distances traveled from origin to fate.
</P>
<P>
   But even in a land of long distances, not many have traveled
quite as far as Larry McMurtry, the prolific author of two dozen
novels and books of essays, including ``The Last Picture Show,''
``Lonesome Dove'' and ``Terms of Endearment.''
</P>
<P>
   McMurtry's new memoir, ``Walter Benjamin at the Dairy Queen,''
makes much of distances _ psychological as well as geographical _
as he explains how he abandoned the cowboy life in Texas, where he
grew up, and became, as he puts it, a herder of words.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Benjamin, the German-Jewish literary critic and essayist
whose origins were as different from McMurtry's as they could
possibly be, plays the role of cultural foil here. He never went to
the Dairy Queen in Archer City, Texas, where McMurtry first read
him in 1980. But McMurtry's meeting with Benjamin's mind in the
Texas flatlands is emblematic of the mysteriousness of personal
outcomes, and in that way Benjamin serves as an evocative point of
departure for McMurtry's examination of his own literary itinerary.
</P>
<P>
   This is an engaging idea, and McMurtry is an engaging writer.
Still, his memoir is not easy to get a bead on. It meanders; it
picks up themes and then picks up other themes, but it often
doesn't get to a point.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin, as McMurtry well knows, was fascinated by the flaneur,
the person who browsed through the Parisian shopping arcades that
for Benjamin epitomized urban commercialism. McMurtry is a sort of
flaneur through the arcades of his own life and career.
</P>
<P>
   This has its charms, and occasionally, as with McMurtry's riffs
on the very brief, mostly mythic history of cowboys in American
life, it is more than charming; it is illuminating. But McMurtry's
memoir never sheds its quality of drift, and it leaves the reader
longing for a stronger theme, greater narrative punch.
</P>
<P>
   McMurtry begins with his first reading of Benjamin at the Dairy
Queen while groups of working-class locals ``formed and reformed,
like drifting clouds.'' The particular essay that caught McMurtry's
eye was ``The Storyteller,'' in which Benjamin offers his
explanation for what McMurtry calls the ``diminution of the power
of oral narrative in our 20th-century lives.''
</P>
<P>
   McMurtry quotes several passages from Benjamin (passages whose
meaning is elusive) and goes on to react to those passages. He
wonders, for example, what Benjamin, who came from the culturally
dense environs of Europe, would make of the ``unpeopled horizons,''
the vast emptiness of Texas where McMurtry's grandparents came as
pioneers in the late 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``My question to Walter Benjamin would be, what kind of stories
arise in a place where nothing has ever happened except, of course,
the vagaries and vicissitudes of individual life?'' McMurtry
writes. He goes on to weave some recollections of the spare
tragedies that the loneliness of Texas produced and that McMurtry
remembers from childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Then he returns to Benjamin: ``The birthplace of the novel is
the solitary individual, who is no longer able to express himself
by giving examples of his more important concerns, is himself
uncounseled, and cannot counsel others.'' From there McMurtry asks,
``Does mere human memory, the soil that nourishes storytelling,
still have any use at all?''
</P>
<P>
   All of this relates to McMurtry's larger question, namely how
someone like him, growing up in a place where ``nothing of
historical or cultural consequence had ever happened,'' became a
novelist. It is a good question, and McMurtry goes on to recount
the stages in his career. But this to-ing and fro-ing from obscure
shards of literary theory to the barrenness of Texas has a whiff of
genial pretentiousness about it.
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be some deeper point here than the mere fact that
being from Berlin and being from Archer City, Texas, are different,
but what that profounder point is exactly remains buried in
McMurtry's epigrammatic browsings.
</P>
<P>
   He tells some savory tales as his memoir proceeds, and these
provide the best passages in this slender book. His memories of his
grandparents, of his parents and of his boyhood life as an
unenthusiastic and lackluster cowboy have a flavorful and resonant
quality, as do his reflections on the persistence of what he sees
as a Western myth.
</P>
<P>
   ``What rodeos, movies, Western art and pulp fiction all miss,''
he writes, ``is the overwhelming loneliness of the westering
experience.'' He continues: ``Somehow the outlaw came to stand for
this solitary Westerner _ the man who has no ties because he kills.
More common was the man who had no ties because he would rather
work and keep working.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Walter Benjamin at the Dairy Queen'' has in general more
drift than purpose. McMurtry intersperses his charming biographical
reflections with more mediocre philosophizing: on his view, for
example, that ``real curiosity now gets little chance to develop _
it's smothered with information before it can draw a natural
breath.''
</P>
<P>
   He warns us in a meandering chapter on his career as a used-book
dealer that the subject might be interesting only to readers who
share McMurtry's antiquarian fascination, and this essay indicates
that the warning is justified.
</P>
<P>
   McMurtry ends with a chapter titled ``The End of the Cowboy _
The End of Fiction,'' in which he reflects variously on Benjamin
again, on the dizzying rapidity of change in the West and,
elegiacally, on growing old as a writer in American today.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is all sparks, yet the sparks rarely produce a steady
flame,'' he writes about Benjamin. It is a perceptive dollop of
literary criticism, but it is one that applies to McMurtry's
memoir, which has its aphoristic and conversational moments but
remains too casually fragmentary to produce the needed unwavering
beam of light.

 THE WORKS OF COMPOSER GEORGE PERLE COME OF AGE  (jw) 
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Too few composers live to enjoy the kind of respect
and acclaim that fell to George Perle last week at Merkin Concert
Hall in Manhattan. Perle turns 85 next year, and this was an early
tribute. Seven fine pianists, ranging in age from 21-year-old
Steven Beck to Beck's teacher, Seymour Lipkin, 72, played eight of
Perle's formidable works for solo piano.
</P>
<P>
   True, many of Perle's colleagues and other musical people were
in the audience last Monday night. But the enthusiastic response
seemed a genuine expression of excitement about the music, not an
obligatory gesture. Larger public acclaim for Perle's music, at
once challenging and appealing, is starting to happen. Perhaps his
time has arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Perle was one of the first American composers to become
enthralled with the music of the Second Viennese School:
Schoenberg, Webern and Berg. But he has never been a strict 12-tone
composer. He uses the 12 tones in a way similar to the Serialists,
often devising rows and pitch patterns. The notes zigzag in his
pieces and discombobulate the ear, just as in 12-tone works.
</P>
<P>
   But his language is grounded in his own equivalent of tonality,
with harmonic touch points, recurring uses of thematic intervals
and repetition of rhythmic patterns, which combine to give the
listener something to hold on to. Perle has never believed that
complexity must be synonymous with obscurity. There is a wonderful
lucidity about his music, even at its most complex. And unlike the
Viennese forefathers, he is no angst-ridden heavy. Rather he is an
optimistic urban American and his music abounds in snappy rhythmic
energy and wit.
</P>
<P>
   In Six Celebratory Inventions (1995), played brilliantly by
Russell Sherman, Perle revealed his ability to evoke character. For
example ``Gunther Schuller at 70'' is pensive and rigorous;
``Leonard Bernstein at 70'' is full of streets-of-New York
exuberance.
</P>
<P>
   Every piece played was rewarding. Esther Budiardjo gave a
compelling performance of the Ballade (1981), a rhapsodic work in
homage to the 19th-century Romantic piano music. Beck gave an
invigorating account of the spirited Toccata (1976). Lipkin was
impressive in the Short Sonata (1964), which, though not long, is
packed with materials. Eliza Garth gave a sensitive, supple reading
of the imaginative Suite in C (1970). Michael Boriskin played
dazzling renditions of the Six Etudes (1976) and the Six New Etudes
(1984).
</P>
<P>
   Leon Fleisher gave the first performance of ``Musical
Offerings'' (1998), for left hand alone, musical portraits of three
friends of the composer-pianist from their days at the Tanglewood
Music Center: Richard Ortner and Dan Gustin, who were
administrators there, and the pianist Gilbert Kalish, who was
chairman of the faculty. The piece now seems an homage to three
people who were casualties of Seiji Ozawa's controversial shake-up
of that summer training institute two years ago, when Fleisher was
its artistic director. Fleisher and Kalish resigned in protest
after Ozawa's changes.
</P>
<P>
   Those thoughts were banished, though, by Fleisher's elegant
performance of Perle's riveting short works, delivered with a
palpable sense of purpose. The occasion warranted it.

ENTERTAINMENT INTERNET VENTURE GETS A CHIEF 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD, Dec. 12 _ Kenneth P. Wong, former president of Walt
Disney Imagineering, Disney's technology research and development
unit, has been named chairman and chief executive of Pop.com, the
recently announced collaboration between Dreamworks SKG and Imagine
Entertainment to create and distribute entertainment on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Pop.com, which is expected to begin in the spring, will offer
three- to-six minute segments that it calls ``pops,'' a combination
of digital films, animation, live events and interactive games.
Because it was formed by prominent Hollywood artists and executives
_ Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen of
Dreamworks and Ron Howard and Brian Grazer of Imagine _ and because
it is being largely financed by Paul G. Allen's Vulcan Ventures,
Pop.com fast became one of the most visible attempts in Hollywood
to come to terms with entertainment in the digital age.
</P>
<P>
   Wong recently left Disney after an eight-year career that saw
him rise from senior vice president at the Disney Development Co.
to executive vice president of the Imagineering division in 1995
and its president in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   As head of the division, he oversaw such projects as Disney's
recently opened Animal Kingdom in Florida, its Times Square
Studios, Tokyo DisneySea, Disney's California Adventure and two
Disney cruise ships.
</P>
<P>
   Wong was ``the architect of unprecedented growth at
Imagineering,'' Katzenberg said, ``and we are excited to work with
him to build Pop.com into a successful enterprise in the exploding
Internet marketplace.''

GM TO KEEP PLANTS RUNNING AT FULL SPEED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Despite slowing sales and bulging inventories of
unsold automobiles, General Motors Corp. announced Friday that it
planned to continue running its North American factories at close
to full speed through the first quarter of next year.
</P>
<P>
   GM said that it planned to build 1,501,000 cars, sport utility
vehicles, pickup trucks and vans during January, February and March
next year, compared with 1,506,000 during the first three months of
this year. Paul Ballew, GM's market analysis director, insisted
that the company could sell all the vehicles it planned to make
without resorting to the deep discounts that automakers have
traditionally used to clear out dealerships clogged with unwanted
models.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no need for us to open the floodgates on incentives,''
Ballew said. While the total number of vehicles is little changed,
GM plans to produce slightly more full-size pickups and sport
utilities, which have sold briskly for most of the last several
years, and slightly fewer cars, he added.
</P>
<P>
   But the industry's sales of full-size pickups and sport
utilities fell in November, possibly because of higher gasoline
prices, which make these vehicles more expensive to operate. Auto
analysts were skeptical that GM could sell so many vehicles in the
first quarter without cutting prices or increasing rebates and
cut-rate loans. Other manufacturers would be likely to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ward's Automotive Reports, a weekly industry
newsletter, the number of automobiles in GM's inventories rose 5.8
percent last month, and was up 25.6 percent from late November last
year. DaimlerChrysler's inventory climbed only 8.2 percent over the
last 12 months while Ford's inventory was up only 2.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Robinet, an auto production forecaster, said that GM's
output plans, while ambitious, could have been even more ambitious.
GM's capacity is slightly higher now than it was earlier this year
because fewer assembly plants are operating at partial capacity as
workers learn to build new models.

   SIERRA _ FREETOWN, Sierra Leone _ They are children, some as
young as 9 years old. Most have been abducted, then forced to fight
in a bitter and brutal civil war. Boys have been made to shoot
people with AK-47s and to cut off the hands of civilians, sometimes
members of their own families. Girls have been forced to be the
``wives'' of rebel soldiers, being raped at gunpoint, as one
14-year-old said in an interview, ``every day, every day.''
Sometimes, once these children escape the rebel force, their
families do not want them back. We look at the ways in which money
donated by Atlanta media mogul Ted Turner, through the U.N.
Foundation, is trying to get these kids back in school, get them
psychological care, negotiate their ways back into their villages
and families, and let them be kids once more. (Melvin, Atlanta

 &HT;    YO, ASIA! WHERE ARE YOU?
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ How many Americans do you think would know which
body of water separates the United States from Asia?
</P>
<P>
   In a survey released Sunday by the Asia Society, 810 adults and
1,012 college-bound high school students were offered four answers:
Atlantic Ocean, China Sea, Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that 68 percent of the adults and 74 percent of
the students correctly named the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   But 32 percent of adults and 26 percent of the students got it
wrong
</P>
<P>
   On the other 15 questions on a quiz to test their knowledge of
Asia both adults and students fared even worse. Most of the adults
missed half of the questions and most of the students were wrong on
nearly two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public lacks in-depth knowledge about Asia,'' concluded
the Asia Society, a nonprofit American organization based in New
York. It had hired Penn, Schoen &AMP; Berland Associates, which polls
for the White House, to administer the multiple-choice exams over
the phone in August and September. The poll's sampling margin of
error was 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A dinner Sunday was the first gathering of members of a new
commission formed by the society to design and supervise a $5
million campaign to increase Americans' knowledge of Asia through
``improvements in standards, lessons, teacher knowledge and
textbooks.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission of more than 30 educational, philanthropic,
corporate and state leaders is led by three co-chairs: Gov. Jim
Hunt of North Carolina, high school teacher Charlotte Mason of
Newton, Mass., and former Berkeley chancellor Chang-Lin Tien.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our kids know more than enough about Nintendo, the world's
largest selling video game, and far too little about India, the
world's largest democracy,'' said Hunt in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the test-takers thought the United States was the
largest democracy, although India has more than twice times as many
people.
</P>
<P>
   Those taking the multiple-choice phone test scored highest when
they were asked which of four countries _ India, Great Britain,
Philippines, United States _ ``has never elected a woman as head of
the government.'' But 79 percent of adults and 77 percent of
students who correctly chose the United States simply may have been
showing knowledge about their own country's presidents, rather than
Asian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Six out of every 10 in both groups knew that the ying-yang
symbol (that circle with an S-shaped curve separating the black and
white halves) symbolizes ``harmony of opposites.''
</P>
<P>
   The same number knew that it was was Gandhi, rather than Nehru,
Confucius or Pol Pot, who had strongly influenced civil rights
leader Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The Asia Society said the test groups did worst when asked which
of four countries _ China, United States, India, France _ ``has the
largest film industry in the world.'' Perhaps reflecting a U.S.
cultural emphasis upon exports and box-office grosses, only 8
percent of adults and 4 percent of students chose India, which in
most years produces more feature-length movies in more languages
than any other country.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows)
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the pollsters didn't even expect their own
phone-callers to know much about Asia. The script for the
questioners included this question: ``What is the capital of
Indonesia? Oo-lan bah-tore, Bang-cock, Ja-carta, Ma-nill-a?'' Sure
enough, even with those helpful pronunciations of Ulan Bator,
Bangkok, Jakarta and Manila, only 33 percent of adults and 22
percent of students picked Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   Just before taking the test, the respondents showed that
mediocre scores wouldn't surprise them: 45 percent of the adults
and 32 percent of the students admitted to being ``not very'' or
``not at all'' knowledgeable about Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Nor would the mediocre scores surprise the respondents, who
consisted of a sample that is probably within five percentage
points of correctly reflecting all adults and college-bound
students in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Would Asians do better than Americans on a test about Asia?
Probably. Yet three years ago, the newspaper Asahi Shimbun asked
2,307 Japanese what they mean by ``Asia.'' It turned out that 56
percent felt that India, Pakistan, Iran, Turkey and Saudi Arabia
are outside Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, computers wouldn't have aced the test either.
</P>
<P>
   An Internet site which offers to answer factual questions
(www.askjeeves.com) was asked the toughest of the 16 questions:
``Which of the following best characterized the Tokugawa period of
Japanese history? Fortified castle towns, many wars with China,
large navy, extensive network of foreign relations.''
</P>
<P>
   The first answer from AskJeeves was: ``I'm not sure I understood
your question correctly. Would you like me to check your
spelling?''
</P>
<P>
   The second answer provided a link to a site about Central Asia,
which is on the other side of China from Japan.

   Here are some books that young readers will enjoy:
</P>
<P>
   ``THE HAT: THE HEDGIE GIFT BOX'' &QL; 
Jan Brett &QL; 
(G.P. Putnam's Sons, $16.99) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brett's 1997 charmer about a cute little hedgehog is freshly
packaged into a gift box with a stuffed toy hedgehog just in time
for the Christmas season.
</P>
<P>
   The story centers on Hedgie, who crawls inside a sock that blows
off a clothesline. As the other animals poke fun at him, Hedgie
proudly proclaims that he's wearing a hat to keep warm in the snow.
Not a bad idea, they think. Soon the clothes line is stripped bare.
</P>
<P>
   Brett's colorful, realistic illustrations appeal to young
children. Her trademark border pictures add another layer of
meaning to the tale. For ages 2-5. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``FINGER PUPPET THEATER: THE THREE LITTLE PIGS'' &QL; 
Illustrated by Peter Stevenson (Scholastic, $13.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What a great idea! Finger puppets, board books and fairy tales _
all wrapped up in one package. Scholastic's Finger Puppet Theater
series also includes Hansel and Gretel, Goldilocks and the Little
Red Riding Hood.
</P>
<P>
   Four finger puppet characters come with each story, which
children act out using the sturdy board book pages as a stage.
Lively text and amusing pictures carry the plots.
</P>
<P>
   Young imaginations will soar! For ages 3-7. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``MORRIS'S DISAPPEARING BAG'' &QL; 
Rosemary Wells (Viking, $15.99) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Author of more than 60 children's books, Wells and her beloved
bunny Morris always are a hit. This tale begins on Christmas
morning. Morris' brother Victor gets a hockey outfit. His sister
Rose gets a beauty kit. His sister Betty gets a chemistry set.
Hands off, they say to Morris, who gets a teddy bear.
</P>
<P>
   Then Morris discovers one last gift left under the tree, which
leads to much merriment. The adorable pictures of the bunny family
are funny and captivating. For ages 3-7. &QL;

 &HT;    Airlines ready to launch improved service policies
 &HT;    By Gary Hendricks
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As the holiday season approaches, the nation's major
airlines are promising to treat you with a little more kindness.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from Congress, which had threatened legislative
action, the air carriers came up with their own customer service
policies and asked lawmakers to give them a chance to win back the
affection of the public. The new policies will begin Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines promise to:
</P>
<P>
   _ Inform passengers of the lowest fare available on every
flight.
</P>
<P>
   _ Give early notification of delays and cancellations.
</P>
<P>
   _ Respond to complaints within 60 days (Atlanta's dominant
carrier, Delta Air Lines, is promising action within 30 days).
</P>
<P>
   _ Increase the lost baggage liability limit from $1,250 to
$2,500.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines' version of the much-discussed airline passenger
``bill of rights'' will not abridge their freedom to put as many
people as they can onto the same airplane nor guarantee a traveler
the right to a speedy arrival time. In other words, don't expect
airliners to be any less crowded or timely.
</P>
<P>
   But, airline officials say, the policies will better inform
Hartsfield International Airport passengers about flight delays and
why they are happening.
</P>
<P>
   Delta will allow passengers to shop for better fares until
midnight the next day from the time they book their flights. That
exceeds the industry standard of 24 hours, said Vicki Escarra,
Delta executive vice president of customer service.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocate and Atlanta Journal-Constitution columnist
Clark Howard cited fare shopping and the increased lost baggage
limit to $2,500 as the true benefits of the customer initiatives.
``Most of (the rest of it) is corporate PR,'' Howard said.
</P>
<P>
   Experienced passengers are skeptical of the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they are going to act until they are forced to
act,'' said Mike Bilton of Smyrna, a frequent flier. Delays,
overbooking and lost baggage will continue to be the norm, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bunch of lip service,'' Bilton added.
</P>
<P>
   Horror stories _ passengers trapped for hours without food,
drink or restroom access on airplanes grounded by snowstorms _
recounted at congressional hearings early this year set off a
threat of a federally imposed passenger bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines, through the Air Trade Association, asked Congress
and Clinton administration regulators to not force-feed them a new
set of regulations. The airlines won a reprieve this summer on the
condition they regulate themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Customer service complaints are especially severe at major hub
airports like Hartsfield, which last year became the top passenger
airport with 73.5 million travelers. In a national poll this year,
54 percent of Americans said late flights were a big problem.
Fifty-one percent were irked by long lines at airports. The
Time/CNN poll of 1,021 adults was conducted Nov. 10-11, with a
sampling effort of 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Each airline has adopted specific guidelines on improved
customer service, and officials say travelers should contact their
airline or check out their Web sites for details. Delta, which
along with subsidiary Atlantic Southeast Airlines, accounts for
some 80 percent of passenger volume at Hartsfield, has published a
12-point initiative the airline says exceeds industry standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing you will see,'' said Delta's Escarra, ``is
that we will notify you as soon as we can'' at home or office when
flights are canceled.
</P>
<P>
   The airline also is promising to keep passengers at the gate or
on planes informed about the causes of delays and to update that
information every 15 minutes, Escarra said.
</P>
<P>
   Escarra said, however, the customer service initiatives are
``nothing sexy'' and won't be fully implemented without the
nation's air traffic control system cooperating by supplying the
airlines with the information required to keep passengers informed.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government now invests $2.2 billion annually in
technological upgrades for air traffic control, said Dennis
Koehler, FAA Southeastern regional division manager for air
traffic. The FAA is bringing new systems on line as quickly as
safety permits and will be able to meet the demands of the airlines
and the public, Koehler added.
</P>
<P>
   But ``it isn't a big bang,'' Koehler said. ``We will make
changes methodically and incrementally.''
</P>
<P>
   Improvements can't come fast enough for some, however. Late last
week, Betty Brown of Albemarle, N.C., on a shopping trip to New
York with her husband, were blindsided making connections in
Atlanta, although their reservations were made six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns' flight from Charlotte, N.C., was late, and stand-bys
were given their seats, she said looking at what was supposed to be
her plane as it backed from the gate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to get there,'' Brown said.

EUROPEAN UNION PLANNING TO HAVE MILITARY FORCE AVOID DUPLICATION
WITH NATO 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ By deciding to equip itself to send up to 60,000 troops
to a crisis zone like Bosnia or Kosovo, the European Union aims to
become a strategic player the United States and other countries
will have to reckon with.
</P>
<P>
   French officials, chafing under what some of them call American
``hyperpower,'' have long wanted to make Europe a political and
military power as well as an economic colossus.
</P>
<P>
   Now other European leaders have adopted the military goal,
agreeing at a meeting Friday in Helsinki to build the command and
planning staffs, intelligence bases, and the decision-making and
deployment apparatus needed to realize their new ambition by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The allies in the 15-member union, including France, pledged
that Europe's new military strength would not detract from, but
instead would contribute to, the cohesion and effectiveness of the
NATO alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Europe takes on more responsibility by building up its
military strength, that will contribute to the long-term
equilibrium of the alliance,'' said Defense Minister Alain Richard
of France in an interview. ``Now the European Union is stepping up
to its responsibilities and over the next few years will become a
genuine actor on the scene, one that didn't exist before.''
</P>
<P>
   The allied military structure is led and dominated by the United
States. During the recent NATO bombing campaign in Yugoslavia, it
became clear that Europe was lagging in ability to assemble or
transport sizable peacekeeping forces quickly, and was in danger of
falling far behind advanced American military technology, leading
to the push for European improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, recently explained his
thinking, saying, ``The Europe of the future must be able to defend
its interests and values effectively worldwide.'' As far as
Europe's military dimension is concerned, he said, ``close and
confidential cooperation between the European Union and NATO'' is
essential. ``There must and will be no thought of competition
here,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, without whose support the
plan would never have been conceived, has also made clear that the
NATO alliance would remain the bedrock of European security.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, American military and civilian officials are
taking such assurances at face value.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Wesley Clark, the American who is NATO's top military
commander, put it this way recently: ``I think anything that
increases the overall capabilities of the members of NATO in the
defense area is commendable and we should be pushing it. We've got
to make sure the institutions, as they emerge, and the linkages, as
they emerge, in fact do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The main American concern, as Clark put it, is ``decoupling or
duplication or discrimination against non-European Union, European
members of NATO,'' and here the new European plan has the seeds of
potential long-term irritation for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Richard, the French defense minister, concedes this. ``What fear
of duplication really conceals is worry about the appearance of a
new political partner, the European Union,'' he said. ``It's a new
situation that's a bit disturbing, that upsets old habits, because
at the moment, inside the Atlantic alliance, there are only
dispersed European states _ the only common, cohesive element is
NATO itself.''
</P>
<P>
   He and other French officials said that the military staff the
European Union would set up in Brussels would be nowhere near the
size of the NATO military staff, down the road at Clark's
headquarters in Mons. A European military secretariat reporting to
Javier Solana, former secretary-general of the alliance, will
decide how many military planners the European Union needs in a new
general staff, Richard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm persuaded that it should be basically rather modest,'' he
said. Other French officials said a European general staff would
probably number no more than a few hundred officers, who would draw
heavily on planning done by their counterparts in the member
states.
</P>
<P>
   The new European defense structure would also include a military
committee of chiefs of participating national defense staffs to
advise the European political leaders, who would decide when and
where to send forces. The 60,000 troops earmarked for European use
in a crisis would be the same ones NATO could use if it decided to
get involved, French officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard said the European plan is consistent with the alliance's
``defense capabilities initiative,'' a plan adopted at a NATO
summit meeting in Washington last April to improve the
effectiveness of future multinational military operations like the
bombing campaign in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The requirements, the performance levels, the expected
specifications are all the same,'' Richard said, and duplication
will be minimal, though American officials are not so sure.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Richard contends that the United States should help contribute
to a new strategic balance within the alliance by allowing the
American military to buy more arms from European defense
industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have told our American friends several times that in our
opinion _ and this isn't just a French view _ even if it's
unintended, security regulations and limits on access to the
American market are a real impediment to the existence of a
trans-Atlantic market,'' he said. ``It's a delicate subject,
because it has to do with national security concerns that are
legitimate and respectable, and it's not a subject that will be
solved with loud public discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials in Europe agree and are concerned that
resentment at American strategic, technological and economic
superiority could bring a resurgence of anti-Americanism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fiery rhetoric and anti-American tirades by some senior
leaders in Europe complicate this situation immensely, and are
difficult to ignore on our side of the Atlantic,'' Jacques Gansler,
a senior Pentagon official, warned a gathering of French defense
industrialists in Toulouse last week.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, France has not been seen as trustworthy in
handling American defense secrets as Britain is. Gansler said in
Toulouse that the United States wants more trans-Atlantic defense
industry cooperation but insisted that effective safeguards by the
allies for the American technology they wanted were ``an absolute
prerequisite.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard said, ``I think the United States side needs to think
about this to see if they aren't in danger of closing the American
market to European producers.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was Britain, which long refused to discuss with its
European partners any security arrangements outside of NATO, that
finally allowed France to achieve its longstanding ambition to lead
Europe to a modest autonomous defense capability of its own. Blair
agreed on that objective with President Jacques Chirac of France
more than a year ago, setting the stage for European leaders to
adopt the plan last June in Cologne and to spell it out over the
weekend in Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
   At the insistence of Britain and other allies, including Germany
and the Netherlands, the leaders agreed that Europe would deploy
forces on its own only in situations where the alliance _ meaning,
in effect, the United States _ had decided not to get involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the condition, that's the agreement,'' Richard said,
adding that he had told Secretary of Defense William Cohen in
Brussels early this month that France and the United States were
pulling on the same string by insisting that some of the allies
should increase defense spending, for NATO's sake as well as
Europe's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's not realistic for Europeans to say we are
spending enough and that all we need to do is create more synergy
and achieve more efficient cooperation,'' Richard said. He said he
thinks that the commitment made for spending on new equipment is
short of what it should be.
</P>
<P>
   According to alliance figures, the United States spends about
3.2 percent of its gross domestic product on defense, down from 6
percent during the Cold War, with France and Britain spending 2.8
and 2.6 percent respectively. But Germany spends only 1.5 percent
and Spain 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   France, another French defense official said, will press its
European partners to set spending targets for buying the new
satellite-based navigation and guidance systems, fighter planes,
and transport aircraft that will be needed to make a European
fighting force fully deployable within 60 days, the target set by
the Helsinki plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be easier, actually, for the Europeans to agree not to
fall below these spending targets than it would be for them to
agree to them as part of a NATO plan,'' the French official said.
``There they could always fall short and say the United States had
pressed them to accept unrealistic goals.''

DESPITE SETBACKS, NASA IS SEEN AS BEING ON COURSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., N.Y.)  (mk) 
 By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lean, mean and ready to do things differently, Daniel Goldin
came to the office of NASA administrator seven years ago as a
crusader eager to shake up an agency adrift in failure and
mediocrity. His mantra was ``faster, cheaper, better.''
</P>
<P>
   No more behemoths that cost many billions of dollars apiece
would be built to explore outer space. Instead, he vowed to tap
American ingenuity to build swarms of small but powerful spacecraft
that would probe the heavens, sending back a nearly constant stream
of new information. Today, about $100 billion later, the revolution
that Goldin engineered is in a crisis. It has suffered its worst
blows yet with the loss in recent months of a pair of Mars craft _
an orbiter and a lander with two innovative surface probes the size
of cantaloupes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is surprising agreement among NASA officials and
leaders in space exploration that despite its current troubles, the
agency is on course.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin, 59, the longest continuously serving head of NASA, is
zealous, even as he appoints blue-ribbon panels to investigate the
current problems. He says he is chastened by failure but unbowed in
his tenets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got set back,'' he said of the Mars failures in an
interview. ``But we'll pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and
we're going to rock this world. The revolution continues.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that his initiatives had not only produced dozens of
successes in space exploration _ discovering new worlds and probing
many others, from the moon to the galactic maternity wards where
stars are born _ but had also saved taxpayers at least $40 billion.
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen space leaders seemed to echo Goldin's judgment.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of interviews, they said his revolution is basically
sound, if shaken. Plans for the Mars program, shattered by
disaster, are in flux. But no expert foresaw big changes in the
principles of ``faster, cheaper, better,'' or a need for anything
more than relatively minor adjustments in what some call Capt.
Dan's star trek.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some analysts said that the voyage is just beginning to
pick up speed and that big advances lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fell into cutting too many corners,'' said John Beckman,
head of the systems division at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena, Calif., which designed the recently lost spacecraft.
``But the basic process is not broken. There's still a lot to be
gained from increasing our efficiency. I really do believe that
we've barely scratched the surface in terms of what's possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Claude Canizares, chairman of the space studies board at the
National Academy of Sciences and director of the Center for Space
Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, agreed,
saying that on balance the revolution's troubles were worth the
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible that the pendulum has swung too far,'' he said.
``But you can argue that, given the realities of human nature, this
was bound to happen and it's not wholly a bad thing. It helps you
define the limits. Hopefully we can learn from that in terms of
best practices, rather than learning as in a tribunal.''
</P>
<P>
   John Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at George
Washington University, was the most critical, saying that penny
pinching had pushed many teams to the breaking point.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a balance between science return, acceptance of risk
and cost reduction,'' he said. ``Those have gotten out of balance,
with too much emphasis on cost reduction. But the idea of doing
missions more rapidly and at lower cost certainly is still valid.
The issue is how rapidly and how much cost reduction.''
</P>
<P>
   The general upbeat appraisal for ``faster, cheaper, better'' is
all the more remarkable given a rash of failures that began in 1997
and reached a crescendo in past weeks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Two Earth-observing craft, Lewis and Clark, failed in orbit in
1997 and in production in 1998, victims of instrument problems,
testing delays, rising costs and control-system flaws.
</P>
<P>
   _ In December 1998, the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous
spacecraft missed its meeting with Eros, a potato-shaped rock 25
miles long. It is to try again next year.
</P>
<P>
   _ The telescope on the Wide-Field Infrared Explorer satellite
lost its protective cover shortly after launch last March, letting
coolant escape into space and ruining the astronomy mission.
</P>
<P>
   _ In September, a mix-up between English and metric units in
navigation data sent the Mars Climate Orbiter off course and
probably plummeting into the red planet in fiery death.
</P>
<P>
   _ This month, the Mars Polar Lander, consisting of a traditional
probe with retrorockets as well as two small hitchhikers meant to
smash into the planet at 400 mph and survive to send back data,
fell silent as it neared touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   After the latest failures, NASA promised a ``major rethinking''
of the strategy for the Mars program, which could include a
two-year delay in the next landing effort, planned for launching in
2001.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the ominous cast of recent events, more than one analyst
noted that there have been many more successes than failures.
Winners include spacecraft that have studied the moon, the sun, an
asteroid, the Earth's magnetosphere, interstellar clouds,
interplanetary dust and distant stars, and new kinds of engines for
advanced spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   The Mars Pathfinder mission in 1997 became a global sensation as
its plucky little robot, Sojourner, rolled across the Martian soil,
analyzing rocks and sending back stunning photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Howard McCurdy, a space historian at American University who is
working on a book about the Goldin revolution, noted that the total
cost of 16 small missions was about the same as the Cassini
spacecraft, a $3.3 billion colossus of the old school now on its
way to Saturn.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why it's so attractive,'' he said of the revolution.
``You can do 16 missions for price of one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' McCurdy added, ``you lose maybe 20 percent but you're
still ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   The NASA program that is hard to shrink dramatically for safety
reasons, he said, is that of human spaceflight, including the
nation's fleet of space shuttles and the international space
station taking shape in orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Their costs, McCurdy said, dwarf those of the satellites and
probes and account for roughly half the NASA budget, which this
year is $13.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Burns, a planetary scientist at Cornell University, said
the Goldin revolution had considerable merit but was failing to
come to grips with future big-ticket exploratory goals that were
inherently hard to do fast and cheap. Examples he cited were ``a
serious search'' for life on Mars and a major voyage to the outer
solar system, where icy planets and comets hold many clues of
creation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people would still like to do that,'' he said of a
trek to the dark fringes of the sun's realm.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin said his agenda was expanding, not contracting, and that
by design it could continue to embrace risk and failure.
</P>
<P>
   If NASA has 10 winners out of 10 tries, he said, ``we have
mediocre goals.'' Conversely, he added, if two or three ambitious
tries fail while seven or eight succeed, that ``would be
unbelievable success.''
</P>
<P>
   Revolution is difficult but rewarding, he said. Most important,
``it goes on.''

 &HT;    Bradley vows not to settle for status quo
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Vice President Al Gore is a candidate with small
ideas, lacking the vision that would ``move humanity a few feet
forward,'' Bill Bradley said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some people who say we cannot do big things anymore,
that we can tinker around the edges and do a few little things here
and there,'' Bradley told some 2,000 delegates at the Florida
Democratic Party State Convention. ``Democratic leaders do not
settle.''
</P>
<P>
   Using Social Security, Medicare and civil rights as examples,
Bradley said, ``We've been the party of big ideas and big
achievement.'' Then in an apparent reference to Gore, Bradley said,
``I find it so dismaying that one Democrat can attack another on
these issues that are an article of faith in our party. If we are
united in anything we have to be united on these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has begun to sharpen the contrast between him and Gore
as the presidential candidates enter the final six weeks of
campaigning before the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   In a 45-minute speech, the former New Jersey senator attempted
to portray himself as the candidate with the understanding,
compassion and vision who would use the presidency to reach ``the
untapped potential'' in neighborhoods to bring about change in
society.
</P>
<P>
   It was his first campaign appearance since checking himself into
a California hospital Friday because of an irregular heartbeat.
Bradley made no mention of his health.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley sought to make an impression after President Clinton
wowed the delegates and gave a ringing endorsement to Gore on
Saturday just hours before the vice president himself appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley and Gore are in a tight race in Iowa and New Hampshire
and several other early primary states. Bradley, who noted that he
started his campaign a year ago Saturday, has gone from long shot
to surprise contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is just an incredible guy,'' said Mike Abrams, a Miami
attorney and former state legislator who worked for Sen. Ted
Kennedy's 1980 presidential campaign. ``He is intelligent and
thoughtful and really cares about people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's star quality was evident at the convention. The former
New York Knicks basketball forward drew enthusiastic crowds
wherever he went, posing for pictures and signing autographs on
basketballs.
</P>
<P>
   Before his speech, the campaign showed a 12-minute biographical
video. Bradley was introduced by Duval County Sheriff Nat Glover,
the state's first black sheriff, who accused Republicans of trying
to use the strong economy to ``spiff up the first class
accommodations on the prosperity train instead of adding more
passengers.''
</P>
<P>
   With his reading glasses perched on his nose, Bradley continued
that theme saying, ``We cannot rest in this country and say we have
a good economy unless more and more people are reaching higher
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying he wants to ``be the protector of the natural
environment,'' Bradley said he frequently visits Florida and, ``the
Florida that I know is a Florida of beautiful Everglades, a
coastline that is incredible'' and a place that must be preserved.
</P>
<P>
   Attempting to sell himself as a candidate of high ideals,
Bradley said, ``if neither morality nor world leadership convince
you of my ideas, then try self-interest.'' He then explained that
with expected population trends in the next decade, ``the economic
future of children of white Americans will depend more on the
economic future of nonwhite Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming back to what has become a new theme for the campaign,
Bradley did a medley of ``I'm not prepared to settle,'' statements:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not prepared to settle for anything less than making
access to health care available to all Americans. I'm not prepared
to settle for anything short of registering and licensing all
handguns in this country.'' he said. ``I'm not prepared to settle
for anything less than bringing all children out of poverty. I'm
not prepared to settle for anything less than getting money out of
politics with public financing of campaigns. I'm not prepared for a
retreat on affirmative action. I'm not prepared to settle for
anything less than the best public schools in the world with public
money for public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore supporter Janet Stroth said she was impressed by Bradley's
performance but doubted if he could win the presidential
nomination. ``I think he has some good ideas but I don't think he's
really saying anything that different from Al Gore. I think Gore is
a better candidate and will have a better chance of defeating the
Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   After his speech, Bradley attended a luncheon where he expected
to raise about $100,000. The campaign also plans to have a
fund-raising event in West Palm Beach later this month.

CONCERN OVER YEAR 2000 REMAINS LOW IN SURVEYS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the days winding down until the year 2000, each new survey
or poll seems to add to the evidence that Americans are confident
computer glitches will not have much impact on their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The National Federation of Independent Businesses, the leading
trade association for small companies, reported recently that many
members who had said last spring that they would take steps to
prepare for computer problems this fall had now decided not to
bother.
</P>
<P>
   And a survey for the National Association of Manufacturers found
that 93 percent of members expected the year 2000 to have almost no
impact on their companies and only 4 percent foresaw significant
disruptions of any part of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's news in this survey is what we're not seeing,'' said
Jerry Jasinowski, the manufacturing group's president, in
announcing the results last Friday. ``There's no last-minute panic
and little stockpiling of inventory.''
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturers' sample was small _ just 100 of its 14,000
members _ but the economist who did the survey, Edward Yardeni of
Deutsche Bank, said the results were in line with answers to the
same questions by a much larger group of similar companies just two
weeks earlier. (The data from these surveys, and prior samplings,
is at www.peoplepolls.com). The levels of concern rise only when
certain sectors, like health care, are isolated, Yardeni said.
</P>
<P>
   The air of normalcy is being reinforced by surveys that are
actually thinly disguised advertising. Blockbuster Video recently
reported that more than 22 percent of those it polled planned to
celebrate the arrival of Year 2000 by renting a movie and staying
home. London International Group, maker of Durex condoms, reported
that among 16- to 21-year-olds around the world nearly half intend
_ or at least hope _ that the big night include activities
requiring its products.
</P>
<P>
   It all adds up to a challenging climate for many Year 2000
entrepreneurs, particularly those who anticipated that disruptions
and public concern would be in full swing by now.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the book world. ``The Millennium Bug'' by Michael
Hyatt, probably the best seller so far among Year 2000 books, is
hanging strong, relatively speaking, in the 820 spot on Amazon's
hardcover sales list. But ``Time Bomb 2000'' the one-time
hot-seller by Edward Yourdon, a well-known software expert, and his
daughter, Jennifer, was down to 12,322 overall in the rankings. And
``Crisis Investing for the Year 2000'' by L. Jay Kuo and Edward M.
Dua, was languishing at 86,808.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jan Nickerson, who claims to have created the only
Year 2000 board game, has just started a two-for-one sale ($34
including shipping at www.Y2KConnections.com).
</P>
<P>
   Those trying to sell their wares are increasingly competing with
others who make many of the same points more succinctly for free.
The Utne Reader recently began offering free copies of its Y2K
Citizen's Action Guide to any group that wants at least 50 (contact
mitra(AT)utne.com). ``Awakening: the Upside of Y2K,'' a collection
of essays on community and personal preparedness edited by Judy
Laddon, Larry Shook and Tom Atlee, costs $7 at Amazon.com; but Ms.
Laddon will give 50 or more copies free to anyone who pays shipping
costs (JGLaddon(AT)aol.com).
</P>
<P>
   And last week, Global Action Plan, a nonprofit environmental
group in Woodstock, N.Y., announced plans to distribute 125,000
preparedness brochures to community groups in 16 states, all
financed by the Nathan Cummings Foundation. (The brochure can be
downloaded free at www.GlobalActionPlan.org).

PANAMANIANS HAVE MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT CANAL TRANSFER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANAMA CITY, Panama _ With the zest of salesmen and the zeal of
patriots, Panamanian officials tout ambitious plans to convert
sprawling acres of formerly off-limits properties along their
famous canal into bustling commercial hubs and tropical tourist
oases.
</P>
<P>
   Smooth and practiced, they vow to create more jobs than the U.S.
military presence here ever did, eagerly projecting millions of
dollars in revenue to benefit social programs in health, education
and housing.
</P>
<P>
   But for a nation about to receive what amounts to a $5 billion
bonanza, there have been few outward signs of celebration leading
up to what on Tuesday will be the symbolic transfer of the canal
and the thousands of buildings, airstrips and military
installations along the waterway's 50-mile route from U.S. to
Panamanian hands.
</P>
<P>
   Banners and billboards proclaiming the fulfillment of the 1977
treaty signed between President Jimmy Carter and Gen. Omar Torrijos
to hand over the canal are noticeably lonely sights, reflecting
Panamanian ambivalence and skittishness over the loss of U.S. jobs
and money, and skepticism about their own government's ability. It
is Panama's singular version of the Y2K glitch: how to deal with a
day that people once thought would never come.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's `Gringo, stay home,''' said Guillermo Sanchez Borbon, a
Panamanian writer who was exiled under the regime of Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega. ``The Panamanians don't trust the politicians to
keep this thing going. Now the gringos are going, and if anything
goes wrong, we have to fix it. And people are terrified. They don't
trust the Panamanian government. They don't trust themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The occasion is without question a landmark in Panama's path
toward transforming itself from a nation both nurtured and
overshadowed by the United States into a fully sovereign state
intent on proving to both its people and the world that it can
succeed on its own.
</P>
<P>
   And government officials here speak with confidence and the
coming-of-age emotion of a son leaving his father's house _ an
image that incidentally was also used when Panama declared its
independence from Colombia in 1903.
</P>
<P>
   But they know that full control of the canal and its properties
brings with it enormous challenges and responsibilities for a
country where corruption and partisan feuds have marked much of its
political history.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the properties, except for the canal itself, have
already been handed over and real control over the canal will not
come until noon on Dec. 31, Panama will soon have to develop its
own national security plans and foreign policy to protect its
borders and the canal.
</P>
<P>
   And although the canal is already operated by an almost entirely
Panamanian staff and will be overseen by an agency insulated from
government meddling, officials must still seek to reassure the
canal's users from all over the world that the operations of one of
the world's most crucial passageways will remain safe and above
board.
</P>
<P>
   More mundane, but equally important, they will also have to
start attracting tourists to a place that most travelers had merely
passed through, and where those who stopped did so mainly for
business or banking.
</P>
<P>
   Ambivalence over the hand-over has also been reflected in the
United States, where conservatives have lambasted the ``loss'' of
the canal and raised alarms about Panamanian ventures with Chinese
firms. Fears of a backlash may have prevented President Clinton and
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright from attending Tuesday's
events, but they have still expressed confidence in Panama's
ability to manage the enormous trust it is inheriting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Panama truly steps into a class of countries that have
international responsibilities, because the canal is an
international asset,'' said U.S. Ambassador Simon Ferro. ``How they
manage the canal will in large measure dictate how they are viewed
by the rest of the world. It is going to be a very interesting
future for Panama and the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Canal administrators said they had been preparing for years to
make the transition as seamless as possible for the 14,000 ships
that pass through the canal's locks on their route over the
continental divide.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the employees who run the canal have been retained. They
have begun to modernize the fleet of locomotives and tugboats that
guide ships through the passage, and to replace ancient electric
motors with hydraulic systems to open the gates. They are also
completing a widening project that will allow bigger vessels to
pass and will lead to a 20 percent increase in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Sensitive to fears of corruption, patronage or reliance on the
canal to cover government spending, the agency will have its own
labor laws, procurement procedures and fiscal controls to safeguard
its financial independence. Annual payments to the Panamanian
government will be held for a year, to ensure that enough resources
are available to maintain and operate the canal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pinata attitude is not there,'' said Roberto Eisenmann, an
adviser to President Mireya Moscoso. ``This is not just a
government entity that politicians can fight over to see who can
get the spoils. It is a business. It depends on the confidence of
its customers. A lot of other countries have a stake in what
happens here.''
</P>
<P>
   Alberto Aleman Zubieta, the deputy administrator of the Panama
Canal Commission, said the measures were also vital if Panama was
going to make the best use of the canal and its properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, our society has to understand as we do the
tremendous importance of what we are doing here and use this route
to make Panama what I think it will be,'' said Aleman Zubieta, who
will head the Panama Canal Authority. ``It is our destiny to become
the major and most important hub for transshipment of containerized
cargo in all of Latin America.''
</P>
<P>
   If it is to achieve that goal, however, Panama must first deal
with its recent past. Colombian guerrillas have made repeated
incursions into the dense jungle to the south and drug lords have
settled into comfortable surroundings in the capital, where
gleaming towers are home to condominiums and banks.
</P>
<P>
   There are also worries about the canal being unprotected by U.S.
troops, admittedly more of a psychological deterrent in recent
years because of their decreasing numbers as bases closed.
</P>
<P>
   Panamanian officials said they had adopted U.S.-style security
plans for the canal, although they had yet to reach an agreement
with the United States on sharing information about ship traffic.
They have also drawn up a national security plan that is aimed at
balancing all their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have lived 20 years with border problems,'' said Winston
Spadafora, the minister of government and justice. ``But how long
could Panama live without the canal? So we have prioritized the
security of the canal and will then gradually develop the other
areas of security.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Questions about security have been raised by critics of Panama's
decision to award two port concessions to Hutchison Whampoa, a Hong
Kong company that also runs the largest container port in England.
The move was met with alarm by conservatives who claim the company
will be a puppet of the Chinese army and could block U.S. ships
from entering the canal.
</P>
<P>
   But Panamanian officials and their U.S. supporters dismiss the
claims, noting that the ports have no control over entry into the
canal and that the transfer treaty allows for U.S. intervention if
the canal's neutrality is threatened.
</P>
<P>
   ``The anti-Chinese sentiment is based on a simple and profound
motive,'' said Robert Pastor, a political scientist at Emory
University. ``At the simplest level, there are people who have not
been informed that the Cold War is over and we won it. China is a
very large country and extraordinarily poor. It is simply not in
our league.''
</P>
<P>
   Running the canal may prove easier than the gargantuan task of
converting drab and utilitarian military bases into attractive
money-making ventures. Already hundreds of homes have been sold at
prices that are often lower than residences elsewhere in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the transformation is evident, and sometimes jarring, in
an area that for several generations was the exclusive domain of
the Americans who ran the canal and the bases. Construction crews
are busy adding new windows, doors and rooms in what used to be the
homes of high-ranking officers, while couples are moving into
low-slung cinder-block duplexes, and Panamanian flags flutter on
lawns.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was our land but it was used by other people,'' said
Francisco de Leon, a physician who moved his family into a
three-bedroom house in Curundu. ``All the history of Panama with
the United States is here. Now we have a piece of that history,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   The real money and challenge, however, lies in the development
of the largest facilities, especially the former Howard Air Force
base, where several companies have already expressed interest in
converting the base into a regional transportation hub or aircraft
maintenance facility.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the government has been soliciting proposals and bids
for projects like manufacturing sites, ports and eco-lodges, some
of which have already been built.
</P>
<P>
   The former airstrip at Albrook Field, for instance, has been
turned into a civil aviation facility, and a cavernous shopping
center is rising next to it. Officials also talk of using the land
around the canal to stimulate the creation of maritime and
environmental businesses and institutes like the City of Knowledge,
a research park planned for Fort Clayton.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where we hope to bring the Intels of the world,'' said
Nicolas Ardito Barletta, who was president of Panama in the
mid-1980s and is currently the regional authority's general
administrator. ``We know it is an ambitious project. It will take
20 years to develop, but it has begun.''
</P>
<P>
   But ambition may also be a handicap. Ricardo Arias Calderon, who
was vice president of Panama in the early 1990s, said the nation
had been given too much to soon, making it difficult to hold on to
the properties until a potential investor could afford to buy into
the grandest and most expensive projects. He thinks the regional
authority has pinned its hopes onto too many big and uncertain
projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like you are being sent a Chinese banquet with all the
plates at once,'' he said. ``There is pressure to carry things out
rapidly. To do that, we have to be less sanguine about what we can
get in money for what is developed.''
</P>
<P>
   Big plans were far from Orlando Cordoba's mind a few days ago,
as he took a break from his bus-driving job and sat under a tree
near Balboa High School. A few feet away, dozens of tiny Panamanian
flags had been planted on the grass, in memory of protests for the
right to fly the national colors along with the Stars and Stripes
in the areas ringing the canal.
</P>
<P>
   The protests climaxed in January 1964, when several Panamanian
students were killed during a confrontation with police protecting
the Americans at the high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a long time ago,'' said Cordoba, who was born that
same year. On the verge of seeing his country attain the goal that
cost the lives of those students, he was left wondering about the
price of nationalism. Christmas was not looking good. The
millennium remained uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not understand,'' he said. ``Panama will be cleaned out,
without money or anything. That was all the gringos produced. You
know how many people worked in there? When they go, what's left?''

 &HT;    Americans lacking in knowledge about Asia, poll says
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ How many Americans do you think would know which
body of water separates the United States from Asia?
</P>
<P>
   In a survey released Sunday by the Asia Society, 810 adults and
1,012 college-bound high school students were offered four answers:
Atlantic Ocean, China Sea, Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that 68 percent of the adults and 74 percent of
the students correctly named the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   But 32 percent of adults and 26 percent of the students got it
wrong
</P>
<P>
   On the other 15 questions on a quiz to test their knowledge of
Asia both adults and students fared even worse. Most of the adults
missed half of the questions and most of the students were wrong on
nearly two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public lacks in-depth knowledge about Asia,'' concluded
the Asia Society, a nonprofit American organization based in New
York. It had hired Penn, Schoen &AMP; Berland Associates, which polls
for the White House, to administer the multiple-choice exams over
the phone in August and September. The poll's sampling margin of
error was 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A dinner Sunday was the first gathering of members of a new
commission formed by the society to design and supervise a $5
million campaign to increase Americans' knowledge of Asia through
``improvements in standards, lessons, teacher knowledge and
textbooks.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission of more than 30 educational, philanthropic,
corporate and state leaders is led by three co-chairs: Gov. Jim
Hunt of North Carolina, high school teacher Charlotte Mason of
Newton, Mass., and former Berkeley chancellor Chang-Lin Tien.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our kids know more than enough about Nintendo, the world's
largest selling video game, and far too little about India, the
world's largest democracy,'' said Hunt in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the test-takers thought the United States was the
largest democracy, although India has more than twice times as many
people.
</P>
<P>
   Those taking the multiple-choice phone test scored highest when
they were asked which of four countries _ India, Great Britain,
Philippines, United States _ ``has never elected a woman as head of
the government.'' But 79 percent of adults and 77 percent of
students who correctly chose the United States simply may have been
showing knowledge about their own country's presidents, rather than
Asian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Six out of every 10 in both groups knew that the yin-yang symbol
(that circle with an S-shaped curve separating the black and white
halves) symbolizes ``harmony of opposites.''
</P>
<P>
   The same number knew that it was was Gandhi, rather than Nehru,
Confucius or Pol Pot, who had strongly influenced civil rights
leader Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The Asia Society said the test groups did worst when asked which
of four countries _ China, United States, India, France _ ``has the
largest film industry in the world.'' Perhaps reflecting a U.S.
cultural emphasis upon exports and box-office grosses, only 8
percent of adults and 4 percent of students chose India, which in
most years produces more feature-length movies in more languages
than any other country.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows)
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the pollsters didn't even expect their own
phone-callers to know much about Asia. The script for the
questioners included this question: ``What is the capital of
Indonesia? Oo-lan bah-tore, Bang-cock, Ja-carta, Ma-nill-a?'' Sure
enough, even with those helpful pronunciations of Ulan Bator,
Bangkok, Jakarta and Manila, only 33 percent of adults and 22
percent of students picked Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   Just before taking the test, the respondents showed that
mediocre scores wouldn't surprise them: 45 percent of the adults
and 32 percent of the students admitted to being ``not very'' or
``not at all'' knowledgeable about Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Nor would the mediocre scores surprise the respondents, who
consisted of a sample that is probably within five percentage
points of correctly reflecting all adults and college-bound
students in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Would Asians do better than Americans on a test about Asia?
Probably. Yet three years ago, the newspaper Asahi Shimbun asked
2,307 Japanese what they mean by ``Asia.'' It turned out that 56
percent felt that India, Pakistan, Iran, Turkey and Saudi Arabia
are outside Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, computers wouldn't have aced the test either.
</P>
<P>
   An Internet site which offers to answer factual questions
(www.askjeeves.com) was asked the toughest of the 16 questions:
``Which of the following best characterized the Tokugawa period of
Japanese history? Fortified castle towns, many wars with China,
large navy, extensive network of foreign relations.''
</P>
<P>
   The first answer from AskJeeves was: ``I'm not sure I understood
your question correctly. Would you like me to check your
spelling?''
</P>
<P>
   The second answer provided a link to a site about Central Asia,
which is on the other side of China from Japan.

WORLD TRADE GROUP PICKING UP THE PIECES FROM SEATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Struggling to recover from the trade conference in
Seattle that collapsed in failure earlier this month, the World
Trade Organization plans a special meeting Friday to decide how to
proceed.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the 135-nation group that makes the rules for
international commerce said that the main purpose of the meeting of
its general council would be to regain momentum for resolving some
disputes that had foiled the ministerial conference in Seattle,
leaving delegates dispirited and angry.
</P>
<P>
   The conference had been intended as a forum for delegates to
agree on an agenda for lowering some of the remaining barriers to
freer world trade, through negotiations to take place during the
next few years.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of protesters disrupted the conference in scenes
reminiscent of the late 1960s mass action against American
involvement in the Vietnam War. They denounced the WTO as a
secretive, probusiness group that ignores environmental protection
and labor rights in the name of corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters blocked access to the conference sites on the first
day and some rampaged through downtown Seattle; more than 500 were
arrested by riot police officers, who have been accused of
responding with violent tactics of their own.
</P>
<P>
   The conference ended after delegates could not even agree on
whether to discuss issues that have divided them, most notably
agricultural subsidies and labor rights in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   In the week since WTO delegates returned to their Geneva
headquarters, many remain shocked by the events in Seattle. Some
staff members at the ordinarily quiet building that houses the
organization say they have been barraged by hate mail and
virus-laced e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is certainly a feeling of disappointment,'' said
Tunisia's envoy, Kamel Morjane, in a comment typical of the
negotiators who have returned.
</P>
<P>
   While most envoys refrained from finger-pointing in public,
there was no hesitance to do so in Brussels, where the European
Union trade commissioner, Pascal Lamy, attributed the breakdown in
Seattle to American presidential-campaign politics, and said he
doubted that a new round of negotiations could get under way until
after the election next November.
</P>
<P>
   The WTO's director general, Mike Moore, sounding a rare hopeful
note, said he wanted to get going with efforts to open a new round
of trade talks. ``The longer we delay launching the negotiations,''
he said, ``the more the poorest among us lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Others have expressed pessimism whether the organization can
even decide what should happen next.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a confusion here,'' said Mexico's envoy, Alejandro de
la Pena. ``It is not at all clear how we are going to follow up.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we all know this is not the end. It's not like this is the
first time we have found ourselves in a situation like this,'' he
said, alluding to the suspension of negotiations during the
previous Uruguay trade round in 1988 and 1990.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   FAVORING FOOTBALL
</P>
<P>
   The GHSA has established many rules and regulations that appear
to favor football over other sports. Some examples:
</P>
<P>
   _ Football officials are paid $63 per game, more than all other
sports. The rates in some other sports are $45-$55 for soccer, $42
for baseball, $40 for basketball.
</P>
<P>
   _ All GHSA activities must be completed by 11:30 p.m., except
varsity football games between schools in the same classification.
</P>
<P>
   _ Only football coaches are allowed input into the assignment of
game officials during the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Only football is allowed out-of-season practice.
</P>
<P>
   The association also places limitations on other sports. For
example:
</P>
<P>
   _ Volleyball coaches are forbidden to have spring skill-building
clinics in their feeder middle schools.
</P>
<P>
   _ Players on basketball teams that lose in the state semifinals
may not attend the championship game for free. Retired athletic
administrators receive lifetime passes entitling them entry.
</P>
<P>
   _ Basketball teams are forbidden to have a two-team scrimmage
the weekend before the season starts.
</P>
<P>
   TROPHY TROUBLE
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Track Club executive director Julia Emmons was stunned
upon learning that all six individual awards given at the girls
state track meet are named for men. ``Oh, you're kidding,'' Emmons
said. ``Nobody brought that to our attention.''
</P>
<P>
   It's true. Not a Gwen Torrence or a Wyomia Tyus in the bunch.
</P>
<P>
   The boys state meet in Jefferson has 20 individual trophies, all
named after former male athletes or coaches pre-dating school
integration, such as the Spec Towns Trophy in the 110 hurdles. They
are profiled in a 60-page glossy program sold at the boys meet,
while the only print materials available at the girls meet in
Albany are daily heat sheets.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Track Club pays for medals to the third- through
eighth-place finishers in both state meets. The GHSA provides
medals to the winners and runners-up.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT MUST BE EQUAL?
</P>
<P>
   Title IX requires that male and female athletes receive the same
benefits of athletic participation, including:
</P>
<P>
   _ Equipment, uniforms, supplies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Access to weight room and training room.
</P>
<P>
   _ Practice facilities.
</P>
<P>
   _ Size and quality locker rooms and competition facilities.
</P>
<P>
   _ Access to practice and games during prime time.
</P>
<P>
   _ Quality coaches.
</P>
<P>
   _ Opportunity to play quality opponents.
</P>
<P>
   _ Awards and banquets.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cheerleaders and band performances.
</P>
<P>
   For more information about Title IX and how you can make sure
your school is following federal law, call the Women's Sports
Foundation (800-227-3988) and ask about the publication, Playing
Fair.

<P>
   YOU MAKE THE CALL
</P>
<P>
   Two rival schools are playing a big Friday night football game.
Can the host school sell standing room-only admission?
</P>
<P>
   No. The GHSA requires schools to provide a seat for every ticket
sold _ and an available seat is defined as 18 inches in width.

   KAVKAZ CHECKPOINT, Russia _ The refugees were nowhere to be
found. But that did not fluster Sergei Shoigu, Russia's minister
for emergency situations and the leader of a Kremlin-backed party
in next weekend's parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   Zipped up in a natty red jacket, Shoigu led a caravan of
journalists from this checkpoint on the Chechnya-Ingushetia border
to a small town near the outskirts of Grozny, the Chechen capital.
</P>
<P>
   The ostensible purpose was to inaugurate a new humanitarian
corridor for the thousands of civilians trapped in the city, which
Russian forces have pounded for weeks. But after an unsuccessful
search for fleeing refugees, Shoigu indulged in a news conference
in which he pledged his undying efforts to help save civilian
lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are ready for contact with anyone who can help,'' he said.
That part of the trip was a success: The visit was prominently
featured in the evening news.
</P>
<P>
   With public support for the war running high, Russian
politicians have been making pilgrimages to the war zone to
demonstrate their concern for the Russian troops and bask in the
Russian television coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Chernomyrdin, the leader of the party called Our Home Is
Russia, and a former prime minister, swung through Chechnya on
Friday on a fact-finding mission.
</P>
<P>
   And Anatoly Chubais appeared in Gudermes, Chechnya's
second-largest city, three weeks ago, swathed in a full-length
black leather coat, to announce that the electricity would soon be
turned back on for the long-suffering population.
</P>
<P>
   Chubais, a former Kremlin aide who runs the nation's electrical
monopoly, is backing Right Cause, the pro-free-market party, which
is struggling to secure a toehold in the parliament. He is still
unpopular with many Russians because of his role in ushering in the
nation's untamed version of capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   The electricity was restored, but has since been plagued by
regular outages, Gudermes residents say. Still, the trip may have
helped rehabilitate Chubais' image at home. ``Russians hate Chubais
slightly less thanks to Chechnya,'' the newspaper Izvestia
observed.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Vladimir Putin, the intelligence officer turned prime
minister, who has reaped the greatest political advantage from the
war in Chechnya. His poll ratings have soared not only because he
has ordered a military campaign against the Islamic militants, but
also because he has stood up to the Western governments that have
criticized it.
</P>
<P>
   Putin visited the Russian-controlled areas of Chechnya in
October and also donned a flight suit at a nearby Russian military
base for a ride in an Su-25 plane, one of the principal aircraft
used by the Russian air force to blast targets in the breakaway
republic.
</P>
<P>
   It is not easy for Shoigu to match that military bravado. But he
is no slouch when it comes to generating publicity.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The new spokesman for his party is Mikhail Margelov, a former
advertising executive and the director of the Russian government
center set up to organize news coverage of the war. With
parliamentary elections scheduled for Dec.19, Margelov took a brief
leave of absence from his government post to work full time for
Shoigu.
</P>
<P>
   Shoigu's party, Unity, was set up with Kremlin support just a
few months ago to siphon away support from Yevgeni Primakov, the
former prime minister, and Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov. The other
leading figures on the Unity ticket are Alexander Karelin, an
immensely popular former wrestler, and Alexander Gurov, a
mafia-fighting former Interior Ministry official.
</P>
<P>
   Their television campaign ad shows news clips of each in action
and with no commentary. The political message seems to be that they
are men of action who can save Russia. And here at Kavkaz
Checkpoint life imitated art, or at least advertising.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Shoigu's mission was to open a new humanitarian corridor leading
from the embattled city of Grozny to Alkhan-Yurt, southwest of the
capital. The desperate refugees who made it through the escape
route would be placed on trucks and buses and taken away to safety.
</P>
<P>
   The operation began at this checkpoint, one of the main routes
to Ingushetia for Chechens who have fled the fighting in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling in a four-wheel drive vehicle and wearing a bright
blue cap emblazoned in English with the appellation ``Emercom,''
for emergency committee, Shoigu led a procession of seven gleaming
white trucks, five buses, an armored personnel carrier and
associated cars and vans.
</P>
<P>
   Not everything, however, went according to the script. As the
caravan raced along the main Caucasian highway toward Grozny, it
passed a small town that had been flattened by Russian firepower.
The photographers who had been brought along to document Shoigu's
intrepid journey into Chechnya snapped photos of the destruction.
Russian military spokesmen later sought to persuade the press that
the village had been occupied by rebels and devoid of civilians
when it was clobbered.
</P>
<P>
   The Shoigu procession throttled along the highway until it
reached a tree that lay across the road, the apparent dividing line
between Russian- controlled and rebel-controlled territory and the
site of a new checkpoint that the minister was commissioning.
</P>
<P>
   But there were no refugees. Apparently, the people in Grozny had
not been informed of Shoigu's press event.
</P>
<P>
   So Shoigu took out a satellite telephone and tried to call the
Chechen rebels in Grozny to hammer out an agreement that would
facilitate the evacuation of the civilian population. He never
reached the rebels there, so he tried to call Aslan Maskhadov, the
president of the breakaway Chechen republic, who apparently is not
residing in the capital; again he had no success.
</P>
<P>
   Grozny's mayor later denounced Shoigu's trip as an election-year
publicity stunt. But Shoigu insists that his concern for Grozny's
civilians transcends politics.
</P>
<P>
   After failing to find the refugees, he gave a news conference in
which he affirmed that he was ready to negotiate with the devil
himself if it would help the civilians get out of Grozny. He gave
out two telephone numbers that the rebels could call.
</P>
<P>
   Then he headed back to Ingushetia. The seven trucks that were to
haul away the refugees also returned _ empty.

IN LAGOS, THE MURKY LAGOON IS THE LIFE FOR MANY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria _ ``If I lived over there,'' said Jeremiah Faton,
gesturing vaguely toward the skyscrapers across the lagoon here in
West Africa's largest city, ``where would I put my boat?''
</P>
<P>
   Faton, 65, is a fisherman in Lagos. He lives on one of the
countless islands in Lagos lagoon, trolling its murky waters with
his dugout canoe during the fishing season, ferrying passengers to
the mainland during the low season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where would I fish?'' he continued cheerfully to a visitor who
had sought shelter from a cloudburst inside his shack, and had
asked him whether he had ever considered moving to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   The rain rattled the zinc roof over Faton's two rooms erected on
stilts, held together with clapboard and driftwood. Three small
girls giggled in the darkness of the main room, one of them
carrying on her back a boy with glassy eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Cracks on the floor showed goats snuffling below the shack,
lured by the refuse the low tide had left behind. A big pig stood
on a mound of garbage just outside the door, triumphantly somehow,
as it scratched its belly with a hind leg.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of people like Faton live in the shadows of
Lagos, squatting on bridgeless islands or, sometimes, on the lagoon
itself inside huts built on stilts. If the ever widening ripples
from Lagos and other cities are changing the rhythm of traditional
rural life in Africa, Faton and the other inhabitants of the lagoon
must surely rank among the most singular of urban migrants.
</P>
<P>
   Nomadic fishermen, they have replicated their traditional way of
life in the unlikeliest of places, Lagos, the megalopolis whose
official population of 8 million is considered a gross
underestimate _ Lagos, the loud, harried, urban giant who heaves to
life every morning, always with the risk of collapsing under its
own weight by noon.
</P>
<P>
   Like many African cities, Lagos often seems less like a city
than a collection of villages inhabited by different ethnic groups,
each clinging to its particular way of life amid the most
inhospitable of conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In one corner of the lagoon, three fishing shantytowns rise
above the stinking black water. A maze of raised flimsy planks,
linking hundreds of shacks perched on stilts, rests on a cesspool.
Children swim, bathe and play in the stagnant water. In the huts,
women smoke fish inside large clay pots, as the burning smell wafts
through one town called Makoko.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our custom,'' said one man, Abraham Messou. ``We build on
water since we are fishermen.''
</P>
<P>
   At dusk, as the sun set on the lagoon and cast an eerie orange
glow on Makoko, the town sank under the thickening haze from the
smoked fish. Canoes returning for the day passed under the Third
Mainland bridge, past a tiny island where the locals dig up clay
for their pots and bury their dead infants. The boats entered the
labyrinth, gliding on waters putrid from the day's wastes,
continuing their Stygian descent into Makoko.
</P>
<P>
   People were more prosperous in the next town, Sogunro Iwaya,
where sections have been filled with land. Kids played at a pool
table; others at Super Mario Brothers on a Nintendo running on the
lone generator.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can say that Nigeria is like the France of Africa,'' said
Pierre Kodja, 49, explaining that most of the townspeople were from
the neighboring country of Benin. Kodja, a fisherman, tailor and
traditional healer who had left Benin in 1977, was sitting in the
courtyard of a two-story house belonging to the chief, Moise
Messou, and his brother, Abraham Messou.
</P>
<P>
   As far back as the 1950s, poor fishermen from Benin began
gravitating to Lagos lagoon, where they found more customers able
to pay more money for their catch, they said. Over the years, more
and more Beninese immigrants settled in the lagoon and had children
here. And yet their lives here has changed little from their
village in Benin, so little that few today speak English, Nigeria's
official language, and many more understand French, the language of
Benin's former rulers.
</P>
<P>
   The town's one practitioner of Western medicine, Dr. Pierre
Denakpo, walked up to the chief's house. The doctor had also come
from Benin, 15 years ago, to treat his own people here. The
illnesses here never changed: diarrhea, malaria, cholera. Faton,
the fisherman, said five of his 11 children had died over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am returning to Benin next year,'' the doctor said, adding
that he had a clinic in another town in the lagoon, where many more
of his people had settled. One had to take a boat there, he said,
but go by way of Lagos first. Life on the ground in Lagos, so
chaotic, frenetic and seemingly lawless, was even beyond the
control of the generals who ruled Nigeria until half a year ago.
That may be one reason why they moved the capital to Abuja, in the
sparsely populated center of the country, a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patience is bitter, but its fruit is sweet,'' read a window
sticker on an orange public bus as it hurtled down the highway to
the city port, its tires bald, its rear lights a distant memory,
its inside so crammed with passengers that half the body of a young
man dangled out of an open side door. On a footbridge alongside the
highway, a man hung laundry on the guardrail.
</P>
<P>
   Bridges have turned into places of fear in Lagos, especially
since the police caught a deranged man living under Toyota Bridge,
so named after the nearby car dealership, several months ago. The
madman had lured his victims under the bridge and eaten them,
according to the police who found human remains there.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   With man-eaters stalking the streets at night and lurking under
bridges during the day, who wouldn't choose to live on an island
without bridges?
</P>
<P>
   At the port, hidden from the main road, a narrow entrance
between two buildings opened on a gutter, where three women were
washing clothes, and on a foot-wide edge running alongside one of
the buildings. The edge led to the lagoon, where fishermen paddled
their pirogues for a fee to Sogbokoji, the village where Denakpo
ran his clinic.
</P>
<P>
   But the doctor was away.
</P>
<P>
   The village children pointed to another clinic nearby, where an
excitable and cheerful man answered the door. He showed a visitor a
crumpled business card, but held on to it:
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. A.S. Theophilus, M.D. Christ Clinic.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside a small room with no electricity, Theophilus
Ahouandjenou, 44, and his wife, Valerie, 36, a nurse, said they had
come from Benin a few years ago and opened the clinic two years
ago. He waved at the small bottles of medication he kept on his
desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here don't understand the value of medicine,'' he said,
complaining that he earned only about $2 a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Catholic nuns taught me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ahouandjenou received his training from the Red Cross, he said,
showing an old identification card from 1990. Under his name, the
ID from the Red Cross of Benin declared his profession:
``Cuisinier.'' Cook.
</P>
<P>
   He smiled. A Nigerian doctor had toured the lagoon villages
three years ago and taught him all about medicine. And so
Ahouandjenou, a cook since age 22, had been inspired to switch
careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Continental dishes, that's what I used to prepare,'' he said.
``Pastries! I specialized in pastries!''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Lean, mean and ready to do things differently, Daniel Goldin
came to the office of NASA administrator seven years ago as a
crusader eager to shake up an agency adrift in failure and
mediocrity. His mantra was ``faster, cheaper, better.''
</P>
<P>
   No more behemoths that cost many billions of dollars apiece
would be built to explore outer space. Instead, he vowed to tap
American ingenuity to build swarms of small but powerful spacecraft
that would probe the heavens, sending back a nearly constant stream
of new information. Today, about $100 billion later, the revolution
that Goldin engineered is in a crisis. It has suffered its worst
blows yet with the loss in recent months of a pair of Mars craft _
an orbiter and a lander with two innovative surface probes the size
of cantaloupes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is surprising agreement among NASA officials and
leaders in space exploration that despite its current troubles, the
agency is on course.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin, 59, the longest continuously serving head of NASA, is
zealous, even as he appoints blue-ribbon panels to investigate the
current problems. He says he is chastened by failure but unbowed in
his tenets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got set back,'' he said of the Mars failures in an
interview. ``But we'll pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and
we're going to rock this world. The revolution continues.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that his initiatives had not only produced dozens of
successes in space exploration _ discovering new worlds and probing
many others, from the moon to the galactic maternity wards where
stars are born _ but had also saved taxpayers at least $40 billion.
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen space leaders seemed to echo Goldin's judgment.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of interviews, they said his revolution is basically
sound, if shaken. Plans for the Mars program, shattered by
disaster, are in flux. But no expert foresaw big changes in the
principles of ``faster, cheaper, better,'' or a need for anything
more than relatively minor adjustments in what some call Capt.
Dan's star trek.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some analysts said that the voyage is just beginning to
pick up speed and that big advances lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fell into cutting too many corners,'' said John Beckman,
head of the systems division at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena, Calif., which designed the recently lost spacecraft.
``But the basic process is not broken. There's still a lot to be
gained from increasing our efficiency. I really do believe that
we've barely scratched the surface in terms of what's possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Claude Canizares, chairman of the space studies board at the
National Academy of Sciences and director of the Center for Space
Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, agreed,
saying that on balance the revolution's troubles were worth the
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible that the pendulum has swung too far,'' he said.
``But you can argue that, given the realities of human nature, this
was bound to happen and it's not wholly a bad thing. It helps you
define the limits. Hopefully we can learn from that in terms of
best practices, rather than learning as in a tribunal.''
</P>
<P>
   John Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at George
Washington University, was the most critical, saying that penny
pinching had pushed many teams to the breaking point.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a balance between science return, acceptance of risk
and cost reduction,'' he said. ``Those have gotten out of balance,
with too much emphasis on cost reduction. But the idea of doing
missions more rapidly and at lower cost certainly is still valid.
The issue is how rapidly and how much cost reduction.''
</P>
<P>
   The general upbeat appraisal for ``faster, cheaper, better'' is
all the more remarkable given a rash of failures that began in 1997
and reached a crescendo in past weeks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Two Earth-observing craft, Lewis and Clark, failed in orbit in
1997 and in production in 1998, victims of instrument problems,
testing delays, rising costs and control-system flaws.
</P>
<P>
   _ In December 1998, the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous
spacecraft missed its meeting with Eros, a potato-shaped rock 25
miles long. It is to try again next year.
</P>
<P>
   _ The telescope on the Wide-Field Infrared Explorer satellite
lost its protective cover shortly after launch last March, letting
coolant escape into space and ruining the astronomy mission.
</P>
<P>
   _ In September, a mix-up between English and metric units in
navigation data sent the Mars Climate Orbiter off course and
probably plummeting into the red planet in fiery death.
</P>
<P>
   _ This month, the Mars Polar Lander, consisting of a traditional
probe with retrorockets as well as two small hitchhikers meant to
smash into the planet at 400 mph and survive to send back data,
fell silent as it neared touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   After the latest failures, NASA promised a ``major rethinking''
of the strategy for the Mars program, which could include a
two-year delay in the next landing effort, planned for launching in
2001.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the ominous cast of recent events, more than one analyst
noted that there have been many more successes than failures.
Winners include spacecraft that have studied the moon, the sun, an
asteroid, the Earth's magnetosphere, interstellar clouds,
interplanetary dust and distant stars, and new kinds of engines for
advanced spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   The Mars Pathfinder mission in 1997 became a global sensation as
its plucky little robot, Sojourner, rolled across the Martian soil,
analyzing rocks and sending back stunning photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Howard McCurdy, a space historian at American University who is
working on a book about the Goldin revolution, noted that the total
cost of 16 small missions was about the same as the Cassini
spacecraft, a $3.3 billion colossus of the old school now on its
way to Saturn.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why it's so attractive,'' he said of the revolution.
``You can do 16 missions for price of one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' McCurdy added, ``you lose maybe 20 percent but you're
still ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   The NASA program that is hard to shrink dramatically for safety
reasons, he said, is that of human spaceflight, including the
nation's fleet of space shuttles and the international space
station taking shape in orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Their costs, McCurdy said, dwarf those of the satellites and
probes and account for roughly half the NASA budget, which this
year is $13.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Burns, a planetary scientist at Cornell University, said
the Goldin revolution had considerable merit but was failing to
come to grips with future big-ticket exploratory goals that were
inherently hard to do fast and cheap. Examples he cited were ``a
serious search'' for life on Mars and a major voyage to the outer
solar system, where icy planets and comets hold many clues of
creation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people would still like to do that,'' he said of a
trek to the dark fringes of the sun's realm.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin said his agenda was expanding, not contracting, and that
by design it could continue to embrace risk and failure.
</P>
<P>
   If NASA has 10 winners out of 10 tries, he said, ``we have
mediocre goals.'' Conversely, he added, if two or three ambitious
tries fail while seven or eight succeed, that ``would be
unbelievable success.''
</P>
<P>
   Revolution is difficult but rewarding, he said. Most important,
``it goes on.''

 &HT;    Georgia organization perpetuates gap in gender equity
 &HT;    By Mike Fish and David A. Milliron
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORSYTH, Ga. _ Seated around a horseshoe-shaped conference
table, usually at the Holiday Inn off Interstate 75, the executive
committee of the Georgia High School Association gathers twice a
year to wrestle with everything from the date of the first football
practices to judging criteria for dramatic interpretation and
public speaking.
</P>
<P>
   Much like the high school students whose extracurricular
activities they influence, the committee tends to break into
cliques: a large group of football coaches and athletics directors
at one end of the table, African-Americans in another section and
the two women committee members across from them, side by side.
</P>
<P>
   In 50 years, at least 2,500 people have served on the committee,
which governs after-school functions involving 200,000 Georgia boys
and girls.
</P>
<P>
   Five of them have been women _ two-tenths of 1 percent of the
committee's total membership.
</P>
<P>
   To critics of the GHSA, that gender gap speaks volumes about the
attention the organization gives to girls sports in high schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your aim is to have 50 percent of the participants being
women, then you can't just have two women on the board,'' said
Lucia Norwood, DeKalb County athletics director. ``You don't have
equal representation, for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, women's sports are experiencing exponential growth
at college and professional levels, fueled by such high-visibility
successes as the world championship victory by the U.S. soccer
team. The excitement generated by those successes and the lure of
$200 million annually in college athletics scholarships for women,
have heightened interest in sports among younger girls.
</P>
<P>
   A catalyst for that makeover in women's college athletics is a
27-year-old federal law, Title IX, that requires boys and girls
sports programs be treated equally at schools that receive public
funds.
</P>
<P>
   But in Georgia, an Atlanta Journal-Constitution investigation of
sports funding, participation and coaching suggests that many
schools' boys and girls sports programs are not equal.
</P>
<P>
   Boys coaches commonly are paid significantly more, for example,
and the ratio of students per coach is lower for exclusively boys
sports than for exclusively girls sports, the investigation showed.
</P>
<P>
   Local school districts know there is a federal law and what it
says, state School Superintendent Linda Schrenko said. ``They are
probably in violation of that federal law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't give you a number to go with that,'' she said. ``I can
only tell you that everywhere I go, it seems the predominant sports
are the boys sports, and it seems that the gate receipts go toward
enhancing those sports that are making money. So it's a perpetual
cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very difficult for girls to break into the system.''
</P>
<P>
   The GHSA's critics argue that the association has played an
aggressive role in perpetuating that cycle. They suggest that the
GHSA is first and foremost a defender and proud standard-bearer for
the state's high school football teams. It is also the
organization's biggest revenue producer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know where their profit lies,'' Schrenko said.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the GHSA has been quick to respond to anything its
leadership perceives as a threat to its premier program or its
authority.
</P>
<P>
   The association led opposition in 1994 to a state bill intended
to encourage gender equity in Georgia high school athletics. It
initially fought against the no pass/no play rule intended to put
academics first. It has opposed attempts to eliminate spring
football practice. And, counter to the wishes of the U.S.
Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights, the GHSA
continues to count cheerleading as a competitive sport.
</P>
<P>
   Records show it began including cheerleaders shortly after a
Title IX challenge in Oconee County focused attention on sports
participation rates for boys and girls. Counting cheerleaders
inflated the girls participation rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to upset my friends, but I think they have addressed
the racial part a lot better than they have addressed the gender
issue,'' said Don Hight, a former state Department of Education
representative to the GHSA. ``The mentality probably hasn't changed
to the degree it should.''
</P>
<P>
   GHSA BROUGHT ORDER TO STATE
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia High School Association has existed in some form
since 1905, but it came of age in 1946 with the hiring of Sam
Burke, its first full-time executive director. Since then, the
association has had two other directors.
</P>
<P>
   When Burke came on board, high school sports were a mess. Age
and grades meant nothing for eligibility. The GHSA helped create
order.
</P>
<P>
   Regionally, the GHSA has drawn praise for its strict enforcement
of eligibility standards and for maintaining control of its
private-school members. That is in contrast to Tennessee, where
recruiting battles among private schools are notorious.
</P>
<P>
   Its executive committee decides everything from whether a body
microphone can be used in one-act play competitions to how wide a
spectator's seat must be for hosting a state championship football
or soccer game _ 18 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Although its name might suggest it is a state agency, the GHSA
is a private, nonprofit organization, answerable only to itself. As
such, it is similar to associations set up to serve similar
functions in most other states.
</P>
<P>
   The GHSA is headquartered in a building once used as a dry
cleaner in Thomaston. The association's executive director is Tommy
Guillebeau, a soft-spoken former football coach at Warren County
High School and Americus High School who also was an athletics
director and an administrator in three other school systems.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Guillebeau persuaded Schrenko's state Department
of Education to surrender its control over the eligibility of state
athletes to the GHSA. The move put control of a student's
eligibility firmly in the hands of a private organization, which
already was insulated from parents who might balk at decisions
because of policies that allow only GHSA member schools to appeal
decisions. Parents have no direct access to the organization.
Schrenko maintains that her department's decision to give up its
authority to the GHSA was the right move for the state because it
was duplicating the GHSA's eligibility enforcement efforts.
</P>
<P>
   When Guillebeau negotiated the agreement, GHSA attorney Alan
Connell warned against language implying that the association was a
state agency and possibly subjecting it to the Open Meetings Act.
Connell said that such designation would ``seriously impair the
ability of the GHSA to carry out its function.''
</P>
<P>
   The GHSA is run by Guillebeau, its officers and the executive
committee. The president for the past two decades has been Gary
Holmes, a retired basketball coach and administrator from Glynn
County. The vice president is Walter Wade, a retired football coach
and athletics administrator from the Atlanta city schools who first
joined the executive committee 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   There are no term limits for committee membership, according to
Guillebeau.
</P>
<P>
   Qualifications for being on the committee?
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to be a person,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Guillebeau's executive committee is made up of members elected
from the state's 32 regions, plus seven at-large appointed
positions. The regional members, according to those involved in the
process, are chosen in a loose election process by local athletics
directors, principals and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ORGANIZATION THRIVING
</P>
<P>
   Of the 37 men _ and two women _ on the GHSA executive committee,
three-quarters have football coach on their resume and seven still
pace the sidelines on Friday nights.
</P>
<P>
   During the course of Guillebeau's tenure, the GHSA not only has
increased its authority over high school sports, it has fattened
its coffers. In the past five years, the association has generated
almost $10 million in total revenues, while net assets have
increased 265 percent. It earns $1.5 million a year from high
school tournaments and playoffs, collecting 40 percent off the top
of the state basketball playoffs. It takes what amounts to a
sanctioning fee before expenses from host schools, many of whom
struggle to fund athletics programs. It has sold marketing rights
to Wilson Sporting Goods and designated the MUSCO Co. as an
official lighting company of the GHSA.
</P>
<P>
   Guillebeau concluded a 2-minute director's reportin October by
saying, ``Financially, we're strong, and I think we'll continue to
be strong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an awfully lot richer kingdom than I thought,'' said
DeKalb lawyer Richard Foxworth, who has assisted in filing Title IX
complaints against two GHSA member schools. ``With that kind of
money, they could hire somebody for $50,000 a year to go out and
explain gender equity to the schools.''
</P>
<P>
   To gauge attitudes about gender equity, the GHSA and how the
administration of high school sports are viewed by those closest to
it, the Journal-Constitution surveyed school principals,
superintendents, GHSA executive committee members and coaches.
Ninety-three percent of superintendents, 92 percent of the
executive committee, two-thirds of the state's 323 principals and
936 coaches participated.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the survey showed that the GHSA committee members
reflected the opinions of the folks who elected them. More than 80
percent of principals and more than 90 percent of superintendents
said that female athletes in Georgia schools would not be better
served if there was a state gender-equity law that would allow for
monitoring by the government. Eighty-two percent of GHSA committee
members felt the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the committee members also saw no point in increasing
the number of women on the committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every child is being represented fairly,'' said six-year
member Ronald Dixon, principal of Jeff Davis High School. ``I don't
know how any additional women could enhance the process, but I'm
certainly not against additional women being on there.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't sit well with all member schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems the Georgia High School Association controls
everything, and I think that's a huge issue because it is a
self-perpetuating board,'' said Anne Harper, vice president of the
Atlanta School Board. ``I'm shocked to find that Walter Wade, who
doesn't even work for Atlanta public schools anymore, is GHSA vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's definitely an old football coach from Atlanta, and I
don't think he has a bone in his body that would be thinking about
girls sports.''
</P>
<P>
   NOT ALL COACHES LIKE STATUS QUO
</P>
<P>
   In the varsity coaching ranks, opinions about the GHSA might
best be characterized as lukewarm support. Forty-six percent of
coaches who were surveyed said they were satisfied with the
organization. Thirty-seven percent graded the GHSA's performance as
fair, and 17 percent were dissatisfied with the association.
</P>
<P>
   A sampling of the comments from coaches:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The GHSA has become too powerful and is football/South
Georgia controlled.'' _ a basketball coach
</P>
<P>
   _ ``They are too dictatorial, with no appeal process. God does
not live at GHSA headquarters.'' _ a track coach
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I would form a rival governing body if I thought it had a
prayer.'' _ a soccer coach
</P>
<P>
   Although they included few comments about the GHSA, football and
golf coaches gave the association the highest grades. More than 27
percent said they were very satisfied with the job done by the
GHSA. ``Very professional,'' said one football coach.
</P>
<P>
   In the survey of the GHSA's executive committee, members viewed
their organization as being supportive of gender equity but not in
any way responsible for assuring it. The organization does not
employ a gender-equity coordinator. It sponsors mandatory rules
clinics for coaches _ imposing $50 fines on those who fail to
attend _ but no clinics on how to assure that boys and girls sports
programs are organized equitably.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a role in that,'' Guillebeau said.
</P>
<P>
   More than a third of the 52 state associations surveyed by the
Journal-Constitution, including Washington, D.C., and a separate
all-girls association in Iowa, claim to either monitor or enforce
gender-equity policy. Almost 60 percent said the state education
department monitors or enforces policy in their states, which is
not the case in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that state high school athletic associations certainly
would be a source of where one would expect that there would be
some guidance in terms of compliance, as well as individual high
school districts themselves,'' said Mary Francis O'Shea, Title IX
coordinator for the U.S. Department of Education. ``I know a number
of state high school associations have gender requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   STATE'S HANDS TIED
</P>
<P>
   Georgia School Superintendent Linda Schrenko confirmed the
state's minimal involvement, saying that since funding for
athletics and other extracurricular activities comes from the local
level, and not the state, she is without a stick to enforce
compliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we don't fund it, we can't police it, per se,'' she
said. ``We could, but with what authority? I can go tell them you
ought not to be doing that. But if you can't withhold money or have
some sort of sanction against them, you really have no effect. So
it gets down to that money at the local level.''
</P>
<P>
   And at the local level, the football tradition runs deep. The
surveys offered a glimpse of how deeply the sport is woven into the
administrative fabric of Georgia's public schools. At least
one-third of the state's superintendents reported they previously
had served as football coaches. No other sport or extracurricular
activity came close. An even higher percentage of principals _ 36
percent _ have football coaching backgrounds, the survey showed.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago, the GHSA weathered a significant media storm
over gender equity. The lack of female representation on its
executive committee attracted the attention of some mothers and
fathers of girls who played high school sports. One was WSB-TV news
anchor Monica Kaufman, who has an athletic daughter. The newswoman
was among parents concerned about whether girls sports got a fair
shake in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   She brought a camera crew to the GHSA headquarters in Thomaston
and asked Guillebeau, the executive director, why no women (at that
time) had ever served on the board in its 87-year history.
</P>
<P>
   She said Guillebeau told her he felt it was a problem and ``they
were planning on doing something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   And he did. Soon after, the GHSA appointed two women to its
executive board.
</P>
<P>
   From that day to this one, that seemed like enough.

FOR GORE AND BRADLEY, A GENTLEMANLY DUEL IN FLORIDA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Calif., N.Y., Ohio)  (jw) 
 By JAMES DAO with KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla., _ Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill
Bradley, the Democratic candidates for president, opened a spirited
competition for Florida voters during the weekend, delivering
dueling speeches before the state Democratic convention that, in
gentlemanly language, sharply contrasted their records, styles and
visions for the country.
</P>
<P>
   In a forceful speech before 2,000 party stalwarts Sunday,
Bradley suggested that the vice president would ``shrink back'' and
``tinker around the edges,'' while his own ``bold'' ideas would
rekindle the spirit of three Democratic icons: Woodrow Wilson,
Franklin D. Roosevelt and Robert F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say, `Now is not the time to settle,''' Bradley said,
testing a new refrain in his 35-minute address. ``I'm not prepared
to settle for anything less than making access to health care
affordable to all Americans. I'm not prepared to settle for
anything short of registering and licensing all hand guns in this
country. I'm not prepared to settle for anything less than bringing
all children out of poverty in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats,'' he concluded, ``do not settle.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Gore delivered a 45-minute speech that toned down
his usual sledgehammer attacks on Bradley, apparently out of
respect for Bradley's health after the former senator went to a
California hospital on Friday suffering from a bout of irregular
heart beats.
</P>
<P>
   But without naming his opponent, Gore suggested to his audience
that Bradley's positions on Social Security, education, the budget
and Medicare, the government health care program for the elderly,
were out of sync with traditional Democratic values.
</P>
<P>
   ``I voted against those Reagan-Bush budget cuts,'' Gore said,
omitting his usual criticism of Bradley for supporting them in
1981. ``I fought against the Newt Gingrich Republican Congress,''
he added, invoking questions about Bradley's party loyalty for
retiring from the Senate in 1996, after Gingrich came to power as
speaker.
</P>
<P>
   In another implicit jab at Bradley, Gore said, ``I have never
been afraid to take on the big pharmaceutical companies,'' a
reference to Bradley's repeated Senate votes for measures supported
by the pharmaceutical industry. New Jersey is home to many of the
nation's largest drug companies, and several of them contributed
heavily to Bradley's Senate campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's irregular heartbeats, a chronic condition known as
atrial fibrillation for which he takes daily medication, forced him
to cancel several West Coast events on Friday and Saturday. But his
doctors, who say the condition is not serious, said the
palpitations stopped spontaneously on Friday, without treatment.
Sunday, the candidate look relaxed and energetic. His aides said he
would maintain a busy campaign schedule this week.
</P>
<P>
   The appearance of the two candidates in Florida, the fourth
largest state, underscored the potential importance of its March 14
primary, which falls one week after the primaries in California,
New York, Ohio and several other Northern states. Both men will
have to campaign selectively in March, and this weekend's
convention indicated both are likely to target Florida.
</P>
<P>
   For the Gore camp, Florida offers an important opportunity,
along with other Southern states, to knock Bradley back if he does
well on March 7. The vice president, from Tennessee, is viewed as
the front-runner here and across the South, having locked up
endorsements from many top Democratic state officials like State
Attorney General Bob Butterworth, and the largest unions, including
the 442,000-member state AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley campaign officials assert that they can compete with
Gore in Florida more effectively than in other Southern states
largely because of its many transplanted New York and New Jersey
residents. Bradley represented New Jersey in the Senate for 18
years and played basketball for the New York Knicks for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   In wooing Florida voters now, the two candidates also reflected
a growing concern among many Democrats that the eventual Democratic
nominee might have trouble winning here in November because Gov.
Jeb Bush of Florida is the brother of the Republican presidential
front-runner, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton won the state in 1996, but several polls have
shown George W. Bush leading both Democrats here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their coming here sends a signal that Florida is still viable
for the Democrats,'' said Charles Whitehead, the chairman of the
state Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Whitehead said Sunday he thought that Bradley faced ``an uphill
battle'' in Florida. But he said he thought the former senator was
gaining support, adding, ``I would guess that 75 percent of
Bradley's supporters in the room today were committed to Gore
before the convention. He was very well received today.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Gore's chief message here was to Florida's legions of retired
people, reassuring them that he would stand fast on protecting
Social Security and Medicare, programs he had said Bradley would do
little to defend and might even undermine.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also traded unabashedly on his partnership with Clinton,
who remains popular in Florida and who spoke warmly of Gore to the
conventioneers earlier on Saturday. Gore reminded the audience of
the economic boom of the Clinton years and that Florida supported
the Clinton-Gore re-election in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Clinton and I came in and, with Democratic votes alone,
we changed the policy of our country, and we reordered the
priorities,'' Gore said. ``This kind of progress is not something
that we should just casually toss aside.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley gave his usual stump speech Sunday, but spiced it with a
stronger assertion than usual of his support for Social Security,
Medicaid, Medicare and civil rights protections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there anybody who questions our belief in Social Security,
civil rights, Medicare?'' he asked. ``That's why if find it so
dismaying that one Democrat can attack another on these issues. On
issues that are articles of faith for our party. If we are united
on anything, we have to be united on these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates made strong appeals to black voters, voicing
their support for affirmative action, which has become a hot topic
here. Opponents of the policy are trying to place an initiative on
the ballot that would end the use of racial preferences by state
government and public universities.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates said that they supported giving a visa to the
father of a 6-year-old Cuban boy, Elian Gonzalez, who was rescued
off the Florida coast while escaping to the United States aboard a
boat last month. The boy's mother died on the trip, and he has
become the focus of a battle between his father, who says he wants
him returned to Cuba, and Cuban Americans in Florida who want him
to remain here.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley said the father should be allowed to travel to
the United States so that he can, free of possible coercion by the
Cuban government, express his desire for the return of his son.

 By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Emily Skinner and Alice Ripley can be excused for
sharing a bit of an identity crisis. It's not that they look alike,
sound alike or even dress alike. Ms. Ripley has honey blonde hair,
while Ms. Skinner's is closer to sunshine. And though both women
have blue eyes, you'd never think their genes had jumped from the
same pool.
</P>
<P>
   Still, almost every day someone, somewhere, calls one of them by
the other woman's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you never call me Emily,'' Ms. Ripley announces to a
reporter, ``you'll be my favorite person ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Such confusion is not inexplicable. After all, it was just two
years ago that Ms. Skinner and Ms. Ripley burst onto Broadway
literally connected at the hip.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion, of course, was ``Side Show,'' the ill-fated
musical about Daisy and Violet Hilton, conjoined twins and
Depression-era vaudevillians whose physical deformity failed to
hide their humanity or, apparently, their deep urge to belt out a
tune. The actresses earned a joint Tony nomination for playing
Daisy and Violet, side by side.
</P>
<P>
   It was, as they say, a bonding experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``How did we get to know one another?'' Ms. Skinner said with a
smile. ``When you have your backside plastered to another girl's
for eight hours a day, it's sort of natural.''
</P>
<P>
   Though ``Side Show'' lasted only seven weeks, the Broadway
community's mental connection between Ms. Skinner and Ms. Ripley
has endured. And that association is likely to intensify now that
the two find themselves on Broadway again in ``James Joyce's `The
Dead,''' the musical adaptation of the Joyce short story that
begins a limited engagement at the Belasco Theater on Tuesday
night..
</P>
<P>
   The end result of which is that the former twins are once again
sharing a dressing room, albeit with a little more room to breathe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing,'' said Ms. Skinner, pointing to Ms. Ripley's
left cheek. ``I've only ever seen that side of her face.''
</P>
<P>
   The roles the women play in ``The Dead'' are a far cry from
their ``Side Show'' personae. Ms. Ripley plays Miss Molly Ivors, a
spunky Irish lass whose flirtation raises the body temperature of
Gabriel Conroy, the play's central character, played by Christopher
Walken.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Skinner, meanwhile, is Mary Jane, a kindly niece whose
Christmas celebration sets the scene for the play. The two
characters never speak directly to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the two women see themselves, as actresses, falling
into distinctly different categories. Ms. Skinner said that Ms.
Ripley was a ``classic young leading lady'' with high, angular
cheekbones and a bright, brassy voice that recalls Barbara Cook or
Shirley Jones. (This description elicited a large ``Awwww'' from a
grateful Ms. Ripley.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Skinner, meanwhile, is the more rosy-cheeked of the two, the
possessor of a beaming smile and a voice that Ms. Ripley described
as ``like a warm reed instrument.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beautiful,'' Ms. Ripley said. ``I envy her.''
</P>
<P>
   The two have put their voices to work in two albums of duets and
solo versions of songs drawn from Broadway shows.
</P>
<P>
   The latest, ``Unsuspecting Hearts'' (Varese Sarabande), was
released in September and features 15 songs, including ``She's
Gone,'' which was cut from ``Side Show,'' and the album's title
song, which was drawn from the astoundingly unsuccessful musical
version of ``Carrie.''
</P>
<P>
   Their first album, ``Duets'' (Varese Sarabande), was released in
1998 and is the label's third-highest-selling Broadway album ever.
</P>
<P>
   Both recordings were presented in a way that seemed geared to
cash in on their Siamese past. The cover of ``Unsuspecting Hearts''
shows the two women wrapped in a seamless red blanket, their
shoulders nearly blended together. For ``Duets,'' their faces are
pressed cheek-to-cheek.
</P>
<P>
   Still, their appearance together in ``The Dead,'' which is
transferring from Playwrights Horizons, was almost accidental. Ms.
Ripley's part was one of the first cast, said the producer, Gregory
Mosher, while Ms. Skinner's was one of the last.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I realized the whole `Side Show' connection, I thought,
`Wow, what a brilliant idea,''' Mosher said. ``Then I thought, `Oh,
no, do they like one another?' I mean, sharing a body part could
breed the greatest of friends or someone you really, really don't
want to see a lot of.''
</P>
<P>
   The reminders of their shared past are constant. Casting agents
call for one, wanting the other. Schedule changes are called in to
Ms. Skinner and expected to be passed on to Ms. Ripley. Neither set
of parents has slipped yet, but it seems only a matter of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've warned my husband,'' Ms. Ripley said.
</P>
<P>
   The two actresses have become good friends, though they say a
deeper, more normal friendship blossomed only  &UR; after  &LR; the pressure
of ``Side Show'' had faded.
</P>
<P>
   ``People used to ask us, `So do you guys hang out together?'''
Ms. Skinner said. ``I mean, the last thing we want to do after
being stuck together is be like, `Hey, want to get our nails
done?'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ripley continued, ``What's nice about `The Dead' is that it
lets us actually get to know one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Skinner added: ``That's lovely you felt that way, but I felt
I knew you before. I knew everything I should know, and everything
I shouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The women do display an uncanny, almost sisterly talent for
finishing each other's sentences, and enough spunk to tease each
other into laughter. Asked how they became actresses, Ms. Skinner
and Ms. Ripley answered like this:
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Skinner: ``I've never really had any other life dream or
plan than to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ripley: ``Good thing it worked out for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Skinner: ``I know. Really.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ripley: ``You could've ended up working at the 7-Eleven.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Skinner: ``Easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Skinner, a native of Richmond, Va., who said she was born to
two ``very normal people,'' was a child actress who earned her
Equity card, a badge of professionalism, at the age of 12. She has
one sister, Eliza.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ripley, meanwhile, comes from a large family, 11 children in
all, and spent her childhood in several cities in Ohio. Her
professional training came at Kent State University. After working
as an actress in San Diego, she moved to Nashville to pursue a
singing career. Instead she found her husband, Shannon Ford, a jazz
and rock drummer.
</P>
<P>
   Both women arrived in New York in 1992 and quickly found work,
with Ms. Skinner landing in a workshop of ``Jekyll and Hyde'' and
Ms. Ripley taking an understudy role on Broadway in ``The Who's
`Tommy.'''
</P>
<P>
   Their collective break came in 1996, when ``Side Show,'' which
was then called the ``The Song of the Siamese Twins,'' was in
workshops. Ms. Skinner had played Daisy in several early readings,
but her Violets kept wilting away. Finally the creative team
brought in Ms. Ripley for an audition. The effect of their voices
together _ ``the blend,'' as Robert Longbottom, the director, put
it _ was immediate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really finished each other,'' Longbottom said.
``Everybody in the room just knew: there it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite good reviews and the Tony nomination, ``Side Show''
proved to have less presence than Ms. Skinner and Ms. Ripley. Since
then Ms. Ripley has done a stint as Fantine in ``Les Miserables,''
while Ms. Skinner has had roles in regional theater productions of
``Jesus Christ Superstar'' and ``Working.''
</P>
<P>
   And while the name switch and identity blend may get a little
tiresome, Ms. Ripley and Ms. Skinner say, in their own way, that
they enjoy each other's company.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ripley: ``I'm sort of like, I'm to the point, it's
like....'' Ms. Skinner: ``There could be worse people to be linked
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ripley: ``Exactly.''

LLOYD RODWIN, 80, AUTHORITY ON URBAN STUDIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Ind., Calif.)  (lb) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lloyd Rodwin, an internationally influential authority on urban
studies and planning, died on Tuesday at Massachusetts General
Hospital in Boston. He was 80 and lived in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was congestive heart failure, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodwin retired in 1988 as Ford International professor of urban
studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he
taught for four decades and was chairman of the department of urban
studies and planning for several years.
</P>
<P>
   At the MIT-Harvard Joint Center for Urban Studies, which he
co-founded in 1959, he worked with Daniel Patrick Moynihan before
Moynihan became a Democratic senator from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Rodwin ``was hugely influential,'' the senator recalled on
Thursday, and his chief impact on his field of expertise was that
``he redefined the study of cities, defined them in terms of the
people who lived there rather than the buildings in which they
lived.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a great teacher of professors,'' Moynihan said, who
``broke the iron hold of urban studies,'' as it had been defined,
in terms of ``laying out a grand city, or a grand suburb.''
</P>
<P>
   The main impetus for that earlier way of thinking came from the
Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago, the senator said. The
fair's splendid grounds featured grand vistas and buildings
reminiscent of ancient Rome. It embodied the style of urban design
called the City Beautiful movement.
</P>
<P>
   But ``by the time we had the joint center going, the cities
weren't all that beautiful, and never had been,'' Moynihan said,
and the subject of urban planning ``was still abstract and quite
removed from any of the realities of urban life in the second half
of the 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   Another MIT urbanist, Bernard Frieden, said: ``Lloyd really
changed the field from city planning to urban studies. He
emphasized research on how cities work. Lloyd made the field much
broader and extended it to the Third World.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodwin and Kevin Lynch, also of MIT, wrote in a 1961 essay:
``Men are attracted to the metropolis by real values _ choice,
freedom, privacy, opportunity, culture, entertainment. How can we
ensure the realization of these ends? More importantly, what are
the possibilities for metropolitan life that are as yet undreamed
of? And what kind of power, knowledge or guidance must be applied
to achieve them? The spirit of hopeful intervention should prove at
least as effective as the desire to escape present discomfort.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodwin was known for his studies of regional and urban
quandaries in the developing world. According to the journal
Planning, an entire city in Venezuela, the port complex Ciudad
Guayana, ``was planned with the assistance of a group of North
Americans led by Lloyd Rodwin'' in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   He was also an adviser to the United Nations and the author,
co-author, editor or co-editor of 10 books.
</P>
<P>
   Born in New York, he received a bachelor's degree from City
College there and a doctorate in regional planning from Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Nadine Posniak Rodwin; two sons,
Victor, of New York, and Marc Andre, of Bloomington, Ind.; a
daughter, Julie Anne Rodwin, of Groton, Mass.; a brother, Ted
Rosenbaum; a sister, Claire Levy, of Laguna Hills, Calif., and six
grandchildren.

 &HT;    Georgia treats girl athletes second-class
 &HT;    By Mike Fish and David A. Milliron
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In 1972, the year when women first were allowed to
serve as FBI agents and the Equal Rights Act was passed by
Congress, something called Title IX became federal law.
</P>
<P>
   It mandated that school athletics programs for boys and girls be
given comparable support.
</P>
<P>
   More than 27 years later, gender equity still is not the
standard in most Georgia high schools.
</P>
<P>
   Not even close.
</P>
<P>
   The association in charge of high school athletics in Georgia
says ensuring a fair distribution of resources to boys and girls
sports is not and should not be its responsibility. In a survey,
the association's executive committee said policing gender-equity
issues isn't the responsibility of the state, and the association
has lobbied aggressively to prevent passage of a state Title IX
law.
</P>
<P>
   State officials say that with no state law, they have no
authority to act. Federal authorities say that if there is no local
enforcement, they rely on parents. They suggest that parents who
cannot get help locally contact the U.S. Department of Education's
Office for Civil Rights.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution shows that
girls' participation rates in high school sports have grown in
recent years. But it indicates a majority of Georgia's public high
schools would not pass muster if they faced a federal gender-equity
challenge. The newspaper looked at participation levels, funding,
quality of facilities and coaching support for high school boys and
girls sports _ and found gender inequities to be commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia high schools, girls slightly outnumber boys.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the newspaper found:
</P>
<P>
   _ 75 percent of local salary supplements for coaching goes to
support boys sports, while 25 percent goes to girls programs.
</P>
<P>
   _ 95 percent of so-called ``extended pay'' supplements
(amounting to more than $12 million per year in additional
financial support for coaches) goes to the coaches of boys sports.
Girls programs get 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ For football, an almost exclusively male sport, the ratio of
students per coach statewide is 9-to-1. For softball and
volleyball, exclusively female sports, the ratio is 12-to-1.
</P>
<P>
   _ 64 percent of athletes are boys; 36 percent are girls.
</P>
<P>
   The state's top school official says she thinks a case could be
made that nearly every public high school in the state might be in
violation of Title IX.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the good ol' boy system,'' says Georgia School
Superintendent Linda Schrenko. ``And good ol' boys have traditional
roles for girls that don't include athletics.''
</P>
<P>
   The superintendent says she has little authority to make
improvements and suggests the Legislature to date has worked harder
to preserve the status quo than to change it.
</P>
<P>
   One thing the federal law does require is that local school
districts designate a Title IX coordinator. In a survey, one-fourth
of school superintendents acknowledged they did not have a
coordinator. And in those districts where superintendents did have
a designated coordinator, word hasn't always trickled down.
Fifty-five percent of principals who were surveyed said they were
unaware of a coordinator in their district.
</P>
<P>
   At the collegiate level, Title IX has brought huge changes to
women's athletics, with more than $200 million now available in
athletic scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   As is the case with boys, the benefits of girls' participation
in sports are well-documented. Studies show that involvement in
sports for girls leads to higher self-esteem and confidence, lowers
pregnancy rates, creates more positive attitudes toward school and
reduces destructive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   In a number of states, including neighboring Florida, gender
equity has become part of the high school athletics culture. Last
year in Florida, female participation in high school sports
increased 24 percent, according to officials. Florida has had a
state gender-equity law since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Sports participation rates for high school girls in Florida are
six percentage points higher than in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia has been slow to embrace the cultural shift. For
generations, what happens beneath Friday night lights on a high
school football field has helped define a community. High school
football rules, particularly in rural Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   In a building once used by a dry cleaner in Thomaston, a private
group led mostly by current and former football coaches has worked
to uphold that tradition.
</P>
<P>
   This group is the Georgia High School Association. The GHSA is a
private, nonprofit organization with millions in assets, garnered
from tournament profits, annual dues and high school sports
marketing agreements, financial statements show.
</P>
<P>
   The decisions made by the association directly affect the lives
of hundreds of thousands of Georgia students in public and private
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Football is the revenue leader that drives the GHSA. For
example, the state's high school football playoffs, played this
weekend at the Georgia Dome, are expected to generate about
$500,000 for the GHSA.
</P>
<P>
   Its executive board of 37 men and two women is particularly
expert in football; at least 72 percent of the members are or were
football coaches, according to a Journal-Constitution survey.
</P>
<P>
   But the GHSA governs more than football. It oversees all
extracurricular activities in Georgia high schools _ from drama and
debate competitions to baseball schedules and volleyball clinics.
Two years ago, the private group secured additional authority from
the state to decide who can participate in extracurricular school
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Parents who do not like the GHSA decisions can ask their local
school officials to appeal, but parents cannot go before the GHSA
on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Former state School Superintendent Werner Rogers says the GHSA
deserves credit for assuming a role the state was hard put to fill.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've provided a great service to the schools and school
systems by organizing interscholastic sports,'' he says. ``By
having stringent rules and holding people to them, they have pretty
much controlled the misuse of athletes, playing kids not eligible,
etc.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the GHSA's efforts, coaches say, Georgia is a very
good state to grow up in if you are a boy interested in football.
The state ranks as a leading feeder system for collegiate football
ranks and the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   But some argue the GHSA's actions have slowed the growth of
girls high school sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, more work needs to be done for the girls programs,''
says Mary Francis O'Shea, national Title IX coordinator for the
U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Schrenko says the Legislature has helped perpetuate inequities
between boys and girls athletics by using the state Department of
Community Affairs as a pork-barrel vehicle for funding
brick-and-mortar projects that tend to favor boys sports.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal-Constitution examined the legislative grants made
during a five-year period for stadiums, lighting, field houses,
equipment and the like. The newspaper found that 86 percent of the
dollars were directed to projects where the primary beneficiaries
are boys sports.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the athletics director and assistant principal of
Macon County High was asked whether a $100,000 grant from the state
Legislature to expand the football stadium prompted any concerns
about gender equity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gender equity,'' Tommy Moore says, considering the idea. ``We
got girls in the band. The cheerleaders are girls. Half the people
in the stands are girls. We hold graduation in the stadium, and
half the graduates are girls. Our managers are girls; our
statisticians are girls.''

IOC BANS TRIPS TO BIDDING CITIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ Three days before he faces a certain
grilling from the U.S. Congress, Juan Antonio Samaranch gained an
important political victory Sunday by persuading members of the
International Olympic Committee to give up one of their most
cherished and abused privileges _visiting cities that are bidding
on the Winter and Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   When Samaranch, the president of the IOC, appears on Capitol
Hill on Wednesday, he will now be able to assert that the
organization has instituted an extensive package of reforms a year
after the Salt Lake City bribery scandal. At the same time,
delegates cautioned Sunday that much more work needed to be done to
restore public trust in the Olympic movement and that substantial
change does not guarantee the prevention of abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Roland Baar, a gold medalist rower from Germany elected Sunday
to the IOC, said the reforms were ``a kind of probation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The world and the athletes will check the results very
precisely,'' Baar said.
</P>
<P>
   The willing acceptance of millions of dollars in cash payments,
scholarships, free medical care and other gifts from Salt Lake City
bid officials has come to represent the widespread perception of
the IOC as an arrogant and unaccountable organization. Ten members
resigned or were expelled, and another 10 received warnings in the
worst crisis of the modern Olympics. A continuing investigation by
the U.S. Justice Department has resulted in two indictments related
to allegations that people involved in the Salt Lake City bid gave
a sham job to the son of Kim Un-yong of South Korea, a prominent
IOC member.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch has agreed to speak with FBI agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took a political decision today,'' said Mario Pescante, an
Italian who is a member of the IOC. ``At the moment of voting,
there was a very intense feeling that this was very important to
strengthen the position of the president. The strength of the
president is our strength. Going before the United States Congress,
it is very important that he can prove that we made important
reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   Had he not been able to end the visits, or push through age and
so-called term limits for IOC members, Samaranch would have
substantially increased his vulnerability when he appears before
the House Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations,
headed by Rep Fred Upton, R-Mich. Samaranch will still most likely
face tough questioning on subjects ranging from his role in Spain's
Franco regime to a $12,000 side trip that his wife and a friend
took to Charleston, S.C., in 1990, while Atlanta was bidding on the
1996 Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enacting a package of reforms as a whole is his best ally,''
said Kevan Gosper of Australia, a member of the committee's
executive board.
</P>
<P>
   After two hours of debate Sunday on the issue of visits,
Samaranch used shrewd manipulation to ban them when the issue came
to a vote. Instead of asking which delegates were against the
trips, Samaranch asked who favored them, forcing those who would
oppose him to raise their hands. Only 10 of 100 delegates did.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did what we promised,'' Samaranch said of the reform
package enacted over two days of meetings here. But he also
acknowledged that the Salt Lake City scandal was the ``catalyst for
reform that we should have seen as necessary a long time
beforehand.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, considerable change has been made in the IOC in
the last year. The committee has opened its meetings, made
financial records available, started a worldwide doping agency,
banned visits to bidding cities, forced the delegates to face
re-election every eight years, restricted future members to an age
limit of 70, limited future presidents to a maximum of 12 years in
office, enacted an ethics commission, implemented a code of conduct
and selected 12 active athletes to its assembly. Officials from bid
cities can also no longer visit IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Mr. Samaranch goes to Washington as president of a
renovated, renewed, transparent, rejuvenated, more democratic
IOC,'' said Jacques Rogge of Belgium, a vice president of the
committee and a possible successor to Samaranch. ``That is not a
bad position to start with.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the IOC remains essentially the same
organization it was before the weekend, and the period while the
reforms are implemented could be considerable. Skeptics have
questioned whether the IOC is committed to reform or is simply
acting out of political expediency under pressure from corporate
sponsors, lawmakers and the news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have changed rules, but that is not enough; we also have to
change behavior,'' Rogge said. ``Reputations are not made by rules
and amendments; reputations are made on a day to day basis by the
individual behavior of every member. I'm confident we will prove
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics contend that the committee could even become more
insular with so-called term limits, because delegates might be
reluctant to agitate their colleagues and risk not being
re-elected. Even though 10 delegates were removed in the past year,
most were from developing nations; insiders such as Phil Coles of
Australia and Kim were given only warnings.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC also has admitted being far behind in research to combat
the use of performance-enhancing drugs. One of the athletes elected
Sunday, Manuela Di Centa, who won two gold medals for Italy in
cross-country at the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway,
has been linked to an investigation by an Italian judge into the
use of the performance-enhancing endurance drug EPO. She has denied
using the drug.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 30 delegates have been implicated in various
improprieties linked to bids by Salt Lake City to host the 2002
Winter Games, Atlanta's hosting of the 1996 Summer Games and
Sydney's bid for the 2000 Summer Games. Even so, Syed Shahid Ali, a
delegate from Pakistan, Sunday blamed the ``Satanic'' practices of
bid cities for creating the climate of excessive favors.
</P>
<P>
   Despite new professions of openness, the IOC would not provide a
list of the 10 delegates who voted against the ban on visits.
Reporters were forced to watch from another room on closed-circuit
television. One vocal opponent, Princess Anne of Britain, said the
ban would be unenforceable because many delegates would still visit
the cities in other capacities as sports officials. She called the
ban ``nonsense,'' saying it was passed ``because it has been deemed
necessary to put on a public performance of how to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   One delegate, Lambis W. Nikolaou of Greece, urged Samaranch not
to appear before Congress, saying that it might be seen as a sign
of weakness and that, as president of the IOC, Samaranch was
``accountable only to the Olympic family.'' However, the
79-year-old Samaranch said he was ready to answer any and all
questions. He is buttressed by having pushed through 50 reform
proposals this weekend, all by votes that were unanimous or an
overwhelming majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not thinking of Congress,'' Samaranch said. ``We were
only thinking of the future of the IOC.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch repeated that he planned to remain as president until
his term ends on July 16, 2001, exactly 21 years after he was
elected. Saying that the newly enacted reforms would make the IOC
``more open, more transparent, younger, in short more modern,'' he
also acknowledged, ``We recognize there has been a breach of trust
between the IOC and the public, and that it will take some time to
heal.'' &QL;

OH, CANADA! VANCOUVER MAKES THE CULINARY `EH'-LIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I learned at an early age that there were plenty of wonderful
things to see and do in western Canada. It was a wonderful place to
visit, but you really wouldn't want to eat there.
</P>
<P>
   At least half the restaurants in Alberta advertised
``Canadian-Chinese food,'' which suggested chow mein topped with
maple syrup. You couldn't buy a decent hamburger in British
Columbia. Restaurants offered hot dogs but then served ``bangers''
_ seasoned sawdust in a pig's intestine. Meat pies in Vancouver
delis were cheap and about as tasty as a donkey's ear.
</P>
<P>
   Only lately, after numerous research excursions north of the
border, have I erased these prejudices to the point where I might
suggest that Vancouver may be the best restaurant city north of San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Don't laugh. Instead, visit Robson or Denman streets at 10 p.m.
on a Tuesday night. The stores are open, the restaurants are doing
gold-rush business and, unless it is pouring rain, locals jam the
sidewalks four abreast.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver's population has topped 2 million and is climbing.
Construction cranes are as numerous as Starbucks outlets. During a
Vancouver visit, Bette Midler nominated the city as the coffee
capital of North America.
</P>
<P>
   In a seven-block span on Robson there are 41 restaurants, by
recent count. Turn the corner and travel another seven blocks on
Denman and you pass 50 more restaurants offering cuisine from every
corner of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen or 20 years ago our favorite Vancouver ``discoveries''
included Hy's steakhouse, the William Tell, a First Nation
restaurant named Muckamuck, Umberto's and Cafe de Paris, which
offered the best pommes frites in the world and a stunning dish
featuring rabbit in red wine.
</P>
<P>
   More recent recollections include giant scallops wrapped in
octopus ``bacon'' with shiitake mushroom cakes and truffle oil at C
Restaurant; a Dungeness crab and shrimp cake with arugula pesto and
smoked lentils at the Beach Side Cafe in a neighborhood known as
Ambleside; breast of duck with a roasted pear tart at Diva at the
Met; Double Belgian Chocolate Truffle and Fudge Cake at Seasons
Restaurant in Queen Elizabeth Park, where Bill Clinton and Boris
Yeltsin put on a few pounds at lunch during the 1993 summit
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the best eatery in Vancouver is supposed to be Le Crocodile,
unless it is Bishop's, Chartwell, Cin Cin Restorante or one of the
other establishments mentioned above. And there are probably as
many quality Chinese restaurants as you would find in San Francisco
or New York.
</P>
<P>
   But do not believe the tour guides who swear that the yellow
pile identified as sulfur across the bay from Stanley Park is
actually a stockpile of Canadian powdered eggs, ready for export to
all the fast-food franchises in Seattle and Portland, rivals for
the Pacific Northwest Gutbuster Award.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a major appetite but a minor bankroll, skip the
expensive restaurants and fulfill your lust in your own kitchen
with dishes such as these.
</P>
<P>
   Robson Risotto
</P>
<P>
   1 and one-half cups Arborio rice
</P>
<P>
   5 cups chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup minced red onion
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chopped fresh mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   1 medium clove garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup chopped sun-dried tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter teaspoon powdered saffron
</P>
<P>
   1 and one-quarter cup chopped smoked chicken
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon butter
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   You usually can find smoked chicken in some form at major
grocery stores. Or throw an extra bird on the grill the next time
you roast whole chicken on your barbecue, then reserve the
leftovers for this dish.
</P>
<P>
   Wash and drain the rice a couple of times. Heat the broth and
keep it at a simmer.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a heavy pot and saute the onions and mushrooms,
about 5 minutes. Add the drained rice, the garlic and the sun-dried
tomatoes. (Use the tomatoes that are packed in olive oil. If you
use packaged dry tomatoes, they must be reconstituted according to
package instructions.)
</P>
<P>
   Stir-cook the rice and other ingredients 2 minutes. Stir in the
wine and cook at medium-high heat until most of the liquid is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Add a half-cup slurp of hot broth to the pan. When it is almost
all cooked away, add another half cup of broth containing the
saffron. When this is almost cooked away, add half cup more broth
and so on, until the rice is tender to the tooth. The cooking
process should last about 25 minutes and will keep you busy in the
kitchen while all the guests are clinking glasses, whooping and
hollering in the other room. Use just as much broth as you need to
achieve a creamy risotto. It should not be soupy.
</P>
<P>
   Stir in the smoked chicken, and when it has had time to warm up,
stir in the butter and Parmesan, plus salt and pepper to taste.
</P>
<P>
   Burrard Beefsteaks
</P>
<P>
   2 steaks, about 1 inch thick
</P>
<P>
   Salt, pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon canola oil
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped shallots
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup red wine
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon butter
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper the steaks. Heat the oil in a skillet, then
brown the steaks 4 minutes on each side for rare, 6 minutes on each
side for medium.
</P>
<P>
   Remove steaks from pan and pour off all but 1 tablespoon of oil.
Add the shallots and cook 1 minute. Stir in the wine and boil until
reduced by half. Blend in the butter and parsley.
</P>
<P>
   Return the steaks to the pan, turning once to coat with the
sauce, and serve immediately. Add a tossed salad with a blue cheese
dressing and you have a terrific dinner, whether it's served in
North Vancouver or West Seattle.

INDIANA OVERCOMES FATIGUE AND SANTA CLARA FOR NCAA MEN'S TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ The play that decided the men's collegiate
soccer championship Sunday and brought Indiana University its
second consecutive title with a 1-0 triumph over Santa Clara was
originated and executed by Yuri Lavrinenko, a senior midfielder
from Ukraine, who had a little help from another Ukrainian, Aleksei
Korol.
</P>
<P>
   Lavrinenko started the play in the 30th minute with a marvelous
35-yard run down the left side. After dribbling with authority
around several players, he relayed the ball to Korol at the top of
the penalty area and kept on running.
</P>
<P>
   The diminutive Korol returned the pass, and Lavrinenko used the
outside of his right foot to slide the ball under Santa Clara
goalkeeper Rusty Johnson from 7 yards for the day's only goal
before 15,439 at Ericsson Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got the ball in midfield and I started dribbling,''
said Lavrinenko, the tournament's outstanding offensive player, ``I
was looking to pass right away. But my teammates opened up space
and I continued running. When I played the ball to Aleksei, two
players went to him and it opened up more space for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Lavrinenko's goal, his third of the tournament and seventh of
the season, caught Santa Clara's defense off guard during a
counterattack after Indiana gained possession in midfield. ``They
countered so quickly, and it was one of the few times our guys
didn't get in there,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Santa Clara was so well organized defensively they made it
very difficult to play against them,'' said Coach Jerry Yeagley,
who has led Indiana to five national titles in his 27 years as
coach of the Hoosiers. ``It's a credit to their players and ours,
who had the heart and perseverance to play like that after the
semifinals.''
</P>
<P>
   Both teams were engaged in quadruple overtime in Friday night's
semifinals. It took Indiana 141 minutes 24 seconds to eliminate
UCLA by 3-2, and Santa Clara needed 138 minutes 50 seconds to
eliminate Connecticut by 2-1. The two teams were so physically and
mentally drained after the semifinals that fatigue was a factor
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Garcia, Indiana's junior sweeper, held up better than most.
He was solid throughout the match and had enough energy in the 70th
minute to clear the ball off his line with a desperation header
that nicked the crossbar and bounced away.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia was voted the tournament's outstanding defender for the
second year in a row, primarily because of that effort, and he was
the focus of questions afterward, not because of his heroics on the
field but because he declared that he would follow the professional
route and not return to Indiana for his senior year.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Mitch Murray of Santa Clara (16-4-3) said his team had to
play its best to defeat Indiana, and it didn't. He credited
Indiana's defense for the victory. Indiana, he said, was
outstanding, but ``overphysical.''
</P>
<P>
   The referee, Brian Hall, issued four cautions (yellow cards),
none for blatant fouls, and Indiana (21-3-0) had three of them.
Murray acknowledged that ``there was no intention to hurt anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   By capturing the title for the second year in a row, the
Hoosiers joined St. Louis, San Francisco and Virginia as the only
teams to repeat. Virginia's four consecutive triumphs from 1991 to
1994 is a record that may never be matched.

children from &UR; autism, a developmental disorder that has baffled

SUSPENSION OF FORDHAM PLAYER HELPS TO MAKE UCONN'S VICTORY EASIER 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JACK CAVANAUGH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STORRS, Conn. _ Fordham, which may not even be the best college
team in the Bronx, went up against a Connecticut team Sunday that
is ranked sixth in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   What appeared to be a mismatch when the game was scheduled
became even more so when Fordham's best player, the junior guard
Bevon Robin, was suspended Sunday morning by Coach Bob Hill,
apparently for missing the team's curfew Saturday night. The
presence of Robin, the Rams' second-leading scorer and rebounder,
would probably not have changed the outcome of the game as
Connecticut (7-1) posted its seventh straight victory, by 94-75,
before a crowd of 10,027 at Gampel Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies scored the first 8 points and led by 25 in the first
half and 27 in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's interior defense forced Fordham (4-4) to to shoot
often from the perimeter. The Rams took 25 shots from 3-point range
but made only six, while shooting 37 percent against 56.5 percent
by the Huskies, who tried only eight 3-pointers and made one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had guys who were scared at the beginning,'' said Hill,
adding that UConn's size was ``a major factor.''
</P>
<P>
   If Fordham was off target from the perimeter, it was not much
better inside or in its transition game. The Rams, who have lost
three straight games after winning four in a row, managed only 28
points inside, as against 50 for Connecticut, and 9 second-chance
points compared with 20 for the Huskies. And Fordham made only 2
points off its fast break, while UConn scored 22.
</P>
<P>
   With Calhoun substituting often, 11 Huskies scored, led by
center Jake Voskuhl (16 points on 5-of-6 shooting and a team-high 8
rebounds) and forward Kevin Freeman (16 points). Guard Khalid
El-Amin scored 10 points on 4-of-9 shooting and dished off a
game-high eight assists.
</P>
<P>
   Robin's absence put an inordinate load on Fordham's other
outstanding guard and leading scorer this season, the 5-foot-9-inch
junior Jason Harris, and forced Hill to start the little-used Ray
Carroll. Harris, who averaged 20 points a game and connected on 29
of 67 3-point shots through the Rams' first seven games, made only
four of 15 field-goal attempts _ all of them from 3-point range _
and had a team-high 15 points.
</P>
<P>
   But as UConn Coach Jim Calhoun said: ``Harris tried to carry so
much himself. He's a terrific player, but he tried to do too
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill, in his first year as the Fordham coach after coaching the
Knicks, the Indiana Pacers and the San Antonio Spurs in the
National Basketball Association, agreed with Calhoun.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made a huge difference because, without Bevon, we had no
true point guard and were forced to play a halfcourt game, and
couldn't play the style of basketball we're accustomed to, which is
to run the court like UConn does,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the one-game suspension of Robin, who sat on the Rams'
bench in street clothes, Hill said, ``We have team rules and
everybody has to respect them.''

GROUP BANNED ELSEWHERE IN CHINA MEETS IN HONG KONG 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ In mainland China, their group has been outlawed,
their spiritual leader vilified, and 150 of his followers arrested
for supposedly subverting Chinese society. But in Hong Kong on
Sunday, 900 members of the Falun Gong movement gathered in a
convention hall for a tranquil demonstration of its breathing and
meditation exercises.
</P>
<P>
   It was the largest public meeting of Falun Gong believers on
Chinese soil since China cracked down on the group in July. And it
put the local authorities in something of a bind.
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong is legal in Hong Kong, and the group obtained
permission for Sunday's meeting. But China has banned the group and
detained many of its members, saying it is cultlike and has a
political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   China's senior representative here said in a radio interview
that he believed the group was using Hong Kong as a base to expand
its activities within China. The official, Ma Yuzhen, noted that
the meeting attracted followers from around the world to this
semiautonomous Chinese territory.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, issued a stern
warning, saying Falun Gong members ``must not act in any manner
that is against the interest of China, Hong Kong, or `one country,
two systems.''' That phrase refers to the arrangement under which
this former British colony retained its own laws and control of its
domestic affairs after reverting to Chinese rule in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the strong words, the Hong Kong authorities left the
group alone during the past weekend. There was a heavy police
presence around the convention center, but the police did not
interfere with the meeting. On Saturday, more than 600 followers
marched and meditated in front of the offices of the Chinese state
news agency, the mainland's unofficial outpost here, also without
interference.
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong representatives, who held a crowded news conference
after Sunday's meeting, dismissed suggestions that Hong Kong was a
staging ground for China.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not pull together to overthrow anyone,'' said Zenon
Dolnyckyj, 21, an intense Canadian who wept earlier in the day as
he recounted his own healing experiences with Falun Gong. ``There
is absolutely no political motivation to Falun Gong. The only
motivation is truthfulness, compassion, and tolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong, which combines traditional Chinese breathing and
meditation exercises with an idiosyncratic blend of Buddhism and
Taoism, has been a political hot button in China since April, when
10,000 followers silently assembled in front of the communist
leaders' compound in Beijing in a demonstration to seek government
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   In late July, the government banned the group and issued an
arrest warrant for its founder, Li Hongzhi, who lives in New York.
</P>
<P>
   China has mounted a relentless propaganda campaign against Li, a
48-year-old former grain-bureau clerk, describing him as a
charlatan whose teachings lead to mental illness and suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The government has rounded up more than 35,000 followers of
Falun Gong, who still turn out sporadically to practice their
exercises in Tiananmen Square. Most of those are sent either home
or to re-education camps. Officials said they had formally arrested
150 people, who will face prosecution under new anti-cult laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government says Falun Gong is a vast and
well-organized cult that poses a ``massive threat'' to Chinese
society. Although the group uses the Internet to publicize meetings
and mobilize its followers to rally against the crackdown by China,
its representatives insist that Falun Gong is not a formal
organization and has no bank account, membership rolls or
leadership committee.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dolnyckyj said individual followers had rented the hall on
behalf of the group. The managing director of the Hong Kong
Convention and Exhibition Center, Cliff Wallace, confirmed that the
rent of nearly $13,000 was paid with personal checks.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said the Hong Kong government did not question his
decision to rent the hall to the group. He said he requested extra
security because he worried that outside elements might seek to
capitalize on a large gathering of people and the intense
news-media attention.
</P>
<P>
   The members, most of them Chinese but some from as far away as
the United States, Australia and Ireland, contended that Sunday's
gathering was neither a political rally nor a revival meeting.
Sitting stoically for hours on folding chairs, the audience of
mostly middle-aged people listened to testimonials from adherents,
who said that practicing Falun Gong had improved their mental and
physical health.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the Chinese government to know we are good people,''
said Liu Feng, a 21-year-old graduate student from the northern
Chinese city of Dalian, who is studying in Ireland. ``The
government has fabricated all these lies about Falun Gong. They
should not treat us that way.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The special millennium bottle of Dom Perignon with the number
2000 stenciled on the back has already been drunk.
</P>
<P>
   The champagne bottle sits mournfully empty on the ledge over the
fireplace in John Koskinen's office, a reminder that when
Washington hurdles into the new year at midnight on Jan. 1, he will
not allow himself even a single festive sip of the bubbly.
</P>
<P>
   ``None for me,'' said Koskinen, who holds the formal title of
chairman of President Clinton's Council on Year 2000 Conversion but
is better known around the White House as Clinton's Y2K czar.
`'I'll be in the middle of all sorts of stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   At 11:59 and 59 seconds on the night of Dec. 31, Koskinen says,
he will be stone sober and seated in a specially built glass-walled
war room in downtown Washington, where a staff of more than 100
will keep watch on the global changeover to a new year, a new
century, a new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be people at different desks gathering information
domestically and from around the world, and there will be a wall of
eight or 10 television screens,'' he said of the so-called
Information Coordination Center, speaking with almost giddy
enthusiasm about the drama that will unfold three weeks from now.
``It'll look like NASA, it'll look like the Defense Department.''
</P>
<P>
   The question for Koskinen is whether the world's major computer
systems can cope with the changeover.
</P>
<P>
   Because older computers were built to record years as only two
digits _ ``99'' for 1999, for example _ the fear is that many
computers will recognize ``00'' as the year 1900 instead of 2000,
creating the potential for disaster if computers controlling
utilities, banks and air-traffic control systems shut themselves
down.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen, the former deputy director for management at the
Office of Management and Budget, has been at work at the White
House since early last year to make sure disaster is avoided.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are clearly going to be glitches,'' he said.
``But we're satisfied that the basic infrastructure in the United
States that people depend upon is going to work. We don't expect
any national failures or regional failures in banking,
telecommunications, oil and gas, transportation.''
</P>
<P>
   The bigger fear, he says, is what will happen overseas, in
developing nations with less sophisticated computer systems and
without the resources to update them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first concern everybody had _ I had, anyway _ was over
what would happen at Russian-designed nuclear plants,'' he said.
``There are 65 of them in Russia and elsewhere, and nobody knew
anything about them two years ago. We've spent a lot of time
focusing on it.'' By working with Russian nuclear and computer
experts, he said, ``I think we're satisfied now that no operating
system will fail for Y2K reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is disaster in the United States or elsewhere, the
coordination center will serve as an information clearinghouse for
the public, with Koskinen providing television briefings on the
federal response.
</P>
<P>
   This is the sort of assignment for which the 60-year-old
Yale-educated lawyer has been preparing all his life. Before
joining the budget office in 1994, Koskinen was known as one of the
nation's premier corporate crisis managers.
</P>
<P>
   A turnaround specialist who was hired to try to restructure
bankrupt companies, he worked for two decades for the Palmieri Co.,
perhaps the nation's best-known turnaround consultants, and helped
untangle the finances of such failed companies as the Penn Central
Railroad. He helped sell some of Penn Central's real estate in the
1970s to an exceptionally brash young businessman named Donald
Trump.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, Donald, don't tell people you're 29, pretend
you're 35, because people don't want to lend $75 million to a
29-year-old,'' Koskinen said.
</P>
<P>
   He admits finding a certain pleasure in turmoil _ or, rather, in
bringing order from it. ``Running things in a maintenance mode is
just not interesting to me,'' he said. ``The reason I liked the
Palmieri Co. is that we were forever taking over disasters, crises,
things that were about to disappear. I've always enjoyed doing
things that looked impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   The grandson of Finnish immigrants on both sides of his family,
Koskinen was raised in Ashland, Ky., where his father worked at
Ashland Oil.
</P>
<P>
   The middle child of three _ his older sister is a retired social
worker, his younger brother an electrical technician _ Koskinen
went to Duke on scholarship and began a lifelong love affair with
the university. He has been chairman of Duke's board of trustees,
and the university's soccer stadium is named for him.
</P>
<P>
   He was a law clerk for David Bazelon, the legendary liberal
jurist who was chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals here, and
then joined the staff of the Kerner Commission, established by
President Lyndon Johnson to study the causes of urban racial
violence. He went on to become administrative aide to Sen. Abraham
Ribicoff, D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen, who normally enjoys the New Year's holiday with his
wife in Hawaii, will not have time even to dream of the tropics
this New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   His day, he says, will begin when he arrives at his office at 6
a.m., when New Zealand becomes the first large nation to cross into
the new year. ``From then on, we'll monitor the world as it goes
into 2000,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At 6:30 that night, Koskinen is scheduled to take a shuttle
flight to New York in a demonstration that the air-traffic control
system is Y2K ready. (The air traffic computer system is tied to
Greenwich Mean Time, which means that it will register midnight at
7 p.m.) He is set to return to Washington on the 8:30 p.m. shuttle,
in plenty of time to monitor the United States as it enters the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   He expects to remain on duty, providing regular televised
briefings, until 4 a.m., ``at which point they will have to wheel
me out.''

</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BEVERLY MEDLYN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are some books that young readers will enjoy:
</P>
<P>
   ``THE HAT: THE HEDGIE GIFT BOX'' &QL; 
Jan Brett &QL; 
(G.P. Putnam's Sons, $16.99) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brett's 1997 charmer about a cute little hedgehog is freshly
packaged into a gift box with a stuffed toy hedgehog just in time
for the Christmas season.
</P>
<P>
   The story centers on Hedgie, who crawls inside a sock that blows
off a clothesline. As the other animals poke fun at him, Hedgie
proudly proclaims that he's wearing a hat to keep warm in the snow.
Not a bad idea, they think. Soon the clothes line is stripped bare.
</P>
<P>
   Brett's colorful, realistic illustrations appeal to young
children. Her trademark border pictures add another layer of
meaning to the tale. For ages 2-5. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``FINGER PUPPET THEATER: THE THREE LITTLE PIGS'' &QL; 
Illustrated by Peter Stevenson (Scholastic, $13.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What a great idea! Finger puppets, board books and fairy tales _
all wrapped up in one package. Scholastic's Finger Puppet Theater
series also includes Hansel and Gretel, Goldilocks and the Little
Red Riding Hood.
</P>
<P>
   Four finger puppet characters come with each story, which
children act out using the sturdy board book pages as a stage.
Lively text and amusing pictures carry the plots.
</P>
<P>
   Young imaginations will soar! For ages 3-7. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``MORRIS'S DISAPPEARING BAG'' &QL; 
Rosemary Wells (Viking, $15.99) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Author of more than 60 children's books, Wells and her beloved
bunny Morris always are a hit. This tale begins on Christmas
morning. Morris' brother Victor gets a hockey outfit. His sister
Rose gets a beauty kit. His sister Betty gets a chemistry set.
Hands off, they say to Morris, who gets a teddy bear.
</P>
<P>
   Then Morris discovers one last gift left under the tree, which
leads to much merriment. The adorable pictures of the bunny family
are funny and captivating. For ages 3-7. &QL;

BIG BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1999 Special for The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was
the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch
of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of
Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it
was the winter of despair . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``THE SIXTIES'' &QL; 
Richard Avedon &QL; 
(Random House/Kodak, $75) &UR;
</P>
<P>
   It's my pleasure to tell you that Richard Avedon's new book,
``The Sixties,'' begins not with a photographic image but with the
opening paragraph of ``A Tale of Two Cities, words written 140
years ago but so remarkably suited to the edgy chaos of the 1960s
that you'll wonder whether Charles Dickens shared some funny
cigarettes with Abbie Hoffman in another life.
</P>
<P>
   Avedon and his collaborator, Doon Arbus, have put together a
book that shows the decade in all its abrasive and contradictory
glory. Notice the juxtaposition of Rose Kennedy and Janis Joplin
(at opposite ends of the book, each wearing her version of finery
and an eerie frown), Truman Capote displaying his belly button and
Andy Warhol his scars, the stiff stare of Henry Kissinger and the
serene gaze of Cesar Chavez. There's the requisite nudity _ female
breasts are outnumbered, for once, by male genitalia _ and every so
often a splash of color that reminds us that psychedelic was a
household word. It will make you squirm, and it will make you laugh
_ a '60s effect indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other big books you might spend your money on this
Christmas season:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``ILLUSTRATED LETTERS: ARTISTS AND WRITERS CORRESPOND'' &QL; 
Edited by Roselyne de Ayala and Jean-Pierre Gueno (Abrams, $60). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is the art of the handwritten letter taken to grand
heights. The editors have gathered more than 60 letters written by
European artists and authors of the 19th and 20th centuries. Some
are just notes with doodles in the margins. Others are illustrated
with exquisite sketches and watercolor scenes. Among the generous
correspondents: Honore de Balzac, Victor Hugo, Guy de Maupassant,
Arthur Rimbaud, Auguste Rodin, Edouard Manet, Vincent van Gogh,
Paul Gaugin, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Pablo Picasso, Max Jacob
and Antoine de Saint-Exupery. With a foreword by Francine Prose. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``FAY'' &QL; 
William Wegman (Hyperion, $26.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you've grown tired of Wegman's ubiquitous Weimaraners, this
book might pull you back into the fold. The text that accompanies
Wegman's photos of his beloved Fay Ray and her offspring, Battina
(who stayed on after Fay's other puppies went off to new homes),
reminds us that these were DOGS, that in addition to their work
with Wegman _ Fay, especially, knew how to hold a pose _ they
chased balls, hurled themselves into swimming pools, played in the
mud, mated, gave birth and changed their owner's life in ways not
just professional. If there's a dog lover on your Christmas list,
look here. &QL; 
 &QL; 
WOMEN &QL; 
Annie Leibovitz, with an essay by Susan Sontag (Random House,
$75). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Portraits of women, celebrated and obscure. It begins with a
photograph of Leibovitz's mother, then moves on to farmers, maids,
astronauts, soldiers, battered wives, Supreme Court judges,
showgirls and bull riders. More familiar faces are those of
Elizabeth Taylor, architect Maya Lin, writers Eudora Welty and
Jamaica Kincaid, Yoko Ono, Susan Sarandon, Joni Mitchell, Serena
and Venus Williams, Hillary Clinton and Madeleine Albright. It's
worth the price of admission just to see the kind gaze of the late
Osceola McCarty, who worked for 75 years as a Mississippi
washerwoman, then donated $150,000 that she'd saved over her
lifetime to establish a college scholarship for African-American
students in need. &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE ART OF THE MARKET &QL; 
Bob Tamarkin and Les Krantz (ST&AMP;C, $35). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An illustrated history of American business as seen through its
stock certificates. The paper certificates that were proof of
ownership before the days of electronic trading are becoming
financial artifacts with a value of their own. From a terrier named
Prince, who appeared on certificates issued by Farmers Deposit
National Bank in Pittsburgh in the early 1900s (Prince's owner was
the bank president), to the nude woman on certificates for Playboy
Enterprises, Tamarkin and Krantz show how whimsical a marriage of
art and commerce can be. &QL; 
``AND THE CROWD GOES WILD'' &QL; 
Joe Garner (Sourcebooks, $49.95). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The big draw is not the book, which is nothing extraordinary,
but two CDs that offer broadcasts of some of the most memorable
moments in sports. Included are Lou Gehrig saying goodbye to
baseball; Bill Mazeroski's home run in the 1960 World Series; the
Green Bay Packers' win over Dallas in December 1967; Bob Beamon's
long jump in the 1968 Olympics; Secretariat's triumph in the Triple
Crown; the Borg-McEnroe match at Wimbledon in 1980; Tiger Woods'
triumph at the 1997 Masters; Michael Jordan's sixth NBA
championship; and the U.S. women's win in soccer's 1999 World Cup.
With a foreword by Hank Aaron, an afterword by Wayne Gretzky, and
narration by Bob Costas. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``SNAKE'' &QL; 
Chris Mattison (DK, $29.95). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Big, bold pictures of creatures you don't want to find under
your Christmas tree. There are more than 60 individual species from
all over the world in Mattison's ``gallery,'' with information
about environment, anatomy, reproduction, and hunting and feeding.
A starter for would-be herpetologists. &QL; 
``NORMAN ROCKWELL: PICTURES FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE''  &QL; 
(Abrams, $35). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you love the paintings of Norman Rockwell, you can come out
of the closet now. Critics and art historians who previously looked
down their noses at Rockwell are now celebrating his influence on
the American psyche. This book, published in conjunction with the
traveling exhibition of the same name, includes 80 of Rockwell's
paintings, as well as essays not only by curators and historians
but by Robert Coles and Rockwell's son, Peter. The paintings are
anecdotal and as familiar as your own memories. The essays at times
seem like a collective  &UR; mea culpa offered to a man long regarded as
a mere illustrator, and to the people who have admired him for
decades. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``AFRICAN CEREMONIES'' &QL; 
Carol Beckwith and Angela Fisher &UR; Abrams, $150) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This slip-cased, two-volume set weighs 16 pounds, covers 26
countries and contains descriptions and photographs of more than 40
ceremonies, some of which will make you flinch just to think about
them. Spectacularly illustrated, it's the cornerstone of the
authors' effort to document vanishing tribal customs in Africa. &QL; 
``NEW YORK: AN ILLUSTRATED HISTORY'' &QL; 
Ric Burns and James Sanders &UR; (Knopf, $60). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a good deal of strolling on the thin edge of
nothingness. A splattering of fiery particles cascades down from
the torches that the steel workers use for cutting 10-ton girders
in half and for lighting their cigarettes.'' That's how the ``New
York Times'' described the spectacular bravado of the men who built
the Empire State Building in 1930, one of the best stories in this
elegant companion volume to the public television documentary
written and directed by Burns. &QL; 
``EARLY DYLAN'' &QL; 
Photographs by Barry Feinstein, Daniel Kramer and Jim Marshall
(Bulfinch, $35). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It could break your heart, he looks so young and happy. So do
Joan Baez and Mary Travers and even Johnny Cash. They stay that way
within the confines of this slim book, unlike the aging Dylan we
see in Richard Avedon's ``The Sixties.'' This collection of
photographs is a slice of '60s life that skirts the flamboyance and
focuses on a handful of people, their friendships and their music.
With a short foreword by Arlo Guthrie. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``YACHTING'S GOLDEN AGE'' &QL; 
Ed Holm (Knopf, $65) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here are more than 100 glass-plate images documenting yachting's
glory days, from 1880 to 1905. You don't have to know much about
sailing to see that these boats were extraordinary, each a
one-of-a-kind, handcrafted vessel with a unique personality. When
seen from across an expanse of water, they looked, Holm writes,
like ``a flight of giant migrating butterflies,'' their sails
swollen all out of proportion to the tiny crafts below. These
images were made by a handful of pioneering maritime photographers,
who used techniques developed in the years after the Civil War.

ELECTION IN CHILE SEEN AS MEASURE OF SOCIAL CHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile _ A former aide to the late Socialist president,
Salvador Allende Gossens, faced a former official in Gen. Augusto
Pinochet's dictatorship in Chile's presidential elections on
Sunday. The vote capped a yearlong campaign that has been
surprisingly free of tension or ideology, with both candidates
concentrating on practical solutions to everyday problems involving
crime, health care and unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls have forecast that neither the Socialist-Christian
Democratic candidate, Ricardo Lagos, nor his main conservative
challenger, Joaquin Lavin, will be able to tally the outright
majority required to avert a runoff election next month, since the
four minor-party candidates together are expected to win more than
5 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   With 50 percent of the vote counted, Lagos led Lavine by 48.08
percent to 47.52 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was seen as a first test of whether an estimated 8
million Chilean voters are ready to rally behind the first serious
presidential contender who is a member of the Socialist Party since
Allende died in a 1973 coup, or elect a right-wing candidate as
president for the first time since Pinochet stepped down in 1990.
Christian Democratic presidents, in coalition with Socialists, have
led Chile since then.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates downplayed the early years of their careers in
more polarized times, and they ran on similar platforms in order to
attract moderate voters. Both promised to make job growth their No.
1 concern, expand public health care in rural areas and overhaul
the nation's police to stem rising crime.
</P>
<P>
   They even agreed on the most sensitive issue in Chilean politics
today: a Spanish judge's efforts to extradite Pinochet from
Britain, where he remains under house-arrest on allegations of
torture. Both candidates said they would continue the current
government's policy of contesting the extradition so that Pinochet
might face justice in the Chilean courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both candidates are exorcising the demons of the past,'' said
Lucia Santa Cruz, a historian. ``If Lavin wins, we will have an
alternation of government, which is an essential ingredient of
democracy. And if Lagos wins we will have a Socialist president who
hopefully will prove that Socialists can govern with political and
economic stability.''
</P>
<P>
   But other analysts were critical that neither candidate made
much of an effort to address several issues tied to the past, like
whether to start investigations of torture under the military
regime or to rewrite a constitution, prepared while Pinochet still
ruled, that gives the military several appointed senators and
independent powers over its budget and command structure.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos' slogan, ``Growth With Equality,'' and Lavin's slogan,
``Long Live Change,'' sound as if they belong to the same campaign.
But for all their similar proposals and caution, the 61-year-old
Lagos and the 46-year-old Lavin have offered the voters a contrast
in resumes and campaign styles.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer and economist, Lagos was Allende's candidate to become
ambassador to the Soviet Union at the time of the Pinochet coup.
But Lagos has preferred to emphasize his service as minister of
education and minister of public works in the two governments led
by Christian Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   He has promised to fill his Cabinet with many Christian
Democrats, who continue to form the largest party in Lagos'
coalition, in an effort to retain the support of more conservative
Christian Democrats who express fear that a Socialist president
could upset the country's stability.
</P>
<P>
   An engineer who studied economics at the University of Chicago,
Lavin worked in Pinochet's Planning Ministry. But he has preferred
to publicize his programs to control traffic congestion, control
gang activity and create charter schools in his seven years as
mayor of the Santiago community of Las Condes.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to stir an increasingly apolitical youth vote, Lavin has
run a tightly scripted, populist campaign that warms up crowds with
rap music, dueling drummers and clowns on stilts. He frequently
shuns hotels while touring the country, preferring to stay in
peoples' homes _ favoring recent victims of crime to emphasize his
interest in the issue.
</P>
<P>
   His most effective applause line is a promise that he will end
the policy of the last two Christian Democratic presidents of
blocking executions of convicted murderers, but otherwise he has
positioned himself as a liberal reformer.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At a campaign rally in Santiago last week, Lavin said his dream
was to see that the child of a poor Mapuche Indian standing on the
platform with him would have the same educational opportunities as
his seven children have had. ``I don't believe in a country that
pits the rich against the poor,'' he said, ``nor a country that
pits civilians against military officers nor a country that pits
businessmen against workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Lagos has run a more traditional and, until the last few weeks,
a rather lackluster campaign that has exhibited difficulty in
parrying Lavin's liberal-sounding campaign without going too far to
the left itself.
</P>
<P>
   But Lagos' Christian Democratic-Socialist coalition appeared to
make an effective maneuver earlier this month when it brought a new
labor law to the floor of the Senate that would have given
collective bargaining rights to an additional 2.5 million workers.
When senators belonging to the two conservative parties backing
Lavin blocked the legislation, Lagos mocked Lavin's contention that
he is an agent of change who would uplift the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday the right took their covering off and showed whose
interests they really represent,'' Lagos said triumphantly at a
rally a week ago in the port of Valparaiso. ``The same right that
opposes the workers and who supported the dictatorship now are the
ones who call for change.'' He later added, ``When we speak of
equality it's not just a slogan, it's a principle we have fought
for all our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Just how far Chile has come in recent years could be seen Sunday
at the National Stadium, where the military gathered thousands of
leftists during the 1973 coup for torture, execution or forced
exile. On Sunday, conservatives, Socialists and even Communists
formed long, neat lines to vote _ without incident _ as military
police in fatigues looked on under a blazing sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our dreams of 30 years ago have had to change,'' said Nelson
Miranda, 44, an art teacher who said he voted for Lagos. ``Today we
Socialists are talking about taking the best from capitalism but
then better redistributing the wealth.''
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Santana, 22, a marketing assistant at a public relations
firm, said he voted for Lavin because ``we need fewer words and
more action, change, new ideas and younger people in government.''

   LANDOVER, Md. _ Arizona quarterback Jake Plummer had one of
those afternoons that make a head coach want to pull out his hair.
There were moments when Plummer was dazzling, running as if his
feet were on fire, throwing deep with that bionic arm. But those
moments were only a few.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time Plummer looked confused, throwing the ball into
double coverage or one-hopping passes off the grass. For a defense
that has been as popular around these parts as team owner Daniel
Snyder at a former Redskin employees' convention, Plummer picked a
particularly embarrassing time for his funk.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins were happy to oblige Plummer, intercepting him
three times. Washington's 30th-ranked defense was the main reason
the Redskins captured perhaps their biggest game of the season,
28-3, before 75,851 at Fed Ex Field.
</P>
<P>
   If Washington had lost, Snyder might have started poring over
his Rolodex, stopping at `C' for Dom Capers, the defensive
coordinator of the Jacksonville Jaguars and `S' for Schottenheimer,
the former Kansas City Chiefs coach, as possible replacements for
Coach Norv Turner, who is fighting for his job. The game was
crucial because Dallas beat Philadelphia, and the Redskins needed a
victory to stay ahead of the Cowboys and the Giants. A Washington
loss could have led to playoff extinction, and at the end of the
season Turner would have gone the way of the dodo bird.
</P>
<P>
   Now the National Football Conference East is realistically a
three-team race among Washington (8-5) and Dallas (7-6) and the
Giants (7-6). The Cowboys have the easiest schedule, with home
games against the Jets and Giants and a road game against sorry New
Orleans. The Redskins finish at Indianapolis and San Francisco and
then home against Miami, a game both teams might need to make the
playoffs. The Giants, in addition to the Cowboys game, play at St.
Louis and at home against Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you play like we did today, you feel pretty good about
yourself,'' Turner said. ``Hopefully this win can carry us a long
way.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't all Washington's defense. The Redskins had 406 total
yards of offense. They were well balanced, with Stephen Davis
rushing for a career-high 189 yards on 37 attempts and Brad Johnson
throwing for two touchdowns and keying the Redskins' juicy 63
percent completion rate on third down.
</P>
<P>
   But the Redskins' defense, which all season has been picked
apart by opposing teams and ridiculed by the news media, finally
did well. Washington forced five Arizona turnovers, including a
crucial Adrian Murrell fumble late in the first half with
Washington ahead 14-6. The Cardinals did not have a first down in
the second half until near the two-minute warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to watch film and not be proud of some of the
things we did,'' Arizona wide receiver Frank Sanders said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the Washington defense played so well was because of
a series of extraordinary meetings. Players on defense have been
privately complaining about the play calling by some of the
defensive coaches. This week Snyder stepped in to stop a potential
disaster. He met individually with team leaders Marco Coleman, Dana
Stubblefield, Tre Johnson and Irving Fryar, asking them to spread
the word to players that no one should worry about play calling and
instead just do what the coaches ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players need to be accountable to themselves, instead of
blaming things on the coaches _ that was the message,'' Fryar said.
</P>
<P>
   Then a small group of veterans called a players-only meeting on
Saturday, in which the message was that the team needed to become
more unified.
</P>
<P>
   Everything worked. After Davis ran for a spectacular 50-yard
touchdown, the Cardinals countered with a Chris Jacke 31-yard field
goal. That was all the sparing there would be.
</P>
<P>
   Washington scored on a Fryar 7-yard touchdown catch, a Michael
Westbrook 25-yard touchdown catch and an 11-yard Skip Hicks run.
The defense, meanwhile, strangled Plummer. They watched game film
of Plummer's final-second heroics last week against Philadelphia
and noticed that when he got outside the pocket, he was especially
dangerous. So they concentrated all week on containing the mobile
quarterback, and the extra effort paid off as he completed only 15
of 32 passes for 147 yards. He was also sacked five times.
</P>
<P>
   In the first nine contests, the Redskins gave up 27 points a
game but only 16 a game in the last four. The 3 points allowed
against Arizona are a season low.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to stand in there and deliver the ball, and I wasn't
doing that,'' Plummer said.

BRADLEY RETURNS TO CAMPAIGN TRAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
By ILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ With all eyes watching his return to the
campaign trail, Bill Bradley on Sunday made a spirited run at Vice
President Al Gore for questioning his commitment to health and
retirement benefits for the elderly and the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there one person in this room who questions our belief in
Social Security or Medicare or civil rights?'' Bradley asked the
thousands gathered here for the state Democratic party convention.
``I don't think so. That's why I find it so dismaying that one
Democrat can attack another on these issues that are articles of
faith of our party.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days after being taken to the hospital with an irregular
heartbeat, Bradley's voice was strong and his mood seemed high as
he energetically laid out his agenda and vision for the presidency.
Aides said he would continue to maintain a full pace on the
campaign trail, including two days in New Hampshire at the end of
the week.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley never mentioned Gore's name during his rebuke, and
later, he refused to characterize the vice president's attacks on
his proposals. ``The words speak for themselves,'' he said, before
heading to a fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   But Steve Pajcic, who is leading Bradley's Florida effort, was
blunt as he answered the question on behalf of the candidate,
calling Gore's statements ``nasty political exaggerations and
overstatement.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Gore and his allies have flayed Bradley daily
for his health care proposal, which would replace Medicaid with
subsidies for private insurance. The vice president contends that
the plan would destroy Medicaid, undrmine Medicare, and harm
African-Americans, Latinos, the disabled, and the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Until Sunday, Bradley has had little to say about the criticism
and his campaign staff has struggled internally over how best to
respond. An attempt at humor last week that accused Gore of
``uncontrollable lying,'' was quickly renounced by the New Jersey
headquarters and blamed on the New Hampshire staff.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates will meet Friday evening in Nashua for a
town-hall style meeting to be televised on ABC's ``Nightline.'' It
will be the Democratic candidates' second get-together in an
increasingly heated campaign. t the convention Sunday, the former
New Jersey senator attempted to set his record straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I served 18 years on the Senate Finance Committee and worked
to protect Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security,'' Bradley
told the party faithful here. ``And frankly, I don't remember
Democrats attacking Democrats on this issue _ at least not in the
party I joined and the party I'm a member of today.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Gore campaign was unremorseful Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a Republican had proposed eliminating Medicaid and
replacing it with a voucher system that was insufficient to cover
the poor, the disabled, the elderly, and those who are HIV
positive, every Democrat in the country would be up in arms,'' said
Chris Lehane, Gore's spokesman. ``Instead of defending his plan on
the merits and the substance, he just cries foul.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley had his own barbs for Gore, which he also delivered
without naming his opponent for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the greatest country in the world at the moment of our
reatest prosperity, and yet there are some people who say we cannot
do big things anymore _ that wemust just tinker around the edges
and approve a few little things here and there,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I say, now is not the time to settle,'' he said, in a
refrain he used repeatedly while calling for affordable health care
for all, registering and licensing all handgun owners, bringing all
children out of poverty, publicly financing elections, maintaining
affirmative action, and demanding the best public schools in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know something? I don't think you're willing to settle,''
said Bradley, his voice rising. ``Democratic leaders do not
settle!''
</P>
<P>
   Though Bradley was well received here, this was a crowd that
belonged more to Gore than to his challenger. The delegates have
strong ties to organized labor and the teachers' union and have
been stroked for years by President Clinton and Gore, both of whom
spoke on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Few people attending the convention expressed any serious
concern about Bradley's heart condition, which is called atrial
fibrillation and results in an occasional irregular heartbeat.
Bradley said he forgot to take his medication, sparking last
Friday's episode, and his heart corrected itself before he even
arrived at the hospital in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a strong, athletic person,'' said Ed Kopf, a Palm Beach
biology teacher who was wearing a Gore button. ``He has been his
whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   John Bell, a retired mental health counselor who grew up in
Missouri, shrugged off any question about Bradley's health: ``He
seemed OK to me.''

FORBES CAMPAIGN IS MAKING IOWA ITS TOP PRIORITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ In a convention hall filled with farm
families from every corner of Iowa, Steve Forbes recently came face
to face with George W. Bush and was treated to a vision of his
coming task in Iowa's caucuses next month.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever Bush went, cameras and flashes heralded his way, and
teen-age girls squealed with delight to be near him. A sea of John
Deere-green baseball hats labeled ``Bush Farm Team'' bobbed on
farmers' heads as they surged forward for autographs and a closer
look at Bush, the governor of Texas and the front-runner in the
race for the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In another corner at the Farm Bureau's annual meeting was
Forbes, the multimillionaire magazine publisher, with only a meager
crowd around him as he earnestly extolled the money-saving virtues
of his flat tax plan.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, when Kara Holtkamp of West Point, put one of the
Bush hats in Forbes' hands for an autograph, he gamely quipped:
``Bush will let you wear the green. I'll let you keep the green.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Bush's long shadow falls over the Forbes campaign
here, it is in Iowa, Forbes campaign strategists say, that they
feel they have the best chance of halting Bush's march toward his
party's nomination, and establishing Forbes as a viable
alternative.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the Forbes campaign is making Iowa its top
priority. Veteran political strategists, with years of experience
in local politics, are on Forbes' payroll. Television
advertisements that cost about $60,000 a week are filling the Iowa
airwaves. Grass-roots organizations have been set up in every
county and most of the state's precincts, complete with county farm
chairmen, anti-abortion captains and an assortment of other
volunteer leaders to round up Forbes supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Sophisticated direct mail and phone bank campaigns are under
way, stressing how Forbes' tax program will help farmers. And the
candidate himself has been hopping from one crossroads town to
another in a campaign bus that blares John Philip Sousa marches,
and wooing local voters by offering first-class food and drink.
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes campaign here sees itself as part of a one-two punch
to halt the front-runner: Forbes solidly challenging Bush in Iowa
and Sen. John McCain of Arizona closing in on Bush in New
Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primaries, to be held on Feb. 1,
one week after the Iowa caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   While no one _ even those in the Forbes camp _ expects Forbes to
win in Iowa, they are hoping to keep Bush's lead here as slim as
possible. McCain has avoided Iowa and is concentrating on New
Hampshire, where he and Bush are neck and neck in the polls and
Forbes remains a distant third.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain is banking on us in Iowa to hold Bush down,'' said
William Dal Col, the Forbes campaign manager. ``And we're banking
on him in New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   John Maxwell, the campaign's top pollster, said: ``Our Iowa
strategy is to show Forbes as a viable candidate and pierce the
veneer of inevitability of Bush. No one has ever gotten the
Republican nomination doing poorly both in Iowa and New Hampshire.
We're posing a serious threat to Bush in Iowa and McCain is in New
Hampshire. Bush cannot take a double hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes strategists are banking that their candidate's
conservative economic message _ reducing taxes and shrinking the
government _ will resonate with Iowa Republicans. But they are also
hoping to score big with a socially conservative message of family
values and opposition to abortion, much as Pat Robertson, the
religious broadcaster, did when he placed second in the caucuses in
1988, behind then-Sen. Bob Dole of neighboring Kansas, and as Pat
Buchanan did when he finished a strong second in 1996, behind Dole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forbes is trying to emerge as a religious conservative
alternative to Bush,'' said Dennis Goldford, head of the department
of politics at Drake University. ``In the Republican caucuses,
something like 40 percent of the voters can be social
conservatives, and Forbes has decided to bend that way. He has no
illusion he could beat Bush. But if he could soften him in Iowa and
McCain can deliver a punch, then people might start looking for
someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   To this end, the Forbes campaign has put the former head of the
Iowa Christian Coalition, Stephen Scheffler, on its Iowa payroll,
and Scheffler has lined up an array of Iowa anti-abortion leaders
who are telling social conservatives that Forbes is a more viable
candidate than Gary Bauer, who is also seeking votes from religious
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Audiotapes of Forbes' anti-abortion speech at the National
Christian Coalition convention are being sent to social
conservatives, along with a number of position papers and a
brochure called the ``Baby Mailer'' by local staff members because
of the photograph on the cover of this anti-abortion pamphlet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm convinced Forbes is a guy who can go the long haul, has a
message that is consistent and he's a winnable candidate,'' said
Scheffler. ``Social conservatives are convinced that he is for real
and won't get squishy with his pro-family agenda when he gets
elected.''
</P>
<P>
   In spending, organization and advertising, Forbes is going toe
to toe with Bush, just as he did in last August's Iowa straw poll,
when Forbes and Bush spent from $800,000 to $1 million each. Bush
came in first, with 31 percent of the nonbinding vote, and Forbes
finished second with 20 percent. The Forbes campaign would not say
how much Forbes, who is dipping into his $440 million fortune to
pay for his candidacy, has budgeted for the Iowa caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in a typical election that is settled at the ballot box,
victory in the Iowa caucuses often goes to the candidate with the
superior organization _ one that can deliver supporters to 2,142
local precincts for several hours of political debate with their
neighbors on a cold night in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to go out and get real people,'' said Dal Col, the
Forbes campaign manager. ``You've got to grab them and get them to
go out on a night that can be 20 to 30 degrees below zero, have
them fight for their candidates and then take a vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Grubbs, a Forbes campaign employee and former chairman of
the Iowa Republican Party, added, ``It's not like you have one big
battle; you have 2,000 little ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually, about 100,000 Republicans _ roughly 20 percent of the
total in the state _ show up at the caucuses. In a multicandidate
field like the current one, the candidate who can get about 40,000
of those can win. In 1996, Dole won with 33,000 votes against
Buchanan, Lamar Alexander, the former governor of Tennessee, and
Forbes. Not only are the number of votes needed to win relatively
small, but victory is entirely symbolic _ they are not binding on
any Iowa delegate to the Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   How Forbes is approaching his campaign in Iowa is markedly
different from his 1996 campaign, when he came in at the last
minute with a series of negative television advertisements
attacking Dole and had virtually no ground organization; Forbes
ended up placing fourth. In addition, his reputation here was
tarnished by the viciousness of his attacks on Dole, which only
succeeded in damaging Dole's image nationally and labeling Forbes
as a spoiler in his own party.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Forbes campaign here says, it has learned from
those mistakes. ``In 1996 we threw some ads up on the air, but we
didn't have a ground game,'' Grubbs said. ``This time we have a
ground organization second to none to compete with Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' broadcasting campaign consists of three television
advertisements promoting his own views and making subtle digs at
Bush, who has been criticized for his inexperience, especially in
foreign affairs. One commercial shows Forbes with Ronald Reagan,
highlights the candidate's ``three decades of experience'' and
``vast knowledge'' as publisher of the ``foremost business magazine
in the world,'' and maintains that Forbes' tenure at Radio Free
Europe ``helped play a role in the fall of Communism.''
</P>
<P>
   But will this all work? Iowa's five-term former Republican
governor, Terry Branstad, who is a Bush supporter, said that while
he believed that Bush had ``a broader base and wider public
support,'' Forbes was doing ``much better'' than in 1996: ``He's
got his bus tours, he's got his money, he's hired people who know
how to run an organization and he's spending the time here.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is clear that Forbes has his work cut out for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forbes seems mean-spirited,'' said Joshua Bronsink, a Des
Moines business consultant who attended a recent Chamber of
Commerce luncheon here where Bush talked about his tax plan. ``And
I'm against a lot of what he says socially. Forbes is not
electable, although I do think he will do well in Iowa. But, for
me, he's always tearing people down and he's never been elected to
anything before. That's why I'm for Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar concerns were expressed at the Farm Bureau meeting.
``I'm afraid people are tired of Forbes from last time around,''
said Don Wolhford, a Franklin County farmer. ``People don't think
he's electable, and they see Bush as a fresh face.''

FAR-OUT ARTISTRY OVERSHADOWS TECHNIQUE AT PRO CHAMPIONSHIPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the Metabolife World Professional Figure
Skating Championships ended Saturday night at the MCI Center, Tara
Lipinski and Aleksei Urmanov had won the singles titles.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-year-old Lipinski, the American who won the women's gold
medal in the 1998 Olympics, skated a slow, dreamy program in which
her artistry overshadowed her technical achievements.
</P>
<P>
   Urmanov, the 1994 Olympic men's champion from Russia, mixed near
flawless skating with show-biz hype. He wore thigh-high boots, an
outrageous Russian-style jacket and a 16-foot cape and did
illusionist acts while skating. He seemingly turned a baton into a
kerchief and back again. He plucked a bouquet of flowers from
nowhere. He also did three triple jumps and a double axel.
</P>
<P>
   Urmanov was not alone in far-out costumes. Brian Boitano wore a
psychedelic shirt, bell-bottom trousers and little yellow glasses.
Ilya Kulik did a routine with a baseball cap. Even the women
combined untraditional programs with untraditional dress, notably
Tonia Kwiatkowski's Marilyn Monroe takeoff, complete with blond wig
and swinging hips.
</P>
<P>
   Such diversions are seldom seen in traditional competition for
amateurs, or, more accurately, for skaters eligible for the
Olympics. Which leads to some questions: Is professional figure
skating a real sport, entertainment, or both? And if it is a sport,
is it the same sport as amateur skating?
</P>
<P>
   The questions were put Sunday to Dick Button, a 1948 and 1952
Olympic champion, who is admittedly biased. While Button's candid
analysis for ABC has helped popularize the amateur sport, he is
also the founder, owner and major domo of the pro championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Professional skating is quite different,'' he said, ``maybe
not a different sport, but a different aesthetic, a different
agenda. We recognize there are two different aspects of skating:
aesthetics and artistry. Professional skating has some of both.''
</P>
<P>
   Button added: ``In the amateur world, they count your triple
jumps, and if you don't do enough they forget about your other
skating. We do not make our competitors prove their merit. We let
them present creative programs with as many or as few triple jumps
as they wish. And we take only the best skaters in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Or at least the best available. The best female skater in the
world is probably Michelle Kwan, the American who won this title
last year when the International Skating Union, the world governing
body for amateur figure and speed skating, allowed amateurs to
compete. She could not compete here this year because she is
technically an amateur, albeit an amateur who earns an annual
seven-figure income from skating.
</P>
<P>
   If Kwan and other amateurs were judged here under amateur rules,
they would probably dominate. Boitano, who has won this title six
times, boycotted last year because he thought it would be unfair
for him to have to compete against amateurs doing essentially
technical rather than show programs.
</P>
<P>
   The public seems to like pro skating's mix of athleticism and
entertainment. Ice-show tours bring $1 million or more to such
stars as Lipinski, Kristi Yamaguchi and Scott Hamilton.
Competitions such as the pro championships give pro skating
visibility because television thrives on figure skating and its
high ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Although pros receive scores from judges, they essentially skate
for the crowds. The pros like their version of the sport and insist
they are still athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel that much different,'' Lipinski said. ``I still
train every day. I take only one week of vacation a year. When I
compete, I'm not as nervous as I was in the Olympics, but I'm still
nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Boitano put it best when he said: ``The job of amateurs
is to jump. Our job is to jump and entertain.''

   WASHINGTON _ ``Yours,'' Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah admonished Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas during the first of the Republican
presidential debates earlier this month, ``is not user friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   As political zingers go, it might have been a bit lame. But that
Hatch would use precious air time to criticize an opponent's Web
site as ``pretty tough to use'' is only one indication of how the
presidential candidates are confronting the Internet and technology
generally, both as substantive issues and as pervasive cultural
forces.
</P>
<P>
   They are raising money over the Internet. They are raising money
from people who have grown rich from the Internet. They are
debating how best to nurture the potential of the Internet while
shielding children from pornography and consumers from potential
misuse of data about them. And in the early stages of the first
Internet-era national election, they are eager to let voters know
they are as comfortable with a mouse as the next guy is.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pace of candidate education is nearly as rapid as the pace
of technological development,'' said Rep. Christopher Cox,
R-Calif., who is one of the few true techies in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore long ago dropped his paternity claim to
the Internet. But Gore, who can sometimes be spotted with a Palm
Pilot clipped to his belt, dropped into the CyberStop Cafe in
Washington last week and with reporters and photographers watching
sent an e-mail message to Bill Bradley, his rival for the
Democratic presidential nomination, questioning his opponent's
stand on Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has held electronic town-hall meetings. And the
Republican candidates have gone back and forth about technology
issues regularly during their debates.
</P>
<P>
   ``In not very many years, politics has moved from a lot of
smoke-filled rooms and ward bosses giving out turkeys to
constituents to dueling e-mails,'' said Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, a
Democrat with a strong interest in technology issues. ``This is an
extraordinary transformation in politics. To reach the swing,
independent voters who are going to decide about the 2000
elections, you've got to talk about these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The most politically charged of the issues may be whether and
how to apply sales taxes to electronic commerce, and it is shaping
up as a test of the candidates' views on the Internet in the
economy and society.
</P>
<P>
   Most governors and many local government officials are worried
that as business migrates from Main Street and the mall to
Amazon.com and eBay, state governments will face a fiscal crisis,
since online retailers for the most part are not required to
collect sales taxes, the primary revenue source for states.
</P>
<P>
   But in Washington, there is support in both parties for making
the Internet a permanently tax-free shopping zone. A government
commission studying the matter seems headed toward a deadlock.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is particularly tricky for Bush, who is trying to
establish his anti-tax credentials but shares the concerns of other
governors that revenue losses from a shift to tax-free Internet
shopping could leave states in a bind and hurt traditional
retailers. Bush favors extending a moratorium against Internet
taxes while the issue gets further study.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's unwillingness to come out definitively against Internet
sales taxes is being exploited by his rivals, who are suggesting
obliquely that Bush is soft on taxes and may be a bit of a Luddite
to boot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet should not be taxed,'' Sen. John McCain of
Arizona said. He extolled the Internet as ``the greatest thing
that's happened to the world,'' and compared its impact to a
combination of the printing press and the industrial revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governors are incredibly short-sighted when they want to
tax this baby in its cradle,'' McCain said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hatch said it was ``far overblown to think that the fact that
people buy over the Internet is going to reduce Main Street USA.''
</P>
<P>
   But the politics of technology can be complicated. Despite his
message to Washington to ``keep the government's mitts off'' the
industry, Hatch has been a supporter of the federal antitrust case
against Microsoft Corp. He has been raising campaign funds from
executives at some of Microsoft's rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, by contrast, says the Microsoft case is a waste of
time and money, because the pace of change in the software business
will render moot any court judgment.
</P>
<P>
   The scramble to raise money from technology companies almost
guarantees that candidates will continue to pay attention to the
issues on the industry's mind.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had raised $1.73 million from people affiliated with
technology and communications companies through Oct. 15, while Gore
had raised $1.54 million from them, Bradley had raised $770,000,
and McCain $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   But the candidates seem fascinated and intrigued by the
technology's potential to affect the world, not just dot-com
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Defending his support for bringing China into the World Trade
Organization, Bush cited the Web's potential to communicate
democratic values even in the face of opposition from a repressive
regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine if the Internet took hold in China,'' Bush said.
``Imagine how freedom would spread.''

 By JODY GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
IRVING _ The playoff picture didn't get much clearer Sunday, but at
least Dallas stayed in it.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Needing a win to stay close in the NFC East, the Cowboys had
little trouble defeating the hapless Philadelphia Eagles 20-10 to
stay one game behind Washington in the race for the division crown.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants (7-6), who defeated Buffalo, remain tied with Dallas
(7-6) for second place. The Redskins (8-5) knocked off Arizona
(6-7) to dim the Cardinals' hopes of a repeat trip to the
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   There was no celebrating in the Cowboys' locker room, just a
sense of guarded optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have to win the next three,'' Dallas safety Darren
Woodson said. ``We have to come back out next week and play well,
and then the next two after that. It's four wins, or we stay home.
That's the way we're looking at it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a victory on both sides of the ball, with the Cowboys'
offense scoring a pair of touchdowns for the first time since
hosting Green Bay last month. In the three games since, the offense
had been nearly nonexistent, scoring only one touchdown during an
11-quarter period.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas defense, which has played well most of the season,
held its opponent to less than 14 points for the fifth straight
time and the ninth in 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they understood our mission,'' Dallas coach Chan
Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   The cost, however, was as high as the net gain Sunday. Before
the first quarter had ended, the Cowboys had lost running back
Emmitt Smith to a strained left groin, defensive end Greg Ellis to
a fractured left tibia, and cornerback Kevin Mathis to a strained
left knee. Center Mark Stepnoski later left after aggravating his
left calf strain.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis' injury ended his season, and the second-year player
underwent surgery after the game. The other players will be
re-evaluated today.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you start feeling snakebit, you start feeling sorry for
yourself, and that doesn't do anyone any good,'' Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys made some changes on offense Sunday, putting Deion
Sanders into the game plan and signing Eddie Murray off the Detroit
Lions' broadcast team to replace fired kicker Richie Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   Both contributed, but neither was the hero.
</P>
<P>
   The heroes were the guys who generally spend more time on the
bench than on the field but who had healthy bodies and were pressed
into duty. Chris Warren, running for the injured Smith, carried 25
times for 92 yards. He skirted four yards untouched into the end
zone in the first quarter to score Dallas' initial touchdown,
giving the Cowboys a 7-3 lead with 4:49 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   First-year receiver Jason Tucker finished the day with three
catches for 37 yards. Chris Brazzell, recently elevated from the
practice squad, caught a big pass for 12 yards. And tight ends
David LaFleur and Eric Bjornson combined for six catches for 69
yards. LaFleur was on the receiving end of a an eight-yard
touchdown pass in the third period that put Dallas on top 20-3.
</P>
<P>
   Eight Cowboys caught passes as quarterback Troy Aikman completed
22 of 40 attempts, including several long gainers. He hit Rocket
Ismail with a 26-yarder, LaFleur with a 25-yarder, Warren with a
24-yarder and Tucker with a 19-yarder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like the guys we are playing with because they are
doing what they can to help us,'' Aikman said. ``I have confidence
in these guys, but I need more playing time with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders caught a pair of passes for 14 yards, one to convert a
third down. But his largest contribution won't show up in the
statistics. When Sanders was on offense, the Eagles were forced to
commit two defenders to his side, opening things up for leading
receiver Ismail (four catches for 52 yards) and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he even steps on the field, they have to account for where
he's at,'' LaFleur said.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders expects to see more time on offense in upcoming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to incorporate me more and more,'' he said.
``They didn't want to overload me to make sure I didn't blow my
hamstring and groin out.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray proved a so-so substitute for Cunningham, connecting on
field goals of 30 and 34 yards in the second quarter. He missed two
other attempts _ a 49-yard try to cap the Cowboys' first drive
bounced off the right upright, and a 33-yard try early in the
fourth quarter went wide right.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just like anybody else. He needs to get out there and
play,'' Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys moved the ball much better than in recent weeks,
amassing 337 total yards, the most since the Nov. 14 Green Bay
game, when they had 339. Aikman, who has failed to throw for 200
yards in six of his 10 starts, threw for 242, the most since he
amassed 244 against Washington in the sixth game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're improved,'' Gailey said, ``but we're not where we need
to be.''
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to get too excited over the offensive improvement,
considering it came against a 3-10 team with the 23rd-worst defense
in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to know how much the team progresses from one
week to the next,'' Aikman said. ``I don't know if we did. I don't
know if we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense has clearly gotten better each week, and on Sunday
it contained Philadelphia rookie quarterback Donovan McNabb, who
escaped the pocket only three times to scramble for 24 yards.
</P>
<P>
   McNabb completed seven of 17 passes for 49 yards before leaving
the game in the fourth quarter with a knee sprain. Doug Pederson,
who led the Eagles to a 13-10 victory when the teams first met this
year, completed eight of 12 passes for 108 yards and one touchdown
late.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas defense limited the Eagles to 233 yards total
offense, 90 on the ground. The Cowboys didn't allow a touchdown
until 6:41 remained and the game was pretty much out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense is playing wonderful football,'' Sanders said.
``Those guys did a wonderful job of stepping up when Greg went
down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys next host the New York Jets. They wrap up the season
with a road trip to New Orleans, followed by a home game against
the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go into that locker room right now, it's not a sense of
jubilation or anything,'' Gailey said. ``Guys know where we are.''

 RCN TO ACQUIRE 21ST CENTURY TELECOM GROUP  (ms) 
 by SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Expanding its communications footprint from the East Coast to
the Midwest, the RCN Corp. has agreed to acquire the 21st Century
Telecom Group for about $260 million in stock, executives close to
the talks said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is expected to be announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   RCN, based in Princeton, N.J., and operating mainly in the
corridor between Boston and Washington, is the biggest concern
competing against the regional Bell companies in local telephone
markets for residential customers. RCN also provides television and
Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   In October, RCN got a big lift as Vulcan Ventures, Paul Allen's
investment group, invested about $1.7 billion in RCN for a roughly
23 percent stake in the company. The investment by Allen, one of
the founders of Microsoft, gave momentum not only to RCN but also
the general concept that new companies can succeed by competing in
residential communications markets instead of focusing on the more
traditionally lucrative business sector.
</P>
<P>
   Now RCN appears to be trying to put Allen's money to work. 21st
Century is a small local communications carrier based in Chicago, a
market where RCN has not had a major presence. 21st Century had
revenue of only $3 million in the last quarter, compared with $85
million for RCN. But 21st Century is building a valuable asset: a
Chicago-area fiber optic network to which the company has connected
600 buildings.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the stock swap, people close to the negotiations
said RCN would also assume 21st Century's debt of about $250
million. They added that the deal was contingent on 21st Century's
bondholders agreeing to sell their bonds and forgo any additional
interest payments.
</P>
<P>
   The companies are expected to announce that Robert J. Currey,
president and chief executive of 21st Century, will remain in that
position as well as assuming additional responsibilities at RCN.
</P>
<P>
   Salomon Smith Barney acted as financial adviser to RCN, while
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter acted as financial adviser to 21st
Century.

GOP CONTENDERS IN THE SPOTLIGHT MONDAY NIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE 
c.1999 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES _ When the six Republican presidential candidates
take the stage for a debate here Monday night, one question will
probably hang over their contest without being asked: Why did
Senator John McCain decide against competing in the Iowa caucus?
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Arizona senator marches evenly with Texas Governor
George W. Bush in New Hampshire, he has effectively ceded the top
spot to Bush in Iowa, where the first votes in the nominating
process will be cast next month.
</P>
<P>
   Ostensibly, the McCain campaign says that it could not afford to
divide its resources against the $70 million Bush juggernaut and
thus chose to make its stand in New Hampshire. McCain's opposition
to federal subsidies for ethanol, an Iowa product, also has been
cited as a reason.
</P>
<P>
   But there are Iowa Republicans who believe McCain may be missing
an opportunity for early impact.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling a precedent set by Patrick Buchanan in the 1996 Iowa
caucus, when a strong second-place finish energized his followers
in New Hampshire and enabled Buchanan to defeat Bob Dole there, Dee
Stewart, executive director of the Iowa Republican Party, says,
``When the race gets to New Hampshire, McCain may wish, in
hindsight, he had comped here.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack, a Democrat, crossed
party lines to offer his own analysis. ``I think McCain made a
mistake not campaigning here.'' Vilsack dismissedethanol as a
burning issue and said McCain's advocacy of campaign finance reform
``would strike a chord in Iowa.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's spokesman, Howard Opinsky, said Saturday there were no
regrets. ``We anticipated we would make inroads in New Hampshire.
That's one reason we developed the strategy we did.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain will make a rare Iowa appearance Monday when he joins
Bush, magazine magnate Steve Forbes, conservative theoretician Gary
Bauer, Utah Senator Orrin Hatch and commentator Alan Keyes for a
90-minute debate. The debate will be televised on MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   With only six weeks remaining before the Jan. 24 caucus here,
Bush's greatest competition is coming from the far right, where
Forbes and Bauer are battling for support among the Iowa party's
influential Christian conservative constituency. Keyes enjoys a
small, intense following among Iowa opponents of abortion, too, but
has little money to promote his cause.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who wound up in fourth place here four years ago
campaigning for a flat tax, is accentuating the abortion issue in
an effort to appeal to the religious right in 2000. While spending
millions of dolars from his personal fortune, Forbes on Thursday
castigated Bush for ``naming a highway after an abortionist.'' He
cited a 1997 bill, signed by Bush but initiated by others, which
named a portion of a highway in Houston for a prominent doctor who
died earlier in the decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forbes is absolutely a Johnycome-lately on the subject,'' said
Marlys Popma, a long-time leader of anti-abortion forces in Iowa
who is directing Bauer's campaign. ``The thing that bothers me
about Steve Forbe's conversion is his saying `'ve always been
pro-life.' Where was he when we were fighting on the floor for the
pro-life plank at the Republican convention? We've seen him
nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Popma says Bauer, a dedicated opponent of abortion who headed
the Family Research Council before becoming a candidate, ``offers
the full package'' among those on the right challenging Bush. ``He
has an ability to raise money Alan Keyes can't, and he has a better
ability to articulate the message than Steve Forbes.''
</P>
<P>
   The last Des Moines Register poll, published a month ago, found
that Bush had the support of 49 percent of those who said they were
likely to attend the GOP caucuses. He was followed by Forbes with
20 percent, McCain with 8 percent, Bauer with 7 percent, Keyes with
5 percent, and Hatch, a latecomer in the race, with only 1 percent.
Another November survey by PSI, with a plus-minus factor of 5
points, gave Bush 53 percent, Fobes 16 percent, McCain 12 percent
and Bauer 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   According to Stewart, McCain's apparent objective in Iowa ``is
to do nothing, so if he doesn't do well he can write it off. And if
he comes in a strong third, he can say: `Look what I did without
campaigning.' ''
</P>
<P>
   There has been speculation here about what role Brian Kennedy,
the leader of the Republican Party apparatus in Iowa in 1996, is
playing for McCain this year. Kennedy originally went to work for
Lamar Alexander's presidential campaign. After Alexander dropped
out of the race, Kennedy joined McCain's national staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian is an outstanding organizer an political strategist, but
we're not using him in any organizational way in Iowa,'' Opinsky
said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans here say Kennedy has sent some pro-McCain E-mail to
contacts in Iowa. But in a caucus situation, which requires
grassroots organization, it seems doubtful that a stealth campaign
could be set up from a distance against a Bush network that Stewart
calls ``the best in the state _ tenacious and aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's spokesman in Iowa, Eric Woolson, says he expects the race
to tighten. ``That much is a given.'' He expressed satisfaction
with Bush's standing in the state. ``A number of people feel he's a
winner. They feel comfortable with him and his style, the way he
looks them in the eye. He's got integrity and he's able to address
their questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the governor of Texas was no stanger to agriculture,
Woolson said he was confident Bush could handle any arcane
questions on farm policy that might come up in this farm state
Monday night.

COMMENTARY: THE CURSE OF BIGNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Competition is the driving force of free
enterprise. Concentrated power is the greatest danger to
capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   Two government watchdogs are charged with protecting
competition: the Justice Department's antitrust division, a
creature of the executive branch, and the Federal Trade Commission,
an independent agency created by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Oversight pays for itself; indeed, Justice brings in $10 in
fines for every $1 in its budget. But both the FTC and Justice are
overwhelmed by the rising momentum toward concentration throughout
American big business.
</P>
<P>
   If AT&AMP;T ultimately faces off against the proposed
MCI-Worldcom-Sprint merger, the two would control 70 percent of
their market, a monopoly in anybody's league. And monopolies lead
to regulation, with government as the cartel-keeper. A return to
regulation is what we do not want.
</P>
<P>
   Such companies are so big, goes the anti-antitrust argument,
that only another behemoth can compete. But that's how you get down
to two oil companies, two telecommunications combines and two
bank-brokerage-insurance leviathans. The ability for only two to
fix prices or squelch innovation becomes infinitely easier.
</P>
<P>
   Let's explode a few of the myths those superpowers are
spreading:
</P>
<P>
   Myth No. 1: Globalization requires American-based multinational
giants to compete with giants overseas. But the weaknesses of
Japan's keiretsu and South Korea's chaebol have been manifest for a
decade, and Europe is now reacting against the anti-innovative
sclerosis of corporate giantism.
</P>
<P>
   As our trading partners discover the economic blessings of
antitrust enforcement, why should the United States now take the
route of semi-monopoly? That only leads to another cycle of
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Myth No. 2: Democrats crack down on too-big business, while
Republicans defend it. In truth, enforcement has been a mixed bag.
Teddy Roosevelt invented trust-busting; Dwight Eisenhower's Justice
Department aggressively defended competition. Compared with them,
Republican Reagan's record (except for AT&AMP;T) was poor and Democrat
Clinton's (except for Microsoft) is fair.
</P>
<P>
   Myth No. 3: If a cartel or an industry with only two companies
can deliver the efficiencies of low cost, the consumer benefits.
This ``Chicago school'' theory of the '80s made deregulation and
apparent consumer benefit our mantra _ but have you noticed what
monopoly hubs have done to airline fares and service? Clinton
antitrust finally moved against American Airlines, but other big
carriers are getting away with skyway robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Myth No. 4: Mere size is no sin; each case should be handled on
its own merits. Under this philosophy, the FTC smiles on the
Exxon-Mobil merger, says maybe to Dow-Union Carbide and probably no
to BP Amoco and Atlantic Richfield. But it is the momentum of
merger mania that cries out to be reversed; long-range impact is
not being considered.
</P>
<P>
   Myth No. 5: Technology is changing so fast that a little
pipsqueak company can bring a giant to its knees. For every time
that happens, a thousand small-cap operations are driven out of
business or absorbed by the giant out to cover its corporate
posterior. When competition gets down to two huge entities, it
becomes an arrangement that can buy congressional protection.
</P>
<P>
   On that last myth, the megamerger crowd _ oligarchs who enjoy
the safety of hugeness, with their go-go investment bankers and
not-to-worry lawyers _ insists that opponents to upsizing cannot
foresee changes to come.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Foer, at antitrustinstitute.org, derides such
``proclaimed fears of future competition.'' He notes that the
antitrust law's key phrases _ ``may lessen competition'' and ``tend
to create a monopoly'' _ use verbs that require a forecast of the
future. In that prediction business, we should err on the side of
competition.
</P>
<P>
   I had breakfast with Joel Klein, the current antitrust chief. He
says all the right philosophic things: ``If you don't have
antitrust enforcement, you get government regulation, which is
worse.'' And on the rash of innovation-stifling megamergers, which
one of his successors will one day have to break up? ``Not getting
married is preferable to divorce.''
</P>
<P>
   But the conservative zeal to protect competition _ beyond the
minuet of the monoliths _ is missing in Congress and the White
House, and is not mentioned on the campaign trail. Embittered
divorces lie ahead.

U.N. SECRETARY - GENERAL MAKES PLEA FOR ISRAEL
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, in an unambiguous
plea for better treatment of Israel at the United Nations, said
Sunday in a speech that actions taken by member nations to isolate
Israel and single it out for the harshest criticisms on Middle
Eastern issues have made the organization appear biased.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the American Jewish Committee here, Annan called
for rebuilding links between the United Nations and Jews, in Israel
and other countries. ``The question is not whether the United
Nations and the Jewish community should be closer partners,'' he
said. ``Rather, the key issue is how we shall get from here to
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan's remarks Sunday echoed a speech he made in Israel in
March 1998 that was seen as a turning point by many Jews in their
dealings with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that to some of you in this audience, and to the Jewish
community at large, it has sometimes seemed that the United Nations
served all the world's peoples but one: the Jews,'' he said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The speech to the American Jewish Committee, which has long been
involved in international affairs and human rights, marks another
step in the increasingly bold direction Annan is taking as
secretary-general, three years into his five-year term.
</P>
<P>
   In September, he startled the General Assembly by tossing aside
the usual bland summary opening speech and arguing for overriding
national sovereignty when governments abuse their citizens. That
has set off a heated debate around the world, and brought some
sharp criticism down on Annan, whose job many countries would like
to keep ceremonial.
</P>
<P>
   Israel was an active member of the United Nations in its early
years. But with Israel's battlefield victories in 1967 and 1973 and
the long occupation of what Palestinians regard as their
territories, a coalition of developing nations in the Middle East,
Africa and Asia began concerted attacks on Israel in the United
Nations in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, the General Assembly voted to equate Zionism with
racism, and Israel's right to take part in many U.N. activities was
challenged while special scrutiny, often amounting to hounding
Israel, took place in various sections of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Annan's speech Sunday was at a dinner honoring Morris Abram, an
American civil rights lawyer who founded the private organization
U.N. Watch in Geneva in 1993 to monitor the treatment of Israel and
other issues. In the speech, Annan expressed displeasure at the
continuing refusal of nations to admit Israel to a regional
grouping within the United Nations. This and other actions, he
said, ``have given a regrettable impression of bias and
one-sidedness.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel, frozen out of the Asian bloc, which includes the Arab
countries, is the only nation without membership in any regional
group. That means it cannot hold a rotating Security Council seat
or important committee positions, which are filled through
nominations from regional caucuses. A move to give Israel temporary
membership in the ``European and other'' group has been blocked by
several European nations.
</P>
<P>
   Annan noted that the resolution equating Zionism with racism was
repealed nine years ago and that anti-Semitism had been added to
the list of racist attitudes the General Assembly wanted to
eliminate. ``Even so,'' he said, ``deep and painful scars remain _
for the United Nations, I should stress, as much as for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan said that the tragedy of the estrangement between the
organization and Israel was compounded by the circumstances of the
U.N.'s founding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indeed, the United Nations will never forget its origins in
the fight against fascism, and that its charter was drafted as the
world was learning the full horrors of the Holocaust,'' he said.
``This history makes it especially sad that such a gulf arose
between us.''
</P>
<P>
   Abram, whom the committee honored Sunday with its National
Distinguished Leadership Award, served five American presidents
from John Kennedy to George Bush, who appointed him the U.S.
representative at the United Nations in Geneva. As a young lawyer,
he worked on the Nuremberg trials, which brought Nazis to justice
after World War II.  &QL;

DESPITE PUBLIC OPPOSITION, EXPERTS SUPPORT HOV LANES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY STEVE CARNEY 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- While Caltrans' numbers show car-pool lanes in
the San Fernando Valley are carrying more people with fewer cars
than regular lanes, opposition remains strong, with one assemblyman
proposing an ``HOV Holiday.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet with construction of a high-occupancy-vehicle lane through
the Sepulveda Pass on the 405 Freeway, Caltrans is forging ahead
with its plan to create a necklace of diamond lanes circling Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of car-pool lanes, on the other hand, see a choker.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Tom McClintock, R-Granada Hills, said the easiest
way to reduce gridlock on freeways is to ``sandblast the diamond
off the pavement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole stated reason for diamond lanes is to increase car
pooling, and it doesn't,'' he said. ``All they're doing is
rearranging existing traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   He has sponsored AB 44 in the Assembly Transportation Committee
that would order a ``Diamond Lane Holiday'' on all freeways in the
state pending an engineering study to justify their usefulness.
That would indefinitely open the HOV lanes to all traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of car-pool lanes say McClintock is misguided.
</P>
<P>
   ``By and large, in L.A. County the HOV system is a great
success,'' said Deborah Redman, a senior transportation planner
with the Southern California Association of Governments, which
tries to foster ride-sharing through its 1-800-COMMUTE hot line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's reducing overall congestion, and maintaining at least one
opportunity for people to move at normal speeds _ if they car
pool,'' she said. ``It's ironic _ because they work, they look
empty.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Where there are car-pool lanes, they seem to be working,
according to Caltrans figures.
</P>
<P>
   An HOV lane on the 170 Freeway carries about the same number of
people as a regular lane during the evening commute _ 1,530 people
per hour at Sherman Way compared to 1,494. But they do it in half
as many cars _ 641 to 1,243 _ zipping along in their unclogged
lane.
</P>
<P>
   Morning car poolers on the 405 Freeway aren't quite so lucky _
the southbound HOV lane at Burbank Boulevard has about the same
number of vehicles as the regular lanes _ 1,128 per hour compared
to 1,245. But those cars are carrying twice as many people _ 2,665
compared to 1,350.
</P>
<P>
   And Dawn Helou, senior traffic engineer with Caltrans, said
that's exactly what the HOV is supposed to do _ carry more people
in fewer cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a limited capacity here. We have to focus on moving
people,'' she said, saying HOV critics ``are focused on moving
vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, car-pool lanes draw the ire of people from Southern
California to New Jersey, which has eliminated some car-pool lanes.
In Northern California, HOV lanes have been opened to all commuters
during certain hours.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who say they're a waste of pavement and should
be opened to all traffic. Others say they're under-used and should
be enhanced with peak-hour tolls and express commuter buses. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; McClintock contends that much traffic in the diamond lanes
consists of parents taking their children to school, or couples
traveling together, or other groups that would be traveling
together anyway _ car-pool lanes or no.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of Southern California commuters car pooling
dropped from 15.6 percent to 14.3 percent from 1996 to 1998,
according to the biannual State of the Commute report from the
Southern California Association of Governments. But the 1998 figure
is still an increase over the 13.1 percent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Opening car-pool lanes would simply add more cars to the road,
critics say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to fill up instantly. There's more demand than that
lane can possibly handle,'' argued Kenneth Green, director of the
environmental program at the L.A.-based Reason Public Policy
Institute, a non-profit think tank that examines transportation and
other issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``That seems to be a waste of a good opportunity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Reason Institute advocates turning the HOV lanes into HOT _
high-occupancy toll _ lanes. Those would allow solo drivers to join
the car poolers and buses in the HOV lanes, for a fee that would
increase during peak hours. That would allow drivers on urgent
trips to get there quicker, and generate money that could be used
for other transportation solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Changing HOV lanes to mixed-flow lanes, available for all
traffic, would be tantamount to adding an entire new lane to the
freeway, proponents say. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Helou, senior traffic engineer with Caltrans, said the addition
of an extra lane to the 101 Freeway in 1992 didn't help Valley
congestion. The extra lane was originally slated to be HOV, until
local opposition made it a mixed-flow lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``The congestion is worse today than when we had four lanes.
There's no incentive to rideshare,'' she said. ``It promoted growth
and it promoted the wrong kind of growth.''
</P>
<P>
   It now carries legions of solo drivers commuting from sprawling
suburbs in the West Valley and beyond, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Diamond lanes are a sometime thing in the San Francisco Bay
Area, where the car-pool restrictions are enforced only during rush
hours, said Greg Bayol, Caltrans public affairs director for the
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a different philosophy'' from the agency's L.A.
office, he said. ``Our traffic operates differently.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Bay Area converted an HOV lane to mixed-flow.
The 580 Freeway going through Richmond didn't have enough
congestion to make a car-pool lane worthwhile, Bayol said.
</P>
<P>
   McClintock decried HOV lanes as part of a failed policy designed
``to tell people how they'll get to work in the morning.'' He said
the majority of motorists have already made their choice, opting
for the convenience of driving their own cars.
</P>
<P>
   And rather than the ``social engineering'' of imposing car-pool
lanes on drivers, he pointed to the example of New Jersey, which
eliminated car-pool lanes at the behest of drivers and lawmakers
there.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1998, New Jersey converted HOV lanes on Interstates
80 and 287 into regular traffic lanes, after getting assurances
from the federal government the state wouldn't have to repay
federal money used to build them.
</P>
<P>
   The lanes moved traffic within sprawling suburban areas with no
centralized business districts, said John Dourgarian, spokesman for
the New Jersey Department of Transportation. ``It was difficult for
people to car pool. They were coming from all over and going to
different work places.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The agency studied the 30 miles of lanes on the two interstates
and found they didn't meet expectations for creating new car pools,
carrying enough people or reducing congestion. And drivers hated
them _ at times up to 50 percent of the lanes' users were solo
drivers flouting the law.
</P>
<P>
   After studying the usefulness of the 30 miles of lanes,
considering future congestion and listening to the clamor from
motorists worried about safety and convenience, New Jersey finally
decided to decommission the HOV lanes.
</P>
<P>
   But HOV lanes haven't been cast out of the Garden State
entirely. They're still popular on the New Jersey Turnpike heading
into New York City, and a lane going into the Lincoln Tunnel
reserved for commuters in express buses and van pools is always
packed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are thousands of buses going to Manhattan every day,''
Dourgarian said. ``Every morning it's like a train of buses going
in, and they're all filled to capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the New Jersey example cited by HOV advocates, who say
Los Angeles also needs a system of public and private buses and
jitneys to share the HOV lanes and carry commuters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Car-pool lanes by themselves don't work. We need other
incentives,'' said Gloria Ohland, spokeswoman for the Surface
Transportation Policy Project, a non-profit consortium of groups
studying traffic and sprawl issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been better to invest in public transit than
car-pool lanes. That said, I think the worst possible thing would
be to turn car-pool lanes into mixed-flow lanes,'' she said.
``Ultimately the problem is we have too many cars, too much air
pollution and the more room we make on the road for
single-occupancy vehicles, the worse off we'll be.''

THOUGH GRIEVING FOR TUDJMAN, MANY CROATS WANT CHANGE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAGREB, Croatia _ Anka Sedarevic became breathless while
expressing her respect and devotion to President Franjo Tudjman,
who died Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Sedarevic, 72, was taking a free bus to join a line of
several thousand people who waited up to three hours to file past
Tudjman's coffin and to write a few words in a fat book of
remembrance. ``He gave us our Croatia, and we waited for it a very
long time,'' she said. ``He lived and died for Croatia.''
</P>
<P>
   Tudjman founded an independent Croatia in 1991 from the remains
of the Communist Yugoslavia he helped to destroy. In August 1995
his troops drove out many of the Serbs who lived in Croatia and
opposed independence, especially in the Krajina region in southwest
Croatia, around Knin.
</P>
<P>
   Asked for her strongest memory of Tudjman, Mrs. Sedarevic said
it was ``when he kissed the flag on the Knin fort, and his happy
face.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Sedarevic says she intends to vote for the opposition
in coming parliamentary elections on Jan. 3, spurning Tudjman's
governing party, the Croatian Democratic Union, known as the HDZ.
``I won't vote for them,'' she said with nearly equal fervor. ``I'm
voting for the opposition. It's time for change.''
</P>
<P>
   Unhappiness with a wretched economy, high taxes, late pension
and salary payments and widespread corruption has undermined
support for the governing party, even from those who devoted their
Sunday morning to standing in the chill to honor Tudjman.
</P>
<P>
   A six-party opposition coalition is expected to win the
elections. That would mark the first peaceful change of authority
here, despite the governing party's firm control over the state
media.
</P>
<P>
   Together with the peaceful transition under way in Macedonia,
another former Yugoslav republic, with the election of a new
president, the shift in Croatia could help to persuade a weaker
democratic opposition in Serbia to surmount its own bitter
divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Croatia's governing party is thought to be particularly strong
among the elderly. But Ankica Bojic, too, wants an opposition
victory. With curly gray hair and large glasses, Mrs. Bojic, 65, a
retired textile worker, said that Tudjman's party had made ``many
mistakes,'' and that ``older people still feel like we live in the
old Yugoslavia, with bad pensions, and we're not so enchanted by
all this.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Bojic, with her granddaughter, Iva Bojic, 14, waited
for hours to pass by Tudjman's coffin. ``He was our first president
and he made our state,'' Mrs. Bojic said. ``We don't want to have
Serbs in Yugoslavia over our heads. So I went up there to pay my
respects.''
</P>
<P>
   Iva said she waited for three hours to have a minute inside the
presidential palace, where Tudjman lay surrounded by flags,
flowers, an honor guard and the many medals he had awarded himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I went, but I'm freezing,'' she said. She wants to be
an actress and go abroad, to make money, she said, wondering how to
find a pen pal on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Did she write something in the book of remembrance? Iva,
embarrassed, said she had. ``I wrote that `you did a lot for us and
I'm very grateful,' '' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bojic simply wrote her name. ``I want life to be better for
the young people,'' she said. ``They will have a better chance with
the opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps 20,000 Croatians had filed by Tudjman's coffin by
evening, officials said. He will be buried Monday after a state
funeral in Mirogoj Cemetery in Zagreb, led by Archbishop Josip
Bozanic, the country's Roman Catholic primate, who in the past has
used key sermons to speak out against the poverty and inequalities
that came to characterize Tudjman's era.
</P>
<P>
   Church bells will toll for 10 minutes throughout the country,
and there will be an official Mass in Zagreb Cathedral in the early
evening.
</P>
<P>
   Three days of official mourning, with sports and entertainment
events canceled and movie theaters closed, will end Monday at
midnight, and official campaigning for the new Parliament will
probably begin Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A new president must be elected within 60 days, but the parties
have not yet selected their candidates. Foreign Minister Mate
Granic is one of the favorites, but he is considered a moderate in
the governing party, and the powerful deputy speaker of Parliament,
Vladimir Seks, a hard-line nationalist, is also likely to be a
contender.
</P>
<P>
   Tudjman's funeral will bring many foreign dignitaries here, but
the level of representation is likely to disappoint the government.
The prime ministers of Turkey and Hungary will attend, as well as
high officials from neighboring countries. But the United States,
which in recent years has had strained relations with Tudjman's
government, will be represented only by its ambassador, William
Montgomery.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Only last week, the United States and Montgomery were sharply
attacked here by state-controlled newspapers and television, which
accused them of coordinating intelligence activities and
nongovernmental organizations to try to bring down the governing
party.
</P>
<P>
   In language reminiscent of that of President Slobodan Milosevic
in Serbia, the Croatian media accused Washington of financing and
instructing the political opposition here, implying that the
opposition was disloyal to the state.
</P>
<P>
   American officials are convinced that Croatian intelligence
services regularly bug their conversations and are responsible for
break-ins at two apartments used by diplomats, although no
listening devices have been found.
</P>
<P>
   Andrija Artukovic, 69, said he had been waiting for more than
two hours to pay his respects to the late president. ``It's not
hard for me to wait for Tudjman,'' he said simply. ``This was our
first president, and I'm very thankful to him. He made this country
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Artukovic said he was jailed in 1951, at the age of 20, ``only
for being a Croat.'' He was in the Yugoslav Army, based in
Macedonia, and said he had been jailed for ``propaganda against
Tito, because I didn't perform my devotions to the president as I
should.''
</P>
<P>
   He then left the country and his family to work in Germany, as a
mechanic in a Porsche factory, and returned here to live in 1992.
``I couldn't have come back sooner,'' he said. ``They might have
arrested me again. So I waited for an independent Croatia.''
</P>
<P>
   And will he vote for the opposition? Artukovic said he would.
``President Tudjman made this country for us,'' he said. Still, he
added, ``There can't be a democracy without an opposition.''

GIANTS' COLLINS OUTPLAYS FLUTIE AND DOES SOME CHEERLEADING 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. _ It was almost comical around the Giants
last week, with the cavalcade of injuries on the defense melding
with the aura of Doug Flutie to create a sense of invincibility
about the Bills _ and a sense of doom for the Giants, who had to
play them.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing they were given no shot in Sunday's game, the Giants
eagerly played along, engaging in gallows humor about their
predicament. But as the week went on, most Giants quietly concluded
something quite different: This was a game they could steal.
</P>
<P>
   So with 2 minutes 9 seconds left in the final quarter Sunday,
when Giants quarterback Kerry Collins entered the team's huddle and
screamed, ``We're going to win this game,'' there was no surprise
among his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   And 53 seconds later, when the Giants needed at least five more
yards to attempt what would become the game-winning field goal,
Collins did not wrangle with the assistant coach Sean Payton, who
was fretting over what play to call.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dude, just call it,'' Collins told Payton. ``We'll get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a 5-yard pass from Collins to Pete Mitchell followed and
soon Cary Blanchard's 48-yard field goal was spinning through the
uprights, the final act in a stirring, unforeseen 19-17 Giants
victory over the Bills at Ralph Wilson Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, who only two weeks ago were the losers of three
straight and on the verge of coming apart at the seams, have a
winning record at 7-6, still have not lost a regular-season game in
December under Coach Jim Fassel and are again legitimate playoff
contenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We proved that last week's win over the Jets wasn't a fluke,''
said Collins, who had another sparkling day, outplaying Flutie as
he led the Giants on five scoring drives. ``We never thought it was
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants defense, playing without the starting cornerbacks
Jason Sehorn and Phillippi Sparks, held the Bills' offense to only
237 yards and essentially one touchdown. Buffalo's second
touchdown, which gave it a 17-16 fourth-quarter lead, was a 2-yard
run by Jonathan Linton, but it was set up by a 52-yard interception
return of a deflected Collins pass by Buffalo tackle Marcellus
Wiley.
</P>
<P>
   The field day most anticipated Flutie to have against the
reserve cornerbacks Emmanuel McDaniel and Jeremy Lincoln never
materialized. On the first Bills play, Flutie threw 36 yards down
the sideline to Eric Moulds, with McDaniel in tow.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be the high-water mark for the Bills' passing
attack as they never completed another pass of that length or
longer. Fittingly, a desperation pass on the game's final play by
Flutie, who completed 15 of 32 passes for 184 yards, was
intercepted by Bashir Levingston.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants used the offensive formula that worked a week ago,
with Joe Montgomery running for 77 yards and Collins completing 23
of 44 passes to five receivers and 240 passing yards.
</P>
<P>
   Still it was a seesaw, absorbing game, with Blanchard making
three field goals before his game-winner as the Giants came from
behind three times. When the Bills went up by 3-0, the Giants
rallied to take a 6-3 lead. When Buffalo led by 10-6, Collins led
the Giants on a 10-play drive in the final two minutes before
halftime, connecting with Amani Toomer for a precisely timed, crisp
14-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants were aided by Bills kicker Steve Christie, usually
one of the National Football League's best, who missed field goals
from 39 and 48 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Bills had a 1-point lead and the ball at the Giants'
36-yard line with slightly more than two minutes to play. Ninety
seconds earlier, Flutie seemed to have won the game, scrambling for
12 yards on a third-and-9 when four different Giants could not
catch him on a zany dash back and forth across the field. Facing a
fourth-and-1, Coach Wade Phillips chose to go for it.
</P>
<P>
   If that proved to be the wrong decision, it was made worse by
the play called, which was a simple dive up the middle by Linton.
Defensive tackle Keith Hamilton met Linton in the backfield,
grabbing his legs. Safety Sam Garnes vaulted over the top to
complete the job _ a telling stop on a day when the Giants held the
Bills to only 76 yards rushing.
</P>
<P>
   Soon Collins was trotting into the huddle, yelling at his
teammates, something he later said he did not remember doing.
Collins, however, spent the rest of the drive calmly leading the
Giants downfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kerry is very confident in those situations,'' running back
Tiki Barber said. ``It makes us all believe in him.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Barber who made probably the biggest play in the drive.
Facing a third-and-15 at their 49, the Giants called a trick screen
play: They faked a screen to the left, and when the linebacker
assigned to cover Barber drifted to that area, Barber cut back to
the middle of the field, where Collins found him with a pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it a man beater,'' said Barber, who talked Payton into
running the play with a one-back formation because he knew it meant
he would face man-to-man coverage. ``I was killing the linebacker
all day. I told them I can beat him.''
</P>
<P>
   Barber, who caught eight passes, was referring to linebacker
Marlo Perry, whom he did run past as he broke free over the middle.
With a burst of speed that was missing last year, Barber sprinted
to a 15-yard gain before Buffalo's defense collapsed on him at the
Bills' 36.
</P>
<P>
   Two incomplete passes under pressure left the Giants with a
third-and-10. Before the game, Fassel had decided the line of
scrimmage would have to be the 30-yard line for him to allow
Blanchard to attempt a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew we had to at least move it up 5 or 6 yards,'' Collins
said.
</P>
<P>
   Payton called a play with several options but Collins, who would
roll to his right, knew he would look first for Mitchell, his best
third-down option.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just give me time,'' Collins said to his lineman as he clapped
his hands to exit the huddle. And the Giants' line protected
Collins, who was not sacked in the game.
</P>
<P>
   It became a 5-yard pass play to Mitchell, enough to advance the
ball to the 31-yard line. Close enough, Fassel said, and sent
Blanchard in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought about doing anything else,'' Fassel later
said.
</P>
<P>
   Blanchard, who has yet to miss an important field goal since he
was signed Oct. 20 to replace the injured Brad Daluiso, made the
field goal with a little right-to-left draw that split the goal
posts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a significant win,'' said Fassel, who like many of his
players was at ease last week and impishly confident. ``That was a
statement.'' &QL;

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
IRVING _ Emmitt Smith was the lucky one. He got to pull his groin
after the first play and leave.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody else had to stay for the whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   Head coach Chan Gailey said they are a team on a mission.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Troy Aikman said they were taking care of business.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you've been following the Cowboys at all through
this meandering season, you know those two descriptions are
actually one and the same.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to require a mission or a sense of impending doom for
the Cowboys to take care of their business, and so a 20-10 victory
over the punchless Eagles is regarded as a feat akin to those early
solo flights across the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a game that we needed to win,'' said Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a great team victory over a very good football
team,'' Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Which only says that when it comes to getting fixed up on a
blind date, you'd be better served by relying on the eye and the
taste of the QB over the coach.
</P>
<P>
   What the Cowboys accomplished Sunday was the equivalent of not
falling down at the start of a marathon and getting stomped on by
so many thousands of feet.
</P>
<P>
   For there are still three games left in the regular season, and
so many things can happen, almost none of them good if Dallas
doesn't win out and grab the NFC East title.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, with a remaining schedule that is currently weaker
than Charles Barkley's left knee _ home against the Jets, at New
Orleans, home against the Giants _ anything less than winning out
to finish at 10-6, and the Cowboys would be deserving of any bad
hand fate might deal them in the so-called playoff race.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, anything less than a division title, and Dallas
could be looking at an offseason of changes in high places. Namely,
the head coach's spot, which may be why Gailey was ready to make a
grand pronouncement after one in a row.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the season, Gailey has listened to the criticism of
his passive offensive philosophy and responded by serving up just
more helpings of an attack that would make day-old oatmeal look
exciting.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, though, with the season still teetering on the brink at
6-6, Gailey finally took off the wraps, and the result was the kind
of production that does not make a team feel like it should back up
to the pay window.
</P>
<P>
   Here was a Cowboys team going all but one play without its
workhorse Smith and never losing its gallop. Chris Warren filled
the hole, running for 92 yards and a touchdown on 25 carries.
</P>
<P>
   What's more impressive _ and what could portend good things
coming down the stretch _ was a willingness to open up the offense,
going down the field for longer passes and spreading the ball
around to eight receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman has spent much of a morose season complaining that he is
not at all comfortable with his receiving corps, that he
appreciates the deep threat provided by Rocket Ismail but misses
his old buddy Michael Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   So Gailey finally turns him loose to throw 40 passes, gets
Aikman in position to roll out and away from pressure frequently,
and suddenly he's as comfortable as if sitting in a La-Z-Boy.
Everyone from Ismail to David LaFleur to Warren to Jason Tucker to
Eric Bjornson caught passes that gained at least 16 yards, and the
Cowboys looked like the aggressors rather than part of the scenery.
</P>
<P>
   LaFleur, the third-year tight end who was supposed to be a big
weapon, finally looked the part, hauling in four balls for 44 yards
and a TD. Deion Sanders jumped over to offense for more than a
handful of plays and caught just two passes. But his mere presence
on the field attracted the attention of the Eagles' defense and
opened opportunities for others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can do more, and I'm sure I will,'' said Prime Time.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' defense, which has propped up the team for most of
the year, suffered two significant hits when Greg Ellis went down
with a broken left leg and Kevin Mathis sprained his left knee, but
it still managed to pick off one Donovan McNabb pass and recover
two fumbles.
</P>
<P>
   All of which made for a drab, routine win over a 3-10 team in a
season when there has been no reason for anyone to fear the Cowboys
or regard them as real contenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't put together back-to-back victories since we
started 3-0,'' said Aikman. ``At 7-6, it's a little early to be
talking Super Bowl or anything like that. What we have to do is
beat the Jets, beat New Orleans, beat the Giants and see where we
are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to know how much the team has progressed
week-to-week. I don't know if we did or we didn't. We won.''
</P>
<P>
   And there hasn't been enough of that to say much else.

LAND-PROTECTION PLAN GOES TO PRESIDENT AMID PROTESTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Calif., Utah)   (Exclusive) 
 (lb) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The Clinton administration is a step closer to
designating three new national monuments in Arizona and California,
a change in status that would add restrictions on access and use.
</P>
<P>
   A letter from Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt recommending the
action is expected to reach the White House on Monday for President
Clinton's approval, administration officials said Sunday. Babbitt,
who has been leading the effort to turn more federal lands into
monuments, is expected to recommend additional changes in the
remaining months of the administration.
</P>
<P>
   While leading Republicans in Congress strongly object to
monument declarations as an inappropriate use of the Antiquities
Act of 1906 and an end run around Congress, the administration
officials said Clinton would likely read the recommendations on
Monday and act on them early in the new year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the president wants to exercise executive authority
very carefully,'' said a senior White House official. ``But I also
know he has a very strong view that he has responsibility to future
generations to provide protection for areas like these. This is a
legacy issue for him that I'm sure he is looking at favorably.''
</P>
<P>
   The lands Babbitt is recommending for monument status are 1
million acres along the northern rim of the Grand Canyon in
Arizona, 71,000 acres around Perry Mesa and Black Mesa near
Flagstaff, Ariz., and the thousands of islands, rocks and exposed
reefs within 12 miles of the California coast.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt is also proposing that Pinnacles National Monument east
of Salinas, Calif., be expanded by nearly 8,000 acres to protect
watersheds and habitats for an array of birds, amphibians and
reptiles.
</P>
<P>
   The four areas in question are managed by the federal Bureau of
Land Management, which imposes minimal restrictions on use and
access. Monument status would protect the areas from recreational
and commercial overuse.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton needs little more than his signature to act on the
recommendations. The Antiquities Act allows presidents to use an
executive order to change the status of federal lands that have
scientific, historic or archaeological significance. Since it was
passed, every president except Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan
has designated at least one national monument. Now there are more
than 100 around the country.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months Babbitt has spent considerable time and energy
building support for declaring up to a dozen federally owned areas
as national monuments. So far, Clinton has designated only one new
one, Grand Staircase-Escalante, a 1.9-million-acre area in southern
Utah.
</P>
<P>
   But that declaration, in 1996, fueled a running battle between
the Republican-led Congress and the White House, in which federal
lawmakers have disputed the legal grounds upon which the Clinton
administration is basing its right to invoke the act.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The chairman of the House national parks and public lands
subcommittee, Rep. James Hansen, R-Utah, contends that the act was
intended only for relatively small areas, not the expansive areas
in Babbitt's recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen introduced legislation this year that would restrict the
president's discretionary powers over federal lands. Efforts to
reach Hansen on Sunday were unsuccessful. He did not respond to a
message left with an aide.
</P>
<P>
   But in a speech before the House in April, Hansen sharply
criticized the White House for the Grand Staircase designation,
charging that the administration had its eyes on
``multimillion-acre national monuments to score a few extra votes
in the next election.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracy isn't always pretty,'' Hansen said then. ``But I
think we can all agree that it is a lot better than having a king
dictate everything from the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the proposed use of the Antiquities Act has angered
ranchers, mining companies and cattle producers who contend that
new restrictions on land use, especially in the West, increase
costs, reduce productivity and eliminate jobs _ claims that the
administration has denied.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, environmental groups have routinely supported
greater protections for public lands, and some political analysts
say that by designating more national monuments in the final months
of his term, Clinton would help solidify environmentalists' support
for Vice President Al Gore in his quest for the presidency next
year.

GAO ISSUES WARNING ON CENSUS ACCURACY
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Less than four months from the start of the 2000
census on April 1, a General Accounting Office report is warning
that the Census Bureau's current plans may produce a count that is
less accurate than that of 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting office, the investigative arm of Congress,
singled out the Census Bureau's decision not to send a second
questionnaire to households that do not respond to the first form
that the agency mails as a reason for its finding. The agency also
expressed concern that the tight labor market might make it
difficult for the Census Bureau to hire the large number of
temporary workers it will need.
</P>
<P>
   In a draft report, the agency says that the bureau ``faces some
significant risks, that, taken together, continue to jeopardize the
success of the 2000 census.''
</P>
<P>
   The report said the census next year would cost $6.2 billion,
almost twice as much as the $3.2 billion spent on the 1990 census,
which was by far the most expensive in history.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, the report suggested, the 2000 census may not be as
accurate as the one in 1990, which was estimated to have missed 8
million people and counted another 4 million twice, for an
undercount of about 4 million people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It raises concerns,'' George Walker, communications director
for the House Subcommittee on the Census, said of the accounting
office report. ``Many of these concerns, like doing a second
mailing, are ones that we've raised before in hearings, or in
specific legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators for the accounting office said that the Census
Bureau might ``be optimistic'' when it estimated that 61 percent of
households would complete and return the census forms that were
sent to them. The report said the agency's decision not to mail a
second form to households that had not returned the first could
hold down the response rate.
</P>
<P>
   Census Bureau officials took issue with the report, noting that
last September the accounting office issued another report
declaring the bureau's estimates of the form-return rate were
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Prewitt, director of the Census Bureau, said, ``We're a
little surprised that the same agency says we are too conservative
and then turns around after a few months and says we are too
optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Census officials opted not to do a second mailing out of concern
that it would lead to households' being counted twice.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The issue of the response rate is a critical one. Estimates are
that each percentage point below 61 percent will add another $25
million to the cost of the census, mainly from sending census
takers to the unresponding homes to get the information. Lower
census-return rates also increase the possibility of error, since
mailed responses tend to be more accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt had already said that if the mail-response rate fell
below 61 percent, ``we will have a real hard time conducting the
census.''
</P>
<P>
   The accounting office report also suggested that the Census
Bureau's efforts to count and question those who failed to return
their forms might be hampered by difficulties in hiring enough
census-takers.
</P>
<P>
   The report noted that the Census Bureau would need about 860,000
temporary workers, known as enumerators, next year. High turnover
rates in these positions means that to maintain a work force that
large, the Census Bureau will have to recruit nearly 3.5 million
people, which is about the population of South Carolina, for jobs
that do not offer benefits like insurance or child care.
</P>
<P>
   The report recommended that the Census Bureau and Congress
develop contingency plans to avert potential problems for the next
census. Some of the specific recommendations included passing
legislation to lift the ban on hiring noncitizens and federal
employees, including active-duty military personnel, for work as
part-time enumerators and allowing people to work in the job
without losing Social Security, veterans, Medicaid and welfare
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the report makes no mention of the most contentious issues
that has swirled around the census: statistical sampling, the
method whose opponents say is illegal and supporters contend could
address the very concerns raised by the accounting office report.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the accounting office declined to comment on the
report beyond calling it a draft document whose main findings might
change, depending on the response from the Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Senior officials at the Census Bureau say their estimates of the
response rate were made prior to the development of the $102
million advertising campaign developed by Young &AMP; Rubicam to get
people to respond to the census forms. As a result, they say, the
form-return rate may exceed 61 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Census Bureau officials said they had no difficulty in hiring
enough people in 1998 for the dress rehearsals of the 2000 census,
indicating that if a sufficient wage is offered, the Census Bureau
will not have a problem hiring temporary staff members.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., said she would sponsor legislation
that would create a $100 million contingency fund that could be
used for such emergencies as increasing salaries to attract more
census workers.

THE BIG, BIG JOB OF MAINTAINING A BOEING 737 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Sitting on huge steel jacks in a maintenance
hangar here, the big, gray Boeing 737, tail No. N-1383, was in for
some serious work.
</P>
<P>
   A floor beam under the aft galley was rusting; the steel tracks
that guide the wing flaps were wearing out, and engineers suspected
that the cargo doors were developing hidden cracks. The plane's
maintenance report over the past month formed a computer printout
about 15 feet long, and the Federal Aviation Administration, in
response to airplane crashes, had demanded that United Airlines,
the plane's operator, install a better flight data recorder and a
firefighting system in the cargo holds, among other changes. In
all, the plane needed about 50 changes, plus extensive routine
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   The situation seemed to prove the aviation adage that a plane is
a collection of spare parts flying in close formation. But
Frederick Mohr, managing director of United Airlines' maintenance
center here, called N-1383 a ``pretty good airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   Passenger jets like N-1383 usually get close public scrutiny
only after fatal accidents. At that point, every broken part they
ever flew with, every flaw that was waiting to be corrected, every
malady that any plane of that type ever experienced, takes on an
ominous aura.
</P>
<P>
   But the everyday reality for planes like N-1383, which is based
at United's San Francisco hub and makes short flights around
California, is far different. With hundreds of thousands of parts,
multiple redundant systems, elaborate monitoring systems and a
strict maintenance regimen, the plane is almost always available,
able to safely carry 126 passengers in coach and eight in first
class, and even safely sustain a variety of part failures in
flight.
</P>
<P>
   The plane almost always needs work, however. Today was ``day
three of 19,'' as described by Robert Corriveau, the team leader
for the hangar section where 215 mechanics were stripping pieces
off the plane, like insects on the carcass of a giant bird.
</P>
<P>
   In its 10-year lifetime, in 30,166 hours of flight, the plane
has never had an engine fail or had to be shut down in flight, and
if it is a typical United plane _ the airline's engines are more
reliable than most others _ it will not have that problem for years
to come. In 20,080 flights, it has never had to return to an
airport or divert on the way to a destination because of a
mechanical problem.
</P>
<P>
   The airline has had to report to the FAA on problems involving
N-1383 on three occasions, all relatively minor incidents involving
lights that were not working correctly. One involved floor lighting
for emergency escapes, another the light on an emergency exit
slide, and the third an indicator light that flickered instead of
correctly showing whether the plane's wing slats were retracted in
flight. The pilot had to look out of a window of the passenger
cabin to see that the slats were functioning properly.
</P>
<P>
   But the history of airline crashes is, in a way, carved into the
hardware of this airplane. For example, in May 1996, a ValuJet DC-9
took off with improperly packed hazardous cargo that caught fire,
causing the plane to crash. On this visit, N-1383 was having smoke
detectors and fire-suppression systems installed in its forward and
aft cargo holds.
</P>
<P>
   The inspection itself is partly a result of an incident in which
the roof peeled away in flight on an Aloha Airlines 737 in April
1988. (The plane landed safely.) Some of the flaws found are not
easily detected. A worker examined the floor beam, for example,
with a mirror only a little bigger than the one a dentist might
use.
</P>
<P>
   N-1383 has been inspected and modified several times because of
the discovery of flaws in fuel tank wiring in other 737s, in
inspections brought on by the explosion of the TWA 747, Flight 800,
after it took off from Kennedy Airport in New York in July 1996. In
the recent maintenance visit, workers were checking the connections
that prevent static charges from building up in the tanks.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1994, a USAir 737 crashed near Pittsburgh, and
determining the cause took more than three years, partly because
the plane's flight data recorder had been an early model. N-1383
was getting an updated version.
</P>
<P>
   The new flight data recorder is a good example of the difference
between minimum requirements and what United considers good
maintenance. The original flight data recorder captured 16
categories of information; the FAA, after much debate, is requiring
22, but the one United is installing will capture 36.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft is also getting a computer, the ``enhanced ground
proximity warning system,'' that compares the plane's course to an
electronic map and warns against flying too low. That is a result
of the 1995 crash of an American Airlines plane in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   And the plane is getting a new weather radar that can detect
windshear, the sudden shift from a headwind to a tailwind, which is
the cause of many accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Forty of the 50 changes in the maintenance visit are voluntary,
most of them recommended by Boeing, others by United. For example,
an internal report on the reliability of its 737 fleet, made
available by the company, shows that part of the system for
measuring fuel quantity tends to show signs of wear between 31,000
and 34,000 flight hours. The problem has caused an average of one
flight cancellation every two months among the airline's 182 737s.
United will soon begin replacing the parts.
</P>
<P>
   From a bolt on a landing gear that tends to crack because of
corrosion, causing delays, to unreliable seals on a refrigerator in
the galley, the list of changes goes on and on.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But these are only the changes made in heavy maintenance. The
service report for the plane over the last month is a secession of
burned-out light bulbs or other small problems. The plane has six
wheels, and has had four tire replacements in the last month. One
tire was replaced twice.
</P>
<P>
   Over and over, maintenance officials say that safety is their
top priority. But it was clear that many of the changes would be
reliability problems long before they would be safety problems. For
example, United was doing preventive maintenance of tracks that
hold the plane's flaps in place, to prevent eventual vibrations
that have occurred on other planes.
</P>
<P>
   The engineering staff evaluates a constant flow of service
problems from the field, and ``service bulletins'' from Boeing
recommending changes, as well as from the manufacturers of the
engines and other components. On a plane like the 737, the service
bulletins can reach 1,000 a year. Airlines like United will take
action on most of the recommendations. The aviation agency will
focus on a handful and make them mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   United's aim is to complete action on the suggestions in the
safety-related bulletins long before the agency mandates them,
which can take years. Sometimes this backfires.
</P>
<P>
   For example, after the National Transportation Safety Board said
that the USAir crash in Pittsburgh showed a problem with the
hydraulic unit in the rudder, United replaced the unit in its 737s
before the agency finished drafting its rule to require the change.
In the end, though, the agency mandated one test more than United
had accomplished, and the airline had to take the hydraulic units
off the plane a second time and put them to the additional test.
``We went out and tried to lead the industry, but then they came
out with another test,'' said Gregory Borsari, United's manager of
engineering for 737s.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Each change leads to a raft of other changes. Anything that adds
five pounds or more to the plane's weight goes into a database used
to recalculate its center of gravity, for example. (And planes,
like people, tend to get heavier as they age.) And any new system,
like the fire detection and suppression system, means a new
maintenance schedule.
</P>
<P>
   For N-1383, which United bought new from Boeing in March 1990,
this was heavy-maintenance visit No. 2, the second time it has been
torn apart and rebuilt. The process will include 20,148 hours of
mechanics' labor at a total labor cost of $420,000. Materials will
cost another $342,000.
</P>
<P>
   That is relatively cheap. By heavy-maintenance visit No. 7, when
the plane will be more than 30 years old, N-1383 will require
38,000 hours of labor, and the visit will cost about $3 million,
not counting modifications that have not yet been devised.
</P>
<P>
   The escalating cost of heavy maintenance may be what determines
how long the plane can economically be flown, said Mohr, the United
official. Ultimately it will be scrapped or sold to another
airline, probably in another part of the world, ``that doesn't have
the same standards,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>
A CENTURY OF CHANGE IS SHOWN BY THE NUMBERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BILL DEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1900, the typical American was a boy, not yet a teenager,
named John. He lived with his parents and his sisters, Mary and
Helen, on a farm in New York or Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   As the 20th century closes, the typical American is a young
woman, between 25 and 34, named Lisa. She lives in a California
suburb with her daughter, Emily, (these days, odds are no better
than 50-50 that mother and father live together with the children).
She is thinking of having another child, who will be called
Samantha or Michael.
</P>
<P>
   These portraits are drawn by the Statistical Abstract, which is
being released Monday. The annual compendium from the U.S. Census
Bureau is a motion picture, emphasizing America's changing face
over the past 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   Available in a book, on CD-ROM and on the Internet, its 1,447
tables of statistics should be enough to help schoolchildren with
their end-of-the-century homework assignments.
</P>
<P>
   John, the prototypical lad of 1900, did not have the Web, of
course. With an annual income of about $3,000 a year in today's
dollars, his family also had no indoor plumbing, no phone, and no
car. He probably would not finish high school.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa and little Emily end 1999 with a household income of
$45,000, enough for two cars and cable TV. Lisa has been to
college, of course.
</P>
<P>
   John's newest neighbors were from Austria-Hungary and Italy.
Lisa's children attend school with classmates from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   John could expect to live to age 46, if he escaped measles and
diphtheria. He might die of tuberculosis or the flu. Lisa can
expect to live into her 70s. She and her children are inoculated
against most preventable diseases, except AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the changes highlighted in the Statistical Abstract have
moved steadily through the century.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's population has nearly quadrupled (from 76 million
to an estimated 274 million today). More than 10 times as many
Americans are 65 or older.
</P>
<P>
   That population has moved from rural areas (60 percent) to urban
areas (75 percent). The nation that was 88 percent white is now
about 62 percent so and rapidly changing. Two cities that were in
the top 10 in population in 1900 are barely in the top 50: St.
Louis (was 4th, now 47th) and Buffalo (8th, now 54th).
</P>
<P>
   Life expectancy increased for men (up to 74 years from 46), but
even more for women (up to 79 from 48). The average household size
fell from 4.8 people to 2.6. The number of bachelor's degrees rose
from 29,000 in 1900 to a projected 1.2 million in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Although the number of foreign-born residents has increased
(growing to 25.8 million in 1997 from 10.3 million in 1900), a
higher percentage of the country is born in the United States (90
percent vs. 85 percent).
</P>
<P>
   ``To date, the 20th century has to be the most dynamic in our
history, and these statistics paint a picture of rapid and massive
change,'' said Kenneth Prewitt, director of the Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   The Statistical Abstract is on the Web at
http://www.census.gov/prod/www/statistical-abstract-us.html. It is
available from the National Technical Information Service ($34
softbound, $41 hardbound) by calling toll free, (800) 553-6847.
</P>
<P>
   The long view of the census bureau allows some changes that are
taken for granted to be studied in more detail. Everyone knows, for
example, that people get married older than they had.
</P>
<P>
   The median age of first marriage is now about 25 years for
women; back in 1900, it was only 22 years. For men, the change has
been less: 26 in 1900, nearly 27 now.
</P>
<P>
   But the change did not occur in a straight line. The age of
first marriage went down from 1900 until about 1956, when it
bottomed out at 22.5 for men and 20.1 for women. It has leveled off
in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest winners of the century may have been buy-and-hold
investors. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 composite stock index has

HOLYFIELD IS FIGHTER OF THE DECADE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In some ways, the 1990s were disappointing for
boxing.
</P>
<P>
   Most significantly, the decade failed to produce a fighter who
captured the public's imagination as Mike Tyson did in the '80s,
Ray Leonard did in the '70s and '80s and Muhammad Ali did in the
'60s and '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic gold-medal winner Oscar De La Hoya, a fine young fighter
with Leonard-like ability and charm, seemed to have what it takes
to fill the void but has failed to do so.
</P>
<P>
   And we'll never know how good Roy Jones Jr. is because no one
around is good enough to give him a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we were left with a faded Tyson as the sport's biggest
draw and wondering when the next great fighter might emerge.
</P>
<P>
   However, all was not lost.
</P>
<P>
   One fighter, special in his own way, did do us proud in the
'90s.
</P>
<P>
   No, Evander Holyfield doesn't have the ability or the charisma
of an Ali or Leonard or the mesmerizing punching power of a Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   What he did do was establish himself as the dominant champion in
the sport's marquee division as much as a result of grit and guts
as natural talent. And, while he did it quietly, he also did it
with was as much class as any of his predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   The fighter of the decade? No brainer: Holyfield's the man.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   1. Holyfield. He joined Ali as the only three-time heavyweight
champions and he did it all in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   He knocked out Buster Douglas in three rounds in 1990 to win the
title; lost it to Riddick Bowe in 1992; regained it from Bowe in
1993; lost it to Michael Moorer in 1994; and, in one of the
decade's most dramatic moments, knocked out Tyson in 11 rounds as a
huge underdog to become champ a third time.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield gave us so many memories.
</P>
<P>
   2. Pernell Whitaker: He won 17 world championship fights in the
'90s before he began to decline late in the decade. With Jones and
Julio Cesar Chavez, he's the greatest talent of his era.
</P>
<P>
   3. Jones: He easily outpointed much-feared James Tony with his
rare boxing skills to win the WBC super middleweight champion and
then graduated to the light heavyweight division, which he
dominates to this day.
</P>
<P>
   He's a great fighter without a great fight.
</P>
<P>
   4. Ricardo Lopez: He had owned the strawweight division since he
stopped Ohashi Hideyuki in October of 1990 and now is the junior
flyweight champ.
</P>
<P>
   However, he has had Jones' problem: Precious little competition.
</P>
<P>
   5. Oscar De La Hoya: He has had some fine moments, but his
career has been marked so far by inconsistency and
unpredictability.
</P>
<P>
   Is he a boxer? A puncher? Both? We're waiting for him to find
himself and realize his potential. Against Felix Trinidad, he had
an opportunity for a sensational, breakthrough victory but
squandered it by running the final few rounds.
</P>
<P>
   6. Trinidad: He won the IBF welterweight title in 1993 and still
holds it. That's a long, impressive run sullied only by a lack of
top-notch competition.
</P>
<P>
   He added the WBC welterwight belt by outpointing De La Hoya in a
fight he should've lost.
</P>
<P>
   7. Julio Cesar Chavez: We'll think of the '90s as the decade
that Chavez's skills faded. However, he won 15 title fights in
machine-like fashion between 1990 and 1996, the year he first lost
to De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, he was at his best in the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   8. Terry Norris: OK, he had the chin from you know where. At the
same time, he was a wonder to watch with his rare combination of
skills and power. He won 19 world title fights in the decade and
won't be forgotten. If he could've taken a punch, he would've been
one of the greatest.
</P>
<P>
   9. Riddick Bowe: His peak didn't last long but was impressive.
His two victories over a young Holyfield in three fights are the
reason he's here.
</P>
<P>
   10. Lennox Lewis: He has yet to give anything resembling a great
performance. However, this big, talented heavyweight has lost only
once _ a questionable stoppage against Oliver McCall _ and twice
beat Holyfield, once officially and once in reality.
</P>
<P>
   Others: Among others worthy of consideration: Johnny Tapia, who
was a dominating junior bantamweight; George Foreman, whose
knockout of Michael Moorer to win the heavyweight championship at
45 was one of the decade's most-thrilling moments; Humberto
``Chiquita'' Gonzalez, one of the '90s most exciting little men;
Azumah Nelson, one of the great fighters of his era; and Genearo
Hernandez, who had a quiet, but long run in the junior lightweight
division.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Mayweather, Fernando Vargas and David Reid? The talent is
there but the accomplishments aren't ... yet.
</P>
<P>
   Next week: In next Monday's boxing column, we'll rank the top-10
fighters of the century.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Mexican War: In terms of potential, it's tough to top the
scheduled bout between Erik Morales and Marco Antonio Barrera on
Feb. 19 in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Both fighters are big punchers with aggressive styles who will
be fighting for Morales' WBC junior featherweight title and hero
status in their native Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Morales, unbeaten, will be the favorite. He's one of the sport's
fastest-rising stars, while Barrera is still trying to come back
from losses to Junior Jones in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Morales is very confident. He called the matchup ``a transition
fight,'' meaning there are much bigger and better things ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Naseem Hamed, for example. Morales' face lights up when the
Prince's name is mentioned because of the money and recognition
that would come with a victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will be my biggest fight,'' Morales said through an
interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   Barrera was regarded as perhaps the next great Mexican champion
until the Jones fights, in which he was exposed as painfully
mortal.
</P>
<P>
   He took 10 months off to rebuild and has won six straight fights
since his return.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has the fire of old as he prepares to take on
Morales.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a lot from those losses,'' he said through an
interpreter. ``It helps me a lot for this fight. I was at a point
right before I fought Jones where I thought I was invincible, that
no one could touch me. The Jones fights put my feet on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put doubts in peoples' minds with the Jones fights. This
fight will bring me back to the top.''
</P>
<P>
   It's important to note that Morales stopped Jones in four rounds
in 1998. However, that might not be as significant as Morales seems
to think it is because Jones had taken a severe beating from
Kennedy McKinney before that fight, the kind of beating that takes
a lot out of a fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Morales-Hamed: Bob Arum, Morales' promoter, said he will not
jump into a bout with Hamed.
</P>
<P>
   The flamboyant Briton recently engaged in a bout with Cesar Soto
that resembled a wrestling match and Arum is hesitant to subject
his fighter to such a risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have to be confident something like that wouldn't
happen again,'' Arum said.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya-Trinidad: OK, hopefully they'll get it right this
time.
</P>
<P>
   Arum, De La Hoya's promoter, and Don King, Trinidad's promoter,
are scheduled to sit down today in New York and discuss a possible
rematch for June 17 in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Let's make the deal. Trinidad could make $15 million-plus, a
figure he couldn't approach against any other fighter. And De La
Hoya reportedly is eager to exact revenge for his controversial
loss in their first meeting.
</P>
<P>
   It makes sense in every way.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya is scheduled to fight Derrell Coley on Feb. 26 at
Madison Square Garden.

FORMER FRIENDS LEWINSKY AND TRIPP TO MEET IN COURT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JILL ABRAMSON and NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the first time since their fateful friendship
and taped conversations set off the investigation of a president,
Monica Lewinsky and Linda Tripp will confront each other, this time
in court.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky is on the witness list for a pretrial hearing,
scheduled to begin on Monday in Howard County, Md., where Mrs.
Tripp faces charges that she illegally taped their telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Mrs. Tripp, who had brought her secretly recorded
conversations with Ms. Lewinsky about Ms. Lewinsky's affair with
President Clinton to the attention of the independent counsel
Kenneth Starr, was indicted on two criminal charges by a Maryland
grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp's trial is scheduled to begin next month, but Judge
Diane Leasure granted her request for a pretrial hearing on whether
prosecutors had obtained evidence from statements Mrs. Tripp made
under a grant of immunity from prosecution from Starr's office.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's testimony is expected later this week, said her
lawyer, Plato Cacheris, although the exact date was uncertain. She
was put on the witness list by the Maryland prosecutor, Stephen
Montanarelli.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is not enthusiastic about going in and testifying about
this,'' Cacheris said. ``She would just as soon all these episodes
would subside and she could get on with the rest of her life.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky has not exchanged words with or seen Mrs. Tripp, in
whom she confided the details of her relationship with Clinton,
since the day in January 1998 that agents and prosecutors from
Starr's office swooped down on her.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp had invited Ms. Lewinsky to the Ritz Carlton Hotel
near the Pentagon, where both women once worked. That day, the last
words Ms. Lewinsky uttered to Mrs. Tripp, her one-time confidante,
were a sarcastic ``Thanks a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   And her feelings of betrayal were again captured when Ms.
Lewinsky completed her testimony on Aug. 20, 1998, before Starr's
grand jury by stating, ``And I hate Linda Tripp.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the tables have turned. While it was Ms. Lewinsky who was
once in legal jeopardy because of her affair with the president, it
is now Mrs. Tripp, who views herself as a courageous whistle-blower
who brought evidence of illegal behavior in the White House to
Starr's attention, who faces prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   (Besides Mrs. Tripp, only one figure in the investigation that
led to Clinton's impeachment by the House of Representatives and
subsequent acquittal in the Senate has faced criminal charges. She
is Julie Hiatt Steele, a peripheral figure in the Lewinsky
investigation who was indicted on federal fraud charges but not
convicted.)
</P>
<P>
   If convicted on criminal charges of willfully violating a state
law that prohibits the recording of telephone conversations without
the consent of the person being recorded, Mrs. Tripp faces a
maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky has begun to rebuild her life, granting interviews
to Barbara Walters of ABC News, who named her one of the ``most
fascinating'' people of the year, and hawking bags that she
designed on an Internet site, therealmonicainc.com. She also has a
business relationship with the Jenny Craig diet empire. But Mrs.
Tripp remains stressed and angry over the fact that she is the one
still enmeshed in legal trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a tremendous ordeal for her,'' said a friend,
Phillip Coughter, who is acting as her spokesman. ``Linda has no
doubt that this is a politically motivated prosecution. She
believes she is being punished for having stepped forward and
cooperated with the Office of the Independent Counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp's defenders have maintained that the Maryland state
charges against her were politically motivated and fueled by
Democratic allies of the White House in Maryland. Montanarelli has
denied that the case is political.
</P>
<P>
   The events leading to this week's hearing began when Mrs. Tripp
told Starr's prosecutors that she believed Clinton and his friend
Vernon Jordan had been coaching Ms. Lewinsky to perjure herself
about the affair. What's more, she said, she possessed recordings
of her telephone conversations with Ms. Lewinsky that provided
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those tapes are now at the heart of the criminal case
against Mrs. Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   She sought and received a promise of immunity from Starr's
deputy Jackie Bennett in 1998. The central issue at the hearing is
whether that immunity, given by a federal law-enforcement officer,
prevented Mrs. Tripp from being prosecuted in Maryland, which is
among a handful of states that make it a crime to knowingly tape
another person's conversation without that person's consent. Mrs.
Tripp made the recordings from her home in Columbia, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp is charged with one count of making a tape recording
of a conversation with Ms. Lewinsky on Dec. 22, after she had been
informed that it was illegal to do so in Maryland. She is also
charged with illegally turning that tape over to Michael Isikoff, a
Newsweek reporter. Each count carries a maximum penalty of five
years and a fine of $10,000 upon conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Asked last week how Mrs. Tripp felt about where events have
taken her, Coughter said that she thinks ``it is ironic that the
one person who can be shown to have been telling the truth from day
one is now the only person with an indictment hanging over her head
with the possibility of going to prison.''
</P>
<P>
   To pay her legal expenses, Mrs. Tripp's lawyers established a
legal defense fund over a year ago. Coughter said that the fund,
whose donors do not have to be disclosed, has received donations
from more than 50,000 people. He said its total revenue was less
than $500,000, which has covered some but not all of her legal
bills.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the fund raising has been done by companies that
specialize in direct-mail solicitations using conservative-oriented
mailing lists. An advertisement for donations has appeared in The
Washington Times.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp's lawyer in the case, Joseph Murtha of Baltimore,
complained that the state of Maryland had been using ``practically
unlimited resources in pursuing Linda.''
</P>
<P>
   The state is expected to call several current and former members
of Starr's staff, as well as Ms. Lewinsky, in the criminal trial.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing is expected to last about a week and will focus on
whether the immunity given by Starr covers Mrs. Tripp in Maryland.
If the judge rules that it does not, Maryland prosecutors will
still have to show that they learned of Mrs. Tripp's activities
without having relied on information given to the federal
prosecutors under a grant of immunity.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Montanarelli, a special corruption prosecutor who has been
assigned the case, said he was prepared to show that his
investigators and his grand jury learned of Mrs. Tripp's activities
independently of Starr's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   If the state cannot demonstrate that, or if the judge rules that
the immunity conferred by Starr covers everything in Maryland, the
case will almost certainly be dismissed. Montanarelli acknowledged
in an interview that his case would be crippled in such an event.
</P>
<P>
   If Montanarelli prevails in the hearing, Mrs. Tripp's trial,
which is scheduled to begin Jan. 18, is almost certain to be
postponed until the spring.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her unsought role as defendant in Maryland, Mrs.
Tripp has cast herself in an entirely different light in a civil
suit she has filed in Washington. In that suit, in which she seeks
unspecified damages from two Pentagon employees and others, Mrs.
Tripp portrays herself as the principled martyr of the
Clinton-Lewinsky saga.
</P>
<P>
   Her lawyer in the civil suit, Stephen Kohn, said that Mrs.
Tripp's taping of Ms. Lewinsky was not an act of personal treachery
as many have charged. Rather, he said, she was obligated to do it
under venerable civil-rights statutes dating back to the end of the
Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Kohn, who has made a career of representing whistle-blowers,
said that Mrs. Tripp acted ``in the finest tradition'' of those
government employees who expose wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   He said that under the Civil Rights Act of 1871, Mrs. Tripp had
a duty to report that Ms. Lewinsky was having a sexual affair with
Clinton and had taken illegal steps to conceal it. In explaining
that proposition, Kohn asserted that it would have been a violation
of the civil rights of Paula Jones, who was suing Clinton for
sexual misconduct under civil-rights statutes, to have been denied
knowledge of the Lewinsky-Clinton relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knew in her heart and her head she had to disclose this,''
Kohn said, ``even if it meant taping.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohn said that in his meetings with Mrs. Tripp, it was clear
that she had been ``going through great turmoil.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see great distress in her eyes,'' he said.

METS ARE STILL SHOPPING AFTER ACQUIRING ZEILE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Shortly after 9 o'clock Saturday night, Todd
Zeile sat in his agent's hotel room and experienced an epiphany.
``I've got three years left, maybe four,'' Zeile said. ``Which team
do I have a better chance of winning a world championship with?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer, as it turned out, was simple. That's why Zeile
accepted the New York Mets' three-year, $20 million offer and left
the Texas Rangers stunned and wondering about their immediate
course.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Phillips, who engineered the Zeile coup, went back to work
Sunday in an effort to make sure Zeile will not regret his
decision. Ken Griffey Jr., Manny Ramirez, Jim Edmonds, B.J.
Surhoff, David Wells, Scott Erickson, Jason Schmidt, Francisco
Cordova. These were some of the players, hard-hitting outfielders
and starting pitchers, that Phillips, the Mets' general manager,
was talking about with other teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some larger deals we're still talking about,''
Phillips said without naming teams or players.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips was fresh off of signing Zeile, a free-agent third
baseman, to replace John Olerud at first base. He began pursuing
the 34-year-old Zeile the minute Olerud signed with Seattle last
week. But besides replacing the offensive production Olerud took
with him, Phillips wants to upgrade the Mets' offense, and that's
why he was talking to the Mariners about Griffey, to Cleveland
about Ramirez, to Anaheim about Edmonds and to Baltimore about
Surhoff.
</P>
<P>
   He also wants to add a strong starting pitcher; thus the talks
with Toronto about Wells, with the Orioles about Erickson and with
Pittsburgh about Schmidt and Cordova.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' general manager, Brian Cashman, isn't at the winter
meetings; no high-level member of the team's front office is. But
that hasn't stopped Cincinnati from pursuing Hideki Irabu, whom the
Yankees would like to trade. The Reds won't give up Dennys Reyes,
the young relief pitcher the Yankees would like, but Cincinnati is
offering prospects, and the Yankees may well make the trade.
</P>
<P>
   In one trade that was made Sunday, the Chicago Cubs became the
beneficiary of the Los Angeles Dodgers' desire to unload enough
salary to give them greater payroll flexibility. The Dodgers sent
Ismael Valdes, a starting pitcher, and Eric Young, a second baseman
and base-stealing leadoff hitter, to the Cubs for Terry Adams, a
reliever; Chad Ricketts, a minor-league reliever; and a player to
be named.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey and Ramirez presented the most intriguing possibilities
for the Mets, who don't have a problem with payroll flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' contingent of trade talkers had not held their daily
meeting with the Mariners when Phillips briefed reporters with
sparse details of what he had been up to. But when they met
Saturday, the Mariners finally began mentioning names. They didn't
tell the Mets the specific players they wanted, one of the meeting
participants said, but ran down a list of ``a bunch'' of players.
</P>
<P>
   Among the players the Mariners asked about were Armando Benitez,
Roger Cedeno, Octavio Dotel, Masato Yoshii and Dennis Cook.
``There's more potential there today than yesterday,'' the
participant said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the Mariners did not ask about Edgardo Alfonzo,
the Mets' outstanding second baseman. The Mariners' talks with the
Reds collapsed over Seattle's insistence on getting second baseman
Pokey Reese in a package for Griffey and the Reds' refusal to
include him.
</P>
<P>
   Like Griffey, Ramirez can be a free agent after next season.
John Hart, the Indians' general manager, said he met with Phillips
on Saturday morning but declined to name the names they discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that there's anything there,'' Hart said.
``There's been a lot of people talked about. We haven't got to the
point where we've entertained anything on the trade front.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Moorad, Ramirez's agent, said the former Washington Heights
resident prefers to remain in Cleveland. ``We made that point clear
to John Hart,'' Moorad said. But if the Indians decided they didn't
want to pay what a contract extension would cost (presumably more
than $15 million a year), he added, ``either New York team would
make sense to explore.''
</P>
<P>
   Moorad, who negotiated a $14 million-a-year contract for Shawn
Green with the Dodgers last month, said he was not certain if he
would be willing to negotiate with a team the Indians might trade
Ramirez to before the deal would become final.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels want to trade an outfielder, preferably Edmonds or
Garret Anderson, and they met with the Mets Sunday, but the session
was brief and unproductive.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' talks with the Blue Jays, on the other hand, have at
least produced an offer. ``We made them a proposal, a multiplayer
deal on both sides,'' Gord Ash, the Toronto general manager, said.
</P>
<P>
   Wells, whom the teams discussed last month at the general
managers' meetings, would be at the center of such a trade. The
Blue Jays, like every team that talks to the Mets, are believed to
have asked for Dotel in return.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' talks with the Orioles had not reached the offer
stage. But the Mets expressed interest in Erickson, a veteran
right-handed starter, who overcame a poor start last season and
finished with a 15-12 record. They also asked about Surhoff, a good
left-handed-hitting outfielder. The Mets want to find a left-hander
to replace Olerud's bat.

   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Ray Lucas was on the ground, so groggy
he had to be helped to the sideline with the score tied at 13-13 in
the final quarter against the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   No problem. Lucas left for a play, Rick Mirer came in for a
handoff and suddenly Lucas was back on the field after Bill
Parcells had quizzed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know how to execute this play?'' Parcells asked. Lucas
explained it to his coach.
</P>
<P>
   And then on his first play back after getting leveled on a
helmet-to-helmet hit, Lucas rolled right, found Keyshawn Johnson in
the end zone to his left and drilled a difficult 24-yard touchdown
pass to break the tie and send the Jets on their way to a 28-20
victory Sunday. As for the Dolphins, now 8-5, it dealt a powerful
blow to their playoff hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' a satisfied Johnson said later, ``was an Elway kind of
throw.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also a Dan Marino kind of fourth-quarter comeback. But
this time, for a change, it wasn't Marino. Instead, the 38-year-old
quarterback was on the sideline as the game wound down, and for all
anyone knew it could have been his last appearance in Giants
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets, though, remain alive to the possibility of finishing
the season at 8-8. They have five victories with three games
remaining, and in the most extreme case, they could make the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   First they had to win a game. This they did to snap a two-game
losing streak and avoid being the first Jets team in the three-year
Parcells reign to lose three in a row.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't easy, but for the fans on hand it was fun. After all,
John Hall missed a pair of extra-point attempts _ the first time a
kicker has done that since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   And the Jets needed some final-period theatrics. Just last
Sunday, Lucas had sprained his ankle against the Giants in the
final period, and Parcells wanted to keep him out. Lucas grabbed
his coach by the arm and insisted on returning. He threw two
touchdowns in a losing effort. Sunday he repeated the
fourth-quarter scoring, but with different results.
</P>
<P>
   After Aaron Glenn intercepted Marino with the score 13-6 toward
the end of the third quarter, the Jets began a drive that ended
with the first of two Lucas-to-Johnson touchdowns. The two
collaborated on a 26-yarder to tie the score, and then connected
for the dramatic second score.
</P>
<P>
   That final catch gave Johnson a career-high 11-reception game,
following his 10-catch effort against the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   After John Hall missed the extra point to leave the score at
19-13, the Jets added a 46-yard Hall field goal. Then safety Omar
Stoutmire produced the crushing play _ he intercepted Marino and
returned the ball for a 67-yard touchdown. Stoutmire, who obviously
will see more action the rest of the season, had replaced Steve
Atwater, who may miss the rest of the year with a pulled hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   With Marino on the bench, Damon Huard led a final Miami
touchdown drive in the closing seconds. But the Jets then recovered
the onside kick. And this game belonged to a quarterback who had
said he would be thrilled just to be on the same field as Marino. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The game was lacking in theatrics at halftime, each team having
kicked two field goals, but Lucas came out looking for the big play
in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The first time the Jets touched the ball, on the opening
kickoff, Dwight Stone returned it 45 yards. Then Lucas, on the
first play from scrimmage, whipped the ball 45 yards in the air
over the middle, looking for Wayne Chrebet.
</P>
<P>
   The pass was overthrown _ indeed, Lucas came into the game
having completed only one pass that actually traveled at least 20
yards in the air.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets continued to try to make the big play when they went
for it on fourth-and-1 from the Miami 46. It was an odd thing to do
on the opening drive, but then again, the Jets were running out of
opportunities this season. Martin converted.
</P>
<P>
   However, the drive ended in failure when Hall missed a 47-yard
field goal attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Marino, though, completed his first six passes, getting the
Dolphins close enough for a 24-yard Olino Mare field goal and a 3-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   This has been a season in which the smallest setback hurts the
Jets, who do not have the resiliency on offense to offset a
problem. Until Sunday, they had kept most of their games manageable
by avoiding turnovers. They had in fact gone three straight games
without one, and had not lost a fumble since Game 6, against the
Colts.
</P>
<P>
   But on the kickoff following Miami's field goal, Stone fumbled,
the Dolphins recovered only 23 yards away from the Jets' goal line,
and Mare converted the lost ball into a 33-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets tied the score with a pair of field goals in the second
quarter, each time helped by good field position. First, Lucas took
over on the Dolphins' 36, could not get the team into the end zone,
but did see Hall boot a 28-yarder. Then the Jets took over on the
Miami 33 and got close enough for a 31-yard kick.
</P>
<P>
   Again, though, the Jets gave up the sort of play they cannot
afford: Nate Jacquet produced the longest punt return of the season
against them, and it positioned the Dolphins only 25 yards out.
Five plays later, Stanley Pritchett smacked over from the 1 for a
13-6 lead.
</P>
<P>
   As they have been all season, the Jets were depleted Sunday _
this time on defense. Ray Mickens, their nickel back, sat out with
a hamstring injury. Jason Wiltz, who was becoming effective in the
rotation on the defensive line, also was sidelined, with a turf-toe
injury.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets finally got a big play of their own toward the end of
the third period, when Glenn produced his third interception of the
season to put the Jets at the Miami 39.
</P>
<P>
   This time the Jets did something with their break. Johnson took
a 26-yard Lucas pass a few seconds into the the final quarter and
easily outhustled safety Shawn Wooden into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   The score lifted Johnson over the 1,000-yard receiving mark for
a second straight year. That had not happened since George Sauer
and Don Maynard each did it in 1967 and 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson followed that with his 24-yard end-zone grab on Lucas'
theatrical return with 5 minutes 26 seconds left, but the Jets
still kept the fans in their seats as Hall's extra-point attempt
hit the top of the left upright and bounced the wrong way. &QL;

ASIAN-AMERICAN GROUPS JOIN IN OUTRAGE OVER SCIENTIST'S INDICTMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (mk) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ More than a dozen Asian-American organizations
have discussed the formation of an ad hoc coalition to speak out on
behalf of the scientist indicted on charges of mishandling nuclear
weapons secrets, fearing that he has been unfairly singled out
because he is of Chinese descent.
</P>
<P>
   Various Asian-American groups, ranging from the National Asian
Pacific American Bar Association to the Chinese Physics Association
and the Asian American Manufacturers Association, continued
discussions Sunday after holding a three-hour telephone conference
following the arrest of Wen Ho Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Many Asian-Americans said a growing sense of outrage over the
way Lee had been arrested had served as a catalyst for several of
the groups. Many of the groups have shunned political involvement
in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who is being held without bond in New Mexico pending a
court hearing on Monday, was indicted on Friday on charges that he
had improperly removed American nuclear secrets from the Los Alamos
National Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to support him morally and monetarily,'' said Bill
Chang, president of the Chinese-American Engineers and Scientists
Association of Southern California, which has more than a thousand
members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying he's not a criminal, but that this has to be
proved beyond a reasonable doubt and the process has to be fair,''
Chang said. ``From what I've seen so far, this looks like prejudice
and overkill.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never done anything like this before, but I've been
getting a lot of calls from our members,'' Chang said. ``They're
very scared and angry. They're really upset about what this means
for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Tang, the chairman of the Committee of 100, an
organization of prominent Chinese-Americans and a leader of the
nascent coalition, also said that the issue was not innocence or
guilt, but a battle against racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, this man is a nuclear scientist,'' Tang said. ``He
was being given worse, shabbier treatment than a drug dealer.''
</P>
<P>
   Tang said that the coalition's plans were not certain yet, but
that for now, it would be analyzing the legal case, would raise
money for Lee's defense and expected to speak out against any
instances where there appeared to be unfair treatment.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Lee's lawyer called the charges ``groundless,'' but
prosecutors called the security breaches significant threats to
American security. The charges could bring a sentence of life in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Asian-American groups say they are concerned
that, in spite of a long investigation, Lee was charged with
transferring highly sensitive nuclear weapons data from secure
computers, but was not charged with espionage. Lee has previously
denied that he was a spy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the indictment, this looks like 59 counts of
downloading,'' Tang said. ``The catch-all phrase here is he looks
like a scapegoat. This has brought a lot of different forces
together, people who have not spoken much before. Catalyst is the
right word.''
</P>
<P>
   Several people wondered why, if such security violations were
common, as Lee had maintained earlier, he was singled out for
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm deeply suspicious of the way they went about this,'' said
Tina Hsu, a lawyer in Washington who is Chinese-American. ``He's
not even charged with spying. He's been charged with mishandling
information. He seems like a sacrificial lamb.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not have a problem if they came up with hard facts of
espionage. That's wrong and I wouldn't defend him just because he's
Asian-American,'' Ms Hsu said. ``But I'm suspicious that after all
these investigations all they could prove was mishandling the
information.''
</P>
<P>
   Victor Hwang, a lawyer here who previously worked at the
Democratic National Committee, said, ``I liken this to racial
profiling. It's the same thing. If people think this has upset just
the political activists and not the mainstream of Asian-Americans,
they're wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When Lee was dismissed from his job at Los Alamos in March, and
was cited in news reports as a suspected spy for China, many
Asian-Americans said they became worried that he had fallen under
suspicion because of his race and not because of substantial
evidence. As a native of Taiwan, Lee would be expected to oppose
the communist regime in Beijing, members of the coalition said.
</P>
<P>
   Anger in the United States toward China and its repressive
government, members of the coalition said, has fueled unwarranted
suspicions of Asian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's arrest on Friday, which meant that he had to spend the
weekend in jail before getting a bail hearing, and the fact that
the 59-count indictment included no charges of espionage, has only
heightened those fears.
</P>
<P>
   Several said that Asian-American scientists and academics had
been expressing worries that their career prospects had been
damaged by the case because of unwarranted questions about their
loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spoken with three or four people personally who feel
their career chances have been damaged, and I've heard of a number
of other such reports,'' said Stewart Kwoh, the executive director
of the Asian Pacific American Legal Center of Southern California.
``We're worried this might be a case of selective prosecution. Our
question is if other people committed the same kind of
violations.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``People are tired of the sense that they are looked
at as permanent foreigners.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the responses to Lee's arrest were strikingly emotional.
</P>
<P>
   Cecilia Chang, a friend of Lee and his family, cried as she
asked how a country that stood for freedom and fairness could
prosecute a man who, she said, was a simple family man devoted to
his adopted country. Ms. Chang has helped put together a legal
defense fund and, she said, it has raised $11,000 in the last
several months.
</P>
<P>
   Several Asian-Americans said that the episode merely brought to
a head four years of growing anger at the way they were being
treated and portrayed in the media.
</P>
<P>
   The concern began in the last presidential campaign, when
several fund raisers of Asian descent pleaded guilty to charges
that they had arranged or made illegal contributions to President
Clinton's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Once those instances surfaced, the Democratic Party as well as
the FBI began to question many Asian-Americans about their
contributions, stirring anger that they had fallen under suspicion
merely because of their last names.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as catalysts go, I think we're up to our neck in
catalysts,'' Hwang said. ``People are angry. There's a big push
going on for more political involvement, and I think it's
working.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why several people said the discussions about forming a
coalition among the Asian-American groups this weekend were so
important.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not just Wen Ho Lee on the agenda,'' Tang said. ``It
was the overall impact this is having on the Asian-American
community.''
</P>
<P>
   While Lee's arrest was the culmination of an FBI investigation
into his computer activities that began in March, the espionage
inquiry that first brought Lee to the government's attention is
continuing at a much slower pace.
</P>
<P>
   The government stumbled onto evidence of Lee's unauthorized
computer transfers because he was under investigation in connection
with an inquiry into evidence that China may have stolen secret
data related to America's most advanced nuclear warhead, the W-88,
which was designed at Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   That investigation began in early 1995. By 1996, when the FBI
opened a formal criminal investigation, Lee had emerged as a
suspect.

PRINCETON SHEDS ITS OLD IMAGE WHILE PUSHING RUTGERS AROUND 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By RON DICKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PISCATAWAY, N.J. _ Meet the new Princeton Tigers. They push the
ball straight inside. When they are shoved underneath, they shove
back. And they now press. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers got newly acquainted Sunday with the
rougher-around-the-edges Ivy Leaguers in their 105th meeting,
falling by 66-60 in overtime. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mason Rocca, the last link to Princeton's talented team of two
seasons ago, is now the flagship of the renovated Tigers. The
6-foot-9-inch Rocca has muscles that he is not afraid to use, a
quick first step, and a sweet version of a hook shot. The
combination added up to 28 points and 13 rebounds. Most of his
damage came in the first 32 minutes, when the Scarlet Knights
rotated single defenders on him. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They were making me make the shot,'' said Rocca, who missed
the Tigers' first four games with a groin pull. ``I like that.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And when Rutgers (6-2) stopped Rocca's scoring for the last 13
minutes with a double-team, Princeton (5-4) resorted to the other
advantages that had kept it ahead for most of the time in a
physical game abetted by a loud throng of 8,012 at Louis Brown
Athletic Center. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers worked for better shots, making 49 percent to
Rutgers' 36 percent, and squirmed their way to the foul line more,
making 20 of 33 free throws, compared with Rutgers' 9 of 19. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we played at a particularly high level,''
Rutgers Coach Kevin Bannon said. ``I was kind of shocked. We
weren't sharp offensively.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If not for Dahntay Jones' 27 points, Rutgers would not have made
a game of it with an 8-2 spurt to take a 51-49 lead with 1 minute
25 seconds to go in regulation. At that point, Rocca took on the
role of playmaker, flipping a backdoor pass to Nate Walton, who
made a layup to tie the score at 51-51. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That was one of the few backdoor scores for Princeton. Without
the offensive firepower of a few years ago, Coach Bill Carmody has
eliminated a lot of the team's cuts to the basket. He is also
dabbling with a press, which was largely responsible for 21 Scarlet
Knight turnovers. Princeton had 22 of its own, Rocca coughing up 7
of them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Scarlet Knights had the ball with 14.5 seconds to go in
regulation and could work only for a Jeff Greer fadeaway that fell
short at the buzzer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers briefly took the lead in overtime on a driving layup by
Jones, but Princeton answered with a 9-1 surge. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Players and coaches did not trumpet the full resurgence of this
once important rivalry, but Sunday afternoon's emotional affair was
something to build on. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't need to look at a stat sheet to know that it was a
very intense game,'' Carmody said. &QL;

EDITORIAL: BRINGING TURKEY INTO EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Dec. 13:
</P>
<P>
   The European Union's offer to accept Turkey as a future member
is one of those developments that mark a historic step beyond
restrictive old rivalries and power alignments.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing the potential of the moment, Turkey's leaders have
accepted the offer, despite misgivings about diplomatic
requirements attached to the invitation and the difficulty of
democratic reforms expected by the E.U. Joining the E.U. can
provide the chance Turkish governments have sought for years, with
strong backing from Washington, to assure their strategically
located country's full integration into the democratic West.
</P>
<P>
   The timetable for membership may be lengthened somewhat by the
E.U.'s conditions on economics, human rights and regional
relationships. Ankara is particularly sensitive to demands that it
resolve territorial disputes with Greece in the Aegean, submitting
them to the International Court of Justice in The Hague if
necessary. But the E.U. could not be expected to admit a country
that had unresolved border disputes with a member state.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey is also concerned about the E.U.'s decision that the
ethnic Greek government in divided Cyprus might someday be admitted
without the Turkish part of the island. E.U. members like Britain,
however, can be expected to protect the interests of Cyprus'
Turkish minority in any future accession deal.
</P>
<P>
   Some Turks are also uneasy because their country will now be
expected to conform to strict European human rights standards. But
this, like the other conditions, imposes no unfair or
discriminatory burden on Turkey. The same standards would be
imposed on any candidate for E.U. membership.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, E.U. membership is favored by the most
democratic elements in Turkish society. They expect closer formal
ties with the union to have positive effects on Turkish law and
political life, which remains heavily influenced by the military.
</P>
<P>
   The expected reforms include a widening of personal and
political freedoms, the elimination of torture and capital
punishment and the promotion of political, rather than military,
solutions to problems affecting the Kurdish minority. Opponents
include nationalists opposed to any compromise on the Aegean or
Cyprus, business leaders whose financial practices might not stand
up to European scrutiny and banking regulations, and defenders of
the traditional repressive approach to Kurdish affairs.
</P>
<P>
   For two millenniums and more the territory comprising modern
Turkey has been a vital geographic bridge connecting Europe, Asia
and the Middle East. It has been crossed by Alexander's legions,
early Christian evangelists, the medieval Ottoman conquerors of
Balkan Europe, NATO forces containing the former Soviet Union, and
today by American pilots patrolling Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey, already a NATO member, plays a critical role in
protecting American security interests in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for decades the European Union denied serious consideration
to Turkey's bid for membership. Legitimate misgivings about human
rights abuses, thinly disguised prejudices against the Muslim faith
of most Turks and narrowly nationalist objections from Greece,
Turkey's regional rival, combined to keep Ankara outside Europe's
most important economic and political organization.
</P>
<P>
   With Europe at last ready to welcome Turkey, Ankara could not
afford to walk away.

FEW SEEK TO TREAT MENTAL DISORDERS, NEW U.S. STUDY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Exclusive) 
(jw) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One in every five Americans experiences a mental
disorder in any given year, and half of all Americans have such
disorders at some time in their lives, but most of them never seek
treatment, the surgeon general of the United States says in a
comprehensive new report.
</P>
<P>
   Many people with mental disorders do not realize that effective
treatments exist, or they fear discrimination because of the stigma
attached to mental illness, the study found. And, it said, many
people cannot afford treatment because they lack insurance that
would cover it.
</P>
<P>
   After reviewing hundreds of studies, the report concludes that
``a range of effective treatments exist for nearly all mental
disorders,'' including the most severe. The report's principal
recommendation is to ``seek help if you experience symptoms of
mental illness.''
</P>
<P>
   The report is to be issued at the White House on Monday by the
surgeon general, Dr. David Satcher, the government's leading
spokesman on matters of public health.
</P>
<P>
   Satcher's report finds a huge gap between the need for mental
health services and their availability.
</P>
<P>
   One of the report's major themes is that mental health must be
part of mainstream health care, not an afterthought or an offshoot.
</P>
<P>
   The report says that ``22 percent of the population has a
diagnosable mental disorder,'' and that ``mental illness, including
suicide, is the second leading cause of disability,'' after heart
disease.
</P>
<P>
   But, it says, ``nearly two-thirds of all people with diagnosable
mental disorders do not seek treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   The statistics, derived from studies published in the last few
years, will probably not surprise psychiatrists, psychologists or
other specialists in mental health. But the report is significant
because it meticulously analyzes huge amounts of data and puts the
imprimatur of the government on the findings, just as the surgeon
general's report on smoking and health did in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Mental disorders are defined in the report as health conditions
marked by alterations in thinking, mood or behavior that cause
distress or impair a person's ability to function. They include
Alzheimer's disease, depression, attention-deficit or hyperactivity
disorder and phobias.
</P>
<P>
   The report says people are deterred from seeking treatment for
mental disorders because they have no health insurance, their
insurance does not adequately cover the costs or they have an
``unwarranted sense of hopelessness'' about the prospects for
recovery from mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   The document declares that ``mental disorders are not character
flaws, but are legitimate illnesses that respond to specific
treatments.'' It says that the ``cruel and unfair stigma attached
to mental illness'' is ``inexcusably outmoded'' and must no longer
be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is the stigma so strong despite better public
understanding of mental illness?'' the report asks. ``The answer
appears to be fear of violence. People with mental illness,
especially those with psychosis, are perceived to be more violent
than in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   While research suggests that some people with mental disorders
and drug abuse problems do indeed pose a risk of violence, the
report says, the danger is not great. ``In fact,'' it says, ``there
is very little risk of violence or harm to a stranger from casual
contact with an individual who has a mental disorder.''
</P>
<P>
   In issuing the report, federal officials said, the Clinton
administration will emphasize its efforts to fight mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   Copies of the report and related documents were obtained Sunday
from three sources: a civil servant who fears that the scientific
significance of the report may be overshadowed by its ``political
manipulation,'' consumer advocates who advised the government on
the study and mental health experts close to the office of Tipper
Gore. Over the last two decades, Mrs. Gore, the wife of Vice
President Al Gore, has been a champion for the rights of people
with mental illness, and she was once treated for depression
herself..
</P>
<P>
   Michael Faenza, president of the National Mental Health
Association, who served as a member of the planning board for the
report, said: ``This is a historic day. It's wonderful that we have
a surgeon general talking about mental health and mental illness,
in a voice that has not been used in Washington before.''
</P>
<P>
   Faenza said the report could be a turning point, if it improved
access to services, or ``it could be meaningless, if Congress and
state legislators do not have the backbone and the political will
to act on it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The report endorses efforts by some states and members of
Congress to eliminate the disparities in insurance coverage for
mental disorders and other illnesses. Equality between mental
health coverage and insurance for other illnesses _ a concept known
as parity _ is ``an affordable and effective objective,'' it says.
When mental health care is properly coordinated by a health
maintenance organization or a firm specializing in such care,
parity causes ``negligible cost increases,'' it says.
</P>
<P>
   But, the study says, techniques used by HMOs to cut costs, by
reducing hospital stays and encouraging short-term outpatient
therapy, have not worked well for emotionally disturbed children
from low-income families on Medicaid. Indeed, it says, Medicaid may
be simply shifting costs to child welfare and juvenile justice
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Among other recommendations, the study says ``it is imperative
to expand the supply'' of mental health services, and to increase
the number of mental health professionals caring for children and
adolescents. The study does not specify the cost of such
initiatives, but health officials said the administration was not
seeking a big budget increase.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have made immense gains in the treatment of mental
disorders, with powerful new drugs and various methods of
psychotherapy, but they need to focus more on how to prevent such
illnesses, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Progress in preventing mental illness has been slow, because
scientists do not understand enough about the causes of such
illness, the report said. Mental disorders are usually not defined
by laboratory tests or physiologic abnormalities of the brain, and
``for the most part, their causes remain unknown,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   The split between mind and body, proposed by Descartes in the
17th century, is artificial and antiquated and has hampered mental
health research, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The roots of most mental disorders lie in some combination of
biological and environmental factors,'' the report says. ``No
single gene appears to be responsible for any mental disorder.
Rather, small variations in multiple genes contribute to a
disruption in healthy brain function.'' Under certain environmental
conditions, it says, this disruption can result in mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   The report says ``the mental health system is highly
fragmented,'' so that people who need help must often navigate a
bewildering maze to get treatment. Moreover, it says, health care
practitioners are often unaware of research identifying the most
effective treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeon general's report also makes these points:
</P>
<P>
   --Psychiatric disorders appear in all types of families, of all
social classes and of all backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   --Treatment of mental disorders cost $69 billion in 1996, the
last year for which figures are available. In addition, the nation
spent $17.7 billion on Alzheimer's disease and $12.6 billion on
treatment for drug and alcohol abuse that year. The figures do not
include indirect costs, like days of work lost because of mental
illness.
</P>
<P>
   --One in five children experiences the signs and symptoms of a
diagnosable mental disorder in the course of a year, but only about
5 percent of all children suffer ``extreme functional impairment.''
</P>
<P>
   --Among Americans ages 18 to 54, the report said, 14.9 have
anxiety disorders, 7.1 percent have mood disorders and 1.3 percent
have schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   --Among elderly people, depression takes an ``inordinate toll,''
but often goes undiagnosed and untreated. Eight percent to 15
percent of older people living in the community have symptoms of
depression. ``Suicidal thoughts are sometimes considered a normal
facet of old age.'' People 65 and older have the highest suicide
rates of any age group.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the report says that Alzheimer's disease strikes 8
percent to 15 percent of people over the age of 65. But it insists
that ``normal aging is not characterized by mental disorders.''

EDITORIAL: DRUG TREATMENT GETS A BOOST 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Dec. 13:
</P>
<P>
   The beginning of an important shift in the nation's approach to
combating drug-related crime can be seen in the recent success of
``drug courts'' and other programs aimed at reducing prison costs
by diverting nonviolent drug users into serious drug treatment
programs. Making more resources available at every level of
government to expand these efforts would be a smart fiscal and
crime-fighting strategy.
</P>
<P>
   That was essentially the message the White House's director of
national drug policy, Gen. Barry McCaffrey, tried to convey last
week when he spoke before a gathering of law-enforcement, prison
and public health officials in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   As the nation's drug czar, McCaffrey has long been an outspoken
supporter of using alternatives to incarceration for nonviolent
drug offenders, and of making treatment more broadly available to
drug-dependent offenders when they are behind bars and after they
are released.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, his new remarks were heartening in that they seemed
to signal a renewed push by the Clinton administration to persuade
state and local officials to plow more money and energy into drug
treatment for people whose addiction leads them into collision with
the criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 1.8 million people now in prison nationwide, a large
percentage _ 400,000 altogether _ are addicts or chronic drug
users. Yet, as McCaffrey noted, ``incarcerating offenders without
treating underlying substance-abuse problems simply defers the time
when they are released back into our communities to start harming
themselves and the larger society.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to research showing that the recidivism rate declines
significantly among those who undergo treatment before, during or
following incarceration _ powerful evidence that drug treatment
works, even when it is imposed upon prisoners in custody, or as a
condition of avoiding jail.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence also bears out McCaffrey's claim that a move away
from policies that automatically jail drug offenders would save
taxpayers money. By instituting a program to divert low-level drug
offenders into treatment, Birmingham, Ala., has been able to avoid
the sizable expense of building a new jail to relieve overcrowding
at the old one.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona, the first state to begin treating all its nonviolent
drug offenders instead of locking them up, estimates that it saved
more than $2.5 million in the program's first fiscal year of
operation. No less impressive, more than three-quarters of those on
probation stayed free of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   This is clearly a promising approach to a serious national
problem, and McCaffrey is right to promote it.

PROGRESS IN N.Y. TRANSIT NEGOTIATIONS AS STRIKE DEADLINE NEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Negotiators for the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority and the union representing 33,000 New York City transit
workers said Sunday that they had narrowed their differences over a
proposed wage increase, the biggest issue dividing the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   With a strike deadline set for 12:01 a.m. Wednesday, officials
involved in the negotiations said that Willie James, president of
Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union, had scaled back his
demand for a 27 percent wage increase over three years.
</P>
<P>
   These officials said that negotiators for the MTA, which runs
the city's subways and buses, have raised their wage offer to above
the 12 percent over four years they offered last week. The MTA's
previous proposal included a wage increase of about 9.5 percent
over four years and increased pension contributions equal to 2.3
percent of each worker's salary. ``Both sides have made a move on
wages,'' said Marc Shaw, the MTA's executive director, who declined
to spell out the latest proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw said that the negotiations gained momentum on Friday night
and Saturday morning, when the two sides altered their wage
proposals. While slow progress had been taking place in other
areas, the deadlock over wages was hurting the tenor of the talks
and their overall momentum, negotiators said.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing both sides' new flexibility on wages, Shaw said: ``It
had the effect of allowing a lot of discussions to become much more
fruitful. The amount of movement on wages wasn't that significant,
but the fact that there was movement was significant. So long as
there is movement toward a center, we're comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   The two sides resumed negotiations at about noon Sunday at MTA
headquarters, a block from Grand Central Terminal. Later in the
day, they moved the talks to the Grand Hyatt Hotel, where they plan
to sequester themselves for continuous talks until the Wednesday
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Sunday night during a break in the negotiations,
Shaw said he was more optimistic about a settlement being reached
than he had been a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm moderately more optimistic, because movement is
continuing,'' he said. ``The progress that happened yesterday
continued, and we'll be going over a list of what the outstanding
issues are. Tonight, we'll start to move to close them.''
</P>
<P>
   But he voiced concern that some serious snags could still
develop that would slow or halt momentum toward a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Frank, a union spokesman, said, ``Things are moving
along.'' He would not be more specific.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials said they expected the MTA to raise its offer to
match the 13 percent over four years that most unions at the Long
Island Rail Road and Metro-North Railroad have accepted. A big
question, many labor experts say, is whether the MTA will raise its
offer above that 13 percent, a move that might anger the railroad
unions.
</P>
<P>
   James insists that his members deserve more than the railway
workers because his union made several significant concessions to
the MTA in its current contract, which expires on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   James has been under heavy pressure from his members and from a
large dissident faction to obtain well more than 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Schermerhorn, who narrowly lost to James in an election last
year and who heads the New Directions dissident group, said in an
interview that James should secure raises of 7 percent or 8 percent
a year _ figures that MTA officials say would cause a large
deficit.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Carlos Rogers had waited years for his chance, and now he had it.
He had been doomed to persona non grata status by the Trail
Blazers, offered little more than relative cameos by the Warriors
and Raptors. But now he was starting, sent to fill the huge void
left by Charles Barkley's injury. He was playing well, and he knew
it.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But in another agonizing irony in a season filled with them,
playing time meant nothing to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Minutes don't mean anything if you're losing,'' Rogers said.
``That doesn't matter. If you win with 10 minutes, you did a great
job. If you lose and play 48 minutes, it doesn't mean (anything).''
</P>
<P>
   The circumstances of the Rockets' three consecutive defeats
would not be considered, he said. The Rockets dismissed the
obvious, handy explanations for their ``funk.''
</P>
<P>
   Emotions could have been considered as torn as the Rockets'
preseason blueprint. There had been no time to regroup. No team had
suffered through more calamities, and by the time the Rockets hit
New Jersey on Saturday for their third short-handed game in four
nights, they were road-weary and emotionally spent.
</P>
<P>
   But they would buy none of it. They could have understandably
explained away the 106-94 loss to the Nets as an aberration, but
they refused.
</P>
<P>
   Getting beaten by the Nets might not have been so humbling had
the Rockets blamed their continued misfortune. Calling on the
excuses so readily available might have softened the blow.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they said they knew they would have to win without
their veteran stars eventually. They would not pretend that losing
Barkley and Hakeem Olajuwon prevented them from playing with
intensity or working defensively. They knew that if they blamed
their personnel losses for their defeats now, they might also be
accepting of defeat later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them I'm going to coach to win, coach these guys
hard,'' coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. ``If I didn't, it would be a
wasted year. You've got to get something positive out of it. It
really just speeds up the process we were going to have to go
through at the beginning of (next) year when we wouldn't have had
Charles.''
</P>
<P>
   The process, however, has not really had time to begin. The
Rockets have had one practice since Barkley's career-ending rupture
of his quadriceps tendon, and the workout was tempered because it
came on the one day of the four-day trip without a game.
</P>
<P>
   After taking Sunday off, the Rockets will get a full practice in
today. But they go from facing a team that views spring as lottery
season to the teams that last spring played for the NBA
championship, battling the Knicks on Tuesday and the Spurs on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had enough time to prepare for it,'' Shandon
Anderson said of the alterations in style that constant roster
changes bring. ``With all the new guys, we have to still learn the
system a little bit. Having that post game to rely on isn't there.
We have to get up and down, more setting picks, getting guys open.
But there hasn't been enough time yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets were seemingly starting to mature past their
early-season growing pains, winning three straight before Barkley
went down.
</P>
<P>
   With Olajuwon not due back from hernia surgery until late
January at the soonest, the Rockets have completely turned over
their starting lineup since last season. Only one current starter,
Walt Williams, has ever held that job before, and for Williams that
was three years and two teams ago. No current starter was a Rocket
last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of 16 guys who played for us last year, only three are on
the team right now,'' Tomjanovich said, referring to Cuttino
Mobley, Bryce Drew and Matt Bullard. ``We really have made a big
change. It's just a tremendous opportunity for our young guys.
There's a lot of responsibility, a lot of leadership situations
they're going to have to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things like this happen. Sometimes you get an upset win early;
sometimes you don't. But then you get into acceptance of this is
what we have, this is what we have to work with. I've seen it a lot
of times where you develop a lot of chemistry that's successful.
That's what I hope happens.''
</P>
<P>
   But for that to happen, the Rockets must go back to Chemistry
101. Where Barkley and Olajuwon had taken turns as the fulcrum of
the offense, the Rockets must radically change much of what they
had done offensively and then discover what can work as
consistently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every team has one player, one post guy they know they could
go to when they need him,'' Anderson said. ``Charles was the guy
for us. Utah has Karl (Malone). LA has Shaq (O'Neal). Now we have
to find our guy. We knew we could go to Chuck at the end of the
game. We knew they were going to double-team him, and he would get
the ball out to the open guy. We need one play we go to when
everything is going bad. We haven't found that yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost as if in training camp again, the Rockets must experiment
to uncover the best qualities that remain and hone them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really using it as a growth period, an improvement
period,'' Tomjanovich said. ``It's very valuable time. Hopefully,
we get some good results out of it. That's not the bottom line. I
do want to win, but we all know we've got a lot of new guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sort of a young team now that we don't have those guys
(Barkley and Olajuwon). As good as those guys are and how much we
relied on them, there can be some strengths because of youth _ more
running, different kind of defenses, things like that. More
versatility. Of course, we're not going to have the big entree, the
big meat-and-potatoes deal we know we can expect. It's going to be
interesting how we establish things offensively. It's wide-open
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve (Francis) has had some good things. Cuttino has had some
good things. But we need to expand on that.''
</P>
<P>
   More than changing plays and styles, the Rockets' individual
roles are more fluid than ever. Side dishes must become main
courses. But Rogers said the Rockets also must balance doing more
and trying to do too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people's roles have been defined,'' Rogers said.
``They have changed. We haven't addressed it. Without Chuck and
Dream here, people want to step up. The emotions say `step up.' But
reality is sometimes `stay back.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what we can do as a team to come out of this funk
or whatever it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it should be obvious. Stubbornly refusing to accept
their misfortune could make facing the latest obstacles more
challenging. It also might be the only hope to overcome them.

BUCCANEERS FIND THEMSELVES IN AN UNUSUAL PLACE ATOP DIVISION 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ The Detroit Lions started fast. Sizzling. The
running game was clicking, the passing game hit big notes and the
Lions lapped the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, building a 10-0
first-quarter lead and possessing a 7-point lead midway through the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Lions fizzled. Collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay started with a fizzle. Collapsing all around. Then the
running game clicked and the passing game hit big notes. The
Buccaneers began lapping the Lions.
</P>
<P>
   It was an odd game of opposite patterns, of opposite fortunes,
as Tampa Bay saved its best for last, scoring 14 fourth-quarter
points to rattle Detroit, 23-16, before 65,536 fans at Raymond
James Stadium. In a fight for the division lead, Tampa Bay (9-4)
gained the edge and stands alone in first place in the National
Football Conference Central. Detroit slipped to 8-5. With three
games to play, the Bucs are in first place this late in the season
for the first time since 1981. It won its sixth straight, a
franchise record. And broke a four-game losing streak against the
Lions.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit quarterback Gus Frerotte (23 of 44 for 241 yards, no
touchdowns, 4 sacks, 1 interception) and his offense got the early
jump.
</P>
<P>
   But the Buccaneers' rookie quarterback, Shaun King (23 of 37 for
297 yards, 2 touchdowns, 3 sacks, 1 interception), and his crew
dominated in the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We showed that we can come back in the fourth quarter and
that's something we haven't done a lot,'' said King, making his
second pro start; he is 2-0. ``I'm not afraid to win. I'm not
afraid to make mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bucs played King conservatively until the fourth quarter. He
entered having passed 27 times for 206 yards and with his team
trailing 13-9. Detroit kicked a field goal early in the quarter to
earn a 16-9 lead.
</P>
<P>
   And then the collapse.
</P>
<P>
   A Mike Alstott 1-yard touchdown run. A Frerotte interception
returned 28 yards to the Detroit 24 by safety John Lynch. An
Alstott 22-yard catch and run off a screen pass where the Lions
were destroyed, falling over themselves and blocked, too, on the
touchdown with 4:18 left. That would give Tampa Bay its first lead
of the game. And the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our opportunities; we missed them,'' said Bobby Ross,
the Detroit head coach. ``We had control of the game let them get
back in it. The screen plays _ we've got to defend that a lot
better. We're not out of it yet. We'll be fighting and maybe we'll
get a chance to come right back here.''
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's plan to build a quick first-quarter lead and then
unleash its defense on King in hopes that he would answer with
mistakes nearly worked. The Lions leaped to a 10-0 lead in the
game's first 14 minutes and then early in the second quarter
recovered a King fumble.
</P>
<P>
   But King in the final minutes of the half connected with Warrick
Dunn on a 68-yard pass play that injected spirit into the sleepy
Tampa Bay offense and crowd. That play set up Tampa Bay's only
first-half score. Thus, Detroit led, 10-7, at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit dominated for the initial 14 minutes. In the first
quarter, it won in total yards by 114 to 52 and limited Tampa Bay
to 3 first downs and 9 rushing yards. Detroit drove to the Tampa
Bay 19 on its first possession and scored on a Jason Hanson 37-yard
field goal. With :52 seconds left in the quarter, Greg Hill sped 10
yards around left end for a touchdown. The key play in that drive
was a Frerotte 48-yard pass to a diving receiver, Johnnie Morton,
who caught it and landed flat and face-first at the Tampa Bay 22.
</P>
<P>
   King and the Tampa offense struggled early because the Lions
defense tackled the run and pass with equal effectiveness. And the
Detroit third-down defense was especially smart. Tampa could not
convert a third-and-18 and a third-and-10 on its first two
possessions and then on its third possession fumbled. King took a
snap from the Detroit 32, dropped in the pocket, attempted to pass
under presser from end Robert Porcher, but the ball slipped out of
his hands. Tackle Luther Ellis recovered for Detroit at the Detroit
44.
</P>
<P>
   That series could have proved fatal for Tampa Bay. Had Detroit
used that mistake to build a 17-0 advantage, how would King and the
Tampa Bay offense respond? Could they respond? The Buccaneers
defense, however, would not allow Detroit to pull away. The teams
would trade possession for the next four series and then with 1:40
remaining in the half, King found Dunn.
</P>
<P>
   It was your basic, soft, swing pass to the right flat but Dunn
took it and turned it upfield, down the right sideline for 68 yards
to the Detroit 7. A facemask penalty on Detroit cornerback J.B.
Brown while tackling Dunn moved the ball to the Detroit 4. And on
the next play, King calmly swung a play-fake pass to the left flat,
to fullback Kevin McLeod, who bobbled the pass, braced it against
his facemask and held on for the score with 1:34 left before
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit controlled the game for more than 28 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Then King and Dunn and Tampa struck.
</P>
<P>
   That was the nature of this game _ in a blink, a turnaround, a
few big plays, and the game turned Tampa Bay's way.

YOUNG AMERICA ELIMINATED WHEN ANOTHER U.S. BOAT FORFEITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By HERB McCORMICK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barring a catastrophe to the French yacht Le Defi Francais, the
New York Yacht Club's four-year, $30 million quest to regain the
America's Cup came to an abrupt conclusion Monday. Its entry, Young
America, was eliminated in the third round of the Louis Vuitton
challengers' trials in Auckland, New Zealand, when the skipper of
another American yacht decided not to sail and forfeited a race to
the French.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Sunday's match with Dawn Riley's San Francisco-based
America True syndicate, Young America's fate was in its own hands.
Had it swept its final three races, it would have secured the sixth
and final spot in the challengers' semifinal series, which begins
Jan. 2.
</P>
<P>
   But, as has happened so often in this nightmarish round, the New
Yorkers found themselves on the wrong side of the first critical
wind shift, and they lost to the Californians by 2 minutes 5
seconds. With the loss, they suddenly needed help from other
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Young America needed America True to defeat Le
Defi _ its sole remaining rival for the final semifinal slot _ in a
race scheduled for Monday. Had America True triumphed, it could
have set up a sudden-death contest between the French and New
Yorkers on the series' final day.
</P>
<P>
   But with her berth in the semifinals already assured, and a
potentially gear-busting forecast of 20- to 40-knot breezes for
Monday, Riley elected to officially retire from the round and
forfeit the race to Le Defi.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Le Defi must sail the course uncontested to earn the points
for a victory; when that formality is completed, Young America's
run will officially be over. But the exercise was canceled Monday
when the gale-force winds postponed all racing. The one-boat race
has been re-scheduled for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made absolutely no sense to go out and bash our boat around
for points that mean absolutely nothing,'' Riley said by telephone
from Auckland, New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   Riley admitted that her no-go decision might raise controversy,
but added, ``People who were supporting New York could see it that
way, but the sailors competing here will understand. This is a
competition and we're out here to win. We're a one-boat program and
we can't do that if we break our boat.''
</P>
<P>
   In last October's opening round of the series, Young America
established itself as one of the elite challenging teams. But the
tide turned on Nov. 9, when one of the syndicate's two boats
cracked and nearly sank. From that point on, New York victories
were few and far between.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if America True had raced today and forced a final match
between the French and Young America, the speculation here is that
the French would have won,'' said Keith Taylor, a Louis Vuitton
spokesman, by telephone. ``In recent weeks, Young America just
hasn't displayed efficient boat speed and the tactical smarts to
beat people at the top level.''
</P>
<P>
   Young America president John Marshall agreed that his team's
problems were multifaceted. ``People wonder how a team with so much
potential could fall short,'' he said in a conference call from
Auckland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's hard to identify a single factor,'' he added.
``We didn't fall short by losing one critical race to one key
competitor. The fact that Sunday's race was vital was because we'd
lost other races. We have a situation where, on the whole, the
program under-performed starting in mid-November. And we couldn't
put the brakes on during the December series.''
</P>
<P>
   For the New York Yacht Club, Monday's developments had an
unsettling precedent. In the club's last Cup campaign, in 1987, its
well-funded, star-studded squad also started quickly but ultimately
failed to advance to the challengers' semifinal round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised,'' Riley said, echoing the sentiment along the
Auckland docks. ``After that first round this time around, you
never would've thought New York would be in this position right
now.'' &QL;

EDITORIAL: CHANGE AND CRISIS IN NURSING HOMES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Dec. 13:
</P>
<P>
   As the American population ages, more and more of its oldest and
frailest members spend their last years in nursing homes. In
Florida, a laboratory of old age, it is estimated that one-fifth of
the deaths in the state each year occur in nursing homes. But the
American nursing home industry today is itself in uncertain health,
and some of its biggest operators may be in terminal financial
shape.
</P>
<P>
   Homes for the aged in the 19th century were often founded by
churches and towns as small, not-for-profit institutions. The trend
in the last decades, however, has been toward ownership by large,
publicly traded, for-profit chains.
</P>
<P>
   Wary of how the profit motive can compete with the cost of
giving good care, New York state blocks publicly traded companies
from operating nursing homes in the state. But Wall Street helps
finance them in other states, and two of the biggest of those
national chains, Vencor and Sun Healthcare, have filed for Chapter
11 protection in the last three months.
</P>
<P>
   Two others, Mariner and Integrated Health Services, are trading
at pennies a share. Five of the largest chains, with almost 20
percent of all the nursing home beds in the country, are now
operating at a loss. Another big chain, Beverly Enterprises,
recently agreed to reimburse the federal government for more than
$170 million in Medicare billings after a federal audit.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis and turmoil among the chain operators is not typical
of the industry as a whole, but the changes and pressures they face
are. Many of the chains in trouble specialized in the kind of
therapeutic and rehabilitative care that Medicare once freely
reimbursed but now does not. With stricter reimbursement standards
imposed in January, federal dollars for long-term care could fall
by 20 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time one part of the federal government was
tightening its payment policies, another began cracking down on
recurrent evidence of abuse and neglect of residents in nursing
homes, much of which has occurred in chains.
</P>
<P>
   Better, more attentive care costs more in time and labor than
does indifferent care. But about two-thirds of nursing home
patients are indigents whose care is subsidized by Medicaid, and
state legislatures, which set Medicaid reimbursement rates, have
been determined to hold those already huge costs down.
</P>
<P>
   Only recently, in such states as California, have efforts begun
to appropriate dollars targeted to raise the wages of the nurses'
aides who give residents most of their care. But in California,
that money was included in the most comprehensive nursing reform
bill passed by the legislature in 20 years, which was vetoed in
October by Gov. Gray Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The changes and crises in the nursing home industry are
occurring without national debate and the participation of those
most affected, the homes' 1.6 million residents. They do not, for
the most part, vote. They often cannot walk or talk.
</P>
<P>
   As the handsome new assisted-living facilities that have sprung
up everywhere in this decade have attracted the youngest, most
vigorous and affluent of the elderly, nursing homes have become
filled with the poorest, sickest and neediest.
</P>
<P>
   The change has come about very quickly. In Florida, where there
are 70,000 nursing home residents, there are now 66,000 others in
assisted living facilities, with new facilities being licensed at
the rate of 85 each month of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Assisted-living facilities have been popular with developers
because they are not burdened by the licensing requirements or
regulations that govern nursing homes, and the elderly are glad for
an alternative.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs, such as vacancies and depressed stock prices,
that the assisted-living market has now been overbuilt. But the one
demographic certainty is that the number of the very old and infirm
will continue to grow, and that the nursing home industry will have
to change to accommodate them. All those with aging relatives, or
conscious that their own years are passing, need to pay attention.

KNICKS USE THEIR DEPTH TO WEAR DOWN THE CELTICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Marcus Camby did not have a warm look for Coach Jeff
Van Gundy every time he was pulled off the floor and replaced by
Patrick Ewing Sunday night, but the sound of the chorus is what
counts. And the depth of the Knicks' talent drowned out everything
else at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter that Ewing finished 3 for 11 from the field
with 9 points when Van Gundy could throw stars at the Boston
Celtics with the repetition of a Pop-a-Shot arcade game. After
Latrell Sprewell and Kurt Thomas pushed the team through the first
half, Houston and Larry Johnson combined to nudge their team past
the Celtics the rest of the way in a tight 99-97 victory that
lifted the Knicks to a 13-9 record.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, who entered the night shooting just 36 percent over his
last four games, missed four of his first six shots before
finishing the night with 26 points on a 11-for-20 effort. Sprewell,
who added some color to the Knicks' bland beginning, ended with 17
points and four steals. But it was Johnson (23 points) who
delivered in the most difficult minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics turned up their pressure and forced the Knicks into
some sloppy play at the end. A healthy 12-point lead midway through
the fourth was down to 90-87 with 2:15 left in the game. But
Johnson came on to lead the Knicks to the finish with 7 points in
the last two minutes of the game and forced a turnover by Antoine
Walker with one second left in the game to end the threat of a tie
or loss.
</P>
<P>
   Houston is the one who gave the Celtics a chance. He missed two
free throws with 2.1 seconds left and the score 99-97. Camby, who
has been irritated about the potential for a drop in minutes due to
the return of Ewing to the starting lineup, ended the night with 1
point and two rebounds in 20 minutes. In the end, Camby did get a
steal to help protect the Knicks' fragile lead. The Celtics were
led by Walker's 24 points.
</P>
<P>
   A drowsy-looking Knicks team got jarred from its slumber when
the energetic Celtics came out with their usual frenzied style and
opened a 22-13 lead. After two angry timeouts called by Van Gundy,
Sprewell acted as smelling salts for the team. He made a steal that
led to a fast-break layup by Chris Childs, then hit a 3-pointer to
bring the Knicks back to life and pull them to 24-19.
</P>
<P>
   They quickly went ahead, 29-28, early in the second quarter
after a pull-up jumper by Sprewell in transition. A few minutes
later, the Knicks went on a 16-2 run to take a 51-35 lead with 2:43
left in the half and held a 55-43 edge entering the third quarter
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell's second-quarter partner in sapping the Celtics' spirit
was an unlikely suspect. It was Kurt Thomas, receiving Sprewell's
passes for layups in transition and putting back the Knicks'
misses. While Sprewell ended the half with 12 points, 4 assists and
3 steals, Thomas led the Knicks with 13 points.
</P>
<P>
   The duo made Ewing's struggles insignificant. At halftime, Ewing
was 0 for 6 from the field, bringing his total through six quarters
since his return from injury to 0 for 14. The silence of Ewing's
offense changed in the second minute of the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   It was a show-stopping moment. Ewing had the ball in the post,
wheeled to the middle in front of Vitaly Potapenko, then put up an
awkward turn-around jumper that fell as he was fouled to give him a
3-point opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   With 10:57 on the clock, the crowd stood in an ovation for
Ewing's first field goal of the season. But the fans quickly let
out a sigh as Ewing missed the free throw. Still, he had scored his
first points since June 1, the night he partially tore his left
Achilles' tendon in Indiana during Game 2 of the Eastern Conference
finals.
</P>
<P>
   It was a start for Ewing. He was still winded and often wandered
down the floor long after Sprewell or another teammate was scoring.
But Ewing's reflexes were impressively keen as he became an
intimidating force in the paint with four blocked shots through
three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being an albatross, Ewing became the complement to
the Knicks. He helped protect them from inside drives, and they
looked for him, too. Johnson saw Ewing sneak open under the basket,
fired a bullet pass and watched his 37-year-old center dunk the
ball to give the Knicks a 63-50 lead with 8:30 left in the third.
The unselfish Knicks had a good inside-outside mix going.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more we go inside, the better we are,'' Van Gundy said
before the game. ``When we play inside-out, and I don't know why
this is, but we play better defense. We're 9-1 when we have more
assists than our opponents.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks were headed that way through three quarters. Using
crisp passes, the Knicks were beating the pressure defense the
Celtics thrive on, a fact not even Van Gundy was expecting.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got great anticipation,'' Van Gundy said. ``The way we
pass, I'm sure they are salivating.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being turnover-prone, the Knicks were mentally into
the game. The only letdown of the third quarter came when Ewing,
perhaps getting a little greedy, called for the ball twice in the
paint and missed both times on jumpers, allowing the Celtics to
pull to 63-55 with six minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   With Ewing on the bench resting, Houston was able to connect on
a couple of jumpers and find a groove he had been missing of late.
His 9 third-quarter points helped the Knicks take a 73-61 lead
after three quarters. Instead of looking disjointed, as they had
against Philadelphia in a tough victory on Friday, the Knicks had a
comfortable look about them heading into the fourth quarter.

 CASINO MAY BE A MAJOR PLAYER IN CATSKILLS COMEBACK  (jw) 
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTICELLO, N.Y. _ Gene Barbanti, a real estate broker from New
Jersey, moved to the Catskills 30 years ago and bought some land
cheap, thinking that the borscht belt had nowhere to go but up.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the bungalow colonies and grand hotels where Danny
Kaye, Milton Berle and Buddy Hackett once entertained vacationing
New Yorkers died a lingering death over the next three decades. It
left Sullivan County a depressed backwater, only 90 miles northwest
of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   But with the growing possibility of a $500 million casino
opening in Monticello, Barbanti has emerged in the last year as the
unofficial grand marshal of the great Sullivan County land rush. He
recently sold the 236-acre Shawanga Lodge property in Wurtsboro and
the old Laurels resort on Sackett Lake in Thompson and is
completing the sale of an 800-acre tract in Wurtsboro Hills. All in
all, powerful and well-connected investors and developers have
snapped up more than $40 million worth of wooded land, dormant
hotels and golf courses in 10 major deals over the last year, with
plans to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in resorts,
second-home communities and attractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not your grandfather's Catskills anymore,'' Barbanti
said at his office in Liberty, where storefront after storefront
sits hauntingly empty. ``This is a place waiting to be rediscovered
and I think we're on the threshold.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopes for a Catskill revival have fallen flat in the past. But
with Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt likely to decide by January
or February whether to approve a casino proposed by the St. Regis
Mohawks next to the Monticello Raceway, more money and muscle are
betting on it than ever before. And as developers continue to
propose ambitious, big-dollar projects, the future of the Catskills
seems increasingly tied to two factors. The first is whether the
region will get casino gambling. The second is whether it can come
back without it.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, gambling has been held up as a tantalizing cure-all
for the region's economic doldrums. But now many advocates, though
not all, expect Babbitt to approve the tribe's casino application
and send it to Gov. George Pataki for a final decision. Although
the governor has not indicated what he will do, Pataki thinks
casinos ``make economic sense in traditional resort areas like the
Catskills,'' said his spokesman, Michael McKeon.
</P>
<P>
   A revival would be the third wave of prosperity to wash over the
Catskills. From the 1890s until World War I, the cool mountains and
lakes of the area were a favorite respite from the city's
sweltering heat and tuberculosis for Italian and Irish immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   During the golden age of the Catskills, from 1940 to the
mid-1960s, however, the region became a vacation haven for Jewish
immigrants who flocked to as many as 500 hotels that offered
tennis, swimming, elaborate social programs and legendary nightclub
entertainment. But with advent of inexpensive air fares and the
popularity of European vacations, the Catskills slowly lost their
luster. Today, only a handful of hotels are left.

ELECTION IN CHILE TOO CLOSE TO CALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS for new top with updated vote results. Picks up at 4th graf,
The vote was...) 
(mk) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile _ A first-round presidential vote between a
former aide to the late Socialist president, Salvador Allende
Gossens, and a former official in Gen. Augusto Pinochet's
dictatorship ended in a virtual tie Sunday. The vote capped a
yearlong campaign that has been surprisingly free of tension or
ideology, with both candidates concentrating on practical solutions
to everyday problems involving crime, health care and unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Socialist-Christian Democratic candidate, Ricardo
Lagos, nor his main conservative challenger, Joaquin Lavin, was
able to tally the outright majority required to avert a runoff
election next month because the four minor-party candidates
together wound up with about 5 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   With 99 percent of the vote in, Lagos led Lavin by 47.96 percent
to 47.52 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was seen as a first test of whether an estimated 8
million Chilean voters are ready to rally behind the first serious
presidential contender who is a member of the Socialist Party since
Allende died in a 1973 coup, or elect a right-wing candidate as
president for the first time since Pinochet stepped down in 1990.
Christian Democratic presidents, in coalition with Socialists, have
led Chile since then.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates downplayed the early years of their careers in
more polarized times, and they ran on similar platforms in order to
attract moderate voters. Both promised to make job growth their No.
1 concern, expand public health care in rural areas and overhaul
the nation's police to stem rising crime.
</P>
<P>
   They even agreed on the most sensitive issue in Chilean politics
today: a Spanish judge's efforts to extradite Pinochet from
Britain, where he remains under house-arrest on allegations of
torture. Both candidates said they would continue the current
government's policy of contesting the extradition so that Pinochet
might face justice in the Chilean courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both candidates are exorcising the demons of the past,'' said
Lucia Santa Cruz, a historian. ``If Lavin wins, we will have an
alternation of government, which is an essential ingredient of
democracy. And if Lagos wins we will have a Socialist president who
hopefully will prove that Socialists can govern with political and
economic stability.''
</P>
<P>
   But other analysts were critical that neither candidate made
much of an effort to address several issues tied to the past, like
whether to start investigations of torture under the military
regime or to rewrite a constitution, prepared while Pinochet still
ruled, that gives the military several appointed senators and
independent powers over its budget and command structure.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos' slogan, ``Growth With Equality,'' and Lavin's slogan,
``Long Live Change,'' sound as if they belong to the same campaign.
But for all their similar proposals and caution, the 61-year-old
Lagos and the 46-year-old Lavin have offered the voters a contrast
in resumes and campaign styles.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer and economist, Lagos was Allende's candidate to become
ambassador to the Soviet Union at the time of the Pinochet coup.
But Lagos has preferred to emphasize his service as minister of
education and minister of public works in the two governments led
by Christian Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   He has promised to fill his Cabinet with many Christian
Democrats, who continue to form the largest party in Lagos'
coalition, in an effort to retain the support of more conservative
Christian Democrats who express fear that a Socialist president
could upset the country's stability.
</P>
<P>
   An engineer who studied economics at the University of Chicago,
Lavin worked in Pinochet's Planning Ministry. But he has preferred
to publicize his programs to control traffic congestion, control
gang activity and create charter schools in his seven years as
mayor of the Santiago community of Las Condes.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to stir an increasingly apolitical youth vote, Lavin has
run a tightly scripted, populist campaign that warms up crowds with
rap music, dueling drummers and clowns on stilts. He frequently
shuns hotels while touring the country, preferring to stay in
peoples' homes _ favoring recent victims of crime to emphasize his
interest in the issue.
</P>
<P>
   His most effective applause line is a promise that he will end
the policy of the last two Christian Democratic presidents of
blocking executions of convicted murderers, but otherwise he has
positioned himself as a liberal reformer.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At a campaign rally in Santiago last week, Lavin said his dream
was to see that the child of a poor Mapuche Indian standing on the
platform with him would have the same educational opportunities as
his seven children have had. ``I don't believe in a country that
pits the rich against the poor,'' he said, ``nor a country that
pits civilians against military officers nor a country that pits
businessmen against workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Lagos has run a more traditional and, until the last few weeks,
a rather lackluster campaign that has exhibited difficulty in
parrying Lavin's liberal-sounding campaign without going too far to
the left itself.
</P>
<P>
   But Lagos' Christian Democratic-Socialist coalition appeared to
make an effective maneuver earlier this month when it brought a new
labor law to the floor of the Senate that would have given
collective bargaining rights to an additional 2.5 million workers.
When senators belonging to the two conservative parties backing
Lavin blocked the legislation, Lagos mocked Lavin's contention that
he is an agent of change who would uplift the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday the right took their covering off and showed whose
interests they really represent,'' Lagos said triumphantly at a
rally a week ago in the port of Valparaiso. ``The same right that
opposes the workers and who supported the dictatorship now are the
ones who call for change.'' He later added, ``When we speak of
equality it's not just a slogan, it's a principle we have fought
for all our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Just how far Chile has come in recent years could be seen Sunday
at the National Stadium, where the military gathered thousands of
leftists during the 1973 coup for torture, execution or forced
exile. On Sunday, conservatives, Socialists and even Communists
formed long, neat lines to vote _ without incident _ as military
police in fatigues looked on under a blazing sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our dreams of 30 years ago have had to change,'' said Nelson
Miranda, 44, an art teacher who said he voted for Lagos. ``Today we
Socialists are talking about taking the best from capitalism but
then better redistributing the wealth.''
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Santana, 22, a marketing assistant at a public relations
firm, said he voted for Lavin because ``we need fewer words and
more action, change, new ideas and younger people in government.''

McCARRON WINS ABOARD GENERAL CHALLENGE 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Chris McCarron demonstrated Sunday that
Laffit Pincay isn't the only Hall of Famer who's still riding high
at Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
   McCarron, astride General Challenge for the first time, urged
the Santa Anita Derby and Pacific Classic winner to a neck victory
over determined Moore's Flat in the $100,000 Native Diver Handicap
to complete a three-win afternoon for the jockey.
</P>
<P>
   The negative was that heavily favored General Challenge ($3)
needed the length of the stretch to get by a horse whose only
stakes victory came at Fairplex Park.
</P>
<P>
   The positive, as far as trainer Bob Baffert was concerned, was
McCarron, named to replace David Flores after Golden Eagle
Farm-owned General Challenge ran a laggardly 10th in the Breeders'
Cup Classic at Gulfstream Park to lose any chance for Horse of the
Year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the stretch it looked like he wasn't going to pass (Moore's
Flat),'' Baffert said. ``But when Chris hit him left-handed, I
think that got his attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a ferocious left-handed whip.''
</P>
<P>
   This marked the first time since his maiden victory 12 months
ago that 3-year-old General Challenge won a photo finish. He was
edged by Cat Thief in the Swaps Stakes and Budroyale in the
Goodwood. He won the Santa Anita Derby by 3{ lengths and the
Pacific Classic by three.
</P>
<P>
   McCarron had thought he was going to ride General Challenge in
the Santa Anita Derby before Baffert abruptly switched back to Gary
Stevens. Apparently, McCarron got the mount Sunday in part to make
up for that disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert stopped short of saying the jockey change made a
difference Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a fight,'' McCarron, 44, said of the victory,
accomplished in a slow time of 1:49.07 for 1[ miles.
</P>
<P>
   General Challenge carried a race-high 123 pounds, Moore's Flat
117. Koslanin finished third in the six-horse field.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert said General Challenge would race next at Santa Anita in
the Jan. 15 San Fernando Stakes for 4-year-olds. He plans to send
General Challenge out of state _ where the colt has run badly in
three tries _ ``when the time is right.''
</P>
<P>
   And counting: Knowing Pincay, he won't let down now that he's
the winningest jockey of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Though winless Sunday, and 1 for 11 since the record-breaking
victory aboard Irish Nip on Friday, Pincay will go into the
Hollywood Park meet's final week only one behind Pat Valenzuela at
the top of the standings.
</P>
<P>
   Valenzuela broke a tie by winning Sunday's opener with
Innovative.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay, 52, hasn't had a riding title since the 1991 Hollywood
summer season. Bill Shoemaker's last title came at the 1975 Oak
Tree meet, when he was 44.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to go for it,'' Pincay said of the title. ``It's on
my mind. I'm a fighter.''
</P>
<P>
   He also has his mind on 9,000. Pincay's victory Saturday aboard
Minor Details was No. 8,835.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: California's Big Jag finished third to Fairy King Prawn
in the $680,000 Hong Kong Sprint at Sha Tin Race Course Sunday.
Other winners on the big international card: Jim and Tonic in the
$1.3 million Hong Kong Cup, Docksider in the $900,000 Mile (with
California's Self Feeder seventh) and Borgia in the $900,000 Vase.
... The winner in the contest challenging fans to predict the day
and race in which Laffit Pincay set the record turned out to be Ina
Sue Shulman, wife of trainer Sandy Shulman. She was presented
Sunday with a $17,668 check, $8,834 doubled because she was at the
track Friday. Six entrants picked the correct race but Shulman won
because she submitted her entry earliest, on Nov. 11. ... Pincay,
whose record chase has helped Hollywood Park to improve its on-site
attendance by nearly 6 percent over the 1998 autumn meet, is
scheduled to sign posters from 11 a.m. to noon Saturday.

SMALL AND DEFIANT PARTY HAS A BIG VOICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Michael Long, a man of obvious intelligence and
energy, did not finish the 12th grade at Richmond Hill High School
in Queens. Instead, a few months from graduation in 1959, he joined
the Marines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just was that kind of a kid,'' Long recalled with a throaty
laugh, shaking his head. ``There were times when they were talking
about throwing me out of school. And then I wound up on the honor
roll. And then after I did that, I decided to leave and go to the
Marine Corps. I was just contrary. So I guess I've been contrary
all my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The same must be said of the Conservative Party, headed by Long.
It was conceived in reaction to New York's liberal brand of
Republicanism, nurtured by the unfashionably resolute and erudite
conservatism of William F. Buckley Jr., raised on a series of
long-shot campaigns, and toughened, in those early years, by a
political atmosphere that was downright hostile to it.
</P>
<P>
   The Conservative Party, which exists only in New York, has acted
as the defiant, doctrinaire little brother to its more malleable
sibling, the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   The two have grown cozier in the last generation as the
Conservatives have succeeded in their original aim of drawing the
Republicans rightward, yet Long and company still tend to view the
Republican Party as insufficiently pure on issues like smaller
government and opposition to abortion. And, remarkably, they remain
willing to tell the Republicans to take a hike, even when the
stakes are enormous.
</P>
<P>
   That tension is more evident than ever now, as the Conservative
Party weighs whether to back Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a Republican,
in his expected race next year against Hillary Rodham Clinton for
the U.S. Senate. Long insists that in return for his party's
support, the mayor must forgo the backing of the Liberal Party, a
source of succor throughout his political career, and switch
positions to oppose a form of late-term abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Long has something Giuliani needs, control of the Conservative
ballot line _ no Republican has won a statewide race without it
since 1974 _ and that puts Long in a powerful position.
</P>
<P>
   If the mayor accepts his terms, the Conservatives will have
forced an important Republican to mold himself to their liking. If
not, Long says, his party will run its own candidate, taking votes
on the right away from the mayor, even if that might mean handing
the contest to Mrs. Clinton. It is a potent threat, one that
reminds every Republican moderate of the cost of crossing the
Conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   There are just 172,000 registered Conservatives, 1.6 percent of
the state's voters, but the party's appeal to conservative
Republicans and independents, and its ability to play the spoiler,
make it a far greater force than those numbers suggest. In recent
years, it has drawn 200,000 to 800,000 votes on its own line in
statewide elections. That could be enough to sway a Senate race in
which about 6 million votes will be cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it was ever the vision that the Conservative
Party would overtake the Republican party,'' Long said. ``We've
always understood that the Conservative Party is a philosophical
movement more than a political party.'' And unlike an ordinary
political party, it can stomach moves that might aid its
traditional opponents, the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   That willingness to undermine Republicans is what gives the
Conservatives their power, forcing the Republicans to court them.
It is a threat that has been the core of the party's strategy since
its creation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1960s, Republicans dominated politics in the state,
but an ideological conservative had no political home here. The
state's top Republicans _ Gov. Nelson Rockefeller, Sen. Jacob
Javits, Sen. Kenneth Keating, Attorney General Louis Lefkowitz _
were moderate to liberal. Republicans sometimes competed with
Democrats for the Liberal Party line.
</P>
<P>
   So in early 1962, Daniel Mahoney and Kieran O'Doherty _ Wall
Street lawyers, brothers-in-law, and alienated conservatives _
invented the Conservative Party as a counterweight to the Liberals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intellectual wellspring from which it came was Bill
Buckley and National Review,'' his magazine, said Kieran Mahoney, a
Republican political consultant who is the son of Daniel Mahoney.
``The agenda was anti-communism, tough on drugs and welfare,
limited government.''
</P>
<P>
   The early leaders of the party were an unusually intellectual
bunch for pols, starting with Buckley. Three of them _ Henry and
Anne Paolucci, and Charles Rice _ were college professors, as was
Paul Adams, the party's two-time nominee for governor. Daniel
Mahoney later became a federal appeals court judge.
</P>
<P>
   They were unusual in another way, as well. Across the country,
``movement conservatives'' have tended to be Protestant. But nearly
all the early Conservative Party leaders were Roman Catholic,
particularly downstate, where the party was strongest. Long said
many of the founders admired Sen. Joseph McCarthy, another Catholic
conservative who felt abandoned by the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were guys who were aghast at Vatican II,'' Kieran
Mahoney said. ``The Republicans in New York City had a kind of
wealthy-class, Protestant-elite stigma attached to them. Between
that and the liberalism of the Rockefeller Republicans, these
conservative Catholics just weren't comfortable as Republicans. I
would guess the Conservative Party is still more heavily Catholic
than either of the major parties.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, the Conservative Party nominated Buckley for mayor of
New York City, and he drew more than 300,000 votes, 13 percent of
the total, in a three-way race won by Rep. John Lindsay, a liberal
Republican. It was a watershed campaign for the Conservatives, who
gained heavy publicity and proved their strength in the
overwhelmingly Democratic city.
</P>
<P>
   The Conservatives suddenly seemed a real force, and they were
vilified by the other parties and the news media. The party's
opposition to welfare programs and forced school busing was
frequently portrayed as racist.
</P>
<P>
   Though Rockefeller tried hard to kill the new party _ he
pressured Republicans not to accept Conservative support _ its
following grew, presaging the national shift rightward over the
next generation. The party's support came mainly from those who
would later be called Reagan Democrats _ working-class, urban and
suburban, often Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   It reached its high-water mark in 1970, when James L. Buckley,
brother of William, won election to the Senate in a tight three-way
race. He remains the only Conservative candidate ever to have won a
statewide race without the Republican line.
</P>
<P>
   The Conservatives began working more closely with the
Republicans in the 1970s, making a gradual transition from
antagonists to mercurial allies. The Conservatives found they could
sway Republican nominations by taking sides in primaries, as they
did in 1980, helping Alfonse D'Amato unseat Javits.
</P>
<P>
   With that victory, the last of the major liberal Republicans
were gone, and D'Amato, Conservative ally and opponent of abortion
rights, was New York's most powerful Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, most Republican candidates for state and local
offices have had Conservative Party support. In last year's
legislative races, 131 Republican candidates had the Conservative
line, too; only 11 Democrats did.
</P>
<P>
   Since Long, 59, a former community school board and City Council
member, became chairman in 1988, the party has been his show. From
the cramped state headquarters in a walk-up above a storefront in
Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, chosen for its proximity to his liquor store,
he rules the party with the gruff, gabby charm of the Irish and
Italian immigrants he grew up around.
</P>
<P>
   In short, he is liked by Republicans and Conservatives alike.
But he is also feared. Like his predecessors, Long has been willing
to play havoc with his Republican partners. And he has shown a
particular reluctance to embrace Giuliani, a vocal supporter of
abortion rights, who had the city formally recognize same-sex
domestic partnerships, who endorsed Gov. Mario Cuomo, a Democrat,
in 1994, and who proposed a casino on Governors Island.
</P>
<P>
   The Conservatives ran their own candidates for mayor of New York
City in 1989 and 1993, rather than support Giuliani, though he was
locked in tight races both times against David Dinkins. When
Giuliani ran for re-election in 1997, the nearest Long would go
toward supporting him was to leave the Conservative line blank, and
he notes, pointedly, ``I didn't vote.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, the Conservative Party rejected the Republicans' choice
for governor, Pierre Rinfret, and instead nominated Herbert London,
who attacked Rinfret as aggressively as he did Cuomo. London
collected more than 800,000 votes, 20 percent of the total, nearly
outpolling Rinfret.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a little scary,'' Long said. If London had finished
second, ``There would have been an infusion of people changing
their registration, and you would have seen other players trying to
take over the party. It would have become totally a political party
and lost its vision.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, David does not really want to kill Goliath; he
just wants to tell Goliath how to behave.
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 race for governor changed life for the Conservatives.
They backed Gov. George Pataki, a Republican, but had to bend
further than ever to make the endorsement. The party embraced his
proposals for lower taxes and tougher criminal penalties, and
overlooked his support for gay rights and abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki drew more than 300,000 votes on the Conservative line,
double his slender winning margin over Cuomo. It was the first time
the Conservatives had nominated a winner for governor, giving the
party a greater voice than ever in Albany, and access to a vast
patronage pool.
</P>
<P>
   So it appears that Long has more than ever to lose by bucking
the Republican Party. But maybe not. The consensus among
Republicans is that Pataki would be unwilling to break with the
Conservatives over their refusal to support Giuliani _ a trade
that, for the governor, would mean losing a powerful ally for the
sake of a mayor with whom he has brittle relations.
</P>
<P>
   Long agrees with Republican leaders that Giuliani would be the
strongest opponent for Mrs. Clinton. ``I don't contest that, and I
don't contest the fact that he's done a wonderful job as mayor,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the mayor has lately become a convenient
conservative,'' Long added. ``We're not just about winning
elections.''

GENE HUNTER LEAVES UW TO CREATE NEW MODEL FOR SCIENCE RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Dr. Leroy Hood, renowned for developing the technology
that has helped propel the worldwide race to decipher the human
genetic code, is leaving the University of Washington to start a
private venture here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a chance to change the way science is done,'' Hood
said Sunday. ``I want to create a model for how academic
institutions will operate in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   How academia and the public university system operate today
turned out to be a bit too constrained for the envelope-pushing,
entrepreneurial scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Hood is forming a private, nonprofit institute that will become
a ``scientific melting pot'' for experts focused on marrying
biology with computer science.
</P>
<P>
   The union promises to revolutionize medicine by creating new
tools for diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease at the
molecular level.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute for Systems Biology already has netted an
anonymous donation of $5 million toward start-up costs, and Hood is
talking to Merck and Immunex about potential projects.
</P>
<P>
   Hood envisions a small campus located near other research
institutions in town. He emphasized that his institute will be much
more than just another biotech start-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be an enormous integrator of technologies,'' Hood
said. Biologists working to understand living creatures will work
with computer scientists and engineers skilled at deciphering the
language of life.
</P>
<P>
   He wants the institute to focus on long-term scientific
problems, not just drug development or other short-term
achievements.
</P>
<P>
   Hood hopes his institute will be a place where scientists follow
their interests, but also where researchers give back to society.
He and his wife, Valerie Logan, have spent years working to improve
the teaching of science from kindegarten through high school.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Hood said, he wants to create a new kind of academic
enterprise _ a model for how science should be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really think this will be a unique approach,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of running his own show, without the bureaucratic
obstacles and political snarls of the university, is a bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the impatient type. ... I'm ready to be my own boss,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hood was recruited to Seattle in 1992 from the California
Institute of Technology in Pasadena, thanks largely to a $12
million grant from Microsoft chairman Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   The Gates donation created the UW Department of Molecular
Biotechnology with Hood _ as the William Gates III Professor of
Biomedical Sciences _ at the helm. The department has grown since
Hood took over, from a $3.5 million start-up budget to $32 million
last year.
</P>
<P>
   UW President Richard McCormick said Sunday he was sorry to lose
Hood but expects a continued, close collaboration between the
university and the gene hunter's new research institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lee feels he needs the independence provided by the institute
to accomplish (his) goals,'' McCormick said. Hood has done a
``brilliant job'' bringing in talent and building up the UW
research program in the fast-paced, high stakes field of molecular
biology, biotechnology and genetics, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has benefited the university greatly,'' agreed Dr. Maynard
Olson, director of the UW arm of the Human Genome Project.
</P>
<P>
   The federal project, sponsored by the National Institutes of
Health, aims to identify and decode all of the 60,000 to 100,000
genes of the human body. Hood's lab at Caltech developed automated
genetic decoding, or ``sequencing,'' machines that have greatly
speeded up the analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hood likes to start new things, to move from one start-up to
another,'' Olson said. ``Now he wants to try something new.''
</P>
<P>
   Last April, he and the UW announced plans to create the
Institute for Quantitative Systems Biology, a public-private
venture intended to exploit the increasing amounts of genetic
information made available by the genome project.
</P>
<P>
   It was to be operated by the UW School of Medicine off-campus
with an annual budget of $100 million. Hood had agreed to seek
funding independently from government, industry and other sources.
The agri-chemical company Monsanto had already funded plant-genome
research.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Ramsey, dean of the UW School of Medicine, heralded the
project as ``the future of biomedical research. ... Ensuring the
success of the institute is, and will remain, among the School of
Medicine's top priorities well into the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, the vision for this institute leaves with Hood,
and success or failure will rest solely on his shoulders. He likes
it that way.
</P>
<P>
   Hood said he and the UW administration agreed they needed to
part ways. He has been a strong advocate of academic-industrial
partnerships in science _ sometimes too strong for his scientific
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   When he first came to the UW, Hood helped found Darwin, a
biotechnology start-up company. Some of his colleagues grumbled
that he was more interested in business than science.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the then-dean of the medical school, the late Dr.
Phil Fialkow, ordered Hood to contribute all of his founder's stock
to charity to avoid any appearance of personal aggrandizement or
conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty annoyed at the time,'' admitted Hood. He said
other faculty who had established companies hadn't been so
constrained. Now, he said, the $2 million charitable foundation
created with his founder's stock is something he's proud to see
used for education and conservation projects.

SPORTS COLUMN: RAY FROM RUTGERS BEATS A LEGEND 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The hit was a cruncher, Daryl Gardener's
helmet to Ray Lucas', 315 pounds of prime Miami beef sending 214
pounds of worth of raw quarterback crashing to the Jet-green
ground. Lucas would later say that he couldn't seem to get his eyes
to obey the brain's command to open. He remembered the chill of the
artificial turf seeping through the back of his shirt. He heard
familiar voices _ the trainer's and that of his new best friend,
Keyshawn Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas was helped to his feet and staggered to the sideline.
``Stay here!'' Bill Parcells barked. The coach used all of his
renowned medical experience to determine the extent of Lucas'
cerebral damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's No. 6?'' Parcells asked.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas groggily contemplated the question. Then he looked at the
plays scrawled on his wrist tape.
</P>
<P>
   One play later, he returned to the game.
</P>
<P>
   One play after that, he was rolling right, throwing back across
the grain, high and far, to a sprinting Johnson, the kind of pass
made in one's dreams, where Ray from Rutgers somehow morphs into
Dan Marino.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a thrill just to be on the same field with him,'' Lucas
said Sunday after his two fourth-quarter touchdown connections with
the rampaging Johnson took his nowhere Jets past Marino's fading
Dolphins 28-20 at Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, to be young, strong-armed and hard-headed. Marino, better
than anyone, remembers when his body was unfailingly resilient,
when he could throw for 313 yards one week and do it again the next
week without missing a beat.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, a week after he put 34 points on the board in a
last-second defeat to the Indianapolis Colts, Marino had the
unmistakable look of an aging right-hander. He was David Cone
pitching on three days rest. The greatest statistical quarterback
in the history of the sport was outplayed and outpassed, 230-192,
by Parcells' class project. He was intercepted twice, and pulled
from a field on which he so often has had the last word.
</P>
<P>
   A sullen and almost whispering Marino had little to say after
what, conceivably, could have been his last game at Giants Stadium.
That left Jimmy Johnson, the coach who most assuredly wishes him a
happy next life, to bring finality to Miami's third straight defeat
since Marino returned to an 8-2 team after missing six weeks with
an injured shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``You throw interceptions on your end of the field, turn the
ball over,'' Johnson said, spitting out his thinly veiled critique.
``The last three or four years, it's been that way. It's nothing
new.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an old story, the Marino-Johnson tension, the uneasy
co-existence, the butting of heads by the legend-in-residence and
power coach who can flash two Super Bowl rings in Marino's baby
blue eyes.
</P>
<P>
   More than ever, for Marino, the Elway ending seems out of the
question. He admitted last week as much. Elway was fortunate enough
to find Terrell Davis in his backfield in the twilight of his
career. Marino took on the Jets Sunday with his wing and a prayer,
with no discernable running game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually,'' Johnson lied, ``the running game wasn't the
problem today.''
</P>
<P>
   It has always been the problem for Marino in Miami. No one in
the history of the National Football League has thrown for more
touchdowns, more completions and yards. Johnson has provided him
one of the American Football Conference's better defenses. But
Johnson's machinations to redesign the Dolphins into more of a
running team have been a well-intentioned failure.
</P>
<P>
   Though injuries have played a part this season, it is of little
consolation to Marino at this point in his career. All he knows is
that the Dolphins have played 13 games, and run for fewer than 100
yards in nine of them. They managed a grand total of 69 Sunday.
They average about 90 a game. For the tenth time since Marino's
rookie season in 1983, they will have a different player lead them
in total yards rushing.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Martin had 75 all by himself, and the threat of Martin at
the line of scrimmage loosened up Miami's secondary, where nine
different Jets were on the receiving end of Lucas' 22 completions.
Johnson caught 11 of them, giving him 21 in his last two games. He
talks a lot of stuff and catches a lot of balls. The 24-yard catch
in the left corner of the end zone on the Lucas rollout following
his one-play absence gave the Jets a 19-13 lead with 9 and a half
minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in Harrison, N.J., and knows all about Marino's
history of comebacks, about the fake-spike game here against the
Pete Carroll's Jets. There was, it turned out, nothing to worry
about Sunday. Marino didn't have the old zip on the ball, what he
had last week, when he chased Peyton Manning into the final seconds
of a 37-34 defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't play very well,'' Marino said. ``I didn't do what we
needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas will never be Marino, that much we know. His team isn't
going anywhere and Parcells won't even say he's guaranteed himself
a backup job when Vinny Testaverde returns next year. But Lucas
beat a legend Sunday, the way he beat Drew Bledsoe and Doug Flutie
last month. A season that has been something of a nightmare for
Parcells has become his fantasy, hard knocks be damned.

STRIKE? SOME NEW YORK CITY TRANSIT WORKERS NOT SO SURE
</HEADLINE>
   (With NY-TRANSIT-TALKS) 
(rk) 
 By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ All afternoon Sunday, conductors and train operators
filed in and out of the crew room overlooking the subway platform
on Coney Island. It was the usual routine. Some of the men squeezed
in a quick game of pool before heading off to make their run on the
D line. Several paused by the television to curse and cheer the
Giants, or they warmed up leftovers in the microwave for a quick
meal.
</P>
<P>
   Days before the deadline for a transit strike, with City Hall
making elaborate plans to avert a traffic disaster, there was
little sense of urgency or crisis among these rank-and-file workers
in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Few voiced much enthusiasm for a strike, and several said that
for all their grievances against the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority, they were uncertain about the judgment of their union
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to do what's best for the union, but I also want to pay
my bills,'' said Gilbert Bowen, a train operator, expressing an
ambivalence shared by many in this crew room.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my heart of hearts,'' said Ronald J. Randall, another train
operator, ``I think we'll lose more if we strike.''
</P>
<P>
   Among transit workers and riders alike Sunday, there was a deep
suspicion that the charged talk of strike preparations was simply
bargaining-table bluster, that both sides have too much to lose by
failing to reach an agreement. Negotiations continued Sunday
without any breakthroughs, though representatives of both sides
reported that their differences over wages had narrowed.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has threatened to seek crippling fines
against the union if it proceeds with what he has said would be an
illegal strike. Yet the city can ill-afford a massive transit
strike just weeks before Christmas and New Year's Eve. ``I believe
it's not going to happen,'' said Dinesh Patel, proprietor of a
newsstand at the 34th Street station. ``At the last minute they are
going to negotiate.''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations did resume Sunday. Still, there was no shortage of
concern Sunday among commuters.
</P>
<P>
   Tim O'Hara, an investment banker in New York City, said he would
leave town before 12:01 a.m. Wednesday, referring to the deadline
set by Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union, which represents
33,000 bus and subway workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't be able to get a cab, you won't be able to get a
car,'' O'Hara said. ``And the way the city works, it will probably
become the basis for a taxi demonstration.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some riders expressed sympathy for the union's
demands. They know that there has been a substantial increase in
ridership, and, they reason, transit workers certainly deserve to
share in the fruits of success. Rachel Shtier, a writer from
Brooklyn, said the union's wage demand, a pay raise of as much as
27 percent over three years, ``seems like a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``But on the other hand, the MTA is making so much
money _ why not pay those guys?''
</P>
<P>
   It this precise argument that was made over and over in the crew
room at the Coney Island subway station Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that things are going well, we just want to catch up with
the rest of the world,'' said Eddie G. Campbell, a train operator.
``We are a vital part of this city, so give us our due.''
</P>
<P>
   They talk of past contracts in which, they say, they were
tricked or out-maneuvered by management. They recite the
concessions they made during the lean years, years during which
they sometimes went without raises.
</P>
<P>
   The public, they say, has little appreciation of either the jobs
they perform or the abuse they sometimes endure. Someone raises the
subject of spitting. ``I've gotten spit at twice,'' one conductor
said. ``I've been spit at,'' another man said. ``Me, too,'' said a
third, and then a fourth.
</P>
<P>
   This, in turn, leads to a quick cataloging of all the things
that have been thrown at them. Batteries. Soda cans. A jug of
lemonade. Some people, it seems, get a little crazy when the subway
train leaves without them. ``This is what these kids do!'' said
Richard Bass, a conductor.
</P>
<P>
   Their contempt for management is written plainly _ on their
faces, and over the toilets in the crew room bathroom. They
complain of a ``guilty-until-proven-innocent'' disciplinary system
in which employees are suspended without pay for ``petty stuff.''
They tell stories of a train operator who got in trouble for
wearing a baseball cap, and another who was disciplined for wearing
a sweatshirt over his uniform on a cold day.
</P>
<P>
   ``They discipline us, they harass us and they forget that it's
up to us to move the people of New York City,'' said Victor
Huggins, a train operator.
</P>
<P>
   It would seem an atmosphere ripe for labor unrest, except that
many of the men and women interviewed Sunday seemed to possess a
tenuous connection at best with their union leadership. They
complained about a lack of communication from their union
representatives, saying that most of what they know comes from the
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't trust them, and we don't trust the MTA,'' said Sal
Pillitteri, a train operator.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Huggins said: ``We hear more rumors than anything else. We never
hear from the union. You don't see representatives in here telling
us what is going down.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many of the workers are reluctant to commit
themselves one way or another on the subject of striking. They say
they will wait for the general membership meeting scheduled for
Tuesday before deciding whether to support calls for a strike.
</P>
<P>
   Threats from Mayor Rudolph Giuliani are also weighing on the
minds of some transit workers.
</P>
<P>
   Several men said they were furious at Giuliani for implying that
members of the union may have sabotaged the Eighth Avenue subway
line by activating a switch that moves local trains to the express
track. Giuliani said the union would be held accountable for any
acts of vandalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's doing it on purpose just to get the riding public
against us,'' Pillitteri said. ``I mean, it could have been caused
by anything: bad switches, bad signals, bad tracks. I don't think
anyone from our side would ever do something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The dominant sentiment in this crew room favored compromise over
confrontation. The workers know they will not see annual raises of
9 percent _ ``Hey, it's like plea bargaining; you got to start
high,'' one conductor said with a chuckle _ but they do not want to
walk away empty-handed, disrespected and in retreat.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wants to go out on strike, but no one wants to be
ripped off either,'' Alexander Wolfe said. ``I don't want to get
hung by management, but I don't want to get hung by the union
either.''

WORKERS START TEARING DOWN CHARRED WAREHOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WORCESTER, Mass. _ By Sunday morning, the out-of-town
firefighters had departed, the camera crews had left, and the men
of F&AMP;D Trucking Co. were left alone to do what they have been
itching to do all week: make the Worcester Cold Storage and
Warehouse Co. buildingisappear.
</P>
<P>
   A wrecking ball tapped at one of the warehouse's three standing
walls, breaking the structure into 3,000-pound chunks that toppled
and crashed down. Nicholas DiLiddo, one of F&AMP;D's owners, arrived at
the scene Dec. 3 after the blaze and worked 60 hours straight as he
dismantled the building from the inside, to avoid further burying
the six men who died in the inferno.
</P>
<P>
   At 9:30 p.m. Saturday, the remains of the last firefighter _
Paul Brotherton, 41 _ were removed. And DiLiddo could finally give
the Worcester firefighters what they wanted. ``They said, `Nick, go
get it. We want it out of here. It was a hellhole,' '' DiLiddo
said.
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday night, the wall nearest Route 290 had been almost
demolished, allowing the expressway to reopen. So far, funerals for
three of the firefighters are scheduled this week: James Lyons's is
Monday, Joseph McGuirk's Tuesday, and Lieutenant Thomas Spencer's
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The demolition team has a formidable target in the warehouse,
which was built in 1906 and used for years by the Chicago Dressed
Beef Co. Susan Willett, who took a job in the building in 1968,
when she was 20, recalled an antic workplace where oxtails were
comic props and she was forever throwing her coat on and ducking
through sides of beef.
</P>
<P>
   But since the deadly fire, the building contains few good
memories. Betty Haddad came Sunday to watch the demolition, with
tears streaming down her face. ``It's much too sad to look at,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even weakened by the fire, it will fall slowly. The walls are 3
1/2 feet thick and reinforced with concrete. DiLiddo had passed the
building countless time,but didn't really know it until he took his
4,500-pound wrecking ball to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave it one god slap and the ball just went, dunk. When I
hit that building I knew it was going to be a fight all the way,''
he said. Do not mistake that respect for admiration, he said.
``There is nothing I like about that building at all.''

ANALYSIS: THE QUAGMIRE OF LOBBY-LAW REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ For years, when self-styled good-government
groups have wanted to tighten New York's lax restrictions on
lobbyists or campaign fund-raising, the Democrats who control the
Assembly have been their most sympathetic audience. Bills have been
introduced, and occasionally passed, only to die in the
Republican-controlled state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But when those same gadflies applauded Saturday's far-ranging
proposal by Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno to revamp the
lobbying law, a spokeswoman for Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver
said the Democrats were not interested.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic legislators archly suggest that it is easy for Bruno
to play the reformer when he knows his plan will go nowhere. A
similar exchange occurred six months ago, when Gov. George Pataki,
a Republican, made a campaign finance proposal that left critics of
the current system almost giddy with delight, only to have the
Legislature ignore it.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats scoffed that Pataki knew there was no real danger that
his plan would become law.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats insist with some justification that they have
substantive objections to Bruno's lobbying package. Bruno said his
bill would ban nearly all gifts to legislators from lobbyists, but
Democrats asserted that it would not apply to trips to speak to
interest groups, even if those trips were to luxurious resorts; to
gifts from the corporate officers the lobbyists represent; or to
attendance at longstanding events like the Business Council's
annual meeting at a Lake George resort, a Republican favorite.
</P>
<P>
   But now it is the Assembly Democrats who risk looking like the
obstructionists, the false reformers who talk the high-minded talk
and pass bills that are doomed, but back away as soon as their
rivals get serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to begin to question their real support for reform,''
said Barbara Bartoletti, state legislative director for the League
of Women Voters. ``If you are serious about reform, you take these
proposals as a starting point and you talk.''
</P>
<P>
   People close to Bruno acknowledge his political motivation. The
Republicans, who hold the Senate by a 36-to-25 margin, are worried
about next year's elections, and Bruno will do whatever he can to
make his group more popular.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly Democrats, with an overwhelming 98-to-52 advantage
in their house, have less to worry about, and they know it.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, there is little heartfelt support in either house
for reforming the lobbying law, though lawmakers are loath to say
so on the record. While they got a raise this year, to an average
of about $90,000, legislators still enjoy being wined and dined.
</P>
<P>
   ``They view this as a perk of the job,'' said Blair Horner,
legislative director of the New York Public Interest Research
Group. Horner agreed that the onus was now on Silver and refused to
question Bruno's sincerity. ``If I worried about people's motives
in Albany, I would spend all my day thinking about it, and I would
be very unhappy,'' Horner said.
</P>
<P>
   Silver's office declined to comment for the record, but people
close to the speaker said they were aware that the whole episode
could make the Democrats look bad and that he would make his own
counterproposal for reforming the lobbying law.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Pataki has so far managed to have it both ways. He professes
distaste for the current system but does not say how to change it.
But people close to Bruno think the governor will have a hard time
accepting one of the senator's central ideas: that lobbyists should
have to disclose publicly the work they do to influence the
agencies the governor controls, just as they report their
legislative lobbying.
</P>
<P>
   Reform is a relative concept in Albany, where phrases like ``the
slowest,'' ``the most secretive'' and ``the most dysfunctional''
are routinely used to describe lawmaking, and the lobbying law is
among the weakest in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Fundamental change is rare here, and it is usually brought on by
crisis or embarrassment. The legislative ethics law was passed a
decade ago only after scandals brought down some powerful
Democratic legislators. State Republicans changed the notoriously
restrictive ballot-access rules _ and then only marginally _ after
a spate of bad publicity over their efforts to make sure that only
the party favorite, Bob Dole, appeared on the 1996 presidential
primary ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The current debate is no different. Over the summer, The New
York Times reported that Philip Morris' chief lobbyist here had
failed to report hundreds of thousands of dollars in lobbying
expenses, as required by state law. When those expenses were
disclosed last month, it turned out that they mainly involved gifts
like expensive dinners and theater tickets to scores of
legislators. It also appeared that many lawmakers broke the law in
accepting those gifts.
</P>
<P>
   The State Lobbying Commission hit Philip Morris with the largest
fine in the commission's history, $75,000 _ a paltry sum for a
giant corporation. Critics of the current law clamored for change.
</P>
<P>
   The current lobbying law expires on Dec. 31, so the Legislature
is expected to do something, if only to extend the law as is. The
Legislature might convene this week for a special session on health
care proposals, and lobbying could be on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The people who truly want change hold out hope that Bruno is
playing a game of chicken, and that Silver will not want to leap
first. But years of experience have taught them that each house
could adopt a different plan, that the two could fail to agree on
changes and that all 211 legislators could then run for re-election
next year while proclaiming, ``I voted for lobbying reform.''

STEPHEN KELLEHER, 84, PRIEST WHO WROTE ON MARRIAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Monsignor Stephen Kelleher, who gained wide attention
in 1968, when, as presiding judge of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese
of New York's marriage tribunal, he urged the church to abolish
such courts and allow Catholics greater freedom to remarry, died on
Dec. 5 at a church residence in Manhattan. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   His statement, published as an article in the Jesuit magazine
America, appeared as church jurisprudence regarding marriage was
undergoing a gradual change, but before those changes were formally
incorporated into church law. Since 1983, when the code of canon
law was revised, church courts have broadened the grounds on which
a marriage may be declared invalid, allowing a larger number of
Catholics to remarry in the church.
</P>
<P>
   Although the church does not recognize divorce (and bars those
who have remarried without its permission from receiving
Communion), its courts can grant annulments, declaring a marriage
invalid in a sacramental sense, null from its beginning, for
reasons ranging from impotence or coercion to various states of
``psychological incapacity.'' About 60,000 annulments are granted
each year.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1968, when Kelleher wrote his article, such decisions
were far rarer. In many dioceses, marriage courts handled few
cases. Some canon lawyers even warned that ``a system of
underground tribunals'' was developing, as younger priests
remarried divorced Catholics without formal permission.
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher wrote that the church's procedures for dealing with
failed marriages were outdated and marred by a ``lack of Christian
love and compassion.''
</P>
<P>
   In considering whether a marriage had been consummated, the
church placed too much emphasis on the physical dimension of that
question, while ignoring the psychological issue of whether ``a
substantial, fully personal relationship'' had developed between
husband and wife, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He recommended scrapping the tribunals and allowing Catholics in
``intolerable'' marriages to judge by their own consciences whether
they were free before God to remarry. He proposed that the church
set up commissions, led by lay people, to guide Catholics in such
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher brought long experience on church courts to his
arguments. He was ordained a priest in 1940, and he received a
doctorate in canon law from the Catholic University of America in
Washington in 1943. He was appointed that year to the marriage
tribunal in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But after the article appeared, Cardinal Terence Cooke, New
York's archbishop, removed him from the court and appointed him
administrator of a parish in Scarsdale.
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher took the transfer with good grace, saying the cardinal
never tried to prevent him from stating his views. ``We're good
friends,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. David O'Connell, president of Catholic University, said
in an interview on Friday that what Kelleher did ``was bring the
whole notion of annulments into the public eye.'' But O'Connell
added that changes in how church courts deal with annulments took
effect fully only after the canon-law code was revised.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Kelleher was born in the Bronx on Aug. 31, 1915, a son
of Stephen and Margaret Kelleher. He studied at St. Joseph's
Seminary in the Bronx and at the North American College in Rome.
From 1959 to 1960, he served as assistant director of the Catholic
Near East Welfare Association, and from 1960 to 1962, as a staff
member of Pontifical Mission for Palestine, in Beirut, Lebanon,
work for which he was honored by King Hussein of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   He served the Scarsdale parish until 1972, and then was
appointed to parishes in Manhattan. He retired in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by three nieces and one nephew.

HIKERS, STRANDED OVERNIGHT, FIND THEIR WAY TO SAFETY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KERA RITTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two hikers emerged safely from a trail on Mount Washington in
New Hampshire Sunday morning after driving snow and
125-mile-an-hour wind gusts forced them to spend the night under
railroad tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Byron Arnao, 35, of Glen Rocks, N.J., and Victor Barres, 35, of
Hasbrouck Heights, N.J., stumbled into the summit weather
observatory at 7:30 a.m., as a team of rescuers from the New
Hampshire Fish and Game Department headed up the mountain searching
for them, uncertain of their fate.
</P>
<P>
   Both were in good condition and were transported down the
mountain Sunday, said Sarah Curtis, a meteorologist at the
observatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have gone either way,'' Curtis said. ``People weren't
exactly sure how prepared they were, where they were located, or
exactly what their condition was. People have perished in a lot
better and survived in a lot worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The men, both moderately experienced hikers, drove all night
Friday and started hiking up the Jewell Trail about 10 a.m.
Saturday. The summit is 6,288 feet, the highest peak in the
Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   About 5:30 p.m. the men called 911 on a cellular phone and said
they were in trouble. The temperature had dipped to 20 degrees.
Almost 10 inches of snow had fallen. Wind gusts of 125 miles an
hour were knocking them over, and visibility was zero.
</P>
<P>
   Although they were just 100 feet from the summit observatory,
they could not see it.
</P>
<P>
   The Appalachian Mountain Club called them back and advised they
head back down the mountain, but the men reported they were unable.
</P>
<P>
   By 7:30 p.m., Fish and Game decided conditions were too severe
to launch a rescue and advised the men hunker down below the tree
line. The two said they were unable to make it and crawled into a
space two feet high under the Cog Railroad, wrapping up in their
sleeping bags. A steam engine runs up the tracks during the warmer
months carrying tourists.
</P>
<P>
   One of the men then called his wife to report their location and
said they would not be rescued that night.
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday morning, conditions had improved and the hikers
followed the light on the observatory tower to safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a little surprised to see them when they stumbled into
the building,'' Curtis said. ``Fish and Game had started up the
mountain at 5 a.m., so we expected them all to come up or we would
head down.''
</P>
<P>
   Both were exhausted but neither needed medical attention, Curtis
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One was shivering but we gave them hot Tang and that subsided
quickly,'' Curtis said. ``They gave them dry clothes and they were
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the men had food, water, sleeping bags, and heavy
coats, Curtis said they were unprepared and lucky to be alive.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis said increasing numbers of hikers are relying on cellular
phones instead of proper planning. Inexperienced climbers often
gain a false sense of security and later find themselves in trouble
when darkness falls or weather conditions change.
</P>
<P>
   As in the situation Saturday night, rescuers cannot always reach
hikers immediately, and the risk of death and injury increases. ``A
cell phone is not insurance,'' Curtis said.
</P>
<P>
   The two New Jersey hikers did not heed a wind advisory that
caused several hikers to turn around, including a tour group with
reservations at the summit observatory. One of the men was wearing
three-season leather boots instead of mountain boots. They did not
have a tent, stove, or wind- and water-resistant covers for their
sleeping bags, all necessities, Curtis said.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures at the summit are often 30 degrees colder than at
valley level, with strong wind gusts. Several hikers have died on
the mountain, and each year others become stranded after changes in
the weather.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 124 fatalities on and around Mount Washington
since 1849, many of them involving ill-prepared hikers, skiers, and
climbers. Steve Carmody, 29, of Danbury, Conn., was the last
fatality on the mountain. He fell to his death on Sept. 27, 1997.

DODGERS WITHOUT A CLUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the Los Angeles Dodgers have a plan, it's seriously
encrypted. Hackers who can tap into the Pentagon's X-Files and
download Bill Gates' memos would be stumped by the Dodgers'
well-cloaked strategy. If the Germans had access to the Dodgers'
system during World War II, we'd all be eating schnitzel.
</P>
<P>
   The only discernible surface clue to all of their moves is a
faint outline of the domino theory -- every action relates to the
previous action.
</P>
<P>
   But this couldn't be. The Dodgers have been a major league
franchise for more than a century. Their ``plan'' couldn't possibly
be this simple-minded, right?
</P>
<P>
   Right?
</P>
<P>
   One has to wonder. Sunday's trade of Ismael Valdes and Eric
Young to the Chicago Cubs won't break many hearts in Los Angeles.
Valdes usually became faint at the mere sight of the eighth inning,
and Davey Johnson had no use for Young. Eric's a sweetheart, but
Johnson hated his bad footwork in the field and didn't put much
value on his stolen bases.
</P>
<P>
   But this trade doesn't solve any problems, other than financial.
The Dodgers got one major league pitcher in the deal, reliever
Terry Adams, who is often wild and just a setup man.
</P>
<P>
   No, this trade is just the latest reactionary move that can be
traced back to May of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Foxies can't sign Mike Piazza, so they trade him and the
underrated Todd Zeile for a kettle of fish, including Gary
Sheffield, a player with the kind of contract ($10 million a year,
six years) Piazza wanted. Only one player remains from that deal,
Sheffield.
</P>
<P>
   -- Deluded into thinking they could win despite having traded
their best player, prospects leave in exchange for veterans
requiring new, expensive contracts, Jeff Shaw, Mark Grudzielanek
and Carlos Perez.
</P>
<P>
   -- Davey Johnson is hired, demands a left-handed hitter, so
Charles Johnson and Roger Cedeno go to New York for the damaged
Todd Hundley. Elderley (37 this month) switch-hitter Devon White is
given a three-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   -- Dodgers throw money at Kevin Brown. Team chooses not to
resign the rehabilitating Ramon Martinez, removing vital Latin
security blanket in the locker room. Dave Mlicki, obtained for
Hideo Nomo, is given away for one of the Marx brothers, Checo.
</P>
<P>
   -- Mondesi goes Krakatoa, leading to the trade for the
appropriately named Shawn Green, leading to salary dumping of
Valdes and Young.
</P>
<P>
   Since this descent began, six pitchers have been traded or
dumped -- Martinez, Hideo Nomo, Mlicki (obtained for Nomo), Dennis
Reyes, Ted Lilly and now Valdes -- and only three remain from the
1998 opening day roster, Chan Ho Park, Darren Dreifort and the
injured Antonio Osuna.
</P>
<P>
   That's mind-numbing, because pitching wasn't considered a
weakness until these changes began. Only one pitcher obtained in
those deals has contributed, closer Jeff Shaw. The Dodgers were
forced to get 347 innings of work last season from the firm of
Arnold, Bochtler, Borbon, Checo, Maddux (not Greg), Masaoka, Mills
and Rojas. This doesn't include some of the rookies who will now
compete for Valdes' starting job -- Eric Gagne, Matt Herges, Mike
Judd, Jeff Kubenka and Jeff Williams.
</P>
<P>
   And the Dodgers may not be done dealing, either. They're still
considering deals for Dreifort, and they'll know by Christmas if
Adrian Beltre will stay under their tree or leave without
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to say things have been choatic and leave it at that.
But G.M. Kevin Malone has been on watch long enough to bear some
burden. He may have been shrewd keeping the Expos afloat, but he's
drowning in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   He was badly abused by two agents, Scott Boras in the Brown deal
and Jeffrey Moorad in the Green-Mondesi trade, and the Mets
suckered him into taking the damaged Hundley. Now he's let Mlicki,
Valdes and Young go without compensation.
</P>
<P>
   He also lacks vision.
</P>
<P>
   If we are indeed in a transient player era, where the five-year
plan is anachronistic and a dynasty is back-to-back playoff visits,
then why didn't Malone step boldly into this new world instead of
straddling it?
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners, staring at losing both Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex
Rodriguez after this season, are accepting trade offers but won't
let any interested teams negotiate a contract beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   That's a major obstacle ... unless your team hasn't won a
post-season game since 1988 and is going to lead the league in
salary anyway. If Malone and the Dodgers are serious about winning
now, they should have called the Mariners and asked them exactly
what they wanted for both future Hall of Famers.
</P>
<P>
   Two starting pitchers, Valdes and Dreifort? Fine. Some prospects
who can play soon, like catcher Angel Pena and shortstop Mike
Metcalfe? Done, pick anyone in the system except Chin-Feng Chen.
Two more young pitchers? Great, pick two from the above list. A few
young vets to fill some holes? Sure, take Young, Mark Grudzielanek
and Todd Hollandsworth.
</P>
<P>
   Not enough? OK, throw in Todd Hundley and Devon White, and we'll
cover the last year of their deals.
</P>
<P>
   What's the worse that could happen? Another 77-85 season?
Another year without a playoff? A payroll that could circle the
globe? So what if the Dodgers crack the $100 million barrier in
payroll? Other teams already hate the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   And even if Griffey and Rodriguez happen to make L.A. a one-year
layover enroute to becoming the first player-owner elsewhere,
wouldn't it be worth a shot? I'm guessing the fan base in town
would step up to the plate at a rate of 45,000 a game, and buy a
jersey or two.
</P>
<P>
   I'd also guess Griffey and A-Rod would kind of dig the scene
themselves. They would arrive with a one-item agenda: Win a World
Series. Now. No regrets thereafter. Plan to move on? Thanks for the
visit, it was real.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey and A-Rod in the same lineup with Eric Karros, Shawn
Green, Gary Sheffield and maybe Beltre. Platoons elsewhere. Brown,
Park and a combo of rookies and journeymen in the rotation, and
Shaw to close. Let's see how they like that in San Francisco and
San Diego, and who cares what Brian Sabean and Kevin Towers have to
say?
</P>
<P>
   Alas, no one in Dodger Blue has this kind of vision. Instead,
the team will forge ahead with the current plan -- size up the hole
the last move has created, and then dig a deeper hole.

APPARENT IMPROVEMENT IN AUTISTIC CHILDREN HAS PARENTS PUSHING FOR
FURTHER DRUG STUDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JODIE SNYDER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (PHOENIX0 - Days after her first secretin injection last year,
Rebecca David slept until 7:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   It was a remarkable development for a girl who for years had
been rousing her parents at 4 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca's family, along with several dozen others in the Phoenix
area, called the Southwest Autism Research Center in Phoenix with
the good news: Their autistic children were sleeping better, eating
better, communicating more easily.
</P>
<P>
   The parents attributed the differences to secretin, a drug they
hoped would help free their children from &UR; autism, a developmental
disorder that has baffled researchers for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   There was only one problem: Almost all the 30 Phoenix area
children in the yearlong clinical trial of secretin reported great
results _ even though a third had received a placebo.
</P>
<P>
   Because the center's study was double-blinded, neither
researchers nor parents knew who got the real secretin until the
end.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the old familiar sadness returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we broke the code (to find who received the real
injections), we were stunned,'' said Dr. Cindy Schneider. There was
no correlation between who got the drug and who improved.
</P>
<P>
   A study published in Thursday's, Dec. 9, New England Journal of
Medicine echoed the Phoenix center's findings: No difference
between placebos and secretin.
</P>
<P>
   The results convinced the National Institutes of Health to
recommend halting the use of secretin until more tests can be done.
Doctors expressed concern that children could be getting dangerous
doses.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; But researchers and parents say it's not over yet.
</P>
<P>
   Secretin has helped too many children improve for them to stop
using it, they say.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Secretin is a pancreatic-stimulating hormone produced by the
small intestine. It is only approved by the Food and Drug
Administration for tests of the digestive system.
</P>
<P>
   But when an autistic New Hampshire boy made startling progress
last year after receiving it, parents nationwide began begging for
it for their autistic children.
</P>
<P>
   The interest prompted U.S. researchers to begin controlled
tests. The study in Phoenix, which began a year ago, is one of a
dozen being conducted across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The New England Journal study, which also was double-blinded,
involved 60 children who were given either secretin or placebos and
tested four weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider and others say the tests may have been flawed. For
example, neither study tested large amounts of secretin: The
Phoenix study gave children the amount of secretin produced after
one meal. Because it was a preliminary test, researchers wanted to
find out if it was safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like 15 diabetics who get a shot of insulin. And there's
no impact,'' Schneider said. ``That doesn't mean there is no hope
in the potential to be of benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   But future tests could be in jeopardy. Schneider worries that
investors will become jittery and will be reluctant to back
Repligen Inc., the company that holds secretin's patent. Repligen
and the center are in negotiations for more tests.
</P>
<P>
   And without more tests, desperate parents will still find ways
to get the drug. ``The trouble is, they will be using them without
proper clinical trials,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider said the center has gotten calls from 500 parents,
some as far away as Australia, who want to participate in further
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Brittany Done of Carefree, for example, is resolved to get
another injection for her son Alex, 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've read the studies, and I'm not impressed. I saw what I
saw, and I know this helped my son.''
</P>
<P>
   After the first injection, her son's diarrhea stopped. He
started sleeping eight hours a night rather than in two-hour
snatches. He blurted out new words: purple, dog, cat.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, he started to look her in the eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like `Oh, there you are. I see you now,' '' his mother
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teachers didn't know he was on the drug, but they called
me up to ask me what was going on. He was so much more focused and
paying attention.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Done wants that little boy back, and despite what researchers
say, she said, she will get him more secretin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not letting this drop,'' she said. ``This is just way too
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Both of Karen Jason's children, Rebecca, now 9, and Sean, now 7,
were in the trials. The two Phoenix children got their first dose
of secretin in November 1998. They got a second dose in June.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Weeks after the first injection, both children seemed
different. Rebecca slept through the night; Sean went to bed
earlier and seemed more interested in people.
</P>
<P>
   During Rebecca's birthday party in July, Sean helped her open
gifts _ a far cry from the boy who had seemed oblivious just a few
weeks before when his big sister screamed during her injections.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, however, Rebecca has returned to her nocturnal ways,
rising before daybreak. She walks around with her fingers and toes
crossed for stimulation.
</P>
<P>
   She does what her mother calls ``eeee-runs,'' in which she
charges, her head tilted down, arms flapping, and crying,
``Eeeee!''
</P>
<P>
   The kids at her new special school tease her, but the
fourth-grader doesn't notice. She's still never been invited to a
birthday party.
</P>
<P>
   She does seem to have developed a sense of humor, though. Making
human-body noises now gives her the giggles.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother said she worked all year to find her daughter's funny
bone. ``She knows to laugh, but maybe she still doesn't know why
it's funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason believes her son, Sean, is different in other ways. He
still engages in ``video talk'' _ using lines from movies to
communicate _ but now he'll grab a person's hand and give stage
direction as if he wants company in a private production.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hallelujah,'' he'll tell them.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a year of big change for Jason. She got a divorce and
received custody of the children. Rebecca and Sean _ usually
sensitive to changes in routine _ seem OK with the differences, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just keep going along,'' Jason said. ``Sometimes day by
day.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Mary O'Neal &UR; of Scottsdale, the days since the injections
have been ``two steps forward and three steps back.''
</P>
<P>
   Although secretin didn't seem to affect her son, Evan, 4, he did
change _ just as any child changes over the course of a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He still isn't saying anything. He won't make eye contact,''
his mother said. ``But he can tell when something's different in
the room.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, O'Neal's younger son has been diagnosed with delayed
speech. At 20 months, Tim has the ability of a 10-month-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctors told me that whatever it is, it's not autism,''
Mary O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   She remains determined to teach Evan to communicate. In addition
to the picture cards they used last year, they're trying sign
language. It could take hundreds of tries before Evan learns to
communicate one word, his mother said.
</P>
<P>
   That's a far cry from the instant gratification offered by
secretin, which O'Neal and other parents literally wrestled their
kids into receiving.
</P>
<P>
   Although grateful for being in the study, Mary O'Neal now
believes that the only miracles will come incrementally, day by
day.
</P>
<P>
   The hard way.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this, you always have to have one foot in reality,'' she
said. ``You can be hopeful. For your own sanity, you have to be
hopeful. But you have to be realistic.'' &QL;

much as they could about him. Their only constraints were to stay
within the confines of the law and to avoid asking his family or
friends for help. Bailey was thoroughly surprised by how much of
his personal information was available by through the Internet.

global communications, media and entertainment group. This year,
Goldman has been an adviser on $239 billion of telecommunications
mergers in Europe. That represents an almost fourfold increase over

to propel it from No. 11 to No. 1 on the list of bankers in
European telecommunications mergers. (Jeffrey A. Salter/The New

Terry Shepperd examines a door for a Boeing 737, tail No. N-1383.
The managing director of United Airlines' maintenance center,
Frederick L. Mohr, calls N-1383 a ``pretty good airplane.'' Still,
the N-1383 in question needed about 50 changes, plus extensive
routine maintenance. N-1383 has been inspected and modified several
times because of the discovery of flaws in fuel tank wiring in
other 737s, in inspections brought on by the explosion of the TWA
747, Flight 800, after it took off from Kennedy Airport in New York
in July 1996. (Mary Ann Carter/The New York Times)

Frederick L. Mohr, managing director of United Airlines'
maintenance center, examines new radar for a Boeing 737, tail No.
N-1383. Altough updates of equipment on passenger jets are routine,
the plane's maintenance report over the past month formed a
computer printout about 15 feet long, and the Federal Aviation
Administration, in response to airplane crashes, had demanded that
United Airlines, the plane's operator, install a better flight data
recorder and a firefighting system in the cargo holds. In all, the
plane needed about 50 changes, plus extensive routine maintenance.

   (NYT5) WASHINGTON -- Dec. 12, 1999 -- KOSKINEN-PROFILE -- John
A. Koskinen will be keeping a close eye on the changeover to 2000.
Koskinen, who holds the formal title of chairman of President
Clinton's Council on Year 2000 Conversion is better known around
the White House as Clinton's Y2K czar. ``I'll be in the middle of
all sorts of stuff.'' At 11:59 and 59 seconds on the night of Dec.
31, Koskinen says, he will be stone sober and seated in a specially
built glass-walled war room in downtown Washington, where a staff
of more than 100 will keep watch on the global changeover to a new
year, a new century, a new millennium. (Paul Hosefros/The New York

RUSSIA-CHECHNYA -- Sergei Shoigu, Russia's minister for emergency
situations and the leader of a Kremlin-backed party in next
weekend's parliamentary elections, trying to arrange the evacuation
of refugees from Grozny on Saturday. The ostensible purpose was to
inaugurate a new humanitarian corridor for the thousands of
civilians trapped in the city, which Russian forces have pounded
for weeks. Although the search for fleeing refugees proved
unsuccessful, Shoigu pledged his undying efforts to help save
civilian lives. (James Hill/The New York Times Photo)

   (NYT3) NEW YORK -- Dec. 12, 1999 -- ECOMMERCE-WRONG-PRICES --
Don Blate, right, a Brookstone area manager, helped a customer on
the phone find a product on the company's Web site. Brookstone
relies on a team of employees to verify that prices posted online
are correct. When a pricing error does occur on a Brookstone site,
a situation that has yet to happen, Brookstone ``will appeal to the
reasonable expectations of our customers,'' says Michael Anthony,
chief executive of Brookstone, adding that ``most people are
reasonable.'' ``It also helps that we have one price on our items,
no matter how you buy them, so there's less of a chance of a

Skinner, left, and Alice Ripley, center, in a September rehersal of
``James Joyce's 'The Dead,''' the musical adaptation of the Joyce
short story at the Belasco Theater. Ms. Ripley plays Miss Molly
Ivors, a spunky Irish lass whose flirtation raises the body
temperature of Gabriel Conroy, the play's central character, played
by Christopher Walken. Ms. Skinner, meanwhile, is Mary Jane, a
kindly niece whose Christmas celebration sets the scene for the
play. The two characters never speak directly to each other.(Sara

   (NYT1) NEW YORK -- Dec. 12, 1999 -- SIDE-SHOW-ACTORS-1 -- Emily
Skinner and Alica Ripley, Siamese Twins in ``Side Show,'' return to
Broadway once again in ``James Joyce's 'The Dead'''. Hint: Ms.
Ripley is seated and at right, in photo at right. It was just two
years ago that Ms. Skinner and Ms. Ripley burst onto Broadway
literally connected at the hip. Though ``Side Show'' lasted only
seven weeks, the Broadway community's mental connection between Ms.
Skinner and Ms. Ripley has endured. And that association is likely
to intensify now that the two find themselves on Broadway again in
``The Dead,'' the musical adaptation of the Joyce short story.

Skinner and Ms. Ripley has endured. And that association is likely
to intensify now that the two find themselves on Broadway again in
``The Dead,'' the musical adaptation of the Joyce short story.

   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ The ladies couldn't throw, at least not as
much as they wanted to, in 40 mph gusts. The wind kept them from
kicking, too. So the New York Sharks, full of adrenaline and
athleticism, used a mean running game to defeat the Minnesota
Vixens, 12-6.
</P>
<P>
   It was a momentous day, especially for the Sharks, a squad that
put on the pads only about three weeks ago. The Vixens, members of
the Women's Professional Football League, have four games under
their belts, and have been on the field since the beginning of
October on a barnstorming tour to gauge the interest in and
audience for what the league advertises as ``high quality smash
mouth tackle football.''
</P>
<P>
   While the cold crowd at the 12,000-seat Mitchel Athletic Complex
here dwindled from just 300 to less than half that after halftime,
the players' enthusiasm was as strong as a blindside tackle,
judging from the post-game euphoria in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something we've wanted to do all our lives,'' said
Lori DeVivio, 30, a wide receiver from Brooklyn. ``We're fulfilling
a fantasy that we never, ever thought would come true.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vixens roster includes a former Olympian _ Wendy Brown, who
was on the 1988 U.S. Olympic track and field team _ plus a NASA
engineer, three police officers and a World Cup rugby player. The
Sharks, who range in age from 25 to 49, include two lawyers, an
electrician and a construction worker known for her aggression.
(``You can see death in her eyes,'' one referee said.)
</P>
<P>
   The New York Sharks have been practicing tackle football for the
last 2 1-2 months, two or three times a week. Most were members of
the Long Island Sharks, a flag football team. In that noncontact
version of the sport, players ``tackle'' one another by pulling off
one of two flags worn on a belt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we get the chance to put on the pads and really hit
someone,'' said Alinda Mitchell, 33, of Harlem, who plays defensive
tackle and is known on the team as Big Dog. In a practice she broke
her leg in three places, and her teammates wear her number, 99, on
their helmets in her honor. Like many Sharks, she prefers tackling
an opponent to pulling a flag off of her.
</P>
<P>
   ``You felt you were holding back,'' she said of playing flag
football.
</P>
<P>
   Members of both teams, who have nicknames like Smackie, Major,
Trigger and Tonka (as in truck), said the padding took getting used
to.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I thought football was a pansy sport, because of the
pads,'' said Jodi Anderson of the Vixens, who played rugby in
college. Now she finds football more painful, because of all the
protective gear: ``The pads cut into your arms. My neck hurt for a
week after wearing this 15-pound helmet.''
</P>
<P>
   Their second-hand equipment comes from semipro and high school
teams, and is often too big. Some of the women gathered the extra
fabric at the bottom of their football pants in knots, for a
snugger fit. Their football is one inch smaller in diameter, for
smaller hands.
</P>
<P>
   Women's football is not a new invention. In 1926, the Frankford
Yellow Jackets _ the forerunners of today's Philadelphia Eagles of
the N FL _ used a women's team as its halftime entertainment. In
1974, the National Women's Football League was formed, with teams
including the Dallas Bluebonnets and the Los Angeles Dandelions; it
expanded with the Philadelphia Queen Bees and the Tulsa Babes,
among other teams, but fell on hard times by the mid 1980s,
according to an essay included in Saturday night's program.
American football for women has fared better internationally, with
leagues in Germany and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Building on the success of women's basketball and women's
soccer, Terry Sullivan, a backer of minor league football teams,
and Carter Turner, the owner of the St. Paul Pigs, the 1999
Mid-America Football League champs, created the Women's
Professional Football League this year. They hope that the league's
teams will generate enough interest to bring sponsors and more
franchises on board.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only two teams _ the Vixens and the Lake Michigan Minx
of Chicago, have played league games, and two other teams, the
Sharks and a team in Dallas, are preparing to join the league. The
players are paid about $100 a game, along with traveling expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the game, the terminology was decidedly old school.
The players were most often ladies, as in, ``Ladies, dives and
options are the same,'' they were coached at halftime. They were
occasionally girls, but never women. ``Girls, ladies, we don't
care. It's all the same,'' Ms. Mitchell said. ``We just want to
play some football.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks played with heart, tackling hard, with defense that
stopped the Vixens cold. Men's games might be faster, cleaner and
sharper, but then some men have been playing football since they
were 4, said Julie Crotty, 35, a spectator from Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Among the fans, who huddled under blankets and quietly cursed
the sun for setting, there were a few who wondered if women's
football would _ or even should _ catch on.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to do football professionally, you need to do flag
football,'' said Portia Lack of Wantagh, 38, a spectator who plays
the nontackle game. ``It sounds bad, but people in general, guys
and gals, still want to see women look like women.'' In flag
football, which requires no bulky equipment, she said, ``You can
see that they're girls, that they have faces and pony tails and
legs.''
</P>
<P>
   What these girls _ or ladies _ had by the end of the hour of
play Saturday were uniforms stained with grass, dirt and blood.
When it was all over, the Sharks' 5-foot 5-inch quarterback, Val
Halesworth, 33, who threw a pass on a 70-yard play for the winning
touchdown, held her helmet in the air and yelled, ``That's
football, ladies!''
</P>
<P>
   Turns out she had been voted Most Valuable Player for four out
of her five seasons on boys' football teams, from age 8 to 14. A
crowd of reporters asked her what happened then.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got breasts, and I didn't think I was supposed to play
football,'' she said. But Saturday night she played both offense
and defense, at one point stripping the ball from the Vixens at the
Sharks goal line and returning it 35 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best day in my life,'' she said as she headed
toward the locker room.

TRIAL BY FIRE FOR UCLA'S WATSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Earl Watson played fabulous defense against
Gonzaga, his first test as UCLA's starting point guard. He also had
eight rebounds, four assists and nine points _ solid numbers for a
floor leader.
</P>
<P>
   But there's only one statistic Watson will remember, only one
that really counts: seven turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played as poorly as I could have,'' Watson said dejectedly
in UCLA's locker room following a 59-43 loss Saturday to Gonzaga.
</P>
<P>
   For the Bruins (3-1) to be the best they can be this season, for
them to challenge for the Pacific-10 title and make an impact in
March, Watson must become a disciplined, dependable point guard. He
must distribute the ball to the right players in the right places.
He must make shrewd decisions on the fast break. And he must bring
order to the chaotic half-court offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earl's the key,'' Bruins forward Rico Hines said. ``We're one
big person, and he's the head. He's got to make sure we run the
offense.''
</P>
<P>
   The body can't function with its head in a daze, and Watson
admitted Saturday that he's struggling without sidekick Baron
Davis, a point guard extraordinaire whose presence enabled Watson
to play off-guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is that last year I'd guard the top (opposing)
guard and I didn't have to play point guard,'' Watson said. ``This
year, I have to guard the top guard and play point. I'm definitely
tired. I've never played point guard.''
</P>
<P>
   For UCLA's sake, he'd better learn fast.
</P>
<P>
   Miss him already: Suspended forward JaRon Rush wouldn't have
helped UCLA's abysmal 3-point shooting against Gonzaga (4 of 26)
because he's a poor long-range shooter himself (26.5 percent last
year, 33.3 this season).
</P>
<P>
   But Rush's specialties are energy and rebounding, and the Bruins
desperately needed both Saturday afternoon. They were outplayed on
the frontline and showed a shocking lack of the spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really miss him,'' Watson said. ``We depend on him so
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Century mark: Saturday was Steve Lavin's 100th game as head
coach. He's 73-27 in a little more than three seasons, with one
Pac-10 title and five NCAA Tournament victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``A hundred games, and I've aged 100 years,'' he said _ and that
was before the Gonzaga disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The week ahead: Because of exams, the Bruins will practice at 5
a.m. this week _ a routine Lavin has used throughout his tenure. It
frees the afternoons and evenings for test-taking and studying, and
it assures the players are in bed at a reasonable hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, it's tough,'' Lavin said of the practices, ``but
once they get going, they're OK. You've got to jump-start them.''
</P>
<P>
   Same old story: Of UCLA's myriad deficiencies, executing against
zone defenses might top the list. Detroit Mercy zoned the Bruins
out of the NCAA Tournament last year, Gonzaga's zone snuffed them
Saturday and they'll probably see zone after zone this season _ at
least until they score against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams are going to zone us,'' Hines said. ``Every shot was
tough (against Gonzaga). We didn't get in the flow.''

2 NEW ARIZONA MONUMENTS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE YOZWIAK  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (PHOENIX) - Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt today, Dec. 13,
will ask President Clinton to unilaterally create four new national
monuments - two in Arizona and two in California - that Congress
has refused to protect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The empty spaces are filling up in the West. We have to
imagine what the Western landscape is going to look like in 50
years and try to anticipate (protections), rather than wait for the
conflicts to happen,'' Babbitt told The Arizona Republic during an
exclusive interview Sunday, Dec. 12.
</P>
<P>
   The former Arizona governor said the two monuments in Arizona
would be:
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument, 1 million acres
northwest of the Grand Canyon that otherwise could be developed &UR; by
mining and subdivisions. This monument across the Shivwits Plateau
would be almost as large as the adjacent 1.1 million-acre Grand
Canyon National Park.
</P>
<P>
   The Agua Fria National Monument, 40,000 acres north of Phoenix
where hundreds of archeological sites are threatened &UR; by urban
sprawl and pot hunters. This monument east of Interstate 17 would
stretch from Black Canyon City to Cordes Junction.
</P>
<P>
   The two California monuments would:
</P>
<P>
   Double to 10,000 acres the existing Pinnacles National Monument,
south of San Jose, which is threatened by urban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   Create the California Costal National Monument, made up of
thousands of small, uninhabited islands and rock outcroppings,
which are threatened by mining.
</P>
<P>
   All four are among the dozen natural features Babbitt has
identified across the West this past year that he intends the
Clinton administration to preserve from development.
</P>
<P>
   In most other cases, Babbitt has successfully enlisted the
cooperation of Republicans and Democrats to advance the protections
through congressional action. Babbitt is working closely, for
example, with U.S. Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., to create a new
national monument southeast of Tucson called the Empire Cienaga.
</P>
<P>
   However, in the case of the four monuments Babbitt will formally
propose to Clinton today, Dec. 13, Republicans in Congress have
failed to act. In the case of the Arizona Strip northwest of the
Grand Canyon, U.S. Rep. Bob Stump, R-Ariz., has actively opposed
Babbitt and pushed instead for more mining, road-building and air
tours across the Shivwits Plateau.
</P>
<P>
   Stump's congressional aide, Lisa Atkins, said her boss was
``extremely disappointed'' and ``surprised'' by Babbitt's plans.
</P>
<P>
   Atkins said there has not been enough time to fully consider
either of the two proposals for Arizona, and the monument planned
next to the Grand Canyon is nearly twice the size Babbitt
originally proposed a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The congressman believes it is not fair to the public . . . to
move ahead with a recommendation at this point,'' said Atkins,
adding that Stump will send a letter to Clinton this week, asking
that the president reject Babbitt's plan.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Gov. Jane Hull joined Stump in denouncing Babbitt's
recommendations. Hull's press secretary Francie Noyes said Sunday,
Dec. 12, that the governor supports the preservation of open space,
but not through a unilateral action of the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor feels strongly that Arizona should be involved in
decisions that affect so much of Arizona. This is not a rejection
of the idea of open space by any means. Rather it's (opposition to)
the process of this particular decision,'' Noyes said.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt said Clinton is expected to act on the recommendations
within the next several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1906 Antiquities Act, pushed through Congress by
then-President Theodore Roosevelt, the president has the unilateral
power to protect federal lands from development by declaring them
national monuments.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used this power in 1996 to create the Grand
Staircase-Escalante National Monument in southern Utah. That move
is credited, in part, for solidifying environmentalists' support
and helping Clinton's re-election that year. The last Republican
president to use the powers of the Antiquities Act was President
Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Clinton's surprise action in 1996, vehemently denounced
by the Utah congressional delegation, Babbitt has hosted numerous
hiking tours and town halls throughout the West during the past
year to generate support for protecting natural places.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado and Oregon, Babbitt said he has garnered bipartisan
support for new national monuments and national parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making good progress in many areas of the West in
getting these consentual approaches to work - but not everywhere,''
Babbitt said.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Stump aggressively challenged Babbitt's plans by
introducing his own Shivwits Plateau National Conservation Area.
</P>
<P>
   ``H.R. 2795 protects the remoteness, native biodiversity and
ecological richness of the Shivwits Plateau, but at the same time
increases public awareness, outdoor recreation-use enjoyment,''
Stump said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt joined environmentalists in denouncing the measure in
testimony before a subcommittee of the House Resources Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt said his own plans would ensure that ranching and
hunting could continue across the Arizona Strip - a sparsely
populated land settled during the past century by Mormon pioneer
ranchers. However, a national monument would prevent uranium miners
and other developers from ruining the natural landscape and fouling
the area's tributaries to the Colorado River, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists criticized Stump's bill because they said it
would allow the spraying of toxic herbicides and bulldozing of
trees and bushes to open up grasslands for local ranchers. And it
would disclose the locations of archaeological sites and delete
proposed wilderness protections from Glen Canyon National
Recreation Area, they said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the 40,000 acres near the Agua Fria River, Babbitt said,
the archeological treasures across Black Mesa and Perry Mesa must
be protected from the Phoenix metro area's relentless advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless we take steps now, the development pressures will
leap-frog onto those mesas and continue right on to Prescott,''
Babbitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Atkins said Stump also recognizes the development pressures from
northern Maricopa County and southern Yavapai County, but wants to
look at a more comprehensive plan that would include the Agua Fria
recreational corridor planned for the West Phoenix area.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the California proposals, Babbitt said legislation to
protect the costal islands and expand Pinnacles National Monument
was introduced, but never received a hearing in the House Resources
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're runing out of time, not for this administration, but in
terms of future growth in the West submerging all these pristine
places,'' Babbitt said. &QL;

BIG BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1999 Special for The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was
the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch
of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of
Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it
was the winter of despair . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``THE SIXTIES'' &QL; 
Richard Avedon &QL; 
(Random House/Kodak, $75) &UR;
</P>
<P>
   It's my pleasure to tell you that Richard Avedon's new book,
``The Sixties,'' begins not with a photographic image but with the
opening paragraph of ``A Tale of Two Cities, words written 140
years ago but so remarkably suited to the edgy chaos of the 1960s
that you'll wonder whether Charles Dickens shared some funny
cigarettes with Abbie Hoffman in another life.
</P>
<P>
   Avedon and his collaborator, Doon Arbus, have put together a
book that shows the decade in all its abrasive and contradictory
glory. Notice the juxtaposition of Rose Kennedy and Janis Joplin
(at opposite ends of the book, each wearing her version of finery
and an eerie frown), Truman Capote displaying his belly button and
Andy Warhol his scars, the stiff stare of Henry Kissinger and the
serene gaze of Cesar Chavez. There's the requisite nudity _ female
breasts are outnumbered, for once, by male genitalia _ and every so
often a splash of color that reminds us that psychedelic was a
household word. It will make you squirm, and it will make you laugh
_ a '60s effect indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other big books you might spend your money on this
Christmas season:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``ILLUSTRATED LETTERS: ARTISTS AND WRITERS CORRESPOND'' &QL; 
Edited by Roselyne de Ayala and Jean-Pierre Gueno (Abrams, $60). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is the art of the handwritten letter taken to grand
heights. The editors have gathered more than 60 letters written by
European artists and authors of the 19th and 20th centuries. Some
are just notes with doodles in the margins. Others are illustrated
with exquisite sketches and watercolor scenes. Among the generous
correspondents: Honore de Balzac, Victor Hugo, Guy de Maupassant,
Arthur Rimbaud, Auguste Rodin, Edouard Manet, Vincent van Gogh,
Paul Gaugin, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Pablo Picasso, Max Jacob
and Antoine de Saint-Exupery. With a foreword by Francine Prose. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``FAY'' &QL; 
William Wegman (Hyperion, $26.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you've grown tired of Wegman's ubiquitous Weimaraners, this
book might pull you back into the fold. The text that accompanies
Wegman's photos of his beloved Fay Ray and her offspring, Battina
(who stayed on after Fay's other puppies went off to new homes),
reminds us that these were DOGS, that in addition to their work
with Wegman _ Fay, especially, knew how to hold a pose _ they
chased balls, hurled themselves into swimming pools, played in the
mud, mated, gave birth and changed their owner's life in ways not
just professional. If there's a dog lover on your Christmas list,
look here. &QL; 
 &QL; 
WOMEN &QL; 
Annie Leibovitz, with an essay by Susan Sontag (Random House,
$75). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Portraits of women, celebrated and obscure. It begins with a
photograph of Leibovitz's mother, then moves on to farmers, maids,
astronauts, soldiers, battered wives, Supreme Court judges,
showgirls and bull riders. More familiar faces are those of
Elizabeth Taylor, architect Maya Lin, writers Eudora Welty and
Jamaica Kincaid, Yoko Ono, Susan Sarandon, Joni Mitchell, Serena
and Venus Williams, Hillary Clinton and Madeleine Albright. It's
worth the price of admission just to see the kind gaze of the late
Osceola McCarty, who worked for 75 years as a Mississippi
washerwoman, then donated $150,000 that she'd saved over her
lifetime to establish a college scholarship for African-American
students in need. &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE ART OF THE MARKET &QL; 
Bob Tamarkin and Les Krantz (ST&AMP;C, $35). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An illustrated history of American business as seen through its
stock certificates. The paper certificates that were proof of
ownership before the days of electronic trading are becoming
financial artifacts with a value of their own. From a terrier named
Prince, who appeared on certificates issued by Farmers Deposit
National Bank in Pittsburgh in the early 1900s (Prince's owner was
the bank president), to the nude woman on certificates for Playboy
Enterprises, Tamarkin and Krantz show how whimsical a marriage of
art and commerce can be. &QL; 
``AND THE CROWD GOES WILD'' &QL; 
Joe Garner (Sourcebooks, $49.95). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The big draw is not the book, which is nothing extraordinary,
but two CDs that offer broadcasts of some of the most memorable
moments in sports. Included are Lou Gehrig saying goodbye to
baseball; Bill Mazeroski's home run in the 1960 World Series; the
Green Bay Packers' win over Dallas in December 1967; Bob Beamon's
long jump in the 1968 Olympics; Secretariat's triumph in the Triple
Crown; the Borg-McEnroe match at Wimbledon in 1980; Tiger Woods'
triumph at the 1997 Masters; Michael Jordan's sixth NBA
championship; and the U.S. women's win in soccer's 1999 World Cup.
With a foreword by Hank Aaron, an afterword by Wayne Gretzky, and
narration by Bob Costas. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``SNAKE'' &QL; 
Chris Mattison (DK, $29.95). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Big, bold pictures of creatures you don't want to find under
your Christmas tree. There are more than 60 individual species from
all over the world in Mattison's ``gallery,'' with information
about environment, anatomy, reproduction, and hunting and feeding.
A starter for would-be herpetologists. &QL; 
``NORMAN ROCKWELL: PICTURES FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE''  &QL; 
(Abrams, $35). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you love the paintings of Norman Rockwell, you can come out
of the closet now. Critics and art historians who previously looked
down their noses at Rockwell are now celebrating his influence on
the American psyche. This book, published in conjunction with the
traveling exhibition of the same name, includes 80 of Rockwell's
paintings, as well as essays not only by curators and historians
but by Robert Coles and Rockwell's son, Peter. The paintings are
anecdotal and as familiar as your own memories. The essays at times
seem like a collective  &UR; mea culpa offered to a man long regarded as
a mere illustrator, and to the people who have admired him for
decades. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``AFRICAN CEREMONIES'' &QL; 
Carol Beckwith and Angela Fisher &UR; Abrams, $150) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This slip-cased, two-volume set weighs 16 pounds, covers 26
countries and contains descriptions and photographs of more than 40
ceremonies, some of which will make you flinch just to think about
them. Spectacularly illustrated, it's the cornerstone of the
authors' effort to document vanishing tribal customs in Africa. &QL; 
``NEW YORK: AN ILLUSTRATED HISTORY'' &QL; 
Ric Burns and James Sanders &UR; (Knopf, $60). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a good deal of strolling on the thin edge of
nothingness. A splattering of fiery particles cascades down from
the torches that the steel workers use for cutting 10-ton girders
in half and for lighting their cigarettes.'' That's how the ``New
York Times'' described the spectacular bravado of the men who built
the Empire State Building in 1930, one of the best stories in this
elegant companion volume to the public television documentary
written and directed by Burns. &QL; 
``EARLY DYLAN'' &QL; 
Photographs by Barry Feinstein, Daniel Kramer and Jim Marshall
(Bulfinch, $35). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It could break your heart, he looks so young and happy. So do
Joan Baez and Mary Travers and even Johnny Cash. They stay that way
within the confines of this slim book, unlike the aging Dylan we
see in Richard Avedon's ``The Sixties.'' This collection of
photographs is a slice of '60s life that skirts the flamboyance and
focuses on a handful of people, their friendships and their music.
With a short foreword by Arlo Guthrie. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``YACHTING'S GOLDEN AGE'' &QL; 
Ed Holm (Knopf, $65) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here are more than 100 glass-plate images documenting yachting's
glory days, from 1880 to 1905. You don't have to know much about
sailing to see that these boats were extraordinary, each a
one-of-a-kind, handcrafted vessel with a unique personality. When
seen from across an expanse of water, they looked, Holm writes,
like ``a flight of giant migrating butterflies,'' their sails
swollen all out of proportion to the tiny crafts below. These
images were made by a handful of pioneering maritime photographers,
who used techniques developed in the years after the Civil War.

<P>
   Brett's 1997 charmer about a cute little hedgehog is freshly
packaged into a gift box with a stuffed toy hedgehog just in time
for the Christmas season.

<P>
   The story centers on Hedgie, who crawls inside a sock that blows

   Four finger puppet characters come with each story, which

Hands off, they say to Morris, who gets a teddy bear.

 Advertising awards posters offensive to some  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A trio of provocative posters sent to area
advertising agencies has sparked a controversy both inside and
outside the industry _ from People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals to the Midwest Transplant Network.
</P>
<P>
   The pieces were created to alert agencies to the upcoming Omni
advertising awards program in February, which are presented
annually by the Advertising Club of Kansas City. The theme of the
pieces: ``What Would You Do For An Omni?''
</P>
<P>
   The posters were designed for the Advertising Club by John
January, Tug McTighe and Paul Diamond, all of Sullivan Higdon &AMP;
Sink in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   According to the trio's interpretation, people would rip off an
award-winning campaign, blow up a kitten in a microwave or give
away a kidney, all to win an Omni.
</P>
<P>
   It's the latter two that have some people up in arms.
</P>
<P>
   January said the premise for the series came from sitting in a
darkened ballroom each year, watching rivals and peers stream to
the podium, receiving awards and accolades.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to say to yourself, `I'd do anything for an
Omni,' &UR; '' January said. ``We thought the examples were so absurd
that they were funny _ our intent was to lampoon the exaggerated
importance that winning a creative award often has.''
</P>
<P>
   The local advertising community, however, is split over the
intent and effectiveness of the pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Courtney, an art director at Bernstein-Rein Advertising,
said he thought the concept was brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to remember, this is a pretty jaded audience that
you're trying to capture the attention of,'' said Courtney, ``and I
certainly think they've done that.''
</P>
<P>
   But for others at least one of the posters is too graphic to be
considered satire.
</P>
<P>
   That one, the last in the series of three, shows a woman
kneeling on the floor of an operating room with her back to the
camera. The hospital gown she's wearing falls away, revealing a
pink-and-purple, freshly-stitched, semi-circle incision.
</P>
<P>
   Near to her is an ice chest, the words ``donor organ''
emblazoned in large red letters. Next to the cooler is a pool of
coagulated blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's really pushing the envelope,'' said Tim Hamill, vice
president and creative director at Bernstein-Rein.
</P>
<P>
   The second poster in the series shows a kitten on a kitchen
counter. A trail of kitty food leads to an open microwave.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Bowers of Lee Bowers Productions was already offended by the
kitten poster. When she received the last mailing, the kidney one,
she threw it to the ground in disgust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was deeply offended,'' Bowers said. ``I certainly wouldn't
give a kidney or blow up my kitten for an Omni.''
</P>
<P>
   And while the posters are intended to be seen only by those in
advertising, others outside the industry are perplexed and put off
by the strategy behind the posters, whether meant for their eyes or
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, people who do organ procurement work hard to
dispel these kinds of myths, that you could sell your kidney and it
ends up having a negative impact on the rate of donation,'' said
Myra Christopher, CEO of the Midwest Bioethics Center in Kansas
City.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Francis, spokeswoman for the Midwest Transplant Network,
said such depictions are disheartening to those in her field and
those who have donated or received a kidney.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a slap in the face,'' Francis said. ``If the
public sees this, or even your own set of colleagues, they get the
wrong information.''
</P>
<P>
   As for PETA's reaction on the kitten being enticed into the
microwave, that organization's spokesman said he was shaking his
head in disgust.
</P>
<P>
   ``People actually microwave animals, cats and dogs, to get their
kicks, so (this) glorifies a real-life tragedy,'' said Dan Matthews
of PETA in Norfolk, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``Secondly, I think it sort of shows when you've run out of
creativity you start getting a little destructive to get some
attention,'' Matthews said. ``Children do it all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Butterworth, a Los Angeles psychologist, said the premise
of the posters doesn't surprise him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Notoriety is everything,'' Butterworth said. ``Remember, shock
value only has the ability to shock for a certain amount of time
and then we become numb to it, so you have to move on to the next
level.''
</P>
<P>
   And while the call for entries is aimed at advertising peers,
these are the same people who create ads for the masses,
Butterworth said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can get away with a little more here just because of
their audience, but you see the same type of shock ads made for
general audiences, too,'' Butterworth said.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent call for Omni entries is only the latest in a
number of controversial ones, the most recent of which was two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That one showed the actual Omni, a white sphere encased in
Lucite. Trying to penetrate the Lucite to get at the ovum-like Omni
were sperm-like creatures with light bulb heads, representing
ideas. The tagline was: ``How Many of Yours Will Get In?'' That one
was tagged tacky, tasteless, sexist and silly.
</P>
<P>
   And the Public Relations Society of America created a roar in
1994, when its call for entries showed a swastika on its cover.
Type imposed over the symbol read: ``It Had A Strange Name. It Was
Ugly. It Was Created By Nazis.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon opening the brochure, there was a picture of a Volkswagen,
with the tagline: ``Never underestimate the driving force of public
relations.'' That one was deemed to make light of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   And while trying to capture the attention of an audience made up
of advertising executives is difficult, others have shown it can be
done without controversy.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, last year's call for entries, which was a mock-up
of an ad, won several awards, including a national Addy, an awards
program that had 60,000 entries.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Sullivan Higdon &AMP; Sink trio have plenty of
defenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to lighten up,'' said John Q. Harrington, vice
president and creative director at NKH&AMP;W. ``This isn't Sunday
school stuff _ this is advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   And besides, said free-lance creative director John Benson,
everyone always thinks they can do a better job than the guy on the
hot seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the old joke in advertising,'' Benson said. ``How many
people does it take to create an ad? One-hundred-and-one _ one to
create the ad and 100 who said they could have done it better.''

SPEEDWAY EXPECTED TO BRING TRAFFIC IN THE SKY AND ON THE GROUND

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Kan. _ Although the Kansas Speedway in Wyandotte
County won't open until 2001, there's already talk of traffic jams
on race weekends.
</P>
<P>
   But no one is complaining about the prospect of heavy traffic,
even though it could start as early as the Thursday before an
event. Nor is there griping about the mess as people head out of
town when the race is over.
</P>
<P>
   This has nothing to do with fans driving to and from the track,
which will be located near the intersection of Interstates 70 and
435 in western Wyandotte County. Instead, it will be the personal
jets and small airplanes that shuttle racing crews, drivers, owners
and sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you what, I bet (the Kansas City area airports) have no
idea what they are in for,'' said Berry Gamblin, program manager
for flight tracking software at Dimension International Inc. of
Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Gamblin's company captured the spectacle last year before a
Winston Cup race in Loudon, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   A few days before the race, the software picked up the radar
blips of more than 100 planes as they took off from North Carolina,
where most of the racing crew members live, and headed to Loudon.
</P>
<P>
   After the race, there was a mass departure, with race crews
headed back to North Carolina and sponsors back to their
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``You better tell your airports that they better have plenty of
fuel,'' said James Wyatt, owner of Wyatt Aviation Service in
Homestead, Fla. ``The race weekends are also a gold mine for rental
car people.''
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt runs a company based at Homestead General and Homestead
Regional airports that provides car rental, catering and fueling
services for airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Last month was busy when the Pennzoil 400 was held at the
Homestead-Miami Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt said he handled about 310 airplanes, rented about 400 cars
and sold about 53,000 gallons of jet fuel in four days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really fills the town up,'' Wyatt said. ``Unfortunately, we
have only three of those races a year. I wish we could have one a
month. Still, it is unbelievable when we do have them.''
</P>
<P>
   After the race is the most hectic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The race really does not end until they reach home,'' Wyatt
said. ``The race includes trying to be the first on the taxiway to
the runway, then out to the runway and all the way back to North
Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   And the thought of all that air traffic has area airport
managers dreaming of the bonanza that might come.
</P>
<P>
   Some cities even are trying to expand their airports in hopes of
capturing a piece of the traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Boerger, director of operations for Kansas Speedway, said
it is difficult to predict how much air traffic there will be. No
formal agreements have been reached yet with auto-racing
sanctioning bodies to hold races at the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not guaranteed a Winston Cup event, which is the
granddaddy of them all,'' Boerger said.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the track is trying to attract such an event, along
with a Busch Grand National race, an Indy car race and a truck
race. Schedules for the 2001 racing season will not be determined
until next year.
</P>
<P>
   Boerger said the Kansas Speedway is hoping races will take place
as often as four times a year. If that happens, Boerger said, the
track would bring in up to 1,000 planes annually.
</P>
<P>
   That amount of traffic, he said, would be similar to what
International Speedway Corp., the parent company of Kansas
Speedway, sees at its 11 other racetracks, including the Talladega
Superspeedway in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we hold a Winston Cup event at Talladega, that becomes
the busiest (regional) airport in the country,'' Boerger said.
``Air traffic increases tremendously.''
</P>
<P>
   Area airport managers say they think they'll be ready to handle
the virtual air force that follows racing events. It's just a
question of where the planes choose to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to see quite a bit of traffic,'' said Lee Metcalfe,
executive director for the Johnson County (Kan.) Airport
Commission, which oversees two airports.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will come down to a matter of convenience,'' Metcalfe said.
``The racetrack will have to be nearby, and there will have to be
an availability of lodging and parking space for the planes.''
</P>
<P>
   Erica Hupp, a spokeswoman for the Kansas City Aviation
Department, said Kansas City's airports have plenty of capacity to
handle the planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need to expand any of our airports because the
capacity that we can handle is pretty high,'' Hupp said. ``We would
really welcome more flights.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Leavenworth and Lawrence are looking to expand their
airports in part so that they will be able to grab some of the
racetrack-related air traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leavenworth currently doesn't have the capacity to fuel up jet
aircraft,'' said Gary Ortiz, Leavenworth's city manager, which
leases space at Sherman Army Airfield for its airport.
</P>
<P>
   Leavenworth has exclusive rights to about eight acres of the
airfield, but wants to expand its rights to 234 acres or have the
Army cede the property to the city.
</P>
<P>
   With either of those options, Ortiz thinks the city would able
to attract some of the aircraft because the airport is about as
close to the racetrack as Lawrence is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have heard that proximity is the major determinant as to
where they will fly into,'' Ortiz said. ``They will pick the
closest place. That puts us right in the running for that if we
have expanded use of the facility.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lawrence is seeking $5 million in state and federal
aid for several projects at the Lawrence Municipal Airport,
including increasing the length of its runway to handle business
jets.
</P>
<P>
   While the potential to attract racetrack-related air traffic is
one reason behind the expansion, the city said the main driving
forces are economic development and the growth of general aviation.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Bryant, chairman of Lawrence's Aviation Advisory Board,
said the expansion is needed to retain businesses at the
70-year-old airport as well as attract new businesses to the
airport and Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we expand our runway, we will be able to accommodate
about 75 percent of all the business jets,'' Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lawrence is thirsting to attract some of the air traffic
that might come because of the racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody really knows how large a fleet will be flying in for
the events,'' Bryant said. ``But we want to make sure that we get
our slice of the pie. We want our share.''

`TOY,' `MILE' GIVE HANKS TOP 2 SPOTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tom Hanks ruled at the nation's multiplexes as ``Toy Story 2''
and ``The Green Mile'' dominated a moderate weekend, with the
animated sequel edging the prison drama with an estimated
$18.7 &UR;  &LR; million at 3,238 theaters during the Friday-Sunday period,
studio sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toy Story 2,'' which fell only 32 &UR;  &LR; percent from the previous
weekend, has taken in an impressive $140.8 &UR;  &LR; million overall as it
topped the box office for three consecutive weekends. With Hanks
reprising his role as the voice of Woody, the sequel looks likely
to become the 29th member of the $200 &UR;  &LR; million club by the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Disney distribution chief Chuck Viane said ``Toy Story 2'' is
continuing to draw well among all demographics. ``We are seeing
strong numbers for the 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. shows, which means it's
playing very well to adults,'' he added. ``We think some of its
best days are ahead of it around Christmas week.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros.' opening of ``The Green Mile,'' with Hanks
portraying a prison guard on Death Row during the 1930s, finished a
close second with $18.6 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,875 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers said the returns were respectable, given its
three-hour running time and ultraserious subject matter.
</P>
<P>
   With a difference of under 1 &UR;  &LR; percent between the top two films,
it remains quite possible for ``The Green Mile'' to emerge as the
weekend winner today when final numbers for the Friday-Sunday
period are released.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no surprise that `Toy Story 2' continues to perform well,
but the numbers for `The Green Mile' are a tribute to the pulling
power of Tom Hanks,'' said longtime tracker Arthur Rockwell.
``Serious pictures don't always have a wide audience so I'd also
say this has been well-marketed by Warner Bros.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner distribution chief Dan Fellman said moviegoers polled
after seeing ``The Green Mile'' had given it outstanding scores
with 97 &UR;  &LR; percent saying they would recommend it. ``These are the
best exit polls we've ever had,'' he declared. ``It really is the
people's choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source tracking service,
said ``The Green Mile'' should perform well through the holiday
season, particularly given its status as a leading Academy Awards
candidate and the strong word-of-mouth among moviegoers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're about 10 days away from the period of heavy
moviegoing,'' he added, noting ``The Green Mile'' could take in as
much as $145 &UR;  &LR; million by the end of its run.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Green Mile,'' based on a Stephen King story, is directed
by Frank Darabont, who also adapted King's ``The Shawshank
Redemption'' in 1994. Despite strong critical backing,
``Shawshank'' grossed only $28 &UR;  &LR; million overall.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's opening of goofy comedy ``Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo,''
starring Rob Schneider as a fish-tank cleaner turned male escort,
generated solid results in third place with $13 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,151
theaters. ``We think `Deuce' might play very well through the
holidays because there's not a lot of competition for the teen-age
audience,'' Viane noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deuce,'' produced by Adam Sandler's Happy Madison label, is
certain to be a moneymaker with a reported price tag of only
$15 &UR;  &LR; million.
</P>
<P>
   The top three films kept the box office healthy with
$50 &UR;  &LR; million of the $80 &UR;  &LR; million total, about matching last
weekend's total while topping the same weekend last year by
8 &UR;  &LR; percent. Total domestic gross for 1999 has already gone past the
$6.93 &UR;  &LR; billion total for 1998 and is on track to finish close to
$7.5 &UR;  &LR; billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers continue to be very impressive, particularly since
most people are still more concerned about holiday shopping,''
Rockwell said.
</P>
<P>
   MGM's fourth weekend of ``The World Is Not Enough'' led the rest
of the pack with $6.2 &UR;  &LR; million at 3,063 theaters as the 20th James
Bond movie dropped 40 &UR;  &LR; percent from last weekend. ``World'' needs
less than $500,000 to become the 199th movie to cross the
$100 &UR;  &LR; million mark in domestic grosses.
</P>
<P>
   Universal's third weekend of ``End of Days'' continued its fast
fade at multiplexes as it finished fifth with $4.7 &UR;  &LR; million at
2,652 sites, falling 51 &UR;  &LR; percent from its second weekend and barely
edging Paramount's fourth weekend of ``Sleepy Hollow'' with
$4.6 &UR;  &LR; million at 3,065 locations. ``Days'' has drawn $53 &UR;  &LR;  million
overall while ``Sleepy'' has topped $82 &UR;  &LR; million.
</P>
<P>
   Universal's sixth weekend of ``The Bone Collector'' finished a
distant seventh with $1.7 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,031 theaters, followed by
Lions Gate's fifth weekend of ``Dogma'' with $1.2 &UR;  &LR; million at 1,159
screens, Warner's fifth weekend of ``Pokemon: The First Movie''
with $1.1 &UR;  &LR; million at 2,426 sites and USA Films' seventh weekend of
``Being John Malkovich'' with $957,000 at 630 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's ``The Insider'' finished well out of top-10 contention
with just $573,000 at 823 theaters, pushing its gross to just
$24.9 &UR;  &LR; million after six weeks despite a strong Oscar buzz. The Los
Angeles Films Critics Association named it the year's top movie on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Two other dramas targeted for Oscar consideration posted solid
numbers in limited release, with Miramax's ``The Cider House
Rules'' taking in $115,000 at eight theaters while Disney's
``Cradle Will Rock'' drew $94,000 at eight sites.
</P>
<P>
   The holiday movie season will kick into high gear Friday as a
trio of high-profile films open _ Disney's comedy ``Bicentennial
Man'' with Robin Williams, 20th Century Fox's period drama ``Anna
and the King'' with Jody Foster and Sony's family comedy ``Stuart
Little'' with a computer-generated mouse voiced by Michael J. Fox.
``Bicentennial Man'' and ``Anna and the King'' both drew strong
business from sneak-preview screenings Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum said ``Bicentennial Man,'' ``The Green Mile'' and
``Toy Story 2'' will probably battle for first. &UR;

DINER OWNERS CLOSING THE DOOR ON 40-YEAR ROUTINE

 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The last thing Nick Nichols does when he
closes the diner is unwrap his apron, twirl it into a ball and
place it on a countertop. On his way out, he flicks off the lights.
</P>
<P>
   Betty, his wife, follows him out carrying a brown paper bag that
is growing grease spots. Leftovers. Today's lunch specials are
tonight's dinner for the couple.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Nichols twists the key in the front door lock till it
clicks. ``Stick a fork in me,'' he always says with a little smirk.
``I'm done.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Nicholses, it's a 40-year-old routine. But on Dec. 23,
they'll cook their last hamburger, fry their last chicken and serve
their last R.C. Cola (no Pepsi or Coke here). Nick and Betty's Cafe
is closing forever.
</P>
<P>
   When they began all those years ago, in the Leeds district in
eastern Kansas City, they just wanted to run a diner where
hard-working folks could eat a decent meal, pay a decent price and
feel welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Life's best dreams can be that simple.
</P>
<P>
   Before they close for good, their customers are telling the
Nicholses ``thanks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love coming in here,'' says ``Wild'' Bill Morrison, a
tow-truck driver and mule owner. For almost 40 years, he has sipped
coffee and argued politics with Betty Nichols. ``You're treated
just like family, orneriness and all.''
</P>
<P>
   In the center of it all is Nick Nichols _ husband, businessman,
short-order cook _ chatting with customers, an ever-present
cigarette dangling from his lips, smoke spiraling upward in blue
wisps.
</P>
<P>
   His gray hair has stood at attention in a quarter-inch burr
since his Army days in the 1940s. His face crinkles when he smiles.
And at the diner, he smiles a lot.
</P>
<P>
   That's life at Nick and Betty's Cafe between 4 a.m. and 2 p.m. _
where the music is country, the coffee is thick and the stories are
all exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   It's a place where everyone is treated like family, one customer
at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Nichols, 71, likes the way the world looks at 3:15 a.m.
Streets dark. No traffic. All those boarded-up windows and
abandoned buildings on Stadium Drive could just as well be asleep,
not blighted.
</P>
<P>
   As he eases his 1999 Lincoln Town Car into the same parking spot
he has used for years, Nichols remembers how the Leeds district
once was. Before the floods washed away the doctor's office, the
post office, the gas station. Before the General Motors plant
closed in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Nichols knows life stirs nearby. His very best early
customers, about 10 of them, will arrive soon. Truck drivers.
Milkmen. Salvage-yard operators. All working men with big
appetites, men in ball caps and blue shirts with their names
embroidered above their pockets.
</P>
<P>
   He knows they'll want his biscuits and gravy. A side of bacon _
or two. Some come to hear the gossip. But all want his coffee.
</P>
<P>
   He jangles his keys, twists the lock open. The booths are
silent, the air stale from old smoke and cooled grease.
</P>
<P>
   First, he tears open a shiny bag of Cain's coffee, slides it
inside the basket and pushes the button on the coffee maker. Water
rumbles deep inside the machine, then gurgles. Nichols disappears
into the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Pots clang. Refrigerator doors open and close. Soon there's the
sound of sausage sizzling and bacon frying.
</P>
<P>
   The cafe opens at 5 a.m., but James Thorp, the first customer of
the day, arrives around 4. Thorp has a special job. After Nichols
makes the gravy and the radio starts blaring country love songs,
Thorp gets the nod: time to turn over the cafe's ``Open'' signs.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols flips the main light switch.
</P>
<P>
   Fluorescent bulbs hum to life. Outside, the diner's windows
glow, piercing the gloom of the early morning like a lighthouse:
Nick and Betty's Cafe is now open for business.
</P>
<P>
   At least for a few more days.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1959 when Nick and Betty Nichols leased their first
restaurant, Nick and Betty's Highway Lunch and Bar, at 31st Street
and Van Brunt Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Nichols worked his shift at the General Motors plant, then
came to the restaurant to flip hamburgers and fry chicken. His wife
taught him how to cook.
</P>
<P>
   Word spread that their food was good.
</P>
<P>
   Mouthwatering meat loaf. Creamy gravies smooth as glass. And a
Friday special of fried chicken so first-rate that Roberts Dairy
milkmen still drive all the way from Topeka just to eat it.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Nichols dreamed of the day she and her husband could own
their own place and never rent again. She saved all the quarters
she earned in tips.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, she had $1,000 in quarters and told her husband she
was ready to move. About the same time, a ``For Sale'' sign went up
in a building at 6422 Stadium Drive, just a few blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew this was going to be the place,'' Betty Nichols says.
``We bought it lock, stock and barrel.''
</P>
<P>
   With the help of friends from the old place, they slowly pieced
the diner together. In December 1974, they opened Nick and Betty's
Cafe. The crowds came then, and still do.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Betty Nichols has poured swimming pools of coffee,
heard thousands of stories and fed customers from every social,
economic and ethnic group in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, when I first opened at the other restaurant, I had
some people tell me that I shouldn't serve blacks,'' she recalls,
anger flashing across her eyes. ``I sent those people out of my
place. I don't put up with that nonsense. Never had, never will.
Besides, everybody's money is green.''

   ... everybody's money is green.''
</P>
<P>
   At noon on a recent Friday, 18-wheelers line Stadium Drive like
a truck stop. Inside the cafe, milkmen share booths with bus
drivers. Mechanics sit next to crane operators. The voice of Paul
Harvey drones from the radio near the cash register.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all like a big family comin' here to eat,'' says Tim
Solomon. ``You go to McDonald's and you can't buy a filling lunch
for $3.50.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know only one other place that makes gravy like this: my
grandmother's,'' says Ron Stephenson.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a working man's place, not a chain,'' says John North.
``Here, you're a person.''
</P>
<P>
   Betty Nichols smiles at the compliments, then glances at the
cafe's glass front door. It's covered with bumper stickers. About
10 years ago, someone shot holes in the door with a BB gun.
Probably kids, she says. She pasted over the holes with the
stickers.
</P>
<P>
   Five of them say, ``Tough times don't last; tough people will.''
</P>
<P>
   And there have been tough times for the Nicholses.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Nick Nichols arrived and found the freezer and several
pounds of meat bobbing among the booths like bath toys. It was a
500-year flood, and it swallowed the cafe and all the other
businesses on Stadium Drive.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols told his wife they were through. But they weren't.
</P>
<P>
   It took weeks of scrubbing, bleach and sweat to remove the
ugliness, stink and germs from the 4-foot-deep muck. It also took
all six of their children to undo the mess.
</P>
<P>
   But then, the cafe has always been a family affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``The regulars have all watched us kids grow up,'' Larry
Nichols, 41, says on a recent Friday as he sips his fifth cup of
coffee. ``Two of my sisters met their husbands here, and all my
girlfriends worked as waitresses. I think they were hired just so
my mom could check them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been on Mom and Dad to close for years,'' he says.
``It's sad for us, too. We'll definitely grieve the loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the work here is too hard, too long of hours. And, man,
those country-fried steaks.I've seen country-fried steaks cold,
frozen, hard, burnt, shriveled up and fresh off the grill. I hope
to never see another country-fried steak again.''
</P>
<P>
   Then ``Wild'' Bill Morrison walks in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here comes trouble,'' Betty Nichols says, loud enough for
Morrison to hear, as he slides into a booth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, oh boy. Mercy sakes ali-i-i-i-ve,'' Morrison says with a
nasal-toned twang that could peel paint off a metal door. ``Don't
tell Betty if you like our current president. She once throwed a
dish rag at my head when I did. Me and that ol' boy have three
things in common: We're both named Bill, we're both from Arkansas
and we both lo-o-o-o-ove pretty women. Yessiree.''
</P>
<P>
   He flashes a grin at Betty Nichols, who threatens him with a
mock slap.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some good fights haven't we Wild Bill?'' she says
and gives him a wink.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost a year ago when Betty Nichols' eyes couldn't tell
the difference between a one-dollar bill and a hundred. Her hearing
isn't so good anymore, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctors don't know exactly what's wrong,'' Betty, 74, says
with a sigh. ``I guess it's just age. After raising six kids, I'm
finally gonna be able to be a housewife. I'll be able to do my
laundry leisure-like.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last few months, she's cut her workload. One day not long
ago, she looked at a regular customer and didn't recognize him. The
customer asked why she was ignoring him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, that shook me up when he asked me that,'' she says. ``I
never want anyone to feel hurt. I just can't see anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   On this day, Betty sees well enough to walk the aisles, but she
greets regulars and new faces alike, saying the same thing: ``Is
everything OK? Do you want more coffee? You doin' all right this
morning?''
</P>
<P>
   Then she sits at a booth, lights up a cigarette and blows the
smoke toward the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was ready to close three months ago,'' she says. ``It was
Nick that kept putting it off.He really likes being here. It'll be
hard to imagine neither one of us being here at all.''
</P>
<P>
   But through Dec. 23, customers still can find Nick Nichols
behind the orders window, maestro of the short order.
</P>
<P>
   Pancakes? Eggs? Side of bacon but with just a dollop of gravy?
</P>
<P>
   No problem.
</P>
<P>
   His hands dance over the blue flames of the gas stove. With his
left hand, he stirs the pancake batter. His right grabs a brush,
then cues an omelet pan with butter.
</P>
<P>
   He cracks two eggs with a one-hand smack, then tosses them into
the skillet, sans shells. With perfect timing, he reaches for the
bread with his free left hand, places four slices between his
fingers like rings and slides them into the toaster in one overhand
motion.
</P>
<P>
   A cigarette dangles from his lips, ashes hanging. He scoops the
eggs, pancakes, the toast as it pops up, and dabs the plate with a
little gravy before finishing his masterpiece with a single slide
of the knife cutting the toast point to point.
</P>
<P>
   The cigarette ash never falls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you what I'm gonna miss most,'' he says. ``It's
B.S.-ing with all the guys.I'll miss that. Yes, I will.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nicholses plan to enjoy their retirement. First will be a
trip to Cancun, Mexico. And they plan a lot more traveling, too.
</P>
<P>
   New owners are reopening the diner in January. Nick Nichols
might even help with the cooking just to show them how.
</P>
<P>
   But it won't be Nick and Betty's Cafe anymore.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the plates clank and the ice cubes jingle and glasses
fizz over with R.C. Cola.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Nick will nod one last time and turn the signs to
``Closed.'' He'll unwrap his apron, twirl it into a ball, and flick
the light switch off.
</P>
<P>
   The front door will lock with a click. A click echoing the end
of an era _ Nick and Betty's Cafe, closed forever.

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
ANAHEIM, Calif. _ After a couple of days of feeling out other teams
and gauging interest in their players unsigned beyond 2000, the
Astros may have found a trading partner.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sources said Sunday the Astros and Boston Red Sox are discussing
a deal that would send center fielder Carl Everett to the American
League in exchange for top shortstop prospect Adam Everett and at
least one more player _ one of whom likely would be a pitching
prospect.
</P>
<P>
   According to sources, the next move belongs to the Red Sox, who
might have to make some roster adjustments to afford the Astros'
arbitration-eligible center fielder, who could make as much as $5
million next season. It's also possible the Red Sox could be
looking into the feasibility of signing Carl Everett to a long-term
contract before pulling the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   A deal does not appear imminent at this point. Astros general
manager Gerry Hunsicker, as per his policy on trade speculation
involving specific players, declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Everett, who made $2.4 million in 1999, has been with the
Astros since December 1997, when he was acquired from the New York
Mets in exchange for righthanded reliever John Hudek.
</P>
<P>
   Everett has a .310 batting average with 40 home runs, 184 RBIs
and 41 stolen bases in two seasons with the Astros, including a
breakout season in 1999 when he hit .325 with 25 homers and 108
RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros don't have a burning desire to trade the 27-year-old
switch hitter, but they do need to relieve the logjam in their
outfield, and they also run the risk of losing Everett without
compensation on the free-agent market next winter.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker has said any player not under contract beyond 2000 is
a candidate to be traded in the absence of working out a contract
extension. Lefthanded pitcher Mike Hampton and right fielder Derek
Bell also fall into that category. Hunsicker has said negotiations
on contract extensions for Everett and Hampton are ongoing.
</P>
<P>
   The GM also has made it clear that acquiring a shortstop is a
top priority. Whether Adam Everett, 22, is ready for the major
leagues remains to be seen, but many baseball observers love his
upside potential.
</P>
<P>
   The righthanded-hitting shortstop, best known for dazzling
defense, hit .263 with 10 home runs, 44 RBIs and 21 stolen bases
last season for the Red Sox's Class AA affiliate in Trenton.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the caution with which Hunsicker has advanced young
players to the majors, Adam Everett likely would spend some time at
Class AAA New Orleans if the trade were completed.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-1, 167-pound shortstop has played in only 119 career
minor-league games. The Astros plan to open the season with Tim
Bogar as their every-day shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   Bogar started 75 games at shortstop in 1999 _ mostly while Ricky
Gutierrez was on the disabled list _ and hit .239 with four homers
and 31 RBIs. The Astros are willing to sacrifice offense with Bogar
because his glove is so reliable.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros could have as much as $17 million committed to their
starting outfielders if Carl Everett is not traded, considering
Hunsicker has had no luck moving Moises Alou or Bell. Alou has a
no-trade clause, and there hasn't been much of a market for Bell,
who is coming off his worst season and will make more than $6
million in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The aforementioned outfield alignment also would keep talented
youngsters Richard Hidalgo and Daryle Ward on the bench. Any
outfield alignment the Astros employ in 2000 will not include Ken
Griffey Jr., whose agent, Brian Goldberg, on Sunday said Griffey
doesn't intend to play anywhere other than Seattle or Cincinnati.
The Reds backed out of trade discussion for Griffey on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he (Griffey) can't go to Cincinnati, he's going back to
Seattle for the final year of his contract,'' Goldberg said. ``He's
not a rent-a-player.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros had discussions with the Mariners on Sunday but
concluded there was no match. Several teams are coming to that
conclusion at these meetings, which have not been as active as some
might have expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised (by the relative inactivity), because you
just never know,'' Hunsicker said. ``A lot of people come here with
great expectations, but in reality there are only about a
half-dozen trades every year. Some years there are more; some years
there are less.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think money is holding up a lot of teams from doing
anything. Odds are, we won't do anything here, but I wouldn't rule
it out.''
