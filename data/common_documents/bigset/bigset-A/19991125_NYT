LEETCH BREAKS ARM AS RANGERS TOP LIGHTNING

<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Even when they win, the New York Rangers lose.
</P>
<P>
   Playing desperate hockey from the start, the Rangers turned in
their most complete performance in more than a month to end the
Tampa Bay Lightning's home-ice winning streak at five games with a
6-3 victory at the Ice Palace here Wednesday night. But the victory
came at a tremendous cost as the Rangers captain, Brian Leetch,
broke his right arm blocking a shot by Fredrik Modin seven minutes
into the game.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate word on how long Leetch would be out. But
if he is out for a couple of months, the Rangers _ who won for only
the third time in their last 14 games _ are in for even more
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Rangers were without Leetch, their best
offensive defenseman, for a significant chunk of the season was in
1992-93, when Leetch missed 48 games due to injury. Leetch sat out
34 straight games from Dec. 17 to March 9 that season with a
compressed nerve in his neck, and then the final 13 games of the
season after he fractured his right ankle on March 19. The Rangers
finished last in their division that season.
</P>
<P>
   The injury to Leetch, 31, _ who signed a four-year contract
extension this summer worth $34 million _ was not the only one
suffered by the Rangers defensive corps tonight. The Rangers also
lost defenseman Stephane Quintal to a possible concussion midway
through the first period. They had to play the final 2 1-2 periods
with only four healthy defensemen, including one, Kevin Hatcher,
who had been a healthy scratch four of the team's previous six
games due to his poor play.
</P>
<P>
   And that wasn't all so far as injuries went. Center Tim Taylor,
who has been the Rangers' best forward all season despite an
appendectomy, a concussion, a foot injury and surgery to remove a
splinter from his hand, left Wednesday night with bruised ribs
after blocking a shot by Pavel Kubina with his body 4 minutes 48
seconds into the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the Rangers prevailed against a much-improved Lightning
squad, thanks to goals from Kevin Stevens, Mike Knuble, Mathieu
Schneider, Michael York, Petr Nedved and Alexandre Daigle.
</P>
<P>
   Daigle, who was appearing for the first time against the Tampa
Bay team that let him go for free to the Rangers, also had a an
assist.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of Leetch could not have been a more devastating injury
for the Rangers' embattled coach John Muckler and their equally
embattled president and general manager, Neil Smith, who have
presided over a 6-12-3-1 start.
</P>
<P>
   The Lightning was attempting to set a club record with its sixth
straight victory on home ice. The Rangers were looking for their
first victory in nearly two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   So both teams had something to play for this evening; and they
both came out flying from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Within the game's first 45 seconds, each team had hit a post, as
shots from Tampa's Darcy Tucker and the Rangers' Theo Fleury
clanged off the iron within 10 seconds of one another.

Texas' Applewhite, Texas A&AMP;M's McCown share similar skills,
intangibles
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JEROME SOLOMON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
MAJOR Applewhite and Randy McCown have a lot in common.
</P>
<P>
   They are quarterbacks at the state's two largest universities
and have put up numbers this season others would envy.
</P>
<P>
   And as is the proverbial norm for quarterbacks everywhere, they
probably get too much credit when things go well and definitely
shoulder too much blame when things go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe the most shared characteristic of the two is a will to
do whatever it takes to get better.
</P>
<P>
   Now, here comes the one obligatory line that is present in every
story on Applewhite and McCown.
</P>
<P>
   (Just as Applewhite deadpanned earlier this season, ``There
can't be an article about me without at least one crack,'' the same
holds true for McCown.)
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at them. Neither looks like he is the type of guy to
lead Texas or Texas A&AMP;M onto a football field, but they will do so
for the second time against each other Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Applewhite's Longhorns prevailed in a 26-24 thriller.
This will be McCown's last chance to even the score.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' Mack Brown and Texas A&AMP;M's R.C. Slocum have talked about
the importance of their running backs _ Hodges Mitchell, Ja'Mar
Toombs, Ricky Brown, Tiki Hardeman, et al.
</P>
<P>
   And the teams' coaches have gone on at length about the boys up
front _ Casey Hampton, Semisi Heimuli, Shaun Rogers, Chris
Valletta, et al.
</P>
<P>
   Their contributions will indeed be valuable, but Applewhite and
McCown will make the difference. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite, the Texas sophomore quarterback, has already topped
the school's single-season marks for pass attempts (414) and
completions (251), passing yardage (3,132) and touchdown passes
(21).
</P>
<P>
   ``He continues to play as well as any quarterback in the
country,'' Brown said of Applewhite. ``He's poised, confident and
rarely makes a mistake. With him out there, you always know you
have a chance. He makes everybody else's job easier. I know he
makes it easier on a coach.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't make it easy on a defense, and he won't make it easy
on the Aggies this week.
</P>
<P>
   Last year against A&AMP;M, Applewhite completed 24 of 35 passes for
232 yards, and led the Longhorns on a scintillating 70-yard,
11-play drive in the final two minutes to set up Kris Stockton's
game-winning field goal with five seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great quarterback,'' A&AMP;M linebacker Jason Glenn said.
``He's just a redshirt sophomore, but he plays like he's a senior.
I believe he's going to be a Heisman candidate next year.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean Applewhite cannot be stopped. At least the
Aggies hope not.
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M hopes to take a page out of the Kansas State book in
getting after the Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   K-State disguised its blitzes, sending people from different
spots than it normally does. Even when Texas had the blitzes picked
up, K-State beat blockers one-on-one to get pressure on Applewhite,
resulting in three fumbles and three interceptions in his worst day
as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't let a quarterback like him sit back there and have
all day to pass; he'll pick you apart,'' Glenn said. ``You've got
to put pressure on him, let him know he's going to get hit over and
over. Hopefully, he'll get nervous and start making some
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Frazzled nerves are far from the norm for Applewhite, who Texas
receiver Kwame Cavil refers to as the ``Ice Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Cavil should know. He has been on the receiving end of 85
Applewhite tosses this season, establishing a Texas and Big 12
Conference record. Cavil, who will be the third Longhorn and first
since Bob Bryant in 1956 to lead a conference in receptions, needs
just 72 receiving yards to set a school mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing you know is Major will get the ball to you,'' Cavil
said. ``You can count on that. He gives you the chance to make
plays. He makes the right reads and the right throws. We just have
that connection.''
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite has found a connection with Ryan Nunez as well.
Nunez, who with 53 receptions is second in the conference in
catches, has been a solid compliment to Cavil, as has Montrell
Flowers, who leads the Longhorns in yards per catch (17.1) and is
tied with Cavil for receiving touchdowns with six.
</P>
<P>
   But the key to their success is Applewhite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he is a real good player, he makes really good
decisions,'' Slocum said of Applewhite. ``He is very poised, he
does a good job of protecting the football, he's a very accurate
passer, and he is the key to their offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Though everyone heaps praise on his football intelligence,
Applewhite said he cannot afford to rest on his laurels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great compliment, but you realize you don't rest on
that, obviously,'' said Applewhite, one of 10 semifinalists for the
Davey O'Brien Award, which is given yearly to the nation's top
quarterback. ``You understand why they say that. (It's) because you
have coaches preparing you, you have a will to prepare yourself and
you have a will to try to lead and help others.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McCown, A&AMP;M's senior signal-caller, hasn't gotten the acclaim
that Applewhite has, but he is just 246 yards from Kevin Murray's
A&AMP;M mark for passing yards in a single season (2,463 yards in
1986).
</P>
<P>
   McCown got his first start as a sophomore against Texas Tech in
1997, but more than half his 18 career starts have come this
season. Applewhite is only a sophomore, but he has started 20 games
for the seventh-ranked Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy has been a solid guy,'' Slocum said. ``He worked to
become a starter and was very supportive as a backup player. When
we have called on him to play, he has done a good job for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy has had a good career, we won a Big 12 Championship last
year (when he started seven games) and we're going to a bowl game
this year. I think he has been a good representative of the program
on and off the field.''
</P>
<P>
   McCown's season ended last year against the Longhorns when he
broke his collarbone diving for a fourth-quarter touchdown that was
part of a spectacular 17-point comeback, but he is not thinking
about that now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys did kind of cost me a lot of fun last year, but
that's water under the bridge,'' McCown said. ``This is my last
game at Kyle Field, so I'm not thinking about that kind of stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite criticism from some corners, he will be only the third
Aggie to finish a season with an average of more than 200 passing
yards a game. With just 48 passing yards against Texas, he will
move past Gary Kubiak and finish his career fifth on the all-time
Aggies passing chart.
</P>
<P>
   In 10 games this season, McCown has completed 144 of his 273
attempts for 2,218 yards and 13 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our expectations are so high and because of that, perhaps
people sometimes can look at things positively or negatively,''
Slocum said. ``You look at the numbers Randy has put up this year,
he certainly has done a credible job. You look at him, and he has
had one of the best passing seasons A&AMP;M has had.''
</P>
<P>
   Slocum said injuries at running back and the Aggies'
inefficiency at times on offense have overshadowed McCown's
contribution.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies had their first 100-yard rusher in their 10th game,
and much of freshman Joe Weber's total came in garbage time against
a soundly whipped Missouri team.
</P>
<P>
   Without a solid rushing attack (3.6 yards a carry), McCown's
numbers are even more impressive. Mitchell has eased the burden on
Applewhite with 1,227 yards (Toombs leads A&AMP;M with 457) and Texas
averages a half-a-yard more per carry than the Aggies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely difficult to (put up good passing numbers) when
your running game is not there,'' Applewhite said. ``They'll play
the corner(backs) off and then put everybody else in and start
blitzing you. It helps when you have a guy to take the load off
your back.''
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M had its season high in rushing (254 yards) in its last
outing, a 51-14 spanking of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally got the running game and passing game going in the
same game,'' McCown said. ``There's no telling where we'd be now if
we had jelled like that at the start of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things might have been a lot different. But you can't go back
and do anything about it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe McCown can't do anything about the previous 10 games, but
he is looking to do damage in this one. It will be a challenge
against the sixth-rated defense in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' defense has been stingy when it comes to rushing attacks
(11th in the nation at 92.5 yards a game), so the Aggies will
likely have to lean on McCown's arm to earn a win.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Longhorns will lean on Applewhite's.

Gailey might be walking tightrope
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DALE ROBERTSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   IRVING _ Jimmy Johnson has warned the Dolphins. He has put them
on notice, loudly and frequently. If their minds are still
wandering, it's out of his hands now. If they're determined to look
past the Dallas Cowboys to the big game, which is their next one
against Indianapolis, what can he do?
</P>
<P>
   Such is the upside-down state of the NFL in 1999. The mice have
become men. The cabbages are kings. The meek have inherited the
earth. The Cowboys are the undercard, the Colts the main event.
</P>
<P>
   Not so for Jimmy personally, of course. Oh, no. Hook him up to a
polygraph, then inquire as to whether he would rather whip Dallas
or Indianapolis, and we'd have a pretty good idea which answer
would make the machine go ``beep!''
</P>
<P>
   For Johnson, the Colts are merely an important division rival,
steeped in youthful talent. They are a steppingstone to the
playoffs and perhaps the home-field advantage once there. The
Cowboys? They represent a far more volatile, complicated mix of
emotions, running the gamut from love to hate.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has nothing but good tidings for the Dallas players he
knows, the guys he shaped and honed into twice Super Bowl
champions. He'll never have a bond with Dan Marino equal to the one
he forged with Troy Aikman. Together, Jimmy and Troy made a lot of
something out of 1-15 nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Flopping in the fourth
</P>
<P>
   Then, just like that, it all ended. Jerry Jones thought Jimmy
had become bigger than the Cowboys, a luxury only one man _ Jones _
would be permitted. Their egos clashed openly after the second of
the back-to-back titles, and Johnson wound up a talking head on TV,
biding time until the Miami job came open.
</P>
<P>
   Jones felt he was vindicated for chasing Jimmy off when his
stooge, Barry Switzer, copped another Vince Lombardi Trophy for him
two seasons later. But the Cowboys' travails of late have made
Jones look more like a chump than a champ. Somebody must be
accountable. For Dallas' current coach, Chan Gailey, Johnson is the
last guy he needs to have visit him at Texas Stadium for
Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Given the subplots and side issues, a Dolphins victory,
particularly if it's by a lopsided margin, may mark the formal
beginning of the end for Chan. If the Cowboys appreciate Gailey
anywhere near as much as they once did Jimmy, they will play their
hearts out for him. Jones will not suffer more foolishness gladly
today.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas is 5-5 despite having scored first in every game and
leading nine of the 10 at halftime. In their five defeats, the
Cowboys have lost the fourth quarter 50-9. Such facts aren't
reflective of a coach who makes sound strategic adjustments as the
game wears on or who inspires supreme effort when fatigue and
frustration have set in.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's Cowboys teams had the intangibles Gailey's team lacks.
But Johnson's Cowboys teams also had the tangibles. Aikman, Emmitt
Smith and Michael Irvin were gods and monsters back then, both
low-mileage and high-performance. Jimmy most definitely was in the
right place at the right time. He hasn't been quite the genius in
Miami as he was in Dallas, has he?
</P>
<P>
   Turning to Turner a possibility
</P>
<P>
   Gailey suffers by comparison nonetheless. He's an X's and O's
wonk, a rumpled, slightly lumpy fellow who casts no aura
whatsoever. Jones hired him because he was highly thought of as an
offensive tactician in Pittsburgh and because his presence would
pose no threat to that of the boss. Like Barry, he wouldn't cross
Jerry. Unlike Barry, he would be a credible authority figure, not a
cardboard cutout of a coach.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry gambled that Chan's coaching would put the Pokes back on
top after emperor Switzer's nakedness was finally noted, and he,
Jerry, could bask in the glory. The scheme might have worked, too,
if the Cowboys hadn't been so beaten down by injuries, starting
with the loss of wide receiver James McKnight, who blew out a knee
in a dumb exercise called the Blue-White game in training camp.
McKnight was brought in from Seattle to stretch defenses and take
the weight off Irvin. Now, Irvin is gone as well, perhaps
permanently because of a spinal condition.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, meanwhile, plays with a broken hand, and Aikman, who
returns after a forced two-game respite, tries to clear the cobwebs
from his bruised brain.
</P>
<P>
   However, all their problems notwithstanding, the Cowboys trail
only Washington in the NFC East, and they have beaten the Redskins
twice.
</P>
<P>
   More irony: It's the Redskins' coach, Norv Turner, whose shadow
dogs Gailey daily. Another guy Jones could keep on a short leash,
Turner is himself likely to be fired by the Skins. Jerry had much
affection for Norv when he was Johnson's offensive coordinator, so
speculation has begun that he'll replace Chan.
</P>
<P>
   Can you imagine a Redskins reject coaching the Dallas Cowboys? I
suppose if it's possible to imagine the Colts being of more
consequence than the Cowboys, you can.

In wake of tragedy, rivalry gains dignified air
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By NEIL HOHLFELD &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
The will to win remains strong for both sides. The dislike of the
color orange in College Station and maroon in Austin hasn't
changed. But something is missing from the Texas A&AMP;M-Texas rivalry
this season.
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be a lessening of the vitriol between the sides
in the wake of the Aggie Bonfire accident that claimed the lives of
12 people last week.
</P>
<P>
   Players, fans and administration of the University of Texas have
responded with sympathy and support to the A&AMP;M family. Even the
most intense fans of both teams have reached out and grieved
together in the wake of the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   According to Texas coach Mack Brown and Texas A&AMP;M coach R.C.
Slocum, the ratcheting down of the hate factor in the rivalry could
usher the series into the new millennium with a degree of dignity
that has been lacking recently.
</P>
<P>
   In conjunction with the annual game Friday morning, Brown and
Slocum appeared Wednesday at the Houston Touchdown Club luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been remarkable no matter how hard-core of a Texas fan
you are, you still have sympathy for what has happened,'' said
Slocum. ``Likewise, A&AMP;M people, regardless of their feelings about
Texas, realize it's really nice of them to be sympathetic toward
us. It's brought out some good feelings on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have had to go on the line in terms of what their
reaction is. The University of Texas has stepped forward boldly.
There's been no question about what their position is. Coach Brown
and their student body and their administration have been very
supportive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has served to say, `Hey, wait a minute. Don't even try to
trash this team or the players or the coaches or alumni.' This game
is about college kids going out on the field and competing fiercely
against each other and then walking off the field, the loser
congratulating the winner and saying see you next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, in his second season at Texas, said he has been
overwhelmed with the bonding between the bitter rivals in the wake
of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have gained more respect for Texans than ever before,''
Brown said. ``Everyone knows the passion they have for football and
for life, so you know the A&AMP;M-Texas rivalry will continue to be one
of the best rivalries in the history of college football.
</P>
<P>
   ``But maybe something positive will come out of the way that the
people throughout the state of Texas responded. Many of the people
handle the rivalry for what it is _ a great rivalry between two
great schools. But some have brought some anger into the rivalry.
Maybe this will let them understand that we should not and cannot
bring that anger to this rivalry.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the accident on Nov. 18, the chat rooms on both teams'
fan Internet Web sites were full of the usual back-and-forth
banter. Some of it was good-natured, but there were angry and, at
times, hateful messages. After the accident, Longhorns fans offered
sympathy and prayers via the Internet, and Aggies responded with
heartfelt thanks.
</P>
<P>
   There have been indications from Longhorns fans that they will
not chant ``Poooooor Aggies'' if Texas is ahead late in the game.
Aggies fans have asked that yell leaders stay away from the ``Beat
the hell outta TU'' chants. It's hard to say if those well-intended
feelings will carry over once the game starts.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, several Aggies players said they were
impressed with how the fans of the rival teams banded together in a
time of crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't surprise me because, I mean, they're people up
there just like we are,'' said A&AMP;M guard Chris Valletta. ``They
understand that honoring the victims and the families is much more
important than honoring a football game. That's the attitude
they've taken, and we appreciate that more than anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad in a sense that this has grown to be a hated rivalry.
That's not something that any fan should want to be a part of. A
hated rivalry is not a good rivalry. In the past years, there has
been an attitude of wanting to beat Texas just because `We hate
Texas.' But that's not the attitude this year. Of course, Texas is
our biggest rival, and we want to win this game more than any other
game. But the circumstances are different this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Slocum said he, too, had noticed an increased amount of hatred
in the rivalry in recent years. The reaction of Aggies and
Longhorns in the last week has eased some of that in-your-face
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some deep feelings between these two schools, but I
have always resented the minority on both sides of the fence who
try to make it into an annual hate contest,'' Slocum said. ``You
know, `We hate those guys. They're this and that.' That has no
place in college football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think hate is one of the worst emotions there is. Many of
the problems in our world are caused by hate. Without a doubt, hate
had been a part of this rivalry. Not to a great extent, but people
on both sides have tried to inflame things. We had an element; so
did they.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the rivalry, though, is in a friendly, wholesome way.
I think the tragedy we've had here has put that on the top shelf.
People understand we're in life together, we're in this state
together. We want to win, and they want to win, but beyond all
that, it's just a bunch of college kids out playing a football
game.''
</P>
<P>
   At least a few of those players usually can be counted on for a
few put-down remarks in the build-up to the game. Not this week,
however.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually we have a couple comments from them saying this and
that about us, and there's comments from us about them,'' said
Aggies linebacker Jason Glenn. ``This week, it's been like a
bonding thing, which is what we need after what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say, of course, that the players will act so
gentlemanly once the ball is kicked at Kyle Field Friday morning.
</P>

   ``They did the decent thing, and I respect them, and I'm
thankful for it,'' said Aggies center Seth McKinney, an Austin
native. ``But I'm telling you that once the game starts Friday,
that rivalry will be there. It's not like we're going to say,
`Well, we've got to treat these guys nice because of what they
did.' That rivalry's still going to there.''

TRIP WORTH IT FOR TWO TEAMS OF WILDCATS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the Arizona Wildcats, getting to New York was not
half the fun. But winning Wednesday night was pleasant enough and
it put them halfway to a championship in the Preseason National
Invitation Tournament
</P>
<P>
   In the opener of a doubleheader at Madison Square Garden, which
looked to be about two-thirds full, Arizona defeated Notre Dame,
76-60.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Wright scored 22 points and had 11 rebounds for Arizona
(3-0). Troy Murphy scored 22 points and had 10 rebounds for Notre
Dame, which fell to 3-1. The Wildcats will play in the title game
Friday night against Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   In the second game, Kentucky guaranteed an all-Wildcats
championship with a 61-58 victory over Maryland. Tayshaun Prince
led Kentucky with 21 points. Terence Morris scored 25 for Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona players and coaches shared much in common with other
travelers in and out of New York during this holiday week. Their
journey from the West was delayed twice, once by fog and then by
mechanical difficulties. Instead of arriving on Monday night, they
got here on Tuesday night and were unable to hold their scheduled
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a horrible experience, but we finally made it and we
are relaxed now,'' said Loren Woods, Arizona's 7-foot-1-inch junior
center, who had 13 points, 10 rebounds and seven blocked shots.
``If we would have practiced yesterday, we would be so dead. We
were so tired. It was in everybody's eyes. We were exhausted.''
</P>
<P>
   After arriving about 8:30 p.m. on Tuesday, the players ate
dinner, studied films and went to bed by 10:30. But Wednesday
night, they seemed fresher than the Irish, who practiced Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona sprang to a 4-0 lead and never trailed, although the
Fighting Irish drew as close as nine points with 7 minutes
remaining, but fell behind by 20 with 1:15 left as the substitutes
took the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They stayed in the game,'' Wright said of the Irish. ``They
didn't let us push them over.'' But he said coach Lute Olson had
told his players to take advantage of what seemed like Irish
fatigue. ``Coach just said `Let's keep pounding it to them' because
they looked tired in the first half,'' Wright said. ``That's how we
blew the game open.''
</P>
<P>
   Olson said of the fatigue factor: ``I think that we have a
little bit more depth than what they have. Murphy played 38
minutes. That's asking a lot when I think our big guys run the
court really well. It's not a case of where he can take his time in
getting back defensively because we're probably going to hurt them
if that's the case. I thought our big guys did a good job of
forcing him to play both ends of the court.
</P>
<P>
   Most impressive for Notre Dame was Murphy, a 6-9 sophomore
forward from Morristown, N.J., who showed a shooting touch from the
outside, but tended to play low on offense. Many of the Irish plays
were high passes to Murphy, who turned and bulled his way toward
the basket, often against two or three defenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough to play inside,'' Murphy said. ``They doubled
well. They had a lot of tough guys inside the post. I had trouble.
I brought the ball down. I got stripped. It gave them more
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Olson did not underestimate the value of keeping Notre Dame off
the free-throw line. The Irish were just 3 for 6 from the line,
compared to 13 of 19 for Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going into the game, that was the last thing I told the
guys,'' Olson said.
</P>
<P>
   David Graves scored 17 points for the Irish. Impressive for
Arizona were Gilbert Arenas, who had 15 points, and Richard
Jefferson, who had 13. As a unit, the Wildcats were quicker.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky and Arizona, two teams with the same nickname, have met
only four times, but one of the recent games was rather important.
In the 1997 NCAA championship game, Arizona defeated Kentucky,
84-79, in overtime. At the time, Kentucky was the defending
champion.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, they have met just once, in the Maui tournament two
autumns ago, and that game ended in an 89-74 Arizona victory. The
following spring, Kentucky defeated Utah for the national title.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday night's thrilling finale, Kentucky led Maryland by
16 points in the first half and by 13 points at the intermission.
But Maryland tied the score at 52-52 with a tip by Morris with less
than seven minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Stone gave Kentucky the lead back with a layup and the
margin gradually increased to five points. Maryland got back to
within one point with less than two minutes to play, and trailed by
only 59-56 with 32.6 seconds to play. But Juan Dixon's 3-point
attempt hit the rim and bounced out.  &QL;

BRYANT ISN'T READY
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Kobe Bryant missed his target return date
Wednesday night, and coach Phil Jackson now expects Bryant won't
play again for another two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Though he is presumably healing on schedule, Bryant was recently
ordered by doctors to stop shooting with his broken right hand. He
will undergo X-rays and a CT-scan again Tuesday, but Jackson _ who
hoped Bryant might play that same night _ now figures he'll be out
``at least'' another week after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look like it's going to be Dec.3 or 2nd or 1st,''
he said. ``They have to reassess what the process is. It's not
there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Bryant, ``That's news to me.''
</P>
<P>
   If he's out another two weeks, it will bring the total missed
time to eight weeks and perhaps 20 games. Bryant had hoped to be
back in six weeks, in time to play Utah on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. (Stephen) Lombardo told me not to really get down because
this was the healing process to begin with,'' Bryant said. ``I was
just hoping I'd come back a lot earlier. I wanted to come back
tonight. That's my expectation, that's what I was hoping for. The
doctor is another story. The bone is not ready to go. There's
nothing I can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he's participating only in noncontact drills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shooting still is a little bit iffy,'' Jackson said, ``but
most of the shooting he's participating in. He's kind of like a
student trainer or assistant coach, you know, who makes passes to
the big guys.... We're just not taking the risk of an accidental
thing where someone can (hit his hand).
</P>
<P>
   ``But I anticipate (next week) that they'll say, `OK, this is
looking a lot better, now you can do some things with protection.'
Then the decision has to be made how debilitating the protection is
going to be for his game.''
</P>
<P>
   And Bryant will continue to count the days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't concentrate on what I'm going through right now,'' he
said. ``I'll focus on what to do when I get back.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: The Lakers' other hobbled guard, Tyronn Lue, is
eligible to return from the injured list for Friday night's game
against New Jersey, but Jackson said he's not ready.
</P>
<P>
   Lue is recovering from a bone bruise in his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't practiced,'' Jackson said. ``He'll probably get a
practice in Friday at shootaround. And then we'll see what the next
week brings.''
</P>
<P>
   Streaking: A.C. Green played in his 1,041st consecutive game
Wednesday, tying the professional basketball record (for any pro
league) held by former Jazz player Ron Boone.
</P>
<P>
   Green, who two years ago broke the NBA's ironman record,
received a standing ovation when the mark was announced during the
second quarter Wednesday.

Gailey might be walking tightrope
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DALE ROBERTSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   IRVING _ Jimmy Johnson has warned the Dolphins. He has put them
on notice, loudly and frequently. If their minds are still
wandering, it's out of his hands now. If they're determined to look
past the Dallas Cowboys to the big game, which is their next one
against Indianapolis, what can he do?
</P>
<P>
   Such is the upside-down state of the NFL in 1999. The mice have
become men. The cabbages are kings. The meek have inherited the
earth. The Cowboys are the undercard, the Colts the main event.
</P>
<P>
   Not so for Jimmy personally, of course. Oh, no. Hook him up to a
polygraph, then inquire as to whether he would rather whip Dallas
or Indianapolis, and we'd have a pretty good idea which answer
would make the machine go ``beep!''
</P>
<P>
   For Johnson, the Colts are merely an important division rival,
steeped in youthful talent. They are a steppingstone to the
playoffs and perhaps the home-field advantage once there. The
Cowboys? They represent a far more volatile, complicated mix of
emotions, running the gamut from love to hate.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has nothing but good tidings for the Dallas players he
knows, the guys he shaped and honed into twice Super Bowl
champions. He'll never have a bond with Dan Marino equal to the one
he forged with Troy Aikman. Together, Jimmy and Troy made a lot of
something out of 1-15 nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Flopping in the fourth
</P>
<P>
   Then, just like that, it all ended. Jerry Jones thought Jimmy
had become bigger than the Cowboys, a luxury only one man _ Jones _
would be permitted. Their egos clashed openly after the second of
the back-to-back titles, and Johnson wound up a talking head on TV,
biding time until the Miami job came open.
</P>
<P>
   Jones felt he was vindicated for chasing Jimmy off when his
stooge, Barry Switzer, copped another Vince Lombardi Trophy for him
two seasons later. But the Cowboys' travails of late have made
Jones look more like a chump than a champ. Somebody must be
accountable. For Dallas' current coach, Chan Gailey, Johnson is the
last guy he needs to have visit him at Texas Stadium for
Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Given the subplots and side issues, a Dolphins victory,
particularly if it's by a lopsided margin, may mark the formal
beginning of the end for Chan. If the Cowboys appreciate Gailey
anywhere near as much as they once did Jimmy, they will play their
hearts out for him. Jones will not suffer more foolishness gladly
today.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas is 5-5 despite having scored first in every game and
leading nine of the 10 at halftime. In their five defeats, the
Cowboys have lost the fourth quarter 50-9. Such facts aren't
reflective of a coach who makes sound strategic adjustments as the
game wears on or who inspires supreme effort when fatigue and
frustration have set in.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's Cowboys teams had the intangibles Gailey's team lacks.
But Johnson's Cowboys teams also had the tangibles. Aikman, Emmitt
Smith and Michael Irvin were gods and monsters back then, both
low-mileage and high-performance. Jimmy most definitely was in the
right place at the right time. He hasn't been quite the genius in
Miami as he was in Dallas, has he?
</P>
<P>
   Turning to Turner a possibility
</P>
<P>
   Gailey suffers by comparison nonetheless. &Cx1f; z~?j~? w~? He's an X's
and O's wonk, a rumpled, slightly lumpy fellow who casts no aura
whatsoever. Jones hired him because he was highly thought of as an
offensive tactician in Pittsburgh and because his presence would
pose no threat to that of the boss. Like Barry, he wouldn't cross
Jerry. Unlike Barry, he would be a credible authority figure, not a
cardboard cutout of a coach.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry gambled that Chan's coaching would put the Pokes back on
top after emperor Switzer's nakedness was finally noted, and he,
Jerry, could bask in the glory. The scheme might have worked, too,
if the Cowboys hadn't been so beaten down by injuries, starting
with the loss of wide receiver James McKnight, who blew out a knee
in a dumb exercise called the Blue-White game in training camp.
McKnight was brought in from Seattle to stretch defenses and take
the weight off Irvin. Now, Irvin is gone as well, perhaps
permanently because of a spinal condition.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, meanwhile, plays with a broken hand, and Aikman, who
returns after a forced two-game respite, tries to clear the cobwebs
from his bruised brain.
</P>
<P>
   However, all their problems notwithstanding, the Cowboys trail
only Washington in the NFC East, and they have beaten the Redskins
twice.
</P>
<P>
   More irony: It's the Redskins' coach, Norv Turner, whose shadow
dogs Gailey daily. Another guy Jones could keep on a short leash,
Turner is himself likely to be fired by the Skins. Jerry had much
affection for Norv when he was Johnson's offensive coordinator, so
speculation has begun that he'll replace Chan.
</P>
<P>
   Can you imagine a Redskins reject coaching the Dallas Cowboys? I
suppose if it's possible to imagine the Colts being of more
consequence than the Cowboys, you can.

A DAY FOR THANKFUL EX-SOVIETS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When three former Soviet Republics recently agreed
to a U.S.-supported plan that will carry oil and gas from the
Caspian Sea to the West, Russian President Boris Yeltsin erupted
like a geyser.
</P>
<P>
   You could hardly blame him for his outburst. It wasn't that long
ago oil kept Communism afloat, with athletics serving as its
foghorn. The Soviet Union used Siberian oil money to keep its
people fed and its factories running and a sleek state-run sports
machine to blazon Communism's presence.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Iron Curtain was drawn to let democracy in in the late
1980s, the former Soviet Union has been stripped of minerals and of
men.
</P>
<P>
   Take Ukraine, which lost a liquid asset and a frozen asset to
the West and is poorer for it. Swimmer Lenny Krayzelburg and hockey
player Oleg Tverdovsky rode the wave of (begin ital)Perestroika(end
ital) to Southern California's shores and found simple abundance
sitting there for them like sand dollars on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   The high tide of prosperity has lapped them both, but neither
has been dragged down by success's undertow.
</P>
<P>
   Tverdovsky, 23, a gifted defenseman for the Mighty Ducks of
Anaheim, is three days younger than San Diego Chargers quarterback
Ryan Leaf but infinitely more mature. You won't hear him screaming
at his general manager, Pierre Gauthier, unless Gauthier is about
to step in front of a speeding semitrailer.
</P>
<P>
   Krayzelburg, 24, is four-and-a-half months younger than exiled
NFL running back Lawrence Phillips but inherently more responsible.
You won't see him blowing off a 6 a.m. workout unless he has a
temperature of 104.
</P>
<P>
   Everything Tverdovsky and Krayzelburg know about life, they
learned in the former Soviet Union: Cherish family. Value hard
work. Appreciate life's little luxuries.
</P>
<P>
   Why, the propaganda they spread is enough to make you glad for
glasnost.
</P>
<P>
   Krayzelburg emigrated to Studio City from Odessa with his
parents and younger sister in 1989, around the time Soviet citizens
were facing their first multicandidate elections. Freedom of
religion and the press would follow, but Oleg and Yelena
Krayzelburg were a few steps ahead of the crusade.
</P>
<P>
   They left their homeland so their children wouldn't be singled
out for being Jewish. Too, they were concerned Lenny, then 15,
might be drafted into the Russian Army to fight in the Soviet
Union's war against Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   He already had been enlisted to serve his country in another
arena. At the age of 9 he was deemed an Olympic prospect in
swimming and steered into a government-sponsored training program.
</P>
<P>
   If he had swum faster as an age-grouper, the Soviet government
probably would have balked at letting his family leave the country.
The Krayzelburgs got their exit visas, but their struggle was just
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Money was tight, so Krayzelburg worked to help make ends meet.
His swimming suffered in the juggling act. After graduating from
Fairfax High, he enrolled at Santa Monica College and swam well
enough there to earn a free ride to USC.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, two years after becoming a U.S. citizen, Krayzelburg
set his first American record, in the 200-meter backstroke. In
August, he broke the world records in the 100 and 200 backstrokes
to establish himself as America's brightest hope for an Olympic
gold medal in men's swimming in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Krayzelburg won't let his future obscure his past. In 1998 he
returned to Odessa for the first time since leaving nine years
earlier. He visited the pool where he had trained. The
once-beautiful facility was a bone-dry, cracked shell of its former
self.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was sad to see,'' said Krayzelburg, who has talked with
enough elite Russian swimmers to know times are tough all over the
former Soviet Union. Russia's top athletes used to lead relatively
privileged lives, but they now are having to support themselves and
their families while training _ just like U.S. athletes 20 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Krayzelburg, meantime, is getting by nicely on sponsorships and
U.S. Swimming stipends, an irony that isn't lost on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at my parents and how they've struggled and the truth
is, it would have been better for their lives to have stayed in
(Ukraine),'' he said. ``They've made huge sacrifices for their
children. That's why it's so special for me to be swimming well. If
my parents never are as financially well-off as they were before,
they know for sure their decision to move here was the right one.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 Ukraine declared its independence from the Soviet Union
and the world of a 15-year-old hockey player from the coal-rich
city of Donetsk suddenly expanded well beyond Moscow's city limits.
That's when the Mighty Ducks' Tverdovsky began to look at the NHL
as a destination and not just a dreamland.
</P>
<P>
   His life since then looks so charmed, you're tempted to
administer the white-glove test for magic pixie dust. Drafted
second overall by the Ducks in 1994, Tverdovsky was playing in the
NHL at the age of 18 for substantially more money than the $500 a
month he made skating with a team in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   It's true Tverdovsky has made an NHL All-Star team and will make
$1.7 million this year with the Ducks, who traded him to Phoenix
(nee Winnipeg) in 1996, only to re-acquire him in June. But his
success has not come without a price.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 Tverdovsky's mother Alexandra was kidnapped outside an
apartment building in Donetsk and held for $200,000 ransom by a man
who once coached her son.
</P>
<P>
   She was rescued after 11 days but not before Tverdovsky's sense
of security was shattered. Now, when he returns to Russia, he often
travels with bodyguards and ``my head's always on a swivel,'' he
said. ``I have to be very careful. Put it this way: I don't make
new friends. And I never go alone anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Tverdovsky's parents have been stuck in Moscow since January
because of visa problems. There they have stayed in an apartment
the size of Tverdovsky's garage in Anaheim Hills.
</P>
<P>
   The situation has taken its toll on him. He was frantic in
September when he saw a report on television that a bomb had ripped
through an apartment building near where his parents are staying.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no fun when you hear stuff like that,'' Tverdovsky said.
</P>
<P>
   With every news report from home, he appreciates his new life a
little more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just the money part,'' he said. ``If you want
something here, you just go get it. There aren't lines, there
aren't shortages. It's amazing the difference in the level of life.
People who live here don't know how lucky they have it.''
</P>
<P>
   On this day, it's worth pondering. &QL;

COWBOYS TEAMMATES SEE DIFFERENCE IN LETT
</HEADLINE>

By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ It was a typical Thursday at the Dallas Cowboys'
Valley Ranch training complex.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly five minutes before noon, Deion Sanders, cornerback,
kick returner and minister, made his usual come-hither speech over
the loud speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hear ye, hear ye, it's time for the Cowboys' Bible study,''
Sanders announced. ``If you get warmth from a bottle or a woman,
the only person who can give you true warmth is Jesus Christ. Come
one, come all. This is the final call.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 1998 season, humbled defensive tackle Leon Lett, then
a four-time violator of the NFL's substance-abuse policy and a year
past a 16-game suspension, heeded the call on a weekly basis.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks removed from his third substance-abuse suspension,
Lett was back at Bible study last Thursday. He is once again on the
recovery road and trying to right a career path that has been
sidetracked by so many on- and off-the-field transgressions,
including the drug violation that caused him to be suspended for
the first eight games of the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   No one is spouting of a spiritual rebirth in the vein of Sanders
or defensive tackle Alonzo Spellman. And no one is promising that
there will be no more relapses by the five-time drug-policy
offender who will take the field against the Dolphins at 3:15 p.m.
Thursday at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But the feeling around Valley Ranch these days is, as defensive
coordinator Dave Campo said, ``It's time for him to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's come back with a good attitude,'' Campo continued. ``I
hope he's got it together. After three or four times, it's time for
him to do it the right way.''
</P>
<P>
   Lett still doesn't talk much about the litany of off-field
issues. His thoughts on his return from the latest suspension
amounted to: ``I'm excited to play again. But I want to ease into
it and take a low-key approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammates, coaches and friends, however, say they notice a
difference in Lett's overall demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has more inner strength now,'' Sanders said. ``He was in
the Bible study last year, but it's one thing to be in it and it's
another to be ``in'' it. He's putting in his heart this time. I
just see him having more inner strength and inner peace. And he's
taking more control and being more responsible on and off the field
and in life.''
</P>
<P>
   While the substance-abuse issues have hogged all the latest
headlines regarding Lett, his melancholy nine years in the NFL are
dubiously notable for
</P>
<P>
   contrasting on-field images.
</P>
<P>
   On one side there's the rags-to-riches story of a 6-foot-6,
280-pound unblockable behemoth, who made the journey from being a
seventh-round long shot by way of Emporia State, Hinds (Miss.)
College and the Fairhope (Ala.) High School basketball team to
being one of the league's premier defensive linemen. Nicknamed the
``Big Cat'' because of his quickness, Lett was selected to the Pro
Bowl in 1994 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, there's the image of a bumbler, who will be
forever known for two goofball plays in the 1992 and 1993 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The first came in the waning moments of the Cowboys' 52-17
victory over the Buffalo Bills in the 1993 Super Bowl. Lett
recovered a fumble and sprinted toward the end zone. Once he got
inside the 10-yard line the excitement of the moment caught up to
him. The normally subdued Lett began to showboat, brandishing the
football in one hand. Bills receiver Don Beebe caught Lett from
behind and knocked the ball away.
</P>
<P>
   While the Cowboys were being hailed for their first Super Bowl
title of the 1990s, Lett was being assailed nationally for a
boneheaded play.
</P>
<P>
   The humiliation intensified a year later by another error in
judgment during a nationally televised Thanksgiving Day battle,
against the Dolphins, no less. After the Cowboys blocked a Miami
field-goal attempt, Lett touched the ball after it rolled
downfield. Miami recovered and turned it into the winning field
goal in a 16-14 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been in some sad situations,'' Campo said. ``It's like a
dark cloud has been over his head. I don't know why. Sometimes
things don't go exactly how you've planned.''
</P>
<P>
   Combine those two gaffes with the drug problems and you have an
unflattering picture that sent the already-shy Lett further into a
shell, causing a feeding frenzy for critics and pity from overly
protective friends.
</P>
<P>
   Campo, whose staunch defense of Lett in the past has been
criticized as condoning behavior, acknowledges that people close to
Lett may have been too protective of him at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was a little bit of that,'' Campo said. ``But it
was because I think Leon was a unique case. In my opinion, there
are people who are caught in some bad situations and there are bad
people. I am more apt to give leeway to a bad situation than a bad
person.''
</P>
<P>
   The two people who spent the most time with him during the
latest suspension say Lett is ready to do it himself.
</P>
<P>
   Former Mavericks star Mark Aguirre played basketball daily with
Lett at the North Dallas Athletic Club from August until October.
Other than finding out that Lett has a nice hoops game, he said,
``Leon is more focused on what he has to do and what he has to
maintain than any time I've known him.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys cornerback Kevin Smith, who joined the team in 1992 and
struck up a friendship with Lett, grew even closer to him this past
August. Smith had been sent home from training camp because of back
problems. With both feeling ostracized from the team, they hung out
for comfort and companionship.
</P>
<P>
   Smith agreed with Aguirre, saying Lett knows what he has to do.
More important, however, Smith said Lett is determined to change
his life and NFL legacy before it's too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``His whole mind-set is that he's a little disappointed in
himself, in what's happened,'' Smith said. ``He's appreciative for
the fact that he has another chance. He doesn't know how much
longer he will play. But he wants to finish his career up right and
go out on a good note. He has that chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said Lett is also mindful that this might be his last
chance if he fails again.
</P>
<P>
   ``He feels like his back is up against the wall,'' Smith said.
``He knows he can't screw up. That's pressure. But it's something
he has to deal with. For him not to know would be fooling himself.
The ball is in his court.'' nn

CELTICS POUNDED BY SPURS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's a suggestion for the Big Dig types to relieve traffic
congestion in the North End: Bring the San Antonio Spurs to town
more than once a year.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio brought its ``A'' game to the FleetCenter Wednesday
night and beat the Celtics like a drum, 121-98. The world
champions, the real Men in Black, started fast and never let up.
They shot 58 percent, had 35 assists, scored a season high in
points and, in the understated assessment of coach Gregg Popovich,
``probably played our best game of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   That comes as no news to the Celtics. They trailed by 13 after
one quarter, by 24 at the half, and by 31 after three. They had no
answer to Tim Duncan, who abused them mercilessly, with 31 points,
15 rebounds, 2 blocks, and one giant, painful reminder of the
quirky nature of bouncing lottery balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an awful night for us in so many different phases of
the game,'' Celtics coach Rick Pitino said, also an understatement.
``They physically dominated us. They kicked our ass in every
conceivable phase of the game. And we deserved an ass-kicking for
playing that kind of defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics went into the game with a long list of do's and
don'ts, all of which were moot by halftime. They also went into the
game being told that the Spurs shot 50 percent from international
waters in their nine wins and 29 percent in their three losses. The
Spurs were 8-of-16 Wednesday night but were 4-of-5 in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   It was a clinic at both ends. The Spurs had the answers inside
and outside. David Robinson shook off a shoulder scare at the end
of the first half and had 10 points and 9 rebounds in 25 minutes.
Mario Elie made 10 of 12 shots and had a season-high 25 points, 2
shy of his career high. Through three quarters, the Spurs were
shooting 63 percent to the Celtics' 35.
</P>
<P>
   And the Spurs moved the ball. Did they ever move the ball. When
Chucky Brown gets six assists, you know you're moving the ball. At
the half, they had more assists (19) than the Celtics had hoops
(17). Avery Johnson had nine assists in 26 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Boston was in it for a quarter, to be generous. History will
record it actually led, 2-0. It was the Celtics' only lead. The
Spurs broke it open in the second with a Terry Porter-led 7-0 run
(40-22) and a Robinson-led 6-0 burst (46-26).
</P>
<P>
   Then Duncan took over. He had 14 points and 8 rebounds at the
half and then submitted a 14-point (on 5-of-5 shooting), 6-rebound
third. The lead went into the 30s, and the fans flocked to the
exits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to execute,'' Duncan said, ``and everything went
as we had hoped.''
</P>
<P>
   Duh. As for the Celtics, well, their miserable night was best
summed up in two telling sequences, one which spoke to the overall
confusion generated by playing a team like San Antonio and the
other to yet another exasperating evening for Antoine Walker, who
was 5-of-21.
</P>
<P>
   The first came with San Antonio leading 40-22 in the second
quarter. The Celtics had come out of a timeout and worked the ball
around until it was in Kenny Anderson's hands at the top of the
circle. The 24-shot clock expired. Every Celtic looked as though he
had just been told their per diem was being withheld. No one from
the bench was yelling down the seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The other came in the third. Walker wasn't taking bad shots _
well, not too many. But he wasn't clicking. He'd drive and miss.
He'd pop out and miss. He took four treys and missed.
</P>
<P>
   With the Celtics trailing, 60-39, Walker went in for a layup and
missed. He got the rebound and missed another layup. The ball
squirted away, and the Celtics retained possession. Walker
subsequently got the ball in front of the Boston bench and fired a
trey. It missed. Later, near the end of the third, Pitino took him
out of the game after another missed trey prompted a chorus of
boos. Walker sat for the final 15:02, his 25-minute stint his
shortest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to keep shooting if I get those same looks,'' Walker
said. ``That's basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino also got into it a little with the crowd, but said
afterward, ``I just coach the team. I'm not concerned about the
other stuff. We're 7-5 right now, in the thick of it, and we have
to come out and play much better defense against Milwaukee
(Friday).''
</P>
<P>
   He's right about that. It would be hard for them to play worse
defense. But the Spurs are world champions for a reason. They
showed why Wednesday night.

AGGIES' LINEMAN TOUCHED BY TRAGEDY

<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Semisi Heimuli, who spent most of his
formative years in California, remembers the exact moment he
connected Texas A&AMP;M with its 12th Man football tradition.
</P>
<P>
   It came during his recruiting trip, when he noticed a sign in
Kyle Field proclaiming the place ``Home of the 12th Man.'' He
recognized the sign from casual exposure to college football
highlights through the years but never knew which school made the
claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `So, this is the place,' '' said Heimuli, a
graduate of Trinity High School in Euless, Texas. ``But I had no
idea what the 12th Man was.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the fifth-year senior, in the minds of many A&AMP;M fans, became
the embodiment of the school's 12th Man spirit when he became the
ringleader in organizing football players to help move fallen logs
after the collapse of the A&AMP;M bonfire tower that killed 12 students
on Nov. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Heimuli is scheduled to make his 50th consecutive start
for the Aggies, the most by any offensive lineman in school
history. When he lines up at right guard during his final home game
at 10 a.m. against Texas, Heimuli said he will draw on images he
witnessed at the bonfire site. He will reflect on emotions he felt
during the tragedy and lessons he has learned during a college
career that have made the 12th Man notion of Aggies supporting
Aggies very real to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's neat to me because I'm not used to that kind of stuff,''
said Heimuli, who moved from suburban San Francisco to Euless as a
teen-ager in 1993. ``In California, things are different. People
don't say `hello' on the street or wave to each other when they're
driving. In hard times, they go their own way and just worry about
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you walk around campus at A&AMP;M, and people say, `Howdy.'
It's the friendliest campus around. When I saw that, I didn't know
what an Aggie was. But I knew I wanted to be one.''
</P>
<P>
   Heimuli also knew his place when he began hearing reports of
dead and injured students at the bonfire site. While living in San
Bruno, Calif., he'd lost friends to gang-related shootings.
Although not a member of a gang himself, Heimuli said such
incidents were common in his neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing reports of peers dying at A&AMP;M spurred him to action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd dealt with death before. It always hurts to see young
people who never got the chance to live out their lives,'' Heimuli
said. ``Back in San Francisco, people were dying from doing bad
things. It was all gang stuff. But these guys were doing something
good when they died. That makes it worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Heimuli rushed to the bonfire site, encouraging a handful of
teammates to join him. Eventually, A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum canceled
practice and urged all players to assist in the rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Images of A&AMP;M players in their sweat-stained football
undershirts, caked with dirt from lifting logs, burn brightly in
the minds of fans and fellow students. Without question,
quarterback Randy McCown said, the experience bonded the team more
tightly and Heimuli deserves credit for leading the charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys went out there without truly understanding what
being an Aggie meant,'' McCown said. ``We came back with a
different perspective. You work your butt off with each other
lifting those logs, and you understand the camaraderie Aggies feel
for each other.''
</P>
<P>
   A soft-spoken type in most public settings, Heimuli said the
emotional nature of the bonfire tragedy struck a chord within him.
As one of the first on the scene, he arrived in time to see dead
bodies removed from the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time they brought another one out, I'd just pray, `Not
another one. Please, God, let them find someone alive down there,'
'' Heimuli said.
</P>
<P>
   Those memories, he said, will inspire him in his final
appearance at Kyle Field. Heimuli is on pace to tie Dat Nguyen's
school record of 51 consecutive starts at the Aggies' bowl game, a
record for iron-man endurance that left guard Chris Valletta
considers ``incredible'' for an offensive lineman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physically, the guy is unbreakable,'' Valletta said of the
6-foot-3, 309-pounder who is the first player of Tongan descent to
suit up for A&AMP;M. ``He's the kind of guy that, when he wants to do
something, you can't hold him back.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially if Heimuli wants to lend a helping hand to fellow
Aggies. A week after the bonfire tragedy, he still is uncomfortable
with praise he has received for simply helping out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole time we were out there, people kept coming up to us
and saying, `Thanks for being out here.' It's like they thought we
were special,'' Heimuli said. ``I don't think that. We're Aggies,
too. We may play football, but we're no different than anyone else
at this school. We should have been out there. There were people in
need and we responded.''

<P>
   While President Clinton lectured the Kosovars about tolerance
earlier this week, the ethnic cleansing that has been going on
under the noses of NATO continued. The Serb population is being
systematically reduced by hostile Albanians, and every day, smoke
rises from the burning of yet another Serb house. The Czech Jiri
Dienstbier, the UN representative on human rights, put it
succinctly: ``The spring ethnic cleansing of ethnic Albanians,
accompanied by murders, torture, looting, and burning of houses,
has been replaced by the autumn ethnic cleansing of Serbs, Romas,
Bosniaks, and other non-Albanians accompanied by the same
atrocities.'' Romas are Gypsies.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton asked the Albanian Kosovars whether they want revenge or
a better life. The answer is they want both. The Serb population of
Kosovo numbers between 60,000 and 70,000, down from more than
200,000 a couple of years ago. NATO is hopelessly unable to protect
the Serb population, and the UN efforts are underfunded,
understaffed, and demoralized.
</P>
<P>
   The shadowy Kosovar Liberation Army is lying low. Nobody who
knows anything about the Balkans believes these fighters will
simply fold their tents and accept the peaceful role that NATO has
prepared for them and that they have pretended to accept. They want
power and mean to have it.
</P>
<P>
   This century began with nationalistic wars in the Balkans,
taking advantage of the waning Ottoman power. Those wars have
resumed at century's end. The ethnic sorting out is not yet over,
and the humpty-dumpty dream of multiethnic harmony will not soon be
put back together again despite the idealistic American belief that
everyone can and should act just like Americans.
</P>
<P>
   With a typical predilection for euphemism, the State Department
now likes to talk about ``Southeast Europe'' to avoid the negative
connotations of ``the Balkans.'' But the dictionary definition of
balkanization still remains the breakup of societies into ever
smaller and hostile units.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, a new tyranny is waiting in the wings to replace the
old.

A BULLET RICOCHETS OFF A CELL PHONE AND AN OFFICER IS ONLY GRAZED 
</HEADLINE>
  (DELETES names of officers in grafs 2, 5 and 6 because they work
undercover) 
(DW) 
 By JAYSON BLAIR   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A plainclothes officer who was shot at during an
undercover drug operation in the Bronx late Tuesday night escaped
serious injury when a bullet ricocheted off his cellular telephone
and grazed his stomach, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, whose name was not released because he works under-
cover, was wounded when three men tried to rob him and another
officer during an undercover sale of cocaine that the police had
hoped would help build a case against a drug organization,
officials said. He was listed in stable condition at Jacobi Medical
Center Wednesday night, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Three men were arrested on attempted murder and attempted
robbery charges, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred at about 11:50 p.m. in an apartment in the
South Bronx. Police officials said that three suspected drug
dealers began firing in an apparent attempt to rob the two
officers.
</P>
<P>
   A bullet that probably would have struck the officer in the
stomach bounced off his cellular telephone and only grazed him,
Police Commissioner Howard Safir said outside the hospital
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The sergeant's partner, whose name also was not released, was
struck over the head with a pistol, but was able to fire eight
shots with his 9-millimeter handgun, striking one of the
assailants, officials said. The officer who had been shot fired two
rounds from his Glock handgun before backup officers arrived and
arrested the suspects, officials added. Investigators said it was
unclear Wednesday who shot the officer.
</P>
<P>
   The three Bronx men who were arrested were identified by the
police as Shane Palmer, 28; Raymond Thomas, 22; and Shawn Howell,
21, who was shot in the left leg.
</P>
<P>
   Howell was in stable condition at Lincoln Hospital, officials
added. Investigators said that a 9-millimeter handgun and a knife
were found at the scene.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE _ If October was a roller-coaster month, November has
been a straight and steady ride for the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, in the land of country music, cowboy boots, and
chewing tobacco, Boston improved its record in this month to 7-2-1
with a 5-2 victory over the Nashville Predators at the Gaylord
Entertainment Center. Five players scored goals for the Bruins and
goalie Byron Dafoe improved his record to 5-2-0.
</P>
<P>
   In their last seven games, the Bruins are 5-1-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Predators of the 1999-2000 season are a far cry from the
club's inaugural season when the Bruins outscored them, 13-3, in a
pair of games. Last year, Nashville finished 28-47-7, which is
actually much better than anyone would have predicted for an
expansion club.
</P>
<P>
   This season, the team is getting some steady play from its
veterans, while its young players are beginning to develop. The
club, which demolished the Montreal Canadiens, 6-1, on Nov. 18,
brought its 7-11-1 record into Wednesday night's game against a hot
Bruins' club.
</P>
<P>
   ``We responded well,'' said Bruins coach Pat Burns. ``We didn't
do anything fancy, but we put the puck at the net and got some good
shots. I thought that everybody had a good effort.''
</P>
<P>
   The opening period was pretty even, despite the Predators
jumping out to a 1-0 lead heading into the first intermission.
</P>
<P>
   That score came on a power play. With forward Steve Heinze off
for hooking down Predators right wing Scott Walker, center Cliff
Ronning skated the puck in from the right circle. He moved through
the slot and then flipped a high shot over Dafoe at 11:21.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins nearly tied it with two minutes left in the period.
Right wing Mikko Eloranta had been called for hooking, but the
Bruins got a shorthanded bid when Jason Allison tried to beat
goalie Mike Dunham with a forehander but the goalie gloved it.
</P>
<P>
   Boston cashed in during the second period, taking a 2-1 lead on
a pair of goals scored less than three minutes apart. With the
Bruins on the power play, captain Ray Bourque teed up a slapper
from the far right circle that rattled off the post and in to tie
the game at 1 at 4:24.
</P>
<P>
   Left wing Sergei Samsonov put Boston ahead briefly at the
seven-minute mark. Samsonov, whose minutes were reduced by Burns in
Monday's game against Carolina because of the physical nature of
play that doesn't favor Samsonov, scored his sixth goal of the year
when he beat Dunham with a forehander from the right circle that
beat Dunham to the near side.
</P>
<P>
   That lead lasted less than three minutes though.
</P>
<P>
   Center Randy Robitaille, who was dealt to Atlanta in June and
then shipped to Nashville two months later, camped out behind the
Bruins' net with the puck for several seconds and waited for help.
That came in the form of defenseman Craig Millar, who banged in a
shot from deep in the right circle past Dafoe at 9:57. The other
assist went to former University of New Hampshire standout Mark
Mowers.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins went back on top, 3-2, at 15:17 thanks to the steady
hands of left wing Dave Andreychuk, when he scored his 15th of the
season to equal last season's output. It took 23 games for him to
reach that plateau where last year, he had 15 goals in 52 games in
New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Andreychuk made it happen by stealing the puck from Ronning and
then fired a backhander from the slot that sailed past Dunham's
glove.
</P>
<P>
   Boston increased the lead to 4-2 at 17:25 when the checking line
chipped in. Left wing P.J. Axelsson gave the puck to Eloranta in
the left circle and he beat Dunham for his fourth goal of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, the Bruins continued to take the play to the
Predators.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville did have some opportunities, particularly on an
excellent power play midway through when David Legwand and
Robitaille tested Dafoe, but the netminder turned them back and
shut the door.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Hulbig closed out the offense with his first of the year at
14:34, scoring on his own rebound.

   Relax. It's still Thanksgiving weekend, still fall, still
November. The crunch doesn't have to start until next month.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the world may be acting as though a starter pistol just
went off, but a person can resist. A person can recall the immortal
words of Mom: ``If everybody jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge, would
you have to do it too?''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the season of joy often feels like a leap off a
bridge, from relative calm into chaos, and retailers try to push
consumers toward the edge earlier each year. The prodding begins in
the summer now, and by September, jolly holly elves are muscling in
on the Halloween outfits. Cardboard turkeys can hardly hold their
shelf space as in-between decorations anymore, which heightens the
frazzle factor for a person who can remember when the bird flew
solo for at least a month.
</P>
<P>
   Some people insist on mailing their Christmas cards before the
bird is cooked, which is really scary. Greetings received in the
middle of November should be returned to sender, stamped
``Undeliverable In Any Month Not Beginning with the Letter `D' or
'J.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Compulsiveness kills the spirit, which must be given special
care and feeding. The TLC should begin this weekend with real time
off _ a Saturday and a Sunday with nothing planned but sitting
around, much like that turkey carcass.
</P>
<P>
   A person does not have to get out there and shift those seasonal
gears. A person can wait until Wednesday at least _ the first day
of December _ or until next weekend, even, starting slowly in, say,
a small local shop with not too much merchandise on a quiet street
far from any parking garages. Figure on buying one present max, and
then plan on a nice quiet coffee break or a movie.
</P>
<P>
   The coming weeks will be easier, perhaps even fun, if the goal
isn't to get it all done but to pace oneself and extend the season
of giving to one's own mall-rattled psyche. What's your pleasure _
a walk, a swim, a massage, an afternoon with a book? Take the
relaxation pledge and make time for joy, starting now.
</P>

SWEET TALK CAN'T COVER UP THE FEUD BETWEEN JJs 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Listening to Jerry and Jimmy all week, it makes you wonder where
was this mutual-admiration society five years, seven months, and 25
days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to Jerry and Jimmy all week, it also makes you think
about investing in a polygraph machine.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they're being less than truthful with the nice stuff, to
such a degree one of our most treasured holidays has become
Thanksfibbing Day.
</P>
<P>
   What was heard from both parties seems to be a blatant attempt
to bring personal closure to the Great Macho War of 1994. That
parting of Jerry and Jimmy will live forever in national and local
sports lore. That parting has now brought happiness to both.
</P>
<P>
   But should closure be accepted? ``Never.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe not never. If Jerry will make a public admission
that he was wrong to allow a battle of egos to break up the
greatest NFL dynasty of all time, then, OK. Closure could happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Jones answered Wednesday, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Didn't think so, but it was a good try.
</P>
<P>
   Then, however, Jones continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being wrong and being responsible, those are different
words,'' he added. ``I do really believe my No. 1 role with the
Cowboys is to create incentives by putting a foundation in place
where players and coaches really want to be here, and be
invigorated and energized.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that, for whatever the reasons, I didn't do that in
this case, then I will shoulder the responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   But regrets? Jerry says there are none. So does Jimmy. The large
egos won't permit regrets. Those same egos caused the breakup. So
much success so soon was responsible for huge head-swelling that
led to chest pounding that led to the bye-byes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't disagree more,'' Jones said. ``First of all, none
of what was accomplished was totally about just us. That's unfair
to a lot of people around here who played a role in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you break it down to us, Jimmy came to the Cowboys with
a history of success. I came to the Cowboys with a history of
success. Neither of us got there by making decisions based on ego
or instant gratification. Certainly the egos were there, but so
were all the other factors.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting at the NFL bottom in 1989, within five years the
Cowboys of Jerry and Jimmy had run off consecutive Super Bowl
victories. The dynasty was built in a hurry. The dynasty appeared
to have the life-span of the Roman Empire. A thousand years, if not
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Professionally, there has never been anything for me so
satisfying,'' Jones said, ``or never anything more intense. And
when I say intense, this is coming from a guy who prior to the
Cowboys had once owed every bank in the country. And a guy who when
in his 20s couldn't hold a glass in his hand because his hand shook
so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``People would say to me, ``you're shaking like someone 70 years
old.'' My answer was they'd be shaking too if they owed as much
money as I did. But from that, to come to Dallas, and face the
level of heat both Jimmy and I received, and then to have the
success, Jimmy is always going to be someone special to me. Just
for what we went through together, how could he not be.''
</P>
<P>
   To Jerry, the breakup with Jimmy was all about ``the time had
come for both of us.'' And Jerry, of course, also doesn't buy into
the common theory that by parting with Jimmy, it cost at least one
more Super Bowl and maybe two.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good argument,'' he admitted, ``but would having Jimmy
have made any difference in the championship game in San Francisco
(in 1994) when we spotted them 21 quick points? Or if Jimmy had
been here, would we have had homefield for that game? It's all
speculation. Then the next year, we won the Super Bowl again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The run we went on was three Super Bowls in four seasons.
Could it have been any better than that? I just don't necessarily
think so. I certainly don't look back and wonder about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But then Jerry added something strange. ``Remember this,'' he
said. ``Sometimes it's very positive for both coaches and
columnists to move on to another opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   I wonder what he meant by that?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yeah. One other thing _ the Dallas Cowboys and Miami
Dolphins are scheduled to play a football game Thursday afternoon
at Texas Stadium. But due to other circumstances involved in this
encounter, honk if you actually care about the game itself. nn

HOODING THE EXECUTIONER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, November 28, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Political leaders in Florida are pondering whether to scrap
their rickety, 1923-era vintage electric chair for a neater, more
orderly way of putting criminals to death. But sanitizing the death
penalty with lethal injections does not make it any less barbaric.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's electric chair has been an embarrassment to both
opponents and supporters of capital punishment. Three times in
recent years it has malfunctioned; hoods covering the faces of the
condemned have burst into flames, and this summer a man contorted
horribly, hemorrhaging blood from his nostrils. After the power was
turned off, witnesses say, he was still alive.
</P>
<P>
   The latest outrage provoked the US Supreme Court to put a stay
on executions in Florida while it considers whether the electric
chair constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. The court's
decision could spell the end of electrocutions in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Florida's Governor Jeb Bush, an enthusiastic
supporter of capital punishment, has said he may call a special
session of the state Legislature to consider replacing the chair
with lethal injection, the preferred method of execution in 34
states. Lethal injection imparts a certain gloss of legitimacy to a
fundamentally inhumane act. It has been condemned as unethical by
the American Medical Association and by physicians' groups around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Those who wish to tidy up the death penalty don't want to
confront the horrible reality of what they are sanctioning, which
is the deliberate execution of men, women, and, increasingly,
children by the state. The method used _ firing squad, hanging, gas
chamber, electric current, or intravenous injection _ is just a
detail.
</P>
<P>
   Some in Florida and elsewhere want to keep the electric chair
precisely because of its brutality, saying convicted killers should
be made to suffer. That view lifts the pious veil from ``humane
executions'' to describe what capital punishment is really about:
not deterrence, not restitution, not justice, but revenge.

PERILOUS PIPE DREAM IN ASIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, November 28, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a pride that may eventually look like hubris, President
Clinton announced an agreement in Istanbul earlier this month on
construction of an oil pipeline to carry that precious resource
from the port of Baku on the Caspian Sea, across Georgia, and then
through Turkey to the Turkish port of Ceyhan on the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   The accord, which hardly guarantees that such a pipeline will
actually be built, represents the culmination of a strenuous
campaign by the administration to persuade Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan,
Georgia, and Turkey to join forces with the United States in a
project that was molded even more by strategic designs than by the
lure of profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major foreign policy victory,'' crowed Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson at the signing ceremony. ``It is a
strategic agreement that advances America's national interest.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no denying that the Baku-to-Ceyhan pipeline accord
represents a short-term victory for the members of the
administration who labored to bring it about, but it is less
certain that the strategic rationale behind it will serve long-term
US interests. That rationale is simple: to deprive Russia of a
traditional sphere of influence and preclude an Iranian role in the
exporting of the region's energy resources.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of states in the region that were until recently
Soviet republics are only too glad to have a new superpower
protector that can shield them against a revival of Russian
imperialism. By contrast, international oil companies, motivated
principally by cost-benefit calculations, would prefer to build a
pipeline that runs southward through Iran to a port on the Persian
Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   The statesmen would be more likely to achieve durable strategic
benefits if they heeded the purely cost-conscious thinking of the
oil company executives.
</P>
<P>
   To foresee the consequences of excluding Russia from a Caspian
oil and gas bonanza, Clinton need only cast an eye on Chechnya. A
pipeline already runs through Chechen territory, and it is no
secret that one of Moscow's prime motives for seeking to recapture
Chechnya is to take control of that pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow is sending two crude messages via its bombing and
shelling of civilians whom it defines as Russian citizens. The
first is that the Chechnya pipeline can be accounted secure once it
is back in Russian hands. The second message is even more ominous
but no less important to understand.
</P>
<P>
   By making war against the Chechens, Boris Yeltsin's regime
demonstrates to the new states around the Caspian that the Kremlin
is willing to take the most extreme measures to prevent any
possibility that Russia, in its temporary weakness, might be
prevented from sharing in the riches associated with the transport
of Caspian oil and gas.
</P>
<P>
   As brutal as Yeltsin's second war for Chechnya has been, the
leaders who toasted the pipeline accord in Istanbul should realize
that Yeltsin could be succeeded by someone who will be even less
solicitous of international opinion and more willing to give free
rein to great-power chauvinism.
</P>
<P>
   No matter who follows Yeltsin, the chances are that a policy of
making the export of Caspian energy resources an exclusive preserve
of the United States and its ally Turkey will become a formula for
perpetual instability in the Caucasus. It is folly to act on the
assumption that Russian leaders, or their counterparts in Iran,
will merely resign themselves to an American fait accompli.
</P>
<P>
   To paraphrase Che Guevara, they are much more likely to create
two, three, many Chechnyas. Indeed, there have already been blatant
examples of Moscow stoking ethnic conflicts and independence
struggles across the Caucasus. The aim is to make Russia the
indispensable power in its old backyard. Like a Mafia don with an
interest in his old neighborhood, whoever sits in the Kremlin will
want to ``wet his beak'' in any profitable activity emanating from
the Caspian.
</P>
<P>
   If there turn out to be enough oil and gas reserves in the
Caspian basin to make the region a geopolitical prize, then for
economic as well as strategic reasons there will have to be several
pipelines. They can run north through Russia, west through Georgia
to Turkey, and south through Iran to the Persian Gulf. Eventually
there may even be a gas pipeline that runs through Afghanistan and
eastward toward China. If the powers around the region share in the
pipeline profits, they will have a stake in preserving regional
stability. If not, they are certain to provoke the equivalent of
gang warfare.

SLOWDOWN IN SEATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Monday, November 29, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is a sad comment on the nature of international trade
negotiations these days that the most favorable outcome of the
World Trade Organization conference beginning Tuesday in Seattle
could be simply the status quo. While the conference should endorse
another round of talks designed to ease barriers to trade in a
number of fields, the political realities in many countries make it
increasingly difficult for them to embrace still freer
international commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Protectionist impulses are difficult to stifle and occur in
virtually all countries. Europeans, with a long history of
encouraging (and benefiting from) international trade, dampen their
ardor when their farmers are involved _ to the disadvantage of
their consumers. The United States, the world's largest single
importer and exporter, clings to elaborate quota systems to shield
steel, textile, and clothing manufacturers. Japan, a demon exporter
itself, constantly scatters administrative barriers in front of
potential imports.
</P>
<P>
   Given the will, delegates could endorse detailed negotiations on
agriculture, intellectual property, manufactured goods, dumping
practices, apparel, and a host of topics on the meeting's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   On a broader scale, they could back the next round of full-scale
trade negotiations projected at the end of the last round in 1993.
Those Uruguay Round talks took seven years to complete _ an index
of their complexity and of the difficulty in satisfying competing
interests.
</P>
<P>
   The international trading system, however, is the target of
almost constant shortsighted sniping from all directions. Some of
the criticisms touch on valid issues _ the environment, widely
varying wage and labor practices, health questions _ but many of
them cloak hostility to the increasingly international nature of
economic activity.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the system's flaws, growing international trade holds
by far the best hope for expanding the economic well-being of
people everywhere, especially in the poorer nations still left far
behind. The Seattle delegates owe them all the resolve to keep
moving ahead.

KINGS' STORR A QUICK HEALER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The day after an injury can be the most telling for a
player. Kings goaltender Jamie Storr, who nearly tore his right
groin in Tuesday's 5-2 victory, said Wednesday his condition had
improved.
</P>
<P>
   Storr, injured in the first period, still did not dress for the
Kings game against Dallas. But after icing and stretching the groin
throughout the day, Storr's groin improved and so did his mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt a lot better,'' said Storr, who was named NHL Player
of the Week earlier this month after taking over for injured
Stephane Fiset. ``I still can't play, but a lot of the pain is
gone. I didn't' expect it to feel this good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings are off for Thanksgiving today, but Storr will
continue to rehabilitate the injury at an optional therapy session
at the Forum. Fiset still is two weeks away with a deep bone bruise
on his right hand and Marcel Cousineau started in goal in
Wednesday's 3-2 overtime loss to Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Mike O'Neill, who arrived from the minor-league Long Beach Ice
Dogs on Wednesday afternoon, served as the Kings backup goalie.
</P>
<P>
   ``We obviously are very pleased that Jamie is getting better and
that is why we did not put him on injured reserve,'' Kings coach
Andy Murray said. ``We didn't want to put him out with the chance
he could be back for Saturday's game (vs. San Jose).''
</P>
<P>
   Karalahti sent down? Without Storr, Finnish defenseman Jere
Karalahti, who finally arrived last week after a lengthy battle
with immigration, was sent down to make room for O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   But that was only part of the story. Karalahti, whose arrival
was delayed because of legal wrangling over his history of drug
abuse, was with the Kings but couldn't fly back to join Long Beach
because he did not have the required picture I.D. for commercial
air travel.
</P>
<P>
   John Wolf, assistant to Kings general manager Dave Taylor, had
Karalahti's birth certificate back in Los Angeles, but obviously it
did not have a picture.
</P>
<P>
   So although he was technically a member of the Ice Dogs,
Karalahti remained with the Kings until they chartered home after
Wednesday's game. Players are not required to have picture
identification for charter flights.
</P>
<P>
   Karalahti was expected to join one of the Kings' minor-league
clubs after he arrived, but Murray decided to keep him with the
club to evaluate his conditioning. Karalahti has practiced
regularly with the club since his arrival Nov.15 but has not
played.
</P>
<P>
   Karalahti has regularly been tested for substance abuse since
his arrest two years ago for possession of heroin. After undergoing
a nine-month rehabilitation, he developed into the finest
defenseman in Europe when the Kings signed him last summer.
</P>
<P>
   No.2 goalie: O'Neill, who has 21 games of NHL experience,
arrived Wednesday afternoon but did not work out because the Kings
canceled their morning practice. O'Neill started in goal Sunday for
Long Beach in Houston. He was scheduled to accompany the Ice Dogs
to Salt Lake City for a game Wednesday when he got the call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard from them about 10 o'clock last night and got here at
2:30 this afternoon,'' O'Neill said. ``It was the busiest day of
the year at the airports and it sure was crowded. But this is your
chance and you want to make the most of it. You don't think about
the inconveniences. You only think about playing your best if you
get the chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille getting closer: Luc Robitaille tested his broken left
foot for the third consecutive day, skating for more than 30
minutes at the club's training facility in West Hills. Robitaille,
who might be back by the Dec. 3 game in Anaheim, was put through
simulated game conditions and reported no discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille and Murray will work out today at the Forum. If
Robitaille is ready to go for Saturday's game against San Jose,
Murray wants to hold him out because the team has the next five
days off.

<P>
   Washington's role as arbiter in the recurrent quarrel between
the governments in Beijing and Taipei resembles that of a policeman
called in to prevent a domestic spat from turning violent.
</P>
<P>
   The intervening constable must see to it that Beijing does not
carry out its threats and ceases trying to intimidate Taiwan. But
Washington's interest in preserving a neighborhood's tranquility
also requires it to prevent Taiwan from provoking the Beijing bully
into an irrational act.
</P>
<P>
   In the current issue of Foreign Affairs, Taiwan's President Lee
Teng-hui staked out that democracy's position on entering into a
political dialogue with mainland authorities. It is a position the
Communists in Beijing abhor, but it has certain undeniable virtues,
among which is a lucid recognition of reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is fiction to claim that the Chinese nation is not divided
_ and pernicious fiction to assert that the People's Republic of
China has any right or imperative to claim sovereignty over
Taiwan,'' Lee wrote. His purpose is to avoid a negotiation whose
outcome is predetermined by the ground rules for dialogue. If the
negotiations are conducted between one sovereign state and a
``renegade province'' belonging to that state, then the destination
of the dialogue is a foregone conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   From Beijing's perspective, however, Lee's demand that the
dialogue be conducted on the basis of ``special state-to-state
relations'' also prejudges the outcome. The Communists will not
participate in a dialogue that could lead to recognition of Taiwan
as an independent state.
</P>
<P>
   Since the reality is that Taiwan and the mainland are
intertwined economically and that both stand to suffer considerably
from any violent conflict, the United States should be able to
prevail on them to put aside semantic arguments about the status of
the parties to a dialogue. Let them negotiate as equals but not as
two states. This is one world crisis that is best handled by
solving small problems and procrastinating about the big ones _
until there is a democratic state on the mainland that is worthy of
absorbing Taiwan.

   NEW YORK _ A security guard at the Empire State Building was
arrested Wednesday night after a 14-year-old boy from Georgia told
the authorities that the guard had sexually abused him in a
stairwell, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, who was visiting the building with a tour group, became
separated from his companions around 6 p.m. and found himself in a
stairwell three flights below the 86th-floor observation deck, said
Detective Robert Samuel, a police department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   There, the boy told the police, he was confronted by the guard,
Taher Patwary. The boy told the police that Patwary touched him
above the waist and made suggestive comments, Samuel said.
</P>
<P>
   The boy then walked away, took the elevator down to the lobby,
found his group and reported the incident to them and to a police
officer. Patwary, 43, of Brooklyn, was arrested and charged with
second-degree sexual abuse and endangering the welfare of a child,
both misdemeanors, Samuel said.
</P>
<P>
   Patwary's brother, Abdul Rob, said that Patwary had arrived from
Bangladesh 10 years ago and had been working at the Empire State
Building for five months.
</P>
<P>
   The police said that Patwary had no prior arrests.

`FEARSOME RIVALS' KNOW WHAT'S IMPORTANT
</HEADLINE>
 12 FOOTBALL REPORT-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ryan Nunez heard the horrible news and raced for the telephone.
It was 6 a.m., but the Texas wide receiver needed to set his mind
at ease.
</P>
<P>
   He called the College Station apartment of Will Blackbird, a
childhood chum and Texas A&AMP;M student. Multiple rings, no answer.
</P>
<P>
   Nunez redialed. Same result. He began to panic.
</P>
<P>
   Logically, Nunez realized the odds were against his buddy being
one of the students injured or killed during the collapse of the
A&AMP;M bonfire tower. But he knew it was possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bothered me, having a friend over there and knowing it
could have been him (among the casualties),'' Nunez said. ``It was
a very disturbing feeling. I couldn't imagine how parents might
have felt in the same situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, this story has a happy ending. The two friends
eventually made contact. Blackbird was safe. He plans to be in Kyle
Field on Friday when Nunez and the seventh-ranked Longhorns (9-2,
6-1) meet No. 24 A&AMP;M (7-3, 4-3). A thankful reunion beckons, one
day after Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Words cannot adequately sum up the profound sadness of the
tragedy that cost 12 A&AMP;M students their lives when the 40-foot
bonfire tower toppled Nov. 18. But they can be used to call
attention to the underlying message in the Nunez-Blackbird
situation: Deep down, Longhorns care about Aggies. And vice versa.
Especially in trying times.
</P>
<P>
   That's been proven in the past week through blood drives, unity
rallies, prayer vigils and supportive calls placed between friends
and loved ones from both sides of this rivalry. In situations such
as this, labels fade. And we are reminded, once again, that when
you take away the maroon or orange jerseys, you are left with
people who share many of the same hopes, fears, dreams and values.
</P>
<P>
   You're left with a lot of Texans whose hearts are in direct
proportion to the size of their home state. You're left with
citizens who are quick to help in a crisis, regardless of rooting
interest.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't believe that, listen to Texas A&AMP;M offensive guard
Semisi Heimuli. A Trinity High School graduate, Heimuli lived in
suburban San Francisco until moving to Euless as a teen-ager in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   He experienced the 1989 earthquake that rocked San Francisco and
interrupted the World Series between the San Francisco Giants and
Oakland Athletics. And he saw the tragedy that unfolded last week
at the Aggie Bonfire. What he'll never forget is the differing
reactions to both events: chaos at one, caring at the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the earthquake, people started looting. All they
worried about was getting something for themselves. No one pitched
in to help,'' Heimuli said. ``Since I've lived in Texas, I've
noticed this state is different. In hard times, people help each
other out. It's a Texas thing.''
</P>
<P>
   No group of Texans, said Heimuli, have been more persistent in
offering comfort and condololences to the Aggies than the
Longhorns. A&AMP;M linebacker Brian Gamble echoed that sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot for someone to be able to console the people
you're supposed to hate. But that's what we've been seeing for the
past week, so you can forget about hate,'' Gamble said, referring
to Texas students. ``They came to our memorial services. They held
one of their own. They've really supported us, and I thought it was
great. And we'd have done the same for them if the tables were
turned.''
</P>
<P>
   In a heartbeat, added A&AMP;M cornerback Jason Webster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never hated Texas,'' Webster said. ``It's an intense
rivalry, sure. But I'm not surprised they've sent their support.
I'm thankful.''
</P>
<P>
   This rivalry works because of mutual respect, not hatred. At
least, that's how players and coaches see it. It's how the
countless families with loyalties to both sides see it. Hopefully,
A&AMP;M and Texas players said, that's how the world will see it once
they finish Friday's contest.
</P>
<P>
   Like his A&AMP;M peers, Texas quarterback Major Applewhite said he
would dedicate Friday's game to the A&AMP;M students who perished at
the bonfire site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why can't we play for the same things they play for? It's a
tragedy we all share,'' Applewhite said. ``There are lives
involved. It only seems right to play in a spirit to honor the
traditions of this rivalry on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, look for Applewhite and Webster _ leaders in
their school's respective Fellowship of Christian Athletes chapters
_ to gather players from both teams in a postgame prayer as a show
of unity before leaving the field. Look for former high school
teammates to embrace and cry, one wearing maroon, the other orange.
Look for evidence, in the words of A&AMP;M student body president Will
Hurd that ``We have seen the most fearsome of rivals become the
best of friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Look for the youth of America, once again, to remind the rest of
us about putting life and football in their proper perspectives.
With football finishing a distant second. FOR TEXAS COACH, ADVICE
FROM TRAGEDY HITS HOME
</P>
<P>
   Texas coach Mack Brown found himself struggling with what to
tell his team in the wake of the bonfire tragedy. That changed
after a phone call with former A&AMP;M athletic director John David
Crow, whose son died in a car wreck three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``John David said to tell the kids that every time you see your
family members or your friends, be sure you hug them and tell them
that you love them. Never leave one of them upset because you may
not see them again,'' Brown said. ``Death is final. You have a
chance to grow as a person if you can take this crisis and put your
own priorities in order.''
</P>
<P>
   In essence, Brown said, he parroted Crow's sentiments to his
players. And he took them to heart. He recalled that, in his final
conversation with his late father, the elder Brown asked Mack to
fax him a document to settle a disagreement he was having with a
friend. His father had an agitated tone to his voice, and the
conversation ended abruptly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since, I've always wished I could've had one more
conversation with my dad, one last chance to say, `I love you,'''
Brown said. ``When John David mentioned the part about never
hanging up mad with a loved one, that really came back to me.
That's good advice.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, it has been passed along to more than just Brown's football
players.
QUICK HITS RED RAIDERS IN LIMBO
</P>
<P>
   Because of an unclear future, Texas Tech coach Spike Dykes did
not have his team practice this week and will mandate only
conditioning workouts when players reconvene Monday. The Red
Raiders (6-5) are bowl-eligible. But so are six other Big 12
schools, and the league is assured of only six postseason berths.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Tech finds itself in college football's equivalent
of no-man's land. Players have no remaining games on the schedule
but will not know until Dec. 5 if they are done for the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surely, somebody will take us to a bowl game, won't they?''
said Dykes, who announced his retirement after a 38-28 victory
Saturday over Oklahoma. ``I know there are a lot of teams going,
but I feel like we'll be one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   If Tech lands a bowl bid, Dykes and his current staffers will
handle the game, Tech athletic director Gerald Myers said.
BEAR NECESSITIES
</P>
<P>
   To avoid a repeat of this year's 1-10 season, the next edition
of the Baylor Bears will need a thicker skin. Coach Kevin Steele
said he may have erred on the side of positive feedback in his
initial season, rather than challenging the team as much as it
needed.
</P>
<P>
   That will change in 2000, Steele said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our greatest struggle was not talent or ability. It was the
psyche of the football team,'' said Steele, who vows to be more
direct about shortcomings in future discussions with players.
</P>
<P>
   Why didn't he do that in 1999?
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd have lost some players because of the mental psyche of
the team,'' Steele said. ``I still believe this year's team
couldn't have handled it. Next year's team is going to have to be
able to handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   PEERS DON'T ENVY SLOCUM
</P>
<P>
   Big 12 coaches expressed sympathy for everyone at Texas A&AMP;M in
the wake of last week's tragedy at the bonfire site. None said he
would relish the task of preparing a team to play against that
backdrop, as coach R.C. Slocum must do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be a tough week. Our hearts go out to the whole A&AMP;M
family,'' Kansas coach Terry Allen said. ``Having dealt with deaths
of family members and other players, I've found that (playing a
game) is three hours where we can put it in the back of our minds,
put aside the tragedy and go play. It can be therapeutic. I hope it
will be for them.''
</P>
<P>
   BURCH'S PICKS
</P>
<P>
   Staff writer Jimmy Burch picks (against the line) this week's
Big 12 football games:
</P>
<P>
   Texas at Texas A&AMP;M (plus 2 1/2). Pick: Texas. An upset is
possible. But bank on Texas' consistency to outlast A&AMP;M's emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska (plus 14 1/2) at Colorado. Pick: Colorado. If the
Cornhuskers don't cure their fumblitis, this may not be their
steppingstone to San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State (plus 13) at Oklahoma. Pick: Oklahoma. Sooners
burst the Cowboys' bowl bubble in convincing fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's record: 2-1-1. Season record: 50-31-2.
INSIDE THE NUMBERS
</P>
<P>
   0 _ Road losses by Texas, the Big 12's only unbeaten road team
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   3 _ Touchdowns on interception returns by A&AMP;M's Michael Jameson,
a Big 12 season record.
</P>
<P>
   4 _ Victories by Baylor in 1996, which led to the firing of
coach Chuck Reedy.
</P>
<P>
   5 _ Victories in three seasons by Reedy's successors, Dave
Roberts and Kevin Steele.
</P>
<P>
   10 _ Games with a 50-yard average by A&AMP;M punter Shane Lechler,
who is on pace to set the NCAA record for career average (44.7).
</P>
<P>
   31 _ Sacks by Texas defense in the final 23 games under coach
John Mackovic.
</P>
<P>
   79 _ Sacks by Texas defense in first 23 games under coach Mack
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   311 _ Yards allowed by Colorado in its past two games, the
school's best two-game total since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   45,894 _ Texas Tech's average home attendance in 1999, a school
record. nn

KID KINGS COME UP SHORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The Dallas Stars had the Stanley Cup in the lobby and
an unbeaten streak almost five years old. The Kings had the Long
Beach Ice Dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Andy Murray didn't mind those odds, taking a team
overloaded with minor-leaguers against the Stars, who haven't lost
to the Kings in 19 games. Hard work beats style points in his mind
even if the Stars beat the Kings 3-2 in overtime Wednesday night in
front of 17,001 at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Murray started Marcel Cousineau in goal a day after Jamie Storr
went down with a groin injury and two weeks after he was called up
from the minors to replace injured Stephane Fiset. Cousineau had a
tie game until Richard Matvichuk poked in his own rebound with 2:55
gone in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Murray got goals from Jason Blake, who has taken the Blue Train
to and from Long Beach several times this season, and Len Barrie,
who played with the Ice Dogs until Jozef Stumpel was lost to
abdominal surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course you want to win, especially with the effort we gave
the night after the win in Colorado,'' Murray said. ``But we got a
point out of this (for the tie in regulation) and three points for
the trip. It was good to see those guys really step up. I think
they know how I felt by the numbers of minutes they got.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray didn't see that jump in the Kings power play, which was 0
for 4 and is scoreless in its last 28 opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   But he saw plenty in Blake, who played a season-high 16 minutes.
He had four shots on Stars' goalie Ed Belfour, who stopped 19 shots
and held the Kings (13-7-4) without a scoring chance in overtime.
Blake also got playing time with the first unit, a group he hoped
to join when Luc Robitaille went down two weeks ago with a broken
left foot.
</P>
<P>
   Blake was overwhelmed by Philadelphia in the one game he played
on that line, and shuttled in and out of Long Beach to stay in
shape. It obviously paid off. Blake now has two goals in the last
two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a game where we needed the fresh legs,'' captain Rob
Blake said.
</P>
<P>
   And not just because they played in Colorado the night before.
The Kings hadn't defeated the Stars since April 6, 1995. They were
0-6 last year, including five losses by one goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars, now 9-10-3 but still last in the Pacific Division,
also are banged up. They have been doing more whining than winning
in defense of their championship, but Wednesday they looked like
they might have an easy night.
</P>
<P>
   The weary Kings came out flat and Dallas left winger Mike Keane
scored a short-handed goal just 1:08 into the game. After Stars'
defenseman Darryl Sydor was whistled off for interference, Keane
picked up the puck along the right board and fired a cross-ice pass
to captain Derian Hatcher.
</P>
<P>
   Cousineau stopped Hatcher's wrist shot, but Keane got the
rebound and gave the Stars a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Barrie tied the game midway through the first period by
rebounding a Ziggy Palffy shot past Belfour. It was Barrie's only
shot of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings looked like they might get out of the period with just
one goal, but Jamie Langenbrunner gave the Stars a 2-1 lead with
just 3:21 to play on a power-play goal. Blake came back to tie the
game with 12:29 left in the second and it lasted until overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't nervous,'' said Cousineau, who probably will be back
in goal Saturday against San Jose. ``This is a chance for me. It's
a chance for a lot of guys.''

NETS ARE FEELING BETTER AFTER DOSE OF WARRIORS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ The New Jersey Nets ran into the perfect
pick-me-up Wednesday night at the Arena in Oakland. Instead of
meeting a group of high-flying, fancy-passing, sweet-shooting
gamers, they faced the Golden State Warriors, a West Coast crew
that is as injured as it is hapless. It was just what a loser of
seven straight games needed.
</P>
<P>
   Behind one of their most balanced performances of the season,
the Nets beat the Warriors, 92-84, to improve to 2-10 and replace
their sullen expressions with smiles, if only for a night.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Van Horn, who started at small forward, and Johnny Newman,
who came off the bench, led the Nets with 22 points apiece, while
Stephon Marbury followed with 21. Coincidentally, the Nets'
victories have come in the only two games in which Marbury has not
led them in scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Farmer paced Golden State with 19 points, and Antawn
Jamison had 17.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets did not outdistance the Warriors (2-8) by much. Leading
by 64-63 after three quarters, they surged ahead, 78-68, midway
through the period. But Golden State closed within 80-75 and the
crowd of 10,017 began smelling a rare victory. Marbury gave the
Nets some room by sinking a 3-pointer with former Knick John Starks
hanging on him with 4 minutes 2 seconds to play. Marbury hit the
ensuing free throw to put the Nets up, 84-75.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the Warriors rallied, moving within 88-84 with less than
a minute to play, but Elliot Perry (nine points) hit an 18-footer
in transition to push the lead back to six points with 36 seconds
left.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets began with their fifth starting lineup of this young
season. Jim McIlvaine (corneal abrasion, right eye) and Sherman
Douglas (sprained right ankle), both casualties of Tuesday's loss
to Sacramento, sat out, and Kendall Gill went on the injured list
before the game with a bruised bone in his left foot.
</P>
<P>
   All of that cleared the way for 37-year-old Michael Cage, who
was activated from the injured list Wednesday , to start at center.
Along with Marbury, Van Horn and Cage, Lucious Harris and Jamie
Feick rounded out the first five.
</P>
<P>
   Golden State was playing without its second-leading scorer,
Chris Mills (left Achilles' tendinitis), Erick Dampier (left knee)
and Jason Caffey (right Achilles' tendinitis).
</P>
<P>
   What would usually be categorized as a meaningless game between
noncontenders became a heated confrontation with plenty on the
line. Because of each club's precarious start to the season, Gary
Fitzsimmons, the Warriors' assistant general manager, was saying
beforehand: ``It's Game 7! It's Game 7!''
</P>
<P>
   It certainly was a must-win situation for both teams. After
playing the Nets, 10 of the Warriors' next 11 games are against
sure-fire playoff teams, while the Nets visit the Los Angeles
Lakers on Friday and Phoenix on Saturday. Then, after playing
Washington on Tuesday, the Nets will play host to San Antonio, the
Knicks Sacramento and Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   It was evident early on that the Nets were not on the floor with
a superior team. Whereas the Nets had been outclassed on many
occasions, the Warriors appeared to be perhaps a notch below them.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets' biggest advantage was on the backboards, where they
outrebounded the Warriors, 54-43. It was clear how sad Golden
State's rebounding corps was when Cage grabbed four in the first
two minutes and finished with 10 in 14 minutes. Van Horn led the
Nets with 11 rebounds. Johnny Newman, who pulled down three
straight offensive rebounds on one sequence, had 10.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their dominance on the glass, the Nets trailed, 22-21,
after one quarter because of a familiar problem: poor transition
defense. On the rare occasion it did secure a rebound, Golden State
ran with ease, scoring 16 first-half points in transition.
</P>
<P>
   After falling behind 26-21, the Nets charged, putting together a
13-0 run to take brief command. Harris got hot, scoring eight of
his 10 first-half points, and hit a 21-footer to give the Nets
their biggest lead, 48-36, three minutes before intermission.
</P>
<P>
   But a couple of late turnovers, including two by Marbury,
allowed the Warriors to remain in contention and pull within 51-45
at the break. Van Horn had 14 points and Marbury 11 before the
break.

EDITORIAL: JUDGE KAYE'S COURT REFORMS  
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Nov. 25:
</P>
<P>
   In her six years as New York's chief judge, Judith Kaye has been
proved a dedicated and effective reformer of the state's sprawling
court system. Each of her hard-won changes has had a positive
impact _ whether it be the repeal of automatic exemptions from jury
service that let many citizens escape their civic duty, various
physical improvements in court facilities, or innovations like the
creation of specialized courts to better handle domestic violence
and nonviolent drug cases. All this has justly earned Judge Kaye
national recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month she was honored at an event in Washington
sponsored by the National Center for State Courts and attended by
several Supreme Court justices and other legal luminaries. ``There
are many who are working hard to better process the many cases that
come before the state courts,'' the president of the state court
group, Roger Warren, observed in his remarks, ``but there are few
working any harder or more successfully to better serve the people
who use the state courts.''
</P>
<P>
   The event was also a reminder of how much more Judge Kaye could
accomplish if she had better cooperation from the state
Legislature. Lawmakers continue their dawdling over the sensible
court reorganization plan she submitted almost three years ago, as
well as her proposal to finally end the mandatory sequestration of
deliberating juries in all but death-penalty cases _ a costly
boondoggle that results in needless inconvenience to jurors. Judge
Kaye has made it her priority to improve the administration of
justice in New York. But she cannot do it alone.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Nov. 25:
</P>
<P>
   There is no precise form of words for giving thanks. The number
of place-settings depends on the weather, on long-distance travel
plans and last-minute arrivals. The menu is only partly
foreordained by custom. Once, the turkey was stuffed with cornbread
instead of chestnuts, and now the idea of cornbread stuffing seems
almost venerable. As the years pass, the dinner hour drifts from
early afternoon to early evening and back again. The setting shifts
from house to house as the family grows older, younger, more
scattered. It is even hard to say just who is indispensable at this
feast, for memory has a way of bringing everyone _ living and dead,
present and absent _ into company at the table.
</P>
<P>
   Yet these variations, these adaptations, raise a sentiment of
surprising consistency on this holiday, as coherent and resonant as
if there were indeed a changeless form of words to be spoken, a
prescribed menu. The grace-sayers and toast-makers try hard to
convey the blessings of the day, but their phrases nearly always
fall short, an acknowledgment that holiday feelings are a little
hard to put into words. Everyone at the table, however, knows
without saying how Thanksgiving should feel. They know that if the
welcome is warm, thanks will follow, as surely as the sound of the
dishwasher follows dessert.
</P>
<P>
   Someone down the table is stern about the tradition of
Thanksgivings past, unforgiving, in fact, about the cornbread
stuffing. Someone else is mourning the loss of an ordinary
Thursday, straining to find some corner of the afternoon that is
just its normal self, untouched by formality. The children are
distracted by each other. A pertinacious uncle watches the sweet
potatoes go round the table, hoping for seconds and thirds. A
nervous sister-in-law watches them too, because the recipe is hers.
The man with the carving knife looks composed, but only because he
knows that the secret to disbursing a turkey is faking it, though
he still believes that his father knew what he was doing. No one is
quite pure of heart. None of them know quite what to do with their
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   And yet it does not matter. For at some point you look up to
discover that the meal has enclosed everyone at the table. The day
seems different than it did a half-hour ago, as though the outer
world suddenly fell away for a moment, leaving only the momentary
intimacy of a circle of friends and family, all facing each other
over the growing disarray of the dinner table. Before they know it,
all those present are caught in the improvisation of their
feelings. Every November, Thanksgiving is reinvented in just this
manner. We pull it out of thin air. We watch it gather in front of
us and then, because a feeling so rich and supple cannot be
sustained for long, we watch it vanish until it is time to reinvent
the day all over again next year. &QL;

BAD BOUNCE STILL HAUNTS CELTICS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are 16 green-and-white championship banners hanging from
the rafters of the house. The first one was raised in 1957. The
last one found its place in 1986. The 17th banner, which would have
been earned last June, was stolen.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. The Celtics had a title stolen from them one
Sunday afternoon two years ago in New Jersey. They were betrayed by
a plastic ball in a bin. They wanted the ball to bounce left and it
went right. In those few inches, the Celtics and their fans would
say goodbye and hello to players to whom they never would have said
hello or goodbye if the larceny hadn't occurred. You've heard of
being a year or two away from a title? The Celtics were an inch or
two away.
</P>
<P>
   But this is the worst news: In those few seconds, the Celtics
had their 17th championship delayed by, at least, one year. They,
not the San Antonio Spurs, would have won it last season if their
pockets hadn't been picked. They were slugged by the aftereffects
of that thievery Wednesday night. Even the main character in this
tale, Tim Duncan, understands the details of the robbery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was going to Boston,'' Duncan said. ``I had
articles pinned up in my dorm room. Everyone said the Celtics were
going to be the worst team and that they would pick me first. I had
people in Boston trying to find a place for me to live.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics were the worst team in the East. They won 15 games,
only one in their division, and finished a staggering 46 games out
of first place. Duncan probably had his bags packed before watching
the 1997 draft lottery on television. His life changed when he sat
in front of his TV and ``I saw that the Celtics got (draft picks) 3
and 6. I was thinking, `Oh (expletive).' ''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't the only one thinking that. M.L. Carr was the Celtics'
representative that afternoon in Secaucus, N.J. I watched Carr's
reaction when the picks were announced, and to this day I have
never seen a man of color lose his color as fast as Carr did. He
didn't even look real as he sat there. He appeared to be a
life-sized portrait with an anguished half-smile painted on his
face. (That day, ``M.L.'' could have stood for ``Mona Lisa.'')
</P>
<P>
   Duncan and the Spurs played the Celtics Wednesday night at the
FleetCenter. Or maybe it's more accurate to say the Celtics were
played, 121-98. When Rick Pitino said that the Spurs ``kicked our
ass in every facet of the game,'' no one disagreed with him. Duncan
had 14 points, 6 rebounds, and 3 assists _ in the third quarter. He
finished with 31/15/4 numbers. If he were here, everything about
the Celtics would change. Pitino would be a different man, Antoine
Walker would be a different player, the Celtics would have a
revamped roster, and the Celtics would be champions. Not might be.
Would be.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-foot Duncan is averaging 21 points, 14 rebounds, and 3.3
assists. He is 23 years old. He doesn't think he has played his
best basketball yet. He dunks and he hits bank shots. He escaped a
triple-team Wednesday night with a spin move and layup. He responds
to trash talking by furiously releasing his entire repertoire.
</P>
<P>
   You ask him where he developed that spin move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh that?'' he said with a dismissive wave. ``I've always had
that.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a bizarre third-quarter sequence when Walker, his team
seemingly trailing by 50 points, went at Duncan. A foul was called,
Walker cursed and told a joke to injured Spur Jerome Kersey on the
bench. Walker didn't know it, but Duncan was glaring at him the
entire time. He clearly didn't want Walker to say anything to
anybody.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the Pitino-Walker marriage appears to be headed toward
the ``irreconcilable differences'' phase. Duncan here, wearing a
number other than 21 (it's retired in honor of Bill Sharman), could
have erased all pop psychology from the Celtics' family. Instead we
would be talking about the play, ``Tim, 'Toine, and Rick: A Love
Story.''
</P>
<P>
   With Duncan at center and Walker at either small or power
forward, Pitino would have two pillars for his first Celtics team.
It would change his view of a roster loaded with 10 free agents,
most of them marginal pros.
</P>
<P>
   Understand that Pitino was devastated by the events of May 18,
1997. That day began his Boston pattern of not saying what he truly
felt. During a teleconference, he said the Celtics were still in
good position. They weren't. The day of the lottery, Vancouver
general manager Stu Jackson was asked if he could see any scenario
in which the Spurs would trade Duncan. He shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that he had Duncan in tow, Pitino would have signed Rick
Fox and David Wesley. He still would have drafted Ron Mercer with
the sixth pick. He never would have uttered the name ``Travis
Knight'' or extended a $21 million contract to him. There would
have been no Millses, Edneys, Massenburgs, or McCartys. There would
have been Andrew DeClercq, on the Celtics bench. Kenny Anderson
would not be here and Pitino's son, Richard, would have never
developed a friendship with Chauncey Billups. Tony Battie would be
a Laker. Eric Williams would have never gone to Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan in Boston would have caused all that and helped the
Celtics win 43 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a handful of people who understand the game as well
as he does,'' 50-something Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said of
Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Tim. You're really good,'' a young fan shouted as the
Celtics' blowout was 40 seconds from being official.
</P>
<P>
   The only negative about having Duncan in Boston is that Paul
Pierce wouldn't be here with him. He would have been taken by the
team that Boston would have replaced in the 1997-98 playoffs (I say
New Jersey). The Celtics would have picked in the 14-19 range,
drafting from among guards Michael Dickerson and Bryce Drew and
forwards Matt Harpring and Pat Garrity. Instead of picking, though,
they would have traded out of the first round and moved Greg
Minor's contract in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Do you think Walker would have taken 21 shots (with 16 misses)
with Duncan in the lineup? Do you think the starting point guard
would have finished with only five assists with Duncan to pass to?
The Spurs got six assists from Chucky Brown and nine from Avery
Johnson. I think Johnson should have been credited with another
one. On one drive, he noticed Duncan trailing him so he lofted a
soft shot toward the rim. If it had gone in, great. If not, Duncan
would retrieve it (which is what happened).
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, the Celtics' 1998-99 lineup could have been: Wesley and
Mercer in the backcourt, Duncan at center, and Fox and Walker at
forward. Bench: Dana Barros, Williams, DeClercq, Adrian Griffin
(why not?), Dee Brown, Ruben Patterson (free agent signee), and
Pervis Ellison.
</P>
<P>
   There was no Michael Jordan last season. There was no one in the
playoffs who could stop Duncan. As he showed Wednesday night, most
people cannot stop him. He would have won a title in Boston if the
team had not been robbed in the broad New Jersey daylight.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Nov. 25:
</P>
<P>
   Thanksgiving weekend is a dangerous time to be on the road.
Experts estimate that roughly half of all traffic fatalities in the
next few days _ about 250 deaths and 13,000 injuries _ will be
attributable to drunken drivers. That is a much higher death rate
from drunken driving than for other weekends of the year. Still,
the overall annual numbers for alcohol-related deaths have declined
in recent years because of grass-roots education efforts by groups
like Mothers Against Drunk Driving and tougher laws against drunken
driving in most parts of the nation. In 1998, alcohol-related
driving deaths reached a record low of 15,935, down from about
28,000 in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Any rejoicing should be tempered, however, by the fact that the
downward trend in fatalities appears to be slowing, and there is
less political will to push forward with laws that could help save
more lives.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers Against Drunk Driving issued a national survey this week
rating all the states on their efforts at combating drunken
driving. California was rated best in the nation for reducing the
percentage of alcohol-related traffic deaths between 1995 and 1998
and for passing stricter laws, including one lowering the blood
alcohol limit to .08 percent from .10. Only 17 states and the
District of Columbia have adopted that lower level.
</P>
<P>
   New York state, with 365 alcohol-related deaths last year,
earned only a B- for its less aggressive law enforcement and
failure to adopt a .08 standard. Connecticut, New Jersey and
Massachusetts were rated even less favorably. Gov. George Pataki
has pushed to lower the limit in New York to .08, but has been
blocked in the state Legislature by the restaurant and liquor
industries. Likewise, the Clinton administration supported a
national standard of .08, which was approved in the Senate but was
not acted on by the House.
</P>
<P>
   There is debate about how much difference a lower blood alcohol
limit makes in reducing vehicle crashes. But drivers are
substantially impaired at .08, making that level a reasonable limit
to set. The lower level can be made even more effective with
increased enforcement, more education and stronger laws that revoke
licenses and increase penalties for repeat offenders. The battle
against drunken driving has not yet been won, and recent gains in
reducing fatalities are no reason to become complacent.

EDITORIAL: RACE AND GENDER IN THE MILITARY  
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Nov. 25:
</P>
<P>
   Harry Truman's 1948 executive order integrating the armed forces
created a black management class and got blacks and whites to live
and work together on relatively peaceful terms long before the
society as a whole was ready to tackle this issue. The military is
still well ahead of the private sector when it comes to
incorporating women and minorities into management positions. But a
pair of surveys released by the Pentagon this week revealed that,
though progress continues, racial friction is still a pressing
problem and prejudices based on race and gender remain a serious
obstacle to full integration of the officer corps.
</P>
<P>
   The data provided some reasons for optimism. For example, a
report on promotion rates showed that minority officers, who
constituted just 7 percent of the total officer corps in 1977, made
up 15.3 percent two decades later. Women have shown comparable
progress, going from under 6 percent of the officer corps 20 years
ago to more than 14 percent today.
</P>
<P>
   But women and minorities tend to be concentrated in
administrative and supply areas and underrepresented in tactical
operations, the area that yields two-thirds of the general and flag
officers in the services. The report takes special notice of
aviation _ ``a greatly valued path for officers'' _ noting that few
minorities are selected for flight school and that their attrition
rates are higher than those for whites. Part of the problem, the
report says, is that blacks and women tend to receive initial
assignments that give their careers ``a slow start'' and have
limited access to peer and mentor networks.
</P>
<P>
   The most distressing news comes from a survey of more than
40,000 service members showing that large numbers have experienced
racially offensive encounters, often with superiors. About a third
of the whites who responded and nearly half the blacks and Latinos
said the racial incidents had caused them to lose trust in their
fellow soldiers, undermining efforts to work effectively together.
About half the respondents said that nothing was done when the most
bothersome episodes were reported to superiors. Despite these
difficulties, however, 46 percent of all respondents said that race
relations were better in the military than in the nation as a
whole, versus 30 percent who said that the national picture was
more favorable.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon, which has taken pride in its progress on
integrating minorities and women into the services, has clearly
been embarrassed by this last group of findings. But now that the
obstacles to fuller integration and racial harmony have been
revealed, commanders can get busy finding ways to remove them.

beautiful blue parlor at Lockwood Farm, his 18th century Ulster
County retreat in New York State. Dugdale, 39, a fine art
photographer, tragically lost nearly all his sight after an
AIDS-related stroke six years ago. Yet he has much to celebrate
this Thanksgiving. Last Friday evening in Manhattan, he attended
the packed opening of an exhibition of his recent still lives,
nudes and portraits. And on Thanksgiving Day, Dugdale will have the

courageous odyssey of suffering and recovery, to their first

   HALLOWELL-CONNECTING (Cambridge, Mass.) _ On a Saturday morning
here, there is only one possible place to be, at least for parents
with children under 10. Dr. Edward M. Hallowell is at a soccer
game. His son Jack, 7, is playing for the Maroon team; his wife,
Sue Hallowell, is team manager. And because this is Cambridge,
ground zero for self-conscious parenting, every soccer team has
been taught to chant, ``One, two, three, four _ We don't care about
the score!'' Dr. Hallowell, 49, a psychiatrist, is the author of
``Connect,'' a book that argues the necessity of human
connectedness in the interest of health and happiness. So how does
he square connecting and competing? Even 8-and-under soccer, he

structures that materialize light, as though the finger of God were
making a divine point by marking space at a designated time. At
Josephine Withers's house outside Washington, the star of the show,
for the six months starting in September and ending in March, is
the sun, which peers in through the long, high clerestory window of
her two-story living room and strikes coated glass and mirrored
metals suspended from the ceiling. The work, by Janet Saad-Cook,

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's a streak of good health and good fortune that
defines A.C. Green as the NBA's King of Longevity, its Ironman. Yet
even as he advanced his record-setting string of consecutive games
Wednesday, Green lent another level of meaning to that Ironman
term.
</P>
<P>
   Outmuscled, and undersized by at least 30 pounds, Green played
Ironman against the Mailman, and his defense against Karl Malone
helped key the Lakers' 90-82 victory over the Utah Jazz at Staples
Center.
</P>
<P>
   The 36-year-old Green played his 1,041st consecutive game to tie
the professional basketball record in that category, but his most
significant contributions could be found in Malone's statistical
line: 23 field-goal attempts, nine made, 22 points.
</P>
<P>
   Green himself contributed just four points but pulled down nine
rebounds, yanked a few loose balls away from Malone and generally
disrupted his rhythm. Destroyed it, actually.
</P>
<P>
   So the Lakers, who surprised the Jazz with a 91-84 victory
opening night at the Delta Center, made it 2-0 against Utah. And
Green made it 2-0 against Malone, who struggled through a 4-for-10,
14-point night the last time they met.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's playing great,'' coach Phil Jackson said of Green prior
to tipoff. ``I'm really impressed with the effort he gives us. He's
not shooting the ball particularly well, but A.C.'s never been a
scorer, so I don't expect him to change overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   So leave the scoring to Shaquille O'Neal. He survived a poked
eye from Greg Ostertag and led the way with 39 points and 18
rebounds in another marathon, 40-minute performance. Glen Rice
added 21 points, and Derek Fisher chipped in 14.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers never trailed through three quarters and led 68-56
heading into the fourth quarter. But seven minutes later, the Jazz
had whittled it down to a one-point game, 71-70.
</P>
<P>
   Rice took the initiative, scoring five straight, and after he
missed a free throw, it was Green who saved the possession with the
rebound. Moments later, Green stole a John Stockton pass, leading
to a pair of O'Neal free throws at the other end, and a 10-point
lead with 2:39 to go.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing the Lakers lacked was a breakout performance from
the bench. After two weeks of being carried almost solely by
O'Neal, Rice and Fisher, Jackson hoped for better support from the
reserves Wednesday but didn't get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't think we have dedicated enough space to get
(them) comfortable _ like, OK, get ready, I'm going in in two
minutes, I can feel the coach is going to pull somebody and get me
in there _ so the guys get a rhythm of going in there and saying,
OK, I'm going to get my eight or 10 points to help the team or
whatever else I have to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a night-to-night kind of thing for us. But most of all,
we think that we're undermanned right now without Kobe (Bryant),
and we have to make up some things. And that's where the bench has
to do it, because we're drawing somebody off the bench to play
starter's minutes (in place of Bryant), in that process your bench
gets debilitated a little bit. It gets to be a liability for a
ballclub after a certain time.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the Lakers only needed their starters.
</P>
<P>
   A lively Lakers defense and slow-to-a-crawl offense helped them
to a nine-point halftime lead, despite barely scratching the
scoreboard themselves. O'Neal scored 17 points as the Lakers took a
38-29 lead into halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher also enjoyed a fast start, making 4 of 5 shots for nine
points as the Lakers shot 47.2 percent in the half. Among the
Lakers' usual stand-bys, only Rice struggled early, missing all
four shots from the field and going scoreless.
</P>
<P>
   The frustrated Jazz hit only 12 of 39 field-goal attempts (30.8
percent), and Malone was the only player to get untracked, with 11
points. Yet even he struggled, shooting 5 for 12 and committing
four turnovers.

GREEN DELIVERS FOR LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ An unparalleled streak of good health and good
fortune defines A.C. Green as the NBA's King of Longevity. Its
Ironman. Yet even as he advanced his record-setting string of
consecutive games Wednesday night, Green lended another level of
meaning to that term.
</P>
<P>
   Outmuscled and undersized by at least 30 pounds, Green played
Ironman to the NBA's Mailman, and his sturdy, stubborn defense
against Karl Malone helped key the Lakers' 90-82 victory over the
Utah Jazz at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   The 36-year-old Green played his 1,041st consecutive game, tying
the professional basketball record, but his most significant
contributions could be found in Malone's statistical line: 23
field-goal attempts, 9 made, 22 points, four turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Green himself contributed just four points but pulled down 10
rebounds, added three steals, yanked a few loose balls away from
Malone and generally disrupted his rhythm all night. Destroyed it,
actually.
</P>
<P>
   So the Lakers, who surprised the Jazz with a 91-84 victory
opening night at the Delta Center, made it 2-0 against Utah. And
Green made it 2-0 against Malone, who struggled through a 4-for-10,
14-point night the last time they met.
</P>
<P>
   ``His tenacity is just amazing,'' coach Phil Jackson said.
``This is a game which is kind of a hallmark game for him, having
played the number of consecutive games he's played.... A.C. has
been a big guy who's been durable, plays a hard, physical game and
still survives, and comes out of each game with the same demeanor
and intensity and kind of play that has given him a lot of credit
and a great career.''
</P>
<P>
   The even-keeled Green deferred praise but acknowledged he knows
how to play Malone after more than a decade of banging with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to match intensity for intensity. You have to be
ready for that with him,'' he said. ``You just try and force him
into areas he doesn't want to go. That's all you can really do with
Karl. You're not going to stop him.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing Green didn't do was score much, but Shaquille
O'Neal made that entirely irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   Busting through the defense of Olden Polynice and surviving a
third-quarter poke to the right eye from Greg Ostertag, O'Neal
punished the Jazz with 39 points, 18 rebounds, three blocked shots
and four assists in a 45-minute stint. And he continued to recover
at the foul line, hitting 11 of 20 free throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaq had a wonderful game,'' Jackson said. ``I think that's
probably one of the best games I've ever seen him play overall.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers never trailed through three quarters and led 68-56
heading into the fourth. But seven minutes and a few Bryon Russell
fast breaks later, the Jazz had whittled it down to a one-point
game, 71-70, the run capped by a John Stockton 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   Then Glen Rice, scoreless through the first two quarters, took
the initiative, scoring five straight en route to a 21-point second
half.
</P>
<P>
   After Rice missed a free throw, it was Green who saved the
possession with the rebound. Moments later, Green stole a Stockton
pass, leading to a pair of O'Neal free throws at the other end, and
a 10-point lead with 2:39 to go.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing the Lakers lacked was a breakout performance from
the bench. After three weeks of being carried almost solely by
O'Neal, Rice and Derek Fisher (14 points), Jackson hoped for better
support from the reserves Wednesday but didn't get it.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the Lakers only needed their starters, and a
defensive effort that ranked among their best this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz shot 37.5 percent and never led.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very good defensive team effort today,'' said Ron
Harper. ``Guys played team-help ball.''
</P>
<P>
   A lively Lakers defense and slow-to-a-crawl offense helped them
to a nine-point halftime lead, despite barely scratching the
scoreboard themselves. O'Neal scored 17 points as the Lakers took a
38-29 lead into the locker room.

<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  I'm thankful today that I don't stuff turkeys.
<P>
   I was once asked to perform that particular task, but my right
hand said to me, ``Don't go there, boyfriend.''
</P>
<P>
   I do plan to stuff myself today. What the hell, I dieted like
crazy one week last March so I could eat my way through this day
and right on through to the new millennium, when Y2K glitches on
bathroom scales will knock 20 pounds off everyone's weight. That's
what Nostradamus predicted before he died of gravy-clogged
arteries.

   I am older and wiser and I stuff myself more carefully now. One
Thanksgiving I ate until I exploded. I made a miraculous recovery,
but the dining room drapes had to be cremated and scattered at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Now I eat sensibly on Thanksgiving, stopping as soon as my chair
starts making creaking noises like a tree just before it topples.
</P>
<P>
   I'M THANKFUL Hillary finally made a decision. She's definitely
going to probably run, either for the Senate or for third-base
coach of the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary says she's going to cut way back on her White House
duties now, and that means that Bill will be stuffing his own
turkey and roasting his own chestnuts. Al Gore also said he's
cutting way back on  &UR; his  &LR; White House duties. Looks like Monica
started a trend.
</P>
<P>
   MY MISTAKES, I'm thankful for them, too. They not only keep me
humble, but I make just enough of them each day that I can fill the
next day's column with corrections, thus the column becomes a great
mandala, wheel of life.
</P>
<P>
   I wrote that people who fly all the way to Melbourne for the
next Olympics will be disappointed to learn that their tickets are
for the bridge competition.
</P>
<P>
   Brian McGuire says, ``Imagine how disappointed they'll be when
they get to Melbourne and find out the Olympics are in Sydney.''
</P>
<P>
   AND OF COURSE I'm thankful for the mistakes of others, which I
can pounce on with a self-righteous glee.
</P>
<P>
   I wrote about a woman who reads no English, presenting her
employer with a festive Christmas bag imprinted with ``Merry f_ing
Christmas!''
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Gonzalez says that in the Napa Valley last year, the
VINE buses were plastered with huge ads for a Mexican restaurant.
The ads wished everyone ``Feliz Navidad y prospero ano.''
</P>
<P>
   Ano means year, but in the ad there was no tilde (squiggly
little line) over the ``n,'' which changes the word's meaning. So
the bus ad translated to: ``Merry Christmas and prosperous butt.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is still a nice sentiment. I've got the ``Buns of Steel''
exercise video, so I can't wait for the financial advice video,
``Buns of Prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   WE CAN ALL be thankful that Tom Ammiano has injected a little
life into the mayoral race, which is taking on an Only-in-San
Francisco kind of feel.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Ammiano fund-raisers will be a comedy night called
``Tom- apalooza.'' Other Tom fund-raisers will feature
entertainment by a band called Dyke Dixieland and a Castro cowboy
called the Castro Cowboy.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, it's a shame that Willie Brown, maybe the foremost
legislative champion of gay rights ever, might take a beating,
vote-wise, in the gay community.
</P>
<P>
   These are confusing times for all of us, as I was saying just
this morning to my cross-dressing, bi-union, lesbian plumber, Earl.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the mayor can counter with ``Williepalooza,'' featuring
the musical stylings of the Boomtown Developers and the
Republicrats.
</P>
<P>
   Tom will get the transgender vote, Willie will get the
Transamerica vote.
</P>
<P>
   GIVE THANKS, if you're so inclined, that the remains of the
remains of Harvey Milk have found a place to rest. An item here
noted that some Milk memorabilia, and his ponytail and maybe a few
of his ashes, have been sitting in storage for years at a cemetery
in Washington, D.C. This sparked an offer from the S.F.
Columbarium.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Harvey's remaining remains will be placed in a
cenotaph (memorial other than a burial site) in a ceremony at the
Columbarium. I'm not sure if Milk's ponytail is part of the
package, but may the pieces of Harvey Milk rest in peace.
</P>
<P>
   RAIDER FANS can be thankful that snowball pelting is not a
capital offense in Denver. Raider Charles Woodson will be charged
with a misdemeanor for nailing a Broncos fan with a snowball. Which
is like arresting General Custer for brandishing a weapon in
public.
</P>
<P>
   HEY YOU, reading this: I'm thankful for you. Without you, I'd
have to go out and get a job, and you know how painful that can be.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a regular reader, there will be a little something for
you in my will. If you're reading this just to avoid talking to
your relatives, thank you for not skipping directly to Doonesbury
and Garfield.
</P>
<P>
   LEFTOVERS, yes, I'm thankful for them today. When you eat
yourself sick, the best cure for a food hangover is hair of the
turkey.

WILD TURKEYS HAVE REASON TO BE THANKFUL
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By KEVIN FAGAN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  Unlike the ultra-domesticated ranch bird on your Thanksgiving
plate, the wild turkey has a lot to be thankful for this year.
<P>
   For one thing, it's not dead. What's more, it probably won't
ever be anyone's meal.
</P>
<P>
   This is saying quite a mouthful, so to speak, considering that
the crafty critter that Benjamin Franklin wanted to name as the
national bird almost didn't make it anywhere close to the
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Hunted and otherwise displaced to the brink of extinction in the
United States just a few decades ago, the wild turkey is now being
declared a bona fide comeback success story. So much a success, in
fact, that it's also attaining that special status accorded to so
few species that have almost died out: lovable pest.
</P>
<P>
   But before we flap further, let's make one thing clear. That
aromatic lump of previously feathered meat on your holiday platter
bears no more resemblance to the wild turkey than a Porsche does to
a Dodge van.
</P>
<P>
   All those domestic turkeys strutting around poultry compounds
aren't exactly stupid, ranchers say, but dull-witted is probably a
kind description. They can't fly, and from hatching to hatchet,
they rarely think beyond the food trough. With their breasts bred
huge for maximum meat output, the males and females can't even get
the right body parts close enough together to mate without human
help.
</P>
<P>
   Not so the wily wild turkeys.
</P>
<P>
   They are ace fliers, ferocious lovers, and they cut a lean,
rakish figure in cream-and-tan feathers _ rakish by bird standards,
that is. These birds are so smart some hunters say they're harder
to track than grizzlies.
</P>
<P>
   They're virtually everywhere _ in San Francisco Bay Area
suburbs, hilly or flat, and, in fact, they can be found in 57 of
the state's 58 counties. They're also very gregarious, if you're
nice. Which, with the creatures being more plentiful than ever, has
become a mild problem.
</P>
<P>
   During last spring's mating season, swarms of love-crazed
turkeys hassled visitors at the Rancho San Antonio Preserve in
Santa Clara County, charging hikers and cars in a randy frenzy,
trying to make love to or fight with anything that moved. At homes
around Mount Diablo in Contra Costa County, flocks sometimes leave
so many droppings around decks and backyard birdie water tanks _
that's swimming pools to you and me _ that residents squawk to the
state fish and game rangers for help.
</P>
<P>
   Flocks of as many as 30 birds have been known to hold up traffic
outside Livermore and at California State University at Hayward,
and for a couple of months last winter dozens of them defiantly set
up shop on the campus soccer pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky they're so personable.
</P>
<P>
   Even when they are pesky, most folks say, the wild turkey is
still so entertaining that ``you just can't help but love it,''
said Joe Didonato, a wildlife specialist with the East Bay Regional
Park District.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are as tough as nails, very intelligent, very social
birds,'' said Didonato. ``They can live in anything from a desert
to a forest, and people might think all they do is make that
gobbling sound, but they actually have a full language all their
own. They're even fun to watch when they strut around and spread
their tail feathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're great birds.''
</P>
<P>
   That gulping gobble imitated this time of year by schoolkids
everywhere means various things, Didonato said _ but the turkey's
main communication comes in clucks and yelps. Wild turkeys have
calls for being lost, needing help, and all the other things
important to creatures worried about being eaten by other
creatures.
</P>
<P>
   They have plenty of reason to worry, too, because everything
that hunts _ foxes, eagles, snakes and the like _ thinks turkeys
taste as good as we think they do. Turkeys don't fight well, being
more suited to eating grasshoppers, grass and seeds, so the big
thing they do is fly and run.
</P>
<P>
   ``And boy, can they run,'' Didonato said. ``The average turkey
takes about 60,000 steps a day, and it can outrace just about
anything.'' At top trot, they hit 30 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Their wing power is impressive too: They flap to 30 mph without
breaking a sweat, and reach 80 mph in a power dive.
</P>
<P>
   The only disadvantage, if you can call it that, is that at an
average of 20 pounds, they are about 10 pounds lighter than their
domestic cousins. So there's less meat.
</P>
<P>
   The scrawniness didn't blunt Ben Franklin's enthusiasm back in
the 1700s, though. Not only did he appreciate the bird's
intelligence, beautiful bronze-and-white feathers, and tasty
usefulness, he noted how during its mating tizzy the turkey head
alternately turns red, white and blue.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble was, that same head is a wrinkled, ugly lump only a
turkey mom could love, compared with the more stately and
fierce-looking bald eagle. So the turkey lost out on the title, and
the rest is history _ including the heavy hunting of the turkey
that ensued over the next two centuries, and the logging of its
natural hardwood forest habitat, which led to the bird's nadir in
1930.
</P>
<P>
   By the Great Depression, there were only 30,000 wild turkeys
left in the United States, down from 2 million when the pilgrims
came in the early 1600s. Alarmed biologists and hunters undertook a
number of rescue attempts: A hunting excise tax was enacted in 1937
to raise cash to revive the turkey, and the campaign started to
catch hold in the late 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   From then, it was slow but steady progress until the mid-1990s,
when naturalists finally began to breathe easy. Today there are
more than 5 million wild turkeys in the United States, which is
still a far cry fewer than the 300 million domestic turkeys bred
each year _ but then the wild ones aren't destined for today's
forks. Because of the turkeys' sensitive status the severely
limited U.S. hunting season is only a few weeks in the spring and
fall.
</P>
<P>
   California's wild turkey, introduced as a nonnative bird in
1877, was nearly extinct in the 1970s. But by the 1990s it had come
back. The state now has about 150,000, roosting just about every
place where people aren't _ and even where they are.
</P>
<P>
   That's what gets them in trouble. Wild turkeys, which never
migrate, are prevalent all year in Bay Area hilly spots such as
Sunol, Mount Diablo and in Del Valle Regional Park outside
Livermore. And in true California fashion, where there are hills
there are houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem is when people get too friendly,'' said
Scott Gardner, a state Department of Fish and Game biologist
specializing in wild turkeys. ``People like to see them run around
and hear them gobble, so they feed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``And once you do that, they're like stray cats. You can't get
rid of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Hence the trouble on the east side of Danville near Mount Diablo
a few years ago when the mayor got so worked up by turkey droppings
and early-morning cacklings around his house that he asked the
state to get rid of the local flocks. No way, the state animal and
bird cops said _ and that was just fine with a lot of the
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're still here, squawking and gobbling every day in our
back yard, and we love it,'' said Danville resident Jack Cohen.
``They wake us up every morning and my wife and I just look at each
other and smile.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen and his neighbor, Richard Warrington, said a 30-bird flock
has been pecking around the block for years. They sleep in the oak
trees at night and trot through the open spaces and backyards by
day to dine on weeds, bugs and berries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find them totally entertaining,'' said Cohen. `They're truly
beautiful birds.''
</P>
<P>
   Didonato of the park district finds them to be more than that.
He finds them mighty tasty, too.
</P>
<P>
   Didonato's job is to make sure the sprawling park district's
several hundred wandering wild turkeys are safe and unmolested, and
he personally knows every roost. But once a year he allows himself
a closer relationship to the species _ in a dinner sort of way.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, he went up to a friend's private land near Clear
Lake, startled a flock into fleeing in front of his 12-gauge
shotgun barrel, and voila: He had his Thanksgiving meal, feathers
and all.
</P>
<P>
   It was no easy feat. Wild turkeys have peripheral vision of
about 240 degrees, and even the eyeblink of an otherwise motionless
hunter can send them wheeling away. It took two days of heavy
slogging through the weeds before Didonato bagged his 12-pound hen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was worth every minute,'' Didonato said with a happy sigh.
``It's going to be very tasty.''

`FRANKENFOODS' IS ONE SUMMIT MENU ITEM LIKELY TO LEAVE BAD TASTE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  On the table when the World Trade Organization meets in Seattle
next week will be an issue that affects the taste buds, checkbooks
and perhaps the health of American grocery shoppers _ the export of
genetically engineered foods.
<P>
   The trade summit will give many Americans their first exposure
to a controversy that has raged in Europe, where stories about
``Frankenfoods'' suggest that genetically altered soybeans, corn
and other crops pose unknown dangers to animals, humans and the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   So far, most American consumers seem unconcerned _ or at least
uninformed _ that the corn syrup in Coke and the flakes in their
Kellogg's carton probably contain corn that was genetically
modified to kill bugs that eat the plant. The U.S. government says
consumers are right to be indifferent, contending that modified
corn is no different than &LR; from standard varieties.
</P>
<P>
   But opposition to the technology is growing in this country,
especially among organic foods advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Waters, owner of Berkeley's Chez Panisse restaurant and a
leader of the natural foods movement, said: ``We are way behind the
Europeans on this. This is even more frightening than pesticides.
We're really upsetting the web of life when we make genetic
alterations.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry advocates flocking to the WTO meeting call such
concerns irrational and say the genetic enhancements do nothing
more than improve resistance to pests and disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a shred of evidence these products are unsafe;
quite to the contrary, they have benefits to farmers and
consumers,'' said Val Giddings, vice president for the
Biotechnology Industry Organization in Washington. ``Issues of food
safety are only likely to come up in terms of propaganda by
critics.''
</P>
<P>
   But the foes of genetically engineered foods have the industry
on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   Their movement already has resulted in European importers
rejecting $400 million worth of U.S. feed corn, on the grounds that
the corn could not be certified as being free of genetic
modifications. And proposed new food labeling rules in Europe could
prevent U.S. farmers and processed-food makers from exporting other
products if they contain even trace amounts of genetically altered
material.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. negotiators will head to Seattle badly isolated. In Japan,
consumers are afraid their tofu might contain genetically modified
soybeans. Many Canadians also are demanding that foods be labeled
if they contain what the Europeans call genetically modified
organisms (GMOs).
</P>
<P>
   Canada and Japan will lead an international effort to force the
WTO to discuss, and perhaps amend, current trade rules _ favored by
the United States _ that require that all objections to genetically
modified foods be based solely on ``scientific'' grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can only come out worse (from such a discussion) than we
went in,'' a senior U.S. official complained.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington _ which is hoping that the status quo will
prevail _ is in a bind. If the trade ministers depart Seattle
without addressing the controversy, their inaction could revive a
competing international negotiation, the Biosafety Protocol. And
that would be even more unfriendly to exports of bioengineered
foods.
</P>
<P>
   An outgrowth of the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, the
Biosafety Protocol has brought together environmental ministers
from every U.N. member state. At their February meeting in
Cartagena, Colombia, the ministers nearly enacted rules that would
have allowed nations to exclude genetically modified foods on the
grounds that such high-tech crops might undermine local
agricultural practices.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and a handful of other grain exporting nations
managed to block that move. Now GMO &LR; opponents aim to make the
pro-trade WTO deadlock on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If nothing happens in Seattle, that would be very
significant,'' said Kristin Dawkins, a genetically modified foods
opponent with the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy in
Minneapolis. ``It would confirm that the Biosafety Protocol is the
proper forum for these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. negotiating strategy in Seattle seems aimed at engaging
other nations in a discussion that would take no action to change
current international trade rules, while working behind the scenes
to persuade Europe and Japan and other countries to dismantle their
regulatory roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We start with the analysis that the Europeans are our primary
challenge,'' said a senior U.S. official.
</P>
<P>
   Some European officials say privately that the reaction to
bioengineered foods on their shores has gotten out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opposition is being sustained and encouraged by various
parties within and outside governments for reasons of protectionism
and institutional self-interest which have little to do with the
alleged risks to consumers or the environment,'' groused one senior
official with the European Commission.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials contend that Europeans, alarmed by mad cow
disease and other food mishaps having nothing to do with genetic
engineering, have demonized food technology. European demands that
processed foods be labeled if they contain 1 percent of
GMO &LR; bioengineered ingredients could nip biotech agriculture in the
bud, those officials fear.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, the only direct effect on U.S. exports has been the
loss of the feed-corn sales.
</P>
<P>
   A third of the U.S. corn crop, and half of all American
soybeans, are planted with genetically altered seeds, making for a
huge potential impact in the Midwest, where such crops are grown.
</P>
<P>
   Soybean producers are worried about labeling. Soybean extracts
go into many processed foods, and consumers in many nations might
shun any food labeled as genetically modified.
</P>
<P>
   So far, California, the nation's largest food producer and
exporter, has remained above the fray. Louis Brown, trade expert
for the California Farm Bureau, said California crops such as
fruits and nuts are not yet genetically engineered. Cotton, the one
California export that is genetically modified, isn't a food.
</P>
<P>
   ``California farmers can afford to wait and see,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, public concern has begun to grow, and the Food and
Drug Administration has begun a series of public hearings on the
safety of bioengineered foods. Legislation calling for labeling of
genetically engineered foods has been introduced in the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   For opponents like Michael Hansen, a researcher with Consumer
Policy Institute, a division of Consumers Union, the public
re-examination of U.S. policy toward this technology is overdue.
Hansen thinks the FDA erred in 1992, when it decided that
genetically altered crops are no different from varieties created
through traditional plant breeding techniques.
</P>
<P>
   That decision, which is being challenged in federal court, gave
bioengineered crops the benefit of the doubt, presuming them safe
unless shown otherwise, thus putting the burden of proof on
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no hard evidence now that the foods out on the market
will be harmful,'' Hansen said. ``But that's because there hasn't
been adequate safety testing done.''
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, it may be that consumer preference, whether
science-based or fanciful, may have more effect on genetically
engineered foods than all the world's trade ministers and
protesters combined.
</P>
<P>
   As the California Farm Bureau's Brown put it: ``This is a
totally market-driven concept. Farmers can't afford to plant such
crops if consumers won't buy them.''

WTO DEAL WITH CHINA MAY CUT INTO PIRACY, SMUGGLING
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  From Silicon Valley to Hollywood, California businesses have
much to gain from China's planned entry into the World Trade
Organization.
<P>
   They certainly have little left to lose.
</P>
<P>
   The state's high-tech and entertainment industries already are
deprived of many millions of dollars in China each year because of
piracy, smuggling and red tape. It's now hoped that the trade deal
signed last week by Washington and Beijing will create a more level
playing field.
</P>
<P>
   However, no one expects changes to come overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a huge, huge challenge,'' said Anne Craib,
director of international trade for the Semiconductor Industry
Association. ``Anyone who thinks everything has been solved has
never been to China.''
</P>
<P>
   By that, she means Chinese authorities have a track record of
promising the moon and delivering little more than green cheese.
Case in point: The Clinton administration reached an agreement with
Beijing in 1995 for protection of intellectual property rights. But
aside from a handful of highly publicized closures of pirate CD
factories, little came of the pact. Most pirates simply changed
locations and stepped up production.
</P>
<P>
   The Recording Industry Association of America estimates that at
least 90 percent of the CDs sold in mainland China are pirated
versions, costing U.S. music companies approximately $80 million in
annual losses.
</P>
<P>
   The rip-off of the U.S. film industry is even greater. The
Motion Picture Association estimates that pirated versions of
American films cost Hollywood about $120 million a year in lost
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Mulan,' the Disney picture, bombed at the box office in
China because the tapes were available on the street before the
film hit theaters,'' observed Jack Valenti, the association's
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The software industry, meanwhile, says no fewer than 95 percent
of applications on Chinese computers are pirated _ a figure
surpassed only by Vietnam's 98 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Piracy is a real steep mountain to climb,'' said Mario Correa,
trade policy manager for the Business Software Alliance, which
includes Bay Area firms such as Autodesk and Adobe Systems. ``But
you have to start somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   China's new pact with the United States is seen as just such a
start.
</P>
<P>
   The accord will cut tariffs on industrial and agricultural
goods, and allow easier market access for U.S. financial
institutions, insurers and telecommunications firms.
</P>
<P>
   And it brings China a big step closer to its long-held goal of
joining the WTO, which sets the rules for global commerce and
mediates disputes among its 135 member countries.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing now needs to cut similar deals with the European Union,
Canada and other nations. At the same time, the U.S. Congress must
grant China permanent ``normal trade relations'' status, which
won't come easily, given next year's election and the media's focus
on Chinese political repression.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the AFL-CIO and other labor groups have sworn to fight
China's entry into the WTO, and the textile industry has said it
will lobby hard on Capitol Hill to protect safeguards for its
products.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the tech business will push for Congress to give
its blessing to the U.S.-China pact and to China's WTO accession.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be one of the biggest lobbying efforts in recent
history,'' said Dave McCurdy, president of the Electronic
Industries Alliance, a confederation of tech and telecom groups.
``We're organizing like never before.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The public and members of Congress will have to be educated on
this,'' said Jennifer Guhl, director of international trade policy
for the American Electronics Association, which represents about
3,000 high-tech corporations.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to understand why the tech industry is pushing so
hard.
</P>
<P>
   China's tech market is only about one-tenth the size of
America's. But sales of personal computers on the mainland are
expected to double over the next five years, and are projected to
equal American PC sales by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   By the same year, China is likely to have the world's
second-largest semiconductor market, after the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's accord covered just about everything on the tech
industry's wish list. For example, U.S. companies in China now will
be able to import and distribute their own goods, rather than being
forced to use state-run firms as intermediaries.
</P>
<P>
   An important condition laid down by Washington was for China to
become a signatory of the Information Technology Agreement, a
separate treaty that calls for most tariffs on tech products to be
eliminated by 2000. The agreement affects $500 billion in annual
global technology trade, including as much as $100 billion in U.S.
exports.
</P>
<P>
   For companies such as Santa Clara chipmaker Intel Corp. and San
Jose's Cisco Systems, such changes will vastly improve efficiency
and profitability in their dealings with mainland China.
</P>
<P>
   But China retreated from an earlier pledge to allow U.S.
companies to hold 51 percent stakes in mainland telecommunications
ventures. Instead, Beijing drew the line at 50 percent ownership,
thus barring foreign firms from holding a majority position.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes perhaps the hardest part: getting China to comply with
the terms of the deal. Many in the business community hope that the
carrot of WTO membership will compel the Chinese to abide by
international conventions regarding patents and copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will make a huge difference when multilateral pressure is
brought to bear on China,'' said the American Electronics
Association's Guhl. ``It will hold China to its commitments.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., a persistent critic of the
Beijing regime, is highly dubious about Chinese compliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you give China permanent normal trade relations status,
there's no turning back,'' she said. ``We're relinquishing our
leverage. Once they're in (the WTO), and if they don't comply, we
can file a complaint. ... And then what? Nothing. And then
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Craib and other industry leaders agree that WTO membership would
not be a quick fix for the various obstacles faced by foreign
companies in China. For example, Craib estimated that 80 percent of
microchips in the country are smuggled in illegally by parties
seeking to avoid taxes and tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of how systemic such problems have become, it has been
widely reported that the powerful Chinese military is one of the
leading purveyors of smuggled goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``WTO is not a magic wand that's going to eliminate these
problems overnight,'' Craib said. ``But it would be worse to just
let things go and not do anything at all.''
</P>
<P>
   While the concessions China has made will help Congress feel
more comfortable conferring normal trade relations status, it won't
be easy for the trade deal's backers to overcome opponents'
objections to China's human- and labor-rights policies and the
well-entrenched interests of the textile industry.
</P>
<P>
   AFL-CIO President John Sweeney, a fierce critic of the
U.S.-China pact, vowed last week to muster thousands of union
members and environmentalists for a huge march in Seattle on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will call upon the (WTO delegates) to address workers'
rights and human rights as well as environmental and consumer
protections in the rules that govern the global economy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi had harsh words for Clinton, saying: ``The president
wants to redeem his failed China policy, which hasn't accomplished
anything. It's this big cosmetic thing, but he won't have to deal
with the ramifications because he'll be out of office by then.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``If there's ever an argument for campaign finance
reform, if there's ever a gravy train, it's the corporate lobby for
China.''
</P>
<P>
   The Electronic Industries Alliance's McCurdy acknowledged that
struggle lies ahead: ``Just because we have an agreement doesn't
mean it's all done.''

surrounding President Tudjman. By Stephen Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-SHOE-FASHION (Tokyo) _ The height of fashion _ shoes with
eight-inch soles or six-inch heels _ is taking a toll on young
Japanese women. By Calvin Sims.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  (``w'' code)
</P>
<P>
   BUSINESS-CONGRESS (Washington) _ Democrats call it a do-nothing
Congress; Republicans are only slightly more enthusiastic, saying
it was all that could be expected with such narrow majorities in
the House and Senate and a Democratic president. But business
lobbies like the Chamber of Commerce think they had a great year in
Congress. Not only did they get most of what they wanted, but they
were able to block the things they did not want. By David E.
Rosenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL GENERAL &LR;  (``a'' code)
</P>
<P>
   PHILLY-HOMELESS (Philadelphia) _ Inside the Back Home Cafe,

<P>
   &UR; POLITICS &LR;  (``p'' code)
</P>
<P>
   GORE-MRSCLINTON (Washington) _ The parallel paths of Hillary
Clinton and Al Gore, who each have held on to their day jobs and
White House offices, but who each have moved (to Chappaqua, to
Nashville) almost full-time into their lives as candidates. A
Political Memo by Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SCIENCE &LR;  (``a'' code)

   ASTRO-MICROWAVES (Undated) _ Like the great navigators who first
sailed around the world, establishing its size and the curvature of
its surface, astronomers have made new observations that show with

consensus among government, labor and management. By Edmund L.

   NORRIS-COLUMN (Undated) _ Shopping is something that, for better
and for worse, Americans have done a lot of in recent years. This
week's economic report showed that the economy grew a healthy 4.2
percent, year-over-year, through the third quarter. But that
headline figure severely understates just how fast our purchases
are increasing. Real sales to domestic purchasers were up 5.6
percent. The difference is largely a surge in imports, funded by
borrowing. But while change is not imminent, it is coming. ``It
is,'' says Robert Barbera, the chief economist of Hoenig &AMP; Co.,
``extremely hard to believe that we can spend at a growth rate of
5.6 percent in perpetuity.'' By Floyd Norris.
</P>
<P>
   SODAS-CITIES (Huntington Beach, Calif.) _ Nearly a dozen cities
across the nation have in the last year signed contracts with
Coca-Cola or Pepsi giving the soft-drink company exclusive rights
to sales on city property. Such sponsorship deals are increasingly
coming under attack from consumer advocates. By Verne G. Kopytoff.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-LOANS (Tokyo) _ Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's Tokyo office
on Thursday sold the first set of securities linked to
non-performing Japanese real-estate loans, paving the way for what
may be a flood of deals aimed at redressing a big portion of the
excessive lending that all but bankrupted the Japanese financial
system. By Stephanie Strom.

   Weekend Section stories from The New York Times News Service for
Friday, Nov. 26.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FEATURES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   APPLES-CHARLESTON (Charleston, S.C.) _ You can't say it about
many cities, but you can say it about this one: One man changed its
destiny. His name is Joseph P. Riley Jr. He is Charleston's mayor.
He halted its long decline, which lasted for a hundred years after
the Civil War, turning it from a proud but rotting relic into a
model modern city. Riley has had help, of course: from a business
community galvanized into action when the 95-year-old Charleston
Naval Base was closed in 1996; from a devoted band of
preservationists determined to restore the beauties of antebellum
Charleston; from an unconventional police chief, Reuben Greenberg,
a black Jew with two degrees from Berkeley whose Deep South brand
of tough love has slashed the crime rate and forged better race
relations; and from Gian Carlo Menotti, who rejuvenated the city's
cultural life when he established an American version of his
Spoleto festival here. The mayor has also been helped a lot by
history. Charleston is steeped in it, and tourists flock here to
trace its footprints in the jasmine-scented streets and
aristocratic houses. By R.W. Apple Jr.
</P>
<P>
   VELAZQUEZ-EXHIBIT (New York) _ On the principle that there are
no small shows, only small artists, the six paintings brought
together for ``Velazquez in New York Museums'' at the Frick
Collection add up a very big show indeed. By Holland Cotter.
</P>
<P>
   OFF-BROADWAY (New York) _ Acting awards may be self-indulgent
and ever so tacky. But as long as we're stuck with them, why
shouldn't there be a high-powered set of them for Off Broadway?
Within the theater industry, the Obies, administered by The Village
Voice, have considerable prestige, and the Drama Desks, parceled
out to actors and productions on Broadway and off, certainly merit
mention in Playbill bios. Yet no one has devised the widely
recognizable acting prizes that Off Broadway has so abundantly
earned. I raise the issue (and not for the first time) not so much
to encourage the further glitzing of New York's serious theater as
to point out that when one has a hankering for great performances,
more often than not the first places to look for satisfaction these
days are the city's smaller stages. A critic's notebook by Peter
Marks.

SUMMING UP JOHN ADAMS AT MIDCAREER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 28) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (af)  
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When John Adams cruised onto listeners' radar screens in 1980,
with his ``Shaker Loops'' and ``Phrygian Gates'' (both composed in
1977), on an LP from the small, now defunct label 1750 Arch, three
things were immediately apparent.
</P>
<P>
   One was that the Minimalist school, pioneered a decade earlier
by Philip Glass, Steve Reich and Terry Riley, would have legs.
Adams, who is now 52, was a decade younger than the founders of the
style, and he came to it from an unlikely direction.
</P>
<P>
   He studied at Harvard with Leon Kirchner, whose emotional,
rigorously structured works were a world apart from Minimalist
abstractions and simplicities, and in 1971 he moved to San
Francisco, a continent away from Minimalism's home ground. Not that
others hadn't picked up on the style and its growing popularity;
but no one had crashed the Minimalist party with the energizing
freshness heard in Adams' early works.
</P>
<P>
   That originality was the second ear-catching aspect of his
music. Perhaps it should not have been surprising that a newcomer
to Minimalism could quickly develop a distinctive voice. The early
practitioners, though dealing in music that both supporters and
detractors described as stripped down, had established unmistakable
personal styles.
</P>
<P>
   Yet most newcomers seemed like apprentices either to Glass,
whose early fascination with additive process was then giving way
to an interest in drama, or to Reich, who was focused on the
intricacies of interlocking rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   Adams brought something new to the Minimalism of the time:
chromaticism and gesture, both varied to create an expressive
effect. ``Phrygian Gates,'' which makes its way around the harmonic
circle of fifths, touching on every key, and ``Shaker Loops,''
which made peace with the Romanticism that Minimalism had until
then rejected, came as a jolt to listeners who thought they knew
what Minimalism was about.
</P>
<P>
   And the third thing made apparent by that first recording was
that unless those works were flukes, Adams would bear watching. Two
decades later, he has been duly watched and commented on, both
admiringly and harshly, as he has followed paths his early
listeners could not have predicted.
</P>
<P>
   A current of sometimes schoolboyish humor quickly became an
important part of his palette, and he has shown an uncanny ability
to assimilate other compositional styles and twist them into
something recognizably his own, just as he did with Minimalism.
While he is too young to be considered venerable, he has become an
established presence on the American compositional landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a busy presence at the moment. Nonesuch, the record
label with which he has developed a personal affiliation (although
others record his music) has just issued a 10-CD retrospective,
``The John Adams Earbox,'' which invites even listeners who know
his work to hear it afresh in a careerwide context. And Robert
Spano and the Brooklyn Philharmonic are presenting a concert
version of the better of his two operas, ``Nixon in China,'' on
Friday and Saturday at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, still a Californian, will be in New York on those
evenings but otherwise engaged, conducting the New York
Philharmonic in a Copland program at Avery Fisher Hall.
</P>
<P>
   It is tempting, given this confluence, to wonder whether Adams
might have been a kind of Copland for the '90s. The equation
doesn't ultimately work; the composers, the times and the
constitution of the American musical world now and in Copland's
heyday are too different. Still, there are peculiar parallels.
</P>
<P>
   Each composer worked in a formal, academically approved style
before discovering the popular language that helped him make a
splash. What Minimalism did for Adams, the Stravinsky ballets based
on Russian folk sources did for the young Copland, becoming a
template for the ``prairie'' style that made him famous. Each
composer grew stylistically restless once he had established
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Copland explored Neo-Classicism and serialism, but he remained a
neo-Romantic at heart, revisiting his folksier style, if only in
passing. The recordings in the ``Earbox'' (Nonesuch 79453-2),
selected by Adams and in many cases conducted by him, chronicle the
array of styles on which he has touched, including the almost
Ligetian density of the first movement of ``Harmonium'' (1981) and
the decidedly non-Minimalist angularity of the Violin Concerto
(1993).
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, Adams seems not to have shared Copland's
fascination with Middle Americana, beyond the un-Coplandesque
``Hoedown'' in ``Gnarly Buttons'' (1996) and the quirky country
fiddling movement in ``John's Book of Alleged Dances'' (1994). Yet
the broad, open string chords of his ``Christian Zeal and
Activity'' (1973), the earliest work in the ``Earbox,'' are a
deconstructed hymn, and they bear a striking resemblance to the
devotional orchestral fabric of Copland's ``Lincoln Portrait,''
though the tape component of the Adams work, an electronically
manipulated snippet from a radio sermon, takes its lineage from
Reich's ``It's Gonna Rain.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Adjust for the difference in eras, and the composers' populist
connection becomes even more apparent. Where Copland used hymns and
folk melodies to create his aural image of America, Adams, a child
of the 1950s and '60s, draws on pop music in all its variety. Rock
references abound, as in the brawny riffs of ``Lollapalooza''
(1995), and Adams flirts with theatrical pop in ``I Was Looking at
the Ceiling and Then I Saw the Sky'' (1995), jazz in ``Eros Piano''
(1989) and New Age in ``Hoodoo Zephyr'' (1992).
</P>
<P>
   He touches on earlier pop music in ``The Chairman Dances''
(1985), an eccentric fox trot with a hint of Gershwin. And he
alludes to world music, with a Middle Eastern accent, in ``John's
Book of Alleged Dances,'' a wide-ranging compendium for string
quartet; in Copland, the parallel would be works like ``El Salon
Mexico.'' What links Adams to Copland in the end is that both are
essentially neo-Romantics, with a taste for music that moves
people, whether popular or more formal.
</P>
<P>
   But there the comparisons must end. Since Adams is relatively
young and evidently not lacking in inspiration, it would be
pointless to speculate about his eventual stature; now that
American music has its place in the international repertory, there
is no need for a towering figure in the Copland mold.
</P>
<P>
   Still, although Copland had the kind of relationship with CBS
Masterworks (now Sony Classical) that Adams has with Nonesuch, he
did not live to see his composer-directed discography compiled in a
comprehensive boxed overview. Indeed, Sony has yet to treat his
legacy seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The Adams compilation paints an expansive portrait. Its details
are already familiar to collectors who have kept pace with the
composer, for only three previously unissued recordings are
included. They account for a mere 52 minutes, and one of the
pieces, the 31-minute ``Harmonium,'' is a known commodity, having
long been available in recordings conducted by Edo de Waart (ECM)
and Robert Shaw (Telarc); here Adams leads the Orchestra of St.
Luke's. The other two pieces are new to disc, and one of them,
``Slonimsky's Earbox'' (1996), gives the set its title.
</P>
<P>
   On glancing acquaintance, both this frenetic, thick-textured
work, with its turn-of-the-(last-)century Russian accent, and the
other newcomer, ``Lollapalooza,'' sound like patches of orchestral
bombast, curtain raisers that demonstrate Adams' facility as a
colorist. Composers have done worse with similarly limited aims,
but there is more to these works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slonimsky's Earbox,'' a memorial to the musical lexicographer
Nicolas Slonimsky, is full of involving counterpoint, juxtaposing
interesting modal themes, and it continues Adams' longstanding
project of combining Minimalist techniques with complex structures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The John Adams Earbox'' offers the misses as well as the hits,
but one of its surprises is that over time, some of the composer's
works have either gained or lost weight. Figuratively, for the most
part, although ``Shaker Loops,'' written as a chamber piece, is
heard here in the orchestration Adams considers its finished form.
</P>
<P>
   The orchestration magnifies the music's incipient Romanticism,
but there is much to be said for the sparer septet version heard on
that old 1750 Arch recording in a performance featuring the Ridge
Quartet (now on a New Albion CD with ``Light Over Water,'' an
appealing work for synthesizers and brass, otherwise unavailable).
</P>
<P>
   ``Hoodoo Zephyr,'' a collection of synthesizer pieces, seemed
little more than fluffy doodling when it was first released, in
1993. Adams, with the wisdom of hindsight, may concur (although a
defensive program note suggests otherwise); he includes only three
of the seven original selections here. In the context of this
anthology, they seem more consistent with Adams' output and more
listenable overall.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps insufficient time has elapsed to help ``I Was Looking at
the Ceiling and Then I Saw the Sky,'' his theatrical collaboration
with June Jordan; more likely, trying to harness the insufferable
cliches of the moribund musical theater style was simply a dreadful
idea. The work was meant to be current and topical, a snapshot of
Los Angeles at the time of the Northridge earthquake in 1994, with
characters of various ethnicities.
</P>
<P>
   It has its moments; the song ``Crushed by the Rock I Been
Standing On'' stands out. But the characters are generally
one-dimensional, and they engage in predictable posturing. Although
the instrumental accompaniments show glimmers of Adams' style, the
vocal lines could be taken as parodies of the Broadway cadence if
they were not so earnest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nixon in China'' (1987) and ``The Death of Klinghoffer''
(1991), immensely superior works musically, are represented by
excerpts, one disc each. ``Klinghoffer'' has always caused
uneasiness. Adams and his librettist, Alice Goodman, may have meant
to empathize with both Jews and Palestinians, but they left hardly
anyone satisfied and many aggrieved (not least, the family of Leon
Klinghoffer, whose murder by Palestinian terrorists on the hijacked
cruise ship Achille Lauro is the opera's central event).
</P>
<P>
   ``Nixon'' fared better in its time; it is, after all, a fantasy
on a diplomatic breakthrough. Yet it left furrowed brows as well,
and not without reason.
</P>
<P>
   What proved most interesting about ``Nixon in China'' was the
contrast between the buffoonish character of Nixon, whose arias
portray either megalomania (the fabulously parodistic ``News Has a
Kind of Mystery'') or self-absorbed triviality, and the more
serenely philosophical Mao and Chou En-lai. In terms of the
contrast between cultures, it still works. In fact, both operas
work if you can divorce them from the actual events they portray
and regard their characters not as real people but as archetypes
embodying grander human qualities and foibles.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But such a conceptual leap may be too much to ask. The
characters are real people, and the events occurred in living
memory. The tensions plumbed in ``Klinghoffer'' remain open wounds
on both sides. And while the philosophical disparities between East
and West, ancient and modern, are intriguingly explored in
``Nixon,'' the fact that Mao and his circle were bona fide tyrants,
carrying out the oppressive Cultural Revolution at the time of
Nixon's visit, makes it unseemly to present them as philosopher
kings.
</P>
<P>
   If these are missteps _ and there is room for debate _ they seem
to have been taken honestly, in the belief that operas based on
contemporary events would have greater immediacy than fiction, and
that if the characters worked as archetypes (as they eventually
may), the works would have a long shelf life. There is, in any
case, superb music and imaginative text setting in these operas,
and they form an important part of the evolution the ``Earbox''
traces.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, however, it is in the works not intended for the
stage that the composer's more characteristic innovation really
shines. And listening to those works, one is struck by the sheer
variety of what Adams has produced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grand Pianola Music'' (1982), with its rippling keyboard
roulades and big orchestral gestures, pokes fun at the heroics of
Romantic concerto writing. ``Fearful Symmetries'' (1988) toys
similarly with symphonic textures, and the Chamber Symphony (1992)
takes yet another tack, offsetting a Neo-Classicism rooted in
Stravinsky and Schoenberg with bursts of cartoonish humor. These
pieces aren't brain surgery; they insist that symphonic music can
be slyly funny, and fun.
</P>
<P>
   Adams has a contrastingly sober side, evident in ``The Wound
Dresser'' (1989), an eerily vivid _ and entirely non-Minimalist _
setting of Walt Whitman's wrenching battlefield poetry. The Violin
Concerto, searingly played by Gidon Kremer, is as substantial an
addition to that corner of the repertory as any composer has made
in the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eros Piano'' extends Adams' language in a different way.
Written after an evening with Toru Takemitsu, it embraces the
atmospheric gracefulness of that composer's later style through
inventive string voicings, and its solo piano line hints at the
shapely improvisations of Bill Evans, to whom the work is in fact a
tribute. ``Harmonium'' and ``Harmonielehre'' (1985), Adams' big
treatises on harmony, orchestration and color, become more
compelling with each hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Nonesuch has packaged the ``Earbox'' handsomely, in a slipcase
that holds the 10 thin jewel boxes and a generously illustrated
180-page booklet. The notes include a work-by-work rumination by
Adams and appreciations by Robert Hurwitz, the president of
Nonesuch, and Renaud Machart, a French critic, who provides a
European perspective on Adams. Shorter encomiums (by Michael Tilson
Thomas, Peter Sellars, Kremer, Sir Simon Rattle and others) are
scattered throughout the booklet, which also offers vocal texts, a
chronology and a discography.
</P>
<P>
   There are holes in the set, but very few. ``Phrygian Gates,'' a
piano work pivotal in Adams' canon, is not included, but it is
available in several fine accounts. Among them are discs by
Christopher O'Riley (Albany) and Gloria Cheng-Cochran (Telarc),
both of which also include ``China Gates,'' a rarer work also
absent from the ``Earbox.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1973 triptych ``American Standard,'' represented in part by
``Christian Zeal and Activity,'' would have been welcome in its
entirety. And although the ``Earbox'' renders most of Adams'
individual Nonesuch releases superflous, completists will have to
keep ``Hoodoo Zephyr'' for its four missing pieces, and ``El
Dorado'' for Adams' Liszt and Busoni orchestrations as well as the
complete recordings of ``Nixon'' and ``Klinghoffer.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Earbox'' is, of course, hardly the double bar on Adams'
career. Perhaps when ``The John Adams Earbox II'' is released in 20
years or so, these gaps will be filled.

`FLU': MEDICAL SLEUTHS STALK ONE OF HISTORY'S GREAT KILLERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Alaska, S.C.)   (Eds, publication notes at end)  
(DW) 
 By HELEN FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In September 1918 a mass murderer was on the loose. Europeans,
Americans, Asians, Africans, Eskimos, Polynesians, men and women
from the Arctic to Australia died in hours from this killer. In
Ottawa streetcars were largely empty, theaters and movie houses
were dark. In Reading, England, schools turned into hospitals, and
morgues. In Cape Town coffins became so scarce that many of the
dead were buried in mass graves. More Americans died by this mighty
hand than were killed in all the battles of World War I, World War
II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War: half a million in all.
</P>
<P>
   In the corridors of some city morgues in the United States,
bodies were stacked four feet deep. American baseball players and
their fans wore gauze masks. They feared the 1918 influenza, which
came to be known as the Spanish flu. Its cause: a mystery. Its
cure: none. Doctors recommended food, fresh air and tender loving
care. They had no treatment, and no vaccine. Some 20 percent of
victims recovered without incident; many more died within days.
</P>
<P>
   The virologist John Oxford has called it ``the biggest outbreak
of any infectious disease ever known, bigger than the Black
Death.'' Epidemiologists have estimated that 20 million to 100
million people died worldwide. Then the pestilence vanished as
mysteriously as it had appeared. In ``Flu,'' Gina Kolata, a science
reporter for The New York Times, writes of this 1918 pandemic with
verve, clarity and nightmarish detail.
</P>
<P>
   The symptoms, for example, were not pretty: a dull headache,
burning eyes, chills, fevers, coughing up blood, shortness of
breath and death as the lungs deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Ms. Kolata's book concerns the scientists who have
searched to find and identify the 1918 influenza virus in hopes of
preventing its horror from revisiting humankind. It is a
fascinating tale.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out the major clues were found in the remains of two
U.S. Army privates and an Eskimo woman. Pvt. Roscoe Vaughan was a
strapping 21-year-old who checked into Camp Jackson near Columbia,
S.C., in 1918 and fell sick on Sept. 19. A week later he died.
Subsequently a small slice of his lung tissue was saturated with
formaldehyde, sunk in a chunk of candle wax smaller than a penny
and sent to the archives at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   As Vaughan lay dying, Pvt. James Downs got chills at Camp Upton,
N.Y. On Sept. 26 he succumbed, too. A snippet of his diseased lung
was sent to the same archive.
</P>
<P>
   Then in mid-November an obese young Eskimo woman left her igloo
in a tiny settlement on the Seward Peninsula of Alaska to join a
village feast of reindeer meat, hot cakes and blueberries soaked in
seal oil. She was welcoming two visitors who had come 90 miles by
dog sled from Nome. Then she, too, suddenly began to shudder with
fever. Within days her body was placed along with the other
infected corpses in a trench in the permafrost. The freezing
temperature and her body fat preserved much of her remains,
including traces of the dead virus.
</P>
<P>
   These three victims would provide a biological ``Rosetta stone''
for this macabre illness, and those who sought to decipher its
clues are interesting characters themselves.
</P>
<P>
   One is the retired pathologist Johan V. Hultin, who exhumed the
Eskimo woman's corpse, recovering bits of the virus. Another is the
dogged virologist Jeffery Taubenberger, who rummaged among the
millions of body parts stored in the Armed Forces archive, found
the remains of Privates Vaughan and Downs, and gradually pieced
together much of the genetic structure of this killer virus.
</P>
<P>
   The stories of the men and women who struggled to find the
virus, make their reputations, assuage their curiosity and possibly
save the world from another disaster are compelling.
</P>
<P>
   But I found some of the still-unsolved questions about this
epidemic to be even more intriguing. For example, no one knows why
this virus had such unprecedented virulence. The answer may lie in
an earlier epidemic: the 1890 flu. As one theory goes, people who
caught the 1890 flu produced copious quantities of antibodies and
then, if the 1918 flu virus had a similar protein on its surface,
the antibodies to the 1890 flu might well have turned to fight it,
perhaps too strenuously.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Kolata puts it: ``In a gross overresponse to the 1918
virus, armies of white blood cells and fluids could rush to the
lungs of flu patients. The healthier people were, and the better
their immune systems, the more likely they would be to die when
they were infected with the 1918 virus.'' She adds that the only
way to confirm this theory is to find the 1890 flu virus, in the
same Armed Forces archive.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Kolata spins out this remarkable scientific detective
story, the reader comes to understand a good deal about the
biological structure of viruses. For example, influenza viruses
attack only the lungs because only the lung cells have a particular
enzyme that the influenza virus needs to replicate. We also are
given excursions into the history of scientific inquiry, the
science of epidemiology and the role of disease in human history.
Thucydides, for example, suggested that the plague that struck
Athens in 431 B.C. so traumatized its citizens that the Athenians
were subsequently unable to defeat Sparta and the Peloponnesian
League.
</P>
<P>
   This forceful book ends with some chilling information.
Scientists have discovered much of the genetic sequence of this
virus, but they still do not know exactly where it came from, why
it was so deadly or if this virus, or some version of it, may
return. Even today influenza remains ``largely untreatable.''
``Flu'' made me think in new ways about viruses, epidemics, the
course of history and the future, including my own. I think I am
off to get a flu shot.

A NEW FAIR AND A NEW VIEW ON `BOUNDARIES'  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Britain, Calif., Miss., France)   By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You don't have to wait until the millennium for the
20th century to be reinvented. It's happening Saturday. The
International 20th-Century Arts Fair, which is at the Seventh
Regiment Armory on Park Avenue at 67th Street Saturday through
Wednesday, may be the first ``antiques'' fair with contemporary
works of art and design.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a psychological thing,'' said Brian Haughton, an
organizer of the fair. ``As we go over the cusp of the next
millennium, people suddenly see what was made in this century as
antique.''
</P>
<P>
   David Revere McFadden, chief curator of the American Craft
Museum and the author of an essay in the show's catalog, said:
``It's a crossover show where the normal boundaries between fields
are not being paid attention to. It may be the first time that
contemporary craft, industrial design and fine art from the turn of
the century up to the present are being shown on the same level.''
</P>
<P>
   This new fair is the fourth initiated in New York by Haughton, a
native of Dublin, and Anna Haughton, his wife. The couple, who live
in London, produce the 10-year-old International Fine Art and
Antiques Dealers Show as well as the International Asian Art Fair
and the International Fine Art Fair in the city.
</P>
<P>
   It all started in London in 1982, when Haughton, an actor turned
Bond Street porcelain dealer, put on a ceramics fair during the
Grosvenor House Fair. It was such a success that he decided to go
global.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days an object was considered antique only if it was
at least 100 years old. ``We don't feel that way,'' Mrs. Haughton
said. ``Age does not qualify a piece for quality. Nor should age
bar it.''
</P>
<P>
   The new fair is a bold move. ``It's extremely expensive to set
up a new fair,'' Haughton conceded. ``We probably won't break even
for two years.'' Unlike Sanford Smith's Modernism show, this fair
is vetted: outside experts and museum curators review each dealer's
offerings, to verify authenticity, quality and labeling. Any
questionable pieces are relabeled or removed before the show opens.
</P>
<P>
   It's also costly for the 44 exhibitors. Booth rentals are $7,000
to $40,000 for the six days, in addition to shipping, booth
decoration and lodging costs.
</P>
<P>
   Some dealers are also nervous about having a show over the
Thanksgiving weekend. ``We know that 55 percent of our other fair
visitors are from out of town,'' Haughton said. ``We went ahead
after we learned that this weekend is one of the busiest ones at
the Met.''
</P>
<P>
   The fair (information: 212-642-8572) was also timed to coincide
with the 20th-century auctions. Christie's East is conducting its
first ``Important Design'' sale Saturday at 219 East 67th Street,
and Christie's ``Important 20th-Century Decorative Arts'' sale is
on Monday. Saturday Sotheby's begins previews for its 20th-century
decorative arts sales, to be held on Dec. 3 and 4. Treadway Toomey
Galleries' 20th-century auction, with 1,116 lots, will be held on
Dec. 4 and 5 in Oak Park, Ill. The Phillips 20th-century design
sale is Dec. 7 in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's East has fine examples of Bauhaus furniture; early
Noguchi pieces designed for Zenith, Knoll and Herman Miller; a 1943
molded plywood Eames sculpture; and several less well known
offerings. Among the latter are a tubular steel and caned armchair
designed in 1931 by Erich Dieckmann, who studied at the Bauhaus in
the early 1920's, and a mirror with a spiraling glass frame
designed by the Italian architect Gio Ponti for Venini about 1938.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia architect Robert Venturi designed chairs for
Knoll International between 1979 and 1984. His whimsical takeoffs
on the Chippendale, Queen Anne, Gothic and Art Nouveau styles are
in laminated plywood painted in bright colors. Christie's East is
selling five models that never went into production, each estimated
at $3,000 to $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's decorative arts sale includes six vessels by George
Ohr (1857-1918), a Mississippi art potter. (Abbeville published a
fascinating illustrated 1989 biography of Ohr, ``The Mad Potter of
Biloxi,'' by Garth Clark, Robert A. Ellison Jr. and Eugene Hecht.)
Ohr made bizarrely shaped vases with paper-thin folded walls and
sumptuous glazes. One bowl for sale looks like a green-flecked
gourd. A spotted purple pitcher has a curled back rim. Estimates
range from $3,000 to $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Lot 102 is a Deco piano designed by Jacques-Emile Ruhlmann in
the 1920s that is as important historically as aesthetically. Made
of exotic striped Macassar ebony and Amboina wood with ivory
inlays, it was designed for the Paris Exposition of 1925, which
gave Art Deco its name.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's auctions include six lots of Ruhlmann furniture that
Altina Schinasi Miranda purchased on her Paris honeymoon in 1928,
including an amaranth and sharkskin-covered dressing table, a
burled elm desk and an amaranth chest. A New York artist, designer
and filmmaker, she was credited with creating Harlequin eyeglasses,
the large glasses made famous by Clare Boothe Luce and Katharine
Cornell. The designer married four times and lived in Los Angeles,
Washington and Santa Fe, but always had her Ruhlmanns with her.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillips 20th-century sale has a molded glass vase from the
Lalique series ``Tourbillions,'' of etched swirls that suggest
whirlwinds. First introduced at the 1925 Paris Exposition, the vase
was made in many colors. Lot 49 is a brilliant turquoise, a result
of adding cobalt to the glass before firing, an expense reserved
for the finest pieces. Estimate: $50,000 to $60,000.
</P>
<P>
   A stunning Deco steel gate attributed to Gilbert Poillerat has
overlapping steel circles that look like bubbles. ``The way it has
been constructed and the workmanship is closely in line with
Poillerat's studio,'' said Lora Krizelman, director of 20th-century
decorative arts at Phillips. Its estimate is $15,000 to $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   At the Haughtons' fair, Historical Design is showing a white
Secessionist vase designed by Karl Klaus in 1911 with silver and
gold motifs. It was in a 1912 show, ``New Interiors by Viennese
Architects,'' at the Museum for Art and Industry in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   The Gansevoort Gallery is selling a lamp designed in 1928-29 by
the Danish architect Poul Henningsen (1894-1967). The shade is made
from three upside-down brass saucers, to cut glare. McFadden
illustrated his catalog essay with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henningsen understood technology and engineering so well that
he created a new aesthetic,'' McFadden said. ``He knew how to
create magical light. He had an artistic approach informed by
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The 20th-century decorative arts have become a big business.
Lars Rachen of Christie's New York said sales from its 20th-century
department (not including Christie's East) totaled $28 million last
year, and that was without anything like the celebrity sale of
Barbra Streisand's Arts and Crafts collection scheduled for Monday.
Sotheby's 20th-century department in New York made $17 million last
year.
</P>
<P>
   So now let's see how the Haughtons do.  &QL;

   It takes Randy Newman just 2 minutes and 43 seconds to deliver
``The World Isn't Fair,'' the year's most searching song about the
state of the Union on the edge of the millennium, from his recent
album, ``Bad Love.'' Carrying on a one-sided conversation with Karl
Marx, the singer, in his most insinuating pseudo-New Orleans drawl,
regales the dead philosopher with a personal anecdote about
attending a private-school orientation at which the trophy wives
and mothers were as beautiful as princesses, and their husbands
(including himself) looked like frogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be glad that you're dead,'' he tells Marx, after explaining
sadly that the philosopher's idealistic theories, when applied to
real life, ended up bringing only misery. Then he adds: ``Just like
I'm glad I'm living in the land of the free/Where the rich just get
richer/And the poor you don't ever have to see/It would depress us,
Karl/Because we care/That the world isn't fair.'' Ouch!
</P>
<P>
   ``The World Isn't Fair'' is a lean little song for a fat era.
And in cutting against the grain of a pop-music climate in which so
many younger songwriters spill all their feelings out in messy,
sloppily rhymed and metered, often impenetrable five- and
six-minute effusions, it can be taken as an aesthetic guidepost to
this critic's annual adult pop consumer guide.
</P>
<P>
   Another model of restraint, thoughtfulness and craft, from a
different area of music, is Diana Krall's performance of Irving
Berlin's ``Let's Face the Music and Dance,'' on her recent album,
``When I Look in Your Eyes.'' Like Newman's song, this Berlin
classic, from the 1936 movie ``Follow the Fleet,'' silhouettes
present pleasures against the darker backdrop (``soon we will be
without the moon/humming a different tune'') of a looming world
war.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Krall's rendition, half murmured in a dark, slightly husky
alto and delivered with no ornamental frills, is an ominous
countercurrent pulling against a gossamer bossa nova arrangement by
Johnny Mandel. Throughout this album of standards, Ms. Krall
carries forward the intensely focused vocal minimalism of singers
like Peggy Lee and the young Nat ``King'' Cole, injecting a dash of
Carmen McRae's hard-headed psychological insight. Her emotive
understatement and utter lack of exhibitionism attest to her
astonishing integrity in a flamboyant vocal era of improvisatory
showoffs, melismatic overkill and wretchedly excessive belting.
</P>
<P>
   What Newman and Ms. Krall represent, in very different forms, is
an intractable artistic high-mindedness in a contemporary musical
climate overrun and corrupted by marketing. The artistic ill
effects of that marketing mentality are painfully evident on the
latest albums by singers like Celine Dion, Barbra Streisand, Mariah
Carey and Paula Cole. One of several new cuts on ``All the Way: A
Decade of Song'' (Epic/550 Music), Ms. Dion's just-released
greatest hits album, is a gimmicky, beyond-the-grave duet with
Frank Sinatra that sounds as though it were emanating from some
rhinestone-studded station in outer space rather than from the
heart.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of two hardy show tunes, ``Isn't It a Pity''
and ``The Music That Makes Me Dance,'' Ms. Streisand's wedding
album, ``A Love Like Ours'' (Columbia), is a smarmy package of
overproduced, predigested schlock mostly crooned in a voice that
shows the Streisand sound to be intact. But the emotional
risk-taking and commitment to superior songs that made Ms.
Streisand great have all but vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Following the trend toward youthful street music, Ms. Carey is
aggressively pursuing ``street credibility'' on her new, heavily
hip-hop flavored album, ``Rainbow'' (Columbia), and undercutting
her vocal strengths to achieve it.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cole's song lyrics on ``Amen'' (Imago/Warner Brgthers), her
follow-up to the hugely successful ``This Fire'' (which contained
the hit ``Where Have All the Cowboys Gone?''), are dragged down by
a forced, strident preachiness that is also mirrored in the
singing.
</P>
<P>
   These and numerous other disappointing adult-oriented albums are
symptoms of a climate in which mainstream pop radio has virtually
eliminated adult contemporary music from its play lists. It used to
be that a powerful, straightforward ballad like Bette Midler's
``From a Distance'' could buck the trends and make its way up the
charts. But those days are gone. As any major-label record company
marketing expert will tell you, releasing an album without a
potential hit single is a commercially risky proposition.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the most startling indication of how far the pop
pendulum has swung toward rude, beat-driven street music was the
MTV Music Video Awards, at which what might be called lout music
(fusions of rap and metal) held sway. Raging testosterone ruled.
</P>
<P>
   What then is an old fogey who still harbors a passion for pop
music to do? Following is a selection of pop and a few jazz albums
(listed alphabetically by artist) recommended for people over 40 or
thereabouts. Some may be challenging for middle-of-the-road tastes.
(Compact discs range in price from $15.97 to $18.97.)
</P>
<P>
   ``TONY BENNETT SINGS ELLINGTON HOT AND COOL'' (RPM/Columbia).
Bennett sings 14 Duke Ellington songs, from swingers to lush
ballads, with his usual heartfelt bonhomie and a swinging authority
that's so assured that rhythm seems to be seeping out of his pores.
But why did he feel obliged to change ``I've Got It Bad (and That
Ain't Good)'' to ``She's Got It Bad''?
</P>
<P>
   ``IBRAHIM FERRER'' (World Circuit/Nonesuch). This great old-time
Cuban singer whose career was resurrected by Ry Cooder's Buena
Vista Social Club has been compared to Nat ``King'' Cole. And there
is a distant resemblance in the relaxed dreaminess of his crooning.
Cooder produced this solo album, in which Ferrer (backed by an
assembly of top-notch Cuban musicians) sings everything from
string-laden boleros that almost seem to float in the air to
harder-edged pre-salsa numbers.
</P>
<P>
   BRYAN FERRY: ``AS TIME GOES BY'' (Virgin). The epitome of
high-toned British suavity with a rock twist applies his twirling
vibrato to 15 popular standards. The loose swinging chamber
arrangements (some with strings) have a Django Reinhardt lilt.
Tasteful and fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ADAM GUETTEL: ``MYTHS AND HYMNS'' (Nonesuch). If the next
generation of theater composers is to rise above the grandiose
schlock of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Frank Wildhorn, Guettel (Richard
Rodgers' grandson) has the melodic brilliance to lead the charge.
His debut album of original music features a top-flight rotating
cast, including the composer, singing songs inspired by Greek myths
and Protestant hymns. Lofty but accessible and intensely
passionate.
</P>
<P>
   ``CHARLIE HADEN AND QUARTET WEST: ``THE ART OF SONG'' (Verve).
In this languidly moody album, the eminent bassist and his group _
the pianist Alan Broadbent, the saxophonist Ernie Watts and the
drummer Larence Marable _ rummage through a collection of standards
with Bill Henderson and Shirley Horn as guest vocalists and a small
orchestra. Killer cuts: Ms. Horn's quiet, string-swaddled versions
of ``I'm Gonna Laugh You Right Out of My Life'' and ``The Folks Who
Live on the Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   FRED HERSCH: ``LET YOURSELF GO'' (Nonesuch). An unaccompanied
solo concert is the ultimate test of a jazz pianist. This
impressive solo album, which includes works by composers ranging
from Weill to Monk (and including an original composition), is
knotty, idea-filled and absorbing. Just when it threatens to become
too intellectual, it relaxes into sunbursts of feeling. It
concludes with a version of ``The Nearness of You'' that Keith
Jarrett might envy.
</P>
<P>
   DIANA KRALL: ``WHEN I LOOK IN YOUR EYES'' (Verve). In her first
orchestrated album (by Johnny Mandel), this British Columbian jazz
singer and pianist takes another huge artistic step forward. Its
heart-stopping centerpiece is the title song, written by Leslie
Bricusse for the movie ``Dr. Doolittle,'' of all things. More
performances like this and Ms. Krall will find herself counted
among the greats.
</P>
<P>
   ALISON KRAUSS: ``FORGET ABOUT IT'' (Rounder). Ms. Krauss'
delicate, silver-threaded voice is one of the tenderest in all
country music. Here she applies it to wistful pop nuggets like Todd
Rundgren's ``It Wouldn't Have Made Any Difference'' and the killer
cut, ``Empty Hearts'' (by Michael McDonald and Michael Johnson).
</P>
<P>
   PAUL McCARTNEY: ``RUN DEVIL RUN'' (Capitol). The former Beatle
revisits the early days of rock 'n' roll with an infectious
exuberance, mixing original '50s-style songs with golden oldies by
Elvis, Ricky Nelson, Chuck Berry and others. Well done.
</P>
<P>
   MICHELLE NDEGEOCELLO: ``BITTER'' (Maverick). This suite of songs
about sexual betrayal slices to the bone and is delivered in an
intimate speech-song that finds every shade of meaning in the word
``bitter.'' Craig Street's production fleshes out Ms. Ndegeocello's
inner world with a quirky subterranean ambience.
</P>
<P>
   RANDY NEWMAN: ``BAD LOVE'' (DreamWorks). An artistic key to
Newman's serious fun is the way he incriminates himself in his
stinging first-person critiques. One example in ``Bad Love'' is his
admission in ``I Miss You,'' a pining love song to a distant
ex-wife, that he is selling his soul by exploiting their
relationship in the song. And by implicating himself, he implicates
us. As for the music on ``Bad Love,'' it is as spare and allusive
as ever, with styles from New Orleans marching bands to echoes of
Mahler, and with tunes that stick.
</P>
<P>
   BRENDAN PERRY: ``EYE OF THE HUNTER'' (4AD). These arching gothic
folk-pop ballads by the male half of the defunct duo Dead Can Dance
echo the gloomy grandeur of Leonard Cohen, with Perry sounding at
moments like Bruce Springsteen at his most ruminative, with an
added touch of Neil Diamond. The haunting, somewhat morbid album
has the kind of music that inspires cults.
</P>
<P>
   PET SHOP BOYS: ``NIGHTLIFE'' (WEA/Sire). Orchestrally
embellished disco remains the British duo's chosen medium. But the
songs (which deal with gay culture and relationships) continue to
deepen. Songs like ``I Don't Know What You Want But I Can't Give It
Anymore'' and ``You Only Tell Me You Love Me When You're Drunk''
plunge us into the well-heeled urban jungle.
</P>
<P>
   JOHN PRINE: ``IN SPITE OF OURSELVES'' (Oh Boy). The
singer-songwriter, whose voice is as plain as dirt, duets with Iris
DeMent, Lucinda Williams, Trisha Yearwood, Emmylou Harris, Melba
Montgomery and others in this collection of 15 country classics
augmented with one brilliant original, the title song sung with Ms.
DeMent. What you get is the raw texture of life in an idealized,
rollicking portrait of the rural South decades before ``Urban
Cowboy.''
</P>
<P>
   SANTANA: ``SUPERNATURAL'' (Arista). A rare case of inspired
multimarketing savvy (credit the Arista Records chief Clive Davis)
brought the great guitarist Carlos Santana back to the top of the
charts by teaming him with everyone from Dave Matthews (crooning
``Love of My Life'') and the gravelly voiced Rob Thomas (the
pop-salsa hit ``Smooth'') to the hip-hopper Lauryn Hill (``Do You
Like the Way'') to his fellow guitar giant Eric Clapton (the
crunchy, gospel-flavored ``The Calling''). Stylistically diffuse
and gimmicky, but still worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   RON SEXSMITH: ``WHEREABOUTS'' (Interscope). The singer and
songwriter's wonderful third album of pared-down parables and
exquisitely calibrated mood swings is like a private primer of
rueful, sometimes scarily wise apercus. They're rendered without a
wasted word or note in a voice whose shy, quavering intensity
echoes Tim Hardin.
</P>
<P>
   STING: ``BRAND NEW DAY'' (A&AMP;M). Sting's ambition to be all
things to all musical genres, from bossa nova to country to North
African music, can exceed his accomplishment; his country songs
sound forced. But when he lands a knockout punch like ``A Thousand
Years,'' a hypnotic chant that spirals into the stars along a minor
key, pop music doesn't get more deeply entrancing.
</P>
<P>
   ``DAWN UPSHAW SINGS VERNON DUKE'' (Nonesuch). Lovely,
beautifully measured performances of songs by the underappreciated
composer of ``Autumn in New York'' and ''April in Paris.''
</P>
<P>
   CAETANO VELOSO: ``LIVRO'' (Nonesuch). The music on this
far-reaching album by Brazil's greatest singing poet is about as
diverse as that nation's countryside, with feathery love songs
juxtaposed with percussive carnival sambas, and subject matter
ranging from the beauty of books to the life of Alexander the
Great. The album has the color and scope of a sprawling mural
created by a hypersensitive pantheist.
</P>
<P>
   CASSANDRA WILSON: ``TRAVELING MILES'' (Blue Note). Ms. Wilson's
tribute to the spirit of Miles Davis, whose music she has set with
brilliant impressionistic lyrics that mirror his mixture of
romanticism and bitter sarcasm, is an extraordinary collision of
sensibilities. Both as a lyricist and a singer, Ms. Wilson matches
Davis in the depth and twisting complexity of her singing and
writing.
</P>
<P>
   JESSE WINCHESTER: ``GENTLEMAN OF LEISURE'' (Sugar Hill). The
gifted singer-songwriter, seldom heard from since the 1970s (and
even then under-recognized), resurfaces with an album of original
blues and soul-tinged country-folk songs. The lyrics are diamond
hard and confessional. His rich, silky baritone, shot through with
vulnerability, is as compelling as ever. Killer cuts: ``That's What
Makes You Strong'' and ``No Pride at All.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the principle that there are no small shows, only
small artists, the six paintings brought together for ``Velazquez
in New York Museums'' at the Frick Collection add up to a very big
show indeed.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion is the 400th anniversary of the birth of Diego de
Velazquez (1599-1660), and to honor it the Frick has surrounded its
own splendiferous portrait of King Philip IV of Spain with an
intimate, A-list gathering of nearly all the paintings by this
baroque master in local public collections.
</P>
<P>
   Two are from the Metropolitan Museum, including the famous
``Juan de Pareja.'' (A third, the early ``Supper at Emmaus,'' could
not be lent, because of restrictions attached to its bequest. It's
on view at the Met now.) And new to many viewers will be three
works owned by the Hispanic Society of America that have not left
their northern Manhattan home in 90 years.
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen paintings presented in a strictly no-frills
installation feels a mite thin, hardly a show at all in the age of
the megaretrospective. But Velazquez didn't paint much; only
100-plus works survive, the bulk now in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   There have been several explanations for his skimpy output. His
chief patron, Philip IV, called him lethargic, which was a nice way
of saying lazy. The art historian Jonathan Brown, who organized the
show, points to conflicted ambition: Velazquez wanted to be a
gentleman more than he wanted to be a painter (the two were
mutually exclusive in 17th-century Spain), so he turned on creative
steam only when he absolutely had to.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, a handful of Velazquezes packs more of a
punch than a museumful of work by nearly anyone else of his time.
And the six paintings at the Frick neatly manage to touch on key
periods in a 40-year career.
</P>
<P>
   At the turn of the 17th century, Spain was the most powerful
country in Europe but artistically somewhat out of the Continental
loop. Velazquez, born in Seville, had the luck to be apprenticed to
the painter Francisco Pacheco, a cosmopolitan man who grounded his
students in classical art and literature.
</P>
<P>
   The young artist developed a precocious, eye-catching realist
style and from the start had his sights set on an appointment at
the Spanish court. The opportunity came through Gaspar de Guzman,
Count-Duke of Olivares, whose full-length portrait by Velazquez,
from the Hispanic Society, is the earliest entry in the show.
</P>
<P>
   Olivares had made himself an indispensable adviser to the newly
crowned Philip IV. And his demeanor in the portrait, at once
baby-faced and commanding, suggests his appeal to an insecure king
still in, or barely out of, his teens. Olivares was interested in
art and had personal links to Seville. So it was inevitable that
Velazquez would come to his attention and be brought to Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   There he landed the job of court painter, a position he held for
decades. His main assignment was as royal portraitist, and Philip
would have no other, except Rubens, who visited the Spanish court
briefly. From the Frick portrait one can understand why.
</P>
<P>
   Painted in 1644 just after a Spanish military victory, it was
whipped up on a tight deadline in a makeshift studio near the
battlefield. The result was pure propaganda: the equivalent of a
victory photo taken at the front. But in it the artist integrates
his early penchant for unidealized realism with the Titianesque,
proto-impressionist brushwork of his mature style.
</P>
<P>
   The king's face, with its high, pale forehead and massive
Hapsburg chin, is exactingly executed: One can almost see the pulse
beating at his thin-skinned temple. But his silver-embroidered
jacket is something else: an atomized flurry of white and black
daubs, a painterly illusion of scintillating fabric.
</P>
<P>
   Velazquez also made promotional images of Philip's family. When
the infanta Maria Teresa came of marriageable age, she was heavily
advertised in portraits sent to the French and Austrian courts.
(She ended up as queen of France, married to Louis XIV.) Velazquez
produced the prototype studies for them, an example of which is on
loan from the Met.
</P>
<P>
   Executed quickly by a painter who helped establish
``unfinished'' as a new category of masterpiece, it depicts a
self-composed young woman who is also a kind of living sculpture:
Her bean-shaped, rouged face is surmounted by a boulderlike wig on
which bows seem to have alighted like butterflies.
</P>
<P>
   The other portraits in the exhibition are of less socially
exalted beings. Among them is the Hispanic Society's picture of
Camillo Astalli, known as Cardinal Pamphili, painted in Rome late
in the artist's career.
</P>
<P>
   Astalli was a distant relative of Pope Innocent X and, for
reasons no one could quite figure out, was elevated overnight to a
position of tremendous power. Velazquez, who had come to Italy to
buy art for Philip, was counting on the pope to help him secure a
Spanish knighthood and produced a sparkling portrait of the papal
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Velazquez eventually got his knighthood, but Astalli's career
was over in a flash. He leaked military secrets from the Vatican,
but was found out and stripped of every privilege. The Roman
establishment was glad to see him go; he had a reputation for being
a wise guy, and there's a hint of this in the portrait, in which he
wears his cardinal's hat at a cocky, home-boy angle.
</P>
<P>
   About the likeness of Juan de Pareja, also painted in Rome, much
has been written since it was bought by the Met in 1971. The
sitter, of Muslim descent, was Velazquez's slave and studio
assistant and an artist in his own right. Velazquez intended the
painting to be his professional calling card in Italy; it was
renowned in its day, and still is, as one of the supreme European
portraits.
</P>
<P>
   There is a final portrait in the show, however, of which
virtually nothing at all is known. It is a small, unfinished,
bust-length likeness of a little girl with dark hair and eyes and
luminous, light-bathed skin. She has sometimes been identified as
Velazquez's granddaughter, but there is no firm evidence for this.
</P>
<P>
   What can be said is that she represents a rare departure from
this artist's cool, courtly approach to the human subject. He was
impressed by many of his royal sitters, and he made them look
impressive in turn. But he clearly loved this grave child, as
anyone will who encounters her today.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   She is seldom seen except by habitues of the Hispanic Society's
headquarters at 155th Street and Broadway, where she usually
resides. And the most valuable function of the Frick show may be to
draw attention to the Hispanic Society itself. It is a gold mine of
Spanish and Latin American art, and two of its images give a sense
of its scope.
</P>
<P>
   One is a painting by Velazquez's contemporary Zurbaran of St.
Rufina depicted as a Spanish beauty dressed to the nines in rose
pink and apple green, her eyes cast heavenward.
</P>
<P>
   The other is a portrait by Goya of his formidable mistress, the
duchess of Alba, who stands hand on hip, staring straight out, with
a finger pointing to the ground as if to say, ``Kneel, you besotted
wretch.'' (Goya's name is written in the sand at her feet.)
</P>
<P>
   She's divine, as is much else in a collection that embraces
painting by El Greco and Ribera, monumental Gothic tomb sculptures,
Hispano-Islamic ivories and a huge collection of printed books from
Spain and the New World, all adding up to one of the city's
unforgettable museum experiences.
</P>
<P>
   The Frick Collection, needless to say, is another. And it is
seen at its generous best in ``Velazquez in New York Museums,'' a
show that might best be approached as the visual equivalent of
chamber music _ an instrumental sextet _ modest in scale, rich in
tonal variety and in execution beyond compare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Velazquez in New York Museums'' remains at The Frick
Collection, 1 East 70th St., New York, (212) 288-0700, through Jan.
16. The exhibition is a collaboration between the Frick and the
Hispanic Society of America.

   BUSINESS-CONGRESS (Washington) _ Democrats call it a do-nothing
Congress; Republicans are only slightly more enthusiastic, saying
it was all that could be expected with such narrow majorities in
the House and Senate and a Democratic president. But business
lobbies like the Chamber of Commerce think they had a great year in
Congress. Not only did they get most of what they wanted, but they

   RESEARCH-DEVELOPING-NATIONS (Undated) _ Angry that they have not
profited from the animal and plant life within their borders,
Ecuador and many other developing countries have begun restricting
the freedom of scientists to collect biological samples and
demanding compensation in exchange for permits. Some scientists
warn that scores of research projects that might lead to

   CHICAGO-LESSON-PLANS (Chicago) _ Though almost every American
school district has begun, in just the last three years, to check
student progress against specified academic standards, the nation's
third largest district has gone a giant step further this year:
supplying every teacher with a virtual script, a detailed,
day-by-day outline of what he or she should be teaching _ and when
_ in the language arts, mathematics, science and social studies.
The standardized lesson plans, which were drafted over two years by
a committee of 100 teachers, are optional. But central
administrators, most notably the system's chief executive, Paul
Vallas, have made clear that all teachers should draw on the
lessons in some way _ and many apparently are. By Jacques

Thursday. By Thursday night, according to differing accounts from
the shipping company and the New China News Agency, either 22 or 36

   Heavy rains are possible across the central Appalachians from
the mountains of West Virginia to the high ground of western and
central Pennsylvania as moist Atlantic air is drawn up the sloping
terrain ahead of the cold front. Moderate to locally heavy rains
are also possible across parts of the eastern Great Lakes in
northwest Pennsylvania and western New York.
</P>
<P>
   Increasing ocean winds, averaging 15 to 30 mph, will import
moisture across the Northeast Seaboard, paving the way for low
clouds, patchy drizzle or spotty showers. However, the brunt of the
rain associated with the approaching system will stay west of the
Northeast Seaboard on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, strong gusts will lash parts of eastern Colorado as
fast winds cresting the lofty Rockies careen down eastern slopes.
Gusts could exceed 70 mph in spots. In the Pacific Northwest, the
siege of wet weather will gradually ease from north to south as a
Pacific ridge of high pressure builds toward the coast at 18,000
feet. Nonetheless, some heavy snow is still possible in the
mountains of southwest Oregon and parts of northern California. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: High Winds &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A high wind warning was posted Thursday for the mountains and
foothills of northeast and north-central Colorado. Gusts to 100
miles an hour were expected in some of the high mountain passes at
elevations above 10,000 feet. Strong winds cresting the Rockies
Thursday careened down eastern slopes, setting the stage for high
winds in the valleys below. Strong winds also brought warmth as air
descending the eastern slopes warmed rapidly by compression. Strong
``Chinook'' winds are again possible Friday in parts of eastern
Colorado, with gusts of 70 mph or more in a few places.

INSIDE ART: NEW AUCTION FOR OLD MASTERS; AGREEING TO DISAGREE;
PAINTING STAYING PUT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (lb) 
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   More prized works of art confiscated by the Nazis and recently
returned to their rightful owners are coming to auction. The latest
_ old-master paintings by artists including Tiepolo, Canaletto and
Strozzi _ follow the hugely successful auction of art and
decorative objects in June by the Austrian branch of the Rothschild
family at Christie's in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chicness and high profile of the Rothschild sale did bring
other things to the surface,'' said Anthony Crichton-Stuart, head
of Christie's old-master paintings department in New York.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 27, Christie's in New York will be selling six
old-master paintings that had belonged to Federico Gentili di
Giuseppe, an Italian businessman who lived in Paris. After
Giuseppe's death in 1941, his family fled occupied France for the
United States, leaving the art in Paris. That same year, a
Nazi-appointed administrator sold the paintings in a forced sale at
a hotel there.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, the Allies turned over five of the paintings
to the French government, which exhibited them at the Louvre under
the label ``Musees Nationaux Recuperation.'' The sixth was bought
in 1941 by a German dealer, who sold it to the Gemaeldegalerie in
Berlin in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two years Giuseppe's heirs have petitioned the
French and German governments, claiming that the paintings were
rightfully theirs and that the 1941 sale was illegal. Earlier this
year, the French and German governments returned the paintings to
the family.
</P>
<P>
   Included in Christie's sale is Tiepolo's ``Apelles Painting
Campaspe'' from the late 1730s. The easel-size painting depicts
Alexander the Great and his favorite concubine, Campaspe, being
painted by Alexander's court painter, Apelles. (While working on
the painting, Apelles fell in love with Campaspe, and Alexander
allowed them to marry.)
</P>
<P>
   Tiepolo painted this subject three times. ``This is the last
version,'' Crichton-Stuart said. ``It has a sober dignity and
elegance typical of the artist's more classical period.'' Its
estimate is $1.5 million to $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Also for sale is a Tiepolo sketch, ``Rinaldo Abandoning Armida''
(circa 1752-1753), estimated at $600,000 to $800,000. It had been
on view at the Gemaeldegalerie. A third work is Strozzi's ``Holy
Family,'' which dates from his mature period, 1620-1632, and also
carries an estimate of $600,000 to $800,000.
</P>
<P>
   Although London is traditionally the center of the old-master
market, the sale will be in New York. ``There has been a succession
of successful Tiepolo shows in this country,'' Crichton-Stuart
explained. ``We think the market is particularly strong here for
Italian pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   Agreeing to Disagree
</P>
<P>
   Herzog &AMP; de Meuron, the architects who won an international
competition last year to design the Jack S. Blanton Museum of Art
at the University of Texas in Austin, have resigned from the
project after months of trying to resolve aesthetic differences
with the school's Board of Regents.
</P>
<P>
   The 150,000-square-foot, $60 million museum, at one of the main
entrances to the campus, was scheduled for completion in January
2002. Now the project is expected to be delayed at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   The selection committee that chose Herzog &AMP; de Meuron and the
Board of Regents were separate entities with different
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem was that the architects were hired by one group
but they ended up working for another,'' said Larry Faulkner,
president of the university.
</P>
<P>
   After submitting 14 models and three different schemes to house
the more than 700 works of European art in the museum's
collections, Herzog &AMP; de Meuron settled on a one-story building,
like a garden pavilion, with a central courtyard, atriums and an
undulating roof of red and clear tiles.
</P>
<P>
   The regents preferred a more traditional two- or three-story
building and wanted Texas limestone and a red tile roof, which
board members said would be more compatible with the campus master
plan. That plan calls for new buildings to be similar in style to
those on the original campus, many of which were designed by the
architect Paul Cret.
</P>
<P>
   ``The selection committee was looking for cutting-edge
architecture while the Board of Regents were more traditional, and
they weren't happy with our design approach,'' said Harry Gugger,
Herzog &AMP; de Meuron's project manager for the job. ``We were not
prepared to compromise our architectural philosophy and felt it was
better to free up the university, allowing them to make a fresh
start.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulkner said the university would ``pick up the pieces and
start again with an architectural committee that has a stronger
connection to the Board of Regents.''
</P>
<P>
   Herzog &AMP; de Meuron, based in Basel, Switzerland, is completing
the new Tate Gallery of Modern Art in London, which is to open this
spring, and is also designing the new home of the de Young Museum
in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Painting Staying Put
</P>
<P>
   The Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas, will not get
Botticelli's ``Virgin Adoring the Christ Child'' (circa 1480), a
$24 million painting being sold by the Wemyss Heirloom Trust from
the Earl of Wemyss home in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago the Kimbell applied for an export license to allow
the painting to leave Britain, but Britain's Lottery Fund has
raised three-quarters of the money needed to match the museum's
offer and keep the painting in Britain, and other funds have
contributed the rest. The painting went on view this week at the
National Galleries of Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things happen,'' said Timothy Potts, director of the
Kimbell. ``I am pleased that it is going into a public
collection.''
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Mauro, managing director of Dickinson Roundell in New
York, whose London gallery represented the trust, said: ``We're
obviously sad this painting is not coming to America after so much
effort was put into acquiring it for the Kimbell. But we are
pleased it is going into a museum in the United Kingdom.''

   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `AMERICAN BEAUTY,' starring Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Chris
Cooper, Wes Bentley and Thora Birch. Written by Alan Ball. Directed
by Sam Mendes (R, 116 minutes). With heavenly finesse, Spacey plays
a buttoned-down 42-year-old suburbanite who flips his lid for a
teen-age cheerleader. And he never gets it back on. The midlife
crisis motif is familiar, but the stage director Sam Mendes brings
terrific visual flair and dry humor to this barbecuing of the
bourgeoisie. All the actors display coolly expert timing,
especially Ms. Bening as the antihero's grasping wife. Although the
story spreads itself thin among many characters, the film coalesces
for a devastating finale (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE BUENA VISTA SOCIAL CLUB,' with Ibrahim Ferrer, Compay
Segundo and Ry Cooder. Directed by Wim Wenders (not rated, 106
minutes). When the American guitarist and producer Ry Cooder
assembled a group of all-but-forgotten Cuban musicians to record an
album, no one expected that the record would become a phenomenon,
selling more than a million copies worldwide and revitalizing the
Cuban music scene. Wenders' ebullient documentary follows the group
on tour from Amsterdam, Netherlands, to New York and includes
interviews with the group's main members. The music pulsates, and
the pictures of Havana compare the city's grand but faded
architecture with the musicians' weather-beaten faces (Stephen
Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `AMERICAN MOVIE,' featuring Mark Borchardt and friends. Directed
by Chris Smith (R, 104 minutes). An insightful, funny,
not-to-be-missed documentary about a no-budget Wisconsin filmmaker
who makes a horror film as if his life depended on it. And as Smith
so affectingly reveals, Borchardt's hopes really do hang in the
balance. This knowing and often hilarious look at try-anything
indie filmmaking becomes a moving portrait of one man's uphill
struggle and finds Borchardt often describing success and
prosperity as his goals. Meanwhile his own life is eloquently
presented as a very different, no less authentic kind of American
Dream (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `ANYWHERE BUT HERE,' starring Susan Sarandon and Natalie
Portman. Directed by Wayne Wang (PG-13, 113 minutes). In a knowing
film adaptation of Mona Simpson's widely praised, if not often
wildly eventful, first novel, Ms. Sarandon is show-stopping as the
14-year-old heroine's mother and main nemesis. And Ms. Portman, who
proves her mettle in a fully formed dramatic role, does a terrific
job of holding her own in the film's battle of wills. Even when the
material meanders, Wang supplies insightful, affectionate
direction, just as he did for ``The Joy Luck Club.'' A women's
picture made with feeling and acted with great flair (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `BEING JOHN MALKOVICH,' starring John Cusack, Catherine Keener,
Cameron Diaz and (of course) John Malkovich. Written by Charlie
Kaufman and directed by Spike Jonze (R, 112 minutes). Welcome to
the fun house: In this exhilaratingly quirky first feature by a
stellar video director, the reigning fears and obsessions of a
technology-crazed, voyeuristic culture are given an even wilder
workout than they got from ``The Truman Show.'' Cusack plays a
discouraged puppeteer who accidentally finds a way into Malkovich's
mind. While the ordinary science-fiction plot might go downhill
after revealing its gimmick, this one's inspired craziness goes on
and on. Originality and cleverness abound (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE BACHELOR,' starring Chris O'Donnell and Renee Zellweger.
Directed by Gary Sinyor (PG-13, 90 minutes). This crude, frantic
yuppie farce stars O'Donnell as a selfish, marriage-shy bachelor
who botches his proposal to his sweetheart (Ms. Zellweger) days
before his grandfather dies and leaves him $100 million on the
condition he marry before his 30th birthday. That gives him 27
hours either to win back his true love or find another wife. After
running through his ex-girlfriends, he finds himself besieged by a
horde of prospective brides chasing him through the streets of San
Francisco. Based on a 1925 Buster Keaton classic, the movie lands a
few satiric thrusts at the money-mad workaholic '90s (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `THE BONE COLLECTOR,' starring Denzel Washington and Angelina
Jolie. Directed by Phillip Noyce (R, 118 minutes). One of the
year's most gruesome movies, the ingenious but preposterous
whodunit stars Washington as a quadriplegic forensic detective
tracking down a serial killer who plays cat and mouse with him by
leaving elaborate clues at the crime scenes. Ms. Jolie is the
police officer (and former model) whom he instructs by cell phone
on how to gather evidence. Crammed with the usual manipulative
jolts, this urban creepshow at least succeeds in sustaining an
atmosphere of menace, and Washington's and Ms. Jolie's star
chemistry smolders without the two exchanging so much as a kiss
(Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `BOYS DON'T CRY,' starring Hillary Swank and Chloe Sevigny.
Directed by Kimberley Pierce (R, 114 minutes). This stunning debut
feature tells the strange and resonant story of Brandon Teena, who
despite being born Teena Brandon went on to create a charismatic
identity as a young man. Brandon's ultimately wrenching tale may
sound tabloid-ready, but on screen it turns into Theodore Dreiser's
idea of American tragedy. The film makes it hauntingly real and
even tenderly romantic, with the astonishing acting needed to make
it work. One of the year's best (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `BRINGING OUT THE DEAD,' starring Nicolas Cage and Patricia
Arquette. Written by Paul Schrader from a novel by Joe Connelly.
Directed by Martin Scorsese (R, 115 minutes). An intense, volatile
film full of sorrow and wild, mordant humor. This time it took prop
garbage on the streets of Hell's Kitchen to create a sufficiently
hellish ambience for another nighttime tour of Manhattan. But
Scorsese has mellowed significantly since his ``Taxi Driver'' days,
and his uneven but impassioned, visually inventive new film is more
contemplative than it looks. Cage gives a fine, soulful performance
as a New York ambulance driver haunted by ghosts. Ving Rhames is a
major scene-stealer as one of his partners (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `DOGMA,' starring Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Linda Fiorentino,
Chris Rock and Salma Hayek. Directed by Kevin Smith (R, 130
minutes). Smith's idea of angels in America is the notion of two
cool dudes who take a hair-splitting, legalese approach to Roman
Catholic doctrine and think it would be amusing to nullify all
existence. And nothing in this wildly brazen, unexpectedly devout
comedy is any less outrageous than that. Smith again shows off a
rare gift for fusing his comic-book sensibility with serious
debates and big, big laughs, even if some parts of his film (Ms.
Fiorentino's performance, Rock's and semi-repartee from the
ubiquitous Jay and Silent Bob) work better than others (an
excrement monster). Making a gutsy leap into matters of faith,
Smith miraculously emerges with his humor intact and his wings
unsinged (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `FELICIA'S JOURNEY,' starring Elaine Cassidy and Bob Hoskins.
Directed by Atom Egoyan (PG-13, 116 minutes). In the brilliantly
realized surreal thriller, adapted from William Trevor's popular
novel, Felicia (Ms. Cassidy), a pregnant Irish girl searching for
her boyfriend in the English midlands, is befriended by Joseph
Hildritch (Hoskins), a catering manager who also happens to be a
serial killer. Egoyan, Canada's most gifted filmmaker, elevates
this cat-and-mouse game into a film that transcends genre by
entering the characters' consciousness and implying a world of
half-discernible connections in which the weather, the landscape
and the chance encounters of strangers suggest the sense of a grand
design (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `FLAWLESS,' starring Robert De Niro and Philip Seymour Hoffman.
Written and directed by Joel Schumacher (R, 110 minutes). De Niro
is a retired New York City policeman recovering from a stroke and
Hoffman the drag queen upstairs who gives him speech therapy in the
form of singing lessons in this stridently campy comedy. Their
flashy performances can't add dimension to a movie that is a
message-laden duet for two caricatures, a homophobe and the angry,
self-loathing drag queen who gets him out of his depression
(Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `THE INSIDER,' starring Al Pacino, Russell Crowe and Christopher
Plummer. Directed by Michael Mann (R, 155 minutes). Mann directs
this taut thriller about the tobacco industry whistle-blower
Jeffrey Wigand with pulse-quickening panache. And he illustrates
why, in the corporate climate of the '90s, truth-telling is a
riskier business than it was circa ``All the President's Men.''
While Pacino delivers galvanizing moral outrage as a producer for
``60 Minutes,'' and Plummer wickedly mimics Mike Wallace, Crowe
movingly captures the complexity of Wigand's situation. Shaky
docudrama ethics cloud the film's take on ``60 Minutes.'' But this
is an inordinately well-played thriller, with Mann's stylistic brio
at its best (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `LIBERTY HEIGHTS,' starring Adrien Brody, Bebe Neuwirth, Joe
Mantegna and Ben Foster. Directed and written by Barry Levinson (R,
134 minutes). This semi-autobiographical comedy-drama remembering
teen-age life, anti-Semitism and racism in mid-1950s Baltimore is
the fourth movie by Levinson to be set in his native city. A deeply
felt nostalgia trip, the movie adrgitly aaptures the look and
social attitudes of the city 45 years ago. But the screenplay and
performances are too muted for the movie to come to terms with
growing pains cushioned in the nostalgic haze (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `MANSFIELD PARK,' starring Frances O'Connor and Jonny Lee
Miller. Written and directed by Patricia Rozema (PG-13, 105
minutes). In Ms. Rozema's skillful screen adaptation of Jane
Austen's third novel, the protagonist Fanny Price (Ms. O'Connor)
has been sharpened into a proto-feminist heroine who triumphs over
the materialist, patriarchal values of her wealthy relatives
through a combination of wit, beauty and daring. Without bearing
down too heavily, the screenplay (which incorporates fragments of
Austen's letters and diaries) equates early 19th-century
slave-trading with the oppression of women. The message is leavened
with smart humor and warm three-dimensional performances (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `THE MESSENGER: THE STORY OF JOAN OF ARC,' starring Milla
Jovovich, John Malkovich, Tcheky Karyo and Faye Dunaway. Directed
by Luc Besson (R, 130 minutes). The Hundred Years' War feels twice
that long in this shrill, frenetic account of Joan of Arc. It's a
film whose main revelation is that the Middle Ages may have been a
lot more lurid than previously reported. Besson directs plenty of
grisly, hand-held battle scenes and absurd scenes of royal
scheming, while Ms. Jovovich talks. Like this. And doesn't seem
faintly plausible as France's teen-age martyr. Here's a case where
``Don't shoot `The Messenger''' would have been sound advice
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `MUSIC OF THE HEART,' starring Meryl Streep, Aidan Quinn, Angela
Bassett and Gloria Estefan. Directed by Wes Craven (PG, 110
minutes). Not many of us enjoy being lectured by dressed-down
Hollywood stars in gritty classroom situations. But the true story
of Roberta Guaspari, a music teacher in East Harlem and a single
mother surviving a nasty divorce, has been given a blunt,
no-nonsense tone that works. Ms. Streep gives a down-to-earth
performance that is sheer award bait. The story is inspirational
enough to take Ms. Guaspari from no job prospects to watching her
proud students play alongside Itzhak Perlman, Isaac Stern and other
violin stars. Not a bad reason for Craven to have sidelined the
claws and hatchets for a while (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `POKEMON: THE FIRST MOVIE,' with the voices of Veronica Taylor,
Philip Bartlett, Rachael Lillis, Eric Stuart, Addie Blaustein and
Ikue Otani. Directed by Kunihiko Yuyama (G, 90 minutes). Parents
don't have to know all 151 monsters to understand ``Pokemon: The
First Movie,'' but they can observe several in action, including
Pikachu, cutest of them all. The magic doesn't bridge the
generation gap; whatever makes ``Pokemon'' such a huge pop-culture
phenomenon is still a secret of the grammar school set, but the
film is energetic and the animation is fun to watch. The plot is
about a bioengineered Pokemon who lures young Pokemon trainers
(including 12-year-old Ash of the television series) into a
showdown. Characters spout pacifist profundities while pairs of
monsters punch each other silly (Anita Gates).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `PRINCESS MONONOKE,' with the voices of Billy Crudup, Claire
Danes, Billy Bob Thornton and Minnie Driver. Directed by Hayao
Miyazaki (PG-13, 133 minutes). A landmark feat of Japanese
animation from the acknowledged master of the genre. This
complicated, exotically beautiful epic features gods and demons
locked in battle for the future of the forest, and its visions are
breathtakingly rendered. But it is the film's stirring use of
nature, myth and Japanese history that makes it so special. Worth
seeing just for its Forest Spirit, which takes animal form by day
and roams the night as a diaphanous, Godzilla-like divinity. The
image of plants and flowers springing to life beneath his hooves is
ravishingly presented. Despite a superb blend of hand-drawn cels
and fluid, computer-generated animation, the film's look is
gratifyingly understated (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `RIDE WITH THE DEVIL,' starrang Skeet Ulrich, Tobey Maguire and
Jewel. Directed by Ang Lee (R, 134 minutes). This contemplative
Civil War epic, instead of concentrating on the major battles,
looks at the outskirts of the conflict _ the Kansas-Missouri border
_ where Confederate and Union guerrillas raid each other's
outposts. The dramatic high point is a re-creation of Quantrill's
Raid, in which a Confederate force swooped down on Lawrence, Kan.,
massacring 150 people. Maguire and Ulrich are childhood friends on
the Confederate side, and the pop star Jewel (in her movie debut)
is a young widow they both love. Even cooler in tone than ``The Ice
Storm,'' the movie is visually stunning and historically
provocative but dramatically flat (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `ROSETTA,' starring Emilie Dequenne. Directed by Luc and
Jean-Pierre Dardenne (R, 90 minutes). This grim quasi-documentary,
filmed with hand-held cameras (it's almost as jiggly as ``The Blair
Witch Project''), picked up the Palme d'Or (the top prize) at the
Cannes Film Festival earlier this year. Ms. Dequenne was also
chosen best actress for her portrayal of a miserable 17-year-old
Belgian girl living in a trailer camp with her alcoholic mother.
Her desperate quest for a job and what she calls a ``normal life''
leads her to betray her only friend, who works in a waffle stand,
by stealing his job. Unlike the Dardenne brothers' last film, ``La
Promesse,'' the movie's social realist angst feels contrived, and
its main character never fully comes to life (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `SLEEPY HOLLOW,' starring Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Miranda
Richardson, Michael Gambon, Jeffrey Jones, Michael Gough and
Christopher Walken. Written by Andrew Kevin Walker and directed by
Tim Burton (R, 110 minutes). This ornate visual fantasy, artfully
concocted using a palette that suggests nuclear winter, has little
to do with Washington Irving's story and everything to do with
Burton's macabre vision. Depp makes a dashing hero as the film's
shy detective, but the story (by the writer of ``Seven'' and
``Fight Club'') is determined to put the ick into Ichabod Crane. A
first-rate cast and extraordinary technical talents are
attention-getting here, but so is the film's penchant for sardonic
beheadings. It's possible to admire Burton immensely, for the
secret tenderness and rich imagination of his work, without wanting
to peer at the exposed brain stems of his characters (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE STRAIGHT STORY,' starring Richard Farnsworth and Sissy
Spacek. Directed by David Lynch (G, 110 minutes). As the least
likely filmmaker on the planet to pull off a G-rated miracle, Lynch
rises to the challenge with exhilarating vigor. It may not sound
like much, but this account of an old man making a long trip on a
riding lawn mower turns out to be a slow-moving, folksy-looking,
deeply spiritual film with the power to hold audiences in thrall.
And as Oscar may well note next spring, it would not have been
possible without Farnsworth's terse, no-nonsense honesty at its
heart. Lynch's famously unwholesome imagination crosses a new
frontier to explore simple virtues and natural beauty. The result:
a supremely improbable triumph (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `TUMBLEWEEDS,' starring Janet McTeer and Kimberly Brown.
Directed by Gavin O'Connor (PG-13, 100 minutes). An astoundingly
vital performance by the British actress Janet McTeer makes this
small, beautifully acted slice of contemporary Americana a must-see
film. Ms. McTeer is Mary Jo Walker, a sexy, free-spirited woman
with four marriages behind her who travels across the country with
her 12-year-old daughter, Ava (Ms. Brown). Like few other films,
this one captures an intimately loving (though not conflict-free)
relationship between a parent and child without becoming
saccharine. The director plays Mary Jo's trucker boyfriend, who is
only the latest in a series of her romantic disasters (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH,' starring Pierce Brosnan, Sophie
Marceau, Dame Judi Dench, Robert Carlyle and Denise Richards.
Directed by Michael Apted (PG-13, 128 minutes). This director is
much admired for his ``Up'' series chronicling the lives of former
schoolchildren as they mature. And he has managed to make James
Bond grow up a little, too. Brosnan has grown much more comfortable
with the role of Bond, and most of the other characters are also
more interesting than might have been expected. Ms. Marceau slinks
memorably through the role of a treacherous oil heiress. Ms.
Richards seemed a lot smarter playing high school vixens than she
does as a brilliant scientist here. The itinerary roams from
Scotland to Central Asia. And Apted handles the action as well as
he does the talk (Maslin).

   man walked up to you and claimed God had spoken to him in the
woods, you would probably shuffle away quickly before he handed you
a pamphlet.
</P>
<P>
   But when Joseph Smith made that claim in 1820, many people
called him a prophet. Many still do _ as membership in the Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has risen to more than 10
million people in 160 countries.
</P>
<P>
   But it all started with a 14-year-old boy caught up in the
religious fervor sweeping early 19th-century America and wondering
which church he should join. Any Mormon knows the rest of the
story; anyone who watches ``American Prophet: The Story of Joseph
Smith'' will learn the bulk of it as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a story of faith and belief,'' Lee Groberg, who
directed the film, said from his home in Bountiful, Utah. ``I think
the LDS viewer will come away with a greater respect and a deeper
conviction of their own beliefs. The non-LDS (viewer) will simply
look at it and have a respect for the story. I don't know that it's
meant to sway anyone to call 1-800 and call your missionary.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor should it. ``American Prophet'' airs on public television,
after all. You're much more likely to be converted to the Mormon
faith by a nice young man in a white shirt and tie on a bicycle
than you are from watching this. It's doubtful non-believers would
sit through two hours of proselytizing anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Groberg, himself a Mormon, set out to document Smith the man,
not the Mormon faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he stands on his own,'' Groberg said. ``There were a
lot of prophets who came and went. There were a lot of religions
that started and died. His remained. I think that is a significant
piece of the story: What caused it to prosper?''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, according to ``American Prophet,'' the answer is Smith,
through his perseverance, personality and good, old-fashioned hard
work.
</P>
<P>
   But this was a man who stirred people up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a radical preacher of extreme ideas,'' Nathan O. Hatch,
provost of the University of Notre Dame, says in the film. And,
indeed, Groberg doesn't shy away from laying at Smith's feet some
of the responsibility for the extreme reactions of believers and
non-believers.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the religious scholars point out, there are things that
Joseph Smith did and that the early Mormons did in their
zealousness that caused some of their own problems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To someone outside the church, some of Smith's claims and
revelations sound a little odd and not just today. When someone
says an angel told him where to find plates of gold to translate,
it's going to raise some eyebrows, no matter what century you're
living in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other people could point to scripture,'' Richard T. Hughes, a
historian, says in the film. ``Or they can point to their
interpretation of scripture. . . . Joseph said, `I spoke with God.
God spoke with me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The early church was something of a moving target as well, with
Smith changing its tenets often enough to frustrate even some of
his closest friends and followers.
</P>
<P>
   But to outsiders, Smith and his new church posed even bigger
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joseph breached one of the sacred lines in American political
culture of his time,'' historian Richard Lyman Bushman says in the
film. ``He joined the powers of church and state. He claimed to be
a prophet, to speak from God, to command men's consciences, their
understanding of the world. And at the same time, he liberally
accepted offices of mayor, leader of his city.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Americans, that combination of religious and political
power was just explosive. They could not abide it.''
</P>
<P>
   Being a Mormon, Groberg was, of course, familiar with Smith.
That familiarity meant a rethinking of how to tell his story so
that no assumed knowledge seeped in.
</P>
<P>
   ``For instance, as we shared the first draft of the script with
PBS for review, they sent back a number of comments,'' Groberg
said. ``PBS wrote back and said, `What happened to the golden
plates that you talk about in the show? Do you have them in a
museum? Are we going to see them in the show? We had to go back and
resolve that. We had to keep catching ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   (Note to non-Mormons: According to church history, the angel
Moroni retrieved them, so don't expect to see them in the film.)
</P>
<P>
   The film is curiously paced, with much time spent on Smith's
early days. But the section dealing with the end of his life seems
rushed. And while Groberg's intent to separate the man from the
religion is noble, at times they're too separate, leaving the
non-Mormon without the context he needs to understand Smith's
influence.
</P>
<P>
   But ``American Prophet'' does go a long way toward satisfying
one of PBS' goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``In their words, they said many people know something about
(Smith) or have heard of him,'' Groberg said. ``But nobody knows
anything about him really.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who watch, ``American Prophet'' will change that. &QL;

CRUNCH (Phoenix) - Thanksgiving and Christmas/Hanukkah are close
together this year, and there's a push on for bigger expenditures
this New Year's, with the millennium. More and bigger holiday
parties. The regular stress and outlay of cash at this season are
even worse. We talk to folks and get some advice from experts on
how to handle the finances, so we're not paying for the season well
into the next millennium. BY KERRY FEHR-SNYDER. Story will move in
the ``F'' and ``L'' categories. &QL; 
 &QL; 
APPEALS (Phoenix) - A ``plain error of fact'' committed by the U.S.
Supreme Court and compounded by a lower court has thrown the
handling of criminal appeals into chaos in Arizona and must be
corrected quickly, the state's top prosecutor contends. In a
request this month for a rare review by all 21 active judges of the
Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco, the state
Attorney General's Office is trying to undo a pair of decisions
that allow most criminal appeals either to bypass the state's
highest court altogether or to be filed in both state and federal
court, doubling the workload. By JON KAMMAN. Story will move in the

   (Phoenix) - Today, if a young man walked up to you and claimed
God had spoken to him in the woods, you would probably shuffle away
quickly before he handed you a pamphlet. But when Joseph Smith made
that claim in 1820, many people called him a prophet. Many still
do, as membership in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints has risen to more than 10 million people in 160 countries.

   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ You can't say it about many cities, but you
can certainly say it about this one: One man changed its destiny.
</P>
<P>
   His name is Joseph P. Riley Jr. He is Charleston's mayor. He
halted its long decline, which lasted for a hundred years after the
Civil War, turning it from a proud but rotting relic into a model
modern city. After 24 years on the job, in an era of pervasive
skepticism about politicians, he was elected to a seventh term on
Nov. 9 with 71 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Even the cynical cabbies believe in him. One old-timer told me,
``I'd bet my life that he's never stolen a nickel or cheated a
soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley has had help, of course: from a business community
galvanized into action when the 95-year-old Charleston Naval Base
was closed in 1996; from a devoted band of preservationists
determined to restore the beauties of antebellum Charleston; from
an unconventional police chief, Reuben Greenberg, a black Jew with
two degrees from Berkeley whose Deep South brand of tough love has
slashed the crime rate and forged better race relations; and from
Gian Carlo Menotti, who rejuvenated the city's cultural life when
he established an American version of his Spoleto festival here.
</P>
<P>
   Riley has also been helped by history. Charleston is steeped in
it, and tourists flock here to trace its footprints in the
jasmine-scented streets and aristocratic houses. They admire the
porches, called piazzas, positioned to catch ocean breezes, and the
Mediterranean interplay of light, sea and shade, and the narrow
gardens, full of boxwood, old roses and neat brick paths. A few may
recall the watchwords of the beloved Emily Whaley, whose
blossom-filled plot at 58 Church St. measures only 30 feet by 100
feet: ``Early to bed, early to rise, work like hell and
fertilize.''
</P>
<P>
   They visit the ruined Fort Sumter, toward which Confederate
gunners under the grandiloquently named Gen. Pierre Gustave Toutant
Beauregard directed the first shots of the Civil War on April 12,
1861. They sit in the box pews at St. Michael's Episcopal Church,
finished in 1761, where George Washington and Robert E. Lee both
came to pray. Its noble white steeple, a near replica of the one at
St. Martin's-in-the-Fields in London, may well have been designed
by the same architect, James Gibbs. They stroll past the Italianate
and Greek Revival mansions of the rice planters along the Battery,
the tourists do, and gaze out upon the point where, as the natives
like to say, the Ashley River meets the Cooper to form the Atlantic
Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   While they are here, the visitors account for a third of
Charleston's economy. There is money in those old buildings, which
Charleston was once ``too poor to paint, too proud to whitewash,''
and in those oh-so-courtly Southern ways, which year after year win
Charleston the No. 1 position on a list of Most Mannerly Cities in
America compiled by Marjabelle Young Stewart, an etiquette expert.
</P>
<P>
   Wiser travelers come in spring and fall, for Spoleto and the
house and garden tours, avoiding the long, suffocating days of
summer. But Charleston seldom seems crowded or hurried, regardless
of season.
</P>
<P>
   Life ambles along with all the speed and urgency of a drawl.
This is a small city, centered on a narrow peninsula, with only
75,000 people, though the metropolitan area is several times that.
</P>
<P>
   The scale is human. The streets are clean, free of graffiti and
litter. You can stroll down Ropemaker's Lane or Price's Alley,
leaving the 20th century far behind, yet this is a real city, not a
museum like Williamsburg.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose that at this point I should declare an interest, as
British politicians say. My wife's maiden name was Betsey Pinckney,
and she comes from the storied clan that more or less invented
Charleston. Two of her forebears signed the Constitution; one of
them, Charles Pinckney, later served as minister to Spain; the
other, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, was named envoy to France and
ran unsuccessfully as the Federalist nominee for president (twice)
and vice president. Charles Cotesworth's brother, Thomas, served as
minister to England. All three fought in the Revolutionary War.
</P>
<P>
   The 18th-century Low Country elite was ``a vast cousinage,'' one
prominent historian has written, a hugely prosperous extended
family. In 1774 the per capita wealth of Charleston and the Low
Country was four times that of the Virginia plantations, six times
that of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   They say that Charlestonians are like the Japanese, in that they
eat rice and worship their ancestors. The Pinckney-tude of
Charleston can be a bit much. There are a Pinckney Street, Pinckney
Island and Castle Pinckney, and the graveyards are full of
Pinckneys. Betsey once rode in a carriage pulled by a horse named
Charles Cotesworth Pinckney.
</P>
<P>
   But Eliza Lucas Pinckney won me over. Born in Antigua, the
daughter of a colonial governor, she married the first Charles
Pinckney in 1744. In short order she bore three children (including
Charles Cotesworth and Thomas), compiled one of the very first
colonial recipe books and took over the management of several large
plantations, where she taught many slaves to read and write. Most
important, she introduced the cultivation of indigo to the state.
It was a crop so valuable to the British textile industry for dyes
that it made South Carolina a favored child of the mother country.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the early settlers, the Pinckneys came from England
by way of Barbados. Others came directly from Britain and France.
These last were almost all Huguenots, or French Calvinists, and
their tradition lives on in Charleston names like Manigault and
Huger (pronounced you-GEE).
</P>
<P>
   The piazza, which on many houses functions as an outdoor room,
is an adaptation of a Barbadian architectural style; in this
particular form, it is found only in Charleston. St. James', an
Episcopal church that also draws on West Indian traditions,
survives in the northern suburb of Goose Creek, all but hidden in a
copse of trees. The pale pink stucco building, without a steeple,
has a dozen fine Palladian windows and, in a pediment over the main
door, a relief of a pelican nourishing its young, the symbol of the
missionary Society for the Propagation of the Gospel.
</P>
<P>
   Built about 1713, set in a walled graveyard overhung with live
oaks, the church still displays George I's coat of arms behind the
pulpit.
</P>
<P>
   The planters who lived around Goose Creek and along the Low
Country rivers maintained ties to Britain for generations. In 1715
Palladio's treatise on classical styles was first published in
England, and 30 years later John Drayton built a porticoed
plantation house on the Ashley whose Tuscan and Ionic columns come
directly from Palladio's pages.
</P>
<P>
   Drayton Hall stands alone among the great houses in its
neighborhood. It was spared by Sherman's soldiers because, it is
said, the owner had his slaves tell the federal troops that the
house was being used as a smallpox hospital. Never converted to
central heating or electric lights, and painted only twice, the
interior of the house retains its elaborate architectural details
and elegant plaster moldings and ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   Boone Hall, with a famous half-mile allee of live oaks planted
in 1743, is a 1935 re-creation of the original. Cypress Gardens and
Magnolia Gardens, both laid out amid blackwater swamps, are set
alight by a riot of camellias and azaleas every spring. Medway
Plantation, on the Cooper, was built in 1705 and is probably the
oldest brick building in the state. It is privately owned and open
only for the garden tours.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Middleton Place that always lures us out of the city
on fine days. Its manor house is a ruin; only one small flanking
building survives, and it has been much altered. Never mind. It is
filled with family portraits by Benjamin West, valuable silver,
18th-century beds with posts carved to resemble rice stalks and
other furniture from the workshop of Thomas Elfe, Charleston's most
noted cabinetmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Bookshelves and tables hold rare first editions by Catesby and
Audubon, who came here to draw the ospreys and egrets that still
nest in local marshes. Audubon formed a friendship with Joel
Poinsett, an erudite Charleston-born diplomat, who brought the
Christmas plant named for him to this country from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Middleton began to plot his classical gardens in 1741.
They are anchored by a pair of lakes shaped like a butterfly's open
wings, which lie just below a series of scalloped terraces. On
another part of the plantation a flock of sheep grazes. A pathway
leads beneath arching camellia bushes that carpet it in pink in
early March. Everywhere there are stupendous trees _ gums,
magnolias, crape myrtles _ and a mighty oak, a marker on an Indian
trail before Columbus reached America, has a circumference of 30
feet and a spread of 145.
</P>
<P>
   It took 100 slaves 10 years to lay out the terraces, the canals
and the rest of the rigorously geometric design. To my mind they
created the greatest garden that we have from Colonial America.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Slavery and its legacy, white supremacy, hung over Charleston
like a pall for generations.
</P>
<P>
   The French author Simone de Beauvoir came here in 1947. She was
bewitched by the place, especially the Spanish moss, exulting in
her journal that ``it is the color of smoke, the color of amber and
twilight.'' But the plantations haunted her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Creating those private Edens, which are as extravagant as the
Alhambra,'' she wrote a few pages later, ``required the vast wealth
of planters and the hell of slavery; the delicate petals of the
azaleas and camellias are stained with blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 1700 and 1775, the peak years of the slave trade, 40
percent of the Africans brought to America in chains passed through
Charleston. Ever since, blacks have formed a big portion of the
city's population.
</P>
<P>
   DuBose Heyward's 1925 novel, ``Porgy,'' transformed by George
Gershwin into the folk opera ``Porgy and Bess'' in 1935, portrayed
the lives of some of the poorest of them, who lived on Church
Street in the onetime slave dependencies of houses on Cabbage Row,
or Catfish Row, as Heyward renamed it. The city's blacks gave
another gift to Broadway, the kinetic dock workers' dance that was
transformed into the Charleston for ``Runnin' Wild,'' a 1923 hit.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, Charleston has moved well beyond its bleak days, and in
casting off the shroud of white supremacy it has gradually begun to
remember and to acknowledge the black role in its history. The
other half of the story is displayed for visitors in the slave
quarters at Boone Hall and the Aiken-Rhett House downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The College of Charleston's Avery Research Center delves into
the African-American past, maintaining collections of manuscripts
and papers, including the records of the 54th Massachusetts
Regiment, the black unit that mounted the heroic assault on Fort
Wagner depicted in the Civil War film ``Glory.'' That battle, in
which the 54th's commander, Robert Gould Shaw, lost his life, is
fully described at the wonderful Charleston Museum.
</P>
<P>
   But the process is just beginning. Important moments of black
history remain submerged. The plaque at the Emanuel African
Methodist Episcopal Church on Calhoun Street says simply, ``Founded
1818, closed 1822, reopened 1865.'' What lurks behind that simple
word ``closed''! The church was closed because it had been burned
down by a white mob in revenge for the actions of Denmark Vesey, a
parishioner who tried to foment a slave uprising.
</P>
<P>
   Riley told me that economic opportunity had provided the key to
the dramatic improvement in relations between the races in his
city.
</P>
<P>
   ``You make the table bigger,'' he said when we met in his
office, which was piled high with files, newspapers and official
documents. ``You don't tell some people that they have to leave.
We've made progress in housing, in police work, in guaranteeing the
full participation of all our citizens in the affairs of the city
council. But you can never relax. In a diverse society, there are
always a lot of opportunities for misunderstanding, so you have to
be sure that new bridges are built and old ones are maintained.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley has pioneered ``scatter-site'' public housing in an effort
to combat the ghetto mentality. He has passed ordinances banning
T-shirt shops, neon and tour buses in the historic district and
hotels on the waterfront, lest the very element that brings
visitors to Charleston, its charm, be submerged in tourist
tattiness. He has built things that appeal to locals and visitors,
rich and poor, like a brand-new Waterfront Park, which helped to
revive a crumbling old port district, and a new minor-league
ballpark. On King Street an old movie theater has been turned into
a convention hall, a new Saks Fifth Avenue has opened and a bank
now houses a Starbucks.
</P>
<P>
   What sets Riley apart from run-of-the-mill mayors is a genuine
passion for his work. He is _ dare we use the word in this cynical
era? _ a true visionary, and it is his vision of a city reborn that
has carried him and Charleston through nightmares like Hurricane
Hugo in 1989, which damaged 90 percent of the city's roofs and made
a shambles of businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The closing of the naval base, Riley said soon after it
happened, ``was like death, because no one had ever imagined life
in Charleston without the Navy.'' The city's longtime congressman,
Mendel Rivers, had poured Pentagon dollars into the city for
decades; his slogan was, ``Rivers Delivers.'' But the city not only
survived the blow, it surged rapidly ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're way on the plus side by now,'' said Ben Cole, the
president of the Charleston Regional Development Alliance. ``We
lost about 22,500 jobs when the Navy left. Since then we've gained
around 35,000 new ones.''
</P>
<P>
   The alliance, founded in February 1995, brought capital
investments of more than $1.75 billion to the area in its first
three years of existence, and it has kept up that pace. Ninety new
companies have arrived, a third of them foreign, lured by the
climate, the mostly nonunion labor force and above all the booming
port.
</P>
<P>
   Charleston, quaint little Charleston, is now the largest
container port in the South and second only to New York on the east
coast. There are plans afoot to make it much bigger by building
port installations on Daniel Island, northeast of the city, but
that worries conservationists.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile the restoration of old Charleston continues apace. At
the moment scaffolding obscures the Market Hall, a little Doric
temple that stands at the head of the city's public market, and the
Fireproof Building, designed in 1826 by Robert Mills as a county
records office. A draftsman for Thomas Jefferson at Monticello,
Mills became South Carolina's greatest architect, building
courthouses and churches, including the First Baptist on Church
Street in Charleston, in a severe Classical Revival style. He later
designed the Treasury and the Washington Monument in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   A favorite of mine in the same style, though not by Mills, is
the Hibernian Hall on Meeting Street, a chaste white structure with
a gilded harp above the door, across from the Fireproof Building.
It was designed by Thomas U. Walter, who also went on to greater
architectural glory in Washington, designing the dome of the
Capitol. Since the years after the Civil War the hall has been the
site, on the third Thursday in January, of the annual St. Cecilia
Ball, Charleston's oldest, most exclusive social function.
</P>
<P>
   When they say ``exclusive'' in Charleston, they mean it. The
right to attend is inherited. A favorite local put-down, Betsey's
cousin Jane Hanahan told us, is to say of someone, ``He doesn't go
to the ball.'' To which Betsey's irreverent brother, Tom, replied,
``It's the only thing left, now that the House of Lords is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Portraits of the ancestors of today's ballgoers can be seen at
the Gibbes Museum of Art, whose collection includes important works
by Samuel F.B. Morse, Gilbert Stuart and Thomas Sully. The gem of
the collection is an unforgettable image of John C. Calhoun, the
ardent champion of states' rights, by Rembrandt Peale.
</P>
<P>
   But the real monuments to the men and women who built Charleston
are their houses, no fewer than 3,500 of them built before 1860.
Two that should not be missed are the Nathaniel Russell House, with
an oval staircase that vaults upward with no visible means of
support, and the Heyward-Washington House, whose pine floors and
cypress paneling date from 1772. Its unmatched collection of
Charleston furniture includes a chest-on-chest-on-chest, one of
only three in existence.
</P>
<P>
   When you have had your fill of houses, there are plays at the
Dock Street Theater, where the Charleston Stage Company presents
120 performances a year, and at the Footlight Players' intimate
240-seat house. The Charleston Symphony, for which Riley dreams of
building a proper hall, has attracted soloists of the caliber of
Itzhak Perlman and Sherrill Milnes.
</P>
<P>
   But it is at festival time that the city comes culturally alive.
Next year's Spoleto Festival, accompanied by its ``fringe,'' known
as Piccolo Spoletto, is scheduled for May 26 through June 11.
</P>
<P>
   In late September comes the Mojo Arts Festival, a celebration of
African-American and Caribbean art, with a rich array of jazz,
gospel and storytelling. Another part of Charleston's enthusiastic
rediscovery of itself.

</P>
<P>
   Here is a sampling of attractions, along with travel
information:
</P>
<P>
   WHERE TO STAY:
</P>
<P>
   Charleston Place, 130 Market St., (843) 724-8410. With a prime
location, two top-flight restaurants and an indoor-outdoor rooftop
pool, this 450-room sister ship of Venice's Cipriani easily tops
the roster of Charleston hotels. The bustling lobby, dominated by a
huge white Murano chandelier, is the city's crossroads. But too
many little things misfire: front-desk phones go unanswered after
25 rings, for example, and bathroom lights are placed so the
makeup-applier's or shaver's face is cast into shadow. Double room:
$175 to $395.
</P>
<P>
   Planters Inn, 112 N. Market St., (843) 722-2345. Nothing is more
characteristic of Charleston than the piazza or veranda overlooking
a brick-paved, palmetto-shaded courtyard. The Planters Inn has
both, plus high-ceilinged rooms, many with four-poster beds, and a
warmly welcoming attitude at the reception desk. The inn belongs to
the well-regarded Relais &AMP; Chateaux group, and it offers all the
modern electronic paraphernalia. Double room: $175 to $225.
</P>
<P>
   Wentworth Mansion, 149 Wentworth St., (843) 853-1886. It was
built by a cotton merchant in the Gilded Age and looks it. Crystal
chandeliers, tile and marble floors, carved paneling and
Tiffany-style windows give the place an air of tasteful opulence.
Each of the 21 rooms has a CD player, a big-screen television, a
fireplace and lots of antiques; many have Jacuzzis, and the suites
are seignorial. Sweeping views from the rooftop cupola. Double
room: $275 and $375.
</P>
<P>
   Harbour View Inn, 2 Vendue Range, (843) 853-8439. Despite the
mock-English spelling of its name, the Harbour View really does
have harbor views. Only 15 months old, it is just across the street
from the arching fountains of Charleston's handsome new Waterfront
Park. And the agreeably furnished rooms (52 of them) are rather
gently priced. Double room: $129 weekdays; $179 weekends.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE TO EAT:
</P>
<P>
   Hominy Grill, 207 Rutledge Ave., (843) 937-0930, is as
unpretentious as they come _ a former barbershop with clapboard
walls and butcher paper on the tables _ but everyone in town knows
how good and how fairly priced it is. One day not long ago, two
pickups and a Rolls-Royce were parked outside. Try shrimp and grits
or toasted banana bread for brunch, a pimento cheese sandwich with
arugula (!) for lunch, Southern fried chicken with spiced peach
sauce for dinner. Robert Stehling, the chef, earned his stripes in
Chapel Hill, N.C., from Bill Neal, a culinary legend in the New
South.
</P>
<P>
   Louis', 200 Meeting St., (843) 853-2550. Some people like Adam
Tihany's hip decor and some don't (this is Charleston, after all),
but nobody doesn't like Louis Osteen, a sweet-natured country boy
with a golden touch at the stove. He blends Europe with the South
in black-eyed pea cassoulet and sweetbreads braised with Madeira,
Vidalia onions and country ham. Other dishes speak pure Carolina,
like oyster stew with benne (sesame) seeds and pork porterhouse
with corn bread dressing. It is all meltingly delicious, and Mrs.
Osteen, Marlene, has chosen 350 pedigreed wines to go with it.
</P>
<P>
   Magnolias, 185 East Bay, (843) 577-7771. Magnolias is always
packed. With good reason; Donald Barickman, the clever chef,
produces a host of crowd-pleasers like Down South egg rolls,
stuffed with chicken, collard greens and spicy tasso ham, and fried
green tomato BLTs. Bright paintings, ancient pine floors and a mix
of locals and tourists enhance the casual mood.
</P>
<P>
   Peninsula Grill, in the Planters Inn (see above), (843)
723-0700. A cosmopolitan, subtly lighted room with velvet walls,
the grill delighted me with foie gras served with duck rillettes
and peach jam, and a veal chop with cheesy, peppery grits. It let
Betsey down with over-the-hill oysters and overbreaded sweetbreads.
But the smiling service, the superb wines and the memorable
five-layer coconut cake more than tipped the balance.
</P>
<P>
   Slightly North of Broad, 192 East Bay Street, (843) 723-3424.
Like a lot of Charleston restaurants, SNOB, as it's known locally,
is a bit inconsistent. Saucing can be heavy-handed. But its mixed
grill of quail, homemade sausage and apple-smoked bacon over
cabbage is a winner.
</P>
<P>
   Woodlands, 125 Parsons Rd., Summerville, (843) 875-2600. Ken
Vedrinski produces the closest thing to haute cuisine in the Low
Country at this inn 30 minutes from Charleston. The regional accent
is muted, with turbotin and skate displacing shrimps and crab meat.
But don't go on Sunday: Woodlands serves a limited menu, and no
wine at all, on the sabbath.

`2 BY 4:' A YOUNG MAN IN SEARCH OF HIS SEXUAL IDENTITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The first scene of ``2 by 4'' is about black leather
pants. The second is about sexual orientation. Johnny Maher's
girlfriend asks him, ``Do you like men?'' He shrugs and answers,
``Try anything once, you know.'' Or twice. Or more.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny (Jimmy Smallhorne, who is also the film's director and
one of three writers) is a young Irishman, one of a large group who
have come to New York to make their fortunes, settled in the Bronx
and taken jobs in construction _ even if the newcomers don't know
one side of the wallboard from the other. In the evenings they
gather at their favorite pubs to sing and down a few pints, as
tradition would have it, or they go to someone's apartment to play
poker and snort cocaine, a less traditional combination. Johnny is
becoming interested in a different kind of night life, and he soon
meets Christian (Bradley Fitts), a young hustler with the face of
an angel and a need to be taken care of.
</P>
<P>
   For most of its 80 minutes, ``2 by 4'' seems to be the story of
one man's search for his true sexuality. Near the end, it becomes
something much narrower, and although this is an interesting and
adeptly made drama, its message is unclear. One of the final scenes
_ a lovely but scathing camera tour of a gay bar _ looks like an
exercise in self-loathing, the kind ``The Boys in the Band'' was
accused of 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers found themselves an A-list cinematographer,
Declan Quinn, whose work has included ``Leaving Las Vegas'' and
``Vanya on 42nd Street.'' Thanks to Quinn (who won the 1998
cinematography award for this film at the Sundance Film Festival),
the scenes of groups of construction workers riding through
Manhattan, gazing up at the skyline, make even those white brick
Eisenhower-era high-rise apartment buildings look good.
</P>
<P>
   The movie also has the benefit of the fine actor Chris O'Neill,
who died in 1997 after filming was completed. His character, who
has the unlikely name Trump, is Johnny's uncle, an eccentric older
man who is sort of the den father for all the boys from home. He's
the boss at the construction jobs, the coach of their weekend
sports teams, and he must own the bar because when he tells the
bartender, ``You're fired,'' the guy takes it as gospel and goes
home. Trump's business dealings may not all be of the highest
standard. In fact, the question of his moral character becomes an
important part of the plot, and he looks almost satanic at the end.
</P>
<P>
   The construction workers are a cursing bunch, and the
four-letter word that peppers their conversations most frequently
sounds almost charming, with a bit of a lilt, to American ears. The
love scenes, heterosexual and homosexual, contain partial nudity,
but more important, they're tender and realistic, unlike a number
of gay scenes that moviegoers may remember (in recent mainstream
movies with major stars).
</P>
<P>
   The oddest thing about ``2 by 4'' is that although it's in
English, it is subtitled. At first this seems ludicrous _ what,
American moveigoers can't cope with accents different from their
own? _ but after a while it's a relief not to have to listen so
intently. This way every word is clear, even if the plot's
conclusions aren't.

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ As Americans were celebrating their bounty in family
feasts from Ronkonkoma to Rancho Cucamonga on Thursday, a certain
very sizable goose was also about to be carved by those in the
business of making and selling motion-picture entertainment _ a
golden one.
</P>
<P>
   The four-day Thanksgiving weekend is not only one of the year's
busiest periods for family moviegoing, but it is also a launching
pad for the entire holiday movie season, a six-week period that
accounts for about 16 percent of Hollywood's annual ticket sales,
second only to the summer season in concentrated box-office energy.
</P>
<P>
   And most expect this year's Thanksgiving weekend to be
particularly lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, two major studio films were released nationally _
``Toy Story 2,'' the further computer-animated adventures of Woody
and Buzz Lightyear, and ``End of Days,'' an action film with a
millennium theme starring Arnold Schwarzenegger.
</P>
<P>
   This will also be the second weekend for ``The World Is Not
Enough,'' the new James Bond adventure, and ``Sleepy Hollow,'' a
Tim Burton horror-mystery, both of which earned over $30 million in
their opening weekends and were continuing to perform strongly
through the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a period of time this short, a lot of box office is made
during those weeks,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, chairman of
Exhibitor Relations, which monitors box-office performance. ``It is
a very key time to release a picture. And this year, we believe we
have a strong chance to have a record-breaking weekend, with total
box office of around $200 million, maybe even a bit more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Toy Story 2,'' which is widely expected to finish on top for
the weekend, should bring in more than $50 million alone,
Dergarabedian said. ``The box-office list is going to be real
top-heavy with those four films,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The record for Thanksgiving weekend, $182 million, was set last
year, driven by the release of ``A Bug's Life,'' ``Rugrats: The
Movie'' and ``Enemy of the State.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Viane, president of distribution for Disney, said that
``for movies, it's the best family holiday, the one weekend when
all families are together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a terrific launching pad,'' he continued. ``So many
films have opened near or on Thanksgiving and have gone on to be
blockbusters.''
</P>
<P>
   And a rather astonishing number of the recent ones have come
from Disney. Beginning in 1994, when the Tim Allen comedy ``The
Santa Clause'' came in first over the Thanksgiving holiday, Disney
has been in first place every year, with ``Toy Story'' in 1995
(edging out ``Goldeneye,'' another 007 movie), the live-action
``101 Dalmatians'' in 1996 (beating ``Star Trek: First Contact''),
``Flubber'' in 1997 (against ``Alien: Resurrection'') and ``A Bug's
Life'' last year. ``Toy Story 2'' is likely to make it six in a
row.
</P>
<P>
   As Dergarabedian put it, ```Toy Story' is kind of a can't-lose
proposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Life After Nora
</P>
<P>
   Janet McTeer wandered through the lounge, past the garden and
into the breakfast cafe at the Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills,
extraordinarily tall and poised, fresh from a morning swim to clear
out the jet-lag cobwebs left by a flight from London.
</P>
<P>
   Cast your mind back about three years, to when Ms. McTeer, an
accomplished British stage actress, rapidly became the toast of
Broadway for her Tony-winning turn as Nora in a highly praised
adaptation of ``A Doll's House.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McTeer, 37, remembers it as a heady but ultimately
exhausting time, exciting for the number of people who came
backstage to shower her with praise and flowers and for the
enthusiasm of the Broadway audiences, but draining for the demands
of the role, night after night. Many wondered during that play's
run what Ms. McTeer would do for an encore. The first thing she
did, she said, was take some time off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never been to New York before I did that play, never
lived there, and I found that I really liked it and thought, well,
why not stay around and see what happens,'' Ms. McTeer said. ``I
was offered one or two things immediately, but after doing Nora for
so long I decided I really didn't want to work any more that
year.''
</P>
<P>
   After a few months' rest, as 1997 turned into 1998, she also
found that a lot of the film roles she was being offered were not
as interesting as she had hoped. ``It might have been different if
I'd been a 22-year-old ingenue, but there you are,'' Ms. McTeer
said.
</P>
<P>
   So she moved back to London and played a series of roles, large
and small, in independent films of modest budget. Now the first of
them, ``Tumbleweeds,'' is being released in the United States, and
those who saw Ms. McTeer on the stage will not be surprised to
learn that it is causing her name to be mentioned as a possible
Oscar nominee.
</P>
<P>
   She plays Mary Jo Walker, a working-class woman from North
Carolina who drags her teen-age daughter on a cross-country flit
from bad relationship to bad relationship, finally trying to settle
down and sort out her life in a small seaside town in California.
The film, directed by Gavin O'Connor, is loosely based on the real
relationship between the screenwriter Angela Shelton and her
mother.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McTeer said she went to North Carolina last year to spend
some time with Ms. Shelton and her mother and to soak up the local
accent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had a good feeling about the script and about the
character,'' she said, ``and it gave me a chance to do something I
had never done before, which is always something you look for.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tumbleweeds'' opened in New York and Los Angeles on Wednesday
and will expand to more cities on Dec. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Ms. McTeer said, she will probably head back to London and
spend time around the house _ ``just in time for the worst weather
of the year, ridiculous timing'' _ while she begins searching for a
new play. She wants to return to the stage next year, preferably
with something new. After that, maybe more films, if something
catches her fancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, I just make it up as I go along,'' Ms. McTeer said.
``I mean, if something came along for a lot of money and it was
interesting, then yes, absolutely, like a shot. But otherwise, I'd
rather do stuff I like to do. I figure, as long as I can pay the
rent.''

</P>
<P>
   An Emotional Role
</P>
<P>
   Sigourney Weaver made her way through the lounge and into the
breakfast cafe at the Four Seasons Hotel in Toronto. Like Ms.
McTeer, she is tall and poised. For those keeping score, the two
actresses once appeared in the same film, ``Half Moon Street''
(1986), in which Ms. Weaver had top billing and Ms. McTeer was
listed 38th in the cast credits, playing ``Van Arkady's
Secretary,'' sandwiched between actors playing ``TV Newscaster''
and ``Second Lady.''
</P>
<P>
   Also like Ms. McTeer, Ms. Weaver is on the receiving end of some
whispers about a possible Oscar nomination, for the lead role in
``A Map of the World,'' an adaptation of Jane Hamilton's wrenching
family drama directed by Scott Elliott, the New York stage
director.
</P>
<P>
   When Elliott offered her the role of Alice Goodwin without even
meeting her, Ms. Weaver said, she was surprised and immediately
eager to do it. Only later did she begin to fret about the
emotional trek she would have to take during the filming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found I had a real resistance to going through all that I
needed to go through with Alice,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, though, she was helped by the rapid pace of
shooting necessitated by the film's relatively small budget. It
forced her through some of the difficult passages.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it was a tumble of events,'' Ms. Weaver said. ``You
hardly come up for air.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A Map of the World'' is a fairly dark story about a school
nurse who is, at least to some degree, responsible for the
accidental death of a friend's child. As if that were not enough,
she is also charged with sexually abusing a schoolchild and is
chucked into the local jail. The film is being released for one
week in New York and Los Angeles beginning on Dec. 3 to qualify for
the Academy Awards, with a wider release sometime early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Weaver said she visited Ms. Hamilton and a Wisconsin jail
near the Hamilton home, where she was allowed to spend time among
the prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   ``What struck me was the total lack of privacy,'' she said.
``There was no escape from the television. You were with these
people day and night. It was something.''
</P>
<P>
   It was certainly different from her other upcoming role, in the
big-budget comedy ``Galaxy Quest,'' in which she plays a somewhat
dim actress on a science-fiction show whom aliens mistake for a
real starship trooper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been waiting for years to be offered the role of the
mother,'' said Ms. Weaver, 50. ``For some reason, I never was.''

`EXECUTION OF JUSTICE': A PASSION FOR DOING RIGHT GOES HORRIBLY
WRONG 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you were gay in the late 1970s and happened to live in San
Francisco, the city (or at least the Castro) probably felt a lot
like Camelot. Only nine years after Stonewall, the Greenwich
Village uprising that gave birth to the gay rights movement, shame
had turned into pride and lurking into strutting. Laws were being
changed, as were attitudes, and you were at the center of it all.
That's beautifully clear in the scene of an exuberant gay parade in
``Execution of Justice,'' with Harvey Milk campaigning in a
convertible on a sunny day, accompanied by the sounds of the
Village People singing ``YMCA.''
</P>
<P>
   But we all know how real-life Camelots end. Milk, who became San
Francisco's first openly gay city supervisor, was assassinated,
along with Mayor George Moscone, in November 1978. They were shot
to death in their offices in the middle of the day by Dan White,
who until a few days before had been one of Milk's fellow
supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Execution of Justice,'' a Showtime film that has its premiere
on Sunday night, is the story of White, his trial and his tortured
psyche. The film doesn't solve the puzzle of what makes a man like
White commit such hideous acts, but it offers clues and
intelligent, effective drama.
</P>
<P>
   It would be interesting to know what method-acting associations,
if any, Tim Daly used to portray White. Daly, who has played much
sunnier roles (on the NBC comedy series ``Wings,'' for instance) in
the past, gives White a crazy, almost blank stare in all kinds of
situations, eyes that convey amorality in a frightening way; even
White's wife (Amy Van Nostrand) can sometimes see that.
</P>
<P>
   White's resume was straight-arrow all the way: former police
officer, former firefighter (and son of a firefighter), married
with children. Several scenes, though, reveal his volatile temper
and a twisted side. In one, he plays pool, drinks beer and
badmouths gay people (using several colorful epithets) with a
fellow firefighter. In another, he makes a speech against
``radicals, social deviants and incorrigibles.''
</P>
<P>
   In the most morally complex scene of all, set in a police
station, another police officer starts beating up a purse-snatcher.
While several other officers calmly watch and do nothing, White
stops the attack, demands that the guilty officer be punished and
quits his job in protest when he isn't. White's sense of doing
right (``I just wanted to do a good job for the city'') and the
belief that he is surrounded by immorality (``I've seen the city
going downhill'') sometimes had a basis in fact.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Coyote is also wonderful as Milk. Both he and Stephen
Young, who plays Moscone, display the easy charm and infectious
energy of successful, good-looking politicians, and even though the
two characters clearly have their faults, their deaths are felt as
a great loss.
</P>
<P>
   The film's standout, however, is Khalil Kain, in a small but
splashy role as Sister Boom Boom, a sassy transvestite in a nun's
habit with lavender trim who serves as a sort of Greek chorus for
the proceedings. In Emily Mann's 1986 Broadway play, on which the
film is based, Sister Boom Boom was played by Wesley Snipes. The
other notable account of the story is Robert Epstein's film ``The
Times of Harvey Milk,'' which won the 1984 Oscar as best
documentary.
</P>
<P>
   The final outrage was that White was found guilty only of
voluntary manslaughter and served less than six years. The
so-called Twinkie defense, which contended that White had
temporarily lost his mind from eating too much junk food, was only
part of the reason; having old friends on the force didn't hurt
either. White was released from prison in January 1985 and
committed suicide eight months later.

   `TOY STORY 2'
</P>
<P>
   With the voices of Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Joan Cusack, Kelsey
Grammer, Don Rickles, Jim Varney, Wallace Shawn, John Morris, Annie
Potts, John Ratzenberger &QL; 
Directed by John Lasseter.
</P>
<P>
   Rated G _ 92 minutes
</P>
<P>
   It's a busy morning in Andy's room, with the computer-animated
characters introduced four years ago in ``Toy Story'' hustling
around doing chores and noting postings of coming classes (``what
to do if part of you is swallowed''). But then disaster. About to
go off to day camp with Andy, Woody the cowhand gets one of his
shoulders ripped and is discarded on the top shelf. Next, Andy's
mom sweeps the room looking for old toys to put out for a yard
sale.
</P>
<P>
   After a dangerous mission to free their fellows about to be
bought, Woody and his friend the astronaut Buzz Lightyear grapple
with still another calamity. Woody is stolen by a fat toy dealer,
Big Al McWhiggin, who recognizes the cowpoke as the hero of an old
television show and wants to sell him and some other toy Westerners
to a museum in Japan. Trapped in Big Al's house, Woody meets the
others destined for display in a glass case: a cowgirl named Jessie
and a prospector, Stinky Pete, who hangs out in the box he was
packaged in.
</P>
<P>
   To spring Woody, Buzz rallies all the folk from Andy's room, a
gung-ho Buzz Lightyear knockoff and some hard-partying Barbie dolls
they run into in Big Al's superstore. But Pete and Jessie want
Woody to go to Japan with them because without him the deal is off
and they'll be put back in storage. Torn between old and new
friends, Woody ponders which way to turn.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE: Playthings get some rough treatment, both physical and
emotional, but nothing is too disturbing for too long.
</P>
<P>
   SEX: None.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY: None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-9: Strongly focused on standing by friends in times of
trouble, the film is also highly entertaining, which will delight
children all through this bracket, and is droll enough to engage
their parents, too, at least for as long as it needs to.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 10-11: By this age, a mixed reaction will set in, but most
viewers will enjoy themselves.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 12 AND UP: A rating milder than a PG-13 usually sounds the
evacuation, but perhaps not so loudly for a film that some
teen-agers will find more entertaining than they bargained for.
</P>
<P>
   `POKEMON: THE FIRST MOVIE'
</P>
<P>
   With the voices of Veronica Taylor, Philip Bartlett, Rachael
Lillis, Eric Stuart, Addie Blaustein, Ikue Otani
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Kunihiko Yuyama
</P>
<P>
   Rated G _ 90 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in another animated film that is undergoing multiple
viewings by many very small children and their flagging parents,
basic questions are posed about the ability of all creatures to get
along with their cloned likenesses.
</P>
<P>
   In a laboratory on New Island, evil scientists bioengineer
Mewtwo, a large, nasty flying cat who is about 10 times the size of
his model, Mew, the rarest of the 151 little monsters who
understand Pokemon. But Mewtwo, a clone who asks questions, demands
to know what his purpose is and, finding no good answer, finally
determines he has been made to rule the world. Chasing off the
scientists, the clone lures the best Pokemon monsters and trainers
to New Island for a showdown with all the cloned Pokemons he has
created.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he whips up a terrible storm, which threatens
all those at sea and on land. Staying true to their pacifistic
tendencies, the real Pokemon refuse to fight. Eventually the
message gets through to Mewtwo, who calls off the battle and calms
the waters.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE: There is much violence, both real and threatened, but
it is presented in ways that are not disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   SEX: None.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY: None.
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-12: Supposedly teaching children about responsibility,
teamwork and obedience, the Pokemon craze has taken firm hold
within this age band, but without the brand name the film makes
very ordinary kiddie fare.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   `THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH'
</P>
<P>
   Pierce Brosnan, Sophie Marceau, Robert Carlyle, Denise Richards,
Dame Judi Dench
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Michael Apted
</P>
<P>
   Rated PG-13 _ 128 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Apologies for the commotion but that rocket-assisted speedboat
passing through a couple of crowded restaurants needs to reconnect
with the water if it's to cut off the streaking craft driven by the
raven-haired assassin. Yes, it's James Bond ( Brosnan) again, along
with Q (Desmond Llewelyn), the weapons designer who devised the
Bond boat; Q's new assistant, R (John Cleese), and M (Dame Judi),
who passes out assignments to the agent numbered 007.
</P>
<P>
   This time Bond's task is to protect Elektra (Ms. Marceau) from
Renard ( Carlyle), a lugubrious terrorist with a droopy eye. In the
recent past, Renard kidnapped Elektra, the daughter of an oil
baron, in a celebrated case and now threatens humanity with schemes
no one is quite sure of but could involve unauthorized use of
nuclear materials. Unfazed by the threat and convinced that no man,
including Bond, can resist her, Elektra tends to her pipeline by
the Caspian Sea, which, if she plays her politics right, should all
but corner the oil flow from the former Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
   Renard's plans include a little bomb factory in the desert
staffed by Dr. Christmas Jones (Ms. Richards), a nuclear weapons
expert who looks good in shorts, has a sassy attitude and speaks
both Russian and MTV. Nevertheless, Elektra is the one to watch
here. Bond is captivated (up to a point), but then M is kidnapped
and Renard appears to have gained the upper hand in ways entirely
unanticipated.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE: Expect the usual Bondfire: explosions, sprays of
gunfire, knifings, stranglings, falls from high places, suffocation
in tight places and much hand-to-hand combat. But there is little
blood, let alone any sense of reality, and whatever the damage,
everybody quickly moves on.
</P>
<P>
   SEX: Bond, of course, goes to bed with almost every woman he
comes across. As with violence, however, sex is sanitized and
limited to decorative shots of pretty half-covered people lolling
about like mannequins. (And while product placement is inevitable,
one wishes there was at least something Bond could do without
flashing his wristwatch.)
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY: None.
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?
</P>
<P>
   UNDER AGE 10: Some parents will take small children to this
film, and while no one will emerge lastingly traumatized, maybe
``Toy Story 2'' or another round of ``Pokemon'' would be more
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 11 AND UP: Bond movies play old for many teen-agers, who
like their action harder, hipper and undandified. But for all the
violence and sex, the film is about the most harmless parents can
hope for from the genre.
</P>
<P>
   `SLEEPY HOLLOW'
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, Michael
Gambon, Christopher Walken, Casper Van Dien
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Tim Burton
</P>
<P>
   Rated R _ 110 minutes
</P>
<P>
   In Burton's darkly expressionistic reworking of the Washington
Irving story, Ichabod Crane (Depp), now a squeamish and rather
brainy investigator from New York City, is sent up the Hudson River
to the village of Sleepy Hollow, where select members of the shady
little citizenry have been getting their heads lopped off by, it is
said, a horseman who apparently was relieved of his own in the same
manner.
</P>
<P>
   Packing elaborate investigatory implements of his own invention,
young Crane no sooner pronounces that there could be no such thing
as a headless horseman than he is fleeing one at a full gallop. On
a great black steed, the headless fellow swings his sword with
precise efficiency, but he is mysteriously choosy about his
victims, who include women and children. In flashbacks to his
earlier existence, he has a head ( Walken's) and turns out to be a
Hessian soldier who lived and died by the sword during the
Revolutionary War 25 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the mercenary has returned from hell, but what he's
after and why remain unresolved. Steeling himself, Ichabod scraps
with the horseman occasionally and follows developments to a tree
of evil, stuffed with heads, from which the horseman emerges for
his murderous rides. Exposed neck stems are examined and a village
conspiracy is uncovered. Maybe the Hessian just wants his head
back.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE: The beheadings are graphic and gory, with much time
spent peering into open neck stumps.
</P>
<P>
   SEX: There are brief semiclothed situations.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY: This being 1799, whatever blasphemies there are
escape modern ears.
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?
</P>
<P>
   UNDER AGE 14: As is always the case with R-rated films,
particularly ones by Burton, many young viewers will gain entry.
Obviously this isn't a film for young children.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 14-17: The director of wildly imaginative films like
``Edward Scissorhands,'' Burton appeals to young audiences, and,
gore or no gore, this one is no exception. Parents can take a stand
or not.

MONTANA GOVERNOR PLEDGES TO ADDRESS LIBBY HEALTH CONCERNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIBBY, Mont. _ As a child, the governor of Montana played in the
piles of asbestos-contaminated vermiculite ore that some residents
in this small mining community say have caused death and disease.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Racicot lived about 12 blocks from the buildings where the
W.R. Grace Co. stored and shipped the vermiculite, which was called
Zonolite. The company also experimented with the raw ore and the
tremolite asbestos it contained.
</P>
<P>
   No one in his family has had any lung diseases, he said
Wednesday, but admitted ``it's been a while'' since he's had a
chest X-ray.
</P>
<P>
   While Racicot may not be concerned about his health, he makes it
clear that that he's unhappy about the possibility that the state
dropped the ball when it came to Libby's health problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm frustrated and extremely worried about the situation,''
Racicot said. ``We have an obligation as a government to protect
our citizens, a statutory obligation, an ethical obligation and
yes, a moral obligation. If we failed to do that, then something is
very wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Racicot went up to the mine frequently, and
remembers the Zonolite being all over town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I played in the piles,'' the governor said. ``We weren't
supposed to, but all the kids played there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had it in our house. I can remember bringing the bags home
and putting it in as insulation in the roof and the walls,'' he
recalled. ``It was in the garden. It was everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   He remembers his favorite ice-fishing spot, down by the conveyor
that carried the ore over the Kootenai River to the railroad cars.
``We were down there quite a bit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A Seattle Post-Intelligencer investigation published last week
found that at least 192 miners and their family members have died
from the tremolite asbestos which contaminated the mine's
vermiculite ore. The newspaper found that another 375 people had
been diagnosed with fatal diseases caused by the fibers.
Information in hundreds of e-mails and telephone calls received by
the P-I indicate that the actual number of deaths and
asbestos-related diseases may be far higher.
</P>
<P>
   The question that is plaguing many residents is: Does a danger
still exist from what W.R. Grace left behind?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's obviously the first question that we're going to
address and we're starting now,'' said the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after years of inaction, there is almost a race to see who
can get to the truth first.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has had an emergency
response team in town for most of the week. They've set up
air-sampling monitors downtown and on the mountain where the mine
was. They're asking for residents who have Zonolite, the
vermiculite insulation, in their homes to allow the air to be
sampled. The EPA team is covering every corner of the community
with an urgency motivated by concern that rain and imminent heavy
snow will preclude meaningful testing.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said that investigators from the Montana Department
of Environmental Quality and the state health department are also
on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for W.R. Grace, which operated the mine from 1963
until it closed in 1990, said the company is extremely busy working
with the state and federal investigators, ``helping to provide
answers to the people of Libby.''
</P>
<P>
   Libby officials, including the mayor, told the P-I that state
agencies and the governor knew about the situation, and if anything
was wrong the governor would have told them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is absolutely not true,'' said Racicot. ``Not a single
official in Libby, Lincoln County nor the state had told me
anything, whatsoever, about the deaths, the amount of illness or
even the lawsuits in that community.''
</P>
<P>
   But the former Montana attorney general added, ``I should have
known.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he has ordered Montana department heads to determine
whether or not their agencies should have been involved in
protecting the public health in Libby.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to investigate that question thoroughly,'' he
said. ``We will determine whether or not that responsibility was
obviated for whatever reason, purposefully, knowingly or
negligently.''
</P>
<P>
   Racicot's grandfather arrived in Libby in 1917 to work as a
logging camp cook. Forty-nine years later, Racicot, then a
high-school senior, led the Libby team to its first and only state
basketball championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great place to grow up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Libby is a beautiful town that hasn't stooped to Western frills
to draw the tourists. The main street is dotted with gun and
antique shops, taxidermists, bookstores and espresso stands. You
can get a huge steak for $12 or gourmet duck with huckleberry
sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 12,000 people or so that live in and near Libby are
feisty and independent, surrounded by the snow-capped Cabinet
Mountains, national forest land, fish-filled rivers and a waterfall
or two.
</P>
<P>
   It has survived the boom and bust of silver, gold and
vermiculite mines and of timber companies slashing their
operations.
</P>
<P>
   As far back as the 1950s, state inspectors were the first to
document that Grace workers were being contaminated with large
amounts of asbestos. But the reports were marked ``confidential''
and were given only to company management.
</P>
<P>
   According to Grace documents and interviews with workers, the
worldwide company never told its employees of the potential hazard
for almost 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would never wash now,'' the governor said. ``It was
before OSHA, it was before the air quality act or the water quality
act. It was before public health became as prominent as it should
have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things we take for granted today ... would be totally foreign
to people in those days,'' he said, adding that at the time,
regulators guaranteed the company confidentiality in order to get
public-health information.
</P>
<P>
   Racicot, a Republican, was elected Montana's 20th governor in
1992. He is now serving a second and final term. The governor is
helping run Texas Gov. George W. Bush's Republican presidential
campaign in the state. And some political types in the region say
he has his eye on a Cabinet position.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his critics say Racicot is ``too nice to be real'' or
``too smooth,'' but none offered any specifics. He may be the only
governor in the nation who drives his own car and has his home
number listed in the phone book.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the problems in Libby, his anger at the state's
inaction is barely concealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going fix what must be fixed and then we're going find
out how it happened,'' he said. ``We want people to see what we're
doing or see what we haven't done.
</P>
<P>
   ``The citizens of this country and of this state understand that
human beings are fallible, but they will not tolerate or understand
human beings not being honest,'' he said.

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ As Americans were celebrating their bounty in family
feasts from Ronkonkoma to Rancho Cucamonga on Thursday, a certain
very sizable goose was also about to be carved by those in the
business of making and selling motion-picture entertainment _ a
golden one.
</P>
<P>
   The four-day Thanksgiving weekend is not only one of the year's
busiest periods for family moviegoing, but it is also a launching
pad for the entire holiday movie season, a six-week period that
accounts for about 16 percent of Hollywood's annual ticket sales,
second only to the summer season in concentrated box-office energy.
</P>
<P>
   And most expect this year's Thanksgiving weekend to be
particularly lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, two major studio films were released nationally _
``Toy Story 2,'' the further computer-animated adventures of Woody
and Buzz Lightyear, and ``End of Days,'' an action film with a
millennium theme starring Arnold Schwarzenegger.
</P>
<P>
   This will also be the second weekend for ``The World Is Not
Enough,'' the new James Bond adventure, and ``Sleepy Hollow,'' a
Tim Burton horror-mystery, both of which earned over $30 million in
their opening weekends and were continuing to perform strongly
through the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a period of time this short, a lot of box office is made
during those weeks,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, chairman of
Exhibitor Relations, which monitors box-office performance. ``It is
a very key time to release a picture. And this year, we believe we
have a strong chance to have a record-breaking weekend, with total
box office of around $200 million, maybe even a bit more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Toy Story 2,'' which is widely expected to finish on top for
the weekend, should bring in more than $50 million alone,
Dergarabedian said. ``The box-office list is going to be real
top-heavy with those four films,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The record for Thanksgiving weekend, $182 million, was set last
year, driven by the release of ``A Bug's Life,'' ``Rugrats: The
Movie'' and ``Enemy of the State.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Viane, president of distribution for Disney, said that
``for movies, it's the best family holiday, the one weekend when
all families are together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a terrific launching pad,'' he continued. ``So many
films have opened near or on Thanksgiving and have gone on to be
blockbusters.''
</P>
<P>
   And a rather astonishing number of the recent ones have come
from Disney. Beginning in 1994, when the Tim Allen comedy ``The
Santa Clause'' came in first over the Thanksgiving holiday, Disney
has been in first place every year, with ``Toy Story'' in 1995
(edging out ``Goldeneye,'' another 007 movie), the live-action
``101 Dalmatians'' in 1996 (beating ``Star Trek: First Contact''),
``Flubber'' in 1997 (against ``Alien: Resurrection'') and ``A Bug's
Life'' last year. ``Toy Story 2'' is likely to make it six in a
row.
</P>
<P>
   As Dergarabedian put it, ```Toy Story' is kind of a can't-lose
proposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Life After Nora
</P>
<P>
   Janet McTeer wandered through the lounge, past the garden and
into the breakfast cafe at the Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills,
extraordinarily tall and poised, fresh from a morning swim to clear
out the jet-lag cobwebs left by a flight from London.
</P>
<P>
   Cast your mind back about three years, to when Ms. McTeer, an
accomplished British stage actress, rapidly became the toast of
Broadway for her Tony-winning turn as Nora in a highly praised
adaptation of ``A Doll's House.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McTeer, 37, remembers it as a heady but ultimately
exhausting time, exciting for the number of people who came
backstage to shower her with praise and flowers and for the
enthusiasm of the Broadway audiences, but draining for the demands
of the role, night after night. Many wondered during that play's
run what Ms. McTeer would do for an encore. The first thing she
did, she said, was take some time off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never been to New York before I did that play, never
lived there, and I found that I really liked it and thought, well,
why not stay around and see what happens,'' Ms. McTeer said. ``I
was offered one or two things immediately, but after doing Nora for
so long I decided I really didn't want to work any more that
year.''
</P>
<P>
   After a few months' rest, as 1997 turned into 1998, she also
found that a lot of the film roles she was being offered were not
as interesting as she had hoped. ``It might have been different if
I'd been a 22-year-old ingenue, but there you are,'' Ms. McTeer
said.
</P>
<P>
   So she moved back to London and played a series of roles, large
and small, in independent films of modest budget. Now the first of
them, ``Tumbleweeds,'' is being released in the United States, and
those who saw Ms. McTeer on the stage will not be surprised to
learn that it is causing her name to be mentioned as a possible
Oscar nominee.
</P>
<P>
   She plays Mary Jo Walker, a working-class woman from North
Carolina who drags her teen-age daughter on a cross-country flit
from bad relationship to bad relationship, finally trying to settle
down and sort out her life in a small seaside town in California.
The film, directed by Gavin O'Connor, is loosely based on the real
relationship between the screenwriter Angela Shelton and her
mother.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McTeer said she went to North Carolina last year to spend
some time with Ms. Shelton and her mother and to soak up the local
accent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had a good feeling about the script and about the
character,'' she said, ``and it gave me a chance to do something I
had never done before, which is always something you look for.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tumbleweeds'' opened in New York and Los Angeles on Wednesday
and will expand to more cities on Dec. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Ms. McTeer said, she will probably head back to London and
spend time around the house _ ``just in time for the worst weather
of the year, ridiculous timing'' _ while she begins searching for a
new play. She wants to return to the stage next year, preferably
with something new. After that, maybe more films, if something
catches her fancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, I just make it up as I go along,'' Ms. McTeer said.
``I mean, if something came along for a lot of money and it was
interesting, then yes, absolutely, like a shot. But otherwise, I'd
rather do stuff I like to do. I figure, as long as I can pay the
rent.''

</P>
<P>
   An Emotional Role
</P>
<P>
   Sigourney Weaver made her way through the lounge and into the
breakfast cafe at the Four Seasons Hotel in Toronto. Like Ms.
McTeer, she is tall and poised. For those keeping score, the two
actresses once appeared in the same film, ``Half Moon Street''
(1986), in which Ms. Weaver had top billing and Ms. McTeer was
listed 38th in the cast credits, playing ``Van Arkady's
Secretary,'' sandwiched between actors playing ``TV Newscaster''
and ``Second Lady.''
</P>
<P>
   Also like Ms. McTeer, Ms. Weaver is on the receiving end of some
whispers about a possible Oscar nomination, for the lead role in
``A Map of the World,'' an adaptation of Jane Hamilton's wrenching
family drama directed by Scott Elliott, the New York stage
director.
</P>
<P>
   When Elliott offered her the role of Alice Goodwin without even
meeting her, Ms. Weaver said, she was surprised and immediately
eager to do it. Only later did she begin to fret about the
emotional trek she would have to take during the filming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found I had a real resistance to going through all that I
needed to go through with Alice,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, though, she was helped by the rapid pace of
shooting necessitated by the film's relatively small budget. It
forced her through some of the difficult passages.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it was a tumble of events,'' Ms. Weaver said. ``You
hardly come up for air.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A Map of the World'' is a fairly dark story about a school
nurse who is, at least to some degree, responsible for the
accidental death of a friend's child. As if that were not enough,
she is also charged with sexually abusing a schoolchild and is
chucked into the local jail. The film is being released for one
week in New York and Los Angeles beginning on Dec. 3 to qualify for
the Academy Awards, with a wider release sometime early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Weaver said she visited Ms. Hamilton and a Wisconsin jail
near the Hamilton home, where she was allowed to spend time among
the prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   ``What struck me was the total lack of privacy,'' she said.
``There was no escape from the television. You were with these
people day and night. It was something.''
</P>
<P>
   It was certainly different from her other upcoming role, in the
big-budget comedy ``Galaxy Quest,'' in which she plays a somewhat
dim actress on a science-fiction show whom aliens mistake for a
real starship trooper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been waiting for years to be offered the role of the
mother,'' said Ms. Weaver, 50. ``For some reason, I never was.''

   `TOY STORY 2'
</P>
<P>
   With the voices of Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Joan Cusack, Kelsey
Grammer, Don Rickles, Jim Varney, Wallace Shawn, John Morris, Annie
Potts, John Ratzenberger &QL; 
Directed by John Lasseter.
</P>
<P>
   Rated G _ 92 minutes
</P>
<P>
   It's a busy morning in Andy's room, with the computer-animated
characters introduced four years ago in ``Toy Story'' hustling
around doing chores and noting postings of coming classes (``what
to do if part of you is swallowed''). But then disaster. About to
go off to day camp with Andy, Woody the cowhand gets one of his
shoulders ripped and is discarded on the top shelf. Next, Andy's
mom sweeps the room looking for old toys to put out for a yard
sale.
</P>
<P>
   After a dangerous mission to free their fellows about to be
bought, Woody and his friend the astronaut Buzz Lightyear grapple
with still another calamity. Woody is stolen by a fat toy dealer,
Big Al McWhiggin, who recognizes the cowpoke as the hero of an old
television show and wants to sell him and some other toy Westerners
to a museum in Japan. Trapped in Big Al's house, Woody meets the
others destined for display in a glass case: a cowgirl named Jessie
and a prospector, Stinky Pete, who hangs out in the box he was
packaged in.
</P>
<P>
   To spring Woody, Buzz rallies all the folk from Andy's room, a
gung-ho Buzz Lightyear knockoff and some hard-partying Barbie dolls
they run into in Big Al's superstore. But Pete and Jessie want
Woody to go to Japan with them because without him the deal is off
and they'll be put back in storage. Torn between old and new
friends, Woody ponders which way to turn.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE: Playthings get some rough treatment, both physical and
emotional, but nothing is too disturbing for too long.
</P>
<P>
   SEX: None.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY: None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-9: Strongly focused on standing by friends in times of
trouble, the film is also highly entertaining, which will delight
children all through this bracket, and is droll enough to engage
their parents, too, at least for as long as it needs to.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 10-11: By this age, a mixed reaction will set in, but most
viewers will enjoy themselves.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 12 AND UP: A rating milder than a PG-13 usually sounds the
evacuation, but perhaps not so loudly for a film that some
teen-agers will find more entertaining than they bargained for.
</P>
<P>
   `POKEMON: THE FIRST MOVIE'
</P>

<P>
   Meanwhile, in another animated film that is undergoing multiple
viewings by many very small children and their flagging parents,
basic questions are posed about the ability of all creatures to get
along with their cloned likenesses.
</P>
<P>
   In a laboratory on New Island, evil scientists bioengineer
Mewtwo, a large, nasty flying cat who is about 10 times the size of
his model, Mew, the rarest of the 151 little monsters who
understand Pokemon. But Mewtwo, a clone who asks questions, demands
to know what his purpose is and, finding no good answer, finally
determines he has been made to rule the world. Chasing off the
scientists, the clone lures the best Pokemon monsters and trainers
to New Island for a showdown with all the cloned Pokemons he has
created.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he whips up a terrible storm, which threatens
all those at sea and on land. Staying true to their pacifistic
tendencies, the real Pokemon refuse to fight. Eventually the
message gets through to Mewtwo, who calls off the battle and calms
the waters.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE: There is much violence, both real and threatened, but
it is presented in ways that are not disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   SEX: None.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY: None.
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-12: Supposedly teaching children about responsibility,
teamwork and obedience, the Pokemon craze has taken firm hold
within this age band, but without the brand name the film makes
very ordinary kiddie fare.

   `THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH'
</P>
<P>
   Pierce Brosnan, Sophie Marceau, Robert Carlyle, Denise Richards,
Dame Judi Dench
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Michael Apted
</P>
<P>
   Rated PG-13 _ 128 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Apologies for the commotion but that rocket-assisted speedboat
passing through a couple of crowded restaurants needs to reconnect
with the water if it's to cut off the streaking craft driven by the
raven-haired assassin. Yes, it's James Bond (Brosnan) again, along
with Q (Desmond Llewelyn), the weapons designer who devised the
Bond boat; Q's new assistant, R (John Cleese), and M (Dame Judi),
who passes out assignments to the agent numbered 007.
</P>
<P>
   This time Bond's task is to protect Elektra (Ms. Marceau) from
Renard (Carlyle), a lugubrious terrorist with a droopy eye. In the
recent past, Renard kidnapped Elektra, the daughter of an oil
baron, in a celebrated case and now threatens humanity with schemes
no one is quite sure of but could involve unauthorized use of
nuclear materials. Unfazed by the threat and convinced that no man,
including Bond, can resist her, Elektra tends to her pipeline by
the Caspian Sea, which, if she plays her politics right, should all
but corner the oil flow from the former Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
   Renard's plans include a little bomb factory in the desert
staffed by Dr. Christmas Jones (Ms. Richards), a nuclear weapons
expert who looks good in shorts, has a sassy attitude and speaks
both Russian and MTV. Nevertheless, Elektra is the one to watch
here. Bond is captivated (up to a point), but then M is kidnapped
and Renard appears to have gained the upper hand in ways entirely
unanticipated.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE: Expect the usual Bondfire: explosions, sprays of
gunfire, knifings, stranglings, falls from high places, suffocation
in tight places and much hand-to-hand combat. But there is little
blood, let alone any sense of reality, and whatever the damage,
everybody quickly moves on.
</P>
<P>
   SEX: Bond, of course, goes to bed with almost every woman he
comes across. As with violence, however, sex is sanitized and
limited to decorative shots of pretty half-covered people lolling
about like mannequins. (And while product placement is inevitable,
one wishes there was at least something Bond could do without
flashing his wristwatch.)
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY: None.
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?
</P>
<P>
   UNDER AGE 10: Some parents will take small children to this
film, and while no one will emerge lastingly traumatized, maybe
``Toy Story 2'' or another round of ``Pokemon'' would be more
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 11 AND UP: Bond movies play old for many teen-agers, who
like their action harder, hipper and undandified. But for all the
violence and sex, the film is about the most harmless parents can
hope for from the genre.
</P>
<P>
   `SLEEPY HOLLOW'
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, Michael
Gambon, Christopher Walken, Casper Van Dien
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Tim Burton
</P>
<P>
   Rated R _ 110 minutes
</P>
<P>
   In Burton's darkly expressionistic reworking of the Washington
Irving story, Ichabod Crane (Depp), now a squeamish and rather
brainy investigator from New York City, is sent up the Hudson River
to the village of Sleepy Hollow, where select members of the shady
little citizenry have been getting their heads lopped off by, it is
said, a horseman who apparently was relieved of his own in the same
manner.
</P>
<P>
   Packing elaborate investigatory implements of his own invention,
young Crane no sooner pronounces that there could be no such thing
as a headless horseman than he is fleeing one at a full gallop. On
a great black steed, the headless fellow swings his sword with
precise efficiency, but he is mysteriously choosy about his
victims, who include women and children. In flashbacks to his
earlier existence, he has a head (Walken's) and turns out to be a
Hessian soldier who lived and died by the sword during the
Revolutionary War 25 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the mercenary has returned from hell, but what he's
after and why remain unresolved. Steeling himself, Ichabod scraps
with the horseman occasionally and follows developments to a tree
of evil, stuffed with heads, from which the horseman emerges for
his murderous rides. Exposed neck stems are examined and a village
conspiracy is uncovered. Maybe the Hessian just wants his head
back.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE: The beheadings are graphic and gory, with much time
spent peering into open neck stumps.
</P>
<P>
   SEX: There are brief semiclothed situations.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY: This being 1799, whatever blasphemies there are
escape modern ears.
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?
</P>
<P>
   UNDER AGE 14: As is always the case with R-rated films,
particularly ones by Burton, many young viewers will gain entry.
Obviously this isn't a film for young children.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 14-17: The director of wildly imaginative films like
``Edward Scissorhands,'' Burton appeals to young audiences, and,
gore or no gore, this one is no exception. Parents can take a stand
or not.

MONTANA GOVERNOR PLEDGES TO ADDRESS LIBBY HEALTH CONCERNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIBBY, Mont. _ As a child, the governor of Montana played in the
piles of asbestos-contaminated vermiculite ore that some residents
in this small mining community say have caused death and disease.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Racicot lived about 12 blocks from the buildings where the
W.R. Grace Co. stored and shipped the vermiculite, which was called
Zonolite. The company also experimented with the raw ore and the
tremolite asbestos it contained.
</P>
<P>
   No one in his family has had any lung diseases, he said
Wednesday, but admitted ``it's been a while'' since he's had a
chest X-ray.
</P>
<P>
   While Racicot may not be concerned about his health, he makes it
clear that that he's unhappy about the possibility that the state
dropped the ball when it came to Libby's health problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm frustrated and extremely worried about the situation,''
Racicot said. ``We have an obligation as a government to protect
our citizens, a statutory obligation, an ethical obligation and
yes, a moral obligation. If we failed to do that, then something is
very wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Racicot went up to the mine frequently, and
remembers the Zonolite being all over town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I played in the piles,'' the governor said. ``We weren't
supposed to, but all the kids played there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had it in our house. I can remember bringing the bags home
and putting it in as insulation in the roof and the walls,'' he
recalled. ``It was in the garden. It was everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   He remembers his favorite ice-fishing spot, down by the conveyor
that carried the ore over the Kootenai River to the railroad cars.
``We were down there quite a bit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A Seattle Post-Intelligencer investigation published last week
found that at least 192 miners and their family members have died
from the tremolite asbestos which contaminated the mine's
vermiculite ore. The newspaper found that another 375 people had
been diagnosed with fatal diseases caused by the fibers.
Information in hundreds of e-mails and telephone calls received by
the P-I indicate that the actual number of deaths and
asbestos-related diseases may be far higher.
</P>
<P>
   The question that is plaguing many residents is: Does a danger
still exist from what W.R. Grace left behind?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's obviously the first question that we're going to
address and we're starting now,'' said the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after years of inaction, there is almost a race to see who
can get to the truth first.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has had an emergency
response team in town for most of the week. They've set up
air-sampling monitors downtown and on the mountain where the mine
was. They're asking for residents who have Zonolite, the
vermiculite insulation, in their homes to allow the air to be
sampled. The EPA team is covering every corner of the community
with an urgency motivated by concern that rain and imminent heavy
snow will preclude meaningful testing.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said that investigators from the Montana Department
of Environmental Quality and the state health department are also
on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for W.R. Grace, which operated the mine from 1963
until it closed in 1990, said the company is extremely busy working
with the state and federal investigators, ``helping to provide
answers to the people of Libby.''
</P>
<P>
   Libby officials, including the mayor, told the P-I that state
agencies and the governor knew about the situation, and if anything
was wrong the governor would have told them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is absolutely not true,'' said Racicot. ``Not a single
official in Libby, Lincoln County nor the state had told me
anything, whatsoever, about the deaths, the amount of illness or
even the lawsuits in that community.''
</P>
<P>
   But the former Montana attorney general added, ``I should have
known.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he has ordered Montana department heads to determine
whether or not their agencies should have been involved in
protecting the public health in Libby.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to investigate that question thoroughly,'' he
said. ``We will determine whether or not that responsibility was
obviated for whatever reason, purposefully, knowingly or
negligently.''
</P>
<P>
   Racicot's grandfather arrived in Libby in 1917 to work as a
logging camp cook. Forty-nine years later, Racicot, then a
high-school senior, led the Libby team to its first and only state
basketball championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great place to grow up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Libby is a beautiful town that hasn't stooped to Western frills
to draw the tourists. The main street is dotted with gun and
antique shops, taxidermists, bookstores and espresso stands. You
can get a huge steak for $12 or gourmet duck with huckleberry
sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 12,000 people or so that live in and near Libby are
feisty and independent, surrounded by the snow-capped Cabinet
Mountains, national forest land, fish-filled rivers and a waterfall
or two.
</P>
<P>
   It has survived the boom and bust of silver, gold and
vermiculite mines and of timber companies slashing their
operations.
</P>
<P>
   As far back as the 1950s, state inspectors were the first to
document that Grace workers were being contaminated with large
amounts of asbestos. But the reports were marked ``confidential''
and were given only to company management.
</P>
<P>
   According to Grace documents and interviews with workers, the
worldwide company never told its employees of the potential hazard
for almost 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would never wash now,'' the governor said. ``It was
before OSHA, it was before the air quality act or the water quality
act. It was before public health became as prominent as it should
have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things we take for granted today ... would be totally foreign
to people in those days,'' he said, adding that at the time,
regulators guaranteed the company confidentiality in order to get
public-health information.
</P>
<P>
   Racicot, a Republican, was elected Montana's 20th governor in
1992. He is now serving a second and final term. The governor is
helping run Texas Gov. George W. Bush's Republican presidential
campaign in the state. And some political types in the region say
he has his eye on a Cabinet position.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his critics say Racicot is ``too nice to be real'' or
``too smooth,'' but none offered any specifics. He may be the only
governor in the nation who drives his own car and has his home
number listed in the phone book.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the problems in Libby, his anger at the state's
inaction is barely concealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going fix what must be fixed and then we're going find
out how it happened,'' he said. ``We want people to see what we're
doing or see what we haven't done.
</P>
<P>
   ``The citizens of this country and of this state understand that
human beings are fallible, but they will not tolerate or understand
human beings not being honest,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Acting awards may be self-indulgent and tacky. But as
long as we're stuck with them, why shouldn't there be a
high-powered set of them for Off Broadway? Within the theater
industry, the Obies, administered by The Village Voice, have
considerable prestige, and the Drama Desks, parceled out to actors
and productions on Broadway and off, certainly merit mention in
Playbill bios.
</P>
<P>
   Yet no one has devised the widely recognizable acting prizes
that Off Broadway has so abundantly earned. I raise the issue (and
not for the first time) not so much to encourage the further
glitzing of New York's serious theater as to point out that when
one has a hankering for great performances, more often than not the
first places to look for satisfaction these days are the city's
smaller stages.
</P>
<P>
   Why this is so has a lot to do, of course, with the desperate
recession of the straight play on Broadway: Apart from John
Pielmeier's failed thriller, ``Voices in the Dark,'' no new
Broadway play will have opened this season until David Hirson's
``Wrong Mountain'' bows in January. No such drought parches Off
Broadway's landscape, however. There are, as always, a diverse and
exceptional array of performers originating roles in new works and
offering audiences that tantalizing drug of the theater: hope.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year you could share the theatrical wealth with
Viola Davis as the pitiable murderess in ``Everybody's Ruby'' at
the Joseph Papp Public Theater; Lynne Thigpen setting off the bulk
of the fireworks in ``Jar the Floor'' at Second Stage; Geoffrey
Nauffts, Jodie Markell and David Alan Basche as unsettled yuppies
in ``Snakebit'' for Naked Angels; and Darius de Haas as the young
man lost to heroin and heartbreak in the Music-Theater Group's
``Running Man.''
</P>
<P>
   They are only a sampling of who has come and gone of late
(although there is talk of an impending transfer of ``Jar the
Floor'' to Broadway). The pleasure of Off Broadway is that the door
to discovery is a revolving one; the next terrific turn by an actor
of note _ whether a familiar face or a complete unknown _ is only a
matter of time.
</P>
<P>
   As this is the season for giving, it's the ideal moment for a
few reminders of the ways in which seamless, stylish performances
are prizes unto themselves. Here, then, are a half-dozen examples
of why casting directors for new Off Broadway plays may be the
luckiest people in town.
</P>
<P>
   STEPHEN SPINELLA: What a touching portrait of foolishness
Spinella provides in ``James Joyce's `The Dead,''' the new musical
based on the famous Joyce short story, now at Playwrights Horizons
and moving to Broadway next month. On a stage overrun with fine
singing actors _ among them Blair Brown, Marni Nixon, Sally Ann
Howes and Emily Skinner _ Spinella sets his own ebullient pace as
Freddy Malins, the happy drunk who so good-naturedly puts his foot
in his mouth and leaves it there.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is given such a beautifully drawn character in this
musically rich if dramatically flawed evening; in thick mustache
and natty bow tie, Spinella, who won back-to-back Tonys in 1993 and
1994 for his work in the two parts of ``Angels in America,'' makes
of Freddy a poignant party clown.
</P>
<P>
   The actor, thankfully, avoids the pitfalls of ethnic stereotype.
His bar song, ``Three Jolly Pigeons,'' lifts the spirits as it
celebrates spirits. Yet his Freddy is also a vaguely tragic
character, drifting and remote, you intuit, whenever the music
isn't playing.
</P>
<P>
   LISA EMERY: In a crucial Act 2 encounter in ``Dinner With
Friends,'' Donald Margulies' splendid dissection of the anxiety
that exists side by side with the comfort of long-term
companionship, Ms. Emery's Karen sits down to lunch on a patio with
her best friend, Beth, who is recently divorced and newly ecstatic
over finding love again.
</P>
<P>
   The scene progresses amiably until Beth, played wonderfully by
Julie White, announces that she is going to marry again. The news
upsets Karen in ways that seem unreasonable, and Beth lets her have
it, accusing Karen of casting her as the perennial loser, of always
needing her to remain a basket case.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Ms. Emery process the information at the Variety Arts
Theater is like peering into the back of a television set: You
marvel at the sophisticated circuitry. Ms. Emery's Karen is a fuse
that never burns completely down in ``Dinner With Friends,'' and
you are thankful for that. There is the sense in her performance of
a fury that is better kept in check, and the thrill of her work
here is that the danger of it exploding is ever present.
</P>
<P>
   MARK MCKINNEY: Daffy plays can go skin-crawlingly awry in the
wrong hands. In the right ones, they're lighter than lemon
meringue. And no one in the seriously loopy ``Fuddy Meers'' is
righter or lighter than McKinney, who is emerging as one of the
top-flight comic actors on the New York stage.
</P>
<P>
   You may know his face from television, mostly squeezed into the
wee hours: He performed for many years with the all-male Canadian
comedy troupe ``Kids in the Hall.'' His Spanish ambassador was the
funniest player in the Roundabout's ``Flea in Her Ear'' a couple of
years back, and his Millet, the dimwitted master of the sock puppet
in David Lindsay-Abaire's hilarious new seven-character play on
Stage II at the Manhattan Theater Club, is a goofball whom any fan
of ``The Three Stooges'' can love.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Fuddy Meers,'' the puppet, Hinky Binky, which looks like a
golf club cover with hands, is Millet's alter ego. Think of a
Muppet with the mouth of Andrew Dice Clay, and you're in Hinky
Binky's ballpark. Playing Millet and the puppet off each other,
McKinney is a regular riot. One-man shows in New York have played
to acclaim with a lot less going for them.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   LINDA EMOND: Ms. Emond is one of those heroes of the theater who
seem incapable of anything but excellence. In ``An Experiment With
an Air Pump'' on the Manhattan Theater Club's main stage, she
contributes yet another deeply intelligent and fully rounded
performance to a growing list of personal successes, in shows like
``The Dying Gaul,'' ``Baby Anger'' and ``1776.''
</P>
<P>
   The cast of Shelagh Stephenson's ``Experiment,'' which deals
with the price of progress in two eras 200 years apart, is
uniformly good. (Daniel Gerroll and Seana Kofoed are among the
other standouts.) Ms. Emond, though, provides an extra level of
satisfaction in the difficult task of doubling in the roles of two
women _ one a frustrated wife in 1799, the other an ambitious
geneticist in 1999 _ who offer a concise history lesson in the
changing role of women across the ages.
</P>
<P>
   Her introductory moments as the geneticist are some of her best.
Called upon to reveal the character's passion for science, Ms.
Emond takes us through a study of the 18th-century painting that
gives the play its title. As related by the actress, it's a lovely,
inviting prologue that offers immediate access to the interlocking
themes of Ms. Stephenson's time-traveling play.
</P>
<P>
   SEAN MARTIN HINGSTON:
</P>
<P>
   Everyone makes a fuss about the Girl in the Yellow Dress. But
what about the Guy in the Hairnet? Hingston is one of only two
members of the 22-person ensemble who appears in all three of the
dance plays that make up ``Contact,'' the hit evening of
dance-driven narrative at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater (and moving
to the Beaumont in March).
</P>
<P>
   Can you spot him in all three? In the first, ``Swinging,'' a
teasing curtain-raiser inspired by an 18th-century painting, ``The
Swing,'' Hingston is the hunky, poker-faced servant, pushing a
sexually available young maid on a swing at her afternoon tryst
with another man. In the third piece, ``Contact,'' he plays one of
the virile young swing dancers rejected again and again by the
woman in yellow (Deborah Yates).
</P>
<P>
   The inside joke is apparent in the second piece, ``Did You
Move?'' in which Hingston is disguised as a cretinous restaurant
employee, in glasses and hairnet, dragging Italian foodstuffs
across the floor of the Queens restaurant in which Karen Ziemba
dances her whimsical dream ballet. The gamut he runs in
``Contact,'' from desirable to repulsive, is in both choreographic
and dramatic terms, a leap of imagination.
</P>
<P>
   PAULA PIZZI: Ms. Pizzi has a slightly mysterious accent: It
sounds vaguely Mediterranean. Her character's name, Susie Monahan,
sheds no light on her origins. But there's nothing the least bit
inauthentic about her performance as the empathetic nurse in
``Wit,'' the Pulitzer Prize-winning and astonishingly long-running
play at the Union Square Theater about a poetry professor's
intellectual, emotional and terminal struggle with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   If it is surprising that a play that deals so realistically with
illness has developed a loyal following _ any drama that runs more
than a year in New York has to qualify as a minor miracle _ the
work of actors like Ms. Pizzi goes some way in explaining why. Her
rendering of a nurse who ministers as much to the person as to the
disease is the playwright Margaret Edson's sole acknowledgment here
of the medical world's ability to feel as well as heal.
</P>
<P>
   The director Derek Anson Jones could not have cast the role with
a more profound sense of where the play's conscience lies. Ms.
Pizzi's Susie is a lamb until her patient requires a tiger, and it
is when this actress crosses over to fierceness in the climactic
scene that ``Wit'' gives full vent to the outrages against the soul
that some doctors may perpetrate in the name of fixing the body.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Confirming widely held suspicions, the producers of
``Wise Guys,'' the new musical by Stephen Sondheim, said this week
that the show would not transfer to Broadway in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came less than a week after the completion of a
monthlong ``workshop presentation'' at the New York Theater
Workshop, where the creative team, including Sondheim and the
director, Sam Mendes, had put together a rough version of the
musical.
</P>
<P>
   The presentation, which was seen by the workshop's subscribers
and most of the city's theatrical elite, apparently confirmed
producers' sense that the musical needed more work before being
offered to an uptown audience. The show had tentatively been
scheduled to open on Broadway in April; sets had been designed and
a theater promised.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond confirming the postponement, neither the creative team
nor the producers would comment on the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wise Guys'' was not open to critics, but several producers who
saw it said the score showed many of the hallmarks of Sondheim's
career, including clever, ironic lyrics and complex, filigreed
melodies. What was lacking, they said, was a cohesive dramatic
vision of how and why the story should be told.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem at the center was `Why are these people
interesting?''' one producer said.
</P>
<P>
   Sondheim first came upon the story behind ``Wise Guys'' in 1952
but only began to work on the piece in earnest in 1995. The musical
follows the lives of Wilson and Addison Mizner, real-life brothers
whose exploits in con games and Florida real estate, respectively,
earned them minor celebrity status in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan Lane and Victor Garber starred as Wilson and Addison, and
there were more than a dozen new songs by Sondheim and a book by
the playwright John Weidman, who collaborated with Sondheim on
``Pacific Overtures'' (1976) and ``Assassins'' (1991).
</P>
<P>
   The show had a reading last spring before embarking on its
unconventional stint at the workshop in late October. Early
presentations included only the first act while Sondheim and
Weidman worked to complete the show. Although strides were made,
production members said that by mid-November it became evident that
the piece wasn't ready for Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Insiders said the issue of dramatic style was also present from
the early days of the workshop, with Sondheim and Weidman
preferring a lighter, more vaudevillian feel for the piece, while
Mendes and others favored a more substantial narrative. Weidman's
book was also battled over, though production members said the
artistic differences did not blow up into fights, firings or bad
blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were never any raised voices,'' said one production
member. ``The furrowed brows were people trying to work things
out.''
</P>
<P>
   The next step is an open question. Mendes has offered to take
the production to Donmar Warehouse in London, where he is the
artistic director. Another director or an additional writer may be
considered, and more work on the book and score is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Still, several people in the audience said there were signs of
real, combustible dramatic life in the last week of the
presentation, when the whole piece was on its feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be an enormous pity,'' one member of the production
said, ``if the world didn't get a chance to see this show again.''
</P>
<P>
   Two for Mae West
</P>
<P>
   Mae West just loved quipping _ especially on twos. ``It takes
two to get one in trouble,'' she used to say or be quoted as
saying. ``Between two evils,'' she'd testify, ``I always pick the
one I never tried before.''
</P>
<P>
   So it's appropriate that next month, West and her fabulous
vocabulary will come to life in two productions. First up is her
rarely seen play, ``Sex,'' in which West, not surprisingly,
chronicles the life of a good-time girl. The play, which West wrote
under the pseudonym Jane Mast, got off to a somewhat notorious
start and was not particularly loved when it opened in April 1926
at Daly's 63rd Street Theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``A crude, inept play,'' wrote a displeased Brooks Atkinson in
The New York Times in a different era, adding breathlessly that its
``torrid love scene'' had sent ``several couples out into the
night.''
</P>
<P>
   The producers this time around, the Hourglass Group, have jazzed
up the script with original music after negotiating for three years
with West's estate to stage the first revival of the piece in New
York City. It begins Dec. 9 at the Gershwin Hotel on East 27th
Street.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 11, meanwhile, performances begin at New York Theater
Workshop for ``Dirty Blonde'' by Claudia Shear. Set in modern-day
New York, the play follows two fanatical fans on the trail of
West's legacy. All of which is enough to throw in one last apercu
from West: ``Virtue has its own reward, but has no sale at the box
office.''
</P>
<P>
   An Irish Mother Lode
</P>
<P>
   Word this week that Gabriel Byrne would make his U.S. stage
debut in Eugene O'Neill's ``Moon for the Misbegotten'' at the
Walter Kerr Theater in March makes him just the latest prominent
Irish actor to make his way to Broadway from the humble stages of
the Project Theater.
</P>
<P>
   An introduction may be necessary. The Project Theater, formally
known as the Project Arts Center, is the oldest alternative arts
center in Ireland, if one of its least known outside Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   Housed in an old printing works in the hip Temple Bar section of
town, the Project has nurtured an esteemed list of actors,
including Colm Meaney, Liam Neeson and Stephen Rea, who performed
there alongside Byrne in the early 1980s. Other alumni include the
filmmakers Neil Jordan and Jim Sheridan, whose brother Peter
Sheridan once helped run the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Byrne remembers it thus: ``It was about the size of a
medium-size garage. You could fit maybe four or five cars in it. Or
60 or 70 people. We did contemporaries and classics and revivals,
everything. And none of us knew anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Now in its 33rd year, the Project is about to give up its old
home for a $5.2 million new building with two theaters and a
gallery. ``They've dickied it up nice,'' Byrne said, ``but I'll
remember its former beauty.''

FEZ REVEALS MOROCCO'S SOUL, AND CAN TAKE YOU BACK 1,000 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Nov. 28) 
 (bl)  
 By MARLISE SIMONS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Behold the city of Fez as it looked in the year 1000.
</P>
<P>
   Nestled in a high valley, it was resplendent with its domes and
minarets. Smoke rose from pottery kilns and public bath houses.
There was the banging of the metalworkers, the whirr of the
weavers, the wailing of the muezzins as they called for prayers and
drowned out the shouts of the beggars and traders.
</P>
<P>
   Along the narrow alleys, smells oozed from the wood-stoked bread
ovens, from the pots of lamb stew and from the hair of mules
lugging their loads. Down by the river, where the tanners worked,
an overwhelming fetor surged from the pigeon dung and the fermented
chaff that they used to treat goat and camel hides.
</P>
<P>
   There were some quiet spots, to be sure: the spaces around the
sacred fountains and the halls of the mosque-university, which was
famous for its wise men, with students flocking here from afar.
</P>
<P>
   That was Fez 10 centuries ago. Remarkably, it is a description
that remains valid today. The city's astonishing chemistry of the
medina, or oldest section, is still intact.
</P>
<P>
   Over the ages, Fez has sprawled outward, far beyond the great
walls that secured it, and in the alleys, the mules now also lug
plastic buckets and television sets. Still, the old Fez survives,
battered and declining, but by many accounts the most complete
medieval city of the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   Now Morocco's third largest city, Fez is no longer the capital,
but it still lays claim to being the country's cultural,
intellectual and religious heart. Its medina is the most complex,
with more ancient monuments, more mosques, Koranic schools, inns
and souks than any Moroccan city. The beauty of its woodcarvings,
tiles and pottery remain unmatched. Other towns may be selling a
rich choice of crafts, but chances are that many come from Fez _
and better still, in this city, you can watch the artisans make
them.
</P>
<P>
   Moroccans say that Marrakesh, Rabat and Casablanca live in the
present, but that Fez lives in the past. It comes as no surprise.
European chroniclers of the Middle Ages wrote with awe of the city
that for several centuries was the most civilized Western outpost
of the Semitic world. Its scholars introduced astronomy and
medicine to the West via Spain when it was under Moorish rule.
Historians of the time said that Plato and Aristotle first reached
Western Europe in Arabic translations, from Fez.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to find out why some insiders spoke of Fez as an
addiction, why they called it not a place, but a state of mind.
Driss Laraichi, a guide and more than that, a skilled historian and
poet, said that discovering Fez would take patience, but that even
an outsider could catch a glimpse of its soul.
</P>
<P>
   One fine place to start, Driss said, was the Hotel Les
Merinides. It rises above the northern edge of the city, near the
tombs of the Merinid rulers. Though ugly and modern, the hotel has
a great terrace overlooking the city, with a stone map from 1935,
which by local standards is contemporary.
</P>
<P>
   The medina, which is where you want to be, is too tightly packed
to offer perspective. But from the terrace, the old city reveals
itself as an amphitheater, embraced by enormous walls. Opposite the
main city gates, the hillsides are studded with the stones of
age-old cemeteries and near them, crowned with white domes, the
larger tombs of the city's numerous holy men. There is the sense of
observing a North African Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   From above, you can pick out the main mosques, the royal palace,
the medersas or colleges, the old Jewish quarter and Fez's holiest
building, the revered shrine of Moulay Idriss II. Forget the
buildings for a moment to hear a fragment of history that is
indispensable: the story of this holy man is part of the creation
of Islamic Morocco. It was his father, Moulay Idriss I who arrived
here around 787, possibly from Baghdad, to convert the region's
Berber tribes. It is said that he was a great grandson of the
prophet Muhammad. Idriss I founded Fez, which became the core of
Arabic Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   The way into the medina passes through a bab, one of its great
gates. It can take hours to cross this great maze of more than 600
acres (about three-quarters the size of Central Park), packed with
some 250,000 people. But the rewards are instant, for here an
intricate and grand human engine is in perpetual motion.
</P>
<P>
   Under the lattice mats that filter the sun are street stalls
selling goats' feet, entrails, fresh cheese, quinces and piles and
piles of mint. Workshops the size of walk-in closets hold tailors,
woodcarvers, engravers, weavers, embroiderers, calligraphers and
just about any other trade.
</P>
<P>
   Professions usually cluster in the same alley. Here and there,
weighers offer the services of their large iron scales. You are
pressed against walls and stalls as porters and mule drivers shout,
demanding the right of way.
</P>
<P>
   Going deeper inside the labyrinth, Driss led the way into an
even earlier world, a place of alchemists. There were men with
bellows firing the hearths for the copper workers. A stream of
blood gushed down one passage. It turned out to be the alley of the
dyers who had just finished dunking big skeins of silk and wool
into a deep wine color and were now emptying their vats.
</P>
<P>
   We stopped at a cord maker, an acquaintance of Driss. His
workshop was just a small wooden platform, three feet off the
ground. He sat crosslegged and was tying strands of silk around his
big toe. Then he turned and plaited these with extraordinary
patience till they became cords for prayer beads or braids for a
kaftan. He told Driss he had done this since he was 10; he was now
60. On a good day he could make roughly $5.
</P>
<P>
   Above his head, next to a diploma with his name, Mohamed ben Ali
Amrani, he had put up a sign in English: ``No photographs.'' I
asked him why.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am here as God's guest on earth,'' he said. ``The tourists
were taking pictures without even asking, as if I was an animal.''
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the medina and its most important site is the great
Karaouine Mosque, which is also the nation's oldest and one of its
largest. A wealthy woman, Fatima Alfehri, who fled from Tunisia,
founded it in 859. And it was here, where the mosque with its great
library expanded into a center of learning, well before the
universities of Bologna and Oxford, that the city's intellectual
fame blossomed.
</P>
<P>
   Non-Muslims may not enter this enormous building, whose 16 naves
are said to accommodate 20,000 people. But from the alley that
winds around it, they can glimpse past its mighty doors and see its
courtyards, fountains and part of its halls.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, the shrine of Moulay Idriss II attracts pilgrims from
all over the country and from across North and West Africa. Again,
we could look only through the open gates at the stirring sight of
supplicants arriving at the tomb, some blind or crippled, holding
candles, delivering messages, some prostrate in prayer, some asleep
on the floor of the mosque. From a side alley, a biblical image
suddenly appeared: a man striding slowly with a lamb draped around
his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``A sacrifice,'' Driss whispered, and beckoned me to follow him.
The man knocked at a small side door. As it opened, it briefly
revealed a bloodied tile floor with other animals _ the
slaughterhouse of the mosque, where supplicants left their gifts.
</P>
<P>
   You can spend days in the medina because even the prepared mind
cannot absorb all its scenes and the many tales that make up its
history. There are numerous medieval foundouks _ the old
caravansaries or inns _ that are now fraying bazaars and
warehouses. There are the finely decorated medersas, or theological
colleges, where young men have been staying since the Middle Ages.
</P>
<P>
   The newly opened Nejjarine Museum of Wood and Carpentry, once an
18th-century foundouk, is now beautifully restored. Apart from its
interesting collection, it shows the sophistication of a Fassi
mansion, with its inner courtyard, its decor of intricate stucco,
the finely carved panels of cedar and the mosaics and layouts of
tiles.
</P>
<P>
   The museum also offers one of the medina's few points of rest, a
lovely rooftop cafe, with a view of the puzzle around you. In the
Mellah, the old Jewish quarter, the Aban Danan synagogue, dating
from the 17th century and newly restored, has a handsome cedar
ceiling and handmade green and white tiles. The Royal Palace, on
one side of the Mellah, is strictly off limits, but it is worth
roaming around the elegant public square.
</P>
<P>
   The second day, my guide in the medina was Fatima El Majdoubi,
who offered a different perspective. She showed me a hammam, a
public bath for women, a sure way to delve into the local life.
This place of tepid and hot steam rooms was filled with the
neighborhood's women and children. Upon request, hefty attendants
rub you down with brown soap and administer sturdy massages. (Take
towels.)
</P>
<P>
   Fatima also decoded the spice market. It is spread out on a
pretty square, before the Maristan, built in 1268. A plaque on its
wall states that it probably served ``as a model for the first
psychiatric hospital in the Western world, opened in Valencia,
Spain, in 1410.'' Until the hospital closed half a century ago,
Fatima said, musicians regularly came to play to calm the patients.
A soothing thought, to be wrapped in music.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, the stalls were loaded with pumice, kohl and tablets of
ghasoul, a shampoo made of ground stone mixed with rose essence. We
saw the spices for Morocco's extraordinary cuisine, for its
tagines, or stews, and that great Fassi delicacy, the pastilla, or
pigeon pie with almonds. Cinnamon bark is a key ingredient, and, so
the story goes, harem women rubbed it on their bodies before
visiting their master.
</P>
<P>
   I have drawn some modest conclusions from this first visit to
Fez: one is to waste no time on the nouvelle ville, the ``modern''
quarter that the French built early this century. It is a noisy
jumble of fatigued cement, car exhaust, cafes, hotels and villas
for the well to do. Another recommendation is to absorb as many
layers as possible of the rich medina first and set aside separate
time for shopping, perhaps at the potters' cooperatives on the edge
of town, or the Centre Artisanal, where prices are fixed, unless
you enjoy the ritual haggling that is required in the souk.
</P>
<P>
   A lovely place to end the day is on the bar terrace of the Hotel
Palais Jamai, a 19th-century mansion set above the medina. There,
you can watch the evening settle over the medieval roofs and hear
the chorus of muezzins calling for prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a short time, the magnetism of Fez becomes clear: Fez is
not worried about being relevant to the modern world, or to
visitors. The old city has its rhythms of work, food and prayer, of
doors opening and closing. It is a way of life that, as in Venice,
happens on foot.
</P>
<P>
   The medina works because it exists for the local residents and
Moroccans elsewhere who rely on the city's craftsmen. The tourist
is tolerated, barely noticed. The medina is absorbed in its age-old
work.

COPPOLA LOOKING FOR ATTENTION  
 NEW RELEASES OF VIDEO CASSETTES: REVIEWS BY NEW YORK TIMES
CRITICS  
 BEST-SELLERS SHOW GROWING STRENGTH OF DVD 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AN `AUDITION' FOR COPPOLA: Francis Ford Coppola said he hoped
the DVD of his film ``Apocalypse Now,'' released this week by
Paramount, makes a good impression. Not that the director feels in
need of critical stroking, but he hopes the production work on the
disc catches attention because it was performed by the DVD
laboratory he has started at American Zoetrope, his film company in
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The lab transfers films to disc, and Coppola is offering one of
his own as an example of the kind of work Zoetrope does, both for
his films and the work of others. ```Apocalypse' was kind of an
audition for us to determine if we can do our other things as
well,'' he said. ``I'm hoping they'll allow us to do the
`Godfather' films.'' Like ``Apocalypse Now,'' those three movies
are also owned by Paramount, which, like other studios, distributes
the videos but farms out the technical transfer work to others.
</P>
<P>
   Coppola wants studios and filmmakers to engage Zoetrope for the
process called ``authoring,'' or the analysis of a movie to
determine how digital information can be added or deleted in each
scene to make it the strongest for the home screen. If a scene has
an empty spot or two, some of its information might be shifted to
strengthen busier areas of the scene. ``It's a psychological and
artistic decision on where to spend your little digital pennies,''
Coppola said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are a lot of pennies to spend on a DVD, which
has oceans of space. That's true overall, he said, but not
necessarily within particular scenes that may need different
allocation. ``So we say let's spend them here because that's where
the filmmaker wants the beauty or the luster or the detail to be.''
</P>
<P>
   While Coppola prefers the theater screen, video is a reality.
``Of all the people who see your work, 90 percent of them will see
it on some sort of home electronics video medium,'' he said. ``With
these new sound systems and plasma screens, little by little the
home experience is edging up to a more theatrical-style
exhibition.''
</P>
<P>
   Filmmakers, he said, are invited to go to Zoetrope and take part
in the transfer of their films. ``I want a hand in my own films, so
that's how this happened,'' he said. Typically, he added, directors
don't get involved. Such was the case when his film ``Bram Stoker's
Dracula'' (1992) was transferred in the early days of DVD. ``No one
called me and said, `Hey, take a look at this master,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At American Zoetrope, the emphasis is on the transfer, not on
the extra features that crowd other top-of-the-line discs. ``The
master is vital,'' Coppola said. ``You have to get it right because
that's the way it will be passed along.'' On the disc of
``Apocalypse Now'' there are few extras and only a short director's
commentary, in which Coppola explains why he rejected an alternate
ending to the film.
</P>
<P>
   A full commentary was never his intention. ``I would have wanted
to go back to the earliest cut,'' he said, meaning a longer version
that hadn't been through postproduction and therefore hadn't been
mixed or scored. ``If we had gone to that length, it would have
been too much time and money,'' he said. ``It tends to be like the
string on your socks.''

a little something to tamper with everybody's affections. ``But,''
Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, ``there's no magic in the
potion to banish the film's awkwardness or make it more than a
string of intermittent acting highlights.''

   West is the U.S. marshal James West (Will Smith), who is
dispatched by President Ulysses S. Grant to apprehend the
mechanical genius and master fiend Dr. Arliss Loveless (Kenneth
Branagh). On his way to Utah, West teams with Artemus Gordon (Kevin
Kline), who rides in his lavish railroad car knitting bulletproof
vests. Having lost his body from the waist down, Loveless propels
himself around in a steam-powered wheelchair and commands a
gigantic mechanical spider. Unfortunately, though, Barry
Sonnenfeld's film ``leaves reality so far behind that its
storytelling would be arbitrary even by comic-book standards''
(Maslin).

   The dwelling of the title may be a dilapidated eyesore built on
toxic landfill, but Darryl Kerrigan (Michael Caton), a
happy-go-lucky Australian tow-truck driver, fights to save his home
from demolition. A sentimentalized version of a John Waters family,
the wacky Kerrigans _ Darryl, his wife and four children _ revel in
the sheer tackiness of the place, which is a veritable palace
compared to his summer retreat under high-voltage lines by a grim
little lake. ``If `The Castle' is essentially a one-joke movie, the
sheer giddy stamina with which it insists on the Kerrigans' joie de
vivre keeps it afloat'' (Stephen Holden).

   An attractive divorced woman in her 40s (Kate Capshaw) finds a
mysterious love letter, addressed to no one, tucked in her mail.
Her erotic imagination in overdrive, she imagines it has been sent
by a 20-year-old college student (Tom Everett Scott), whom she
lures into a passionate affair. But then a nice and more
age-appropriate suitor (Tom Selleck) begins hanging around. What's
not so wonderful about this slender wisp of a movie is its ``bland
dialogue and dull sitcom acting'' (Holden).

`ONE SPECIAL NIGHT': ANDREWS IS FLINTY AND GARNER IS STUBBORN.
PERFECT. 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(DW) 
 By RON WERTHEIMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``One Special Night,'' the film that reunites Julie Andrews and
James Garner, lives up to its title. These dependable performers
can still generate enough sparks to warm two hours on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Time (and other interventions) may have rearranged their
familiar faces a little, but these actors can slip so easily into
their expected personas _ she's a bit too flinty for her own good;
he's a bit too pigheaded for his _ that you'll be charmed.
</P>
<P>
   CBS has wisely found the stars a script about opposites
attracting, one that subtly nudges memories of the pair's two
movies, ``The Americanization of Emily'' in 1964 and
``Victor/Victoria'' in 1982. This film cannot stack up to those,
and it doesn't try to. But it does offer a sweet tale of autumnal
romance that your heart will believe. (Give your head the night
off.)
</P>
<P>
   The movie is winningly directed by Roger Young. The script, by
Nancy Silvers (which opens up the play ``A Winter Visitor'' by Jan
Hartman), begins on a frosty Thanksgiving in a picturesque town
that's covered with snow and Christmas wreaths. Ms. Andrews plays
Dr. Catherine Howard, a pediatric cardiologist still grieving for
her husband, who died a year before. Garner is Robert Woodward, a
building contractor whose wife, suffering from Alzheimer's, can no
longer recognize him.
</P>
<P>
   They meet at a hospice where they are both seeking connections
to the past, the place where Catherine's husband died and Robert's
wife is dying. A whopping snowstorm kicks up, and Robert can't get
a cab home.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine considers offering him a lift, then warns herself,
``Don't do this.'' She rejects her own advice, of course, and after
telling her boorishly that she's pretty dumb to be driving a Jaguar
in the snow, he accepts her offer. He doesn't like the way she
drives or the classical music on her radio. She doesn't like his
chauvinist attitude. When they skid off the road and get stuck in a
snow bank, he orders her to wait in the car. She fires back: ``You
go hunt and gather. I'll knit something for the harvest.''
</P>
<P>
   What luck! They find a comfy, well-equipped and unoccupied cabin
in which they can wait out the night by the fire, swap life stories
and discover that they have nothing in common but a primal need for
human contact.
</P>
<P>
   She confesses her regret at never having children. He reminds
her how many young lives she has saved. He confesses his heartbreak
that his wife has forgotten him. Catherine says, ``In her soul a
woman never forgets a man who has occupied her life for so long.''
</P>
<P>
   In their isolation, they develop a bond, slim but strong. You
can see it form in their eyes, hear it in their changing tones of
voice. These scenes, with just Ms. Andrews and Garner on screen,
are the film's generous payoff.
</P>
<P>
   There is more to the movie, but, happily, not too much more.
Subplots focus on Robert's dippy daughters (one of whom is
extremely pregnant), his whiny son-in-law and his
greeting-card-cute grandson. Yes, the whole enterprise is more than
a bit manipulative. (Toward the end, that plaintive saxophone solo
of ``Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas'' qualifies as cruel
and unusual punishment.) But the flaws are easy to overlook.
</P>
<P>
   There must be people who have no fond memories of Ms. Andrews,
Garner or various mooshy-hearted holiday films, and those who do
not believe in the redeeming power of love. They are advised to
keep the clicker handy. Everybody else, put your feet up and relax
by the fire.
</P>
<P>
   RICKY MARTIN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Need a bit of a workout after all that turkey and whatnot? Well,
here's an idea. Watch Ricky Martin Friday night, and try to do
everything he does. When he jumps, you jump. When he wiggles, you
wiggle. Or you can sit down. Either way, you may have fun, although
you probably won't have as much fun as he seems to be having.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't know that Martin is one of the hottest pop stars in
the world, where have you been?
</P>
<P>
   In Friday night's hour, he sings some of his familiar hits _
``Livin' la Vida Loca,'' ``She's All I Ever Had,'' ``Maria,''
``Shake Your Bon-Bon'' _ before a deliriously happy outdoor crowd
at Liberty State Park in Jersey City, with the Manhattan skyline as
a backdrop. For one medley Martin, who proudly extols his Puerto
Rican heritage, is joined by two Latin music legends, Carlos
Santana and Jose Feliciano.
</P>
<P>
   The show is slickly packaged, with lots of changing camera
angles and a stage full of lithe bon-bon-shaking dancers. But
viewers who are used to Martin's dynamic videos may find the
proceedings a bit static. His boyish comments about how thrilled he
is with his success come across as a bit too gee-whiz for an
international icon.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his evident delight is hard to resist. And even if you
are sitting down, when he smiles, you smile.

JOHN LEWIS: `EVOLUTION' 
</HEADLINE>
   By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are some statements that can't be made in youth, and
``Evolution'' (Atlantic), the new solo piano album from John Lewis,
the former Modern Jazz Quartet pianist, is one of them.
``Evolution,'' programmed with jazz standards and some of Lewis'
compositions, captures the burned-off essence of his style _ which
is full of straightforward elements, major harmonies and two-note
chords _ in a context of shifting rhythm. The album was recorded in
a concert hall without an audience, a production technique that
favors his light touch and his even legato. It's a good album for
the stillness of winter.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has applied as much thought to the arrangement of these
songs as he would if he were playing with a group, and then made a
music that's utterly at peace with itself.
</P>
<P>
   A little bit after the model of Baroque preludes, he introduces
a concise melodic or rhythmic motif at the beginning of each track,
then he brings that motif to bear on the tunes and improvisations
that follow. When he becomes expansive, it feels like a
well-considered choice: there's a 32-bar stretch in his performance
of ``September Song'' that lifts up out of the quiet, wintry
surroundings; suddenly he goes into four-four time, uses strides
and accents, moves around thicker chords, plays blues figures that
try to bend keyboard notes. And then the music returns to serenity,
the album's overriding quality.

FOR CHIC'S SAKE, JAPANESE WOMEN PARADE TO THE ORTHOPEDIST  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CALVIN SIMS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ A few weeks ago, Tomomi Okawa, a 25-year-old office
clerk, was driving home from shopping when she crashed into a
concrete pole, killing a friend who was riding in the passenger
seat.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Okawa, who sustained head injuries, told the police that she
could not brake properly because she was wearing six-inch high-heel
boots that have become the latest fashion rage among young Japanese
women.
</P>
<P>
   Three months ago, thick-soled shoes were blamed for the death of
Misayo Shimizu, a nursery school employee, who police said tripped
while wearing sandals with four-inch cork soles and fractured her
skull.
</P>
<P>
   For many Japanese, these deaths were an alarm signal of the
dangers posed by wearing shoes with elevated soles, which only a
few years ago were four inches but are now often eight inches. The
elevated shoes come in a wide variety of styles, ranging from hot
pink sandals for summer to black leather boots for winter. The
shoes cost between $70 and $200. Sales of platform shoes in Japan
are estimated to be $100 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite stumbling down stairs, slipping on pavement, and
tripping over their own feet, many Japanese young women said in
recent interviews that they were willing to risk the twisted
ankles, broken bones, scuffed knees, bruised faces, and other
dangers associated with wearing the trendy platform shoes.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I've fallen and twisted my ankle many times, but they are so
cute that I won't give them up until they go out of fashion,'' said
Miwako Kimura, 15, who was wearing beige corduroy boots with
six-inch block soles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like them because they make me tall and make my legs look
long and shapely,'' said Aiko Kiuchi, whose black six-inch-sole
boots allow her to stand 5 feet 6 inches tall. ``You can't imagine
how great it feels to see the world from this height.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at the Tsukiji Seikotsuin Orthopedics Clinic said in a
recent interview that the number of women visiting the clinic for
treatment of injuries sustained while wearing thick-soled shoes had
increased 20 percent in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   One patient, who sprained her ankle last year but continues to
wear the platform shoes, was asked if she was not afraid of falling
again. I am only 5 feet tall, she said, ``but with thick-soled
shoes I look better.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``In the commuter train, the level of my eyes is
higher than middle-aged men, who are so arrogant in the office.''
</P>
<P>
   As the number of injuries involving high-soled shoes increases
so has the government's concern. The Japan Consumer Information
Center, a government-financed agency, has issued a report warning
the public of the dangers the shoes pose and giving tips on ways to
prevent accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The possibility of falling is great because of their
instability,'' Dr. Yoshiro Musha, chief of orthopedics at Omori Red
Cross Hospital, wrote in the consumer report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shoes are not appropriate for walking for a long periods
or for running,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the masses of people in Shibuya, a bustling district of
Tokyo known for its night life, hundreds of young women tower above
the crowds, aided by platform shoes, which often weigh as much as
three pounds each, making walking extremely cumbersome.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these young women look as if they are about to topple,
as they proceed ever so slowly with calculated, small steps. Some
of them do not hesitate to grab the shoulder of a friend or a
passerby to maintain their balance.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly disturbing to many Japanese are the number of young
women who wear the elevated shoes while attending to their babies.
After seeing a young mother clad in thick-soled sandals carrying a
baby down subway stairs, Yoko Togashi, a salaried worker, was so
outraged that he wrote a letter to the editor of Yomiuri Shimbun.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is free to wear any type of shoes to injure herself by
falling, but how can she put the baby at risk?'' Togashi said.
``Regretting after losing the baby is too late. She should use her
brain more.''
</P>
<P>
   Teruko Ishii, a professor at Aoba Gakuen Junior College, whose
research focuses on clothing-related health issues, conducted a
poll of women students at her college and found that 23 percent had
fallen while wearing thick-soled shoes. Nearly half of those who
fell suffered fractures or other serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ishii said the young Japanese women who wear platform shoes
resemble the oiran, a type of high-class prostitute of the Edo
period (1603-1868). The oiran were known for their public
processions in which they wore spectacular kimonos and high clogs
called takageta. Attendants accompanied the oiran to help them
maintain balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, the young woman are walking just like the oiran, but
that doesn't seem to bother them,'' Ms. Hanada said. ``They are so
intrigued by fashion that they cannot judge whether or not these
shoes are practical.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerned that the rising number of injuries could lead to
lawsuits, platform shoe manufacturers, which are mainly in the
Nagata area of Kobe, have started attaching warning labels to the
shoes.
</P>
<P>
   One company's label reads: ``Because the heels of the shoes are
high, please be careful when you run or go up and down the stairs.
Be especially careful when you drink because you can be wobbly. We,
the producers, will be very happy if you keep these points in mind
when you enjoy the trendy fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Many young women say they wear the shoes despite the objections
of their parents and boyfriends, who dislike it when their
girlfriends can look down on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having big feet used to be shameful for women, but a
turnaround has occurred,'' a fashion writer, Ririko Amakasu, said

   BEIJING _ At least 119 people are dead and more than 150 missing
after a ferry in stormy seas burned and broke apart off China's
northeastern coast, official news media reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday night, according to differing accounts from the
shipping company and the New China News Agency, either 22 or 36
survivors had been found from the ship, which that had been
carrying 312 passengers and crew members.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen-foot waves and freezing temperatures hampered the rescue
effort near the port city of Yantai, in Shandong province. A
helicopter, dozens of ships and thousands of soldiers and residents
along the shoreline joined in the search for survivors from the
wreck, which occurred about one-and-a-half miles offshore, the news
agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The ship, which belonged to the Yanda Ferry Company in Shandong,
left Yantai on Wednesday afternoon for what is normally a
seven-to-eight-hour journey 100 miles north to the city of Dalian.
</P>
<P>
   It was forced to turn back because of the extreme conditions,
but then around 4:30 p.m. Wednesday, flames were discovered on the
second deck, and the ship sent out a distress signal, the news
agency said. The wind and waves prevented other ships from
immediately approaching.
</P>
<P>
   Some four hours later, apparently engulfed by fire, the ship
began drifting. That evening it apparently started to break up, and
at least parts of it sank, according to the New China News Agency.
</P>
<P>
   One survivor, a 28-year-old man, told the French news agency
Agence France-Presse that around 4 p.m. Wednesday, all the
passengers rushed to the upper deck because of heavy smoke from
below, where some 60 cars were making the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided to jump into the water because the smoke was so
strong it was hard to breathe,'' he said, adding that he and five
other men had jumped at once. He lost track of the others and swam
for an hour, he said, before reaching the shore.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials said many bodies had washed ashore, along with a
few people who were found unconscious but still alive.
</P>
<P>
   According to local news media, this was the second accident in
five weeks for a vessel operated by Yanda Ferry Co. In October, a
ship caught fire and sank near Dalian, but all but three people
were rescued.

<P>
   ASSISI, Italy _ When a powerful earthquake crushed the vaulted
ceiling of the Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi two years ago, the
damage to priceless 13th- and 14th-century frescos was so
devastating that it overshadowed the loss of 11 lives and many
thousands of homes.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the basilica, one of the most revered shrines of the
Roman Catholic Church, will be fully reopened to the public. The
extraordinary restoration of the early Renaissance masterpiece was
so speedy and efficient that it has been dubbed ``the miracle of
Assisi.''
</P>
<P>
   But another expected miracle _ a free-market experiment in
disaster relief that was supposed to find new shelter for thousands
of victims within two years _ has not materialized. In the rolling
hills surrounding Assisi, medieval towns and mountain villages are
still dotted with makeshift camp sites, bleak rows of corrugated
metal huts that Italians call ``containers,'' which were hastily
erected to shelter many of the 40,000 people in Umbria and the
Marches left homeless by the 1997 earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10,000 people are still living in containers, looking
ahead to their third Christmas in crowded, 375-square-foot metal
boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them complain that the fate of the basilica monopolized
international attention and government concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you show the world the reconstructed basilica, people
will assume that the earthquake emergency is over,'' said Dante
Amici, the head of the Falling Star camp ground in Colfiorito, a
mountain village 24 miles from Assisi that was the epicenter of the
quake and one-fifth of whose 500 inhabitants live in containers.
``But in reality the emergency is still here, we are it.''
</P>
<P>
   The earthquake on Sept. 26, 1997, was by no means the most
devastating in recent history. The 1980 earthquake in Irpinia, near
Naples, left 2,500 dead and 300,000 homeless. That disaster remains
etched in the national psyche as an act of God made worse by human
greed: much of the $27 billion in state funds sent for
reconstruction was siphoned off by corrupt officials and local
organized crime. Even today, some Irpinia victims are still living
in containers.
</P>
<P>
   That and other bad experiences prompted the Italian government
to do two things. It proposed a law to mandate private earthquake
insurance, a deeply controversial innovation in a country where the
state is expected to provide in a catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   And immediately after the Assisi quake, the government passed a
measure to allot state funds directly to victims, to allow them to
hire their own contractors to rebuild their homes _ bypassing the
local authorities, lessening the opportunities for corruption and,
in theory, bulldozing through bureaucracy and speeding up the
reconstruction process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The model presupposes the fashionable view that the less
government the better,'' said Vincenzo Riommi, deputy mayor of
Foligno, a regional center that was also badly hit by the quake.
``People could chose their own builders and take responsibility for
themselves instead of waiting for the state to do everything. But
what we didn't foresee in this free market system is that supply
and demand would end up so imbalanced.''
</P>
<P>
   Overnight, there were several thousand people in need of new
homes. The regional council of Umbria drew a list of 570 companies
that could execute the plans. But most of the contracts ended up
going to fewer than than 100 companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We relied on private initiative, the desire of individual
homeowners to build as soon as possible,'' said Bruno Bracalente,
president of the Umbria regional government. ``But people had
different reactions. They hired contractors and architects the way
they choose family doctors, somebody they knew and trusted.''
</P>
<P>
   That backlog was compounded by bureaucratic delays in inspecting
sites, approving blueprints and granting building permits. ``Italy
is the land of paper,'' complained Giuliano Ricci, head of the
Colfiorito reconstruction committee. ``Every time you try to
present your building proposal, they ask you for your social
security number 50 times.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor has fraud been totally eliminated from the process. The
police in Foligno announced this week that they had uncovered a
scam by a phony construction company that bilked both suppliers and
homeowners for just over $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1998, Bracalente confidently predicted that 4,500
dislocated families would be back in their own homes within 12
months. Now he concedes that it could take several more years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the repair of the Basilica of St. Francis proved a
model of speed and almost superhuman cooperation. Friars,
government bureaucrats, art restorers, construction crews and
hundreds of volunteers worked around the clock to bolster the
structure against future quakes and to reconstruct the vault of the
nave, famous for its brilliantly colored frescos by Giotto and
Cimabue. The images of only two saints, St. Rufino and St.
Vittorino, traditionally attributed to Giotto, were reconstituted
by piecing together more than 3,000 tiny fragments like pieces of a
jigsaw puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   And even many of the people left homeless by the same disaster
say the basilica deserved priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's St. Francis, and it is also the main draw for tourism
around here _ they had to fix it first,'' said Giovanni Polveri,
21, who has spent the last two years in a container in Foligno with
his parents and sister. He said his contractor had so many other
commissions that his reconstruction permits had not yet been
processed. ``There is nothing we can do, but we are very sick of
living in this place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The state has spent $39 million on the basilica and the Sacred
Convent attached to it, but that expense is small compared with the
$5 billion it has earmarked over the same time to reconstruct
ruined homes, churches and historic buildings.
</P>
<P>
   By Italian standards, however, the pace is exemplary. It took
three years for the first reconstruction sites to go up after the
earthquake in Friuli in 1976, and 12 years to rehouse all 80,000
victims, a vast public works project that is considered a model
compared with Irpinia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly having these many families still in containers is a
problem,'' Bracalente said. ``But in reality, things are moving
very fast: in Umbria alone, we now have 4,500 open construction
sites. Many should be finished by spring.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet many small communities are less sanguine. They are using
some state funds to throw up apartment buildings to offer better
housing to residents stuck in containers. Once their own homes are
finally reconstructed, those new buildings will be turned into
public housing.
</P>
<P>
   After the quake, the homeless were given the option of receiving
government assistance to rent temporary housing, about $140 per
person a month with a ceiling of $330 per family. Or they could
move into containers, supplied for free, with discounted utility
charges. In larger towns like Foligno, most people chose the rental
money. Many who chose containers were immigrant workers who viewed
the boxes as an improvement over the crowded tenements they lived
in before the quake.
</P>
<P>
   In rural areas, however, there were very few apartments
available to rent, and almost all chose containers that allowed
them to stay near their farms, herds of cattle and jobs. After two
years, most camp grounds have their own makeshift playgrounds,
satellite dishes, metal chapels and cafes, and look eerily settled
_ like lunar colonies plunked down on pastures and potato fields.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the inhabitants are elderly villagers, passively waiting
to be told what to do. But there are also young couples who felt
they had no better choice. ``I couldn't keep my job and commute
from an apartment,'' said Marcello Massimiani, 31, who works as a
butcher in Colfiorito, 15 miles from Foligno, the nearest large
town.
</P>
<P>
   While they wait for an apartment, he and his wife, Monica, and
their 7-month-old twins live in a container they fixed up with lace
curtains, a television and microwave, squeezing two cribs next to
their bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first two months, we lived in a tent, so this seemed
luxurious,'' Mrs. Massimiani said with a smile. ``That wore off
once the twins came.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she had adjusted to the cramped living quarters and
solitary walks across muddy camp grounds with her double-stroller.
``We have to live with it, and so we got used to it, this is our
reality, but we don't have any idea when it will end,'' she said,
adding with a grimace, ``I dread the day the twins start to walk.''

 By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ It was the 53rd day of the school year at Joyce Kilmer
Elementary, a fact that was hardly lost on Christine Jabbari.
</P>
<P>
   That's because ``Day: 053'' was printed at the top of the
recommended lesson plan open on her desk, a thick white binder
crammed with goals for each day, conversation starters and
step-by-step questions that had been given to her and the city's
26,000 other teachers by the school system's administrators at the
start of the school year.
</P>
<P>
   And in case the document's importance was lost on Ms. Jabbari,
the page also identified the section of the Iowa Test of Basic
Skills to which that day's entry corresponded _ even though Ms.
Jabbari's 48 kindergartners will not take the standardized test,
which determines who may be held back, until the end of the first
grade.
</P>
<P>
   Like an explorer following a map to buried treasure, Ms. Jabbari
proceeded to guide her pupils through that day's lesson, which, at
the city's prodding, centered on a story about a child's bath, in
which the letter ``b'' figured prominently.
</P>
<P>
   When her instructions suggested that Ms. Jabbari advise the
children to ``think of other pictures that make the same sound bath
begins with,'' she complied, telling them, ``I want you to raise
your hand and give me words that start with the `ba' sound.''
</P>
<P>
   Although almost every American school district has begun, in
just the last three years, to check student progress against
specified academic standards, the United States' third-largest
district has gone a giant step further this year: supplying every
teacher with a virtual script, a detailed, day-by-day outline of
what he or she should be teaching _ and when _ in the language
arts, mathematics, science and social studies.
</P>
<P>
   The standardized lesson plans, which were drafted over two years
by a committee of 100 teachers, are optional. But central
administrators, most notably the system's chief executive, Paul
Vallas, have made clear that all teachers should draw on the
lessons in some way _ and many apparently are doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Informal surveys by several principals and the leaders of the
teachers union suggest that several thousand teachers have already
begun incorporating the curriculums into the daily fiber of their
classrooms, often following the instructions word for word.
</P>
<P>
   The program, believed to be the most comprehensive of its kind,
is being tracked by educators across the country, at a time when
the pedagogical pendulum is swinging away from the free-form,
anything-goes instruction of the 1970s and 1980s, and toward a
regimented style more reminiscent of the 1950s. (Even in the 1950s,
though, lessons were rarely orchestrated down to the day.)
</P>
<P>
   In scaling back teachers' autonomy, Chicago is building on
smaller experiments in dozens of other districts, which have
encouraged the use of a choreographed, drill-oriented curriculum
called ``Success for All'' in reading classes in its
lowest-performing schools, as well as a similar program in a new
charter school.
</P>
<P>
   To some educators, curriculums like Chicago's are the logical
complement to the standards movement, providing an almost ironclad
guarantee that all students will be exposed to the same material
and that all teachers, regardless of qualification, will know
exactly how to present it .
</P>
<P>
   ``I think creativity had just gotten out of hand,'' said
Johnetta James, who has been principal at Kilmer Elementary on
Chicago's North Side for a decade, and who has mandated that her
teachers use the new curriculum in English and math.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, Ms. James recalled walking into a second grade
``reading'' class, only to find students filling the blackboard
with a simple bar graph charting the number of cans raised in a
food drive. (``They're learning how to read a graph,'' Ms. James
quoted the teacher as saying.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jabbari, 31, a six-year veteran who must corral four dozen
kindergartners each day, said the new lesson plans had been
invaluable in helping her avoid such moments. And she was one of
many teachers interviewed _ including Tom Reece, president of the
Chicago Teachers Union _ who were impressed with the quality of the
lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``You come into class,'' Ms. Jabbari said, ``and you know what
you're going to teach.''
</P>
<P>
   But to others, Chicago is sapping the creativity from the
teaching process, with some teachers reduced to being robots who
have one eye trained on the test calendar and the other on a
suggested list of talking points, exercises and questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger in scripting teachers,'' said Judith Rizzo, the
deputy chancellor for curriculum and instruction for the New York
City schools, ``is that people will say: `I followed the script.
It's not my fault that the kids didn't learn.'''
</P>
<P>
   Others worry that by having so much of their time spoken for,
teachers might be reluctant to be spontaneous _ for example, to
turn the tables and allow their students to teach. ``Good teachers
are open to the moment,'' said Roberta Grabler, who has taught
elementary school for 25 years in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago lesson plans, known as the ``structured
curriculum,'' were largely the idea of Vallas, the peripatetic
former city budget director who was entrusted with the keys to the
school system in 1995 when it was taken over by Mayor Richard M.
Daley.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure, Vallas has instituted sweeping changes,
including holding back tens of thousands of students, that have
already begun to lift the system above its perennial, rock-bottom
national rating.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Vallas said he had found his inspiration for
the daily lesson plans in an unlikely place: the officers' training
manuals that he had received from the National Guard during more
than a decade as a reservist.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Vallas envisions a school system with far more
flexibility than one might expect. He encourages teachers, for
example, to bounce around as they sample the lesson plans, fusing
the elements of several days' lessons into one class and lingering
on others for a week, if they like.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover committees are already at work on two alternate
curriculums to fulfill Vallas' dream that some day soon, each
teacher will begin the day standing at the fork of three very
different paths. How much those lessons will vary, however, remains
to be seen.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Some critics out there will say, `Oh my God, you're
lobotomizing teachers,''' Vallas said. ``No. What we're saying is
`What every major successful corporation is doing, what the
military is doing, is giving teachers a model of quality
instruction and curriculum so they'll feel supported in the
classroom.'''
</P>
<P>
   For all that hand-holding, Vallas refuses to soften the sting of
the standardized tests to which the curriculum is linked. Last
summer, for example, two out of every three students in the third
and sixth grades were required to attend summer school in Chicago _
and half of those who attended were required to repeat the grade.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of retention, which hangs like a cloud over every
elementary and middle school, has made for some strange-sounding
conversations this year at Kilmer Elementary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iowa, Iowa, Iowa! We're in Iowa!'' Joanne Turko bellowed at
her sixth-graders one morning in early November in response to a
wrong answer during a 90-minute English lesson. ``That's where
they'll nail you on the Iowa test!''
</P>
<P>
   During the class, Ms. Turko, who has been teaching for 30 years,
had her city-provided lesson notebook open on her desk. The goals
of the day that Ms. Turko scribbled on the blackboard were lifted
almost verbatim from the city's daily lesson plans; where she
wrote, ``Make inferences and draw conclusions,'' the book
suggested, ``Draw conclusions, deduce meaning not explicitly
stated.'.
</P>
<P>
   But in an example of the flexibility encouraged by Vallas, Ms.
Turko had cobbled together her lesson from days eight and 49, even
though it was day 53, in a lively lesson that she made her own by
having her students ask one another questions to compare the Great
Wall of China with the wall built by the Roman Emperor Hadrian.
</P>
<P>
   Though her students said that they had little idea that she was
teaching from what, in a sense, is a lot like a cookbook, they said
they had noticed that Ms. Turko invoked the Iowa test all day long
_ and that the threats of their failure had succeeded in keeping
them hanging on her every word, scripted or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally I wouldn't pay much attention, because I'd know I
could pass without doing much work,'' said Jason Olivares, 12, who
sat front row center. ``It's not like that now. I know I've got to
study harder and learn so that I can go on to the seventh grade _
and life.''

<P>
   BURAO, Somalia _ It has been nearly nine years since the people
of northwest Somalia gathered here to declare themselves separate
from the chaos of the rest of their country. They created a
government. They rebuilt their villages and businesses. A young
veterinarian named Mohammed Nur Arale saw enough peace recently to
invest in a luxury unknown in this town since 1988: a gas station
with a pump that actually works.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mentality of the people is not the same,'' he said. ``Now
everyone has put down their arms. Everyone was just fed up with all
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The self-proclaimed Republic of Somaliland has become one of
Africa's fledgling success stories _ but a success the outside
world has been reluctant to help because no one is quite sure what
to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   Somaliland presents a quandary because it wants to be recognized
as an independent nation. Its people argue that this would
acknowledge their land as an island of peace separate from Somalia,
a country so lawless that Kofi Annan, the U.N. secretary-general,
recently referred to it as a ``black hole.''
</P>
<P>
   African leaders hold few notions as sacred as the usually
arbitrary borders drawn by and inherited from their European
colonial rulers, because those frontiers define their power. But in
this case, if Somaliland _ whose desired borders exactly mirror
those of an old British protectorate _ becomes independent, what
might happen to the borders of Nigeria, whose vast territory is
riven by ethnic and religious differences? Or to Congo, Sudan and
Angola, where competing factions and countries have exploited civil
wars to carve fiefs that are essentially self-contained states?
</P>
<P>
   Is Africa to go the way of the old Yugoslavia, or Indonesia,
where violence and strivings for independence have redrawn
frontiers and led to new states?
</P>
<P>
   And so, with another round of peace talks on the whole of
Somalia scheduled to begin this month, Somaliland is caught in what
its foreign minister calls a ``twilight zone,'' in which it exists
in nearly every way as its own state, but survives on a mere
trickle of foreign aid and cannot get access to international loans
or banks.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the world, and the United States in particular, has
done its best to forget Somalia since 1993. That year, 24
peacekeepers were killed in an ambush in June and, four months
later, 18 U.S. servicemen died in a battle in Mogadishu during the
U.N. effort to bring food and stability to a starving Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, which had entered Somalia with great fanfare
in 1992, proclaiming this the sort of intervention that would
define the new world order that was supposed to follow the Cold
War, pulled out soon after those killings. So did the United
Nations. Outside help dried up to nearly nothing. And Somalia
became a symbol for anarchy, the disaster of misplaced foreign aid
_ and an example of how costly it can be for the West to intervene
in conflicts it does not understand.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a new consensus has begun to emerge among many outside
nations and certainly among Somalis themselves: Something needs to
be done.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, that is the view of people in Somaliland, from
businessmen like Mohammed Ahmed Barji, who trades in television
sets, generators and mopeds and must load up suitcases with up to
$50,000 in cash to go on buying trips abroad, to its president,
Mohammed Ibrahim Egal, who says simply: ``We want to be let in from
the cold.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After nine years we feel frozen,'' Egal, 69, a big man with a
gray goatee, said in an interview. ``Today it is a question of
pride sustaining them,'' he said of the 2 million people of
Somaliland. ``But it may not be that way in five years. How much
longer will they be able to be sustained by pride but on an empty
stomach?''
</P>
<P>
   For the outside world, there is another motive to attempt to
restore something resembling order to Somalia, which has been
without a central government since 1991, when the dictatorship of
Siad Barre was overthrown after 22 years of misrule and an
interminable civil war. The warlords and militias _ though
substantially weakened _ continue to block peace.
</P>
<P>
   In this power vacuum, diplomats and other experts say, Somalia
is becoming a center for Islamic fundamentalism, for the smuggling
of arms and drugs and the export of terrorism. Parts of the bombs
that exploded in August 1998 at the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania reportedly passed through Somalia, as did the bombings'
suspected mastermind, Osama bin Laden, supposedly sometime later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We share the concerns that this place is in a state of chaos
and is definitely a breeding ground for all kinds of trouble,''
said one U.S. official.
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly how the rest of Somalia is viewed by the people
of Somaliland, who consider themselves different from the south.
</P>
<P>
   Since the days of colonialism _ when the Somali people were
divided into five different states _ Somaliland has had its own
history: Until 1960, it was a British protectorate. Although it
united with the Italian Somali colony four days after independence,
creating modern Somalia, Somaliland was never happy with the
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   So in 1991, after Barre fell, a group of elders, intellectuals
and other leaders came to this town to create the independent
Somaliland republic. Progress was slow _ two civil wars were fought
since then _ but over time the clan militias disarmed. The people
created an unusual parliament, mixing democracy with the
traditional leadership of elders and clans.
</P>
<P>
   And Somaliland has largely been blessed with peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was fighting five years ago and lots of banditry,'' said
Muhammad Ahmed, 34, who calls out prayers in the biggest mosque in
Hargeysa. ``But it has completely changed. It's like the difference
between the ground and the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed Abdi Edan, 30, said he could never find work during the
years of war. But in 1995 he got a job as an English teacher in
Hargeysa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really do think it is peace that let me find a job,'' he
said. ``Without peace you cannot live.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent day, he was wandering around downtown Hargeysa _
still littered with what is left of the buildings bombed by the
Barre government in 1988 _ to do a little investing: He was buying
up U.S. currency in the hope that it will rise against the
Somaliland shilling.
</P>
<P>
   That entrepreneurial spirit is perhaps the greatest strength of
the Somalilanders, half of whom still live as nomads with their
camels and goats.
</P>
<P>
   In a few years, businessmen there have created one of the
cheapest telephone systems in Africa: International calls are $1.50
a minute in the day and only 80 cents at night. Traders are working
to export frankincense and myrrh, and exploration has begun for oil
and gemstones.
</P>
<P>
   But the success of Somaliland rests on a shaky foundation. Its
greatest accomplishment is undoubtedly peace, though the price is
high: Over 70 percent of the national budget (itself only $20
million) goes to maintaining a huge army and police force _
composed of former militia members who have agreed not to fight
each other in return for their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves nothing for education, health or roads. Many Somalis
are thus becoming impatient with Egal and his government.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course they can do more,'' said Hussein Egeh, a 59-year-old
livestock trader who fled Somalia 20 years ago but has returned to
do business because of the peace in Somaliland. ``What is a
government for? When you have peace you don't just sit back.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, many in Somaliland distrust Egal, fearing that he may
compromise on Somaliland's independence _ and may, as many foreign
powers have urged him to do, find a way to reunite with the south.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will be the end of him, if he says we're going to the
south,'' said Ismail Hirsi, a 30-year-old street businessman who
changes as much $1,000 a day, money sent from Somalis living
abroad. ``He can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Egal argues that the answer to Somaliland's problems lies in
recognition from other nations, which would open the floodgates for
foreign aid and borrowing. As it stands, the United Nations and
European Union are the biggest investors in Somaliland's recovery,
but the money is ``peanuts,'' as one European aid worker put it.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On a recent trip abroad, Egal and his ministers argued their
case with senior officials in Italy, Libya and the United States.
They received lots of sympathy but little success. The
international community, Somaliland leaders say, has promised a
peace dividend for parts of Somalia that find stability. But
without recognition, Somaliland has been unable to get money from
institutions like the World Bank or the International Monetary
Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very generous in dishing out promises,'' the foreign
minister, Mahmoud Saleh Nour, said. ``But very stingy in
delivering.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Both Annan and American officials have discussed a kind of
compromise _ a special status, similar to the West Bank or Kosovo,
that would allow Somaliland to gain loans and more aid from outside
nations without full recognition. But that seems unlikely to happen
as long as a new peace initiative, led by the neighboring nation of
Djibouti, still holds promise.
</P>
<P>
   This initiative is different from previous efforts because it is
looking for leadership in the south, not among the warlords, but
from elders, intellectuals and women's groups as well as
businessmen and religious leaders. Still, few experts hold much
hope that even after nearly a decade of anarchy Somalia is ready to
find peace _ or that Somaliland will go along.
</P>
<P>
   And if these talks do not find answers, many experts say, it may
finally be time to think seriously about the question of
recognizing Somaliland. If Somaliland is not rewarded for its
accomplishments, they ask, what incentive does the rest of Somalia
_ and African countries beyond _ have for finding its own brand of
peace?
</P>
<P>
   ``If this thing fails,'' a European diplomat said, ``it means
that the international community has to go to some completely
different approach to Somalia.''

BUSINESS LOBBYISTS PLEASED WITH '98-99 CONGRESSIONAL SESSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democrats call it the do-nothing Congress, one that
failed to come to grips with issues like gun control, campaign
finance and Medicare coverage of prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans speak only slightly more favorably about the
congressional session that ended last week, saying they did as well
as could be expected given their narrow majorities in both houses
and a Democrat in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But lobbyists here for the main organizations representing large
numbers of businesses are downright enthusiastic. They managed,
they say, to get several important measures through Congress and
were able to block bills they opposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to do two things in the Congress,'' said Thomas
Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ``You try to
advance things of high importance and significance, and you try to
retard things that you don't want to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Baroody, chief lobbyist for the National Association of
Manufacturers, said he and the members of his organization were
disappointed that a big tax cut was not enacted this year, but he
added, ``We should not let the disappointments blind us to some
very significant accomplishments.''
</P>
<P>
   Many bills before Congress, like one that would require cable
companies to give Internet service providers access to high-speed
lines, were favored by some businesses and opposed by others. The
national business lobbies tended to sit those issues out.
</P>
<P>
   But these organizations had their way on a surprising number of
bills where businesses were more or less united.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant victory, say representatives of large
corporations and small businesses alike, was enactment of the law
that will limit lawsuits arising from Year 2000 computer
breakdowns. Many Democrats in Congress complained mightily when
President Clinton agreed to sign it.
</P>
<P>
   The substance of the law is important to businesses. It sets a
ceiling on punitive damages against small companies, gives all
companies a grace period to fix problems before they can be sued,
places particular limits on class-action suits and protects wealthy
companies against being held responsible for computer failures
caused by businesses with less resources.
</P>
<P>
   But lobbyists for industry said passage of the legislation was
perhaps even more important symbolically and politically because it
meant a victory in Congress for businesses over trial lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again in recent years, business interests and the trial
bar have been in fierce combat on the legislative battlefield _ on
product liability, on tobacco, on health maintenance organizations.
Each side has donated millions of dollars to lawmakers and
political parties. What was called the Y2K legislation amounted to
a rare knockout for the business side.
</P>
<P>
   The matter was so important to the Chamber of Commerce that the
organization spent more than $500,000 promoting the legislation in
television advertisements around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Donohue said this was just the beginning of a drive to bring
trial lawyers to their knees. ``We are going to continue to
challenge that very small group of people who are trying to suck
the vitality out of American industry and put it in their
pockets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Chamber of Commerce has vastly expanded its lobbying
operation in Washington. It now has 17 full-time lobbyists,
compared with only 3 when Donohue became president two years ago,
and the lobbying budget has been increased by millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The organization is also throwing much more muscle and money
into electoral politics. Donohue said it had plans to become
heavily involved in 35 to 40 House races and 10 to 12 Senate races
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other legislative victories for business this year was
the repeal of Depression-era laws that had limited the ability of
banks, securities firms and insurance companies to enter into one
another's businesses. The lobbies also won a five-year extension of
tax credits for businesses to help offset their research and
development expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Both of those measures passed because of unusual political
circumstances. The banking law was one of the rare pieces of big
legislation where the divisive issues were not partisan ones. And
on the popular research tax credit, the Republican chairmen of the
tax-writing committees may have allowed a long extension because
their own political circumstances have changed:
</P>
<P>
   To the consternation of business, Congress has insisted in the
past on approving the tax credit year by year, in large part
because that helped the lawmakers raise annual campaign donations
from business interests eager to have the tax break extended. But
now, Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee, is not running for re-election. And Senate Finance
Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del., 78, is running next year
for what is probably the last time and therefore is not likely to
need contributions again.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important to the business lobbyists was that a number of
measures they opposed did not become law: an increase in the
minimum wage, regulation of health care plans, limits on campaign
contributions, a ban on agribusiness mergers and a bill that would
have given many state and municipal statutes primacy over federal
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many measures favored by business interests were
rejected. Among them were bills that would have given the president
a freer hand to negotiate trade agreements, made it harder for
consumers to avoid paying debts by declaring bankruptcy and blocked
new rules by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration on
work-related injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest disappointment to many business interests was that
Congress did not enact a big tax cut. But tax reduction may not
have the same cachet it once had in business circles. Dirk Van
Dongen, president of the National Association of
Wholesaler-Distributors, said a poll of his members showed that
they overwhelmingly favored using the federal budget surplus for
debt reduction rather than tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Large-scale tax reduction is not likely to come before Congress
next year, but many of the other issues that failed this year will
be considered again.
</P>
<P>
   Some form of an increase in the minimum wage is expected to be
approved, possibly in conjunction with the bankruptcy bill. The
business lobbyists will be trying to make sure the increase is
accompanied by tax breaks for businesses.
</P>
<P>
   If regulation of health maintenance organizations is adopted,
the business interests want to make sure it is done in a way that
does not increase insurance premiums and that gives tax offsets to
the self-employed and to workers whose employers do not provide
health coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual alliance with Clinton, business leaders are
expected to throw their weight behind a measure that lifts barriers
against trade with China and allows Chinese membership in the World
Trade Organization. It will be a tough fight, with Republican
isolationists and Democrats aligned with labor unions against the
measure and moderates from both parties supporting it.

EUROPEAN LEADERS PLAN A RAPID INTERVENTION FORCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ European leaders are now aiming to create within three
years a rapid intervention force that could field 50,000 soldiers
and 300 to 500 aircraft for up to a year to a future conflict like
the one in Kosovo earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The principal European defense and foreign ministers agreed
loosely on this goal in Luxembourg earlier this week, and on
Thursday Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and President Jacques
Chirac of France met in London to reaffirm both countries'
determination to cooperate so that Europe could take care of its
own military problems if the United States was not available to
help.
</P>
<P>
   Whether France and Britain are in full accord on the
relationship that any future European force should have with the
NATO alliance is less clear, however.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Robertson, a former British defense secretary who is now
secretary general of the NATO alliance, said Thursday that U.S.
fears that an independent European defense would weaken
trans-Atlantic ties were groundless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who are nervous in the United States that with the
Europeans carrying more of the burden, that they would break away,
are wrong,'' he said on a visit to Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   His successor as British Defense Secretary, Geoff Hoon, also
said Thursday, ``What we want to see is a stronger European
contribution to NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I accept that different countries have different views,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what Britain will do is negotiate effectively to ensure,
first of all, that European nations can pull their weight within
NATO military operations but at the same time preserve the
essential link with NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   But France's foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine acknowledged here
recently that France was out in front of some of its allies in
arguing that a European reaction force should be able to operate
with complete autonomy even if it was put together from units that
formally belonged to the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   French officials tell U.S. listeners that European defense
autonomy would be in the best interests of the United States, which
only reluctantly got involved in stopping the war in Bosnia in 1995
and led the air war in Kosovo but not the peacekeeping force that
went in on the ground last June after Serbian forces withdrew from
the province.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Americans and we Europeans ourselves had decided that
Europeans should take charge of operations against Serbia, that
would not have been possible,'' French Defense Minister Alain
Richard said 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to his European Union colleagues in Brussels, Belgium,
about the need for stronger European defenses in a meeting on Nov.
15, Richard said not a word about the relationship that a European
military staff would have to NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance, separately, is encouraging the Europeans to build
a stronger defense ``pillar'' within it. The United States has
agreed to let a European officer take command of NATO units in
future military operations like those in Kosovo if the allies agree
that European countries alone should handle them.
</P>
<P>
   But the French, among others, worry that this procedure would
still give the Americans what amounts to a veto power over a
European force that was fully integrated within the alliance.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As a small first step toward a European defense, Germany,
France, Spain, Belgium and Luxembourg have asked the U.S. officer
who is the allied supreme commander in Europe, Gen. Wesley Clark,
to consider allowing the military staff that the five European
countries maintain in Strasbourg, France, to take over command of
peacekeeping operations in Kosovo next spring.
</P>
<P>
   To date, the Kosovo peacekeeping force has been commanded first
by a British general and then by a German general, but both
reported to Clark and NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the rest of the discussion about Europe and its role in
its own defense is academic at this point, since the European Union
has not agreed on the details of how a European defense force would
be built. But the European countries have tried to reassure their
North American allies that they don't intend to go off on their
own.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union's chief security policy coordinator is Javier
Solana, Lord Robertson's predecessor as secretary-general of the
alliance, and Solana is now also secretary-general of a 10-nation
European defense group that might become the core framework for any
future European army.
</P>
<P>
   The real question, as the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung pointed
out Thursday, is whether the European countries are really ready to
spend the billions of dollars it would take for them to catch up
with the United States and acquire the technology, communications
and intelligence systems, along with the rapid deployment aircraft
and helicopters that they found they lacked in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``A European security and defense identity, that could turn into
a European defense union some day, will not come to pass without
great political effort,'' the newspaper said.

TURKISH APPELLATE COURT BACKS KURD CHIEF'S DEATH SENTENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ A Turkish appeals court Thursday upheld the
death sentence given to the imprisoned Kurdish rebel leader
Abdullah Ocalan, but whether the sentence will be carried out
remained highly uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   In a unanimous ruling, the five-judge panel found that Ocalan's
trial on treason charges, which ended June 29, was conducted ``in
accordance with legal procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan's lawyers said they would appeal to the European Court of
Human Rights, whose jurisdiction Turkey has accepted in the past.
It could take a year or longer for the European court to make a
decision.
</P>
<P>
   In the period following Ocalan's capture in February, public
opinion in Turkey, which has been fanned by countless speeches and
articles depicting him as a ``butcher'' and ``baby-killer,'' seemed
overwhelmingly in favor of executing him. But at his trial, the
51-year-old militant acknowledged ``historical errors,'' offered to
cooperate with the state and asked his fighters to lay down their
guns. As a result, emotions have cooled considerably.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting in the mostly Kurdish provinces of eastern Turkey has
diminished in recent months, although sporadic clashes continue.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish leaders have rejected Ocalan's calls for reconciliation,
saying they cannot accept any compromise or dialogue with
terrorists. They have also rejected his suggestion that they permit
the establishment of Kurdish-language schools and television
stations.
</P>
<P>
   Many Turks detest Ocalan and blame him for the 15-year conflict
led by Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers Party in which more than 30,000
people have been killed. Several hundred of them gathered in Ankara
Thursday to cheer the court ruling. They waved placards depicting
Ocalan as a vampire and chanted, ``Hang! Hang! Hang!''
</P>
<P>
   Many Kurds in Turkey and abroad view Ocalan as a heroic figure.
Some of his supporters assembled Thursday in London and other
cities to protest the ratification of his death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision is a rejection of peace, human rights and
democratic values,'' leaders of Ocalan's rebel movement said in a
statement issued in Brussels. ``It cannot be interpreted otherwise
because it comes at a time when our forces have stopped the war and
are in a process of withdrawal.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkish leaders are weighing the effect that Ocalan's execution
would have on their ambition to join the European Union, which
forbids its member states to practice capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   At a summit in Helsinki in December, European leaders are
expected to decide whether to accept Turkey as a candidate for
membership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget the Helsinki summit if Ocalan is executed,'' warned
Hans-Joachim Vergau, the German ambassador to Turkey, in a speech
this week.
</P>
<P>
   The government is divided over how to proceed with the Ocalan
case. Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, who opposes the death
penalty in all cases, has said Turkey will await the decision of
the European court. But some leaders of Nationalist Action, the
right-wing party that is his main coalition partner, favor an early
execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should carry out what our laws provide,'' said Defense
Minister Sabahattin Cakmakoglu, who is a member of Nationalist
Action. ``We have no obligation to wait for a decision from the
European court.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Turkish law, both Parliament and the president must
approve every execution. No one has been executed here since 1984,
although there have been dozens of death sentences. By tacit
agreement among all political parties, the sentences have not been
sent to Parliament for approval.
</P>
<P>
   According to estimates by foreign diplomats, the conflict in
eastern Turkey has displaced about 3 million Kurds and led to the
destruction of more than 3,000 villages. Many of the villages were
burned by Turkish military units so they could not be used as
guerrilla bases.

AUSTRALIA TO USE X-RAYS AGAINST ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ After decades of trying to seal its
22,000-mile coastline against Asian boat people, Australia is
planning to add X-rays to its defenses against a new wave of
people-smuggling, this time from the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   X-rays are to be used to verify the ages of the Indonesian
seamen who now control the smuggling, because most claim to be
under 18 so they can escape prison sentences, when in fact, the
authorities suspect, they are adults and thus could face sentences
of up to 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Radiology can measure bone development and thus age, say
officials who plan to add X-rays to their interrogations of the
detained smugglers. Legal experts and U.N. officials said they were
unaware of X-ray age checks being used in immigration enforcement
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Combating a surge of illegal immigration attempts, naval and air
patrols off Australia's northwest coast have so far this month
intercepted a record 10 Indonesian boats trying to land 872
passengers _ mostly from Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan _ in remote
places.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration Minister Phillip Ruddock says that as many as 10,000
people from those countries are preparing to try to enter Australia
illegally by paying agents in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are facing the biggest-ever assault on our borders by
unauthorized arrivals,'' he said recently.
</P>
<P>
   Since July, about 1,700 have been arrested at sea off the
northern coasts of this island continent, most in vessels with
Indonesian crews.
</P>
<P>
   Australian officials monitoring the growing traffic in Jakarta,
Indonesia's capital, say that about 2,000 Iraqi, Afghan and Iranian
citizens are waiting there to board fishing boats and small
freighters for the 2,500-mile island-hopping voyage.
</P>
<P>
   Australia is almost the size of the United States but has a
population of only 19 million, 25 percent of them born overseas in
more than 100 countries. It is admitting 80,000 immigrants this
year from about 50 countries, on the basis of skills, family links
or refugee status.
</P>
<P>
   Ruddock says that people paying agents who promise them backdoor
entry to Australia are trying to jump the immigration line, forcing
aside legitimate applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Legal immigration processing can take two years or more for
checking personal qualifications, meeting skills quotas or
investigating refugee status.
</P>
<P>
   Government policy is to deport illegal entrants who are without
refugee claims and to detain the others, sometimes for years, while
their pleas for asylum are examined or contested in the courts, to
which such claimants have free access here.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Detention centers are crowded with immigrants awaiting either
deportation or consideration of their refugee claims, so the
government is stepping up efforts to restrict the influx.
</P>
<P>
   Although air detection and naval arrest are catching most
illegal immigrants before they land, these methods seem to deter
few smugglers or clients, who reportedly pay up to $8,000 for
``packages'' combining air fares to Jakarta, transit accommodation
and then a one-way boat ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The month, legislation was introduced in the federal Parliament
to authorize patrols to intercept suspect boats in international
waters.
</P>
<P>
   A second proposal is to deny permanent residence to those who
enter the country illegally, even those who can demonstrate
qualifications for refugee status. This change would be publicized
in Asia and the Middle East as a warning to anyone hoping to be
allowed to live here simply by landing.

<P>
   For generations, tribesmen in the Amazon rain forest have used
secretions from the skin of a frog to make poison blow darts. Now
Abbott Laboratories is developing a painkiller modeled on the
active chemical in the frog secretion that seems as effective as
morphine but without damaging side effects.
</P>
<P>
   This does not sit well with the government of Ecuador and local
environmental groups. With the American drug company standing to
make millions of dollars if the new drug is successful, they say
the country that is the source of the frog and the indigenous
people who discovered the secretions should get a share of the
proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   Angry that they have not profited from the animal and plant life
within their borders, Ecuador and many other developing countries
have begun restricting the freedom of scientists to collect
biological samples and demanding compensation in exchange for
permits. Some scientists warn that scores of research projects that
might lead to breakthroughs in medicine and agriculture, as well as
to the study and preservation of endangered species, are being
impeded or abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, things on certain species will never be done
because they'll be extinct before the countries can do it
themselves,'' said John Daly, the scientist at the National
Institutes of Health who isolated the Ecuadoran frog chemical. He
now has great difficulty getting permits. It took him three years
to get clearance from Panama to collect frogs with a cardiac
stimulant in their skin. He gave up on Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   Projects around the world have been caught up in controversy,
including a study of genes for longevity in China, a search for
cancer fighting chemicals in Southeast Asian marine life, the
breeding of new rice strains from South Asian varieties and the
development of a powerful sweetener from a West African berry.
Earlier this month, the U.S. Patent Office overturned a patent held
by an American entrepreneur on a plant from the Amazon rain forest.
</P>
<P>
   Once considered the common heritage of mankind, wild animals,
plants and crops were taken without asking or freely exchanged. Now
wildlife is increasingly viewed as a ``genetic resource,'' the raw
material of the biotechnology era, just as oil and iron were in the
industrial age.
</P>
<P>
   The Convention on Biological Diversity, forged at the Earth
Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, established that nations have
sovereignty over their genetic resources and are entitled to ``fair
and equitable sharing of the benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Philippines, Costa Rica and the Andean Pact
countries of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela have
adopted laws controlling access to genetic resources and requiring
compensation. Dozens of countries, including Brazil and India, are
considering legislation or using existing authority to regulate
sampling.
</P>
<P>
   While the Clinton administration supports the biodiversity
treaty, the U.S. Senate has never ratified it, in part because of
fears it would hurt the biotechnology industry. Nevertheless, the
United States has begun seeking compensation for collection of
micro-organisms in national parks. While many scientists support
compensating source countries, they say unreasonable demands and
red tape are threatening research.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's really happening is a tremendous slowdown in the amount
of material that's crossing borders,'' said Geoffrey Hawtin,
director general of the International Plant Genetics Resources
Institute in Rome, an institute under the auspices of the World
Bank. ``Genetic resources for agriculture as a public good, freely
available, are now becoming suddenly unavailable, locked up for
private profit.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to preserve the world's food security, the Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations is conducting an
international negotiation to ensure that seed exchanges continue
for important crops.
</P>
<P>
   Limiting exchanges could imperil agriculture, Hawtin said.
Varieties of wheat important to the Green Revolution, which
increased crop yields in previous generations, share ancestry with
as many as 30 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Natural products are also vital as pharmaceuticals, although
some drug companies are de-emphasizing natural sources in favor of
synthetic technology.
</P>
<P>
   Of the world's 25 top-selling drugs in 1997, seven, with a
combined $11.6 billion in sales, were derived from natural
products, according to ``The Commercial Use of Biodiversity,'' a
new book. These include Merck's Mevacor for lowering cholesterol,
derived from a fungus on a Japanese golf course, and Novartis'
cyclosporine, for fighting transplant rejection, derived from a
Norwegian mountain fungus.
</P>
<P>
   Plants and animals are not the only focus of tension. Some
tribesmen and others are reluctant to give samples of blood and
tissues for medical research.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really can no longer get access to some of the most
valuable resources because of the issue and the suspicions,'' said
David P. Beck, president of the Coriell Institute for Medical
Research in Camden, N.J., the world's largest repository of human
cell lines. Such cells have been used to find genes that cause
illnesses like Huntington's disease and cystic fibrosis.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the government of China halted a project, partly
financed by the National Institute of Health, that sought clues to
longevity by studying the genes of 10,000 elderly Chinese. The
project resumed after organizers promised that the samples would
stay in China and local scientists would share in patents and
publications.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Rifkin, the biotechnology critic, said efforts by
countries to restrict access to wildlife, however understandable,
were pushing the world in the same direction as the biotechnology
companies _ toward private ownership of genetic resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll have gene wars in the 21st century if we begin to
enclose the gene pool,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   HISTORY'S LESSONS: PAYING THE PRICE OF PAST MISTAKES  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The countries controlling access say that their resources have
been used without compensation, acts they call ``bio-colonialism''
or ``bio-piracy.''
</P>
<P>
   They point to two cancer drugs, vincristine and vinblastine,
developed by Eli Lilly &AMP; Co. in the 1950s and 1960s from the rosy
periwinkle of Madagascar. The drugs have helped dramatically reduce
deaths from testicular cancer and childhood leukemia and netted
Lilly hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Madagascar did not share in the profits.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, crossbreeding with barley collected from Ethiopia in
the 1950s saved California's crop from the yellow dwarf virus,
resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of increased
output, without any return to Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying it was unfair,'' said Tewolde Berhan Gebre
Egziabher, general manager of the Ethiopia Environmental Protection
Authority. ``That was before fairness in this line became an
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   One factor behind the increased chauvinism about genetic
resources is that the advent of genetic engineering is perceived as
having increased the value of genes by making them easier to
exploit.
</P>
<P>
   University of Wisconsin scientists, for instance, isolated a
protein 2,000 times sweeter than sugar from a West African berry.
The gene for that protein can now be inserted into other fruits to
make them sweeter. If a table sweetener is developed from the
protein, it will probably be produced in genetically modified
bacteria, eliminating the need for the berry itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West African plant has been replaced on the international
market,'' said Joseph M. Gopo, director of Zimbabwe's national
biotechnology laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor is the increased patenting of genetically
modified plants and animals in the West. Some developing nations
say that if a company takes a seed from a farmer's field, adds a
gene and patents the resulting seed for sale at a profit, there is
no reason the initial seed should be free.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not until we've had to deal with some of these
intellectual property issues in recent years that we've started to
have problems,'' said Henry L. Shands, of the Agriculture
Department's research service. It has long collected seeds from
abroad for the nation's seed banks and freely dispenses seeds to
other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Patents on living things changed by genetic engineering have
been allowed since a 1980 U.S. Supreme Court decision on a microbe
genetically enhanced to consume oil spills. U.S. patents are
granted for chemicals and genes isolated from plants and animals.
They have also been given for many years for plant varieties
developed by breeders.
</P>
<P>
   But many countries do not allow patents on plants and animals of
any kind and view natural products as discoveries, not inventions.
</P>
<P>
   Arguments on patenting of life are being made in the five-year
review of a global agreement known as Trade-Related Aspects of
Intellectual Property Rights. It requires signatory countries to
provide patents on micro-organisms and intellectual property
protection for plant varieties.
</P>
<P>
   Developing countries object that widespread patenting will make
them dependent on Western companies for seeds and drugs. They also
say patents ignore the contributions by indigenous peoples, who
often are the true discoverers of useful plants and animals, or of
farmers who improve crops over the generations.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiation run by the Food and Agriculture Organization is
weighing whether to compensate traditional farmers for work in
improving crops and maintaining different varieties. Malaysia has
proposed an international fund of $3 billion but the United States
opposes it.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers in India last year protested the patenting of a form of
basmati rice by Ricetec, a Texas company with annual sales of about
$10 million. Ricetec obtained a basmati seed, believed to be from
Pakistan, free of charge from an Agriculture Department seed bank.
Through crossbreeding, it developed a form of the long-grained,
fragrant rice suitable for growing in America.
</P>
<P>
   In India, the world's largest producer of basmati rice, farmers
accused the company of usurping the nation's heritage, threatening
its exports and piggybacking on the work of generations of farmers
who developed the crop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hijacking of prior innovation,'' said Vandana Shiva, an
activist on these issues in India.
</P>
<P>
   Ricetec argues that its patent covers only one variety, not all
basmati rice, and that it has no intention of trying to ban imports
from India.
</P>
<P>
   Such patents can be challenged. Two years ago, the U.S. Patent
Office overturned a patent awarded to two scientists at the
University of Mississippi for the use of turmeric, a spice, in
healing wounds. The government of India had challenged the patent
on the grounds that this was an old Indian folk remedy, not a new
invention.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the Patent Office issued a preliminary
ruling overturning a patent awarded to Loren Miller, an American
entrepreneur, on a hallucinogenic plant used in religious
ceremonies by Amazon tribes.
</P>
<P>
   One Amazon group challenged not only Miller's patent but also
his life. It declared him ``an enemy of indigenous peoples'' and
warned that if he or his associates returned to the Amazon it would
``not be responsible for the consequences to their physical
safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who lives in Newark, Calif., said he was given the plant
by a tribe in Ecuador in 1974, and built a school in return. He
cultivated the plant in Hawaii, developed a stable variety eligible
for patent, and formed a small company to see if the plant's
compounds were useful in psychotherapy or cancer treatment. Those
efforts, he said, never succeeded and are all but dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's going to invest in a company that we could all be
killed for,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   BARRING ACCESS: RESTRICTIONS SLOW EXCHANGE OF IDEAS  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the premises of the Convention on Biological Diversity
was that if countries were compensated for their genetic resources,
they would have an incentive to conserve them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't get farmers to recognize that there is a value in
a forest other than for cattle, the outlook is really very grim for
the tropics,'' said Joshua P. Rosenthal, biodiversity director at
the Fogarty International Center of the National Institutes of
Health.
</P>
<P>
   There have been some successes. In an oft-cited model, Merck &AMP;
Co. in 1991 paid $1 million to the National Institute of
Biodiversity in Costa Rica for the right to collect plants in its
search for drugs. Both the Fogarty Center and the National Cancer
Institute coordinate collections overseas involving drug companies
and academic institutions. Compensation to source countries can
include upfront payments of tens of thousands of dollars, product
royalties and training of scientists.
</P>
<P>
   But many experts say countries and companies have reached fewer
``bio-prospecting'' deals than expected, in part because of mutual
suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the world mentality was that natural resources were
common ownership, then there was a fertile utilization of natural
resources for drug discovery,'' said William Fenical, director of
the Center for Marine Biotechnology and Biomedicine at the
University of California in San Diego. ``The Rio convention
destroyed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fenical said it had taken him four years to get further access
to an Australian coral that contains what appears to be a potent
cancer-fighting chemical.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he had negotiated for two years for a permit to
sample marine organisms in the Philippines, to look for chemicals
toxic to cancer cells. While he was on the plane there last year to
begin his work, he said, the government revoked his permit and
added demands like payments of about $600,000 from Bristol-Myers
Squibb, which was to follow up leads produced by the initial
screening.
</P>
<P>
   ``They went ballistic about demands and we walked away,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Philippines in 1995 became the first country to enact a law
in response to the biodiversity convention. It requires
compensation and collaboration with local scientists and informed
consent from indigenous tribes in areas where the sampling will
take place.
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists say the rules are extremely restrictive.
According to a Columbia University study, only two of 37
applications have been approved.
</P>
<P>
   Althea Lota, a Philippine government environmental manager, said
that getting a permit is ``not really that hard'' but that the
government intends to streamline the process. Fenical's permit was
revoked, she said, because ``they did not go through the whole
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Colombia rejected an application filed by Andes Pharmaceuticals
four times. The Washington-based company was started in response to
the biodiversity convention and formed a joint venture with a local
citizen so that some profits would go back to Colombia. But
Colombia said the application was not specific enough in stating
which species would be sampled and how much cash would be paid.
</P>
<P>
   Problems may continue after samples are collected. David
Spooner, a botanist with the Agriculture Department and the
University of Wisconsin, has been unable to bring back samples of
wild potatoes he gathered in Peru earlier this year. Britain's
Portsmouth University was pressed to return 120 bottles of marine
fungi obtained in Thailand several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy has dogged the first bio-prospecting agreement in
the United States. In 1997, for a $100,000 payment and royalties
ranging from a half of 1 percent to 10 percent, the Diversa Corp.
of San Diego won the right to collect microbes from Yellowstone
National Park's geysers for five years.
</P>
<P>
   The Park Service entered the profit-sharing agreement because it
had already lost out once. In the 1960s, a microbe discovered in a
Yellowstone hot spring yielded a heat-resistant enzyme that is now
key to a DNA-amplification process. Hoffmann-LaRoche, which owns
the patents, gets about $100 million a year from them. Yellowstone
gets nothing.
</P>
<P>
   But some opponents of biotechnology, arguing that these genetic
resources should not be commercialized, sued and won a temporary
suspension of the Diversa agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ROUGH TRANSITION: NO GOING BACK TO THE OLD WAYS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say a major obstacle to bio-prospecting is that many
countries overestimate the value of raw genetic resources. Drug
companies may need to invest $500 million to develop a drug over 15
years. How much should a country get merely because a plant happens
to live within its borders?
</P>
<P>
   The chances of finding a big drug are remote. The National
Cancer Institute has collected 50,000 plant samples from 30
countries since 1986 and has only one drug in clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies like Abbott and SmithKline Beecham, have cut back
natural drug discovery programs. A new technology called
combinatorial chemistry allows them to generate thousands of
synthetic compounds quickly. Some companies still doing natural
drug research focus on micro-organisms and fungi, which can be
found all over the world, not just in the tropics, and can be
reproduced in vats.
</P>
<P>
   Valuing raw genetic resources can be difficult when the link
between drug and source is indirect, as with Abbott's painkiller.
The company said it owes no compensation to Ecuador because it
merely got the inspiration for its drug by reading a scientific
paper about the frog chemical.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never seen the frog,'' Michael Williams, a vice
president, said. ``We've never touched the frog.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Ecuadoran officials acknowledge that they have no
legal right to compensation because no rules were in effect when
the frogs were collected by Daly in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say the problem is not that payments are too high
but too low to encourage conservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bio-prospecting stuff is turning out to be just a
flimflam,'' said Ed Hammond of Rural Advancement Foundation
International, a Canadian group. ``It's not doing anything for
developing countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Nations and tribes can be played off against one another,
weakening their bargaining positions, when plants grow in more than
one area. One NIH project, unable to get into the Philippines, went
to Laos and Vietnam instead.
</P>
<P>
   Some developing countries are becoming more directly involved in
the commercialization of their genetic resources. Brazil is
reluctant to let plant samples be taken to the United States, so
the National Cancer Institute does its drug screening on Brazilian
plants there. The Malaysian state of Sarawak has formed a joint
venture with an American company to conduct clinical trials of an
AIDS drug discovered there.
</P>
<P>
   Some say rough spots are to be expected as the world moves from
free to controlled access of genetic resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the realization is coming that this isn't some sort of
`green gold,' and it's going to take a lot of work and a lot of
cooperation to derive the benefits for all parties,'' Gordon M.
Cragg of the National Cancer Institute said. But, he added,
``There's not going to be a return to the old days when everyone
would just walk in and take things out.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Like the great navigators who first sailed around the world,
establishing its size and the curvature of its surface, astronomers
have made new observations that show with startling directness the
large-scale geometry of the universe and the total amount of matter
and energy that it contains.
</P>
<P>
   The results of those observations have provided powerful support
for an audacious theory, first proposed 20 years ago, that might
help answer the ultimate existential question: what ignited the Big
Bang explosion in which scientists believe the universe was born?
</P>
<P>
   The delicate measurements relied on telescopes placed high on
mountains or borne by balloons to observe slight irregularities, or
ripples, in a faint glow that permeates space and is thought to
have been emitted from the fading fireball of the Big Bang
explosion itself. That glow is called the cosmic microwave
background radiation, and the ripples imprinted on it can be used
like ticks on a ruler to measure the cosmos.
</P>
<P>
   The new data also provide fresh evidence to support a finding
two years ago that expansion of the universe is accelerating under
the influence of a strange form of energy that fills empty space
and apparently acts against gravity. Many researchers had assumed
that the bizarre finding would eventually be disproved, but the new
observations support the existence of this energy, as well as the
theory of what set off the Big Bang, called inflation, which was
first proposed in 1980 by Dr. Alan Guth, a physicist at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has such tremendous implications for the universe,'' Dr.
Rocky Kolb, a cosmologist at the University of Chicago, said of the
new work. Kolb described the range of its implications as
staggering.
</P>
<P>
   One set of results, released Thursday, were obtained by a team
led by scientists at the California Institute of Technology and La
Sapienza, the main campus of the University of Rome, using a
balloon-borne telescope for observing microwaves. A report
describing the results of this so-called Boomerang experiment was
posted on a Web site maintained at the Los Alamos National
Laboratory; it has not yet been subjected to peer review.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, scientists at Princeton and the University of
Pennsylvania, who placed a telescope on a mountain in Chile,
published similar results in Astrophysical Journal Letters. Dr.
Mark Devlin, from the University of Pennsylvania and a member of
the team that worked in Chile, said, ``These are completely
different experiments with completely different calibrations and
they fall right on top of each other.''
</P>
<P>
   A third team, centered at the University of California at
Berkeley, has also released its preliminary map of the microwave
background, made with another balloon-borne telescope.
</P>
<P>
   The teams' conclusions rest on measurements of the precise size
of the ripples in the microwave background radiation. That size
turns out to be about 1 degree on the sky, or about twice the
apparent size of the full moon as seen from Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the ripples is a direct indicator of the large-scale
geometry of the universe, which, according to Einstein's general
theory of relativity, is in turn determined by the total amount of
matter and energy that the universe contains. Ripples of one degree
indicate a ``flat'' universe, in which parallel lines never cross.
Inflation, the theory of what provided the fuel for the Big Bang,
predicts a universe that is almost exactly flat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing that the universe is flat to amazing precision,''
said Dr. Craig Hogan, a cosmologist at the University of
Washington. ``It's what inflation predicted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically it gets a flat universe dead-on,'' said Dr. Scott
Dodelson, a cosmologist at the University of Chicago. And that
leads astronomers to their next conclusion: because the amount of
matter found by astronomers cannot produce a flat universe,
Dodelson said, ``the inescapable conclusion is that there is some
unknown form of energy contributing to the total density.''
</P>
<P>
   The most likely candidate for that exotic energy, Hogan and
Dodelson said, is what has come to be known as the cosmological
constant, an energy with repulsive gravity that might fill
apparently empty space. Einstein first proposed the concept,
thinking that he needed it to keep the universe from collapsing,
but he later renounced the idea when it was discovered that the
universe was expanding.
</P>
<P>
   The geometry of the universe is determined solely by the amount
of matter and energy contained in it, according to Einstein's
general theory of relativity, which explains gravity as the
``curvature'' of space-time. In a geometrically ``closed''
universe, photons of light, initially traveling parallel to each
other, would eventually converge, just as lines of longitude on
Earth's curved surface meet at the poles.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmologists agree that the universe could have three possible
geometries. Besides the closed geometry, the universe might be open
or flat. In an open geometry, parallel lines would diverge, and in
a flat universe they would simply remain parallel.
</P>
<P>
   Relativity predicts that a closed universe contains more matter
and energy than a certain fixed amount. An open universe contains
less, and a flat universe holds precisely that amount: the one
predicted by Guth's theory.
</P>
<P>
   According to the theory of inflation, a small piece space became
catastrophically stretched by the energy of fields that are
predicted by advanced theories of physics. Those theories unify all
known interactions between particles. No matter how curved that
part of space might have been to begin with, this ``inflation''
would have stretched it out, like the surface of a balloon as it is
blown up, in a tiny fraction of a second and created a flat
universe. The tremendous well of energy in the inflated piece of
space would have served as the fuel for the subsequent fireball of
the Big Bang.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In the present universe, gravity does warp the relatively small
regions of space close to massive objects like the sun, neutron
stars or black holes. Still, some cosmologists had suggested, on
purely aesthetic grounds, that the universe in the large would be
free of curvature. Inflation, with its cosmic stretching, was the
first theory to explain why those suspicions might be true.
</P>
<P>
   But despite that stretching, inflation would also leave telltale
ripples on this exploding, Big Bang universe. The ripples occur
because of principles of quantum mechanics, which impose a kind of
small-scale fuzziness on all particles. The ripples in the
microwave background are thought to be the legacy of that early
quantum fuzziness.
</P>
<P>
   The background radiation, cosmologists believe, was emitted from
the fireball of the Big Bang after the inflationary expansion a few
hundred thousand years after the creation event. The radiation then
traveled through space for some 15 billion years, the present age
of the universe, and arrives at Earth as a sort of cosmic fossil.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ripples themselves were produced during inflation,'' said
Kolb.
</P>
<P>
   Because cosmologists can calculate the actual size of the
ripples in the young universe, their apparent size on the sky is a
measure of whether they traveled to Earth on straight or curved
paths. The paths turned out to be straight, providing the main
piece of evidence for the flat universe.
</P>
<P>
   The Boomerang experiment measured the ripples using a telescope
based on reflecting, aluminum optics and a cooled, semiconducting
detector that looks like a tiny spider web, said Dr. Paolo de
Bernardis, an astrophysicist at La Sapienza, who is a principal
investigator of the Boomerang experiment. The microwaves heat the
detector very slightly, and that change is converted into an
electronic signal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system is so cool and so clean that you can detect these
changes in the system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Maxima experiment, based at Berkeley, used a related
balloon-borne system. The Microwave Anistropy Telescope, which made
its own measurements from a mountain in Chile, used an entirely
different detector based on powerful electronic amplifiers.
</P>
<P>
   All of the data are consistent with a flat universe, said
scientists on the projects and others who have read the teams'
reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``These really favor a flat universe,'' said Dr. Alessandro
Melchiorri, an astrophysicist at La Sapienza.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Two scientists at Bell Laboratories in New Jersey, Dr. Arno A.
Penzias and Dr. Robert W. Wilson, discovered the cosmic microwave
background by accident in 1965, and received a Nobel Prize for
their discovery in 1978. Equipment of that era was not sensitive
enough to see ripples in the radiation, so Penzias and Wilson
detected it as a smooth glow or hiss.
</P>
<P>
   Kolb of the University of Chicago said that the new results
easily represented the biggest step in the field since NASA's
Cosmic Microwave Background Explorer first saw the barest outlines
of the ripples in 1992. Even that satellite could not detect the
much tinier ripples that have been measured by the new telescopes.
Kolb described the reaction of inflationary cosmologists to the new
data as one of ``guarded euphoria.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists on all the experiments said that even more precise
data were soon to be published, offering the promise of even
tighter tests of inflation, and of the geometry and contents of the
universe. De Barnardis said that his team had made even more
accurate microwave observations that would be made available within
the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``You haven't seen anything yet,'' said Dr. Adrian T. Lee, a
Maxima collaborator at Berkeley. ``We are entering the era of
precision cosmology.''

AFTER TAKING ILL, YELTSIN POSTPONES BELARUS PACT 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Boris Yeltsin on Thursday put off plans to
sign a unification treaty with Belarus, a political and diplomatic
extravaganza which had been scheduled for Friday, after falling ill
with what aides said was viral bronchitis.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders immediately speculated that the illness was a pretext
to delay the treaty, which is widely seen as a political coup for
Belarus' autocratic president, Alexander Lukashenko, and a mixed
blessing for Yeltsin and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But Yeltsin's spokesman said later that the treaty would be
signed in about two weeks, after the president had time to recover.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's recurring bouts of bronchitis have sometimes sidelined
him for a month or more, and have twice worsened into pneumonia.
But some aides indicated that the latest infection was not serious
so far.
</P>
<P>
   The president ``just lost his voice and has a cold,'' said Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin on Thursday, shortly after Yeltsin
completed a cabinet meeting at which his remarks were said to have
been barely audible.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, 68, was taken to his usual country home, Gorky-9, north
of Moscow to rest after stopping at a hospital for a checkup. His
office canceled a meeting next week with the president of Lithuania
and said that Yeltsin would not see foreign visitors until he meets
with Ukraine's newly re-elected president, Leonid Kuchma, on Dec.
6.
</P>
<P>
   For Lukashenko, who had planned to fly to Moscow on Friday,
Yeltsin's illness once more postpones an event for which he has
already waited three years.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called unification treaty would stop somewhat short of
what its nickname suggests. It proposes that the two nations remain
independent states, but form a political confederation which would
lead by 2005 to common tax and customs laws and a single currency.
A new council of leaders would oversee the confederation.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of union is politically popular in both nations. Many
analysts say that is precisely why the treaty signing was set for
Friday, just before crucial parliamentary elections in Russia, on
Dec. 19. Lukashenko, who is struggling with hyperinflation and
increasing attacks on his regime by human-rights critics, could
also use some political help.
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, it is unclear whether the treaty would do
much more than give its signers a political bounce. It would
require both ratification and a constitutional change to take
effect in Russia, and the union faces powerful opposition from some
political sectors.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Substantively, analysts say, the document is not much different
from a previous declaration that Yeltsin and Lukashenko signed with
flourish in 1996, flanked by the patriarch of the Russian Orthodox
Church.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Putin said that negotiations between the two
nations had not been completed and that ``there are different
viewpoints on the form of treaty to be signed and the forms of
integration.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no doubts over the idea of union itself,'' he was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   After a seemingly endless string of colds and bouts of
exhaustion in 1998, Yeltsin has seemed somewhat heartier during
recent, if rare, public appearances. Those who saw him a week ago
in Istanbul, where he gave a speech before the Organization on
Security and Cooperation in Europe, said he seemed unusually fit.
</P>
<P>
   But Yeltsin has fallen ill during or after various trips abroad,
and he apparently weakened on returning to the coldest weather of
Moscow's young winter, with temperatures brushing zero.

NEW BONDS MAY HELP REDUCE JAPANESE INSTITUTIONS' BAD DEBT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Tokyo office of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter priced
the first set of bonds linked to nonperforming Japanese real estate
loans Thursday, paving the way for what may be a flood of deals
aimed at clearing away the mountain of bad debt on the balance
sheets of Japanese banks and financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time a capital markets solution has been
used to bring new investors and liquidity into the real estate
market here,'' said Douglas Kennedy, executive director of the
securitized products group at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was worth 21 billion yen, or about $200 million, making
it larger than many in the market thought it would be. Kennedy said
all but 4 billion yen of the bonds had AAA or AA credit ratings.
</P>
<P>
   He said he thought about 60 percent of the securities would be
sold to Japanese investors, with the remainder distributed about
equally between Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investment bankers have long advocated the development
of a market in securities tied to Japan's vast pool of
nonperforming real estate debt. The precise figures are still
unknown, but rough estimates suggest that Japanese financial
institutions hold 80 trillion to 100 trillion yen, or $766 billion
to $957 billion, in bad debt. As much as 50 percent of it is
related to real estate, which lends itself to securitization, in
which loans are packaged together and sold as bonds to investors.
</P>
<P>
   That has had investment bankers salivating. Kennedy said that
even if only 10 percent of those real estate loans were suitable
for securitization, underwriters would have the opportunity for 250
deals, and lucrative ones at that.
</P>
<P>
   But until a year or so ago, banks and other financial
institutions had been slow to jettison their bad debts, afraid of
damaging long-held relationships. Banks have tended to write off
their bad loans by gathering reserves against them, which leaves
the assets on their books.
</P>
<P>
   That is changing, Kennedy said, noting that the mortgages that
Morgan Stanley cobbled together to sell Thursday had all been
bought by Morgan Stanley between August 1998 and March 1999.
``Financial institutions are really serious about cleaning up their
balance sheets now, but it's only happened in the last two years,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   That, coupled with a renewed appetite for Japanese assets in
general among global investors, and changes in laws governing real
estate transactions, led to the opportunity that Morgan Stanley
took Thursday.

 Firms Turn to Teens as Pool of Older Workers Shrinks  &HT;     By Sam McManis

Shoppers barely glanced his way, but Nathan Smith continued to toss
a ball attached to a long elastic cord at a kiosk in San Rafael's
Northgate Mall. Time and again, the ball hit the tiles with a loud
``thwap,'' then sprang back to his palm. Bungee Balls weren't

   Amy Robinson's shift at the Paradise Bakery and Cafe at the
Sunvalley Mall in Concord had only just begun, but she was already
swamped at the cash register. It can be hectic at the food court,
no job for a slacker, but Amy keeps pestering her boss for more
hours.
</P>
<P>
   She is 15 and saving for a car.
</P>
<P>
   When the school day at Oak Grove High in San Jose is over, Sean
Sharma hacks around on a computer. This is work, not goofing off.
Sean has developed the Web site for Cypress Human Resources in San
Jose, and it's his job to maintain the site, fix glitches and
upgrade, upgrade, upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   He may be just 16, but he's got stock options and a salary that
his boss says would equal $50,000 if he were to choose to work full
time.
</P>
<P>
   From fast food to retail to high tech, more teens are working
more hours after school and on weekends, especially during the
holiday season, in which retailers are scrounging for help. And
they're starting at a younger age, too. The U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics recently reported that 57 percent of the nation's
14-year-olds have some work experience. For 15-year-olds, the
figure rises to 64 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Though there are no previous government studies to compare, some
experts say that teens today are starting jobs at a younger age
because the pool of older workers is depleted by the 30-year low in
unemployment figures.
</P>
<P>
   Under California law, the minimum working age is 12, but most
businesses in the state abide by the federal occupational
restrictions that minors must be 14, work no more than three hours
per school day, eight hours a day on nonschool days and not more
than 18 hours per week. California law says 12-year-olds may never
work on school days. The exception is in the entertainment
industry, where children as young as 15 days cq  &LR; may work on movie
or TV sets under rigid restrictions. ``There's a huge gap in the
workforce, and it's got to be filled somewhere,'' said Rich Halberg
of Joint Venture: Silicon Valley Network, a nonprofit business
group. ``It's a sign of the times. Demand is high, but it's a
trade-off for the kids. Sure, they get jobs and some might get
stock options, but are they losing out on having fun and being
kids?''
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Greenberger, University of California at Irvine psychology
professor and author of ``When Teenagers Work,'' believes most
teens in burger-flipping jobs would be better off spending more
time studying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teenagers who work long hours in today's routinized adolescent
workplace of mostly dead-end jobs are more cynical about the value
of hard work and more tolerant of improprieties on the job than
peers who don't work,'' Greenberger writes. ``Ours is the only
major industrialized nation that encourages student employment
among college-bound teenagers.''
</P>
<P>
   But several teens interviewed at jobs ranging from whipping up
lattes to solving government employees' computer problems say
working raises their self-esteem and bank accounts, doesn't affect
their grades and, in the case of high-tech teens, may lead to
lucrative jobs upon graduation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think 14 is a little late to start working,'' said Nathan, a
freshman at Terra Linda High in San Rafael. ``When I was 11, I was
stocking shelves for a friend at the 7-Eleven. If somebody's able
to work, what difference should age have?''
</P>
<P>
   Amy, a sophomore at College Park High in Pleasant Hill who has
worked at her food service job for two months, said maturity, not
age, should determine a teen's fitness for employment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a job definitely takes up a lot of your time,'' she
said. ``But if you can handle it, I definitely recommend it. It's
great to have your own money.''
</P>
<P>
   It falls upon Amy's mother, Debbie Robinson, to shuttle her
daughter to and from work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait until she's 16 and can drive herself, but it's
not too bad,'' Robinson said. ``Our concern was about her
schoolwork. So far, it's OK. At least having her work tells me
she's not lazy. She's a very motivated girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Many teens see after-school jobs, especially in high-tech
fields, as good early career moves. The Department of Labor reports
that 29,000 teens worked as computer programmers and systems
analysts in 1998, up from 5,000 programmers in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   According to Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas, an international
outplacement firm that tracks workplace trends, the top teen
computer whizzes earn more than $100,000 out of high school. As
Rick Cobb of Challenger says, ``the appeal of working in a
fast-food environment doesn't have the same panache as sitting at a
real desk in front of a computer.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the case for Stephen Deem, a 17-year-old senior at
College Park High who started working as a computer technician for
Contra Costa County at 15. His salary had increased from $9 an hour
to $15.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really had to prove to the people I knew what I was doing,
because most of the workers are in their 30s, 40s or 50s,'' Stephen
said. ``I'd go over to Social Services to fix teir computers, and
they'd look twice at me. I knew they were worried I was going to
blow up their computers. There's that type of discrimination. But
once you prove yourself, it's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Anu Shahrabani, 15, a sophomore at Miramonte High in Orinda,
works as a free-lance Web site designer from her home after school.
She said adults listen to her and treat her like any other contract
worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would make them (the employer) look bad if they didn't
listen to me and take my advice, because they are the ones who
hired me,'' she said. ``Computer designers are in high demand and I
think (employers) accept that teens know computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Most high schools have computer classes and teach basic skills.
Some schools, mostly in Silicon Valley, offer advanced classes that
teach HTML. But Anu, whose father works in the computer consulting
industry, said she learned from reading books and
``experimenting.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  In Silicon Valley, teen computer expertise is readily
accepted, if not automatically assumed. Sean got his job as
Webmaster at Cypress Human Resources after he built the company's
site last year as part of an Oak Grove High technology club called
EagleWeb. Club members are matched with small businesses in the
area to develop Internet presences.
</P>
<P>
   After word got out that Sean had helped build a Web site for the
American Electronics Association, ``a bunch of executives pulled
him aside and said, `Hey, would you like to work for us?'''
according to Dennis Barbata, Oak Grove's technology coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Rick White, CEO of Cypress Human Resources, said his firm
employs five teenagers in jobs ranging from tech support to data
entry to scouring resumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say one out of three make it,`` White said. ``It's a lot
of responsibility for a kid. But this one (Sean) is a gem.... &UR;  &LR; I
don't want the press asking me about him, because everybody on the
planet will come after him. IBM will be calling him tomorrow and
I'll lose him. (Sean) is kind of quiet, but if he's conceited it's
because he knows he's good. He's not afraid to tell you what he
thinks, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Sean works mostly from home via his personal computer _
presumably after doing homework _ and only huddles with Cypress
staff a few hours a week. Once Christmas break comes, Sean will be
seen around the office more, White said. But he still does not
exceed the 18-hour per week limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's absolutely no issues about him getting along with
other employees,'' White said. ``He's totally accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   Other high-tech teens do face acceptance issues, however.
Barbata said his ``E-Whiz Kids'' at Oak Grove can handle computers
but ``they've got to work on their people skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Some teens, such as 15-year-old Andrew Yaneu of Orinda, avoid
dealing with wary employers by starting their own businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Andrew and his older brother, Alex, started a
``filmmaking and high-tech audio'' company out of their home.
Andrew has filmed everything from Eagle Scout ceremonies to dance
performances to football highlight reels. One recent weekend, he
spent three hours filming a bar mitzvah. Then, he spent 10 hours
editing the footage. He made $325. Andrew says he makes sure he
does not work more than the alloted hours for his age.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I enjoy it,'' he said. ``It's something I'd do for free.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Teens who work in retail or food service seem to develop
people skills quicker, said Marci Vanerstrom, general manager of
the Paradise Bakery and Cafe at Concord's Sunvalley Mall. Marci
says she gets most of her teen workers from nearby College Park
High and that she was looking for more 15-year-olds because she
doubles her staff during the holidays. She faces other problems,
such as unreliability.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 15-year-olds I've had, for the most part, have been
excellent,'' she said. ``Whenever people apply, I always look at
the experience and it's blank. I say, `I hope you understand, you
have to sweep, you have to mop, you have to do the dishes.' I
always let them know, because standing behind the counter and
collecting money, that looks fun. Picking up after people isn't so
fun, and you have get a high turnover because of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gini Carini, a 16-year-old sophomore at Carondelet High in
Concord, has worked at the Paradise bakery for more than a year.
Early on, she said, she almost quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was real busy, really crazy and I'm like, `What am I
doing?' '' Gini said. ``It was my first job. It was hard. But after
more practice, it got easier. I'm working 15 hours a week now and
it moves fast. And I've kept my same GPA (3.3). I'm still not old
enough to use the slicer or climb a ladder. But the older I get,
the more fun stuff I get to do.''

JACKSON MIGHT SHAKE UP STARTERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Coach Phil Jackson has hinted at possible changes
to the starting lineup this week, but the most obvious change
suddenly seems less likely.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has considered moving power forward A.C. Green to the
bench, where he might be more effective as a mid-game rebounding
sparkplug. That move could come as soon as tonight, when the Los
Angeles Lakers play the New Jersey Nets at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   But Green just played one of his better games of the season,
successfully negating Utah's Karl Malone while pulling down 10
rebounds in an all-around solid performance Wednesday. Green's
potential replacements, meanwhile, are struggling.
</P>
<P>
   One option is to go small and play 6-foot-7 Rick Fox. The more
likely option is 6-10 Robert Horry, who continues to look tentative
on the court.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Jackson still likes the idea of using the
36-year-old Green as a reserve, a scenario he has envisioned since
training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like what happened on the court in the couple
(exhibition) games that Horry started,'' Jackson said, ``then we
went back to A.C. and then Horry was having trouble with his knee.
So it was a combination of things, and we got off to a pretty good
start, and we felt comfortable staying the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Foul indeed: The Lakers rank as the worst foul-shooting team in
the NBA, which is not surprising considering Shaquille O'Neal has
averaged below 40 percent for most of the season, and he leads the
league in trips to the free-throw line. But he's had plenty of help
in dragging down the team average.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Fisher, normally a reliable foul shooter, has hit just 29
of 47 (61.7 percent). Ron Harper has shot 17 for 25 (68 percent).
Brian Shaw is 14 for 22 (63.6). The Lakers' best free-throw
shooters are Glen Rice and Kobe Bryant, and the latter hasn't
played. Rice is at 86.9 percent from the line (73 for 84).

<P>
   NESTOR FALLS, Ontario _ Just beyond Wolf Island, Donna Hanson
was closing her fishing camp for the season, locking up tourist
cabins before the ice reached across Lake of the Woods. With the
coming of the ice, 14,652 islands turn into one vast winter
wilderness, empty but for wandering deer, moose and bears.
</P>
<P>
   But as the late autumn light fell on faded photos of happy
American anglers holding up fat trophy fish, her mood soured as she
talked of her bucolic world being drawn into an international trade
vortex _ spun by NAFTA, the World Trade Organization and the muscle
politics of neighboring Minnesota's governor, Jesse Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to have a trade person in Washington, D.C.,
tell us how to run our lake,'' fumed Ms. Hanson, whose family built
the first peeled-spruce log cabins here on King Island in 1926.
</P>
<P>
   In a pique over pickerel, the United States has used
conflict-resolution mechanisms set up by the North American Free
Trade Agreement to force Ontario to drop a two-year-old regulation
that said that non-Canadian anglers could keep walleye and sauger
fish caught on the Canadian side of this border-straddling lake
only if they were staying in an Ontario lodge. The Canadians said
the fight was over conserving walleye, a buttery-tasting sport fish
often known here as a pickerel; the Americans said the fight was
over fishing dollars.
</P>
<P>
   In early November, U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky
took time out from preparing for trade trips to Beijing and Seattle
to release a victory statement about this obscure fish fight. The
headline: ``U.S. prevails in dispute with Canada over sport fishing
and tourism services.''
</P>
<P>
   To some Canadians, it was a familiar story of the U.S. bullying
Canada on trade issues, whether it is walleye or television
programming or magazine advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``We appear to be losing more than we should,'' said Peter
Bleyer, executive director of the Council of Canadians, a
nationalist group. ``Every time our government hears any
threatening noises from south of the border, they back down.'' His
Ottawa-based group is sending a ``protest train'' across Canada to
swell the ranks of protesters at the World Trade Organization
meeting that opens on Nov. 30 in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   To the Americans, it is a case of NAFTA rules giving speedy
relief to the little guy. ``When it is your livelihood, it is very
big potatoes,'' said Celeste Colson, owner of Jake's Northwest
Angle, one of 14 fishing lodges in Angle Inlet, Minn., an American
enclave on the western shore of the lake. Canadian tourist maps
have traditionally used fish photos to blot out this American
presence on the lake. Escalating the walleye war, Ontario's 1998
lodging rule promptly cut the Angle's business in half. ``We were
pretty sure it was basically illegal,'' Ms. Colson said, ``but they
were getting away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Giving an international trade tour d'horizon from her lakeside
lodge 300 miles north of Minneapolis, Ms. Colson predicted mayhem
in Seattle, saying, ``There is an ugly kind of satisfaction at
smacking around the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   When American lodge owners in the Angle started talking about
seceding from the United States and joining Canada, their plight
drew the attention of Jim Southwick, a lawyer in Minneapolis who
learned how to handle trade levers in the mid-1990s when he worked
in Washington as the trade representative's lawyer for NAFTA
issues. There are fewer than a dozen U.S. -Canadian trade issues in
the NAFTA resolution pipeline, a tiny amount for the $1 billion a
day in goods that cross the border every day in the world's largest
trading relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process really worked _ in nine months we went from a
start to a resolution of the matter,'' said Southwick, calling the
fish fight a textbook case for speedy resolution of trade disputes
through the five-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement. ``It
is not very often that small-business owners are in position to
take advantage of the trade machinery.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barshefsky's office started the NAFTA process last April
with a formal investigation. Ontario's overnight lodging rule had
already damaged Minnesota's $70 million tourism industry on the two
international lakes affected, Lake of the Woods and nearby Rainy
Lake. Then, last fall, Ontario threatened to extend the rule to all
international waters along Minnesota's northern border, potentially
harming a $700 million tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, the former wrestler turned governor, reacted with rage,
warning, ``Canada shouldn't mess with Minnesota.'' To put authority
behind the threat, Minnesota's legislature started debating a bill
to tax freight trains rolling through a 43-mile Minnesota section
of the Canadian National railway that links Manitoba and Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   The threat was not taken lightly on the Canadian side of this
lake, where the most prominent landmark in Kenora, the largest
town, is a 40-foot high statue of ``Husky the Musky,'' a two ton,
steel and fiberglass rendering of a muskellunge fighting fish. With
more than 10,000 tourist beds to fill on the Canadian side of the
lake, Kenora has polished its tourist image ever since 1905, the
year it dropped its Indian-derived name, Rat Portage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their new governor down there is trying to prove he can do the
job, that he can get a victory,'' said Mal Tygesson, owner of
Evergreen Lodge and past president of the Kenora District Camp
Owners Association. ``The thing we find very scary is that a trade
deal on tourism gives them unfettered access to a resource.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Although Evergreen Lodge is on Eagle Lake, a completely Canadian
lake, Tygesson said that the new ruling allowed busloads of
Minnesotans to come up to his lake, fish the local limit _ two
walleyes _ and then go back down to Minnesota without spending a
Canadian cent in Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   ``They take their fish, put them on the bus and then take them
home at night,'' said Tygesson, whose lodge is 50 miles north of
the border. ``If one country has the right to do that with the
resources of another country, then they have the right to do that
with the water, with the trees. The U.S. is a mammoth, a giant.
It's hungry, and it's looking for resources all around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In Lake of the Woods, an island-dotted liquid expanse that
stretches over an area larger than Rhode Island, Canadian resort
owners contend that Americans control only a third of the lake but
stuff their creels with more than half of the annual catch. They
say that Canada largely froze the development of new lodges in the
1970s. In contrast, they say, Minnesota continues to build lodges
that can only make money if they have access to game fish, which
are more prevalent in the deeper waters of the Canadian side.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are saying, `We don't want you to have our fish,''' said
Tom Pearson, owner of Camp Narrows Lodge on Rainy Lake. ``We have
lost control of our waters.''
</P>
<P>
   When Pierre Trudeau was Canada's prime minister, he once
lectured provincial premiers who wanted control of international
fishing policy: ``Fish swim.'' But today many Canadian lodge owners
cite studies by Canadian biologists to show that some of the lake's
walleye populations are Maple Leaf nationalists from gills to
tails, rarely venturing into U.S. waters, where there are few
sheltering islands.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesotans respond that Canada's conservation plan meant
forcing anglers to spend dollars in Canada to catch the same fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, too, are concerned with conservation,'' said Ron Payer,
chief of fisheries for the Minnesota Department of Natural
Resources. Immediately after Ontario abandoned its lodging rule,
Minnesota cut its summer limit of walleye and sauger to eight from
14. In turn, Ontario has raised its total summer limit to four from
one.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the hiatus between summer fishing and ice fishing,
tourism operators hope the two countries can converge on their
limits.
</P>
<P>
   Erick Bennett, owner of the Maple Leaf Motel in Sioux Narrows,
recently savored a relaxed, off-season Sunday lunch. Perhaps
inadvertently, he spun a NAFTA-esque scenario for walleye limits:
``I would like one day to see equal rules _ one lake, one rule.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   For generations, tribesmen in the Amazon rain forest have used
secretions from the skin of a frog to make poison blow darts. Now
Abbott Laboratories is developing a painkiller modeled on the
active chemical in the frog secretion that seems as effective as
morphine but without damaging side effects.
</P>
<P>
   This does not sit well with the government of Ecuador and local
environmental groups. With the American drug company standing to
make millions of dollars if the new drug is successful, they say
the country that is the source of the frog and the indigenous
people who discovered the secretions should get a share of the
proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador and many other developing countries have begun
restricting the freedom of scientists to collect biological samples
and demanding compensation in exchange for permits. Some scientists
warn that scores of research projects that might lead to
breakthroughs in medicine and agriculture, as well as to the study
and preservation of endangered species, are being impeded or
abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, things on certain species will never be done
because they'll be extinct before the countries can do it
themselves,'' said John Daly, the scientist at the National
Institutes of Health who isolated the Ecuadoran frog chemical. It
took him three years to get clearance from Panama to collect frogs
with a cardiac stimulant in their skin. He gave up on Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   Projects around the world have been caught up in controversy,
including a study of genes for longevity in China, a search for
cancer fighting chemicals in Southeast Asian marine life, the
breeding of new rice strains from South Asian varieties and the
development of a powerful sweetener from a West African berry.
Earlier this month, the U.S. Patent Office overturned a patent held
by an American entrepreneur on a plant from the Amazon rain forest.
</P>
<P>
   The Convention on Biological Diversity, forged at the Earth
Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, established that nations have
sovereignty over their genetic resources and are entitled to ``fair
and equitable sharing of the benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Philippines, Costa Rica and the Andean Pact
countries of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela have
adopted laws controlling access to genetic resources and requiring
compensation. Dozens of countries, including Brazil and India, are
considering legislation or using existing authority to regulate
sampling.
</P>
<P>
   While the Clinton administration supports the biodiversity
treaty, the U.S. Senate has never ratified it, in part because of
fears it would hurt the biotechnology industry. Nevertheless, the
United States has begun seeking compensation for collection of
micro-organisms in national parks. While many scientists support
compensating source countries, they say unreasonable demands and
red tape are threatening research.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's really happening is a tremendous slowdown in the amount
of material that's crossing borders,'' said Geoffrey Hawtin,
director general of the International Plant Genetics Resources
Institute in Rome, an institute under the auspices of the World
Bank. ``Genetic resources for agriculture as a public good, freely
available, are now becoming suddenly unavailable, locked up for
private profit.''
</P>
<P>
   The countries controlling access say that their resources have
been used without compensation, acts they call ``bio-colonialism''
or ``bio-piracy.''
</P>
<P>
   They point to two cancer drugs, vincristine and vinblastine,
developed by Eli Lilly &AMP; Co. in the 1950s and 1960s from the rosy
periwinkle of Madagascar. The drugs have helped dramatically reduce
deaths from testicular cancer and childhood leukemia and netted
Lilly hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Madagascar did not share in the profits.
</P>
<P>
   Patents on living things changed by genetic engineering have
been allowed since a 1980 U.S. Supreme Court decision on a microbe
genetically enhanced to consume oil spills. But many countries do
not allow patents on plants and animals of any kind and view
natural products as discoveries, not inventions.
</P>
<P>
   Developing countries object that widespread patenting will make
them dependent on Western companies for seeds and drugs. They also
say patents ignore the contributions by indigenous peoples, who
often are the true discoverers of useful plants and animals, or of
farmers who improve crops over the generations.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the U.S. Patent Office overturned a patent
awarded to two scientists at the University of Mississippi for the
use of turmeric, a spice, in healing wounds. The government of
India had challenged the patent on the grounds that this was an old
Indian folk remedy, not a new invention.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the Patent Office issued a preliminary
ruling overturning a patent awarded to Loren Miller, an American
entrepreneur, on a hallucinogenic plant used in religious
ceremonies by Amazon tribes.
</P>
<P>
   One Amazon group challenged not only Miller's patent but also
his life. It declared him ``an enemy of indigenous peoples'' and
warned that if he or his associates returned to the Amazon it would
``not be responsible for the consequences to their physical
safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who lives in Newark, Calif., said he was given the plant
by a tribe in Ecuador in 1974, and built a school in return. He
cultivated the plant in Hawaii, developed a stable variety eligible
for patent, and formed a small company to see if the plant's
compounds were useful in psychotherapy or cancer treatment. Those
efforts, he said, never succeeded and are all but dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's going to invest in a company that we could all be
killed for,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There have been some successes. In an oft-cited model, Merck &AMP;
Co. in 1991 paid $1 million to the National Institute of
Biodiversity in Costa Rica for the right to collect plants in its
search for drugs. Both the Fogarty Center and the National Cancer
Institute coordinate collections overseas involving drug companies
and academic institutions.
</P>
<P>
   But many experts say countries and companies have reached fewer
``bio-prospecting'' deals than expected, in part because of mutual
suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   Valuing raw genetic resources can be difficult when the link
between drug and source is indirect, as with Abbott's painkiller.
The company said it owes no compensation to Ecuador because it
merely got the inspiration for its drug by reading a scientific
paper about the frog chemical.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never seen the frog,'' Michael Williams, a vice
president, said. ``We've never touched the frog.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Ecuadoran officials acknowledge that they have no
legal right to compensation because no rules were in effect when
the frogs were collected by Daly in the 1970s.

`GHOSTS': YIELDING TO SOCIAL SHAM _ THE SIN IN IBSEN'S CREED 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By D.J.R. BRUCKNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Ghosts'' has this going for it: Anyone who has
absorbed it never again has to wonder what Ibsen means. This is the
heart of the religion, delivered in a two-hour sermon of Stygian
darkness. And the production at the Century Center for the
Performing Arts, part of a series presenting all of Ibsen, aims at
purity. J.C. Compton, founder of the center, directs, and she has
enlisted as dramaturge the president of the Ibsen Society of
America, Joan Templeton.
</P>
<P>
   The play has problems. In places the text is so over the top,
especially in the third act, that it tempts actors to chew the
scenery. And a logical lapse undermines the central argument: If
Mrs. Alving, the protagonist who becomes the main victim, had
abandoned her husband after discovering his profligacy instead of
staying on and upholding society's rules, her son would still have
inherited his fatal syphilis from his father; so she would have
done what Ibsen judged the right thing, only to have tragedy fall
on her, even as it does after she does the wrong thing. The
problems can be masked in performance, but that is a delicate
business.
</P>
<P>
   Restraint is not the hallmark of this production. Kathleen
Garrett brings strengths to Mrs. Alving: The woman's guilt is
pitiable and repelling at once, and Ms. Garrett knows how to make
Mrs. Alving's silences part of other characters' conversations. But
after a fine display of the Alving pride in Act I and her confident
arguing of Ibsen's ideas in the next act, her collapse into what
can only be called hysteria at the end seems, at the least, out of
character.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the conniving Engstrand (Stephen Payne) is made such
a rustic clown that you doubt he can be as smart as he is, or that
Mrs. Alving could ever have trusted him to conceal for life the
fact that her maid's baby was her husband's daughter. As for the
son (Dennis Turney), he is the slightly bewildering oddball he
ought to be until his cries for help and for death at the end
become so melodramatic that they alienate the audience. The one
actor who manages a perfect tone throughout is Mark Elliot Wilson;
his Pastor Manders is such an inventively indestructible hypocrite
that he never fails to infuriate us.
</P>
<P>
   Ibsen was asking what gets people into such messes and answering
that it was weakness in the face of social sham. It is possible to
apply very different _ if you will, softer _ shades to these
characters without muting the message. After all, through 10
generations even the Spanish Inquisition clothed its purposes in
the civil language of the age; it is precisely the courtliness of
its declarations that chill a reader's blood even now: What they
meant shines through. And speaking of delicacy: I am happy to have
a somber cello groan at me between acts, but when wispy little
voices float out of the speakers whenever Mrs. Alving speaks her
various lines about the earth being filled with ghosts of dead
beliefs and values, I feel like groaning.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The characters in ``The Absolution of Willie Mae''
talk about money a lot. Willie Mae's man, Bubba, has married a rich
white woman who has $11 million. Willie Mae's sister Minerva is
married to a guy who makes $150,000 or so, which is why she stays
with him. Bubba uses an immorally gained $265,000 to start a
taxicab business (his wife's millions, apparently, aren't good
enough for him). Somebody is mysteriously putting an extra $100 a
month in Willie Mae's bank account. Now if only somebody would take
a little of that and buy her a new sofa. Gmerice Carter's set makes
good use of space, but the title character's house is a dump.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, it's a relief to see money dealt with straightforwardly
after decades of television characters saying things like ``Well,
how about this amount?'' and coyly writing unseen figures on
notepads. Jane Austen always acknowledged the importance of
finances in people's lives, too. But in this well-meaning but
chaotic drama, the characters' references to and uses of money _
like so much else in the script _ doesn't always add up.
</P>
<P>
   That's a shame, because ``The Absolution of Willie Mae'' was
written by Joseph Walker, who made his reputation in 1972 with the
Negro Ensemble Company's production of ``The River Niger,'' which
moved to Broadway and went on to win the Tony Award as best play.
That work had a heavy father-son element, and so does the new one.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Mae (Gabrielle Lee) makes her entrance with a black eye,
courtesy of Bubba (O.L. Duke), the longtime man in her life. It's
morning, she's pouring herself a stiff drink and she can tell it's
not going to be a good day. Her son Larry (Sean Allen Rector) is
moving out because he can't stand to watch Bubba (his father) treat
his mother that way. Corey (Gregory Marlow), Willie Mae's other
son, who appears to be severely mentally retarded, is getting on
her nerves. Being the great mom that she is, she mimics him and
calls him a ``blubbering idiot.'' Her daughter, Tina (Meka
Lawrence), is walking around the house in shorts, complaining about
her singing lessons. Minerva (Joyce Sylvester), Willie Mae's
sister, drops by to establish her character as a lovably comic
slut.

   Into this lively household comes a would-be boarder. His name is
Jeff Williams (Michael Wright), which was the name of the son, the
young Air Force dropout, in Walker's ``River Niger.'' Jeff is so
soft-spoken and languid that he seems to have come out of another
decade, the 1950s at the latest (or maybe it's just his hat that
gives him that aura). He turns out to be a sensitive English
professor (and author, we presume, since there's a mention of a
bonus from his publisher at one point) whose marriage recently
ended. Willie Mae is attracted; Bubba, who stays overnight a lot
despite having a wife at home, doesn't want him around.
</P>
<P>
   If that were the only plot, the audience might be able to keep
things straight. But the play also brings in sexual abuse of
children, gunpoint and knifepoint encounters, the illicit selling
of term papers, literacy, prostitution and a miracle medical cure.
The play is alternately pretentious and melodramatic. At least a
couple of times, characters suddenly stand still onstage and recite
less than brilliant poetry. At other times they talk like newspaper
articles (``Bubba went to Tessa's Long Island estate''). And the
only absolution is the possibility that one character may be
rescued by the love of a good man as against a bad one. Early in
the play, Willie Mae defines herself as a can't-help-it kind of
person and tells Larry: ``Can't-help-its can't help themselves.
They need an anchor.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily the production has strengths as well. Wright, who played
the lead singer of a rhythm-and-blues group headed for dissipation
in Robert Townsend's film ``The Five Heartbeats,'' has a compelling
stage presence and several fine moments. He has real comic style
telling a story about two elderly white people, and he reacts
perfectly when Willie Mae reveals, after Jeff mentions irony to
her, that she thinks the word means being made of iron.
</P>
<P>
   Duke effectively makes Bubba detestable; the audience almost
hisses his entrances. Ms. Sylvester brings energy and conviction to
her role as Minerva. And Rector does well in a double role, as
Larry and as Corey's not-too-bright chatterbox pal Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Absolution of Willie Mae,'' frantically directed by Susan
Watson Turner, continues at the Kaufman Theater through Dec. 19.

<P>
   There was a time when the accounting police worried about
companies that tried to avoid reporting losses. Now the cops are
trying to keep companies from taking excessive write-downs.
</P>
<P>
   That such vigilance is necessary is a commentary on the fads and
fashions of Wall Street. Starting in the 1980s, companies
discovered that they could look good if they reported certain kinds
of losses that reflected efforts to become lean and mean. Analysts
were persuaded to ignore such charges and concentrate on operating
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the size and frequency of such write-offs grew.
``Call this behavior Son of Gresham,'' wrote Warren Buffett in
Berkshire Hathaway's latest annual report. ``Bad accounting drives
out good.'' He added that ``the distortion du jour is the
`restructuring charge,' an accounting entry that can, of course, be
legitimate but that all too often is a device for manipulating
earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   The accounting rule makers tried in 1994 and 1995 to put limits
on such write-offs, but their efforts met with success that can be
generously described as limited. Last year, Securities and Exchange
Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt complained that companies were
taking ``big baths'' to get costs out of the way and make their
subsequent profits look better than they were. Now the SEC has
produced a staff accounting bulletin that may reduce the abuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a growing trend here which is disturbing,'' said Lynn
Turner, the SEC's chief accountant, in an interview just after the
bulletin was released on Thanksgiving Eve. He recalled how
Americans used to mock the way European companies could create
reserves to hide earnings swings and said that such things were now
happening in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Turner thinks the rules on such write-offs should be tightened
and said he hoped the Financial Accounting Standards Board would do
just that. But for now, the bulletin simply lays out the existing
rules with details and examples that may make restructuring
reserves smaller and less common. It should strengthen auditors'
backbones when their clients try to take the biggest possible
baths.
</P>
<P>
   When taking a restructuring write-off, companies must
specifically identify and disclose the costs involved and the
anticipated effects on future profits. They must say which plants
will be closed and which departments and locations will make
layoffs. They need to be certain that the restructuring will
happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you set up one of these reserves, you have to be pretty
sure that those are the costs you'll incur,'' Turner said. ``When
you get out there two or three years down the road, I don't see how
you can do that.'' If cost estimates prove to be too high,
companies may not use the reserve to hide other expenses.
</P>
<P>
   I've talked to enough companies over the years to know that many
companies have taken a more cavalier approach than the SEC thinks
correct, either in disclosing details of restructuring charges or
in taking write-offs for things that may never happen. A couple of
weeks ago, General Motors reported that it may have to reverse a
good part of a $1.1. billion reserve because the strong economy
means that it won't be cutting jobs as previously planned.
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to see how many companies, confronted
with the new bulletin, decide that they need to make adjustments to
previous restructuring charges. What advice, I asked Turner, would
he give to a chief financial officer in such a position?
</P>
<P>
   ``Take Maalox,'' he said, ``before you eat turkey.''

CROATIA MOVES TO DECLARE AILING PRESIDENT INCAPACITATED 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAGREB, Croatia _ The Croatian government, meeting Thursday in
emergency session, asked the Constitutional Court to declare the
ailing President Franjo Tudjman temporarily incapable of carrying
out his duties.
</P>
<P>
   The court is expected to agree within 24 hours, the period
stipulated in a constitutional amendment passed Wednesday. Tudjman,
who has run Croatia like an autocrat since it became independent of
Yugoslavia in 1991, has been incommunicado in a hospital since Nov.
1. He is 77 and is reported to be close to death from stomach
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Once the court agrees, the speaker of Parliament, a member of
Tudjman's governing Croatian Democratic Union, will take over key
presidential powers. The speaker, Vlatko Pavletic, is expected to
authorize parliamentary elections on Dec. 28 or 29, a timing seen
as favoring the governing party, which fears losing power to a
center-left opposition coalition now ahead in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   There must be at least 30 days for campaigning after the
announcement of an election. Before falling so ill, Tudjman had
favored an election date of Dec. 22, but did not formally declare
it. Parliament's term expires on Saturday, and new elections must
be held by Jan. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Ivo Pukanic, the editor of the independent weekly Nacional, said
in an interview Thursday that an election in the holiday period
favored the conservative, more rural-based Tudjman party, because
Croatian workers abroad will be home to vote, urban workers will be
in their native villages and richer, more liberal Croats ``will be
abroad skiing, in Austria, Italy or Slovenia.''
</P>
<P>
   Abstentions are also likely to be higher during the holiday,
also favoring the more tightly organized governing party. Still,
Pukanic believes that with the party unpopular because of
corruption and a weak economy, the opposition will win a majority
in Parliament. But he said the party was likely to win a separate
election for president to succeed Tudjman, if it can agree on the
centrist foreign minister, Mate Granic, a favorite of Washington,
as its candidate.
</P>
<P>
   In a daily medical bulletin Thursday, doctors said Tudjman's
condition remained grave but ``is stabilizing thanks to intensive
treatment.'' There were no other details.
</P>
<P>
   But the leadership of his party asked the government to meet to
declare the temporary incapacity of Tudjman.
</P>
<P>
   ``After receiving the opinion of the medical team, the
government has decided to ask the Constitutional Court to determine
temporary incapacitation of President Tudjman,'' Prime Minister
Zlatko Matesa told reporters after the cabinet met.
</P>
<P>
   The death of Tudjman, who had a sometimes confrontational
relationship with Washington and the European Union over questions
of war crimes, autocracy, media control and political repression,
is expected to ease Croatia's entry into the West. An opposition
victory in elections deemed free and fair would have a significant
impact, not just on Croatia's relations with the West, but also on
the rest of the Balkans, including Serbia, where a democratic
opposition is trying to oust Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Pavletic, whose own mandate was extended by Parliament on
Wednesday, can hold temporary presidential powers for 60 days, but
they are renewable.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the holiday race for the consumer's dollar
already under way, the satellite television industry is still
poised anxiously at the gate. The starting gun for a marketing push
that could put its pizza-size dishes under hundreds of thousands of
Christmas trees this year sits on President Clinton's desk.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Clinton is expected to sign the omnibus spending plan
approved by Congress last week. Attached to that bill is the
Satellite Television Home Viewers Act, which will for the first
time enable companies like DirecTV and EchoStar Communications
Corp. to compete with cable television providers on equal footing
by allowing them to carry local TV stations.
</P>
<P>
   The rules eliminate a key stumbling block to competition between
local cable monopolies and satellite providers that offer expansive
channels on a generation of satellite dishes that sell for $100 to
$200. Until now, satellite subscribers also needed a traditional
television antenna or cable service to receive their local news,
sports and weather. Under licensing laws enacted in 1988 to
increase the programming available in rural and other small
markets, satellite companies could not carry local stations but
they could carry network affiliates from other parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   As those provisions approached a January expiration date, the
satellite industry and congressional leaders wanted to expand the
law to enable the satellite companies to carry local programming.
While local affiliates also wanted to be carried by satellite
services, however, they demanded concessions that would prevent the
satellite companies from also beaming in broadcasts from other
affiliates of the same network.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the local stations won provisions that will
prohibit satellite services from carrying another network affiliate
to households within approximately a 75-mile radius of a local
affiliate _ twice the radius to which cable companies must adhere.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of the bill's signing, DirecTV says it will begin
sending local network affiliate stations to its subscribers in New
York City and Los Angeles. And the company says it will be ready to
offer local stations to the top 25 television markets, or about
half of the country's 100 million television households, by
January.
</P>
<P>
   EchoStar says it hopes to have local programming available in 13
markets next week, and in 30 to 35 cities by the end of the first
quarter of next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the stroke of the president's pen, we will begin lighting
up local channels,'' said Bob Marsocci, the communications director
for DirecTV, the leading satellite service, based in El Segundo,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Marsocci said the inability to give households local programs
``has been our No. 1 impediment for potential customers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When they find out local channels are not available, they
don't buy,'' he said. ``This should remove the final barrier to
entry.''
</P>
<P>
   A congressional aide for Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., who heads
the House Commerce Committee, called the legislation the ``the last
piece of the puzzle'' for deregulating the cable industry.
</P>
<P>
   Still, within the satellite television industry, there is
disagreement about just how successful the bill will be in opening
the marketplace to fair competition.
</P>
<P>
   DirecTV, a division of Hughes Electronics Corp., a wholly owned
subsidiary of General Motors, calls the legislation a tremendous
win for consumers, ``finally leveling the playing field between
satellite and cable.''
</P>
<P>
   EchoStar, on the other hand, had aggressively opposed some of
the final provisions, saying Congress caved in to lobbyists.
Perhaps surprisingly, much of the lobbying came from local
broadcasters, not cable companies. In fact, the cable companies
supported the bill for their own political reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Although cable companies have traditionally held monopolies in
their local markets, Congress, as part of its overhaul of
telecommunications laws, deregulated cable rates in 1966 because a
new generation of inexpensive satellite television delivery was
coming on the scene and was considered sufficient competition.
</P>
<P>
   That competition, however, was stifled by the satellite
companies' inability to carry local channels.
</P>
<P>
   The cable companies supported this year's satellite act on the
premise that a piece of pro-competitive legislation was far more
desirable than a return to tighter regulation of their rates,
especially at a time when the cable industry is poised for a new
era of competition in markets for local phone service and
high-speed Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   So the showdown in Congress was between satellite operators and
the local affiliates of networks like ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox, which
allow only one affiliate per market so that stations affiliated
with the same network would not compete with each other.
Represented by the powerful lobbying of the National Association of
Broadcasters, the local stations were able to thwart several key
provisions of the original bill sought by satellite companies.
</P>
<P>
   EchoStar wanted provisions to guarantee that satellite companies
would not have to pay more than their cable competitors in any
market for the rights to retransmit local broadcasts. Echostar also
opposed a provision requiring satellite companies to carry all
channels in a local market because the provision would require the
company to negotiate separate contracts with each station.
</P>
<P>
   The real fight came over the rules for carrying distant
channels, or network programming from other markets. The bill
codifies a court ruling earlier this year that requires satellite
companies to cut off subscriber access to distant network
programming if viewers are in an area capable of picking up a local
network signal with a traditional antenna.
</P>
<P>
   But a station's theoretical broadcast area is often meaningless
to viewers who cannot get the signal because of interference. That
has left some viewers in a gray area, unable to pick up a clear
local signal and unable to receive distant network broadcasts. With
the new bill, the viewers will be able to receive the local
stations, although there is a bigger blackout area for distant
signals on satellite than cable. Cable companies cannot provide
distant signals to customers within a 35-mile radius of a local
station on the same network. That window is more like 70 miles for
satellite customers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Echostar's chairman and chief executive, Charlie Ergen, said
earlier this month that the final bill ``limits consumer channel
choices and takes more money out of the consumer's pockets.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is no question that the legislation unlocks true
competition between the satellite and cable industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a perfect bill, `` said Marsocci of DirecTV. ``We
are not happy with every provision, but on balance we do support
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The rates for satellite television are very competitive with
those of most cable services, ranging from under $10 a month for a
basic package to upwards of $100 for access to extensive packages
that include hundreds of channels of digital quality entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The price of satellite dishes required for reception have
dropped as low as $100, and are often accompanied by special deals
on service to help offset the initial purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   Marsocci said his company's new marketing campaign was already
in place, targeting the top 25 television markets just in time for
the holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been gearing up for this and preparing for quite some
time,'' he said. ``We'll be placing primarily print advertisements,
full-page print ads in the daily newspapers in each of the
markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Judi Anne Atencio, director of communications for EchoStar, said
similar plans were in the works at that company's Littleton, Colo.,
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's like yellow tape around the marketing department right
now,'' she said. ``That is a dangerous place to be. The president
is expected to sign the bill around noon on Monday, and about five
minutes later we'll be selling.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Egan, a cable and satellite analyst with Paine Webber in
New York, said consumers would quickly see the effects of the
legislation in the rollout of new services over the next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is going to happen is every few months month there is
going to be a new development,'' he said. ``I think what will
happen is they will try to compete less on price and try to compete
more on services.''
</P>
<P>
   Egan said he expected cable companies to focus their energy on
high-speed Internet and new digital services, while satellite
companies will be focusing on increased programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the beginning. It is going to get very exciting
in the year 2000.''

U.S. BRUSHED ASIDE MEXICAN ROLE, EX-DRUG CHIEF SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By TIM GOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ During the five years that Thomas Constantine
spent as the United States' top drug-enforcement official, he never
sat down with President Clinton to discuss drug policy. He was
never called to brief the president on a major enforcement issue.
The phone never rang for a chat.
</P>
<P>
   Constantine, who went to the job after more than three decades
in the New York State Police, initially took some pride in being a
Washington outsider. But by his retirement last summer, he
acknowledges, he had become a different kind of outsider _ one
circumvented by the White House, particularly in its annual
evaluation of anti-drug efforts in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``The policy-makers from the National Security Council and the
State Department started with the premise that they were going to
certify Mexico,'' Constantine said recently of what he described as
the administration's unspoken determination to put economic
concerns ahead of drug issues. ``Their question was `How do we get
around the facts presented by Tom Constantine?'''
</P>
<P>
   Depending on one's perspective, Constantine emerged at the head
of the Drug Enforcement Administration as either a truth-teller
among cynical bureaucrats or a resonance box for the sometimes
conspiratorial views of his agents.
</P>
<P>
   Constantine uses the word ``whistle-blower'' with a beat cop's
derision; when the subject of his bureaucratic battles arises, he
says he has no interest in attacking the president or his policies,
even those with which he disagreed. Still, it is hard to leave a
few long conversations with Constantine, 61, without the impression
of a man struggling to hold his tongue out of loyalty to a system
he sees as flawed and a president he does not seem to respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched that situation for five and a half years, and every
year it became worse,'' he finally said of the drug trade in
Mexico. ``We were not adequately protecting the citizens of the
United States from these organized-crime figures.''
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman, Mike Hammer, said the administration
would have no comment on Constantine's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the nation's drug policies are coming under their
sharpest public attack in decades, Constantine came through his
tenure as the drug-enforcement agency's administrator relatively
unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   Challenges to the Clinton administration's limited efforts to
reduce the demand for illegal drugs have been directed mainly at
the White House and its drug-policy adviser, Gen. Barry McCaffrey.
Criticism of its policies on drug laws and other enforcement issues
has mostly fallen on McCaffrey and Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   But while budgets rose steadily at the Drug Enforcement
Administration under Constantine, allowing for the hiring of
hundreds of new agents, there has been relatively little evidence
that the agency is making any real headway against the world's most
powerful traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   The Drug Enforcement Administration played a central role in the
arrests of Colombian cocaine bosses in 1995 and 1996, only to see
smaller, more elusive groups quickly take their place. After having
some success in Bolivia and Peru, the agency has watched much of
the drug business there shift to Colombia. And while the agency has
struck at some important traffickers in Asia, it has been mostly
helpless as drug production has reportedly risen sharply in Burma
and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it clear that Constantine's efforts to strengthen the
drug agency's ties to local and state police forces contributed
significantly to the declines in drug violence. The General
Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, said in July
that it was hard to assess the agency's work at all because of its
failure to set measurable standards of performance.
</P>
<P>
   A notoriously demanding boss, Constantine was said by some of
his critics within the agency to have driven away some of its most
experienced officials, a charge he denies.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Constantine said his greatest frustration came from
Mexico. Evidence of the growing power of Mexican drug mafias
greeted him almost as soon as he took over the agency in March
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican traffickers were by then taking as much as half of the
Colombian cocaine they moved into the United States as payment for
their services. Mexicans were also dominating the growing U.S.
market for methamphetamine and expanding their distribution of
heroin across the western United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``In retrospect, we underestimated their importance,''
Constantine said of the Mexican traffickers. ``The focus at the
time was all on Colombia.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Constantine said he quickly detected another pattern as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we had a major case involving a criminal
organization from Mexico operating in the United States, there was
a significant allegation of corruption involving the Mexican
attorney general's office, a Mexican state police force, the
highway police,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, Constantine said, other Clinton administration officials
were resolute: U.S. concerns about Mexico's corruption and
drug-trafficking problems were secondary to trade and other
economic interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was, if you said those things publicly, if you
release documents, you will just aggravate the situation,'' he
said. ``My concern was that we had kids in this country dropping
like flies. Maybe that was parochial, but I felt like I was the
only person there who felt like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after Constantine's counterpart in Mexico was found in 1997
to have been colluding with the country's biggest cocaine
trafficker, serious discussion of the issue within the Clinton
administration was minimal, even negligible, he said. The exception
was the annual debate over whether to certify the anti-drug efforts
of Mexico and other nations that produce or ship illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone would say, `Your facts are correct, but there are
bigger policy issues involved,''' Constantine recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Constantine, who now teaches at the State University of New York
at Albany and consults on law enforcement, said it had never
occurred to him to resign in protest. ``My sense was that you
always ought to try to make it work,'' he said.

FEDERAL JUDGE BEGINS DEALING WITH A MOUNTAIN OF EVIDENCE IN WACO
CASE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Austin, Texas _ Nearly six years after David Koresh's strange
ministry of God and guns ended in flames at the Branch Davidians'
compound near Waco, more questions than answers continue to rise
out of the ashes.
</P>
<P>
   And the legal battle that has kept the case alive has gained
steam in the last week, with a federal judge stepping in to settle
rancorous disputes over evidence and issuing rulings that are
providing new insights into the case.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Justice
Department's special counsel sparred over who should get first
access to potential witnesses in two new Waco inquiries. At the
same time the federal government, responding to a demand by U.S.
District Judge Walter S. Smith, completed delivery to the
courthouse here of a mountain of evidence related to the 51-day
standoff and fire in which Koresh and about 80 others died in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is supervising a wrongful death civil lawsuit filed
against the government by the survivors of Branch Davidians who
were killed in a federal weapons raid at the sect's Mount Carmel
compound in February 1993 and in the subsequent fire on April 19,
1993, which started during an FBI assault with tanks and tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit is to be heard in May, and Smith has been moving to
gather all of the evidence under his control, in part because of
assertions by the U.S. attorney formerly handling the case that the
government might be withholding data from the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   William Johnston, the U.S. attorney for the Western District of
Texas who made the contentions, was removed from the case in
September.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Smith ordered that shell casings taken from a
farmhouse near the scene be turned over to a special counsel
appointed by the Justice Department. The counsel's office will
conduct ballistics tests that could help determine whether federal
sharpshooters fired into the compound, as asserted by the
plaintiffs' lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're never going to know the entire truth about Mount
Carmel,'' said Michael Caddell, a lawyer for the plaintiffs. ``But
can we answer the question of whether or not the government fired
on the Davidians? I think we can, and I think we will in the course
of this lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department had twice resisted both the wide-ranging
nature and the timetable for producing all government-held
documents in the case. But an order by Smith set a deadline of Nov.
15 and signaled his displeasure with the slow pace of the
government's compliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court is not unmindful that the government waits not only
until the last day, but until the last minute, to respond to every
order this court has issued,'' the judge's order said. ``That
practice causes the court to be suspect of the government's desire
to comply with its orders.''
</P>
<P>
   In August, Smith took possession of materials gathered by the
Texas Rangers from the wreckage of the fire revealing that the FBI
had apparently misled government officials about the possible use
of pyrotechnic tear-gas canisters on the final day of the siege.
</P>
<P>
   That information, and reports that the Defense Department's
Delta Force had been more heavily involved in the standoff than was
previously known, led Attorney General Janet Reno to appoint John
C. Danforth, a former senator from Missouri, as an independent
special counsel to re-examine the government's role in Waco. The
Senate Judiciary Committee has also launched its own inquiry, under
a subcommittee led by Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Six people, including four federal officers, were killed in the
initial raid by agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms that sparked the standoff. Fifty-one days later, David
Koresh and about 80 of his followers died as fire swept through the
compound when the FBI, which had assumed control of the operation,
used tanks to pump in tear gas in an effort to end the standoff.
</P>
<P>
   In gathering material on the siege from government agencies,
Smith has demanded original documents, which could be important in
analyzing infrared images that the plaintiffs' lawyers think are
essential to their case.
</P>
<P>
   More than twenty of the bodies found in the wreckage of Mount
Carmel showed evidence of gunshot wounds. The FBI has maintained
that no government officials fired their weapons during the
standoff and subsequent fire. They say that panic, fear of death by
fire, or fear of capture led the Branch Davidians to kill each
other.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers representing the survivors say that infrared videotape
shot from a plane in the last hours of the standoff shows flashes
of automatic weapon fire directed toward the compound from
government positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see these telltale flashes any other time, you don't
see them any at other location, there's no other explanation for
them other than gunfire,'' Caddell said. ``Even the government's
own experts have no explanation for it.'' He said the videotape
would answer conclusively whether there was government gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said that electronics experts hired by the plaintiffs'
lawyers had found that portions of the tapes they had received from
the government had been erased or altered, making access to the
originals key to the case.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials have said the flashes were probably
reflections of mud puddles or pieces of metal.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Caddell challenged the government by asking Smith to
supervise a re-enactment of the April 19 events at a Dallas firing
range to determine whether the tapes actually indicated gunfire.
The Justice Department refused to cooperate in such a test, but on
Nov. 5, Danforth's office, saying the issue was significant to the
special investigator's mission, joined the plaintiff's lawyers in
seeking a re-creation.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Smith sided with the plaintiffs and the special
counsel's office, ordering all parties in the lawsuit to
participate in the re-enactment. But on Monday the government
appealed the order, saying a re-creation would add ``more confusion
than clarity.''
</P>
<P>
   Court filings indicate that the materials now in the Waco
court's possession include thousands of audio- and videotapes,
computers and computer disks, nearly 171,000 pages of documents
from the FBI, 588 White House documents and 37,000 pages from the
Department of Defense, 7,000 of which remain classified.
</P>
<P>
   The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms _ which conducted
the original raid to arrest Koresh on automatic weapons violations
_ turned over 134 boxes of materials, nine of which were sealed for
review by the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Court filings show that at least some original documents will
not be made available to Smith: a private contractor hired to
duplicate at least 750 pages from the FBI sent them by mistake to a
landfill near Washington. The contractor kept three copies of the
documents, however, and at least one was forwarded to the court.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ At 6:30 Thursday morning, a Macy's official told her
associates the news: The bad-weather front that was supposed to
pass through had stalled. There would be sprinkles, downpours and
only brief moments of no precipitation. The air for the 73rd Macy's
Thanksgiving Day Parade would feel frigid, despite temperatures in
the mid-40s.
</P>
<P>
   The effects of that stalled front were immediate, sharp and
persistent. A thousand cheerleaders shivered in transparent
ponchos. Clowns dressed like slices of pizza jumped up and down to
keep warm. A balloon handler cursed as he opened his gloves and
discovered he had been given two left ones. The knees of drum
majorettes were painfully crimson.
</P>
<P>
   But promptly at 9 a.m., as if with one voice, the massed
thousands shouted, ``Let's have a parade!'' As has happened since
1924, except for wartime years, the parade participants strutted
down Central Park West on a journey to Herald Square and the
beginning of the Christmas season. Along their soggy route, they
passed umbrellas of every size and color bobbing and swaying like
some kind of surreal mushroom patch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year it was a lot worse than this,'' said Bruce Rossi, a
jester clown from Union County, N.J. ``It didn't dampen our spirits
then and it won't now.''
</P>
<P>
   The parade's theme, perhaps inescapably, was the millennium.
Each of 14 bands played a song relating to the passage of time. The
O'Fallon Township High School band of O'Fallon, Ill., played ``Does
Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?'' The Jackson High School band
of Massillon, Ohio, played ``Rock Around the Clock.''
</P>
<P>
   The lead balloon was Snoopy, revamped as Macy's ``Millennium
Mascot,'' a true party animal in silly hat blowing a gaudy horn.
Floats included one meant to suggest the ``mystical essence of
time,'' through a sundial, a model of Stonehenge and other
features.
</P>
<P>
   The millennial spirit appeared to be reflected by crowds that
seemed more enthusiastic and larger than last year, when the rain
and cold were both more severe. At Times Square, which will be the
center of the city's New Year's celebration, the congestion was
particularly great.
</P>
<P>
   A group of French tourists left Times Square halfway through the
parade because of the difficulty in seeing bands and floats.
``There were too many people,'' said Benoit Gress of Nice.
</P>
<P>
   The police gave no crowd estimate. Macy's guessed it was at
least the usual 2 million, despite the weather. The only crime
along the parade route was apparently one picked pocket, a police
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There seemed little discussion of the incident two years ago
when the Cat in the Hat balloon _ driven by fierce winds _ escaped
from its handlers and slammed into a lamppost, knocking off the
post's horizontal arm. The falling arm struck Kathleen Caronna,
then 33, of Manhattan in the head and knocked her to the ground.
She spent nearly a month in a coma and is now suing Macy's, the
city and the manufacturer of the lamppost for $395 million.
</P>
<P>
   That resulted in a number of changes in the way the parade is
staged, including repositioning lampposts and removing the largest
balloons from the parade. Some parade goers said they missed the
huge balloons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bigger balloons added diversity,'' said Tom Olson, 41, a
public relations executive who lives in Rye. ``I miss them,
especially the Cat in the Hat _ but it's understandable.''
</P>
<P>
   One band in the parade on Thursday that marched with an added
purpose was from the Trinity Valley Community College in Athens,
Texas. When the college's band appeared in the parade eight years
ago, one of its members was Nicole Barrett, who is recuperating at
Bellevue Hospital Center after being struck with a paving stone in
a random attack on a midtown street last week. The band marched
again this year, in an appearance scheduled last spring, and wore
purple ribbons in honor of Ms. Barrett.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do we like about New York?'' said band member Mark
Eubank, seeming to savor a reporter's question. ``The pizza's
good,'' he finally answered.
</P>
<P>
   One of his bandmates dismissed the notion that New Yorkers were
dangerous. ``I'm probably crazier than most people in this town
anyway,'' he said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   But the big topic on Thursday was rain, rain and more rain. Not
a few people left early, among them Sue Howell, who had taken her
13-year-old granddaughter to see her first Macy's parade. They
spent about a half-hour perched on an iron railing on Central Park
West before finally bailing out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't see anything,'' Ms. Howell said. ``There are so many
people and umbrellas. My son has a nice apartment and we're going
to watch it on television.''
</P>
<P>
   A very few seemed to delight in the inclement weather. Among
them was Olson, of Rye. He built a scaffolding from an aluminum
ladder and covered it with waterproof fabric. He and his family had
an excellent view of the parade, while staying fairly dry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a scout leader,'' Olson said. ``I like to be prepared.''

CIVILIAN POLICE FORCE BRINGS NEW PROBLEMS IN HAITI
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ Renan Etienne keeps his military academy
diploma hanging in his office, although it is an odd decorative
touch. He is the Port-au-Prince commander for the Haitian National
Police, the civilian force that replaced the brutal and corrupt
Haitian army.
</P>
<P>
   After Etienne spent eight years as a military officer, his
career there ended in 1994 when the reformist President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide disbanded the military.
</P>
<P>
   The Haitian military worked hand in hand with the country's
dictators, brutalizing and terrorizing civilians in the decades
that preceded Aristide's election in 1990. Then the military
deposed him and forced him into exile. After he returned with
American backing, he replaced the military with a civilian police
force.
</P>
<P>
   Etienne was among a handful of former officers with both the
experience and clean records to qualify them as commanders for the
mostly rookie police force.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same job,'' he said tersely on a recent day.
</P>
<P>
   But his two careers are hardly comparable. Unlike the army, the
civilian force, which was trained by police officers from a
U.N.-led mission, is seen as being relatively respectful of human
rights. But also unlike the army, which had ample weapons and
resources to back up its power, the fledgling force finds itself at
times scrambling to meet its basic needs. That has led, he said, to
a morale crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not have enough human and material resources,'' Etienne
said. ``It seems if you have radios, they have no batteries. If you
have cars, they have no tires. If you have guns, they have no
bullets.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly four years since it was founded, and just months away
from the end of the full-time American military presence in the
capital, the Haitian National Police is struggling to maintain
order while people complain increasingly about crime and a lack of
security.
</P>
<P>
   Of the original 5,300 members, 1,000 have been dismissed for
corruption or human rights abuses, and the force is trying to
recruit replacements. Without enough seasoned commanders, normally
culled from the ranks of street-savvy officers, some towns have no
police supervisors. Specialized units critical to investigative
work are just now being formed.
</P>
<P>
   These internal challenges are made all the more difficult by
external pressures. Haiti's judicial system badly needs reform:
caseloads are backlogged for years, judges are poorly trained, and
many are believed to be corrupt. Criminals with enough influence
are freed soon after their arrests. Human rights monitors suspect
that several police officers, frustrated by the failings of the
courts, have taken part in vigilante killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be hard enough under normal conditions,'' said Pierre
Denize, the chief of the Haitian National Police. ``The conditions
here have been less than normal. If I, as the head of this
institution, said we do not need anything more, I would be very
wrong. Institutional development is a notion that entails 15-year
spans of time. Here, we're talking about four years.''
</P>
<P>
   The most troubling challenges yet emerged in February, when
popular organizations aligned with Aristide's Fanmi Lavalas
political party, citing the crime problem, clamored for the
resignation of Robert Manuel, the vice minister for state security,
whose jurisdiction includes the police force. Manuel is part of the
administration of Rene Preval, Aristide's hand-picked successor.
But with Aristide apparently planning to run again, the two have
become rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel finally resigned under pressure in October, and soon
afterward, Jean Lamy, considered to be a candidate to replace him,
was assassinated. No arrest has been made in the case. When Denize
went to Lamy's funeral, demonstrators loyal to Aristide disrupted
the service and heckled him.
</P>
<P>
   The events are an echo of old-style Haitian politics, with the
police leaders coming under relentless criticism by political
groups seeking to put their allies in key positions to gain an
advantage in legislative elections scheduled for March. The fear is
the police will be used to intimidate voters or to protect fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has always been the courting of the force by different
political parties,'' Denize said, casting an occasional glance at a
bank of security video monitors in his office.
</P>
<P>
   Colin Granderson, the executive director of the United
Nations/Organization of American States International Civilian
Mission in Haiti, said the pressures on the police are of special
concern at a time when the government is already functioning
without a Parliament or constitutionally appointed prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   The government has been virtually paralyzed for two years over
the refusal of an opposition legislation to approve a prime
minister and then the end of the legislative terms and a
postponement of new elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of concern about what is happening with the
police and if they are going to be destabilized or fall into the
clutches of Aristide,'' Granderson said. ``You are dealing with a
police force started from scratch and thrown into a cauldron. It is
not a propitious environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The force's top commanders, as well as other government
officials, insist they will not allow the police to become
politicized, a message they have sent repeatedly to the rank and
file. The officials are supported by international officials and
diplomats, who have conveyed a similar message to Aristide.
</P>
<P>
   Yvon Neptune, a spokesman for Fanmi Lavalas, suggested that some
of the recent disturbances, protesting a lack of security for
citizens, were the work of provocateurs and that his party was not
in a position to name police commanders. But he added that his
party's criticism of the police force's performance was legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way that the public is not feeling confident about what is
happening with security is the same way that Fanmi Lavalas is very
much concerned,'' he said. ``We as a political organization
questioned the situation. We have not contented ourselves to say
the police force is young and doesn't have enough material. We also
have to question those who are in charge, not only how they
perform, but what are their policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the streets of the capital, police officers are rarely
seen, except for a handful of officers in crisp blue-and-tan
uniforms directing traffic. There have been some brazen assaults,
like a recent robbery of a food wholesaler in which 10 armed men
exchanged gunfire with the police. Two robbers were killed, but the
rest escaped.
</P>
<P>
   Some downtown merchants are so fearful of crime that they allow
only one customer at a time into their stores, while many residents
stay inside in early morning and evening hours to avoid falling
prey to bandits.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a Dracula country,'' said Fredy Antoine, a mattress
salesman at the teeming Solomon Market. ``If you have a couple of
dollars in your pocket, anyone can come and tell you to give it to
them.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The man appointed prime minister after the legislature went out
of office, Jacques Alexis, said the original design of the police
force was part of the problem. ``When we asked for high school
diplomas for the new recruits, we ended up with people who saw the
police as a transitory position and who were waiting for the next
opportunity to move on when something better showed up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was the temptation of drug trafficking and other cases
of corruption,'' he said. ``That is why the next group of recruits
will be selected from candidates without high school diplomas who
see the police as a job where they feel valued and as a way to move
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexis also said that Haiti needs the files on political crimes
and human rights abuses committed by supporters of the coup against
Aristide because they might still be involved in criminal activity.
The documents were seized by American troops and have not been
released because they contain the names of American agents and
intelligence methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we could not prosecute all the cases,'' Alexis said.
``But the fact that the people who are still out on the street know
we have the files _ then perhaps that would be a means of
controlling them and calming them down.''
</P>
<P>
   While conceding that crime has increased, Denize said that it is
not as bad as in some other countries. He said the level of
violence is ``inexplicably low'' considering that most people in
the capital live crowded in poverty-wracked shantytowns. He said
some of the growing outcry about security comes from upper-class
residents who have lived comfortably in the hills overlooking
Port-au-Prince.
</P>
<P>
   These people, he said, traditionally were ``very well protected
by the army that served them and the repressive, dysfunctional
system that went with it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When this bulletproofing was no longer there, they fell prey
to criminality like everyone else,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The concerns over security, he said, must be seen as part of a
complex of problems facing the nation: an economic crisis,
criminals who are deported to Haiti from the United States and
Canada, and drug traffickers who can buy favors and silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have real social factors that put criminality on the
rise,'' he said. ``And it is a very democratic criminality.

ABORTION ISSUE BINDS AND SPLITS IN NEW YORK SENATE RACE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Abortion has emerged as a pivotal issue in the U.S.
Senate race in New York, even though the two presumed candidates,
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Hillary Rodham Clinton, have identical
positions on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani is coming under increasing pressure from the state
Conservative Party to change his stand from opposing a ban on a
form of late-term abortion. At the same time, the leader of New
York's most powerful abortion rights group said this week that the
mayor's strong support for their position would make it hard for
the group to endorse Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Although both candidates have something to lose on the issue _
Mrs. Clinton will not be happy if the abortion rights group remains
neutral in the race _ both Democrats and Republicans said this week
that it is Giuliani who seems backed into a corner.
</P>
<P>
   Kelli Conlin, the executive director of the New York State
affiliate of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action
League, known as NARAL, said she was ``personally very torn''
between ``two people who I know and like.'' She added that while
Mrs. Clinton ``has been a motivating force behind the most
pro-choice presidency in our history,'' Giuliani ``has really been
there for us'' and that ``it's really important for us, if he
stands by us, to support candidates like that, because they are a
minority in their party.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Conlin said that the New York affiliate of NARAL would
likely stay neutral in the Senate race as long as Giuliani
continues to oppose a ban on the late-term abortion procedure,
which is sometimes called partial-birth abortion by its opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Michelman, president of the national organization in
Washington, said her group might not take the same course. Ms.
Michelman went out of her way this week to praise Mrs. Clinton as
deserving of special consideration because of her longstanding and
steadfast support of abortion rights. ``Her strong advocacy might
set her apart a little, even though both of them are pro-choice,''
Ms. Michelman said.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, Michael R. Long, the chairman of the state
Conservative Party, continues to insist that Giuliani must change
his position on late-term abortion before the mayor can receive the
party's endorsement in the Senate race. The endorsement is crucial
_ no Republican since Sen. Jacob Javits in 1974 has won statewide
office in New York without it _ and carries with it an estimated
200,000 to 300,000 votes. Those votes could be the margin of
victory in a race as close as the one between Mrs. Clinton and
Giuliani is expected to be.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Conlin, who served on Giuliani's transition team after his
1993 election as mayor, met last month with Mrs. Clinton and then
later with Bruce Teitelbaum, the director of the mayor's Senate
exploratory committee. Mrs. Clinton asked for the abortion rights
group's support, Ms. Conlin said. Ms. Conlin told Mrs. Clinton that
``no one has declared at this point, a lot is going to shake out
eventually, and right now we're going to have to wait.''
</P>
<P>
   In her meeting with Teitelbaum, Ms. Conlin said that she tried
to ``clarify'' the issue of late-term abortion in the hope that
Teitelbaum would take her views to the mayor. ``I have no
indication whatsoever that the mayor is wavering,'' Ms. Conlin
said. ``I just know the pressure he is under.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the mayor's position appears firm: Earlier this month,
Giuliani told The Albany Times-Union that he would not support a
ban on late-term abortions and that he supports the state's
abortion law. ``New York shouldn't be ashamed of the law,''
Giuliani said. ``That law, I think, is a fair one and works to
create the necessary scope of freedom and prohibition.''
</P>
<P>
   At a City Hall news conference this week, Giuliani brushed off a
question about late-term abortion, saying that ``my position on
abortion is precisely the same today as it was yesterday. I haven't
changed overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   If the mayor holds to his position, he risks hundreds of
thousands of conservative votes. And members of both parties say it
is unlikely that he could make them up with women voters attracted
to his abortion rights position or people who might admire him for
sticking to principle.
</P>
<P>
   If the mayor changes his position, he risks relentless bulletins
from Mrs. Clinton's campaign of flip-flopping and accusations that
he yielded in a cynical display of political expediency. ``He's got
to evaluate if he does change his position what negative fallout
there would be,'' said Guy Molinari, the Staten Island borough
president, who is a close friend and Republican ally of the mayor.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Long first announced his endorsement conditions for the mayor
last summer, and almost immediately Giuliani called asking if he
was willing to discuss the issue. Long said yes. But that was in
early August, and since then, as Long has repeated his position on
television and to reporters, the mayor has responded with silence.
Long now sounds increasingly impatient.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party is still open, we're willing to discuss the issue,
but quite frankly, the clock is starting to tick,'' Long said. He
added that his party's convention to decide on an endorsement is in
May, and that if the mayor should decide in, say, April, to change
his position, that would be too late.
</P>
<P>
   Long also said that he was not overly impressed with recent
actions by Giuliani that theoretically might have pleased him:
Cutting off financing for the Brooklyn Museum of Art for an exhibit
that the mayor deemed pornographic, a speech at the Reagan Library
lauding the former president and endorsements of upstate Republican
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not exactly talking about a movement conservative,''
Long said. ``That's the problem. All of the sudden it's campaign
time and he starts doing a few little things on the edges, and
people start saying, `Gee, he's moving onto Republican things.' But
I've watched him for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Conservative Party has something to lose by not
endorsing Giuliani _ its members have been awarded jobs in the
administrations of Republicans, like Gov. George Pataki, whom they
endorsed _ patronage is less important in a Senate race because a
senator controls relatively few jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Long, meanwhile, says that his party will run someone else on
its ticket if his members do not endorse the mayor. He also said he
is operating on principle. ``In my belief, it's about saving a
partially born baby,'' Long said.
</P>
<P>
   Medically, the abortion procedure at issue is called intact
dilation and evacuation, because the feet of the fetus are
extracted first and the skull is broken before being suctioned
through the birth canal.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Senate has voted twice to ban late-term abortion, but
both measures were vetoed by President Clinton. As of last month,
30 states had enacted their own bans, although 17 of the bans had
been blocked or overturned by federal courts as unconstitutional.
Opponents of such bans say they are part of a conservative strategy
to limit abortion rights in general, and that the language of the
bans is written so broadly as to outlaw most abortion procedures
after the first trimester of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's position on the issue is in fact more liberal than
some other Republicans and Democrats who support abortion rights.
Those politicians who favor abortion rights and also a ban on
late-term abortion include Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New
York Democrat who is leaving the seat expected to be sought by Mrs.
Clinton and Giuliani; Edward Koch, the former Democratic mayor of
New York City; and Susan Molinari, the former Republican
congresswoman from Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   Although Giuliani, a Roman Catholic, once advocated that the
Supreme Court overturn Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 decision that
legalized abortion, he changed his position in his first race for
mayor in 1989. His opponents said it was merely an exercise to get
votes in a Democratic city, but Fran Reiter, who was at the time an
adviser to Giuliani and the chairwoman of the Liberal Party in New
York City, disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess in a very cynical way you could look at it that way,
which is, this is New York City, you have to be pro-choice,'' she
said. ``But he's gone way beyond being pro-choice.''
</P>
<P>
   It is in fact Ms. Reiter and Ms. Conlin who say they helped
Giuliani formulate his public position on abortion in 1989. Ms.
Reiter, who became a deputy mayor under Giuliani, also says that
she helped Giuliani arrive at his position, around 1997, on
late-term abortion. ``He took a look at what the law currently was
in the state,'' Ms. Reiter said. ``He was perfectly comfortable''
with that.

MORE MARQUEE MOUNTS SOMEHOW PASS BY PINCAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Laffit Pincay continues his record pursuit
this weekend while Hollywood Park holds its annual Turf Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Sad to say, one attraction has very little to do with the other.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay, 11 wins from Bill Shoemaker's career-record 8,833, is
scheduled to ride in only one of the six stakes that make up the
Turf Festival today, Saturday and Sunday. And Pincay's lone mount,
Reba's Gold in Saturday's Generous Stakes, is not considered a
contender in that $200,000 race for 2-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   The scarcity of strong mounts in the richest races is an old
story for Pincay, who missed the Triple Crown and the Breeders' Cup
this year and hasn't ridden a Grade I stakes winner since Tactical
Cat in the 1998 Hollywood Futurity.
</P>
<P>
   But these days it's especially poignant, because Pincay should
be center-stage as his big moment approaches, and puzzling, because
he's riding as well as anybody on the circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay is too classy to complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't frustrate me. I understand,'' Pincay said Wednesday
in the Hollywood Park jockeys' room. ``There are a lot of good
riders here. Most of the stables have their own riders that they
ride.''
</P>
<P>
   He realizes he loses a few would-be mounts because he can't work
with horses during morning training as often as some jockeys do.
His 850-calories-a-day diet and personal fitness routine requires
him to conserve energy for the afternoons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I quit going in the mornings because I had to, not because I
wanted to. As hard as I was dieting, I just couldn't do it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Pincay, who will turn 53 on Dec. 29, thinks his age has
become an issue in the past few years for some of the trainers and
owners who pass him over for younger jockeys.
</P>
<P>
   He admits to feeling ``a little satisfaction'' when he has been
replaced following a horse's poor performance, and the horse runs
badly under the new rider, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``You say, `I wonder who they're blaming now,''' Pincay said
with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   After finishing third in the Oak Tree jockey standings, Pincay
(with nine wins) was second to Pat Valenzuela (10) at Hollywood
Park going into the Thanksgiving Day races, where he won twice.
Pincay's 22.5 winning percentage was the best at the 11-days-old
meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to feel that I'm not just hanging on to break
the record,'' Pincay said.
</P>
<P>
   So why does Pincay _ winner of a Kentucky Derby (Swale, 1984),
three Belmont Stakes, seven Breeders' Cup races, seven Hollywood
Gold Cups and 13 million-dollar races _ have (as of mid-week) only
one mount in the $2.1 million Turf Festival?
</P>
<P>
   Was it so long ago that he was a fixture in the Turf Festival
races, winning the Citation Handicap three times, including both
divisions in 1991 with Notorious Pleasure and Fly Till Dawn;
winning the Matriarch twice, most recently in 1994 aboard Exchange;
and the Hollywood Derby and Hollywood Turf Express once each?
</P>
<P>
   Why do younger riders who have accomplished none of the above
even once have two or three mounts? Hall of Famer Chris McCarron
and Corey Nakatani will be busiest with five each.
</P>
<P>
   Agent Bob Meldahl said he can't understand why Pincay doesn't
get stakes mounts anymore. The fact Pincay is climbing an exercise
machine instead of exercising horses most mornings doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's a stakes horse and someone wants him to work him, he's
here,'' Meldahl said.
</P>
<P>
   But Meldahl can do the math. A lot of good riders scramble for
mounts at Hollywood Park, Santa Anita and Del Mar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like New York, where they have four top riders,''
Meldahl said. ``Here we have 10 _ for six-horse races.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, because Pincay rides at 117 pounds, heavier than most
local jockeys, he loses some stakes horses who are assigned lower
weights. Reba's Gold is supposed to carry 114 in the 1-mile
Generous. Trainer Dan Hendricks said he isn't bothered by the three
pounds of overweight.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had five more (Turf Festival horses), I'd give them to
him (Pincay),'' Hendricks said.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay would have ridden Daytime for trainer Kathy Walsh in the
$500,000 Hollywood Derby, but that horse won't make the 14-horse
field. So Pincay will go to Turf Paradise in Phoenix on Sunday to
ride Kits Peak for trainer Walter Greenman in a $75,000 race called
the Queen of the Green Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   A mile to the title?: The Cigar Mile at Aqueduct on Saturday
could decide the Horse of the Year title.
</P>
<P>
   Artax, one of the handful of horses with a chance to win the
January vote, needs to win the race to prove he's not a
one-dimensional sprinter, albeit a record-setting sprinter.
</P>
<P>
   The 4-year-old won 1 1/16-mile races at the maiden and stakes
levels at ages 2 and 3, including the 1998 Santa Catalina and San
Felipe at Santa Anita. But since then he has been no better than
third in five races beyond sprint distances, most recently a
fifth-place finish in an optional claimer in March that preceded
his move east.
</P>
<P>
   Artax's New York opponents, receiving four to 10 pounds, include
Crafty Friend, who has beaten him twice.
</P>
<P>

Derby.... Hollywood Park and the Daily Racing Form sponsor a
handicapping contest Saturday and Sunday. The top four will earn a
spot in a national championship contest Jan. 7-8 in Las Vegas; the
top 10 will split $10,000 in prize money. &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The two most famous students of the Bill Clinton
political school _ Hillary Rodham Clinton and Al Gore _ have
finally graduated. But now that they are out on their own, they
seem to be sticking to the same textbook.
</P>
<P>
   That they are approaching their races in like-minded ways should
come as no surprise: They both are smart, ambitious and determined
_ and saddled with demanding day jobs. Yet they can be a bit
tone-deaf politically.
</P>
<P>
   So why wouldn't they soak up the wisdom of their mentor, a
world-class instinctive politician and tactician?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's advisers said he spent more time talking with his wife
about her race for the Senate from New York than he did with Gore
about his bid for president. But they said he did not hesitate to
pick up the telephone with tips for the Gore high command as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's more involved in her campaign than Al's,'' one Clinton
adviser said. ``It's his wife _ he spends more time with her.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Clinton said he had advised Mrs. Clinton to declare her
intention to run this week, rather than waiting until January, to
quiet speculation that she would quit the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always think if there's any doubt and you can resolve it,
you ought to do it,'' Clinton told reporters here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how much Gore and Mrs. Clinton are talking to Clinton
_ or heeding his advice _ the similarities between the two
candidates' approaches became obvious when Mrs. Clinton announced
on Tuesday that she would, indeed, run for the Senate and that she
planned to move to Chappaqua as soon as she could.
</P>
<P>
   In saying that she would not give up her duties as first lady
entirely, Mrs. Clinton sounded like Gore, who in late September
announced that he was shifting his campaign headquarters to
Nashville, Tenn., while not totally forfeiting his duties as vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have two really high-profile people and two really
high-profile races _ and they're both having to come to grips with
a problem that every politician has had to face: They have one job
and want another one,'' said James Carville, an architect of
Clinton's victory in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   So far, it has not been easy for Mrs. Clinton and Gore, both of
whom have botched the preliminary stages of their campaigns. Things
got so bad for Gore that he had to move up the date he announced
his candidacy and reinvent his entire operation. Mrs. Clinton also
moved up her unofficial announcement _ to this week _ to tamp down
rumors that things were going so feebly that she was ready to quit.
</P>
<P>
   Now, both contenders hope to follow this playbook that will put
them on a road to victory:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bill who? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Gore would not dare quit his day job, just as Mrs. Clinton has
always stood by her man. But both are trying to establish their own
identities by rarely mentioning their mentor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to shine when you're standing next to the sun,''
said David Axelrod, a Democratic strategist in Chicago. ``And they
both need some distance to get away from the luminescence of the
president, which kind of diminishes everything around him.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not just Clinton's luminescence that some worry about.
There is also the concern that the scandals of his administration
will stain his wife and the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking, perhaps, to convey the notion that she was running her
own show, Mrs. Clinton said she had not even alerted her husband
and her daughter, Chelsea, who were traveling overseas, of her
announcement on Tuesday. ``They're in Kosovo, and they don't know
about this,'' she said, although her remarks did not square with
those of her husband the following day.
</P>
<P>
   There are differences in approach between Gore and Mrs. Clinton.
While Gore has repeatedly and publicly upbraided Clinton for the
Monica Lewinsky scandal, Mrs. Clinton has said nothing negative
about her husband. She said she would ``absolutely'' welcome his
campaigning for her; Gore said he was not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is not in any way distancing herself from the president;
that would be absurd,'' said Mandy Grunwald, a strategist for Mrs.
Clinton. ``He's married to her. She loves him.''
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, Mrs. Clinton and Gore are also driven by
different political imperatives. One reason Mrs. Clinton wants her
husband to stump for her in New York is that the president is
popular in the state. But Gore has to win over voters around the
country, including states where voters are furious at the
president.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Take credit for the good things. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   While they are reluctant to cite Clinton, Gore and Mrs. Clinton
are happy to tout what they say are the achievements of his
administration. Had Clinton not vetoed the Republican budget plan,
Mrs. Clinton said on Tuesday, it ``would have been the beginning of
a U-turn back to where we came from in the 1980s: of fiscal
irresponsibility, of the failure to invest in our children and our
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also cited a U-turn when he announced that he was moving
his campaign to Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the challenge that we face in the 21st century,'' he
said, ``is to keep that prosperity going and prevent those who are
trying to take us on a right-wing U-turn back to the old
supply-side approach from being able to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Just the same, both candidates are staying clear of White House
issues that would complicate their campaigns. Mrs. Clinton, for
instance, has said little publicly about how much federal money
should go to hospitals in New York, while Gore has tried not to get
mired in the debate over trade with China.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Repeat a mantra about children and families. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Mrs. Clinton sound many of the same themes. Perhaps it
is not a surprise, given that they have shared a pollster, Mark
Penn, although Penn no longer works for the vice president.
Everywhere they go, the candidates talk about education, health
care, protecting Social Security. And always, they bring up
children and families.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in western Iowa on Tuesday, Gore said, ``I'd like
people to say after a Gore presidency: He was honest and he fought
his heart out for what was right for families in this country.''
That same day, at a news conference in New York, Mrs. Clinton said
the election was ``going to be about the issues that concern the
people of New York, and particularly the children and families of
New York.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Remember those White House perks. &LR;

   Gore and Mrs. Clinton are trying to use their day jobs to best
advantage. Gore is seeking to embark on more ``official'' vice
presidential trips in order to save his campaign money. And Mrs.
Clinton has also made full use of her official entourage and
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   While both candidates have been criticized by their opponents as
skirting campaign-finance laws, neither has apologized for their
large motorcades and security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of what I have to do is listen to the Secret Service and
follow their direction,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``It would be
irresponsible for me to do otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   As the campaigns heat up, even if Clinton's proteges call for
advice, the White House may become a bit lonely, if not awkward,
for him. Already, his weekly lunches with Gore have been put on
hold because of the vice president's travel schedule. As for life
upstairs without his wife, Clinton remarked, ``We'll have to make
accommodations.''

<P>
   KAHENGE, Namibia _ With fighting between rebels and government
forces escalating along the southern edge of Angola, thousands
living in the area, long an Angolan rebel stronghold, have fled
across the river border over the last nine days and taken refuge
outside the police station in this rural village.
</P>
<P>
   But with no toilets, few tents and only one water faucet for the
more than 2,300 refugees encamped here, the government has been
scrambling to move them before the seasonal rains, which are
expected to begin any day and which could turn the unsanitary
environment here into a public health emergency.
</P>
<P>
   For the Namibian government, presidential and legislative
elections next week make the situation all the more urgent. The
police station in this village is a polling site, and the last
thing authorities want, they say, is a mass of refugees to confuse
or inhibit voters in the area, which is a stronghold for the
governing party.
</P>
<P>
   But efforts to bus refugees south to a resettlement camp in
central Namibia have so far failed, despite the presence of more
than 5,000 fellow Angolans at the camp, in a town called Osire.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands more Angolans are believed to be dispersed throughout
northern Namibia, many staying with relatives, so this country is
not unaccustomed to refugees from its neighbor. But the stream of
people crossing the Okavango River this month is greater than ever,
authorities say. ``We have never had anything like this here,''
said Hesdy Rathling, who heads the Namibia office of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday afternoon, when buses arrived to begin taking
refugees to Osire, the first family took almost a half-hour to load
themselves and their belongings. By Wednesday evening only 98
people had boarded camp-bound buses, and Thursday just 269 people
made the trip.
</P>
<P>
   The influx of Angolans, which began Nov. 16, is a result of a
major Angolan offensive in a 25-year-old war with the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola, known by its Portuguese
acronym, UNITA. In recent weeks the Angolan authorities have
claimed major victories over the rebels, asserting that they are
close to capturing or killing the Unita leader, Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
   Cuandocubango, the Angolan region across the river from the
swelling refugee camp, has been a UNITA stronghold and generally
out of the government's reach, but from the refugees' vague
accounts of fighting there, Angolan government forces have made
inroads against the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Paolo Bongi, said he had fled a village a few miles away from
here. ``I ran away from the fighting, from the MPLA,'' Bongi, 23,
said through an interpreter, referring to the government army by
the initials for the governing party, the Popular Movement for the
Liberation of Angola. ``I want to stay in Namibia because it's not
good in Angola.''
</P>
<P>
   Veronica Cambinda sat nearby, in the shade of one of the giant
fig trees that provide the only relief from the 98-degree heat. She
said her seven children and several other relatives had felt
compelled to leave their village, Mangonda. ``The soldiers of UNITA
every day were killing people,'' she said as she braided a friend's
hair, with her year-old son rolling around on her lap.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly women, small children and elderly men, the refugees
arrived here in Namibia not only with their tattered blankets and
rusting pots but with their herds of livestock. Thousands of
cattle, hundreds of goats and dozens of chickens, pigs and dogs
wander the sand-swept fields outside the police station. What to do
with the animals is just one complication facing the government as
it tries to move the refugees to the Osire resettlement camp.
</P>
<P>
   Separated from Namibia by nationality but not by ethnicity, many
of the refugees have said that they want to stay in the Namibian
northern border area, which is home to thousands of fellow Cuangari
and Nyemba people, many of them relatives. Despite what Namibian
officials describe as Osire's better housing and facilities, few
refugees want to be bused to Osire, more than 360 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   But the government says it cannot allow the people to stay here,
because the site is ripe for an outbreak of cholera. Even if
adequate water and sanitation could be provided, the site is too
close to the fighting, Niilo Taapopi, Namibia's permanent secretary
for home affairs, said this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a stone's throw away,'' he said after an emergency
meeting with aid workers and government officials. ``If somebody
wanted to attack it, it's just across the water.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a plea from Taapopi, who came to the camp this week, the
refugees remained reluctant and the effort to relocate them got off
to a slow and confusing start, which was compounded by a shortage
of buses.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with the rest, quickly, is a pressing problem for the
government. ``We want the elections to be free and fair,'' Taapopi
said.

POLICE SEIZE NEW EVIDENCE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOORPARK, Calif. _ Investigators have seized new evidence from a
hilltop mansion where three brothers were shot to death this week,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Several deputies served a search warrant Thursday at the home of
Dr. Xavier J. Caro and his wife, Socorro ``Cora'' Caro, said a
Ventura County sheriff's spokesman, providing no details about the
additional evidence taken.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Socorro Caro remains hospitalized after the multiple
shootings, with no change in her condition since she was upgraded
Wednesday from critical to serious condition.
</P>
<P>
   Deputies went to the Presilla Drive house on Thursday morning,
said sheriff's Deputy Eric Nishimoto, a department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We served a search warrant on the house and went in to pull a
few additional things,'' he said. ``It's not that unusual that
something that may not have seemed significant the first time
around becomes significant, so they're just going back to collect
some more things from the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Nishimoto said he didn't know the types or quantity of items the
investigators were checking.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have named no suspect in the case, and Nishimoto
said he could not forecast when an arrest might be made. ``We're
sifting through a mountain of evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Socorro Caro has been in Los Robles Regional Medical Center in
Thousand Oaks since she was taken there after her husband, a
prominent rheumatologist in the Los Angeles area of Northridge,
reported the shootings about 11:20 p.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her condition remains the same _ serious and stable,'' said
hospital spokeswoman Kris Carraway-Bowman. ``She is going through
constant evaluation by her physician.''
</P>
<P>
   Xavier ``Joe'' Caro Jr., 11, was found dead in his bedroom, and
Michael Caro, 8, and Christopher Laurence Caro, 5, were found dead
in the room they shared.
</P>
<P>
   Their mother was found in another room with a single shot to the
head. An infant brother was unharmed. Xavier Caro has been
questioned by investigators, but no charges have been filed.
</P>
<P>
   The children's bodies were removed from the Ventura County
Medical Examiner's Office in Ventura to the Conejo Mountain Funeral
Home in Camarillo on Thursday morning, said Senior Deputy Coroner
Craig Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral arrangements were pending.

CANADIAN ENERGY FIRM CRITICIZED FOR INVESTMENT IN SUDAN

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Jim Buckee would like Talisman Energy Inc. of Calgary,
Alberta, to be known as a true Canadian success story, a company
that has increased oil and gas production by 30 percent a year
since the mid-1990s by reaching beyond its prairie base to develop
wells in the North Sea, Indonesia and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   But its investment in Sudan has become a huge public relations
problem for Buckee, the president of Talisman, Canada's largest
independent oil and gas producer. Full-scale oil production in
Sudan has just begun and the company is under attack by
representatives of church and civil servant pension funds in the
United States and Canada for abetting a government that, according
to a U.N. report, is guilty of genocide and other abuses of human
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Heading the list of critics are Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and Rep. Donald Payne, D-N.J. The Interfaith Center on
Corporate Responsibility, a church coalition based in New York, and
the Task Force of Churches for Corporate Responsibility in Canada
have also been speaking out against Talisman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why us?'' Buckee asks. ``We are a business, we are not in
politics, and we can only affect things within our sphere of
influence.'' The holdings in Sudan amount to only 10 percent of
Talisman's total assets.
</P>
<P>
   Some pension funds have been selling their holdings. So despite
the recent rise in oil prices and Talisman's flush earnings this
year compared with losses the year before, the company's stock has
been lagging. At Wednesday's close of $26.9375 on the New York
Stock Exchange, it was 19 percent percent off its 52-week high
reached less than three months ago. About one-quarter of Talisman's
shares are owned by Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But not all investors are expressing their disapproval by
selling. Others, including members of the Canadian Task Force of
Churches, continue to hold their shares in the hope of forcing
Talisman to adopt a stricter code of ethics. The Rev. Tim Ryan, a
Catholic priest in Toronto, says this approach worked with Shell
Petroleum NV in Nigeria, where the company was accused by critics
of abetting a repressive government.
</P>
<P>
   The task force wants Talisman to ``adopt a corporate code that
includes human rights in it,'' Ryan says. ``If you have that, and
you're a force for improving the situation, what are your
objectives and strategies? And can you produce an audited result of
what impact you're having? If you can't operate without violating
human rights, the only option is to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   The church group tried to get a human rights motion relating to
Sudan on the agenda at Talisman's annual meeting last spring, but
it was rejected. Another attempt will be made next spring, and
management has indicated it may be more accommodating.
</P>
<P>
   Talisman's Sudan problem came with the purchase just over a year
ago of Arakis Energy Corp., a small Canadian company whose main
asset was an oil property in Sudan. For almost two decades, Sudan
has been devastated by a civil war that has pitted northern
Muslims, who control the government, against Christian rebels in
the south.
</P>
<P>
   It is estimated that between 1.5 million and 2 million people
have been killed, and millions more displaced _ some, according to
the U.N. report, to make way for the oil development at two fields
and construction of a 1,000-mile pipeline to a port on the Red Sea.
Talisman has 25 percent of the oil and pipeline development, while
the national oil companies of China and Malaysia have 40 and 30
percent, respectively. A Sudanese company holds the remainder.
</P>
<P>
   The answer to Buckee's ``why us?'' question is simple enough,
says Stuart McDowall, a 37-year veteran of Canada's Foreign Service
who is now Talisman's director of public relations for the Sudan
operation. China and Malaysia routinely pay little heed to human
rights complaints and ``we are the only recognizable Western
face.''
</P>
<P>
   While there is no denying the trauma caused by the war, McDowall
says there was no removal of people from the oil field. ``There was
no need to. We operate on a vast plain that is flooded with one or
two meters of water for three months during the rainy season,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   McDowall also says the oil consortium has helped the local
population by providing 1,000 jobs, paying for a 60-bed hospital,
building roads to move goods to market and drilling more than 50
water wells.
</P>
<P>
   He says Talisman does not have a campaign to counter its
critics, although earlier this month it flew a group of 20 oil
analysts and reporters from Canada and the United States to Sudan
for a look at the project. Some glowing investment reports on
Talisman have been written as a result.
</P>
<P>
   No thought is being given to pulling out of Sudan, McDowall
says. ``We're very happy with the country and the project. We're
confident that as people look into the situation and visit Sudan
the truth will come out.''

ANALYSIS: GERMANY'S CONSENSUS ECONOMY AT RISK OF UNRAVELING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder could scarcely
conceal a triumphant grin as he announced a $2.2 billion bailout of
Germany's biggest construction company on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The banks, and I say this with the utmost respect, accepted
their economic and social responsibility,'' he said after
browbeating a consortium of banks to reverse its previous decision
against rescuing the builder, Philipp Holzmann AG.
</P>
<P>
   But in reality, this has been a disastrous week for Germany's
``consensus economy'' and the deeply rooted idea that capitalism's
hard edges should be moderated though a partnership of business,
labor and government.
</P>
<P>
   Since Monday, consensus capitalism has been assaulted on two
distinct but closely related fronts: the hostile bid for Mannesmann
AG, the engineering and telecommunications concern, and the
collapse of Holzmann, a huge industrial enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   First came the shock of the $127.7 billion hostile takeover
offer for Mannesmann, one of Germany's most successful companies,
by Vodafone AirTouch of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone's bid has unleashed a political outcry here about
``casino capitalism,'' ruthless corporate ``sharks'' and the
reckless destruction of ``corporate culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came the collapse of Holzmann, a 150-year-old pillar of
German industry that employs 17,000 people but has been mismanaged
for years.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Schroeder's last-minute pressure and government loan
guarantees of 250 million marks, or $131 million, Holzmann will
indeed be rescued with its second major bailout in two years.
</P>
<P>
   But the rescue cannot undo the effect of events leading up to
it. In a departure from previous rescues, German banks were unable
to agree on a bailout after several rounds of talks.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank, Holzmann's biggest creditor and biggest
shareholder, tried to arrange the bailout but ran into blunt and
bruising criticism from other banks that simply refused to go
along.
</P>
<P>
   The banks repeatedly ignored political pressure and cries of
outrage from unions, forcing Holzmann to file for bankruptcy on
Wednesday. Only the combination of government sweeteners and
Schroeder's intervention turned them around.
</P>
<P>
   Though different, the Holzmann and Mannesmann cases both reveal
how far German business has evolved from ``Rhineland capitalism,''
a system based on tightly intertwined networks of banks, industrial
manufacturers and powerful labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   That system, epitomized by the role that Deutsche Bank tried to
take in rescuing Holzmann, is grounded on the idea that all the
major players in the economy work together in pursuit of consensus
rather than conflict.
</P>
<P>
   It assumed that banks would finance industry and come to the
rescue in times of need. It assumed that corporations would respect
one another's territory, partly because the big banks are
shareholders in the biggest industrial companies.
</P>
<P>
   It also assumed that corporations would avoid conflict with
labor. Wages would be set through nationwide negotiations between
industry and labor. Unions would have a direct hand in corporate
``co-determination'' _ with representation on corporate supervisory
boards and union-controlled ``work councils'' that approve many
day-to-day decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that remains in force today. But the once-solid
alliances are breaking apart under the pressure of global
competition, international shareholders and Western Europe's own
unstoppable process of economic integration.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Germany Inc. was in a clear state of unraveling
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone's hostile takeover bid for Mannesmann, aimed at
creating the world's biggest wireless communications company,
provoked almost predictable accusations about Anglo-Saxon raiders
intent merely on breaking up successful companies.
</P>
<P>
   This week's cover on the German business magazine Wirtschaft
Woche harks back to the Allies' D-Day assault on Normandy in World
War II, featuring an army of businessmen rushing onto a beach. The
headline was ``Invasion! Attack on the consensus society.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the attempted takeover came from a British company
appeared to provoke less anger than the hostile nature of the
attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Unions and political leaders, including Schroeder, darkly warned
that the hostile bid would lead to the dismemberment of a
successful company and the loss of jobs. The chancellor said
hostile takeovers ``destroy a company's culture'' and warned that
aspiring predators ``should not underestimate the power of German
co-determination.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet as the week progressed, Schroeder's government provided
little hint of interference. Werner Mueller, the economics
minister, warned against letting nationalism dominate the
discussion, noting that German companies had bought many major
foreign corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Hans Eichel, Germany's finance minister, suggested that the
European Union needed to harmonize its rules governing takeovers.
But he studiously avoided any suggestion that hostile takeovers be
restricted.
</P>
<P>
   All that could change. Schroeder is a man of chameleonlike
views, not at all worried about reversing his positions if the
political winds seem to call for doing so.
</P>
<P>
   From the standpoint of many German companies, it is clearly
dangerous to erect new obstacles. In the last two years, Volkswagen
has acquired Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, Deutsche Bank has acquired
Bankers Trust in New York, and Daimler-Benz has acquired Chrysler.
Mannesmann has itself been one of the most active foreign
acquirers, buying control of large cellular telephone companies in
Italy and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   It was a measure of how much things have changed that the leader
of Allianz AG, the German insurance giant that is at the heart of
the country's system of interlocking corporate ownership, adamantly
defended hostile takeovers this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hostile takeovers in Europe must not be a taboo,'' said
Henning Schulte-Noelle, chairman of Allianz, in an interview with
the newspaper Les Echos. ``The change of ownership of a company is
a matter of value and not of the national flag,'' he added. ``From
now on our domestic market is Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of Holzmann provided a dramatic counterpoint to the
debate about ``consensus'' capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   Holzmann, a company with $7 billion in sales and a substantial
international presence, has been losing money for the last four
years, thanks to a steep downturn in the construction business and
real estate prices.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank led a major financial overhaul in 1997, installing
Heinrich Binder as its chief executive and naming one of its board
members as chairman of the Holzmann supervisory board.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those efforts, Holzmann shocked its creditors and
shareholders last week by announcing that it had suddenly
discovered 2.4 billion marks' worth of soured loans dating back to
the early 1990s _ most for eastern German real estate. Why the bad
loans remained hidden until now is a matter being investigated by
German prosecutors and furious investors. Binder has blamed his
predecessors for the problems.
</P>
<P>
   But there seems little doubt that Holzmann is a sick company
that has been less than candid with both investors and creditors.
Commerzbank, one of the banks that balked at another bailout,
argued that much of the blame also rested with Deutsche Bank, which
assumed a paternalistic role and yet remained oblivious to the
problems.
</P>
<P>
   To the surprise of many, the banks not only failed to agree on a
bailout but angrily attacked both Holzmann and Deutsche Bank for
the mess. Talks broke down last week, then again on Sunday and once
again on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder then swooped into town Wednesday evening, vowing to
bridge the gap and bringing government loan guarantees to smooth
the talks. The guarantees, plus the intense glare of publicity and
the pressure from thousands of protesting workers, finally turned
the tide.
</P>
<P>
   Yet on Thursday the reaction was decidedly mixed. ``If companies
in the future do what they want, and the state comes in at the end
with 250 million marks in help, that cannot make any sense for a
social market economy,'' said Mario Ohoven, president of the German
federation of ``mittelsstand'' or middle-size companies. ``If that
happens, we will have a state-run economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the developments for both Mannesmann and
Holzmann struck many Germans as bookends to the changes coursing
through their once-orderly economy.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody seemed happy about either hostile takeovers or the abrupt
collapse of a company employing 17,000 people in Germany. But not
many people had good feelings about the alternatives either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week, in the case of Mannesmann, one could still think
that the barbarians lurked outside'' the workplace of Germany Inc.,
wrote Andreas Molitor in Germany's weekly newspaper of opinion, Die
Zeit. ``But since the collapse of Philipp Holzmann, it is clear
that that barbarians are also right in our own midst.''

COMMENTARY: HILLARY'S ROOTLESSNESS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By GAIL COLLINS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New Yorkers regard themselves as the most interesting
topic in the universe. Therefore, we were gratified to learn that
the much-discussed U.S. Senate campaign here is actually going to
be all about us, us, us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe this election will be about me or my
opponent,'' said Hillary Clinton, the best-known woman on the
planet. ``Instead, it will be about the people of the state.'' She
added that she would be asking New Yorkers ``to vote for
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's a trip to the polling place one could truly enjoy
for a change. So far, however, this particular race has not been
about us at all. It's been about foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton recently got into hot water for failing to respond
promptly when Yasser Arafat's wife made an anti-Israeli speech in
her presence. The first lady's reaction wasn't all that surprising
when you think of how much training she's had in sitting through
unpleasant addresses with a tight smile on her face. But the Arafat
imbroglio did highlight one of her weaknesses as a candidate. Mrs.
Clinton has attempted to become more like New Yorkers, rooting for
the Yankees and buying a ridiculously expensive residence that she
really can't afford. But she does not seem to have acquired any
ethnicity. (``Protestant?'' guessed one supporter at a recent
teachers' union rally.) Her campaign spokesman admits he has no
idea where Mrs. Clinton's roots lie.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the way we do business here. A New Yorker whose
ancestors left Bavaria in 1840 and intermarried with Belgians will
still get nostalgic about the Steuben Day Parade, and demand to
know what the next U.S. senator is going to do about the Walloon
situation. Mrs. Clinton took one small step forward when she
discovered that her maternal grandmother's second husband was
Jewish, but more probing is certainly needed.
</P>
<P>
   All New York mayors regard themselves as ambassadors to
everywhere. (``It's me! I'm here!'' Mayor Ed Koch called to the
Germans from across the Berlin Wall.) Rudy Giuliani is particularly
interested in Israel, whose government he seems to identify with
his own administration. The Palestinians are stuck in the role of
one of those troublesome sets of New Yorkers who require a firm
hand, like jaywalkers or homeless people who want a bed in a city
shelter. When visiting Israel for the second time in his life in
1996, the mayor advised Prime Minister Shimon Peres not to ``go
romanticizing'' Arafat. ``Don't forget who he is,'' the mayor said
in an unsolicited pep talk.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani was, of course, critical of Mrs. Clinton's handling of
the Israeli situation. He demonstrated his own approach in 1995,
when he had Arafat ejected from a New York Philharmonic concert in
honor of the United Nations. Nobel Peace Prize winner or not,
Giuliani said, the Palestinian leader was still a terrorist to him.
``I don't forget,'' the mayor added, expressing an attitude that
has always proved useful in international trouble spots.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Carl Kruger, a Brooklyn Democrat, made the network
news this week when he announced that Mrs. Clinton's behavior had
persuaded him to endorse Giuliani. (Democratic state senators in
New York, who have all the power and prestige of thumbtacks,
normally get on TV only if they stand on Rockefeller Plaza and wave
at Katie Couric.) The Clinton camp volleyed back a statement from
that well-known expert on American foreign policy, Ed Koch, who
said Kruger should be ashamed of himself.
</P>
<P>
   Any questions?
</P>
<P>
   The mayor attempts to avoid mentioning Mrs. Clinton in public _
except for those not infrequent moments when she's made an
embarrassing error. But his fund-raising literature isn't so shy.
``Dear Friend,'' a recent mass-mailing begins. ``If you don't want
to see Hillary Rodham Clinton in the United States Senate, I need
your immediate support.'' The letter, which includes 10 references
to ``Clinton'' and five to ``left-wing'' or ``left-wing elite,''
was sent to one of those exclusive lists that politicians purchase
_ say, all Americans with indoor plumbing. The one I'm looking at
was mailed to his friend The New York Times Reference Library. The
computer added a personal note, asking Reference Lib if she ``would
like to be invited to meet with Rudy when he travels to the New
York, NY area?''
</P>
<P>
   No. But maybe in Tel Aviv, or Bangkok.

 &HT;    Candlelight service replaces Texas A&AMP;M bonfire
 &HT;    By Christian Davenport
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ With a setting sun and candlelight
replacing the annual Texas A&AMP;M University bonfire, an estimated
70,000 people came here Thursday to memorialize the students killed
in last week's crash of the bonfire structure.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying candles, they stood soundlessly at the site where the
40-foot, cake-like bonfire stack came crashing down on Nov. 18,
killing 12 and injuring 27. The hand-held flames formed a
flickering ring around the site.
</P>
<P>
   The vigil was in stark contrast to the normal revelry that
charges this college town on the eve before the heralded football
game against the University of Texas. Normally, thousands gather
around the massive bonfire, which can reach 55-feet high, cheer
their team, and hold a ``yell practice,'' where they rehearse their
team's chants.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, however, there was no bonfire for only the second
time since 1909.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, there's a lot of cheering, a lot of whooping,
there's so much enthusiasm,'' said Sonny Wellmeyer, whose daughter
Kristin, 19, is a sophomore. ``But this year, it's like a wake.''
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the accident remained a mystery Thursday. Ray
Bowen, the university president, has said he will appoint a task
force to investigate the bonfire's collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Injured student Dominic Braus was released from the hospital
Thursday, while Milton ``Chip'' Thiel was released on Wednesday.
Two students remain hospitalized, with Bill Davis finishing
physical therapy at St. Joseph's Regional Health Center and John
Comstock listed in critical condition at College Station Medical
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' mother, Cheryl Davis, who spent Thanksgiving at her son's
side, said he's ``doing great. We're very, very thankful,'' she
added.
</P>
<P>
   In past years, getting to the bonfire site has been its own
excitement, with drivers honking and people waving at nearly every
car on the road, said James Adams, a 20-year-old junior.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then, when you come across the highway, you can see the
bonfire sticking up, silhouetted against the sky. You throw your
stuff down, find your friends and get out here,'' Adams said.
``It's like waiting for a jet to take off.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, though, Adams handed out candles to the people
streaming to the bonfire site, and the highways lacked the sounds
of exuberance.
</P>
<P>
   A fence surrounding the site became a makeshift memorial in a
town overcome with symbols to memorialize the dead. Walking slowly
and quietly as if at a museum exhibition, families walked around
the perimeter, heads down, studying the flowers, poems and ribbons
that had festooned the fence. Behind it, the bonfire logs had been
piled up neatly into rows.
</P>
<P>
   Families at the site spoke softly, if at all. And although there
were hundreds walking around at the site in the mid-day sunshine,
the only sounds were the breeze blowing through the flower
bouquets, muffled sniffles, and birds chirping in the surrounding
trees.
</P>
<P>
   Those who came to remember the students killed and injured in
the tragedy left class rings, towels, Aggie baseball caps, flags,
and signs that read, ``We will never forget you.''
</P>
<P>
   Flags across town are at half-staff, motorists who drive past
the bonfire site have their headlights on in a symbol of
remembrance, and maroon and white ribbons, the Aggie colors, are
pinned to virtually ever chest.
</P>
<P>
   On a plywood billboard that served as a giant greeting card, Kim
Harrell, a 20-year-old Texas A&AMP;M sophomore could find just a small
space to scribble her thought in between the hundreds of messages
already there. She wrote, simply: ``Always in out hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't look around campus without seeing someone wearing a
ribbon,'' she said. ``This whole week has been very, very solemn.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a few feet away, Pam Little laid a rose at each of the
twelve crosses erected alongside the fence. The she stepped back,
looked at them, and cried in her husband's arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes us realize how much we have in common,'' said Little,
who named her 17-year old son Kyle after the football stadium.
``This time of year we always hate the University of Texas. But now
this is bringing us together. But you hate for it to be something
like this to make you stop and realize that.''
</P>
<P>
   At their Thanksgiving table, Kyle Little said they all said a
prayer and ate. This year, he said, it was much more quiet.
</P>

CHICAGO UTILITY OUSTS 5 MORE OFFICIALS AFTER SUMMER'S POWER
FAILURES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Trying to restore confidence after a series of
high-profile power failures here last summer, Commonwealth Edison
asked for the resignations of five more executives and middle
managers this week.
</P>
<P>
   The company said Thursday that the resignations were part of a
continuing restructuring effort that is trying to address many of
the reliability problems at the giant utility, which was sharply
criticized last summer by Mayor Richard M. Daley, who accused
Commonwealth Edison of neglecting its equipment and repairs.
</P>
<P>
   The problems in Chicago were among the most embarrassing in a
summer that saw several of the nation's largest utilities struggle
with soaring energy demands, the new challenges brought about by
deregulation, and outdated and faulty equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Last July, more than 100,000 customers were without power for up
to three days during a heat wave here. And on one day in August
about 2,300 businesses in downtown Chicago lost power for up to 11
hours, a situation that closed even the Chicago Board of Trade.
</P>
<P>
   Commonwealth Edison, which serves 3.4 million customers in
northern Illinois, made repeated apologies to the mayor and the
city, but the power failures revealed some deep-seated problems at
some of the nation's oldest and biggest utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Commonwealth Edison chief executive John Rowe has
vowed to put better managers in place at the utility and to
overhaul its transmission and distribution system.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after the power failures, two high-level executives
with more than 20 years of experience in the division were
dismissed. And just two months ago, the utility released an
850-page report to the city of Chicago that detailed the causes of
the summer power failures, which in large part had to do with
faulty equipment and poor repair records.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday the company said that another vice president and four
middle managers were asked to resign last Monday after a review by
Carl Croskey, the newly appointed president of the transmission and
distribution unit. The executive and four managers _ who had titles
like substation manager and transmission and distribution planning
manager _ agreed to resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of the reorganization,'' said Steven Solomon, a
spokesman for Commonwealth Edison. ``It's difficult to say this was
related only to the summer outages, but we were looking at this
area and we decided these people didn't fit in.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   No other executives are expected to lose their jobs, Solomon
said.
</P>
<P>
   The changes come as the Unicom Corporation, which is based in
Chicago and is the parent of Commonwealth Edison, is seeking
regulatory approval for a proposed $16 billion merger with Peco
Energy Co. in Philadelphia as part of a plan to create a more
national utility that could someday sell and distribute power
across a larger region.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in October, Rowe said the summer power failures
were among the most embarrassing events of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was miserable because we made ourselves a standard of
incompetence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rowe said other big utilities faced many of the problems that
Commonwealth Edison faced: the companies must determine how much to
spend and must prepare for worst-case scenarios and events like
heat waves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all a matter of how far you go out on the probability
curve,'' Rowe said. ``Our review shows we weren't far enough out.
But everything costs money.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the power failures, however, the utility has faced
litigation and threats from the city of Chicago, which could go
elsewhere to meet its energy needs.
</P>
<P>
   Though energy experts say the problems in Chicago appear more
severe than those in the rest of the nation, they have said that
the nation's utilities face major changes because of new power
demands and new rules that allow utilities to sell and distribute
power across regions.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Rowe said the challenges facing electric
utilities were unique.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than any other industry, utilities deal in long-term
consequences,'' he said. ``You can't come into a utility with $10
billion in nuclear plants and decide overnight you'll go solar.''

`BACK HOME CAFE' GIVES PEOPLE A 2ND CHANCE AT LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SARA RIMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Gary Ackerman was making sandwiches at the Back
Home Cafe with his usual devotion. He neatly stacked thick slices
of fresh roast beef, ham and turkey between rolls lined with
lettuce, and spooned up mounds of tuna salad made with broccoli and
toasted almonds.
</P>
<P>
   But just as he pulled out the Saran wrap, Ackerman, 49, a
slightly built man with graying hair and dimples, stopped. ``I
forgot the cheese,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He has to constantly remind himself about the cheese in the ham
and cheese, he said, explaining, ``I hate cheese.'' While
Ackerman's aversion to cheese can sometimes be a problem on the
job, his illness, schizophrenia, which he controls with medication,
is not.
</P>
<P>
   The Back Home Cafe anchors Gary Ackerman.
</P>
<P>
   He works alongside people who understand his struggles: Tracy
Young, another sandwich maker, is also schizophrenic. Marge Kramer,
at the cash register, fights against paralyzing depression. Lanier
Evans, who makes deliveries, recently marked his one-year
anniversary without drugs. Dennis Griffin, the cook, has been
homeless, and is a recovering alcoholic. Annette Mills, also a
cook, is a 40-year-old mother of six, who has just gotten off
public assistance, thanks to her job at the Back Home Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I wasn't working, I started isolating, staying up in my
room,'' Ackerman said during a break.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a tendency to go back in time: `If only I'd done this
differently, if I'd known about my mental illness sooner.' When I'm
working, all the bad feelings go out the window. I feel like I'm a
part of society.''
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman has been at the Back Home Cafe since it was started,
three years ago, by a Catholic nun, Sister Mary Scullion, and Joan
Dawson-McConnon, who have been helping people who are homeless,
mentally ill and overcoming addictions to build meaningful lives
for two decades. The restaurant, at 1515 Fairmount Ave., north of
City Hall, is inside an Art Deco building where Sister Scullion and
Ms. Dawson-McConnon have built 48 apartments for the homeless, and
which also contains the office for their organization, Project
Home.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning before Thanksgiving, the Back Home Cafe was
humming. Griffin, 42, who knows what it is to be hungry, was
dishing up enormous servings of eggs, grits and omelets. The prices
are a bargain: $1.99 for two eggs with home fried potatoes or
grits, toast and coffee; $1.79 for a three-egg cheese omelet with
toast. If the Back Home Cafe were more interested in profits _ it
barely breaks even _ Griffin's portions would be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis' servings are ridiculous,'' said Lynn Giordano, the
former cafe manager, who now does job training at Project Home and
had stopped in for coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Giordano poured a cup of tea for Georgianna Simmons. Ms.
Simmons, 61, lost her toes to frostbite during a brutal winter on
the streets, and has trouble keeping her balance. She recently
broke her shoulder, and is on a sabbatical as a vegetable chopper
at the cafe.
</P>
<P>
   Sabbaticals are freely given at the restaurant, with Mrs. Kramer
watching out for those who need time off. ``Marge will notice if
someone is off their medication,'' Ms. Giordano said. ``Every once
in awhile, someone will flip out.''
</P>
<P>
   The new cafe manager, Michael O'Halloran, took over in
September, giving up his job as a sous chef at a fashionable
downtown restaurant called Fork. The community atmosphere at the
cafe appealed to him.
</P>
<P>
   Both the atmosphere and the food have been praised by Rick
Nichols, the food essayist at The Philadelphia Inquirer.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman said he was nervous about the new manager at first.
``The hardest part was when Lynn left, and Mike came in,'' he said.
``Was he going to let me go? Is he going to change this or that? I
don't like change.''
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman was making sandwiches alongside Tracy Young, 32, who is
his best friend. Both men live in Project Home efficiency
apartments downtown, with their restaurant wages helping to pay the
rent.
</P>
<P>
   As everyone at the cafe knows, Young spends most of his money in
Chinatown, buying porcelain dishes and furniture. He has a passion
for everything Chinese and Egyptian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be in the restaurant business for the rest of
my life,'' he said. ``I really would like to lecture on Chinese and
Egyptian history.'' He tries to sneak Cantonese opera compact disks
onto the cafe CD player, but his co-workers can't take the music
for long.
</P>
<P>
   Young said he knows what the public thinks of the mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're portrayed in the movies as trying to stab people, and
cut off people's heads,'' he said. ``People don't understand mental
illness. They put all those negative stories about mentally ill
people in the newspapers. They don't put in the paper that people
are getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I try really hard to present myself as normal as possible so
people won't be afraid of me,'' Young said. With health care,
counseling and decent housing, the 24 people who work at the Back
Home Cafe are all getting better. Ackerman says he no longer hears
voices telling him to kill himself. Now, he said, he wants to help
others. ``I want to make people happy,'' he said. `There's no use
moping.''

MORE MARQUEE MOUNTS SOMEHOW PASS BY PINCAY
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Laffit Pincay continues his record pursuit
this weekend while Hollywood Park holds its annual Turf Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Sad to say, one attraction has very little to do with the other.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay, 11 wins from Bill Shoemaker's career-record 8,833, is
scheduled to ride in only one of the six stakes that make up the
Turf Festival today, Saturday and Sunday. And Pincay's lone mount,
Reba's Gold in Saturday's Generous Stakes, is not considered a
contender in that $200,000 race for 2-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   The scarcity of strong mounts in the richest races is an old
story for Pincay, who missed the Triple Crown and the Breeders' Cup
this year and hasn't ridden a Grade I stakes winner since Tactical
Cat in the 1998 Hollywood Futurity.
</P>
<P>
   But these days it's especially poignant, because Pincay should
be center-stage as his big moment approaches, and puzzling, because
he's riding as well as anybody on the circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay is too classy to complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't frustrate me. I understand,'' Pincay said Wednesday
in the Hollywood Park jockeys' room. ``There are a lot of good
riders here. Most of the stables have their own riders that they
ride.''
</P>
<P>
   He realizes he loses a few would-be mounts because he can't work
with horses during morning training as often as some jockeys do.
His 850-calories-a-day diet and personal fitness routine requires
him to conserve energy for the afternoons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I quit going in the mornings because I had to, not because I
wanted to. As hard as I was dieting, I just couldn't do it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Pincay, who will turn 53 on Dec. 29, thinks his age has
become an issue in the past few years for some of the trainers and
owners who pass him over for younger jockeys.
</P>
<P>
   He admits to feeling ``a little satisfaction'' when he has been
replaced following a horse's poor performance, and the horse runs
badly under the new rider, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``You say, `I wonder who they're blaming now,''' Pincay said
with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   After finishing third in the Oak Tree jockey standings, Pincay
(with nine wins) was second to Pat Valenzuela (10) at Hollywood
Park going into the Thanksgiving Day races, where he won twice.
Pincay's 22.5 winning percentage was the best at the 11-days-old
meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to feel that I'm not just hanging on to break
the record,'' Pincay said.
</P>
<P>
   So why does Pincay _ winner of a Kentucky Derby (Swale, 1984),
three Belmont Stakes, seven Breeders' Cup races, seven Hollywood
Gold Cups and 13 million-dollar races _ have (as of mid-week) only
one mount in the $2.1 million Turf Festival?
</P>
<P>
   Was it so long ago that he was a fixture in the Turf Festival
races, winning the Citation Handicap three times, including both
divisions in 1991 with Notorious Pleasure and Fly Till Dawn;
winning the Matriarch twice, most recently in 1994 aboard Exchange;
and the Hollywood Derby and Hollywood Turf Express once each?
</P>
<P>
   Why do younger riders who have accomplished none of the above
even once have two or three mounts? Hall of Famer Chris McCarron
and Corey Nakatani will be busiest with five each.
</P>
<P>
   Agent Bob Meldahl said he can't understand why Pincay doesn't
get stakes mounts anymore. The fact Pincay is climbing an exercise
machine instead of exercising horses most mornings doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's a stakes horse and someone wants him to work him, he's
here,'' Meldahl said.
</P>
<P>
   But Meldahl can do the math. A lot of good riders scramble for
mounts at Hollywood Park, Santa Anita and Del Mar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like New York, where they have four top riders,''
Meldahl said. ``Here we have 10 _ for six-horse races.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, because Pincay rides at 117 pounds, heavier than most
local jockeys, he loses some stakes horses who are assigned lower
weights. Reba's Gold is supposed to carry 114 in the 1-mile
Generous. Trainer Dan Hendricks said he isn't bothered by the three
pounds of overweight.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had five more (Turf Festival horses), I'd give them to
him (Pincay),'' Hendricks said.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay would have ridden Daytime for trainer Kathy Walsh in the
$500,000 Hollywood Derby, but that horse won't make the 14-horse
field. So Pincay will go to Turf Paradise in Phoenix on Sunday to
ride Kits Peak for trainer Walter Greenman in a $75,000 race called
the Queen of the Green Handicap.
</P>
<P>

APPEALS BY PASSING ARIZO NA'S HIGH COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JON KAMMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A ``plain error of fact'' in decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court
and U.S. Court of Appeals has thrown the criminal-appeals process
into chaos in Arizona and must be corrected quickly, the state
Attorney General's Office contends.
</P>
<P>
   A ruling this month by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S.
Circuit's federal appellate court allows appeals in most criminal
cases to bypass Arizona's highest court altogether, but in effect
also permits them to be filed simultaneously in state and federal
court, doubling the workload.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ensuing dramatic drain on federal judicial resources is
easy to foresee,'' says a petition for a rehearing filed by state
Attorney General Janet Napolitano's office.
</P>
<P>
   The petition seeks to undo the ruling through a rarely granted
review by a majority of the 21 appellate judges of the 9th U.S.
Circuit, based in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   At worst, prosecutors for the state say, the new ``bypass the
Arizona Supreme Court rule'' set forth Nov. 2 could open the door
to thousands of new appeals in cases dating back as far as 10 years
to an Arizona decision that prosecutors say the federal courts have
misinterpreted.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a completely ungrounded basis, they've come up with this
devastating opinion,'' the author of the petition, Assistant
Attorney General Eric J. Olsson of the Tucson office, said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, the court ruling raises ``serious questions
as to whether future federal habeas proceedings in the District of
Arizona can be conducted in any orderly manner,'' the petition
says.
</P>
<P>
   A writ of habeas corpus is a federal court's order for
authorities to justify holding someone prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, after a state prisoner's direct appeal has made its
way through a mandatory review by the state Court of Appeals, it
can be forwarded for review by the state's top court. The state
Supreme Court has the option of reviewing it or not; but in the
past, none of the claims could be carried to the next higher level,
U.S. District Court, without giving the state court a chance to
consider them first.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the bulk of more than 500 such petitions filed annually
could go straight to federal court or to both places, resulting in
duplicated effort, confusion over what happens if rulings differ in
each court, and removal of the state's highest court from deciding
a number of appeals issues.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred prisoners a year already seek habeas corpus
writs in U.S. District Court, but the number of complaints in their
petitions is greatly reduced from their initial filings.
</P>
<P>
   Many times, inmates file their appeals without an attorney,
submitting briefs of varying degrees of sophistication in longhand
and often presenting long lists of complaints about trial errors,
infringement of rights and misconduct by authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Sequential handling of appeals through what amounts to a chain
of judicial command is important for efficiency, prosecutors say,
because the number of claims is winnowed at each stage.
</P>
<P>
   It was a petition filed on his own in 1994 by Samuel W. Swoopes,
an inmate at the state prison in Florence, that led to this month's
decision by the 9th U.S. Circuit panel.
</P>
<P>
   Swoopes has filed numerous appeals since being convicted in
Tucson in 1986 and sentenced to 42 years' imprisonment for armed
robbery, kidnapping and sexual assault. His latest appeal, which
under complex rules should be his last, reached the U.S. Supreme
Court after his claim was rejected by the 9th U.S. Circuit
appellate court.
</P>
<P>
   After the nation's highest court ruled in June in a similar case
from Illinois, it instructed the appellate court to take a fresh
look at the Swoopes petition.
</P>
<P>
   To the astonishment of prosecutors, the 9th U.S. Circuit panel's
decision has exactly the opposite effect of what the highest court
five months earlier had set forth as a rule: If a state court has
the option, but not necessarily the obligation, to review an
appeal, a prisoner must give it a chance to do so before moving on
to the federal level.
</P>
<P>
   Swoopes alleges that his right to due process was violated by
the unusual way in which he was identified as one of three men who
broke into a home, robbed three occupants at gunpoint and raped a
woman. (See accompanying story.)
</P>
<P>
   A federal public defender in Tucson, Javier Chon-Lopez, was
appointed to represent Swoopes in his appeal when the issue reached
the 9th U.S. Circuit level.
</P>
<P>
   Chon-Lopez declined to comment on specifics of the case. He said
he is not allowed to submit an answer to the prosecutors' request
for a rehearing unless invited to do so by the appellate bench.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, appellate court spokesman Mark Mendenhall said
that of more than 700 requests submitted annually for rehearings en
banc _ by a majority of the court _ only 12 to 20 are granted. Most
involve civil, rather than criminal cases, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new ``bypass the state Supreme Court'' ruling affects only
Arizona. The Swoopes opinion says it applies to appeals of all
criminal cases except those involving the death penalty or life
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   The central mistake in the ruling is ``an arcane fiction'' that
grew mainly from federal court misreadings of a 1989 state
decision, according to the petition crafted by Olsson and Paul J.
McMurdie, the Phoenix-based chief of criminal appeals for the
Attorney General's Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a comedy of errors that just isn't funny at all,'' Olsson
said in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   Both the U.S. Supreme Court and the 9th U.S. Circuit panel
interpreted the decade-old case to mean that Arizona's Supreme
Court doesn't normally handle appeals and doesn't care if the cases
go directly to U.S. District Court, Olsson explained.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not true, either as a matter of policy or in actual
practice, he said. The three-judge panel was provided statistics
disproving it before the members ruled, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Swoopes panel's decision plays havoc with the long-standing
principle that state courts have the first opportunity to rule on
questions of federal constitutional law raised by state prisoners,
the petition says.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's petition denounces the Swoopes decision
as ``fraught with errors of fact and law'' and a ``gross
misperception'' of the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in the
``O'Sullivan vs. Boerckel'' case from Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   The petition is worded less sharply in maintaining that the
nation's highest court misportrayed the willingness of Arizona's
Supreme Court to review appeals.
</P>
<P>
   The highest court may have relied on lower federal courts'
erroneous interpretations of earlier cases ``without questioning
their accuracy or making any independent inquiry into Arizona
law,'' the prosecutors' petition suggests.
</P>
<P>
   The three-judge panel in Swoopes strayed into the language of an
independent O'Sullivan opinion by Justice David Souter that,
although concurring with the result, differed from O'Connor's
majority opinion, Olsson wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really an enigma to me'' how the appellate panel could
use the O'Sullivan ruling as the basis for a completely opposite
conclusion five months later in the Arizona case, Olsson said.

AFTER A MURDER TRIAL, AMARILLO ASKS, `IS THIS A TOLERANT PLACE?'  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMARILLO, Texas _ While there are all sorts of teen-age cliques
in this Texas Panhandle city, it is the punks and the preps who
have always collided. None of the insults ever escalated beyond
fistfights, though, until one of the punks, Brian Deneke, was run
over in a street brawl, killed by a prep in a Cadillac.
</P>
<P>
   In the two years since, the case has stirred the city,
particularly with the verdict in September: Charged with murder,
Dustin Camp, the 17-year-old in the Cadillac, was instead convicted
of manslaughter and sentenced to nothing more than probation. He
walked out of the courthouse while Deneke's friends wept at an
outcome that has only intensified their belief that in the
conservative culture of Amarillo, some lives do not count as much
as others.
</P>
<P>
   To Camp's supporters, the outcome was just: he had no criminal
record and acted, his lawyer argued, only to aid a friend whose
life appeared endangered.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, the events surrounding the killing have
prompted unexpected soul searching in Amarillo. Not only have those
events become a galvanizing symbol to the largely blue-collar
punks, who see themselves as marginalized and outcast, but they
have also caused much of the town to ask a painful question: Are we
a tolerant place, as accepting of young people like the punks as we
are of the clean-cut, mostly affluent preps, some of whom come from
Amarillo's most elite families?
</P>
<P>
   ``It will probably be a memory of a lifetime for a great many
people,'' Rebecca King, the local district attorney, said of the
case. ``It made us turn in and look at ourselves and see if we can
do things better.''
</P>
<P>
   The very land of Amarillo seems to inspire conformity, with
uninterrupted flat prairie of cattle ranches and cotton farms
outside the city. There is a local eccentric, Stanley Marsh III, a
millionaire whose famous piece of Americana, the Cadillac Ranch and
its row of 10 Caddys buried halfway in the ground, attracts a
smattering of tourists. But the individualism chosen by Brian
Deneke, just an obscure teen-ager who dropped out of high school
and wore his hair in a spiked mohawk, carried a price.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always getting jumped and harassed,'' said his father,
Mike Deneke. ``We would tell him if he was going to dress that way
and live that lifestyle, it would happen. He would tell us that
people shouldn't be judged that way.''
</P>
<P>
   At the trial, Camp's lawyer, Warren Clark, aggressively trained
a focus on Brian Deneke and his friends, characterizing them as
violent thugs. The brawl occurred on Dec. 12, 1997, provoked by a
confrontation a week earlier between Camp and some friends of
Deneke's. Testimony as to what happened was often conflicting, but
there was agreement that both sides gathered outside an all-night
pancake house before moving across the street to fight. Clark
portrayed the punks as the aggressors and established that at least
one carried a bat, another a chain.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the fighting erupted, Camp drove away from the scene
with two friends in his late-model Cadillac. But he quickly doubled
back and plowed his car over Deneke. Camp returned, Clark argued,
because he had seen Deneke beating one of his friends with a chain
(a contention denied by Deneke's friends).
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors argued that Camp acted not in defense of his friend
but in a drunken fury. One of his friends in the car, Elise
Thompson, class valedictorian, testified for the prosecution that
Camp's car jumped a median and rammed Deneke and that Camp yelled
moments later: ``I'm a Ninja in my Caddy! I bet he liked that
one!''
</P>
<P>
   Although the jurors decided on manslaughter rather than murder,
it was their sentence that truly astonished many here. During the
trial's sentencing phase, Camp took the stand and apologized to the
Deneke family and to his own. The courtroom was divided into two
warring camps _ the punks seated behind the prosecution, the
football players and the preps seated behind the defense _ as the
jury handed up no long prison term but instead 10 years' probation.
</P>
<P>
   The court of public opinion reacted swiftly and, in the minds of
some, surprisingly. Letters of outrage poured into the local
newspaper. A television station's poll found that a majority of
residents thought Camp should have gone to prison. Fearing
reprisals, the judge sealed the names of the jurors, none of whom
have spoken out on their own. Callers to the city's top talk radio
program debated whether Amarillo was a tolerant place.
</P>
<P>
   Deneke's friends have created the Brian Deneke Memorial
Committee, printing T-shirts and sponsoring two concerts and a
candlelight vigil in his memory. Other groups that consider
themselves on Amarillo's margins, like gays and African-Americans,
have joined the cause.
</P>
<P>
   Kel Seliger, Amarillo's four-term mayor, said the case had
prompted him to speak out more forcefully on behalf of respect for
differences among people. But it would be wrong, he said, to
condemn Amarillo because of the verdict. ``It was not a community
verdict,'' he said. ``It was 12 people.''
</P>
<P>
   In their small house on the edge of Amarillo's affluent Wolflin
neighborhood, Mike and Debbie Camp quietly attributed the public
outrage to what they described as distorted local media coverage.
Unlike the upper-income parents of many of their son's friends, the
Camps, owners of a local garage, are middle class. They dispute any
suggestion that the case involves rich versus poor, establishment
versus outcast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was about Dustin seeing his friends getting killed and
doing something about it,'' Debbie Camp said. ``He was very brave
and courageous, and we're supportive of him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Camps say they have received 1,000 letters of support.
Dustin, now 18, works at his family's garage, and he plans to go to
college this winter. The Camps say that ``Dustin and his friends
are the kind of people you would want your son to be or your
daughter to be.'' Mrs. Camp sees youths like Brian Deneke as ``lost
children of God.''
</P>
<P>
   In their small house in a lower-income neighborhood, Mike and
Betty Deneke quietly grieve for their son. They did not recognize
as Brian the violent aggressor whom the defense lawyer described at
the trial. They remember a nice, smiling youth _ far from perfect
but not bad, even if he looked different. Mike Deneke recalled that
he initially resisted as his son began to change his appearance.
Once, he said, he even tried to cut Brian's hair.
</P>
<P>
   But then he changed his mind, particularly as he met the
teen-agers with spiked hair and pierced noses who came into their
house with Brian. ``Some of them were kicked out and couldn't go
home,'' he said. ``Some of them didn't want to go home. We didn't
want that to happen to Brian. We thought he was a good kid. We
decided to let him be who he was and realize the goodness about
himself and not drive him away.''
</P>
<P>
   The Denekes have retained a lawyer, who says he will soon file a
wrongful-death suit against the Camps. The lawyer, Jeff Blackburn,
says the Denekes do not expect to reap much money but do hope to
get justice, at least of the sort that can be found in a
courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``God,'' Mrs. Deneke said, ``is the judge in the end.''

<P>
   BEIJING _ At least 119 people are dead and more than 150 missing
after a ferry in stormy seas burned and broke apart off China's
northeastern coast, official news media reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday night, according to differing accounts from the
shipping company and the New China News Agency, either 22 or 36
survivors had been found from the ship, which that had been
carrying 312 passengers and crew members.
</P>
<P>
   As the night wore on, and with the temperature near freezing,
officials said they had little hope of finding more survivors.
Sixteen-foot waves and the frigid weather hampered the rescue
effort near the port city of Yantai, in Shandong province. A
helicopter, dozens of ships and thousands of soldiers and residents
along the shoreline joined in the search for survivors from the
wreck, which occurred about one-and-a-half miles offshore, the news
agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The ship, the 126-meter-long Dashun, belonged to Yanda Ferry Co.
in Shandong. It left Yantai on Wednesday afternoon for what is
normally a seven-to-eight-hour journey 100 miles north to the city
of Dalian.
</P>
<P>
   It was forced to turn back because of the extreme conditions,
but then around 4:30 p.m. Wednesday, flames were discovered on the
second deck, and the ship sent out a distress signal, the news
agency said. The wind, waves and heavy snow prevented other ships
from immediately approaching.
</P>
<P>
   Some four hours later, apparently engulfed by fire, the ship
began drifting. It was not clear from the contradictory accounts
whether the ship eventually sank or ran aground. Officials said the
cause of the fire was under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   One survivor, a 28-year-old man, told the French news agency
Agence France-Presse that around 4 p.m. Wednesday, all the
passengers rushed to the upper deck because of heavy smoke from
below, where some 60 cars were making the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided to jump into the water because the smoke was so
strong it was hard to breathe,'' he said, adding that he and five
other men had jumped at once. He lost track of the others and swam
for an hour, he said, before reaching the shore.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials said many bodies had washed ashore, along with a
few people who were found unconscious but still alive.
</P>
<P>
   According to local news media, this was the second accident in
five weeks for a vessel operated by Yanda Ferry Co. In October, a
ship caught fire and sank near Dalian, but all but three people
were rescued.
</P>
<P>
   State television Thursday night showed pictures of a beach
littered with fruits and other debris from the ship.

SPENDING LIKE IT'S THE LAST HOLIDAY OF CENTURY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KERRY FEHR-SNYDER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you believe the song by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince,
you're going to party like it's 1999.
</P>
<P>
   And if you buy the latest survey by American Express, you'll
spend $1,558, on average, doing it.
</P>
<P>
   The annual holiday crunch has arrived, but this year stands out
for the high hopes and even higher expectations placed on
celebrating the season.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, retailers are betting on strong consumer spending
starting November 26 from those who believe this is the last chance
to make Christmas, Hanukkah, Ramadan, Kwanzaa and New Year's Eve
the best of the century.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely a different energy that wasn't there before
because of the millennium and the idea that we're heading into a
new century,'' Brooke LeBaron of Macy's department store said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there's a social aspect to it, where people are doing
things a little bigger and a little more elaborate.''
</P>
<P>
   Macy's is making the most of the millennium mania with a new
radio ad that began airing Monday:
</P>
<P>
   ``This holiday season is the most exciting of all,'' a female
voice gushes to her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, it's the end of the century, the end of the
millennium, the end of an era. We've got to decorate this place
like never before and give the 1900s a proper sendoff.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without capitalizing on the idea, the hype surrounding the
end of the century alone seems to be pressuring people to celebrate
the holidays in style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen it with New Year's,'' Phoenix psychiatrist Mark
Wellek said. ``It's not because it's the last one; it's because
it's such a big event that everyone wants to take part.''
</P>
<P>
   In the field of psychology, the phenomenon is known as an
``infection of affect,'' Wellek said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever there's a lot of publicity and not a lot of
controversy, you get caught up in it,'' he said. ``Most people are
infected by the feeling that it's a big event and they should do
something to mark it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Wellek feels the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, my wife and I just sit home and relax,'' he said.
``This year, we'll probably want to do a little something more.''
</P>
<P>
   The new attitude comes as consumers seem more crunched for time
than ever.
</P>
<P>
   This year's American Express holiday spending survey indicated
that one-third of consumers plan to shop from home by ordering
gifts either through mail-order catalogs or the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interestingly, they (shoppers) seem to be budgeting their time
as carefully as their money,'' American Express spokesman Tom
Sclafani said.
</P>
<P>
   Malls, where consumers can find one-stop shopping, remain the
most popular shopping destinations, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, consumers expect to spend 16 percent more this year
than last, or an average of $1,558 on everything from gifts to
decorations to holiday travel.
</P>
<P>
   Sclafani attributed the rise to a robust economy and a strong
stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Another survey said that much of that holiday spending will be
made possible with credit and debit cards. During the 29-day
holiday shopping period, U.S. consumers are expected to rack up a
record $126.5 billion on credit and debit cards, according to
CardWeb.com and RAM Research Group.
</P>
<P>
   The estimate doesn't surprise Robert McKinley, chief executive
officer of CardWeb.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more places to use plastic today than ever before,''
he said. ``All the elements of the cashless society are here.
Everything can be `plasticized.' ''
</P>
<P>
   McKinley also cited the economy and high consumer confidence for
the growing use of plastic; the survey didn't delve into
end-of-the-century attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people may want to party like it's 1999 and hope that
their (credit-card) balances will vanish in the New Year'' due to a
Y2K computer glitch, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't think consumers really know what they think.''
</P>
<P>
   McKinley cautioned that all holiday spending estimates are just
that, pointing out that another survey released this week predicted
that consumers will spend an average of $500 per household on
gifts. That survey was conducted by the Conference Board, a
non-profit organization of businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``These surveys are just guesstimates,'' he said. ``Pick a
number between the two _ say $750 _ and that's probably about
right.'' &QL;

HOUSE REPUBLICANS SEEK MORE CASH FROM BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Alarmed and embarrassed by the recent financial
success of House Democrats, top fund-raisers for House Republicans
issued an urgent appeal this week to business interests to increase
their giving to Republican candidates and committees.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican concern arises from a startling shift in
political donations from businesses to the House fund-raising
committees. After long benefiting from a huge disparity in
contributions from corporations and trade groups, Republicans saw
their advantage virtually disappear in the first six months of this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Business interests gave the National Republican Congressional
Committee $9.99 million and the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee $9.96 million through June 30, according to an analysis
by the Center for Responsive Politics, an independent research
group.
</P>
<P>
   While House Republicans still have an overall financial lead
over House Democrats, the gap has narrowed markedly as the parties
head into a highly competitive contest for control of the House
next year, prompting a shakeup at the Republican congressional
committee. The Republicans hold a precarious five-seat margin in
the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are running scared,'' said Stuart Rothenberg, publisher
of a newsletter on Congress. ``The money is an accurate gauge of
just how close this race for the House is going to be. People who
can count believe the Democrats have at least a 50-50 chance of
taking over the House.''
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, the directors of corporate campaign accounts and
political action committees are pouring money into the Democratic
congressional committee in an apparent hedge strategy, according to
federal campaign records.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T gave the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee
$12,900 in the first six months of 1997; this year the company has
already donated $102,200. Fannie Mae increased its contribution to
$100,000 this year from $25,000 in 1997; Enron, the energy concern,
gave $105,000 this year compared with $16,000 in 1997, and SBC
Communications gave $85,000 compared with $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   This pattern of giving worries House Republican leaders. Earlier
this month the National Republican Congressional Committee hired
Daniel Mattoon, a lobbyist for BellSouth Corp., as deputy chairman
to try to reverse the trend.
</P>
<P>
   This week Mattoon, a longtime ally of Speaker Dennis Hastert of
Illinois and the House Republican whip, Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas,
enlisted Bill Paxon, a former congressman from upstate New York and
chairman of the Republican congressional committee, and Haley
Barbour, a former Republican national chairman, to try to persuade
business representatives to step up their donations to Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   At a breakfast and lunch on Monday with 90 business lobbyists,
Mattoon, Paxon and Barbour sought to address complaints that House
Republicans were poorly led, spent money foolishly and were in
danger of losing their majority.
</P>
<P>
   Mattoon told the lobbyists _ representing major
telecommunications companies, banks, health-care interests, tobacco
companies and energy concerns _ that he was unhappy at the new
corporate generosity to Democrats. He assured them that Republicans
had strong candidates and a viable strategy to keep their majority
in the House.
</P>
<P>
   And he issued a strong appeal to the lobbyists to step up their
contributions and to solicit donations from others to strengthen
the Republican congressional committee's bottom line by the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   The committee was embarrassed by figures on June 30 showing that
the House Democratic campaign committee had more money in the bank,
$10.7 million, than its Republican counterpart, with $10.1 million.
The Republican committee had raised $27 million to the Democrats'
$17 million, but had spent more than twice as much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them we certainly would appreciate any help they could
give and their friends could give before we close the books on Dec.
31,'' Mattoon said in an interview. ``It's helpful to have all
those people together in one room and, frankly, you don't let them
go untouched.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Paxon told the lobbyists that Republicans should be proud of
their record in the current Congress, although very little
legislation was passed except for a major revision of bank
regulation pushed by Wall Street. The Republican sales pitch,
curiously, revolves around the virtues of inaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most Americans, Congress not doing a lot is not a bad
thing,'' Paxon said. ``It's a lot better not to make big
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those who attended the breakfast session on Monday was Tim
McKone, vice president for congressional relations at SBC, the
regional telephone giant. McKone said that although he considered
himself a loyal Republican, his company so far this year had split
its contributions between Democrats and Republicans because ``we
have friends on both sides of the aisle.''
</P>
<P>
   The company virtually matched its $85,000 gift to the Democratic
congressional committee with $87,000 in contributions to the
Republican committee, according to federal records. Overall this
year, SBC has given Democratic Party committees $211,000 in
unregulated donations, or soft money, while giving the Republicans
$216,000.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997-98, SBC gave Republican Party committees $293,000,
almost twice what it gave to the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are delighted with the Republicans' discomfort. The
House minority leader, Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, is leading
an aggressive drive to regain the House majority and using the
prospect of the Democrats' retaking the House as a fund-raising
tool.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Equale, an insurance lobbyist close to Gephardt, said,
``The Democrats remember what it's like to be in the majority and
want to be in the majority again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are clearly letting it be known that the train is leaving
the station and they want everyone on board,'' Equale said. ``It
makes for some very interesting financial politics.''

 UNDATED: satellite customers. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Echostar's chairman and chief executive, Charlie Ergen, said
earlier this month that the final bill ``limits consumer channel
choices and takes more money out of the consumer's pockets.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is no question that the legislation unlocks true
competition between the satellite and cable industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a perfect bill, `` said Marsocci of DirecTV. ``We
are not happy with every provision, but on balance we do support
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The rates for satellite television are very competitive with
those of most cable services, ranging from under $10 a month for a
basic package to upwards of $100 for access to extensive packages
that include hundreds of channels of digital quality entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The price of satellite dishes required for reception have
dropped as low as $100, and are often accompanied by special deals
on service to help offset the initial purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   Marsocci said his company's new marketing campaign was already
in place, targeting the top 25 television markets just in time for
the holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been gearing up for this and preparing for quite some
time,'' he said. ``We'll be placing primarily print advertisements,
full-page print ads in the daily newspapers in each of the
markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Judi Anne Atencio, director of communications for EchoStar, said
similar plans were in the works at that company's Littleton, Colo.,
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's like yellow tape around the marketing department right
now,'' she said. ``That is a dangerous place to be. The president
is expected to sign the bill around noon on Monday, and about five
minutes later we'll be selling.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Egan, a cable and satellite analyst with Paine Webber in
New York, said consumers would quickly see the effects of the
legislation in the rollout of new services over the next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is going to happen is every few months month there is
going to be a new development,'' he said. ``I think what will
happen is they will try to compete less on price and try to compete
more on services.''
</P>
<P>
   Egan said he expected cable companies to focus their energy on
high-speed Internet and new digital services, while satellite
companies will be focusing on increased programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the beginning. It is going to get very exciting
in the year 2000.''

SPENDING LIKE IT'S THE LAST HOLIDAY OF CENTURY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   If you believe the song by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince,
you're going to party like it's 1999.
</P>
<P>
   And if you buy the latest survey by American Express, you'll
spend $1,558, on average, doing it.
</P>
<P>
   The annual holiday crunch has arrived, but this year stands out
for the high hopes and even higher expectations placed on
celebrating the season.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, retailers are betting on strong consumer spending
starting November 26 from those who believe this is the last chance
to make Christmas, Hanukkah, Ramadan, Kwanzaa and New Year's Eve
the best of the century.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely a different energy that wasn't there before
because of the millennium and the idea that we're heading into a
new century,'' Brooke LeBaron of Macy's department store said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there's a social aspect to it, where people are doing
things a little bigger and a little more elaborate.''
</P>
<P>
   Macy's is making the most of the millennium mania with a new
radio ad that began airing Monday:
</P>
<P>
   ``This holiday season is the most exciting of all,'' a female
voice gushes to her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, it's the end of the century, the end of the
millennium, the end of an era. We've got to decorate this place
like never before and give the 1900s a proper sendoff.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without capitalizing on the idea, the hype surrounding the
end of the century alone seems to be pressuring people to celebrate
the holidays in style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen it with New Year's,'' Phoenix psychiatrist Mark
Wellek said. ``It's not because it's the last one; it's because
it's such a big event that everyone wants to take part.''
</P>
<P>
   In the field of psychology, the phenomenon is known as an
``infection of affect,'' Wellek said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever there's a lot of publicity and not a lot of
controversy, you get caught up in it,'' he said. ``Most people are
infected by the feeling that it's a big event and they should do
something to mark it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Wellek feels the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, my wife and I just sit home and relax,'' he said.
``This year, we'll probably want to do a little something more.''
</P>
<P>
   The new attitude comes as consumers seem more crunched for time
than ever.
</P>
<P>
   This year's American Express holiday spending survey indicated
that one-third of consumers plan to shop from home by ordering
gifts either through mail-order catalogs or the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interestingly, they (shoppers) seem to be budgeting their time
as carefully as their money,'' American Express spokesman Tom
Sclafani said.
</P>
<P>
   Malls, where consumers can find one-stop shopping, remain the
most popular shopping destinations, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, consumers expect to spend 16 percent more this year
than last, or an average of $1,558 on everything from gifts to
decorations to holiday travel.
</P>
<P>
   Sclafani attributed the rise to a robust economy and a strong
stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Another survey said that much of that holiday spending will be
made possible with credit and debit cards. During the 29-day
holiday shopping period, U.S. consumers are expected to rack up a
record $126.5 billion on credit and debit cards, according to
CardWeb.com and RAM Research Group.
</P>
<P>
   The estimate doesn't surprise Robert McKinley, chief executive
officer of CardWeb.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more places to use plastic today than ever before,''
he said. ``All the elements of the cashless society are here.
Everything can be `plasticized.' ''
</P>
<P>
   McKinley also cited the economy and high consumer confidence for
the growing use of plastic; the survey didn't delve into
end-of-the-century attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people may want to party like it's 1999 and hope that
their (credit-card) balances will vanish in the New Year'' due to a
Y2K computer glitch, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't think consumers really know what they think.''
</P>
<P>
   McKinley cautioned that all holiday spending estimates are just
that, pointing out that another survey released this week predicted
that consumers will spend an average of $500 per household on
gifts. That survey was conducted by the Conference Board, a
non-profit organization of businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``These surveys are just guesstimates,'' he said. ``Pick a
number between the two _ say $750 _ and that's probably about
right.'' &QL;

BRITISH MBA COURSES SHAKE UP OLD SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALAN COWELL  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, England _ Li Lingping from Beijing and Cory Elysa
Cohen from New York could hardly represent more disparate
societies. Where Ms. Li, 31, lists ballroom dancing and discussion
groups as leisure time activities, Ms. Cohen, 24, prefers
kick-boxing and sports cars.
</P>
<P>
   But they agree on some of life's basics: both have career
ambitions; both sense that men tend to see them in categories
defined by gender; and both are investing time (12 months) and
money ($30,000) to acquire three letters after their names _ MBA _
which, they hope, will help propel them through the glass ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   What they share most obviously, though, is the place they have
picked to pursue their Master of Business and Administration
degrees: both chose to take a one-year MBA course in Britain. The
remarkable proliferation of business education in this country has
unleashed cut-throat competition among a growing number of schools
for talent, rankings, big-name gurus and _ the bottom line _ money.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1985, the number of institutions offering MBA courses has
increased from 26 to 116, according to Britain's Association of
MBAs.
</P>
<P>
   Over the same period, the number of graduates has almost
quadrupled, from 2,260 in 1985 to 8,752 in 1998. And, according to
the Association of Business Schools, the business of running
business and management schools has blossomed from modest
beginnings in the 1960s to an industry worth $2.5 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion has jolted some of Britain's most august places of
learning into recognizing that the days when academia might offer
management education no more than a haughty sniff are over. During
the past few years, both Oxford and Cambridge universities have
embraced business or management schools that are openly competing
for students, faculty and acclaim with such established
institutions as the London Business School, which in one recent
survey ranked as Europe's premier business school.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when Tony Blair's New Labor government says it is
seeking to transform Britain from its onetime image as a nation of
shopkeepers into a nation of aggressive, risk-taking entrepreneurs,
business education and management training appear to be set for a
further boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very lucrative area,'' said Des Dearlove, co-author of
``Gravy Training,'' a recently published study of business schools.
``More and more companies are going to put more and more managers
through some form of training.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the spread of MBA courses and others related to business
has unleashed its own sometimes venomous debate about where exactly
schools are heading and who is leading the way. Some business
teachers, for instance, argue that the proliferation of business
schools has given rise to what Nigel Piercy, a professor of
marketing at Cardiff University in Wales, termed ``the cowboy
professor'' who is ``recognized by the incessant and continuous
search for additional income,'' and ``chameleon'' academics who
flit between teaching and lucrative private consulting work.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, said London Business School dean John Quelch, , since
``the only thing you need to set up a business school is a warm
body and a piece of chalk,'' some of the myriad MBA programs are
``of dubious quality.'' And, said Anthony Hopwood, the acting
director of Oxford's Said Business School, ``there's an enormous
shortage of seriously qualified faculty and there's almost no
supply in some areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Business schools not only compete with each other, they are also
engaged in a turf fight with big management consulting firms,
particularly in the field of executive development, which for many
provides an important source of revenue. Of the London Business
School's $66 million in revenue this year, 36 percent will come
from tailored training programs for executives that are designed in
conjunction with corporations, Quelch said.
</P>
<P>
   At Cranfield School of Management, near Bedford, north of
London, roughly half of last year's $42.5 million revenue came from
executive development programs, according to Gill Marshall, the
director of corporate communications there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The line between consultancy and business education is
blurring,'' said Dearlove, the author. ``It's more and more
difficult to see where one stops and the other starts.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain's conversion to business education has come far later
than that of the United States. Business schools in this country
tend to function not simply as breeding grounds for home-grown
talent, but as a magnet for people like Ms. Li and Ms. Cohen. While
roughly three-quarters of students at American business schools are
American, some 70 percent of students at British schools graduating
from full-time MBA courses this year were foreigners seeking
overseas experience and qualifications, according to the
Association of MBAs.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Britain is not alone in Europe in seeking to advance
business education through prestigious academies such as Insead in
Paris or Bocconi University in Milan. But the pressures driving
Britain's business school explosion are different. A broader
proliferation of British university education in recent years has
taken much of the luster from a first academic degree and forced
ambitious college graduates to seek the additional cachet of a
master's degree.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Quelch, at the London Business School, also sees other forces at
work. Britain's ``shift away from the social welfare state'' has
increased pressure for managers in both the public and private
sectors to develop managerial skills. In addition, the end of the
Cold War _ and the collapse of geographical and ideological
barriers _ ``means that an entire one-third of the world's
population who had been precluded from programs outside their own
markets'' are now able to study abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, said Chong Ju Choi, the director of the MBA
program at Cambridge's Judge Institute of Management Studies, the
very fact that managers are entering an uncharted world of
e-commerce, Internet business and corporate restructuring forces
them to look for advice from consultants and business schools.
``There are very few executives who feel they are up to date,'' he
said. ``Fundamentally, it's the uncertainty. They are not sure. And
that brings them back to executive education.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the change at British business schools, one feature is
changing very slowly. Before 1970, according to the Association of
MBAs, virtually all MBA graduates in Britain were men. But even in
1997, women accounted for less than one-quarter of graduates.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason may be that business itself is
male-dominated: only one of the FTSE 100 blue chip companies,
Pearson PLC, has a female chief executive, Marjorie Scardino. And,
said Hilary Harris, a lecturer at the Cranfield management school,
research among female MBA graduates has ``shown that despite having
an MBA, if you take career progress and salaries, women fall behind
men.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason, Ms. Harris said, is that ``managing the home-work
balance is more of an issue for women than men'' _ a sentiment
echoed by some Cranfield MBA students who also argue that, since
MBA courses are usually taken in the late 20s or early 30s, they
pose a potential conflict with starting a family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The standard time for doing an MBA is often the time a woman
is thinking of starting a family,'' said Sarah Sturrock, 29, a
government official studying part time for an MBA at Cranfield in a
group of 100 that includes only 17 women. Karen Pennington, a
29-year-old engineer in the same course, said the conflict of
career and family is more acute for women. ``It's a lot more
difficult for women with children than men with children.''
</P>
<P>
   Such distinctions are not limited to Britain, of course. ``Even
when I started my career, men and women were in different
positions,'' said Ms. Li, who works as the communications director
at the Beijing subsidiary of an international corporation which she
did not wish to identify by name. ``People tended to use women for
administration, but the men went straight into the business.'' An
MBA degree, then, was not simply a key to higher salaries and more
powerful jobs. It was a way for women to receive equal treatment
with men.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a woman, it gives you even more credibility,'' said Ms.
Cohen, the New Yorker. From her own relatively brief career in
banking, she had concluded that ``it's very difficult for a woman
to be viewed as being as effective as a man. No matter what I do,
when I walk into a room, the first thing they see is not my
brains.'' The MBA degree, she said, ``is a way of being able to
balance that.''

DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR YOUNG TO STAY WITH USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After weighing his options, USC defensive
coordinator Bill Young decided it would be best to stay in his
current job instead of seeking the vacant head-coaching position at
the University of Tulsa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't feel really good about the situation,'' said
Young, who withdrew from consideration last week. ``There were a
lot of little things about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, one of the remaining Tulsa candidates is Young's
predecessor, former USC defensive coordinator Keith Burns,
currently the secondary coach at Arkansas. Others being interviewed
are Illinois State coach Todd Berry, Miami offensive coordinator
Larry Coker and Tampa Bay linebackers coach Lovie Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Young, who interviewed with the University of Hawaii last year,
said he would not apply for any other jobs and return to USC next
season.
</P>
<P>
   Curtain call: A game against Louisiana Tech doesn't evoke much
emotion from most of USC's players, but senior tailback Chad Morton
expects to get all choked up playing in his final game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll probably be real sad again,'' Morton said. ``Walking
through the tunnel before the UCLA game, with all the alumni lined
up, I was crying. It was a real scary moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Morton said that most of the Trojans still probably don't fully
appreciate the significance of snapping USC's eight-game losing
streak against UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think guys realize what they've done ending the
streak,'' he said. ``They'll think about it a lot more later in
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Look who's here: Among the NFL executives expected to appear at
today's game to scout Louisiana Tech quarterback Tim Rattay is
former UCLA coach Terry Donahue, who works for the San Francisco
49ers.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman of the year? The Pacific-10 Conference has come up with
a new award: Freshman of the Year. The leading candidate is USC
wide receiver Kareem Kelly, who has 53 receptions for 895 yards and
four touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Women's basketball game: USC's women's basketball team (1-0)
plays Creighton today at the Sports Arena at 12:30 p.m. Any fan who
has a football ticket will receive free admittance to the
basketball game.
</P>
<P>
   Easy ticket: To increase attendance, USC has invited 12,500
members of local youth groups to the game. Members of the U.S.
armed forces will also receive four free tickets if they show
military identification.
</P>
<P>
   Bad stat: According to USC research, this is the first time the
Trojans have lost all six games by 10 or fewer points. Then again,
how often have the Trojans lost six or more games?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Eight times in 111 years.
</P>
<P>
   Fox climbs: With his late-season reappearance, quarterback John
Fox has moved into 10th place on USC's career passing list, with
2,647 yards. Fox is 395 yards behind teammate Mike Van Raaphorst,
who is No. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Last chance: Wide receiver R. Jay Soward will play his last game
today, hoping to avoid a quiet finish to an otherwise flashy
four-year career.
</P>
<P>
   Soward was barely used last week against UCLA after fumbling on
his first reception. He could have had a touchdown in the third
quarter, but Fox failed to see Soward was wide open in the corner
of the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should go wring John's neck,'' Soward joked. ``But I'm just
happy we won.''

SPORTS COLUMN: MARSHALL GETS LITTLE CONSIDERATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of course it would seem unfair, unkind and rather rotten, too.
Here is Marshall University, that doughty college located in
Huntington, in the Appalachian foothills of West Virginia, whose
Thundering Herd football team is undefeated, at 10-0. It is one of
only three Division I-A teams to be unbeaten, and yet it is given
the back of the pollsters' hand, 11th in two of the most important
polls, 12th in the other.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall is shown no consideration to play in the Sugar Bowl on
Jan. 4, in which the two top-ranked college football teams (they
happen to be the other two undefeated teams, to be sure) will
decide the alleged national champion.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, one may marvel that Marshall has a football team at
all, given the trauma of 29 years ago when all 75 people aboard a
DC 9 _ 37 Marshall football players and 38 others, including
coaches, school administrators and fans _ were killed when their
airplane, returning from a game at East Carolina on a rainy
Saturday night, crashed into a mountainside on the approach to the
local Tri-State Airport. It was the worst sports team air disaster
in history.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as has been done every year on the anniversary of
that Nov. 14, 1970, fatality, a commemorative service for those who
perished was held at the Memorial Fountain, built in 1972 and
containing the names of the deceased. The Fountain is a kind of
centerpiece of the Marshall campus.
</P>
<P>
   The team in fact came back to play the season following the
crash, in 1971. It soon entered the lower I-AA division and in 1996
it won the I-AA national title, going undefeated in 15 games (Randy
Moss, the Vikings' all-pro wide receiver, was a freshman on that
team). In 1997, Marshall returned to Division I-A.
</P>
<P>
   So, while the crash of nearly three decades ago remains a sad,
but real source of perspective for the Marshall players, from the
standpoint of a purely football issue, there's another element of
inequity: there is no national playoff system in place for this
year's team. Unlike in the National Collegiate Athletic Association
basketball tournament, and even in the I-AA football 16-team
playoff series, ``there is no chance for a Cinderella team in the
I-A set-up,'' said Ricky Hazel, an official for Marshall. ``And
people love Cinderella.''
</P>
<P>
   The other two undefeated teams this season, Florida State and
Virginia Tech, are ranked No. 1 and 2 respectively in the three
major national polls, while Marshall is rated only 12th in the
USA/ESPN poll and the Associated Press poll and 13th in the New
York Times computer analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is Marshall behind those other two teams in those
polls, but it is, overall, also behind two teams with one loss and
eight teams with two losses.
</P>
<P>
   And to add insult to indignity, the Marshall footballers even
dropped a notch in the USA/ESPN and AP polls simply because they
were innocent bystanders. They didn't play a game last week and yet
fell from the 11th spot to an inconsiderate 12th (The New York
Times computer, in its infinite wisdom, moved them up one floor
from 14.)
</P>
<P>
   And more: The No. 1 team, Florida State, and Marshall have a
common opponent. It is Clemson. Each of them beat Clemson at
Clemson by three points. Virginia Tech beat Clemson, 31-11, but
Clemson coach Tommy Bowden believes Florida State is the better
team. And Marshall? ``Well, they'd be competitive against either
one of those teams,'' he said. ``Do they have the depth of talent
to win? I'm not sure. It would be fun to see, though, wouldn't
it?''
</P>
<P>
   It won't happen, however. The reason is that the Bowl
Championship Series committee chooses the top two teams based on a
rankings system that would make Fermat's Last Theorem look like a
game of dominoes. Much of the selection process has to do with the
robustness of one's schedule. While Marshall is in the Mid-America
Conference, where good football is often played, it is not the Big
Ten or the Big Eight, or the Southeast or Southwestern Conferences.
But in nonconference games, MAC schools not infrequently beat teams
from some of those swankier programs.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments against a national playoff system for I-A teams is
that it might be detrimental to the academic and physical elements
of the football players. But why is a I-AA schedule of a potential
15 games for the championship finalists less demanding than 12 or
13 games for a I-A team?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was strenuous, and there were bumps and bruises, but it was
challenging,'' said Andre O'Neal, a senior linebacker for Marshall
who was on that I-AA championship team in 1996. ``And we got
through it on the field and in the classroom.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a I-A playoff system of eight teams (Marshall would
have needed a creative, at-large bid, to make it this season) or
even 16 teams would be less taxing than the I-AA playoffs, with
fewer games overall than Marshall played in 1996. (All Marshall's
games that year, incidentally, came before Thanksgiving.)
</P>
<P>
   The current I-A schedule of 22 bowl games are all between Dec.
18 and Jan. 4. School is out for most schools between the first
week in December and the second week in January. So, no academics
and often enough time to heal sore body parts.
</P>
<P>
   Not having playoff caliber teams would not take any luster away
from such as the Humanitarian Bowl or the Micron PC Bowl or the
Motor City Bowl (where Marshall, if it beats Ohio University on
Friday for the MAC championship, will wind up, playing Pittsburgh),
because they are what they are, simply built-in excuses for
sponsors, schools and networks to make money. And some of the major
bowls, like the Fiesta, Orange, Rose and Gator, in the years they
are not playing host to the top two ranked teams, can entertain
playoff games that have resonance.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' said Lance West, Marshall's athletic director, ``would
really crown a champion.''
</P>
<P>
   But there may never be a game for Marshall like its first home
game in 1971, the season after the airplane crash. It had only
three returning players from the year before _ the three were
injured and didn't make the doomed flight _ and 20 of the 22
starters were freshmen and sophomores. Marshall was a 20-point
underdog against Xavier, and won on a last-second touchdown. It is
known by Marshall followers as ``the miracle game.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuff like that can't be accounted for in computers or polls.

LISTEN UP, HOOP FANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Coming to a website near you:
</P>
<P>
   Real-time audio of every game in the NCAA tournament. Streaming
video of press conferences. Real-time video highlights. Exclusive
postgame chat rooms with players. And stats, stats, stats and more
stats.
</P>
<P>
   And considering the pace of the Internet's growth, these could
be merely conservative predictions of what the deal between CBS and
the NCAA holds for fans.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's massive 11-year, $6 billion agreement between the
network and college association shook up the TV world, and not just
because CBS agreed to pay the NCAA more annually than it is
currently paying the NFL. The deal, which begins in 2003, also
includes Internet rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is still a New Media work in progress. But in the
last decade, it has gone from a text-based educational tool to chat
rooms to a gigantic retail and informational industry that will
only get larger. Internet-related companies are driving the latest
bull market on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   CBS holds a 20 percent stake in SportsLine Inc., the website
that has been dueling with ESPN's for sports supremacy on the net.
By adding net rights to its TV rights deal, CBS made a bold move
into the future, whatever shape it may take.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal makes sense, especially when you include Internet
rights,'' CBS Sports President Sean McManus said this week. ``No
one understands what the Internet means to TV right now. But when
it';s developed, we wanted the opportunity to take advantage of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The line between the Internet and television has become
thinner and thinner. Webcasting is growing, so the critical element
is who controls those rights. If you don't, there will be
cannibalization.''
</P>
<P>
   And no one in TV wants to get eaten. The over-the-air networks
have already lost weight in the Nielsen ratings thanks to cable and
the net stealing away viewers. The net's fantastic growth poses a
real threat to the way people get their information.
</P>
<P>
   The downloading of music already has that industry in a panic.
If the latest tunes from Bare Naked Ladies can be found and
downloaded at a web site, who's going to bother buying CDs?
</P>
<P>
   That's why CBS' pre-emptive move was so savvy. It will have
proprietary control over all NCAA video and audio, and all of the
branding, promotional and exclusivity benefits that creates.
</P>
<P>
   At least in regards to the NCAA tourney, CBS will not have to
worry about a competing net site offering the kind of bells and
whistles that could turn a potential viewer from his tube to his
computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the way people watch TV 10 years from now will
fundamentally be the same as it is today,'' said McManus. ``The way
fans view football and basketball won't be all that different. But
the Internet will be an important adjunct to what people see. It
can provide a tremendous amount of supplementary programming.''
</P>
<P>
   That would include the aforementioned audio, video, chats and
stats. But there truly is no ceiling for the Internet. Who's to say
the Internet won't be able to deliver high-definition video that
turns your keypad into a TV studio, that allows you to watch a live
game from whatever camera angle you like or call up a replay?
</P>
<P>
   Ninety percent of the population might prefer a network
telecast. But the networks can't afford losing the 10 percent
gravitating to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   That alone explains CBS' decision, and will explain why most TV
rights deals in the future will likely deal with Internet rights.
Major League Baseball, whose TV deal is up after 2000, already has
a relationship with SportsLine. ESPN has relationships with the NFL
and NBA. But none of those deals came as part of TV rights.
</P>
<P>
   Disney, which wanted the tournament for ABC and ESPN and owns
the ESPN website, didn't include the net in its bid. It won't make
the same mistake again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think each league will look at their own situation and
analyze it separately,'' said McManus. ``Some are farther along
than others in regards to the net and digital television. Everyone
realizes that the best way to maximize revenue is to combine the
net, marketing, merchandise and TV under one umbrella.''
</P>
<P>
   That's called branding, and good business. But exclusivity may
become an even bigger issue.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL limits how much video other broadcast networks can use
of their product on Sundays, and the networks owning Olympic TV
rights has historically been stingy in what it allows anyone else
to show.
</P>
<P>
   CBS theoretically will have control over what other Internet
sites can do with the tournament. It might not be able to keep
ESPN's site from covering the tourney, but it could limit its video
and audio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't decided what kind of exclusivity to carve out,''
McManus said, ``but it could be similar to broadcast TV with
respect to how much video a service can use, and how much is
proprietary. We don't want to be restrictive, but we paid for
exclusivity.''
</P>
<P>
   It could wind up being the best money CBS has ever spent.
</P>
<P>
   AND NOW THE NEWS: ESPN is down to the Top Ten in its
SportsCentury series. Nos.9 and 10 will be profiled Friday. The
remaining 10 (alphabetically): Muhammad Ali, Jim Brown, Babe
Didrikson, Wayne Gretzky, Michael Jordan, Willie Mays, Jack
Nicklaus, Jesse Owens, Babe Ruth and Jim Thorpe. ... VCR alert:
ESPN2 will air a SportsCentury marathon of all of its Top 50
profiles Dec. 30-31. The series produced by Mark Shapiro has
already won Northeastern University's Excellence in Sports
Journalism Award. Tape them so you won't have to pay beaucoup bucks
for the anticipated boxed set. ... Ex-ESPNer Keith Olbermann has
put together his own ``The Century's Real 50 Greatest Athletes''
list and began profiling them this week on Fox Sports News shows.
Terms of his list: No animals, foreign athletes are included, and
athletes who influenced sports in general are given strong
consideration. For example, Curt Flood, who paved the way for free
agency in baseball, is his No.50. The profiles will continue
through Dec. 23. ... CBS' Bryant Gumbel will host the two-hour
``Sports Illustrated's 20th Century Sports Awards,'' Thursday at 9
p.m. SI has named 42 nominees in seven categories (they're featured
in this week's issue) and will name the athlete of the century in
each category on Thursday. Seven athletes Peggy Fleming, Poly High
graduate Billie Jean King, Arnold Palmer, Pele, Richard Petty,
Jackie Robinson and Bill Russell will also be honored as ``Athletes
Who Changed The Game.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   The Big West is close to signing a deal with Fox Sports Net to
televise five games on Thursdays in February and March, and three
of the telecasts will feature Long Beach State. ... USC failed in
its bid for a summary judgment for breach of contract against
former sportscasters Larry Kahn and Mike Lamb as individuals, and
now must decide if they want to pursue that suit in a jury trial.
USC already won a summary judgment against KLM, Kahn and Lamb's
former company. ... Todd Merkow is the new G.M. at Fox Sports Net
in Los Angeles, He's a native and comes from FSN's Arizona unit. He
replaces Kitty Cohen, the longtime Prime Ticket and FSN G.M. who
resigned because of issues with Fox management ... ABC, ESPN and
ESPN2 have signed a deal with the MLS to air 28 games over 19
Saturdays next year. ... The Arena Football League has signed TV
deals with ABC, ESPN, ESPN2 and The Nashville Network (TNN) worth
$25 million over the next three years. ... TVKO had only 850,000
buys for Lewis-Holyfield II, which doesn't bode well for future
heavyweight fights. Maybe the public has finally had its fill of
boxing. ...
</P>
<P>
   THE WORLD OF TV SPORTS ACCORDING TO ME: I realize the Rams are
the best team in the NFC and every Raiders game is close, but I'm a
little tired of the networks stuffing the Rams and Raiders down
L.A.'s TV throat this season. If L.A. liked either team, we
wouldn't have let them leave. ... I've always like the work of
Fox's Matt Millen, but he's straying into Dan Dierdorf's old
territory at ABC by trying to be entertaining and witty at the
expense of substance. He could do worse than watch Dierdorf's work
now at CBS, where he has returned to his old style of sharp
analysis. ... SI's website features its ``Turkeys of the Year,'' a
list that includes one broadcaster, NBC's Jim Gray. They should
have added ABC's Boomer Esiason, who has already clinched the award
as worst network ex-jock hire since NBC hired Joe Montana. ...
Salmonella alert: It's time to retire John Madden's multi-legged
turkey tradition. In a four-point game Thursday between the Lions
and Bears, the last 15 minutes of the telecast was devoted to the
turkey moving from the Maddencruiser to the field. ... Jim
Lampley's work usually draws praise here, but he gets two whacks
for recent comments. Lampley treated analyst George Foreman very
rudely on the Lewis-Holyfield PPV telecast, mocking Foreman's
comments on the fight, and he also went after newspaper reporters
who criticized Jim Gray for his inquisition of Pete Rose while
recently filling in on Jim Rome's syndicated radio talk show.
Lampley invented sideline reporting in his early days at ABC; now
there's a legacy.

ADVERTISING: 15 QUESTIONS ABOUT MADISON AVE. THAT COULD CHANGE YOUR

<TEXT>
<P>
   Typically around holidays, this column presents a feature known
as ``20 Questions,'' examining the foibles of advertising,
marketing and the media. But rather than 20 questions, the focus
these days has been on 15 questions, as in the number of queries
that contestants must answer correctly to win the grand prize on
the phenomenally successful ABC game show, ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   So here is a quiz that could be called ``Who Wants to Be a
Madison Avenue Millionaire.'' Just reading this far has qualified
you, eliminating the need to answer a preliminary question like
``Place all the agencies that work for General Motors in
geographical order from West to East.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember, there are no ``lifelines'' to help you as there are on
TV. But you are not required to ask yourself out loud after each
response, ``Is that my final answer?'' Good luck.

GENE WASHINGTON IS NFL'S TOP COP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gene Washington is on the phone, and the 1965 graduate of Poly
High is discussing a 1987 graduate of Poly High, Mark Carrier, in
grave tones.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time it wasn't tough to do,'' says Washington, referring
to the one-game suspension without pay and $50,000 fine he leveled
the other day against Carrier for an illegal hit that Carrier
perpetrated last Sunday against Green Bay's Antonio Freeman. ``It
was tougher last year for me when I suspended Mark for misusing his
helmet on Tampa Bay's Brice Hunter. But this time it was not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like Mark hasn't been sufficiently warned. This is
the fourth time in three years that we've had to cite him for
improperly using his helmet. His style of play has created a risky
environment for other players. Ironically, Mark is the only player
I've ever had to suspend.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene Washington has met Carrier at several social functions over
the years, and likes him.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, everyone who knows Mark Carrier likes him. He's a
bright, civil fellow with a ready smile, and he's always promoting
some fund-raising event.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't let personal feeling interfere with your better
judgment,'' says Washington. ``Mark has become a head hunter in his
older years, much like Ronnie Lott was in his final years with the
49ers. And that just can't be allowed without some sort of
punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene Washington one-time Stanford and San Francisco 49ers
receiving star has become the NFL's top cop in his position as
director of football operations for the league.
</P>
<P>
   He metes out fines on a weekly basis during the regular season,
and has been carrying out such a task since 1995 after 13 years of
doing radio and TV both in L.A. and San Francisco and also after
serving a couple of years as an associate athletics director at
Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``One paper calls me the `Duke of Discipline,''' says
Washington. ``It's not an easy job. Football is a violent sport,
and there often is such a fine line between a legal hit and an
illegal one. This is terrible that I had to fine Mark such a large
sum. I just wish he could donate the money to the Poly High
Athletic Fund.''
</P>
<P>
   You can be sure that Carrier will be slightly more cautious
during the rest of the season since it's so expensive for him to
keep getting penalized.
</P>
<P>
   It's estimated he blew at least $75,000 for sitting out his
team's Thanksgiving Day game against the Chicago Bears, since he
also lost 1/16th of his $400,000 a year salary (Carrier also had a
$400,000 signing bonus).
</P>
<P>
   Gene Washington came close to re-joining the San Francisco 49ers
in the off-season in an executive position, but decided to remain
with the NFL when Eddie DeBartolo wasn't able to return to the
team.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, it was a good non-move by Washington, considering
the current plight of the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing about my job is that it's never boring,'' he says.
``The nature of it is that I deal in controversy. It's very
challenging. But it's particularly difficult when you have to deal
with someone who went to your high school and grew up in your
area.'' ... .
</P>
<P>
   It won't surprise me if the tough, aggressive D'Cean Bryant is
starting at forward for Long Beach State by the end of the season,
and the versatile, stylish Antrone Lee is switched to the
backcourt. ...
</P>
<P>
   What impresses me most about Wayne Morgan's team so far is its
defensive tenacity. The athletically gifted 49ers figure to create
a lot of turnovers this season. ...
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure Wayne Morgan will settle on a seven or eight-man
rotation by the start of the Big West. I'm sure he realizes
alternating three point guards and shuttling other players in and
out of the lineup isn't exactly conducive to team continuity and
chemistry. ...
</P>
<P>
   Movie fans who savor classic acting performances should check
out Bob Hoskins' amazing work in ``Felicia's Journey.'' It's the
best I've seen since Emily Watson's in ``Breaking The Waves''. ...
</P>
<P>
   Well, Phil Jackson was right. His Lakers simply aren't that good
this year. But how much better will they be next year even with the
prodigal son, Kobe Bryant, in the lineup? ...
</P>
<P>
   I admit it, I'm jealous of Paul Hackett. Here's a guy who makes
a lot more money than I do and yet he's just as incompetent in his
job as I am in mine. Is there no justice in this world whatsoever?
...
</P>
<P>
   The BCS ratings are a sham. Virginia Tech would have two or
three or even four losses if it had to play a Big 10 schedule
rather than the cupcake Big East one that has allowed it to go
undefeated. ...
</P>
<P>
   Does Paul Hackett realize he has a potential superstar in Kareem
Kelly? ...
</P>
<P>
   Now that Brian Barnhart won't be returning, why are the Angels
hesitating in not selecting the only viable candidate to become
Mario Impemba's new radio play-by-play partner, Larry Kahn? ...
</P>
<P>
   Does any area have three better veteran high school football
coaches in it
</P>
<P>
   than this one in Poly's Jerry Jaso, Los Alamitos' John Barnes
and Paramount's Ken Sutch? ...
</P>
<P>
   All my life I wanted to see USC play that great football power,
Louisiana Tech. ...
</P>
<P>
   I find myself every Sunday being a passionate fan of the Oakland
Raiders' opponent. ...
</P>
<P>
   Does Al Davis realize his pregame ritual of prowling the
football field has become pure hokum. ...
</P>
<P>
   With his purchase of a $1.6 million home in Marina Del Rey,
Steve Lavin is certainly more secure about his UCLA future than I
am. ...
</P>
<P>
   It'll be interesting to me in upcoming months who Robert Daly
will have calling the shots for the Dodgers, his close friend, Tom
Lasorda, or that bumbler Kevin Malone. ...
</P>
<P>
   I'm stunned that the San Francisco 49ers released Lawrence
Phillips. ...
</P>
<P>
   Melvin Durslag, Mike (The Night Owl) DiMarzo and all my other
pals are bitterly chiding me and the Brit's New Year's Eve
destination. What's wrong with spending the millennium in Damascus?
I've always wanted to have an audience with Syria's charming
leader, Hafetz al-Assad, anyway.

(mk) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It takes Randy Newman just 2 minutes and 43 seconds to deliver
``The World Isn't Fair,'' the year's most searching song about the
state of the Union on the edge of the millennium, from his recent
album, ``Bad Love.'' Carrying on a one-sided conversation with Karl
Marx, the singer, in his most insinuating pseudo-New Orleans drawl,
regales the dead philosopher with a personal anecdote about
attending a private-school orientation at which the trophy wives
and mothers were as beautiful as princesses, and their husbands
(including himself) looked like frogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be glad that you're dead,'' he tells Marx, after explaining
sadly that the philosopher's idealistic theories, when applied to
real life, ended up bringing only misery. Then he adds: ``Just like
I'm glad I'm living in the land of the free/Where the rich just get
richer/And the poor you don't ever have to see/It would depress us,
Karl/Because we care/That the world isn't fair.'' Ouch!
</P>
<P>
   ``The World Isn't Fair'' is a lean little song for a fat era.
And in cutting against the grain of a pop-music climate in which so
many younger songwriters spill all their feelings out in messy,
sloppily rhymed and metered, often impenetrable five- and
six-minute effusions, it can be taken as an aesthetic guidepost to
this critic's annual adult pop consumer guide.
</P>
<P>
   Another model of restraint, thoughtfulness and craft, from a
different area of music, is Diana Krall's performance of Irving
Berlin's ``Let's Face the Music and Dance,'' on her recent album,
``When I Look in Your Eyes.'' Like Newman's song, this Berlin
classic, from the 1936 movie ``Follow the Fleet,'' silhouettes
present pleasures against the darker backdrop (``soon we will be
without the moon/humming a different tune'') of a looming world
war.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Krall's rendition, half murmured in a dark, slightly husky
alto and delivered with no ornamental frills, is an ominous
countercurrent pulling against a gossamer bossa nova arrangement by
Johnny Mandel. Throughout this album of standards, Ms. Krall
carries forward the intensely focused vocal minimalism of singers
like Peggy Lee and the young Nat ``King'' Cole, injecting a dash of
Carmen McRae's hard-headed psychological insight. Her emotive
understatement and utter lack of exhibitionism attest to her
astonishing integrity in a flamboyant vocal era of improvisatory
showoffs, melismatic overkill and wretchedly excessive belting.
</P>
<P>
   What Newman and Ms. Krall represent, in very different forms, is
an intractable artistic high-mindedness in a contemporary musical
climate overrun and corrupted by marketing. The artistic ill
effects of that marketing mentality are painfully evident on the
latest albums by singers like Celine Dion, Barbra Streisand, Mariah
Carey and Paula Cole. One of several new cuts on ``All the Way: A
Decade of Song'' (Epic/550 Music), Ms. Dion's just-released
greatest hits album, is a gimmicky, beyond-the-grave duet with
Frank Sinatra that sounds as though it were emanating from some
rhinestone-studded station in outer space rather than from the
heart.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of two hardy show tunes, ``Isn't It a Pity''
and ``The Music That Makes Me Dance,'' Ms. Streisand's wedding
album, ``A Love Like Ours'' (Columbia), is a smarmy package of
overproduced, predigested schlock mostly crooned in a voice that
shows the Streisand sound to be intact. But the emotional
risk-taking and commitment to superior songs that made Ms.
Streisand great have all but vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Following the trend toward youthful street music, Ms. Carey is
aggressively pursuing ``street credibility'' on her new, heavily
hip-hop flavored album, ``Rainbow'' (Columbia), and undercutting
her vocal strengths to achieve it.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cole's song lyrics on ``Amen'' (Imago/Warner Brothers), her
follow-up to the hugely successful ``This Fire'' (which contained
the hit ``Where Have All the Cowboys Gone?''), are dragged down by
a forced, strident preachiness that is also mirrored in the
singing.
</P>
<P>
   These and numerous other disappointing adult-oriented albums are
symptoms of a climate in which mainstream pop radio has virtually
eliminated adult contemporary music from its play lists. It used to
be that a powerful, straightforward ballad like Bette Midler's
``From a Distance'' could buck the trends and make its way up the
charts. But those days are gone. As any major-label record company
marketing expert will tell you, releasing an album without a
potential hit single is a commercially risky proposition.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the most startling indication of how far the pop
pendulum has swung toward rude, beat-driven street music was the
MTV Music Video Awards, at which what might be called lout music
(fusions of rap and metal) held sway. Raging testosterone ruled.
</P>
<P>
   What then is an old fogy who still harbors a passion for pop
music to do? Following is a selection of pop and a few jazz albums
(listed alphabetically by artist) recommended for people over 40 or
thereabouts. Some may be challenging for middle-of-the-road tastes.
(Compact discs range in price from $15.97 to $18.97.)
</P>
<P>
   ``TONY BENNETT SINGS ELLINGTON HOT AND COOL'' (RPM/Columbia).
Bennett sings 14 Duke Ellington songs, from swingers to lush
ballads, with his usual heartfelt bonhomie and a swinging authority
that's so assured that rhythm seems to be seeping out of his pores.
But why did he feel obliged to change ``I've Got It Bad (and That
Ain't Good)'' to ``She's Got It Bad''?
</P>
<P>
   ``IBRAHIM FERRER'' (World Circuit/Nonesuch). This great old-time
Cuban singer whose career was resurrected by Ry Cooder's Buena
Vista Social Club has been compared to Nat ``King'' Cole. And there
is a distant resemblance in the relaxed dreaminess of his crooning.
Cooder produced this solo album, in which Ferrer (backed by an
assembly of top-notch Cuban musicians) sings everything from
string-laden boleros that almost seem to float in the air to
harder-edged pre-salsa numbers.
</P>
<P>
   BRYAN FERRY: ``AS TIME GOES BY'' (Virgin). The epitome of
high-toned British suavity with a rock twist applies his twirling
vibrato to 15 popular standards. The loose swinging chamber
arrangements (some with strings) have a Django Reinhardt lilt.
Tasteful and fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ADAM GUETTEL: ``MYTHS AND HYMNS'' (Nonesuch). If the next
generation of theater composers is to rise above the grandiose
schlock of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Frank Wildhorn, Guettel (Richard
Rodgers' grandson) has the melodic brilliance to lead the charge.
His debut album of original music features a top-flight rotating
cast, including the composer, singing songs inspired by Greek myths
and Protestant hymns. Lofty but accessible and intensely
passionate.
</P>
<P>
   ``CHARLIE HADEN AND QUARTET WEST: ``THE ART OF SONG'' (Verve).
In this languidly moody album, the eminent bassist and his group _
the pianist Alan Broadbent, the saxophonist Ernie Watts and the
drummer Larence Marable _ rummage through a collection of standards
with Bill Henderson and Shirley Horn as guest vocalists and a small
orchestra. Killer cuts: Ms. Horn's quiet, string-swaddled versions
of ``I'm Gonna Laugh You Right Out of My Life'' and ``The Folks Who
Live on the Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   FRED HERSCH: ``LET YOURSELF GO'' (Nonesuch). An unaccompanied
solo concert is the ultimate test of a jazz pianist. This
impressive solo album, which includes works by composers ranging
from Weill to Monk (and including an original composition), is
knotty, idea-filled and absorbing. Just when it threatens to become
too intellectual, it relaxes into sunbursts of feeling. It
concludes with a version of ``The Nearness of You'' that Keith
Jarrett might envy.
</P>
<P>
   DIANA KRALL: ``WHEN I LOOK IN YOUR EYES'' (Verve). In her first
orchestrated album (by Johnny Mandel), this British Columbian jazz
singer and pianist takes another huge artistic step forward. Its
heart-stopping centerpiece is the title song, written by Leslie
Bricusse for the movie ``Dr. Doolittle,'' of all things. More
performances like this and Ms. Krall will find herself counted
among the greats.
</P>
<P>
   ALISON KRAUSS: ``FORGET ABOUT IT'' (Rounder). Ms. Krauss'
delicate, silver-threaded voice is one of the tenderest in all
country music. Here she applies it to wistful pop nuggets like Todd
Rundgren's ``It Wouldn't Have Made Any Difference'' and the killer
cut, ``Empty Hearts'' (by Michael McDonald and Michael Johnson).
</P>
<P>
   PAUL McCARTNEY: ``RUN DEVIL RUN'' (Capitol). The former Beatle
revisits the early days of rock 'n' roll with an infectious
exuberance, mixing original '50s-style songs with golden oldies by
Elvis, Ricky Nelson, Chuck Berry and others. Well done.
</P>
<P>
   ME'SHELL NDEGEOCELLO: ``BITTER'' (Maverick). This suite of songs
about sexual betrayal slices to the bone and is delivered in an
intimate speech-song that finds every shade of meaning in the word
``bitter.'' Craig Street's production fleshes out Ms. Ndegeocello's
inner world with a quirky subterranean ambience.
</P>
<P>
   RANDY NEWMAN: ``BAD LOVE'' (DreamWorks). An artistic key to
Newman's serious fun is the way he incriminates himself in his
stinging first-person critiques. One example in ``Bad Love'' is his
admission in ``I Miss You,'' a pining love song to a distant
ex-wife, that he is selling his soul by exploiting their
relationship in the song. And by implicating himself, he implicates
us. As for the music on ``Bad Love,'' it is as spare and allusive
as ever, with styles from New Orleans marching bands to echoes of
Mahler, and with tunes that stick.
</P>
<P>
   BRENDAN PERRY: ``EYE OF THE HUNTER'' (4AD). These arching gothic
folk-pop ballads by the male half of the defunct duo Dead Can Dance
echo the gloomy grandeur of Leonard Cohen, with Perry sounding at
moments like Bruce Springsteen at his most ruminative, with an
added touch of Neil Diamond. The haunting, somewhat morbid album
has the kind of music that inspires cults.
</P>
<P>
   PET SHOP BOYS: ``NIGHTLIFE'' (WEA/Sire). Orchestrally
embellished disco remains the British duo's chosen medium. But the
songs (which deal with gay culture and relationships) continue to
deepen. Songs like ``I Don't Know What You Want But I Can't Give It
Anymore'' and ``You Only Tell Me You Love Me When You're Drunk''
plunge us into the well-heeled urban jungle.
</P>
<P>
   JOHN PRINE: ``IN SPITE OF OURSELVES'' (Oh Boy). The
singer-songwriter, whose voice is as plain as dirt, duets with Iris
DeMent, Lucinda Williams, Trisha Yearwood, Emmylou Harris, Melba
Montgomery and others in this collection of 15 country classics
augmented with one brilliant original, the title song sung with Ms.
DeMent. What you get is the raw texture of life in an idealized,
rollicking portrait of the rural South decades before ``Urban
Cowboy.''
</P>
<P>
   SANTANA: ``SUPERNATURAL'' (Arista). A rare case of inspired
multimarketing savvy (credit the Arista Records chief Clive Davis)
brought the great guitarist Carlos Santana back to the top of the
charts by teaming him with everyone from Dave Matthews (crooning
``Love of My Life'') and the gravelly voiced Rob Thomas (the
pop-salsa hit ``Smooth'') to the hip-hopper Lauryn Hill (``Do You
Like the Way'') to his fellow guitar giant Eric Clapton (the
crunchy, gospel-flavored ``The Calling''). Stylistically diffuse
and gimmicky, but still worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   RON SEXSMITH: ``WHEREABOUTS'' (Interscope). The singer and
songwriter's wonderful third album of pared-down parables and
exquisitely calibrated mood swings is like a private primer of
rueful, sometimes scarily wise apercus. They're rendered without a
wasted word or note in a voice whose shy, quavering intensity
echoes Tim Hardin.
</P>
<P>
   STING: ``BRAND NEW DAY'' (A&AMP;M). Sting's ambition to be all
things to all musical genres, from bossa nova to country to North
African music, can exceed his accomplishment; his country songs
sound forced. But when he lands a knockout punch like ``A Thousand
Years,'' a hypnotic chant that spirals into the stars along a minor
key, pop music doesn't get more deeply entrancing.
</P>
<P>
   ``DAWN UPSHAW SINGS VERNON DUKE'' (Nonesuch). Lovely,
beautifully measured performances of songs by the underappreciated
composer of ``Autumn in New York'' and ``April in Paris.''
</P>
<P>
   CAETANO VELOSO: ``LIVRO'' (Nonesuch). The music on this
far-reaching album by Brazil's greatest singing poet is about as
diverse as that nation's countryside, with feathery love songs
juxtaposed with percussive carnival sambas, and subject matter
ranging from the beauty of books to the life of Alexander the
Great. The album has the color and scope of a sprawling mural
created by a hypersensitive pantheist.
</P>
<P>
   CASSANDRA WILSON: ``TRAVELING MILES'' (Blue Note). Ms. Wilson's
tribute to the spirit of Miles Davis, whose music she has set with
brilliant impressionistic lyrics that mirror his mixture of
romanticism and bitter sarcasm, is an extraordinary collision of
sensibilities. Both as a lyricist and a singer, Ms. Wilson matches
Davis in the depth and twisting complexity of her singing and
writing.
</P>
<P>
   JESSE WINCHESTER: ``GENTLEMAN OF LEISURE'' (Sugar Hill). The
gifted singer-songwriter, seldom heard from since the 1970s (and
even then under-recognized), resurfaces with an album of original
blues and soul-tinged country-folk songs. The lyrics are diamond
hard and confessional. His rich, silky baritone, shot through with
vulnerability, is as compelling as ever. Killer cuts: ``That's What
Makes You Strong'' and ``No Pride at All.''

   On Monday, Clinton is expected to sign the omnibus spending plan
approved by Congress last week. Attached to that bill is the
Satellite Television Home Viewers Act, which will for the first
time enable companies like DirecTV and EchoStar Communications
Corp. to compete with cable television providers on equal footing
by allowing them to carry local TV stations.
</P>
<P>
   The rules eliminate a key stumbling block to competition between
local cable monopolies and satellite providers that offer expansive
channels on a generation of satellite dishes that sell for $100 to
$200. Until now, satellite subscribers also needed a traditional
television antenna or cable service to receive their local news,
sports and weather. Under licensing laws enacted in 1988 to
increase the programming available in rural and other small
markets, satellite companies could not carry local stations but
they could carry network affiliates from other parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   As those provisions approached a January expiration date, the
satellite industry and congressional leaders wanted to expand the
law to enable the satellite companies to carry local programming.
While local affiliates also wanted to be carried by satellite
services, however, they demanded concessions that would prevent the
satellite companies from also beaming in broadcasts from other
affiliates of the same network.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the local stations won provisions that will
prohibit satellite services from carrying another network affiliate
to households within approximately a 75-mile radius of a local
affiliate _ twice the radius to which cable companies must adhere.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of the bill's signing, DirecTV says it will begin
sending local network affiliate stations to its subscribers in New
York City and Los Angeles. And the company says it will be ready to
offer local stations to the top 25 television markets, or about
half of the country's 100 million television households, by
January.
</P>
<P>
   EchoStar says it hopes to have local programming available in 13
markets next week, and in 30 to 35 cities by the end of the first
quarter of next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the stroke of the president's pen, we will begin lighting
up local channels,'' said Bob Marsocci, the communications director
for DirecTV, the leading satellite service, based in El Segundo,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Marsocci said the inability to give households local programs
``has been our No. 1 impediment for potential customers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When they find out local channels are not available, they
don't buy,'' he said. ``This should remove the final barrier to
entry.''
</P>
<P>
   A congressional aide for Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., who heads
the House Commerce Committee, called the legislation the ``the last
piece of the puzzle'' for deregulating the cable industry.
</P>
<P>
   Still, within the satellite television industry, there is
disagreement about just how successful the bill will be in opening
the marketplace to fair competition.
</P>
<P>
   DirecTV, a division of Hughes Electronics Corp., a wholly owned
subsidiary of General Motors, calls the legislation a tremendous
win for consumers, ``finally leveling the playing field between
satellite and cable.''
</P>
<P>
   EchoStar, on the other hand, had aggressively opposed some of
the final provisions, saying Congress caved in to lobbyists.
Perhaps surprisingly, much of the lobbying came from local
broadcasters, not cable companies. In fact, the cable companies
supported the bill for their own political reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Although cable companies have traditionally held monopolies in
their local markets, Congress, as part of its overhaul of
telecommunications laws, deregulated cable rates in 1966 because a
new generation of inexpensive satellite television delivery was
coming on the scene and was considered sufficient competition.
</P>
<P>
   That competition, however, was stifled by the satellite
companies' inability to carry local channels.
</P>
<P>
   The cable companies supported this year's satellite act on the
premise that a piece of pro-competitive legislation was far more
desirable than a return to tighter regulation of their rates,
especially at a time when the cable industry is poised for a new
era of competition in markets for local phone service and
high-speed Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   So the showdown in Congress was between satellite operators and
the local affiliates of networks like ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox, which
do not want to put their local stations in the position of
competing with each other. Represented by the powerful lobbying of
the National Association of Broadcasters, the local stations were
able to thwart several key provisions of the original bill sought
by satellite companies.
</P>
<P>
   EchoStar wanted provisions to guarantee that satellite companies
would not have to pay more than their cable competitors in any
market for the rights to retransmit local broadcasts. Echostar also
opposed a provision requiring satellite companies to carry all
channels in a local market because the provision would require the
company to negotiate separate contracts with each station.
</P>
<P>
   The real fight came over the rules for carrying distant
channels, or network programming from other markets. The bill
codifies a court ruling earlier this year that requires satellite
companies to cut off subscriber access to distant network
programming if viewers are in an area capable of picking up a local
network signal with a traditional antenna.
</P>
<P>
   But a station's theoretical broadcast area is often meaningless
to viewers who cannot get the signal because of interference. That
has left some viewers in a gray area, unable to pick up a clear
local signal and unable to receive distant network broadcasts. With
the new bill, the viewers will be able to receive the local
stations, although there is a bigger blackout area for distant
signals on satellite than cable. Cable companies cannot provide
distant signals to customers within a 35-mile radius of a local
station on the same network. That window is more like 70 miles for
satellite customers.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Echostar's chairman and chief executive, Charlie Ergen, said
earlier this month that the final bill ``limits consumer channel
choices and takes more money out of the consumer's pockets.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is no question that the legislation unlocks true
competition between the satellite and cable industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a perfect bill, `` said Marsocci of DirecTV. ``We
are not happy with every provision, but on balance we do support
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The rates for satellite television are very competitive with
those of most cable services, ranging from under $10 a month for a
basic package to upwards of $100 for access to extensive packages
that include hundreds of channels of digital quality entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The price of satellite dishes required for reception have
dropped as low as $100, and are often accompanied by special deals
on service to help offset the initial purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   Marsocci said his company's new marketing campaign was already
in place, targeting the top 25 television markets just in time for
the holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been gearing up for this and preparing for quite some
time,'' he said. ``We'll be placing primarily print advertisements,
full-page print ads in the daily newspapers in each of the
markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Judi Anne Atencio, director of communications for EchoStar, said
similar plans were in the works at that company's Littleton, Colo.,
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's like yellow tape around the marketing department right
now,'' she said. ``That is a dangerous place to be. The president
is expected to sign the bill around noon on Monday, and about five
minutes later we'll be selling.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Egan, a cable and satellite analyst with Paine Webber in
New York, said consumers would quickly see the effects of the
legislation in the rollout of new services over the next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is going to happen is every few months month there is
going to be a new development,'' he said. ``I think what will
happen is they will try to compete less on price and try to compete
more on services.''
</P>
<P>
   Egan said he expected cable companies to focus their energy on
high-speed Internet and new digital services, while satellite
companies will be focusing on increased programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the beginning. It is going to get very exciting
in the year 2000.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Like the great navigators who first sailed around the world,
establishing its size and the curvature of its surface, astronomers
have made new observations that show with startling directness the
large-scale geometry of the universe and the total amount of matter
and energy that it contains.
</P>
<P>
   The results of those observations have provided powerful support
for an audacious theory, first proposed 20 years ago, that might
help answer the ultimate existential question: what ignited the Big
Bang explosion in which scientists believe the universe was born?
</P>
<P>
   The delicate measurements relied on telescopes placed high on
mountains or borne by balloons to observe slight irregularities, or
ripples, in a faint glow that permeates space and is thought to
have been emitted from the fading fireball of the Big Bang
explosion itself. That glow is called the cosmic microwave
background radiation, and the ripples imprinted on it can be used
like ticks on a ruler to measure the cosmos.
</P>
<P>
   The new data also provide fresh evidence to support a finding
two years ago that expansion of the universe is accelerating under
the influence of a strange form of energy that fills empty space
and apparently acts against gravity. Many researchers had assumed
that the bizarre finding would eventually be disproved, but the new
observations support the existence of this energy, as well as the
theory of what set off the Big Bang, called inflation, which was
first proposed in 1980 by Dr. Alan Guth, a physicist at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has such tremendous implications for the universe,'' Dr.
Rocky Kolb, a cosmologist at the University of Chicago, said of the
new work. Kolb described the range of its implications as
staggering.
</P>
<P>
   One set of results, released Thursday, were obtained by a team
led by scientists at the California Institute of Technology and La
Sapienza, the main campus of the University of Rome, using a
balloon-borne telescope for observing microwaves. A report
describing the results of this so-called Boomerang experiment was
posted on a Web site maintained at the Los Alamos National
Laboratory; it has not yet been subjected to peer review. The Web
site is http://xxx.lanl.gov.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, scientists at Princeton and the University of
Pennsylvania, who placed a telescope on a mountain in Chile,
published similar results in Astrophysical Journal Letters. Dr.
Mark Devlin, from the University of Pennsylvania and a member of
the team that worked in Chile, said, ``These are completely
different experiments with completely different calibrations and
they fall right on top of each other.''
</P>
<P>
   A third team, centered at the University of California at
Berkeley, has also released its preliminary map of the microwave
background, made with another balloon-borne telescope.
</P>
<P>
   The teams' conclusions rest on measurements of the precise size
of the ripples in the microwave background radiation. That size
turns out to be about 1 degree on the sky, or about twice the
apparent size of the full moon as seen from Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the ripples is a direct indicator of the large-scale
geometry of the universe, which, according to Einstein's general
theory of relativity, is in turn determined by the total amount of
matter and energy that the universe contains. Ripples of one degree
indicate a ``flat'' universe, in which parallel lines never cross.
Inflation, the theory of what provided the fuel for the Big Bang,
predicts a universe that is almost exactly flat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing that the universe is flat to amazing precision,''
said Dr. Craig Hogan, a cosmologist at the University of
Washington. ``It's what inflation predicted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically it gets a flat universe dead-on,'' said Dr. Scott
Dodelson, a cosmologist at the University of Chicago. And that
leads astronomers to their next conclusion: because the amount of
matter found by astronomers cannot produce a flat universe,
Dodelson said, ``the inescapable conclusion is that there is some
unknown form of energy contributing to the total density.''
</P>
<P>
   The most likely candidate for that exotic energy, Hogan and
Dodelson said, is what has come to be known as the cosmological
constant, an energy with repulsive gravity that might fill
apparently empty space. Einstein first proposed the concept,
thinking that he needed it to keep the universe from collapsing,
but he later renounced the idea when it was discovered that the
universe was expanding.
</P>
<P>
   The geometry of the universe is determined solely by the amount
of matter and energy contained in it, according to Einstein's
general theory of relativity, which explains gravity as the
``curvature'' of space-time. In a geometrically ``closed''
universe, photons of light, initially traveling parallel to each
other, would eventually converge, just as lines of longitude on
Earth's curved surface meet at the poles.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmologists agree that the universe could have three possible
geometries. Besides the closed geometry, the universe might be open
or flat. In an open geometry, parallel lines would diverge, and in
a flat universe they would simply remain parallel.
</P>
<P>
   Relativity predicts that a closed universe contains more matter
and energy than a certain fixed amount. An open universe contains
less, and a flat universe holds precisely that amount: the one
predicted by Guth's theory.
</P>
<P>
   According to the theory of inflation, a small piece space became
catastrophically stretched by the energy of fields that are
predicted by advanced theories of physics. Those theories unify all
known interactions between particles. No matter how curved that
part of space might have been to begin with, this ``inflation''
would have stretched it out, like the surface of a balloon as it is
blown up, in a tiny fraction of a second and created a flat
universe. The tremendous well of energy in the inflated piece of
space would have served as the fuel for the subsequent fireball of
the Big Bang.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In the present universe, gravity does warp the relatively small
regions of space close to massive objects like the sun, neutron
stars or black holes. Still, some cosmologists had suggested, on
purely aesthetic grounds, that the universe in the large would be
free of curvature. Inflation, with its cosmic stretching, was the
first theory to explain why those suspicions might be true.
</P>
<P>
   But despite that stretching, inflation would also leave telltale
ripples on this exploding, Big Bang universe. The ripples occur
because of principles of quantum mechanics, which impose a kind of
small-scale fuzziness on all particles. The ripples in the
microwave background are thought to be the legacy of that early
quantum fuzziness.
</P>
<P>
   The background radiation, cosmologists believe, was emitted from
the fireball of the Big Bang after the inflationary expansion a few
hundred thousand years after the creation event. The radiation then
traveled through space for some 15 billion years, the present age
of the universe, and arrives at Earth as a sort of cosmic fossil.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ripples themselves were produced during inflation,'' said
Kolb.
</P>
<P>
   Because cosmologists can calculate the actual size of the
ripples in the young universe, their apparent size on the sky is a
measure of whether they traveled to Earth on straight or curved
paths. The paths turned out to be straight, providing the main
piece of evidence for the flat universe.
</P>
<P>
   The Boomerang experiment measured the ripples using a telescope
based on reflecting, aluminum optics and a cooled, semiconducting
detector that looks like a tiny spider web, said Dr. Paolo de
Bernardis, an astrophysicist at La Sapienza, who is a principal
investigator of the Boomerang experiment. The microwaves heat the
detector very slightly, and that change is converted into an
electronic signal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system is so cool and so clean that you can detect these
changes in the system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Maxima experiment, based at Berkeley, used a related
balloon-borne system. The Microwave Anistropy Telescope, which made
its own measurements from a mountain in Chile, used an entirely
different detector based on powerful electronic amplifiers.
</P>
<P>
   All of the data are consistent with a flat universe, said
scientists on the projects and others who have read the teams'
reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``These really favor a flat universe,'' said Dr. Alessandro
Melchiorri, an astrophysicist at La Sapienza.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Two scientists at Bell Laboratories in New Jersey, Dr. Arno A.
Penzias and Dr. Robert W. Wilson, discovered the cosmic microwave
background by accident in 1965, and received a Nobel Prize for
their discovery in 1978. Equipment of that era was not sensitive
enough to see ripples in the radiation, so Penzias and Wilson
detected it as a smooth glow or hiss.
</P>
<P>
   Kolb of the University of Chicago said that the new results
easily represented the biggest step in the field since NASA's
Cosmic Microwave Background Explorer first saw the barest outlines
of the ripples in 1992. Even that satellite could not detect the
much tinier ripples that have been measured by the new telescopes.
Kolb described the reaction of inflationary cosmologists to the new
data as one of ``guarded euphoria.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists on all the experiments said that even more precise
data were soon to be published, offering the promise of even
tighter tests of inflation, and of the geometry and contents of the
universe. De Barnardis said that his team had made even more
accurate microwave observations that would be made available within
the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``You haven't seen anything yet,'' said Dr. Adrian T. Lee, a
Maxima collaborator at Berkeley. ``We are entering the era of
precision cosmology.''

   GAME OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay (6-4) at Seattle (8-2), 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   These teams have rosters full of sleek, determined players and
both are capable of making a bruising playoff run. For Tampa Bay,
quarterback Trent Dilfer has begun to help his team more than hurt
it. For Seattle, quarterback John Kitna has passed for 1,888 yards,
16 touchdowns and six interceptions. Coach Mike Holmgren's move to
allow Warren Moon to leave for Kansas City and ride Kitna was
controversial initially, brilliant now. The game features two of
pro football's most glamorous defensive linemen _ Warren Sapp for
Tampa Bay and Cortez Kennedy for Seattle. Expect Sapp to dictate
the game in stronger fashion. So, too, will the Tampa Bay defense.
This unexpected victory makes National Conference teams take note
of Tampa Bay as a dangerous playoff threat.
</P>
<P>
   Buccaneers, 17-16.
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY 1 P.M. GAMES:
</P>
<P>
   Arizona (4-6) at Giants (5-5)
</P>
<P>
   Arizona is not a playoff team and the Giants of late have not
looked like one, either. The Giants offense has been a grinding,
halting, ugly show all season long, but it looks for a jolt from
quarterback Kerry Collins. He makes his first Giants start and is
considered the quarterback for the rest of this season and beyond.
Collins possesses the tools _ nice size, strong arm, maturity and
control in the pocket. He must throw the ball downfield, loosen the
Cardinals defense and open the running game. Collins realizes the
opportunity and will be prepared. The Giants show new life.
</P>
<P>
   Giants, 23-10.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville (9-1) at Baltimore (4-6)
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago the Ravens traveled to the Jaguars and held them
to six points. The problem was the Ravens could only score three
and lost. Not this time. Baltimore scored 34 last week in beating
Cincinnati but, of course, the Bengals' defense is a universe away
from the Jaguars' defense. There are numbers in Baltimore's favor:
its defense has allowed only one rushing touchdown in its last 23
quarters; it allows an average of only 3.2 rushing yards per carry;
Ravens running back Errict Rhett averages 3.8 yards per carry; and
quarterback Tony Banks has thrown more touchdowns (four) than
interceptions (two). Baltimore has never beaten Jacksonville,
having lost all seven encounters. It's time for a change.
</P>
<P>
   Ravens, 14-13.
</P>
<P>
   New England (6-4) at Buffalo (7-4)
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are in a swoon, having lost consecutive divisional
games to the Jets and Dolphins and now find themselves in panic
mode. That could be good for a team that tends to fight best when
cornered. New England meets a club that is hot at home: Buffalo has
won 10 of its last 12 home games and is 4-1 there this season.
Also, Bills quarterback Doug Flutie is 15-2 in home games during
his NFL career. New England quarterback Drew Bledsoe has accepted
the blame for his team's poor showing in its last two games and he
is determined to rise. New England should gain good field position
from return man Kevin Faulk, who ranks second among rookies in
kickoff returns. It needs a monster game from end Willie McGinnest
and gets it.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots, 22-20.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans (2-8) at St. Louis (8-2)
</P>
<P>
   Saints rookie back Ricky Williams has rushed for an NFC
rookie-most 816 yards and 524 of those have come in his last five
games. He is on pace for a 1,306-yard rushing season and could
become the Saints first 1,000-yard back in 11 years (Dalton
Hilliard gained 1,262 in 1989). As far as bright spots, that's it
for the Saints. They cannot contain Kurt Warner to Isaac Bruce (11
touchdowns). They can't block end Kevin Carter (11.5 sacks, tops in
the league). The Rams have scored more points (323) than any team.
They can swipe their divisional crown if they win and Carolina
loses. It would be the Rams first in 14 years. It would also match
the 1985 Chicago Bears for earliest title clinch (11 games) in a
16-game season. St. Louis will do its part and hope Carolina
obliges.
</P>
<P>
   Rams, 31-17.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia (3-8) at Washington (6-4)
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles tripped the Redskins 35-28 two weeks ago in a game
that could have sent the Redskins into a deep tailspin. It did not.
Washington recovered, beat the Giants, and recaptured first place
in the NFC East. Washington will not allow Philadelphia to
duplicate the initial upset. Washington has too much going for it _
the league's leading rusher in Stephen Davis, a big-play passer in
Brad Johnson and an inconsistent defense that played efficiently
against the Giants. Receiver Albert Connell (41 catches, 771 yards,
an 18.8 average yards gained per catch and six touchdowns) will get
Washington going. Then they roll.
</P>
<P>
   Redskins, 27-10.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati (1-10) at Pittsburgh (5-5)
</P>
<P>
   When in the doldrums, when losing, confused and angry, play the
Bengals. The Pittsburgh offense is in flux, but for this game,
anyway, Kordell Stewart finds open receivers, Jerome Bettis finds
open running lanes and the Pittsburgh defense, led by linebackers
Jason Gilden (7.5 sacks) and Levon Kirkland, strangles Cincinnati.
Pittsburgh has allowed only five touchdowns in its last 20 quarters
and its defense ranks second in the league in third-down conversion
rate allowed at 28.7 percent. Defense has never been the problem
this season for Pittsburgh. Offense has. Pittsburgh fans say thank
goodness for the Bengals.
</P>
<P>
   Steelers, 24-7.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   San Diego (4-6) at Minnesota (6-4)
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings have won four straight and this one makes five. Jeff
George has yet to blow up. Most think he eventually will, but for
now he has provided stability and intelligence at quarterback for
Minnesota. His smartest move? Relentlessly seeking receiver Cris
Carter. Good things happen when Carter touches the ball. He is one
of the game's best third-down receivers. He needs two catches to
become the league's fourth player all-time with 900 or more
receptions. Carter is averaging 13.4 yards per catch, his highest
since matching that number eight years ago. George to Carter
becomes this game's staple.
</P>
<P>
   Vikings, 21-7.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee (8-2) at Cleveland (2-9)
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee has won 12 consecutive divisional games. It has not
allowed a 100-yard rusher this season. Its defense has scored three
safeties. Offensively, the Titans roar when the legs of quarterback
Steve McNair and running back Eddie George churn. When McNair has
rushed for a touchdown this season Tennessee is 4-0 and all-time is
13-2. George rushed for 494 yards in his last five games compared
with only 277 in his first five. Receiver Yancey Thigpen returns
for Tennessee after sitting out last week's victory over Pittsburgh
with an injured ankle. That simply gives Tennessee another weapon
against a team it already towers over.
</P>
<P>
   Titans, 23-12.
</P>
<P>
   4 P.M. GAMES
</P>
<P>
   Jets (4-6) at Indianapolis (8-2)
</P>
<P>
   With all of the adversity and drama the Jets have faced this
season, their defense has stood tall. Credit Bill Belichick, the
defensive coordinator, for one of his finest coaching seasons. In
their last seven games, the Jets defense has allowed an average of
14.3 points per game. Add the consistent and inspiring play of
quarterback Ray Lucas and the Jets have finally found a formula for
winning. They could have beaten the Colts the last time except for
a hurried Jets pass near the Colts goal line that was intercepted
and returned; it set up a last-second, game-winning field goal in
the Colts' 16-13 victory. Lucas and coach Bill Parcells won't make
the same mistake. It's an upset.
</P>
<P>
   Jets, 20-17.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City (5-5) at Oakland (5-5)
</P>
<P>
   Both teams have six games left, both have identical records and
both play in the same division. Is this a big game? You bet. The
winner could rise, the loser completely sink in the AFC playoff
picture. Kansas City has won four straight over the Raiders. The
Chiefs often play their best football against them in one of the
league's longest and fiercest rivalries, which the Chiefs lead
39-36-2. Chiefs linebacker Derrick Thomas has nine sacks in his
last three games vs. the Raiders. He will harass quarterback Rich
Gannon. And the Chiefs continue their streak in this series.
</P>
<P>
   Chiefs, 28-24.
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY NIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta (2-8) at Carolina (4-6)
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons last season earned a trip to the Super Bowl in part
by forcing turnovers and committing few. This season has been the
opposite. They face a hot quarterback in Steve Beuerlein who
completed 21 of 27 (77.7 percent) passes for 199 yards, two
touchdowns and no interceptions in Carolina's 31-17 victory over
Cleveland last week. Carolina at home this season has outscored
four opponents by 89-56. Watch Panthers return man Michael Bates,
who returned a kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown vs. Atlanta
earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
   Panthers, 26-20.
</P>
<P>
   MONDAY NIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay (5-5) at San Francisco (3-7)
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay Coach Ray Rhodes has never beaten the 49ers, a team he
used to coach as defensive coordinator. This is a wonderful chance.
The 49ers are downtrodden and miss Steve Young. Without him, few of
their deficiencies can be masked. This game will improve Green
Bay's playoff hopes and put San Francisco's season in a
let's-just-get-it-over-with spin. Receiver Antonio Freeman will
produce a big game and the Green Bay defense will frustrate 49ers
quarterback Steve Stenstrom. Under the bright lights of Monday
night, San Francisco's varied troubles will be fully exposed.
</P>
<P>
   Packers, 30-20.

USC DIDN'T KNOW HOW GOOD LOUISIANA TECH WOULD BECOME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ File this one in the ``sure looked good at the
time'' folder.
</P>
<P>
   It's spring 1998, and USC, under a mandate from new coach Paul
Hackett to schedule the maximum 12 games his first two seasons, is
looking for an opponent for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, two opponents. The Trojans initially agreed to play
then-lowly Hawaii in the season opener. And under NCAA rules, a
trip to the islands doesn't count against your schedule, so USC was
still allowed to add another game.
</P>
<P>
   With an opening on Thanksgiving weekend, the only team
interested was Louisiana Tech, and how good could they be?
</P>
<P>
   A USC official beamed last fall that Tech wide receiver Troy
Edwards was a senior and would be in the NFL by the time the
Bulldogs came to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But did anyone know just how good quarterback Tim Rattay could
become?
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, this isn't such a fun game, as Rattay has placed
red-hot Louisiana Tech in the Top 25 for today's contest at the
Coliseum (3:30 p.m.). If you believe The New York Times computer
poll, the Bulldogs are the eighth-best team in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun to get up there and I think we definitely deserve
it,'' Rattay said. ``We've earned it and it's really something
special.''
</P>
<P>
   Rattay has averaged nearly 386 yards passing per game, which
will go down as the best mark in NCAA history. And if leading the
Bulldogs (8-2) to eight straight victories and into the Top 25
isn't enough, he's also trying to get his team into a bowl game.
</P>
<P>
   The only remaining at-large bid is the Motor City Bowl, and
Louisiana Tech probably needs a victory to secure a matchup with
Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to give USC (5-6) cause for pause, especially while
still enjoying its 17-7 victory over UCLA last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'd better be ready and prepared or we'll be
embarrassed on our own field,'' USC strong safety Ife Ohalete said.
``I don't want to be embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Hackett: ``We've just got to be able to push UCLA and
Thanksgiving aside and take care of business. It's going to be a
battle for our football team.''
</P>
<P>
   This has all the earmarks of a 42-41 contest because it may be
difficult for the Trojans to adjust to Louisiana Tech's wide-open
offense, which routinely has four, five or six receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't even been attempting to run,'' cornerback Kris
Richard said. ``They're going to be coming into the game with a lot
of confidence and we'll be the spoiler.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an interesting role reversal, but is something I have
accepted. I'm taking this game as a big push into next season. This
is our first ranked team we'll be playing all year. We don't want
to go out as losers.''
</P>
<P>
   As if Louisiana Tech needed any extra motivation, coach Jack
Bicknell III will be eager to beat the Trojans. His father, Jack
Bicknell, the former Boston College coach, lost a pair of games
against USC in 1987-88.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's 0-2 so I've got to try to break the string for the
family,'' Bicknell said. ``I can remember one game was at Boston
College and I was an assistant at New Hampshire, and I came down
and watched it, and we got beat pretty good.''

VIGIL HONORS BONFIRE COLLAPSE VICTIMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ The sun dipped behind the engineering
building at Texas A&AMP;M University shortly before 6 Thursday night.
Truth is, though, darkness hasn't left this place for a week now.
</P>
<P>
   But tens of thousands of candles pierced that darkness Thursday
night, cradled in the hands of tens of thousands of people, young
and old, who gathered on Thanksgiving evening where a tragic
accident killed 12 Aggies and injured 27 others a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   The somber candlelight vigil was held on a night usually
reserved for a spirited pep rally and lighting of the traditional
massive bonfire before the annual football game against the
University of Texas. The deadly collapse of the bonfire stack Nov.
18 led university officials to cancel its lighting this year.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, many turned out to pray and to say goodbye. And they
turned out to heal.
</P>
<P>
   Johnette Jarvis, a 1970 A&AMP;M graduate and the mother of two
current students, said the outpouring of emotion from Aggies past
and present has been ``wonderfully supportive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look around, and you see all of this, you get some
peace,'' said Jarvis, a resident of Gruver, north of Amarillo at
the top of the Texas Panhandle.
</P>
<P>
   Many mourners arrived hours before the vigil. Wearing ribbons,
they held hands, whispered among themselves and cried. Their
candles enveloped the fenced-off bonfire site in flickering light.
</P>
<P>
   The makeshift memorial for the dead continued to build. Flowers,
tributes to the dead and messages of hope have helped in the
healing, many said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could never have imagined this tragedy,'' said senior
Tiffany Barfield of Palestine, a member of a student organization
called the Traditions Council. ``We've gotten so much support from
around Texas, really all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas A&AMP;M is a family,'' she said. ``This has been extremely
hard on the community and all Aggies. This helps us get through it.
Just look how many people have come out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherylon Carroll, associate director of university relations,
said the vigil drew about 100,000 people. Last year, attendance at
the bonfire was about 70,000.
</P>
<P>
   Families of the victims ``can look at this and see that people
really care about them here,'' said Mike Payne of Price, a 1975
graduate who helped build the bonfire stack when he was a student.
``My feelings right now are with the families. I can't imagine what
they're going through.''
</P>
<P>
   Two students remained hospitalized Thursday, including John
Comstock of Richardson, who was in critical condition at College
Station Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Several fans of the University of Texas, who were in town for
the Longhorns' annual showdown with the Aggies on Friday, came to
pay their respects. In turn, the Aggies said thanks.
</P>
<P>
   One sign along Farm Road 60, which leads into College Station
from the southwest, said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Horns. Thanks for your care and support. God bless you.''
</P>
<P>
   Within an hour after the vigil began, thousands of mourners
marched to Kyle Field about a mile away to participate in A&AMP;M's
annual Yell Practice, another part of the Aggie tradition.
</P>
<P>
   University officials have said they won't decide the fate of the
90-year-old bonfire tradition until their investigation is
complete. A task force will be appointed to oversee the
investigation.

TO HIS CHAGRIN, JIMMY JOHNSON SEES THE OLD COWBOYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Jimmy Johnson looked up and through the Texas
Stadium roof. Yes, the hole was still there. He looked left and
right saw 64,328 fans who had come to watch him stroll these
sidelines once again and to view his new team, the Miami Dolphins.
He looked across the field and recognized the blue and white
uniforms, the blue star, the Dallas Cowboys. The team he had
coached for five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   He looked onto the field and he easily recognized the players.
</P>
<P>
   And on this Thanksgiving Day, they looked a lot like the bunch
that twice won him Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Playing with fever-pitch intensity and purpose, and ruining
Johnson's return, Dallas ripped Miami, 20-0. It was a startling
display, in which the Dallas defense intercepted Dan Marino five
times. The defense also watched as Miami missed three field goals.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins fell to 8-3 and the Cowboys improved to 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas offense won the yardage battle, 324 yards to 273
yards, and kept the ball for nearly 10 more minutes than Miami.
</P>
<P>
   For 60 minutes Dallas rose, and looked far superior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Superstars when they are challenged are dangerous,'' Johnson
said of the Cowboys. ``It was national TV and they were challenged.
They played great.''
</P>
<P>
   They did so from the start. Dolphins place kicker Olindo Mare
missed a 52-yard field goal late in the first quarter. Then, early
in the second quarter, with Miami at the Dallas 9-yard line, Deion
Sanders, in the end zone, grabbed a Marino pass that had been
tipped and bobbled by safety George Teague.
</P>
<P>
   Just before halftime, Mare missed a 47-yard field goal. Mare
entered the game having converted 29 of 32 field goal attempts this
season. He would match his season total of misses in this game.
</P>
<P>
   Miami gained a clue after a scoreless first half _ it was in for
a testy fight and the ball and the momentum was not bouncing its
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's going to have on and off days,'' Miami linebacker
Zach Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a lot of mistakes,'' said Miami cornerback Terrell
Buckley. ``We just wanted the team to play well. That didn't
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Both quarterbacks _ Marino and the Cowboys' Troy Aikman _ were
returning from injuries and layoff. Marino had suffered a shoulder
injury, Aikman a concussion, and both had to find their grooves.
Marino was 14 of 35 for 176 yards with those five interceptions and
a long pass of only 27 yards. Aikman was 16 of 29 for 232 yards
with one touchdown, no interceptions and a long pass of 65 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Miami entered with a more glamorous defense.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas cornerback Charlie Williams said every Dallas defensive
player noticed the attention the Miami defense had received.
Williams said: ``We took it upon ourselves to win this game with
defense. We talked about it all week. We just said we gotta go
play. We knew they had the better defense in reputation. So, we
just did our thing.''
</P>
<P>
   They did it for points in the third quarter, completely changing
the game's complexion.
</P>
<P>
   With 7:08 remaining in the third quarter, linebacker Dexter
Coakley stepped in front of a Marino pass and ran it back 46 yards
for a touchdown. In a scoreless game, a defensive duel, the Dallas
defense had struck gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked out into the flat and when I saw the ball coming I
prayed that I would not drop it,'' Coakley said. ``When I caught
it, all I thought about was getting into the end zone. The sky is
the limit for us if we can stick together and stay focused. We can
be a very good team.''
</P>
<P>
   Coakley's play set the tone for the fourth quarter. More Miami
turnovers. More Dallas domination.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas wrapped up the victory in the fourth quarter with Rocket
Ismail's 65-yard touchdown catch sandwiched between two field
goals.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami offense continued to wilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the game I felt pretty good,'' Marino said. ``Right now
I don't feel well at all. They didn't do anything that we didn't
expect they'd do. We really didn't adjust to anything either. I
didn't make good decisions. It was missing, it was a timing thing.
I wasn't doing things to give us a chance to win. I had two
practices before this game. I'm not making excuses, but it's going
to take some time to get back into rhythm. I'm going to learn from
this. It's the only way I know how to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas learned something, too.
</P>
<P>
   It can be better than a .500 team.
</P>
<P>
   It stood tall in Johnson's return under tremendous scrutiny,
winning a game few thought it could. It made Dallas owner Jerry
Jones beam with pride. It made Cowboys coach Chan Gailey hopeful
while remaining unbeaten (5-0) at home this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really proud of what we did, and our defense is getting
better and better,'' Gailey said. ``Our defense just may be able to
get us a long way. I said it earlier, you can't be 11-5 without
going 6-5 first. Now that we are 6-5, we just have to keep working
hard.''  &QL;

   NATIONS BEGIN TO RESTRICT THEIR PLANTS AND WILDLIFE
</P>
<P>
   Many developing countries, angry that others have profited from
the animal and plant life within their borders, have begun
restricting the freedom of scientists to collect biological samples
and are demanding compensation in exchange for permits.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists warn that scores of research projects that might
lead to breakthroughs in medicine and agriculture, as well as to
the study and preservation of endangered species, are being impeded

BOXER WHO YEARNED FOR A TITLE WINDS UP IN A COMA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the promoter called in September to offer him a chance to
fight in Atlantic City, N.J., Stephan Johnson knew it would
probably be his last chance to become a contender for a world title
fight and the big payday that had eluded him for his entire career.
</P>
<P>
   But something went horribly wrong last Sunday in the ring at the
Taj Mahal casino. Johnson was fighting Paul Vaden for the U.S.
Boxing Association junior middleweight championship, a relatively
meaningless belt that both men saw as a steppingstone to a world
title fight.
</P>
<P>
   Though the judges said he outboxed Vaden through nine rounds,
Johnson suddenly lost consciousness at the end of the 10th after
Vaden delivered what appeared to be two fairly light blows. Johnson
never woke up.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 31, has been in a coma at the Atlantic City Medical
Center ever since. He has remained in critical condition attached
to a respirator, while his mother, sister, trainer and girlfriend
have waited in a nearby room. Doctors have diagnosed his condition
as subdural hematoma, a buildup of blood between the brain and the
skull.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is such a gladiator,'' his manager and trainer, Kenneth
Woods, said on Wednesday, taking a break from the hospital vigil.
``He was always one fight away from hitting the big time.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's story is not so different from the lives of thousands
of young men from poor neighborhoods around the world who seek
solace in boxing gyms and sacrifice their bodies for the slim
chance of fame and fortune. His dream of a title fight is every
journeyman boxer's dream. His coma is their nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson might have pushed his body one step too far in
pursuit of that dream, and questions have been raised about his
health before the last fight, his friends and former trainers say.
</P>
<P>
   He had suffered a similar knockout during a fight against Fitz
Vanderpool in Toronto last April, falling unconscious after a
series of light blows when he had dominated most of the fight. He
later blamed the loss on dehydration, but the boxing authorities in
Ontario ordered a battery of tests and suspended him from fighting
in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   After that fight, Johnson confided in friends that he was
seriously considering giving up boxing to become a full-time
fitness instructor. He knew promoters saw him as what is known as a
trial horse, a fighter past his prime but good enough to test
newcomers on the way up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew that the chances for him getting a world title were
slim,'' said Brian Adams, a friend. ``He wanted to get away from
it. It was becoming just routine for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also had aspirations to become a writer and had shown
friends fiction, poetry and a screenplay he had written, all gritty
tales about the boxing world. He was one of the few fighters at
Gleason's Gym in Brooklyn who scribbled notes in a composition book
when inspiration hit, his friends said.
</P>
<P>
   But the lure of one last chance to get to the top was too much
to ignore, his trainers and friends said. He had grown up in
Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant section and learned to box at 13
after he wandered into the New Bed-Stuy Boxing Association, the gym
that produced an Olympic champion, Mark Breland, and he fell in
love with the sport.
</P>
<P>
   A Career Just Short of a Contender's
</P>
<P>
   Like many kids in his hard and unforgiving neighborhood, Johnson
came from poverty and saw prizefighting as a way out. He won his
division in the 1986 Empire State Games and became a professional
the next year. He was only 19.
</P>
<P>
   Early in his career Johnson won more than he lost and got an
opportunity to fight such top-flight middleweights as Roy Jones
Jr., Willy Wise, Vincent Pettway and Wilfredo Rivera. He had fast
hands and quick feet, but he always seemed to come up a little
short in fights that would have made him a contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always had a lack of concentration,'' said Carlos Ortiz, a
former lightweight champion who trained Johnson until 1994. ``He's
a great kid. He has a lot of ability and a good sense of the sport.
But he becomes distracted and then he gets hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz said he urged Johnson to retire after he lost a 12-round
bout to Rivera in 1993. Rivera gave Johnson such a beating that his
retina became detached, requiring him to take a year off. He
started teaching boxing at New York fitness clubs to make money.
</P>
<P>
   Under a new trainer, Johnson tried to come back in 1996 and
1997, but lost his two fights. It looked as if his professional
career was over after Andrew Lewis knocked him out in six rounds in
June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But the next year Woods agreed to take over as Johnson's
trainer. Woods thought Johnson's problem was impatience: too often
he tried to slug it out instead of boxing his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   That fall, Woods got Johnson a match in Georgia against Sam
Garr, an up-and-coming welterweight. State officials said privately
that the promoters chose Johnson as a last-minute replacement for
another fighter because they considered him a weak opponent and
wanted to build up Garr's record. But Johnson surprised everyone
and knocked out Garr in five rounds.
</P>
<P>
   That victory led to the matchup with Vanderpool last April, a
fight that would have made Johnson a contender in his division
again. But he had trouble losing enough weight to get under the
150-pound limit for superwelterweights required by Canadian rules,
Woods said. Dehydrated and perhaps weak from training to lose
weight, Johnson went down in the 11th round and had to be taken to
a hospital for the night.
</P>
<P>
   On the flight back to New York the next morning, Johnson was
severely depressed, Woods said. ``He asked me what did I think he
should do in terms of retiring,'' the trainer recalled. ``I told
him I thought he would be better if he didn't fight anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want him to box anymore, but I told him he was a
grown man and the decision was his,'' Woods added.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, Johnson called Woods at his home in Charlotte,
N.C., and said he wanted to continue fighting, Woods said, and the
trainer returned to New York. That month, Woods said, Johnson had a
battery of tests done, including a CAT scan at Mount Sinai
Hospital, and was told he was in good health.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking his fighter needed to get his confidence back, Woods
promptly procured Johnson a bout in Greenville, S.C., against
Otilio Villarreal on Aug. 7, in which Johnson won a decision. Then
Woods matched Johnson against Calvin Moody in Albany, Ga., in early
October. Moody was clearly outclassed, and Johnson knocked him out
in the third round.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   $10,000, and a Shot at a World Title
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson's break appeared to come before the Moody fight,
when Carl Moretti, a matchmaker for Main Events, called to ask if
Johnson would be willing to fight Vaden in Atlantic City. He would
be paid $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, it seemed a good matchup, Moretti said. The main
attraction of the evening was to be a heavyweight bout between
Andrew Golota and Michael Grant, to be broadcast on television by
HBO. Because Vaden shares a manager with Grant, he was put on the
fight card in the earlier fight as a ritual courtesy.
</P>
<P>
   Moretti said he chose Johnson as an opponent partly because he
was from New York and could attract a local crowd and partly
because both fighters were older warriors trying to make a
comeback.
</P>
<P>
   The USBA's junior middleweight championship was vacant because
the previous champion had literally outgrown the weight class.
Vaden, a former champion whose career had taken a downward turn,
was looking to become a contender again and a chance to fight
Fernando Vargas for the IBF belt.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was also trying to climb back up the rankings, Moretti
said. Moretti said the questions raised in his mind by Johnson's
loss in Toronto had been outweighed by his two more recent
victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being 31 years old, he's probably a step past his prime, but
good enough to fight and compete,'' Moretti said. ``In no way do I
consider him a washed-up journeyman.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Woods said, he and Johnson met with officials from the
IBF ranking committee before agreeing to the fight. The officials
promised, he said, that if Johnson, who had a record of 26-8-1
before the fight, were to beat Vaden, he would be ranked a
contender to fight Vargas. That would mean at least one big purse
before retirement, Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew his time as a boxer was coming to an end,'' Woods
said. ``It was my job to get him the most money at the least
risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson did not disappoint the promoters, Moretti said. He
fought well and was leading on two of the three judges' score
cards, until the 10th round, when his world went black in a
flicker.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear how Johnson managed to fight three times in
three states while still under suspension for medical reasons in
Ontario. As a general practice, state boxing commissions will not
allow a fighter who has been knocked out in another jurisdiction to
fight until he has satisfied the authorities in that jurisdiction
that he is medically fit.
</P>
<P>
   But Ken Hayaschi, the Ontario athletics commissioner, said
Johnson had remained suspended in Canada. Although, in June,
Johnson sent Hayaschi the results of a CAT scan done at Mount Sinai
Hospital, he never sent two other neurological tests required under
Canadian law.
</P>
<P>
   Boxing officials in New Jersey said that before approving the
fight on Sunday, they reviewed a CAT scan and other tests that
Johnson presented to them. Boxing officials in Georgia said they
initially told promoters that Johnson could not fight in October
because of the Canadian suspension, but reversed themselves when
they learned from Fight Fax, a private records company, that the
suspension had been lifted. That report was erroneous, Hayaschi
said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in South Carolina could not be reached for comment on
Wednesday, but Woods said they had asked to see copies of Johnson's
CAT scan results before approving the fight there in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``But something was wrong,'' Woods acknowledged. ``There was
obviously some injury that they didn't pick up.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxing as a Metaphor for a Fighter's Life
</P>
<P>
   While Johnson has lain in the intensive-care unit, his family
has received hundreds of calls from his friends, fellow fighters
and students. Johnson was a popular teacher at the Equinox Health
Club in New York, where he trained professionals in the science of
boxing.
</P>
<P>
   His level of fitness was legendary at the club. He regularly
asked his students to do 100 push-ups with him, and when he got to
the last five, he did them on his thumbs, they said. More than 100
of his students went to Atlantic City to see him fight on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   His friends say Johnson's life centered on boxing and staying in
shape. He prided himself on eating healthy foods and started most
mornings with push-ups and a long run. After teaching fitness
classes all afternoon, he trained at Gleason's Gym every evening.
``Stephan was a health nut,'' Adams, his friend, said.
</P>
<P>
   But boxing was also something of a religion for him, they said.
Johnson relaxed by watching videos of old fights. He read
voraciously, usually about the lives of other fighters and the
history of the sport. He could often be found with a biography
under his arm. Boxing was the inspiration for his own writing, they
said, as well as the spiritual metaphor he used to understand his
life. He saw his defeats as lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boxing was a vehicle for Stephan,'' one of his students,
Charles Jamison, said. ``As much as it was a defining part of his
life, it was only part of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jamison said, the temptation of one last shot at a title
was one Johnson could not resist. ``He thought that if he was able
to prove himself as a legitimate contender by virtue of this
fight,'' Jamison said, ``he would get a shot.''

AFTER TWO-WEEK SLIDE, LIONS FIND WAY TO WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTIAC, Mich. _ The Detroit Lions had spent the last two weeks
trying to reclaim their mojo. It was lost somewhere in the Arizona
desert when coach Bobby Ross made one of those inexplicable calls,
going for a two-point conversion against the Cardinals when he
should have kicked the extra point. That loss was followed by a
loss to Green Bay last week in which safety Mark Carrier illegally
used his head as a weapon, leading to his suspension for Thursday's
game.
</P>
<P>
   Two straight awkward defeats and suddenly the Lions, until then
the toast of the league, were lost, like someone crawling on the
floor looking for dropped contact lenses.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Chicago. The travel-weary Bears played in San Diego on
Sunday and should have been an easy target. But as the margin of
the Lions' 21-17 victory on Thanksgiving Day indicated, Detroit did
not exactly beat the stuffing out of its opponent.
</P>
<P>
   With backup quarterback Gus Frerotte starting for the injured
Charlie Batch, Barry Sanders still retired and two members of the
starting secondary watching from the sideline, the Lions still
exploded to a 21-0 first-half lead. The only problem was that they
allowed Chicago to get back in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line for the Lions, now 7-4, is that they remain in
the thick of the NFC Central race with a half-game lead. With games
coming against Washington, Tampa Bay and Minnesota, the Bears (5-7)
were the easy part of Detroit's final six games.
</P>
<P>
   What saved the Lions was, first, playing at home. On
Thanksgiving Day this decade, Detroit is 6-1. Home cooking agrees
with the Lions.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the Lions, as they have most of this season,
kept their poise in the most difficult of circumstances. Even in
their two recent losses, the Lions never gave up. Detroit may have
blown a 21-0 second-quarter lead against the Bears, but it was how
the team reacted when seriously threatened late in the game that
counted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we hung in there pretty good,'' Ross said. ``I've said
from Day 1 I think this team has an awful lot of character and they
won't lay down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lions used a patient, ball-control offense, dominated by a
short passing game, to wear out the Bears, who looked tired in the
fourth quarter. Frerotte, subbing for Batch, who is still nursing a
sore thumb, hit nine different receivers while completing 29 of 42
passes for 309 yards. Most were of the short variety and designed
to take advantage of the speed of Detroit's backs.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Germane Crowell caught a 45-yard touchdown pass in
the first quarter, and the Lions scored twice within a minute late
in the second quarter. After Greg Hill's 29-yard touchdown run, the
Bears turned the ball over on their next play. Three plays later
Johnnie Morton caught a 2-yard touchdown pass and just like that,
the Lions had a 21-0 lead. The Bears scored just before halftime on
Jim Miller's 3-yard pass to Alonzo Mayes.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, Chicago began to get inside Detroit's
head. The Bears changed up their defense, mixing coverages in the
secondary and sending blitzes at Frerotte that seemed to surprise
him. Frerotte, not knowing where the pressure was coming from,
occasionally did not see receivers who were wide open.
</P>
<P>
   As Frerotte cooled, Miller heated up, and he took advantage of a
secondary that was missing Carrier and cornerback Bryant Westbrook,
out with an injured hamstring. Miller moved the Bears into position
for Chris Boniol's 27-yard field goal in the third quarter, cutting
the lead to 21-10. In the fourth quarter Miller, working mostly
from the shotgun, took Chicago 49 yards in five plays, finishing
the drive with a 23-yard touchdown pass to Marty Booker.
</P>
<P>
   But Chicago missed a crucial opportunity after it had stopped
the Lions' offense. The Bears had the ball at their own 15-yard
line with 6 minutes 34 seconds left in the game. That was the time
to make a move. Instead, Chicago had three unsuccessful pass
attempts and punted.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit then converted a third-and-11, a third-and-5 and a
third-and-10, allowing the Lions to run out the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who completed 25 of 37 passes for 204 yards, performed
bravely for the Bears. He was beaten up all afternoon and in the
third quarter was hit on his right knee, causing him to limp
noticeably for the rest of the game.
</P>
<P>
   He might have been motivated by how the Lions treated him.
Miller, who grew up in Waterford, Mich., a 10-minute drive from the
Silverdome, was cut by the Lions in training camp last year. Miller
felt he never got a fair shot and this week talked about getting
revenge. He will have to wait for another chance.  &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ If all goes as planned, a woman who has campaigned
time and again in Harlem for political office will soon do so
again. But this time, Lenora Fulani, two-time presidential
candidate, former standard-bearer of the now-defunct New Alliance
Party, and perpetual thorn in the Democratic Party's side, will
have company.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fulani, long known as a far-left espouser of
Marxist-Leninist politics, has promised to help Pat Buchanan, a
Reaganite and Cold Warrior known for his far-right politics, in his
quest for the Reform Party nomination for president. In endorsing
him earlier this month, she promised to take him to Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction of Rep. Charles Rangel, whose district includes
Harlem, was typical. ``Only in America,'' he said. ``I just wish I
had been the fly on the wall when they made that alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agrees the alliance is unusual; some would call it
unholy. Either way, Ms. Fulani, one of the more colorful, perennial
figures in New York politics, has once again formed a relationship
that allows her to keep a toehold in American politics.
</P>
<P>
   By working within the Reform Party, where Ms. Fulani has a
significant base of support and is its most prominent black member,
she may be on the verge of gaining a national foothold for the
first time _ much to the dismay of her critics, who are legion. Ms.
Fulani and her close associate, New Alliance Party founder Fred
Newman, have been accused repeatedly of anti-Semitism, entwining
group therapy and politics in a cult-like way, and of enriching
personal enterprises through public monies in the form of federal
election funds.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Roger Stone, the director of the presidential exploratory
committee of Donald Trump, a potential Reform Party rival of
Buchanan, wasted no time calling Ms. Fulani a ``con artist'' and a
``huckster.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Trump's recent criticism of Fidel Castro, Stone
said: ``We find it ironic that on the same day Donald Trump was in
Miami condemning a Marxist, Pat Buchanan was climbing into bed with
one.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Fulani and Buchanan have tried to stress their common
economic populism, and particularly their antipathy for free trade,
neither has made a real attempt to pretend they had, or would,
reach agreement on the issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and I have never had an issue-oriented dialogue, because
there's nothing to talk about,'' Ms. Fulani said.
</P>
<P>
   Newman, who has been Ms. Fulani's political Pygmalion, shaping
her career, her image, her decisions, said: ``He has positions that
are antithetical to everything Fulani has said for years and
everything I have stood for for years. Some of his rhetoric on
immigration I find repulsive _ I can use no other word.''
</P>
<P>
   What brought Buchanan and Ms. Fulani together, they said at a
news conference, was the banner that Ms. Fulani has carried since
the early 1980s, and that Buchanan has suddenly hoisted: breaking
the ``iron grip'' of the two-party system on American politics.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fulani's driving issues are things like same-day voter
registration, which she believes could give independent parties a
fairer shot at the polls. She has arrived at a politics about
process, bleached, for the time being, of issues and ideology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Issue politics were not given to us by Moses,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   How much minority support Ms. Fulani can deliver is hard to
gauge. Where she can help Buchanan is in complying with Reform
Party rules that require him to gain enough signatures to qualify
for the ballot in the 29 states _ and the District of Columbia _
where the party does not have an automatic slot.
</P>
<P>
   It is a daunting task, requiring 700,000 to 800,000 signatures
in total. Buchanan has said he does not have the personnel to do
it. Ms. Fulani _ who collected 1.5 million signatures to get on the
ballots in 1988 _ has both the foot soldiers and expertise (she has
waged numerous court battles over ballot access).
</P>
<P>
   In return, she gets, if not legitimacy, publicity. Eleven years
ago, this self-described ``poor black woman from Chester, Pa.''
waged a largely unheralded candidacy for president of the United
States. She managed to get on the ballot in all 50 states, the
first woman and the first black to do so, and received more than
200,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
   The process was exhilarating to her; the lack of recognition _
by the media and political establishment _ embittering. So Ms.
Fulani's endorsement of Buchanan seemed as much about drawing the
spotlight to her as bolstering his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It worked. The endorsement quickly became grist for the talk
show mill. It provoked agitated commentary everywhere from the Rush
Limbaugh show to callers on WLIB. Ms. Fulani, on the margins for
her entire political career, was suddenly in an eddy of the
mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's now getting media attention she's never gotten and she
can speak for these issues,'' Newman said, referring to her
political reform agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Newman and Ms. Fulani are also banking that Buchanan can earn
enough votes to ensure that the Reform Party retains its federal
matching funds.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The cost has been some blistering criticism. ``I know politics
makes strange bedfellows, but there has to be principles involved,
and there are no principles here,'' said Michael Hardy, a former
Fulani associate _ and admirer _ who serves as the lawyer for the
Rev. Al Sharpton. ``This is worse than Hitler-Stalin: this destroys
a movement,'' he said, referring to the third-party politics'
potential to empower African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the endorsement is more likely to hurt Buchanan, who
does have a core of committed supporters, than Ms. Fulani, who for
all her talk about broadening American democracy has often been
most effective marshaling a committed cadre within a political
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fulani and myself have such little credibility that there's
not that much to lose,'' Newman said.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, much to gain: along with a national stage,
real power in New York politics _ and specifically, next year's
Senate race. Over the past five years, Ms. Fulani and her
supporters have gradually gained power in the state's Independence
Party, which won 364,000 votes in last year's gubernatorial race
with B. Thomas Golisano as its candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The party now has the third line on the ballot; who it lends
that line to in the Senate race could be crucial in a close
election. (In New York state, the Independence Party is the Reform
Party's outlet.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fulani is part of a ``Democracy Coalition'' that is trying
to unseat the current chairman, Jack Essenberg, along with
two-thirds of the party's executive committee, on charges of
``disloyalty and corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fulani group has basically infiltrated the party and wants
to take it over and control it,'' Essenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fulani responded by saying: ``It's a democracy war. It's
magnificent.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Laureen Oliver, the party co-founder and the leader of the
Democracy Coalition, said that she has worked with Ms. Fulani
because so far, she has done nothing to betray non-centrist
leanings. ``She has not made any extreme leftist statements since
she's been in the party,'' Ms. Oliver said. ``Lenora's what you
call `blending' now. She's blending into the party.''
</P>
<P>
   If she blends effectively enough, it could lead to this
improbable scenario: Rudolph Giuliani and Hillary Rodham Clinton
both having to court Ms. Fulani's support to win the Independence
Party's backing.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is also possible that neither candidate will pass
muster, and Ms. Fulani herself will run. She is coy about the
prospect, but does not deny that it is a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   She has already run for mayor, governor, lieutenant governor,
and president, attracting columns of controversy along the way. She
has embraced Moammar Gadhafi and Louis Farrakhan, and heckled Bill
Clinton. She and Newman have made statements that have been
denounced as anti-Semitic by Jewish groups like the Anti-Defamation
League, even as they have repeatedly repudiated anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   The New Alliance Party, which was disbanded when Newman and Ms.
Fulani joined forces first with the Patriot Party, then the Reform
Party, was also criticized for its close links to Newman's
extensive ``social therapy'' practice. The practice operated on the
premise that political activism could help overcome emotional
problems, and numerous therapy recipients also went into party
work.
</P>
<P>
   Newman also heads a complex constellation of businesses and
nonprofit organizations, including a theater and publishing house,
some of which benefited from the federal matching funds Ms.
Fulani's 1992 presidential campaign earned. The funds went to
different Newman and New Alliance Party enterprises for services
like consulting and advertising, to buy _ at an elevated rate _
copies of the party newspaper, to rent office space from the party,
and so on. The Federal Election Commission ordered the party to
repay the government $117,000 for not doing arms-length
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fulani and Newman say (and congressman Rangel, for one,
agrees) that their practices were no different from the Democratic
Party's, which they said also gives business and contracts to
patrons and supporters. She has accused the Democratic Party of
``postmodern political apartheid.'' Black leaders, she says, have
sold out by insisting on support for a party that has repeatedly
ignored black interests.
</P>
<P>
   But even those who agree with that assessment wonder if Buchanan
is the answer. Ms. Fulani's flirtation with him dates back at least
to 1996, when she wrote that, like Ross Perot and Farrakhan, he had
been demonized by the media: ``He has tapped into the
anti-government, anti-big-business, pro-people sentiments of a
significant portion of the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Pat Choate, former vice presidential candidate for the
Reform Party, and currently Buchanan's campaign co-chairman, who
brought them together. Now Ms. Fulani is forging ahead with her
plan to bring Buchanan to Harlem, and specifically to the National
Action Network, the headquarters of her erstwhile ally, the Rev. Al
Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
   The two worked closely together in the late 1980s and early
1990s, when ``Rev.,'' as she calls him, was just venturing into
electoral politics. They marched together in Howard Beach and
Bensonhurst and worked on the Tawana Brawley case.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Fulani says she felt betrayed when Sharpton ran for
Senate as a Democrat in 1992, rather than under the New Alliance
Party, after she had collected tens of thousands of signatures to
help get him on the ballot. The break, she said, affected their
friendship. Sharpton now plays down that friendship, saying they
were never as close as the media projected.
</P>
<P>
   He has yet to hear an explanation of the endorsement, he said.
``Their concern is how do you build another party,'' he said of Ms.
Fulani and her allies. ``My view is, if the issues aren't more
important than the party, then what are we in it for?''

INJURY FORCES RETIREMENT OF THE SPEED KING ARTAX 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the morning he was scheduled to enter Saturday's Cigar Mile
for a final shot at winning the title Horse of the Year, the
sprinter Artax was suddenly retired Thursday after he was found to
have torn the suspensory ligament in his left foreleg.
</P>
<P>
   A 4-year-old son of Marquetry who set three speed records this
year and won the Breeders' Cup Sprint three weeks ago, Artax was
poised to enter the race as the favorite. But his trainer, Louis
Albertrani, said he discovered a small lesion in the upper part of
the suspensory ligament after the colt seemed out of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   The injury provided another dramatic example of the cruel
fortunes of racing. Artax joins a long list of star-crossed horses
that includes A.P. Indy, who was scratched from the Kentucky Derby
on the morning of the race in 1992 with a foot injury, and
Charismatic, who won the Derby and the Preakness this year and then
finished third in the Belmont Stakes after fracturing his left
foreleg in two places in the homestretch.
</P>
<P>
   Both Albertrani and Ernie Paragallo, the owner of Artax, have
been discounting the notion that they were running their horse in
the Cigar Mile simply to clinch Horse of the Year. But they
acknowledged that winning the stakes race could not hurt his
chances. Now, two days before the race, they were left with a star
horse who had run for the last time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame, but he is retired,'' Albertrani said Thursday
morning at his barn at Belmont Park in New York. ``But he did his
job for us, and really had a great year.''
</P>
<P>
   Artax probably tore the ligament during a fast workout Tuesday
morning when he flew half a mile in 45 4/5 seconds. Five days
earlier, he raised some concern when he worked a slow mile in 1:44
3/5. But Albertrani attributed the slow work to the fact that he
had changed the horse's routine and tried to rate him, or get him
to conserve his speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all of my horses, I jog them the day after they breeze,''
Albertrani said. ``After he jogged Wednesday, we noticed he was
off. We checked him out, and that's when we discovered a small
lesion in the upper part of the suspensory.''
</P>
<P>
   Paragallo, who endured a series of misfortunes with Unbridled's
Song two years ago, said he had no control over Horse of the Year,
which is left to a complex vote by racing writers and officials.
But he extolled his horse's success even while lamenting his fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Artax had a phenomenal year,'' Paragallo said. ``He broke or
tied three track records, and I don't know any horse that did that.
He won three Grade I races.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strange thing was that, when we first saw that he was off,
we thought it was his foot. So, we called in a bunch of
veterinarians and the hoof specialist Ian McKinlay. When we
couldn't find anything, we X-rayed him up and down. When that
showed nothing, we scanned him up and down. That's when we found
the suspensory injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Paragallo said he still was not sure the ligament was causing
the problem, ``but I'm not going to take any chances with Artax.''
He said Artax would stand as a stallion in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Paragallo entered another of his horses, the
3-year-old Adonis, in the Cigar Mile. It will be run for a purse of
$350,000 with a field of nine. Adonis won the Wood Memorial last
April but proved a disappointment in the Triple Crown races. Also,
Affirmed Success became a late entry when Artax became a late
dropout and even inherited Artax's jockey, Jorge Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   Artax won only four of his 15 starts this year, and he was a
sprinting specialist, which meant that he had two strikes on him in
the voting for Horse of the Year. But no horse rose above the herd
as the logical candidate for Horse of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Behrens lost his final three races and ran poorly in the
Breeders' Cup Classic. Victory Gallop was retired with a leg
injury. Charismatic, after winning the Kentucky Derby and the
Preakness, was retired after his misfortune in the Belmont Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   But Artax became one of the year's dramatic stars because of his
speed.
</P>
<P>
   In May in the Carter at Aqueduct, he broke Dr. Fager's track
record by sprinting seven furlongs in 1:20. In October in the
Forest Hills Handicap at Belmont Park, he broke Groovy's track
record by dashing six furlongs in 1:07 3/5. And in November at
Gulfstream Park in the Breeders' Cup Sprint, he tied Prospector's
track record and broke the Breeders' Cup record for the race by
flying six furlongs in 1:07 3/5.

GEORGE STINSON, 84, TAX LAWYER AND STEEL CEO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., N.C., Ind., Ark., Ga., Md.)  (lb) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   George Arthur Stinson, who managed two highly successful careers
as a tax lawyer on Wall Street and as a steel magnate in
Pittsburgh, died on Nov. 19 at his home in Tryon, N.C., where he
had retired in 1983. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Stinson spent the 1950s as a partner dealing with tax laws in
what is now Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen &AMP; Hamilton, a prominent
international law firm based in New York. In 1961, at age 46, he
abruptly changed course to become secretary and a vice president
with National Steel Corp. in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   He rose rapidly, becoming president in 1963 and chief executive
the next year. He held the chief executive post until 1980,
concurrently serving as chairman from 1972 to 1981 and helping to
diversify the company.
</P>
<P>
   National Steel, the United States' fourth-largest producer of
steel, became a subsidiary of the Japanese steelmaker NKK in the
early 1980s, and its headquarters now is in Mishawaka, Ind. Stinson
remained a board member of National Steel until 1986.
</P>
<P>
   George Stinson was born in Camden, Ark., and graduated Phi Beta
Kappa from Northwestern University in 1936. He earned an LLD degree
at Columbia University Law School in 1939 and was admitted to the
New York bar that year.
</P>
<P>
   In World War II he rose to lieutenant colonel as an intelligence
officer in the Army Air Forces and was decorated with the Legion of
Merit. After the war he joined the U.S. attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   He was an assistant attorney general in the tax division when he
was recruited by the Wall Street law firm, which made him a partner
in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   He was a past chairman of the American Iron and Steel Institute
and the International Iron and Steel Institute, and a director of
Mutual Life Insurance Co. and Ralston-Purina Co. He was a trustee
of the University of Pittsburgh and the George C. Marshall
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976 he served President Gerald Ford as national chairman of
the Bicentennial Savings Bond Drive. Just before that he sat on the
Presidential Commission on International Trade and Investment
Policy.
</P>
<P>
   Stinson is survived by his wife of 52 years, Betty Millsop
Stinson; three sons, Thomas of Atlanta, Peter of Pittsburgh and
Joel of Tryon; a daughter, Lauretta Stinson-Williams, of Bethesda,
Md.; and eight grandchildren.

NYC COLUMN: MENTALLY ILL AND ADRIFT ON STREETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Breathes the New Yorker whose thoughts and prayers
are not with Nicole Barrett this holiday season?
</P>
<P>
   But let's be honest with ourselves. One reason her plight stirs
us is that it pushes every ``there but for the grace of God go I''
button. Any of us could have been walking in midtown Manhattan and
suddenly had life turned upside down, as hers was last week when
she was smashed in the head with a brick.
</P>
<P>
   There is a group of New Yorkers _ not a large one _ who can also
put themselves in the shoes of Ms. Barrett's attacker. While
nothing is publicly known about this fellow, everyone seems to be
working on the theory that he is homeless and mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   Eugenia Burgess has been there. She has been on the street, on
drugs and, she acknowledges, not 100 percent in the head. She has
also been the victim and perpetrator of terrible violence. ``When I
heard voices,'' said Ms. Burgess, 42, ``they'd tell me to do things
so bad, they'd frighten me.''
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Fonville, only 20, has been there, too. It would not
surprise him if the brick-wielder was trapped in the same mental
labyrinth. ``Maybe somebody did something to him, or a girl
disrespected him,'' Fonville said. And while not excusing the man's
violence, Michele Nesbitt, 37, suggested that ``maybe it was
because he wasn't getting proper treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   That much seemed a safe bet to her and other former homeless
people who are living these days in Queens residences run by
Phoenix House, the drug-treatment center. Eight of them got
together the other day to talk about life on the street and the
long, uncertain road out of it.
</P>
<P>
   They formed a quorum of misery, these troubled souls with their
criminal records, histories of violence, addictions to a laundry
list of drugs and assorted mental problems: bipolar disorder,
voices in the head, severe depression, you name it. They are, or
were, the kinds of people the rest of us step around when we see
them on the street, or pretend do not exist by burying our heads in
the newspaper when they stumble into the subway car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people consider us normal,'' said Jeanine
Matteo, 31. ``They look down on us. Nobody would ever reach out to
people like us to say, `Do you need help?'''
</P>
<P>
   Her Phoenix House roommate gave only her first name, Kelly,
because she did not want to embarrass her family on Long Island.
Kelly is 21. She has done a lot of living in those few years, not
much of it good, certainly not the part when she was strung out and
homeless in Tompkins Square Park in the East Village. She had come
mentally unhinged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voices told me to rob people,'' Kelly said. ``I looked at
people not as people, just purses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We get looked at like we're bad people who do sick things,''
she said. ``But in treatment you realize that we're sick people who
do bad things.''
</P>
<P>
   David Muse, 36, recalled how it used to be. ``I get these
outbursts when I get so very emotional, my chest rises up, '' he
said. ``But I've had proper medication for four or five months. It
balances me out.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly picked up on his point. ``If a person has diabetes, he has
a chemical imbalance, and you give him insulin,'' she said. ``But
if a person's mentally ill or addicted to drugs, he's got a
chemical imbalance, too. But they throw him in jail. What happens
if you put a diabetic in jail without treatment? He dies. And what
happens to us? Well, we wither and die.''
</P>
<P>
   Treatment, they all agreed, is the underplayed component in the
Giuliani administration's latest roundup of street people, which to
them suggests not so much a thought-out policy as a knee-jerk
reaction to lurid tabloid headlines after the assault on Ms.
Barrett.
</P>
<P>
   Even the mayor acknowledged last week that neither the city nor
the state has come up with enough money for programs needed by the
mentally ill homeless. But the focus for now is on the area of
governance he is most comfortable with: law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   That approach alone will lead to failure, predicted Joan Jones,
49. ``There's more drugs in jail than on the street,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Ms. Jones added, homeless people themselves have to
want to get a grip. Francisco Harkless, 29, said that he finally
decided to enter a treatment program early this year because ``I
got tired of getting high, and I knew it was time to give it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Burgess simply ``got sick and tired of being sick and
tired.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel pretty lucky that I'm here to tell the story,'' she
said. ``God must've been looking over me, because with the things
that I did, I should be dead.''

SOME NEW YORKERS FEAR Y2K-RELATED WATER SHORTAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TINA KELLEY   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If there's been one constant to life in this city,
it's that water from upstate reservoirs will always flow from the
tap. But now, with the Year 2000 approaching, a few New Yorkers are
not so sure, and they've started stocking up _ just in case.
</P>
<P>
   One skeptic is Steve Molloy, 28, of Bayside, Queens, who pitched
in with four friends to buy a $10,000 trailer full of Glaceau
bottled water, about 250 cases each. He is storing his stash in his
garage, and he figures he will go through his supply of 3,000
bottles in a year or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not paranoid about it like other people are. I'm concerned
about the water supply, and it never hurts to be cautious,'' said
Molloy, who works in car sales. He is also stocking up on canned
soup and food.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully everything will be all right,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The concern over the water supply is one early indicator of how
people are already beginning to get ready for Y2K. Even some
government officials have said that people might want to stock up
on certain supplies _ much like they would for a natural disaster _
before the New Year, because computer glitches could hamper
distribution systems.
</P>
<P>
   But in terms of the water supply, city officials are confident
that they are prepared for the Year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The systems are almost exclusively gravity-fed and operate
with minimal mechanical assistance,'' said a statement on the city
Department of Environmental Protection's Web site. ``Department
staff can override these systems in the event of any problem, and
no service interruption is anticipated as a result of Year 2000
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some people are going out of their way to play it safe.
</P>
<P>
   At Ace Pump Corp., there is a six-week wait for gravity-operated
water filters. A spokesman said customers who had purchased baby
pools or large garbage cans to store water wanted filters to keep
it from tasting stale.
</P>
<P>
   Sensible Solutions 2000, which provides emergency backup water
systems to corporate clients, particularly in the financial
district, has experienced an increase in business also. Sensible
president Joseph Santos is having trouble finding drivers willing
to stand by to deliver 5,000-gallon water tanks. ``Drivers want to
spend Y2K with their families,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of possible commercial traffic restrictions around New
Year's Eve, deliveries may have to begin Dec. 30 and end Jan. 1,
with a driver on duty the entire time, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many water suppliers said they had not had an increase in
business yet. But some said that it was apparent that institutions
were concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Downing, the branch manager for Culligan, Long Island,
which provides bottled water for Brooklyn and Queens, as well as
Nassau and Suffolk Counties, said his company had received orders
from nursing homes that do not usually stock a lot of water, and
from New York state, which ordered 300 five-gallon bottles for two
detention centers.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Better Waters Inc., a Manhattan-based company
that sells water purification systems to restaurants, corporations,
hospitals and residences, said it had received calls from churches
looking for purification systems that do not require electricity.

EDITORIAL: THE MICROSOFT REFEREE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Nov. 26:
</P>
<P>
   Neither Microsoft nor the Justice Department appears ready to
negotiate an out-of-court settlement of the government's antitrust
charges. But Thomas Penfield Jackson, the trial judge whose initial
ruling three weeks ago labeled Microsoft a bullying monopolist,
wants a quick settlement anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Last week he made an artful move to get one, appointing one of
the country's leading antitrust experts, Richard Posner, a federal
appeals court judge, to serve as mediator for renewed settlement
talks. Posner has a rare qualification. He strikes fear in the
hearts of both sides of this epic battle _ enough fear, perhaps, to
compel them to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Posner is an intellectual leader of a conservative brand of
jurisprudence associated with the University of Chicago. Justice
officials will note with some alarm that his writings on antitrust
caution against aggressive remedies, pointing out that
government-imposed breakups of monopolies often backfire. Posner's
credentials will also give him the credibility to warn government
negotiators that they risk defeat if they do not settle soon. Based
on Jackson's initial ruling, Microsoft is almost certain to lose
the first round. It will then appeal. The appeals court includes
prominent conservative justices who, Posner can explain, may be
more hostile to the government's case than Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   William Kovacic, an antitrust expert at the George Washington
University Law School, predicts that Posner will also point out to
government negotiators that there is a gray area in Jackson's
initial ruling. The judge found that Microsoft's licenses with
equipment manufacturers and Internet companies went too far in
shutting competitors out of important markets. But he did not
define the boundary between acceptable and unacceptable contracts,
and Posner may well warn the government lawyers that they risk
losing everything if the appeals court decides that Jackson's final
ruling draws the line in the wrong place.
</P>
<P>
   Posner will also make Microsoft squirm. He is regarded as a
jurist who interprets the law as it is, not as he would have
written it himself. He can point to cases where he has argued
forcefully, as have many other conservative judges, that appeals
courts should give deference to the findings of regulatory agencies
and trial judges. He will warn Microsoft that Jackson's finding of
facts will not be easily overturned by the conservatives on the
appeals court and that Microsoft bears an enormous risk by refusing
to settle now.
</P>
<P>
   There are other pressures at play. Jackson cited possible
divisions between the state attorneys general and the Justice
Department as a reason for asking Posner to mediate the dispute. If
state and federal officials demand different remedies, the case
could be tied up in legal tangles for years. Posner may wield
enough clout to bring the state officials in line with federal
antitrust officials.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also faces private lawsuits. The typical consumer has
little to gain from suing Microsoft. But spread across millions of
consumers, the amount at risk in a class-action suit provides a
potential bonanza for lawyers and a nightmare for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts argue that the threat of private lawsuits provides
no incentive for Microsoft to settle now because Jackson's initial
finding _ that Microsoft acted as an abusive monopolist _ is
already public and provides sufficient legal ammunition for private
plaintiffs to sue to recover damages for paying Microsoft
excessively high prices for its software. But Kovacic disagrees,
arguing that a settlement could in effect suppress Jackson's
initial ruling and strip private plaintiffs of most of its legal
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Posner's presence hardly guarantees a settlement. So far, there
is no obvious remedy that satisfies both sides. A seemingly modest
sanction, such as prohibiting Microsoft from writing contracts that
cut its competitors off from potential customers, would in fact
lead to immodest results _ perpetual judicial review of contracts
throughout the software industry.
</P>
<P>
   But relieving the government of continual oversight would
require a radical restructuring _ breaking up Microsoft, or forcing
it to license its operating system to other software companies so
they could modify and sell it on their own. Perhaps the odds of
finding a remedy acceptable to Microsoft and the government remain
low, but they are far higher with Posner than without him.

</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Nov. 26:
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has agreed to decide whether a Texas school
district violated the Constitution by letting students lead others
in prayer over the public address system before high school
football games. The practice plainly breaches the First Amendment's
wall of separation between church and state, and the justices
should not hesitate to say so.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found that the
school district's policy of using ``student surrogates to deliver
prayers before a captive audience'' was a deliberate attempt to
``circumvent'' the Supreme Court's principled but highly
controversial 1992 holding that public schools could not invite
members of the clergy to lead prayers at graduation ceremonies.
Written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, that thoughtful 5-4 decision
correctly recognized that ``prayer exercises in elementary and
secondary schools carry a particular risk of indirect coercion.''
It also recognized that students should not be made to feel like
outsiders by a religious observance that is not their own.
</P>
<P>
   In the Texas case, the fact that pregame prayers are led by
students rather than clergy does not lessen the pressure for
religious conformity. It may even increase it, given how
susceptible schoolchildren are to peer pressure and how seriously
Texans take football. Nor can the change in messengers mask the
school's role in organizing the religious worship, or transform the
occasion into a neutral public forum where all kinds of speech are
welcome. In reality, school officials maintained total control of
the program, the stated purpose of which was to ``solemnize'' the
occasion with prayer.
</P>
<P>
   The case could well resonate in the 2000 elections. Texas Gov.
George W. Bush, the front-running Republican presidential
candidate, signed the brief submitted by Texas and eight other
states urging the court to allow prayer at school sporting events.
Earlier this month the House weighed in with a similar resolution
calling on the court to allow it.
</P>
<P>
   For mysterious reasons, the court has agreed to review only that
part of the 5th Circuit ruling that correctly held student-led
prayers to be unconstitutional at school sporting events. The court
declined to take up the 5th Circuit's contradictory holding that
students may offer ``nonsectarian and nonproselytizing'' prayers at
graduation ceremonies because commencement exercises, unlike school
sporting events, are ``singularly serious'' in nature. That
appeared to clash with the Supreme Court's past ruling against
clergy offering graduation prayers, and left unclear just where the
line is drawn on school-sponsored prayer.
</P>
<P>
   To resolve the muddle, the Supreme Court must make clear that
the First Amendment's protection against state establishment of
religion does not depend on whether the event is a commencement or
a football game, or whether the person delivering the prayer
happens to be a student.

EDITORIAL: NIGERIA'S CLEAN BROOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Nov. 26:
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria is Africa's most populous country, and potentially one
of its most prosperous. But for decades, a deeply rooted culture of
corruption has undermined Nigeria's economy, impoverished its
people and tarnished its international reputation. It has also
helped make Nigeria one of the world's leading centers of drug
smuggling, including much of the narcotics that reach the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Now, under a new democratic government, there are encouraging
signs of change. If President Olusegun Obasanjo continues his
aggressive campaign against bribery, kickbacks and consumer scams,
Washington and other Western governments should reward his efforts
by rescheduling some of the debts Nigeria incurred under the
corrupt military regimes of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo came to office with a deserved reputation as a
reformer. In the 1970s, he headed the only military government in
Nigeria's history to freely hand power to an elected successor.
Later, under the harsh 1990s dictatorship of Gen. Sani Abacha, he
spent three years in prison for opposing government repression. But
few expected a serious attack on corruption or a serious
investigation into the abuses of his military predecessors.
Obasanjo's earlier government was known for diverting oil revenues
and demanding payments for licenses and contracts, and his election
campaign this year had been financed by Nigeria's military
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   But since taking office six months ago, Obasanjo has removed
hundreds of corrupt military officers and government officials and
brought legal claims against their business cronies that could
permit the recovery of billions of stolen dollars. Corruption still
plays too big a role in Nigerian political life, and Obasanjo has
shown a disturbing tendency to wink at illicit conduct by his
closest political allies. But the change in Nigeria's ethical
climate is pronounced.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria's oil and mineral wealth should disqualify it from
outright debt relief. But when Obasanjo visited Washington in
October, President Clinton endorsed stretching out payments on some
of Nigeria's $30 billion international debt as further reforms
unfold. The Clinton administration should wait until Obasanjo's
strong anti-corruption legislation overcomes parliamentary
resistance. Washington should also demand compliance with
international human rights standards in the oil-producing Niger
Delta region, where the repressive policies of previous military
governments are still in force.
</P>
<P>
   But once these conditions are met, America should help make
Nigeria a showcase for the proposition that an honest, democratic
government can bring a demonstrably better life to ordinary people.

</P>
<P>
   Aikman completed 9 of 10 passes for 163 yards in the second
half, including a 65-yard pass for a touchdown to Raghib Ismail.
Aikman did most of his damage in the fourth quarter, completing all
five pass attempts for 141 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``From an offensive standpoint, we knew it was going to be
awfully hard to move the ball 70 to 80 yards without making some
big plays,'' Aikman said. ``We needed to hopefully play good
defense and not have a high-scoring ballgame, and take shots when
we had them.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman spread the ball to nine receivers, only the third time he
has done that this season and the first time since hitting nine on
Oct. 24 against Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman recovered from a difficult first half. At halftime,
Aikman was only 7-of-19 for 69 yards. Only one pass went for more
than eight yards, a 35-yard completion to Jason Tucker.
\Nsubheds:Emmitt gets 100 Emmitt Smith notched his sixth 100-yard
game of the season and his third 100-yard outing in the past three
games he has played. Smith missed the Green Bay game two weeks ago
with a broken hand. Smith finished with 103 yards on 31 carries _
his most carries this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys became the fifth team in 11 games to rush for more
than 100 yards against the Dolphins, who entered the game allowing
91.9 yards rushing a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been saying this all season, the strength of this offense
lies with those five guys up front,'' said Smith, who has 978
rushing yards this season. ``If we use them and continue to mix up
the calls then we can continue making big plays.''
\Nsubheds:Cunningham connects Richie Cunningham kicked two
fourth-quarter field goals, from 36 and 23 yards, to go 2-for-2
yesterday, but coach Chan Gailey bypassed two 50-yard field-goal
opportunities in the first half. Cunningham's first field goal gave
the Cowboys a 10-0 lead early in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham has converted 10 of 19 (52 percent) after falling
below 50 percent last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt good with my approach and the way I hit the ball,''
Cunningham said. ``Any player wants the opportunity to go out and
play. If you don't you shouldn't be out there.'' \Nsubheds:Penalty
crunch Nine first-half penalties thwarted three promising Cowboys
drives and nearly led to a Miami touchdown. In all, Dallas was
penalized 13 times for 103 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys quashed two drives at the Miami 35 and 34 on
successive possessions. Penalties moved them out of field-goal
range each time, and they failed to convert on fourth-down plays
both times.
</P>
<P>
   A Deion Sanders interception of a Dan Marino pass in the end
zone ended a Miami drive to the Dallas 9, aided by two Cowboys
penalties for 20 yards. Ebenezer Ekuban kept the drive alive with a
15-yard roughing-the-quarterback penalty on third-and-11 from the
Miami 36. \Nsubheds:Right at home The Cowboys are at a loss to
explain why they are 5-0 at home and 1-5 on the road. They play at
New England next week and then have one road game remaining at New
Orleans on Dec. 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we go on the road,'' Deion Sanders said, ``you need to
pray for us.'' \Nsubheds:Briefly Raghib ``Rocket'' Ismail left the
game after suffering a ``mild concussion'' on a 7-yard catch on the
third play of the game. Chan Gailey said initially he didn't
believe Ismail would return. But Ismail did start the second half
and caught a 65-yard fourth-quarter touchdown pass from Troy Aikman
to seal the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Center Mark Stepnoski left the game late in the third quarter
with what is being termed a strained left calf. His status for next
week is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys had not been involved in a 0-0 game at halftime
since Oct. 30, 1988, against the Phoenix Cardinals. Coincidentally,
the Dolphins' last 0-0 tie at the half occurred on the same day
against Tampa Bay.

`MORE STUFFING' IS N.Y. MAYOR'S CRY OF THE DAY, AND IT WORKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, whose frequent refrain is
that the highest form of compassion is to help people work to help
themselves, briefly shed his tough-love armor Thursday and donned
an apron to help pack up Thanksgiving meals for homebound AIDS
patients.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Giuliani displayed a softer image for the holiday,
the Police Department continued to enforce the mayor's edict to
stop the homeless from sleeping on city streets, by arresting them
if they refused to accept shelter or move along.
</P>
<P>
   An additional 34 homeless people were arrested on various
charges on Wednesday, the police said, bringing to 101 the total
arrested since Giuliani announced the effort last Friday. The
initiative was prompted by the attack on Nicole Barrett, who was
hit in the head with a paving stone, possibly by a homeless man.
</P>
<P>
   After riding in the Thanksgiving Day parade on a float with New
York Yankees manager Joe Torre, Giuliani visited Ms. Barrett and
her family at Bellevue Hospital Center, where she remains in
serious condition as she recovers from brain surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani had started the day with a live television interview
and then arrived at 7:30 a.m. at the downtown Manhattan
headquarters of God's Love We Deliver, a social service
organization that provides about 1,100 meals a day to homebound
people with AIDS in New York City and in Hudson County, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, wearing an apron, plastic gloves and a baseball cap
imprinted with a heart and helping hand insignia, stood behind a
steel counter in the basement kitchen. He scooped stuffing into
small aluminum trays and passed them down the line, where other
workers added turkey, gravy and sweet potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   When the mound of stuffing in front of him ran low, Giuliani,
taking a cue from other workers in the kitchen, shouted,
``Stuffing. More stuffing'' and was immediately resupplied. But
while the organization appreciated the publicity surrounding the
mayor, some workers said they did not support him.
</P>
<P>
   After about 20 minutes packing food, Giuliani left to deliver a
meal and a holiday gift basket to a 48-year-old man with AIDS who
lives in a two-room apartment in a walk-up building on the Lower
East Side. Inside the apartment, Giuliani sat down to chat.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are you doing.'' he asked. The man, wearing a purple
T-shirt and a worn Yankees cap, replied, ``Not well, honestly. I
just got out of the hospital 10 days ago.''
</P>
<P>
   He also told the mayor that he believed the city was paying too
much for his subsidized apartment, and asked to be moved to public
housing closer to the hospital where he receives treatment.
Giuliani said he would try to help.
</P>
<P>
   At Police Headquarters on Thursday, Sgt. Rafael Andalia, a
department spokesman, said that officers made contact with 242
homeless people between 4 a.m. and midnight Wednesday. He said 37
were taken to shelters, 4 went to hospitals and 154 agreed to move
along. Sergeant Andalia said he did not expect the department to
have a tally of how many homeless people were arrested on
Thanksgiving until sometime today.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 34 arrested Wednesday, 13 were charged with misdemeanors,
said Andalia. An additional 13 homeless people were issued
summonses, he said. The Giuliani administration's initiative has
been criticized by advocates for the homeless and by civil
libertarians as cruel and unjustified.

A SHOT-BLOCKING TREE TAKES THE GARDEN COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Loren Woods was one tall tree at a college called
Wake Forest. From the bottoms of his feet to the top of his head he
measures 7 feet 1 inch, and he gets even loftier when he leaps and
waves his long limbs to block shots or intimidate opponents. But
Woods was not happy in two seasons at Wake Forest, and he was
willing to miss a year of competition to leave for another school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a problem with the coach,'' Woods said. ``I wasn't
fitting in the program how I thought I would. I really didn't have
a problem with the school. I loved the area.''
</P>
<P>
   He almost chose Seton Hall, but ended up at Arizona after
comparing the April weather in both places. ``If I had went to
Seton Hall in the summertime, it would have probably been an even
tougher decision,'' Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   Having served his idle year as a practice participant, Woods is
now the Wildcats' starting center. He and sophomore forward Michael
Wright will lead Arizona into the championship game of the
Preseason National Invitation Tournament on Friday night against
Kentucky at Madison Square Garden. The match of two teams called
the Wildcats was set up Wednesday night when Arizona defeated Notre
Dame by 76-60 and Kentucky held off Maryland by 61-58.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky and Arizona have met only four times. In the 1997 NCAA
championship game, Arizona defeated Kentucky by 84-79 in overtime.
Kentucky was the defending champion that year, and it won again in
1998. Since their 1997 title match, Arizona and Kentucky have met
just once, in the Maui tournament in November 1997, and that was an
89-74 victory for Arizona. One participant in those 1997 games was
Jamaal Magloire, the 6-10 senior center for Kentucky. He could be
matched against Woods on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamaal no doubt is a good center in the lane,'' Woods said.
``Kentucky is a great team, similar to us, an athletic team, with a
good big man down low and a no-nonsense defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Magloire concurred. ``It's going to be a fast-paced game,'' he
said. ``It's definitely going to be exciting for everyone to
watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Magloire and Woods played in the same all-star tournament when
they were in high school, but have never matched up head to head.
``He was a great player then,'' Magloire said. ``He's only improved
since then. It's going to be a tough game.''
</P>
<P>
   Against the Irish on Wednesday, Woods scored 13 points, gathered
10 rebounds and blocked seven shots. It may have been a sample of
what is to come. Asked after that game whether he was game sharp
following his idleness, Woods replied: ``Not yet. You'll see it
when I'm game sharp.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Arizona coach Lute Olson, it was Woods' best game
in his team's 3-0 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``By far,'' Olson said. ``Not only was he a shot-blocker and a
defensive intimidator, he broke their zone with great passes from
the high post.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not difficult to sense the happiness of Woods, who grew up
in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team is like my family,'' he said. ``We're all like
brothers. We just have fun out there. It's a more comfortable
program for me. A more laid-back style of play. This program's
letting me do all the things I want to do: run the floor and play
defense, my two strongest attributes. I pretty much can get the
ball wherever I want it.''
</P>
<P>
   In this environment, how good can Woods be?
</P>
<P>
   ``The sky's the limit,'' Olson said.
</P>
<P>
   Woods and Wright had to defend against Troy Murphy, Notre Dame's
impressive forward, who scored 22 points. Wright also scored 22
points. When the Irish tried to draw Woods away from the basket by
moving Murphy out for higher shots, Olson switched to a zone
defense. It is a strategy he may use more frequently this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody's going to try to take Loren outside, we're not
going to let them take him outside, with his abilities inside,''
Olson said. ``So we've been a 99.9 percent man-to-man team, but we
have worked on the zone for this year because we feel it will be an
effective change for us.''
</P>
<P>
   That formation pleases Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I float around in a zone,'' he said. ``That's perfect for me.
Any shot they put up on the backboard, if it's close to me, I'm
going to get it. If I'm two or three arm lengths away, I'm going to
get it.''
</P>
<P>
   These words suggest bravado, but Olson said this was not
necessarily the case with Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Loren, No. 1, needs confidence,'' Olson said. ``I think he's a
little too hard on himself. Every game that he has like this, he's
going to be more confident and his teammates will show more
confidence in him.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the tournament finale on national television in midtown
Manhattan, Woods said: ``Playing in the Garden is like every kid's
dream. Michael Jordan and all the pros play here. I was watching
the Knicks the other night and getting kind of nervous coming out
here. It's a great experience for us.''

FERGUSON'S SUSPENSION SENDS THE JETS SCRAMBLING AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ The Jets began scrambling Thursday to change
part of their game plan, their defensive alignments and their
special teams personnel in the wake of the suspension of nose
tackle Jason Ferguson.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson, described by coach Bill Parcells as his best and
strongest defensive lineman, learned after Wednesday's practice
that his appeal of a four-game suspension for violating the NFL's
steroid policy had been denied.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a domino effect,'' Parcells said of the way the Jets
rushed to make changes for Sunday's game against the Colts in
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   With 52 players, the Jets are a man short on this week's roster
because they had not brought in an experienced lineman. This is
part of a series of personnel crises on this team because of
injuries. Parcells chose his words carefully Thursday but there was
little doubt of his exasperation with the penalty, and its timing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through Wednesday's practice with Jason playing,'' the
coach said. ``Now we've got two days to change things.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the Jets also have known for months that Ferguson faced
the suspension if his appeal was denied. Ferguson apparently tested
positive for a banned substance, which includes a range of
steroids, over the summer. Several teammates said Thursday that
Ferguson had been taking over-the-counter weight-reducing medicine
that contained a banned substance.
</P>
<P>
   In Ferguson's place, Jason Wiltz, a fourth-round rookie, will
see action along with the veteran Ernie Logan. They will be part of
a defensive line that attempts to contain the American Conference's
leading rusher, Edgerrin James, and the top-rated passer, Peyton
Manning.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets had increasingly used a four-man line, instead of three
in recent weeks, to improve the pass rush. It has worked well as
the defense has permitted a total of only 36 points during the
three-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson's improved play in returning from a sprained right
ankle in the season's opener has been part of the surge. He missed
three games after the injury. He apparently had already tested
positive by the time of his injury.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to losing him on the line, Parcells said, Ferguson
was one of the club's best protectors on the field-goal kicking
unit, playing either right or left guard.
</P>
<P>
   According to an NFL official, a lengthy process unfolds after a
player and team are first notified following the results of the
random test. The process includes the right to a second test and an
appeal. Once the appeal is heard by Jeff Pash, the league's
executive vice president, then Pash, after consulting with
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, makes the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the suspension came as soon as the appeals process
ended. Ferguson will be eligible to return for the next-to-last
game of the season, against the Dolphins on Dec. 27. He is not
permitted at the Jets' training complex until that week.
(Coincidentally, on Tuesday, the little-used Giants safety Lyle
West received a four-game suspension for steroid use.)
</P>
<P>
   Parcells was asked if this was an innocent mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' he said. ``But it's a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells described Ferguson's reaction as ``very upset and
disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not unlike Ferguson's reaction in 1997 after he had
tested positive for marijuana at the scouting combine and saw his
draft status sink drastically. He had been highly regarded out of
the University of Georgia and had expected to go in an early round.
Instead, he was the last player the Jets chose in the 1997 draft, a
seventh-rounder.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, however, he has impressed Parcells on and off the
field. Still, this latest incident piled more misery on the coach.
Ferguson is the fourth starter who will miss significant time or
whose season is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm anesthetized by now,'' Parcells said. ``You just try to go
on and do what you can do.''

NYC POLICE DEPT. TAKING A HARDER LINE ON MISCONDUCT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The city Police Department, long criticized as too
lenient in punishing officers accused of misconduct, has toughened
its internal discipline system, prosecuting and convicting more
officers in departmental trials, department statistics show.
</P>
<P>
   To Police Commissioner Howard Safir, the jump in the number of
cases brought to trial and the conviction rate of the internal
disciplinary system are evidence of his department's expanded
effort to root out wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the new cases are a result of the department's
unwillingness to offer light plea agreements to officers for
violations of department procedure, officials said. The cases most
often include charges like assault, excessive force and sexual
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   But some critics charge that the prosecutions are only an
attempt to deflect federal prosecutors in Brooklyn who have come to
a preliminary conclusion that the department too often fails to
discipline officers accused of excessive force, and that those
failures have fostered a climate of brutality.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation opened after the torture of Abner Louima by
two officers in a Brooklyn station house in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Police union officials say the department's tougher line is
further trampling their members' rights in a system long criticized
by officers as a star chamber where even small infractions are
punished and the outcome can be manipulated by ranking officials.
</P>
<P>
   The internal hearing system, in which police employees can face
administrative proceedings for charges ranging from not wearing
white socks to murder, is known as the trial room. The trials are
actually held in wood-paneled courtrooms on the fourth floor of
headquarters at 1 Police Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Its administrative law judges are full-time Police Department
employees, who report to Rae Koshetz, the department's deputy
commissioner for trials. The final decision in trials rests with
the police commissioner, and punishments can range from loss of
vacation time to dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a criminal trial, where the standard is beyond a
reasonable doubt, an administrative proceeding follows a standard
of whether something is more likely than not to have occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The department tried slightly fewer than 100 officers each year
from 1990 to 1995, compared with an average of 149 officers since
Safir took over in 1996, department statistics show.
</P>
<P>
   The conviction rate between 1990 and 1995 was about 65 percent,
compared with 75 percent since 1996, officials said. Last year, the
department tried 172 officers and convicted 77 percent of them,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The increase has continued this year: the department tried 104
officers through October and convicted 76 percent, the statistics
show.
</P>
<P>
   But William Goodman, the president of the Center for
Constitutional Rights, a legal advocacy group based in Manhattan,
said that the increase means little because the increase in cases
tried each year represents only a small fraction of the complaints
against officers that are substantiated.

IN NEW YORK, KOSOVAR REFUGEES OFFER THANKS FOR MANY REASONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SOMINI SENGUPTA  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The sprawling Kosovar Albanian clan of Erbelis and
Devas celebrated their first Thanksgiving together Thursday. The
hostess, Lili Erbeli, raised her glass of merlot in a toast to the
three dozen cousins squeezed around her dining room table, three
generations of Albanian-Americans with three generations of their
refugee kin. ``Happy Thanksgiving everybody,'' she said. ``Welcome
to my house.''
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, the gathering inside Lili and Rex Erbeli's
modest Sheepshead Bay duplex looked a lot like the unusual family
reunion they had over a late-night meal more than six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   On that night, in May of this year, 14 of the Erbelis' relatives
had arrived in New York, disheveled and disoriented refugees from
Mitrovica, one of Kosovo's most embattled cities. They ate chicken
cutlets almost wordlessly. None of the cousins, from here or there,
seemed eager to say much about the terror back home.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday night, many things had changed. The faces of the
Devas were decidedly less gaunt. The youngest of the refugees were
chattering in English. And Lili Erbeli's dining room was even more
crowded. Four other refugee cousins had arrived since the original
batch, which consisted of Lili's sister, Sytkije Deva, and her
husband, Musa, 72, their three grown children and their spouses,
and six grandchildren, ages 11 to 2.
</P>
<P>
   Four turkeys had been cooked, and the trimmings were as eclectic
as those at any immigrant family's Thanksgiving: There were heaps
of stuffed grape leaves alongside sweet potatoes, a giant tray of
Lili's famous custard as well and a pumpkin pie prepared by her
daughter, Ariana. The dining room table was joined with the kitchen
table, but dinner still had to be served in two shifts of 17. A
giant pot of egg noodles sat on the kitchen floor, for there was no
room anywhere else. The family cat slunk around carefully, with
scarce room to move about.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone could be there. The Erbelis' eldest daughter,
Betsy, had six of her husband's refugee kin at her house. Rex had
suggested she bring them along, but then, he joked, they would
probably spill out of the balcony.
</P>
<P>
   The second of three daughters, Albana, 26, couldn't be there,
either. She was spending Thanksgiving as an interpreter with the
U.S. Army at Camp Bondsteel, the U.S. military installation in
Kosovo where President Clinton and his daughter, Chelsea, stopped
off for a pre-Thanksgiving meal earlier this week.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was Lili's first Thanksgiving without Albana. ``Don't mention
it,'' is all she would say. She looked as though she would cry.
</P>
<P>
   For the newcomers, their first American Thanksgiving became an
occasion to reflect on their life here so far. While they once all
slept in the Erbelis' three-bedroom apartment, now they had
apartments of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Each in their own way, they debated still whether to stay here.
The eldest of the Deva siblings, Bujar, 38, and his wife, Yelldez,
36, were still the most reluctant to imagine a future here. After
nearly six months without work, Yelldez, who had been studying back
home to be a doctor, has recently been hired at a department store.
Looking ahead, she is also taking classes to be a medical
assistant. She is learning English by helping her boys _ ages 11
and 7 _ with their homework.
</P>
<P>
   The news from Mitrovica is dismal. Yelldez heard from her mother
that the electricity had been out for 13 days, that food prices
were absurdly steep and that hepatitis was rampant.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, a relative sent a picture of the Deva family
house, which had been burned to the ground. Mensur, 32, the second
of the Deva siblings, said he was prepared for it. He and his
brother and sister learned the news shortly after they fled their
home and landed in a Macedonian refugee camp. They didn't tell
their parents until recently. Seeing the picture of the house,
Mensur said, was hardest on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty-two years they lived there,'' he said. ``I was the
first child born there. They built it with their own hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Mensur, who now works for an Albanian-American construction
company, said he hasn't entirely given up hopes of reclaiming the
family property. But it is impossible to think about doing anything
now. Mitrovica is occupied by French peacekeeping forces. Tensions
between Serbs and Albanians _ the Deva house was in the Serb part
of town _ are as bad there as anywhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, Mensur and his siblings have found apartments in a
building in the Kings Highway neighborhood of Brooklyn, where
people of many nationalities and many faiths live together without
incident. His building, in fact, is packed with Russians. They
sided with the Serbs in their latest conflict with the Kosovars.
But there is no time to talk about such matters, he said, no time
to wonder where your neighbors are from, or what they might think
of you _ as he did back home.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, ``if your neighbor is a Serb, you must talk with them
differently, deal with them differently,'' he recalled. ``Here _
no.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, he said, they all miss being at home. But what is there to
go back to? ``What can you do? Wait for mercy, help?'' he asked.
``We have nowhere to work there. It's better to work here.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, he added, he thinks he will get lucky. Still searching for
the proper English expressions, Mensur likened life here to sailing
down a river, ``waiting for a chance.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A chance at what? Mensur shrugged, bounced his daughter, Bena,
2, in his arms. ``I going to make it,'' he said. ``I have a
feeling.''

IT'S TOUGH TO CRACK THIS DUBIOUS DOZEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ We've been sent reeling from so many black eyes
through the first 11 months of this year that the 1999 version of
the sports media Dubious Dozen doesn't even need to worry about
December.
</P>
<P>
   Congrats all around. We think.
</P>
<P>
   However, for unscrupulous behavior, hypocritical hijinks and
just downright stupidity, we hesitate to honor these 12 so close to
Thanksgiving because, well, it could get lumped into all those
other annual media Turkey Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Our list knocks the stuffing out of them anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Consider one that didn't make it: CBS studio analyst Marcus
Allen, at halftime of the AFC divisional playoff game, came up with
a scoop. He talked to Marty Schottenheimer, his former coach with
the Kansas City Chiefs, who confirmed that he would return as the
team's coach.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Schottenheimer resigned.
</P>
<P>
   For continuing to stop us in our tracks and make us re-evaluate
the boundaries of sports journalism, we give you:
</P>
<P>
   Samantha Stevenson
</P>
<P>
   The crime: Overall obnoxious behavior with a press credential.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen years ago, the freelance sportswriter who worked for
The New York Times and Playboy had a daughter, Alexandra, who grew
up to make the '99 Wimbledon semifinals. How sweet.
</P>
<P>
   Except that mom couldn't stop drawing attention to herself. She
made allegations about racism and lesbianism on the women's pro
circuit. She controlled her daughter's interview sessions _ often
taking them over herself.
</P>
<P>
   What blew her cover was when the Fort Lauderdale Times found
out, through a search of public records, that Alexandra's
birth-father was former NBA star Julius Erving, conceived through
an extra-marital affair in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   What was a sportswriter doing bedding down with a star athlete?
In Samantha Stevenson's mind, it was obvious _ it net her a super
kid.
</P>
<P>
   The aftermath: Mom and daughter began a media blitz of
interviews, starting with a Barbara Walters special.
</P>
<P>
   It came out that Stevenson did all kinds of unethical things as
a sportswriter in Philadelphia in the late '70s, enough to where
the Phillies players' wives had her barred from the team locker
room for hitting on their husbands.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder some male athletes fear females reporters in the
locker room. This sets sportswriting back to when hemlines seemed
more important than deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Gray
</P>
<P>
   The crime: During a live NBC interview for baseball's Team of
the Century in October, he tried to make Pete Rose come clean about
betting on baseball, but ended up badgering him into a needless
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Over a three-day period Gray managed to make Rose look like a
sympathetic character, made a pathetic character of himself when he
failed to apologize for ruining a moment, was made a fool by the
New York Yankees' Chad Curtis in a live postgame interview and
received little to no support from his journalistic brethren.
</P>
<P>
   The aftermath: Los Angeles News Group colleague Bob Keisser
revealed that Gray had been instructed by his boss, Dick Ebersol,
to go hard on the apology line of questioning and get Rose to
confess on the air. It was an out the spineless Gray didn't want to
take.
</P>
<P>
   Rose, meanwhile, comes out smelling like one. Last week, he
appeared (although we have yet to find any witnesses) on ``The
Martin Short Show'' and did a spoof of the Gray interview. Gray
hasn't been seen since the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   NBC Sports chief Dick Ebersol
</P>
<P>
   The crime: When he wasn't puppeteering Gray or telling the
president of John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance to ``shut up'' for
attacking sponsorship of the scandal-ridden IOC, Sir Dick was
acting noble for rehiring NBA play-by-play man Marv Albert about a
year after his scandalous sex life became public.
</P>
<P>
   The aftermath: Turner and Madison Square Garden Network took the
initial risk by hiring Albert for NBA games long before Ebersol
tested the public reaction. And when Fox made overtures during the
summer to hire Albert as an NFL play-by-play man, Ebersol admitted
he had to sign Albert for fear of losing him to the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Costas
</P>
<P>
   The crime: In the Oct. 16 issue of TV Guide, in a story
accompanied by a picture of him with this pathetic ``Why me?'' look
on his face, the NBC sportscaster whimpered that he doesn't
understand why people think of him as a pompous know-it-all on
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have tried to make valid points,'' said Costas.
``Unfortunately, the focus seems to be on me instead of the
validity of my statements.... I often have been portrayed as being
intractable.... It gets frustrating. It's not my intention to draw
attention to myself by being outspoken or contrary. Yet the mere
mention that something widely perceived as wonderful is not nearly
as wonderful as it may appear leaves me branded a crank.''
</P>
<P>
   Costas later tried to improve his image with a Sports
Illustrated story headlined ``Costas Unplugged,'' where, among
other things, he complained about athletes who expound their
religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   The aftermath: Forced us to look up the word ``intractable.'' It
fits.
</P>
<P>
   Dateline NBC
</P>
<P>
   The crime: During the Jan. 24 show, a bulletin flashed across
the bottom of the screen reporting that Joe DiMaggio had died.
Except he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   NBC explained the blunder: A staffer loaded that bulletin into
the graphic database so that when it did happen, NBC could
instantly report it.
</P>
<P>
   The aftermath: Stephen Brill, in his journalism watchdog
magazine Brill's Content, analyzed the big picture: ``It shows, I
think, the ultimate insular thinking.... they're keeping score in
the wrong game. Is cleverly loading up a headline in advance
announcing the inevitable really their idea of enterprise
journalism? Is somebody at NBC really going to go up to his boss
the next morning and get a big pat on the back when he announces
triumphantly that the `Yankee Clipper' died at 9:08 and we had it
on the air at 9:10?''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Glanville
</P>
<P>
   The crime: The Fox NFL analyst was sued in May by Minneapolis
Star Tribune reporter Paul Levy for running him over with a
motorcycle borrowed from the team mascot before a Vikings game the
previous November, injuring his arm and shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   When a replay was shown on TV during the game, Glanville said:
``What I did was ran into a sportswriter. I've been trying to kill
one of those guys for years.''
</P>
<P>
   The aftermath: As further jurisprudence is pending, Fox didn't
let the door hit Glanville on the back as his contract ran out. CBS
hired him.
</P>
<P>
   The Indy Racing League
</P>
<P>
   The crime: It tried to prevent Sports Illustrated from having a
credential to cover the Indianapolis 500 in late May, citing the
magazine's decision to run a photograph of the body of a victim of
an IRL crash in North Carolina earlier in the month.
</P>
<P>
   IRL chief Tony George also took shots at SI motor sports
reporter Ed Hinton, who had been critical of some of the
organization's moves. George called Hinton ``dangerous to himself
and the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   The aftermath: George is the real danger. When other newspapers
threatened to boycott coverage of the Indy 500, the issue was
magically resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN's X Games
</P>
<P>
   The crime: The highlight of the made-for-TV sporting event from
San Francisco last July wasn't even shown on TV. In the freestyle
motocross, 15-year-old Travis Pastrana went off the course and
jumped his bike into San Francisco Bay. And the judges awarded him
the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   The aftermath: ESPN officials said they didn't show it during
the tape-delayed coverage because it might encourage others to try
the same stunt.
</P>
<P>
   Just because we watch bungy jumping doesn't mean we're all going
to try it, OK?
</P>
<P>
   Mike Ditka
</P>
<P>
   The crime: The New Orleans Saints coach dressed in a tux and
posed with rookie running back Ricky Williams in a wedding dress on
a September cover of ESPN The Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The aftermath:About a month later, Ditka regretted doing it and
blamed ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are certain things you regret in life,'' Ditka
told the Akron Beacon Journal. ``You try to do people a favor and
they take advantage of you. I would say that ESPN took advantage of
Ricky and I (sic) in that situation. What goes around comes around;
I'm not going to buy anything from them.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee ``Hacksaw'' Hamilton (Still, not his real name)
</P>
<P>
   The crime: The USC football radio play-by-play hack left at
halftime of the USC-Oregon game on Sept. 25 from Eugene, Ore.,
because he needed to catch the first leg of a flight heading to
Pittsburgh, where the NFL's Seattle Seahawks played the next day.
Because the ego-maniac also does radio play-by-play for !ital!that
team.
</P>
<P>
   The aftermath: Could the school have been pleased having
sideline reporter Tim Ryan come up to the booth to stumble through
play-by-play of what turned out to be a three-overtime, 33-30 loss
to the Ducks? Juggle enough eggs in the air, and soon enough, one
will come down in your face.
</P>
<P>
   KTLA Channel 5
</P>
<P>
   The crime: The news director canned the well-respected and
long-time sports anchor (Ed Arnold) and hired the Latina (Claudia
Trejos) whose enunciation of the English language continues to
baffle not only viewers but those who hold positions in the
business.
</P>
<P>
   The aftermath: Critics were blown off by said news director as
being anti-female or anti-whatever-he-could-think-of to justify the
hiring. We're all just pro-get-it-right.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Times
</P>
<P>
   The crime: The mess created by sharing revenue with Staples
Center over the L.A. Times Magazine issue in October was more a
high-level blunder, although it dragged plenty of sportswriters
into it unknowingly.
</P>
<P>
   But here's one that happened right under their pica poles.
</P>
<P>
   In their Oct. 27 ``Hot Corner'' spot on page 2 of sports, which
is a regular feature labeled ``a consumer's guide to the best and
worst of sports media and merchandise,'' the book by the late Times
columnist Jim Murray called ``The Great Ones'' was reviewed by Mike
James.
</P>
<P>
   The review concluded: ``Savored a column or two at a time, this
book is a comfortable bedside companion. It's a fine gift, or
present to yourself. It is available in bookstores, or on the
Internet at (the Times' bookstore site) or by calling (an 800
number).''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere does it tell readers that James, a Times assistant
sports editor, is the book's editor and he wrote the introduction.
Maybe the thinking was that would make him the best qualified on
staff to review it in what is passed off as a non-revenue corner of
the page.
</P>
<P>
   The aftermath: It's a shame this looks as if they're trying to
squeeze every penny out of Murray's memory. &QL;

AN OUTSIDER LOOKS WISTFULLY FOR A BOWL BID 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's a personal ad worth circling:
</P>
<P>
   ``Road Warriors free for holidays. Southern team with 8-2
record. Enjoys travel _ played only three games at home. Loves
action _ brings nation's top-rated air attack led by second-most
productive passer in major college history. Flair for drama _ a
final-second touchdown pass by backup quarterback beat Alabama.
Solid references _ No. 6 in New York Times computer ranking, No. 25
in Associated Press poll. Seeks bowl game in Detroit. If interested
in having big fun and doing right thing, call Louisiana Tech Coach
Jack Bicknell III.''
</P>
<P>
   Why not try an ad? The Bulldogs have done everything else to
earn a spot in one of the 23 bowl games.
</P>
<P>
   They've cruised the country playing anyone anywhere this season
_ at top-ranked Florida State, at Alabama, and at Southern
California Friday evening in the Los Angeles Coliseum. They've won
eight straight after dropping the opener against the Seminoles and
losing their next game at home against No. 24 Texas A&AMP;M. But even
if Louisiana Tech crushes USC (5-6), there's a pretty good chance
the team will be home for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets pretty frustrating,'' said Bicknell, who is in his
first year as head coach at Louisiana Tech. ``Two years ago, we
went 9-2 and didn't go to a bowl game, and it really hurt the
program.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the Bulldogs are an independent and have no
conference tie-in with a bowl. In the cut-and-paste world of bowl
match-making, this means Wake Forest (6-5) will travel to Hawaii to
play the winner of Saturday's game between Arizona (6-5) and
Arizona State (5-5) because the Aloha Bowl promises to match the
No. 4 team in the Atlantic Coast Conference to No. 5 in the
dreadful Pacific 10 Conference if both teams have the minimum six
victories to be eligible for a bowl.
</P>
<P>
   That also means the country's best independent team might stay
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough,'' Louisiana Tech quarterback Tim Rattay said. ``We
beat Alabama at their place. There are teams with two, four, five
losses that we're better than, but the tie-ins aren't going our
way.''
</P>
<P>
   There is only one bowl invitation left for an at-large
invitation. A victory over Southern California Friday, combined
with a big performance by Rattay and a Pittsburgh loss at West
Virginia may be enough for Motor City Bowl organizers to invite
Louisiana Tech to Detroit. The Motor City Bowl, at the Pontiac's
Silverdome, is already locked in with the Mid-American Conference
champion, which is likely to be 10-0 Marshall. How about a matchup
between scoreboard-scorching teams with two of the best but least
publicized quarterbacks in the nation: Rattay and the Thundering
Herd's Chad Pennington?
</P>
<P>
   But first Rattay needs to get the Bulldogs past the Trojans. For
the third year in the row, he leads the nation in total offense
with 12,340 career yards. He trails only Brigham Young's Ty Detmer
on the career list and needs only 201 yards to overtake
Louisville's Chris Redman for second place.
</P>
<P>
   Will he do it? Bank on it. In 32 games, Rattay's career low is
239 yards against Auburn in 1998. In 26 games, Rattay, a senior,
has passed for 300 or more yards. In 11 of them he has passed for
more than 400 yards and, in seven others, surpassed 500 yards, an
unofficial National Collegiate Athletic Association record.
</P>
<P>
   Rattay, a 6-foot-1-inch native of Phoenix, played a year at
Scottsdale (Ariz.) Community College before he and Louisiana Tech,
in Ruston, got stuck with each other. His 28 junior college
touchdowns were impressive. His 21 interceptions weren't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just throwing,'' Rattay said. ``We'd catch it sometimes,
they'd catch it sometimes. Nobody wanted me except Louisiana Tech.
I didn't even know if they were a Division I school, but I didn't
have much choice _ either stay in junior college or go there.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to raise its program's profile, as well make money
(the trip to Florida State was worth $500,000), Louisiana Tech has
endured one of the most competitive road schedules in recent years.
The Bulldogs have beaten Alabama twice, Mississippi State and
Auburn. And Rattay has rung up big numbers against top-notch
opponents before hostile crowds. At Nebraska last season, he threw
for 590 yards in a a 56-27 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun to play in front of 80,000 people,'' said Rattay, who
this season has passed for 3,517 yards and 32 touchdowns, with only
nine interceptions. ``They may be booing you, but it's still 80,000
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bicknell, who played at Boston College and is the son of the
World Football League coach Jack Bicknell of the Barcelona Dragons,
intends to keep the Bulldogs on the road to challenge the best. On
the schedule for next season are Penn State, Miami and Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   In 2001, Louisiana Tech will join the Western Athletic
Conference, which has arrangements with bowl games in Las Vegas and
Mobile, Ala. It means definite opportunities for the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   But it will be a shame if Louisiana Tech and its 22 seniors are
left off the bowl roster this year, especially after earning the
first AP ranking in the school's history with an offense that
averages more than 470 yards a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like life; you never know when you've played the
last game,'' Rattay said.
</P>
<P>
   The Motor City organizers would do well to take a hard look at
the Bulldogs. You never know when you've found the team of your
dreams.

ERNEST SIGNORELLI, 75, REPUBLICAN WHO FOUGHT FOR SURROGATE'S POST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Fla., Calif.)  (lh) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ernest Leonard Signorelli, a maverick Republican who
served Suffolk County as a judge for 35 years before retiring as
its surrogate in 1995, died on Saturday at a nursing home in Center
Moriches, N.Y. He was 75 and most recently lived in Manorville,
N.Y., and St. Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   He had suffered a long illness, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   He won two terms as surrogate judge but had to battle his own
party for nominations to the bench. The post is considered the most
politically influential judgeship in the county.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Brooklyn, Signorelli graduated from New York University
and its law school in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   He began public service in Suffolk County in the mid-1950s as an
assistant district attorney and was elected to the Court of Special
Sessions in 1959 in the town of Babylon.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, then a district court judge, he won the county's first
contested Republican primary for county judge, defeating the
candidate preferred by the party regulars. The party formally
endorsed him for surrogate in 1975 after he warned it of another
primary fight.
</P>
<P>
   Yet his independent stance prompted the Republicans to deny him
renomination for a second 10-year term in 1985, and he had to fight
for it in the primaries that year.
</P>
<P>
   He won it and the general election and continued to serve until
he reached the mandatory retirement age of 70.
</P>
<P>
   Signorelli is survived by two daughters, Nancy Veni of
Sacramento, Calif., and Susan Signorelli of Riverhead, N.Y.; a son,
Richard E. of Manhattan and Westhampton Beach, N.Y.; a brother,
Joseph, of Manorville; a sister, Elvira Randone of Florida; and
three grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   His marriages to the former Louise D'Auge of Sacramento, and
Anita Signorelli of Quogue, N.Y., ended in divorce.

<P>
   Marketplace musings for a long Thanksgiving weekend:
</P>
<P>
   - With oil prices soaring but gasoline prices still well
behaved, why hasn't anyone called to compliment the oil companies
on their admirable pricing restraint?
</P>
<P>
   - Wake me when the proposed Power &AMP; Light District starts
revitalizing downtown Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   - Quick, when's the last time you heard something interesting,
insightful or informative on a sports-talk radio show?
</P>
<P>
   - One of the great paradoxes of the fledgling info technology
age is that the jurist sitting in judgment of Microsoft writes in
longhand.
</P>
<P>
   - How many people who object to banks charging noncustomers ATM
fees would themselves work for nothing or provide a service for
free?
</P>
<P>
   - When your conversational partner says, ``Anyway...'' after
you've finished having your say, do you feel as though what you've
just said was considered a bothersome interruption?
</P>
<P>
   - Those who worry about low voter turnout should stop wringing
their hands and start campaigning to have elections held on
weekends.
</P>
<P>
   - When politicians say they're forced out of the presidential
race for lack of money, what they're really saying is that their
message hasn't given potential backers reason enough to support
them financially.
</P>
<P>
   - You're getting old if you can remember when Chinese fortune
cookies told your fortune instead of offering inoffensive
platitudes.
</P>
<P>
   - What is it exactly the Reform Party plans to reform?
</P>
<P>
   - Anyone who says teen-agers suffer sleep deficits has never
been a parent of a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   - If you send me an e-mail attachment without identifying
yourself by name and affiliation, don't expect me to download it.
</P>
<P>
   - You're getting old if you can remember the last time David
Letterman said something funny enough to prompt a good
laugh-out-loud guffaw.
</P>
<P>
   - Anyone not scheduled to spend time in an airport this holiday
has much to be thankful for.
</P>
<P>
   - Is it my imagination, or are tort lawyers the only people
really deriving any significant financial benefit from most
class-action lawsuits?
</P>
<P>
   - If they made copiers simple enough for normal people to use
with ease, maybe the machines wouldn't be out of service most of
the time.
</P>
<P>
   - Now that the Glass-Steagall law has been consigned to
history's dustbin, what will members of Congress do to make up for
all the campaign contributions they won't be getting from financial
industry lobbyists seeking favors?

   WASHINGTON _ Eighteen Army reservists based in Bethany, Mo.,
will deploy to Kosovo next week, donning flak jackets and helmets
and doing what a grateful nation expects of them _ moving that
holiday mail.
</P>
<P>
   The 7,400 U.S. troops stationed as peacekeepers in the recent
Balkan war zone soon will expect incoming Christmas cards and
cookies from home, and that's where the 795th Adjutant General
Company (Postal) stands tall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We move mail and they want us there for Christmas,'' said Sgt.
Richard Rucker, unit administrator. ``We see this all the time; we
get deployed right around the holidays.''
</P>
<P>
   The northwest Missouri soldiers will ship out Thursday for a
nine-month tour. The 795th is the country's most-often deployed
postal unit out of 35 in the reserve system, Rucker said. It also
went to the Persian Gulf, Haiti and Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The unit will relieve active duty personnel who have run the
postal operation in Kosovo since April, Rucker said. The reservists
will work at a receiving center in Macedonia and at two camps in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are greatly appreciated when we get over there,'' Rucker
said. ``People want their mail. Our people know that. We know how
important it is to the soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing is hard on spouses, children, relatives and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know you are going over there for a purpose, but you still
have a family at home, and that's always on your mind,'' said
reservist Daryl Brandt of Leavenworth, Kan., who has a wife and
2-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   Brandt is the only one of the 18 reservists heading to Kosovo
who also did postal duty in the Persian Gulf, Haiti and Bosnia. Two
of those assignments overlapped the Christmas holidays, and one
began in early January, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, no one wants to leave at Christmas,'' said
reservist Patrick Jones of Chillicothe, Mo., who also did Gulf
duty. ``But I'm the one who signed on the dotted line and said I
wanted to serve my country.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 18 soldiers being dispatched from the unit, six are
married with children. Two are women, and some members of the unit
are barely out of high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are 18, 19, 20, and it's a big adventure for them,''
Rucker said.
</P>
<P>
   The 795th has 63 members, mostly from northwest Missouri but
some from the Kansas City area. A few of the higher-ranking
personnel are under orders to go to Kosovo, while others
volunteered.
</P>
<P>
   Postal service is the only mission of the 795th, but only one of
the 63 reservists is a postal worker by profession. Brandt is a
construction contractor. Jones is a voucher examiner at Department
of Defense offices in Kansas City. Other professions range from
teachers to police officers. Some are college students.
</P>
<P>
   Rucker said the potential for holiday postal assignments
overseas doesn't drive people to other reserve units or dissuade
them from re-enlisting.
</P>
<P>
   ``My people are a very tight-knit group, very family-oriented,''
Rucker said. ``They come here and they don't leave.'
