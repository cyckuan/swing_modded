<HEADLINE> Syria Never Gives Up Inch of Territories: Vice President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUSM, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Third Vice President
Mohammed Zouhair Musharaqah vowed Monday that his country would
never give up any inch of its territories or compromise its rights
and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The vow was made during the celebrations held by the Damascus
Committee of the ruling Arab Socialist Baathist Party at the
Damascus University to mark the 54th anniversary of Syrian
Liberation.
</P>
<P>
On April 17, 1946, the last soldier of the French occupation
forces left Syria, marking Syria's independence from French
colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
"The peace that is based on securing gains for the aggressor can
not be considered peace, it is rather a surrender that can lead to
a future struggle," Musharaqah said, noting that "many historical
facts testify to that."
</P>
<P>
"Peace must return the rights to their legitimate owners. On top
of such rights are the rights to land, sovereignty and security,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
"The party that insists on carving up a piece of land, usurping
part of the rights, and imposing hegemony, insists in fact on
achieving its hostile targets," the Syrian leader pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli peace talks, resumed last December after a
nearly-four-year break, have been stalled again since January.
Syria
demanded a written commitment from Israel to fully returning the
Israeli-occupied Golan Heights which it captured from Syria in the
1967 Middle East war. Israel refused to do so, demanding that
security arrangements and normalization of bilateral ties be
discussed first.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also disputed over the Tiberias Lake, or Sea of
Galilee. Syria insists on restoring its sovereignty over the
northeastern bank of the lake, while Israel claims full sovereignty
over the lake.
</P>
<P>
There are some proposals to break the deadlock such as launching
joint tourist projects by Syria and Israel or declaring the lake as
an international natural conservation.
</P>
<P>
Syria will remain committed to the peace process and adhere to
the principles and references on which the process was based,
Musharaqah added.

<HEADLINE> Water Deficit in Palestine Up To 436 Million Cubic Meters: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Water Department
(PWD) said in a report issued here on Monday that the water deficit
in Palestine reaches 436 million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
While the water demand in Palestine amounts to 740 million cubic
meters, the supply stands at 257 million only, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The only way to meet the deficit is to restore all the rights of
the Palestinians to water resources, according to Deputy Chief of
the PWD Fadl Kaoush.
</P>
<P>
Such resources include the surface and subterranean water inside
the West Bank and Gaza Strip and the Jordan River which is an
international basin, Kaoush explained.
</P>
<P>
Under the interim accords between the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) and Israel, the water quota of Palestinians were
estimated between 70 and 80 million cubic meters a year and later
on emergency quota was set at 28.6 million cubic meters, he added.
</P>
<P>
The water reserve in the West Bank exceeds 800 million cubic
meters including 600 million cubic meters of subterranean water
while the water reserve in Gaza Strip amounts to 100 million cubic
meters. The figures could meet the water demand of the three
million Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
However, the Israeli population estimated at five million people
and the 179,000 Jewish settlers consume up to 80 percent of the
Palestinian water supply.
</P>
<P>
The redistribution of water resources is one of the thorny
issues in the final status talks between the PNA and Israel that
started half a year ago without making any tangible progress.

<HEADLINE> Solution to Cyprus Issue no Precondition for EU Accession: European Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- European officials reaffirmed here
Monday that a Cyprus solution is not a precondition for the
island's accession to the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made at the 17th meeting of the EU-Cyprus Joint
Parliamentary Committee, which opened here Monday to discuss issues
such as the political situation in Cyprus, current EU-Cyprus
relations and Cyprus' accession negotiations with EU, environmental
protection and preservation of Cyprus' cultural heritage, safety in
the shipping sector.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session, Co-Chairwoman of the Committee,
European Parliament member Mechtild Rhote noted that the situation
in Cyprus is more positive because of improved Greek-Turkish
relations, increased international interest, especially on the part
of the U.S. in solving the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Cyprus' accession course, Rhote of Germany noted
that Cyprus is the only country which has closed 15 chapters in the
process of harmonization with EU membership criteria.
</P>
<P>
On Turkey's bid for EU membership, Rhote said it is
inconceivable for Europe to begin talks with Turkey as long as
Turkey occupies the northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that Europe will only support a just and
sustainable solution to the issue based on U.N. resolutions, which
provide for a bizonal, bicommunal federation formula.
</P>
<P>
The tiny Mediterranean island has remained divided into the
Turkish Cypriots-controlled north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated
south since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the northern
third of the island after a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
During the morning session, the EU presidency representative,
Leonardo Mathias, said "a fair and comprehensive settlement" to the
Cyprus issue can be reached and said that Cyprus' EU accession will
benefit both communities and will be the best guarantee for
security and prosperity for all.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Head of the European Commission Donato Chiarini
reminded that the EU Helsinki summit held last December concluded
that a solution is no precondition for accession despite the desire
for a united island to join the EU.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, along with Slovenia, Hungary, Poland, Estonia and the
Czech Republic, started substantive accession negotiations with EU
in November 1998. It hopes to be admitted as an EU member by
January 2003.
</P>
<P>
The joint meeting will end on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> A State Department Computer With Secret Information Missing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- A laptop computer containing
top-secret information disappeared from the State Department's
Bureau of Intelligence and Research more than a week ago, local
media reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Department spokesman James Rubin said the matter is being
investigated by the State Department 's office of Diplomatic
Security and the FBI, the Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post, quoting a person familiar with the
incident, said the missing computer contains "code word"
information, a classification higher than top secret, and that it
includes sensitive intelligence information and plans.
</P>
<P>
A senior State Department official said that it remained
unclear whether the laptop was misplaced or stolen.
</P>
<P>
The official added that the laptop's disappearance was not the
result of poor security procedures, but rather the failure of
State employees to follow those procedures. He said it appeared
that some contractors who have been renovating the department had
not been properly escorted when working in the building.
</P>
<P>
The post said the incident is the latest of a string of
embarrassing security breaches at the State Department. Last year,
counterintelligence officials from the FBI discovered a Russian
spy lurking outside the department and later an eavesdropping
device planted in a conference room.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, a man dressed in a tweed coat strolled into the
executive secretary's office, six doors down from the office of
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, helped himself to a
sheaf of classified briefing materials in plain view of two
secretaries, and walked out. The man was never identified and the
materials were never recovered.

<HEADLINE> Romania, One of Main Destinations for EBRD Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Romania represents the biggest
investment portfolio after Russia for the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), with as many as 55 projects
worth 1.45 million euros outlined so far, the official Rompres
news agency Monday quoted EBRD representative Juan Gamecho as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"There is no other country to receive a larger sum of money per
capita, a fact which stands proof for our trust in Romania,"
Gamecho stated.
</P>
<P>
The EBRD's net portfolio in Romania amounts to 1.28 billion
euros at which are added another 175 million euros as direct
investment.
</P>
<P>
"We want to increase the number of direct investments as we
want to acquire as much as possible in the Romanian economy," the
EBRD representative stressed.
</P>
<P>
The main fields the EBRD invested in are telecommunications,
with around 180 million U.S. dollars, and the transport and
financial sectors as well as city projects regarding water, gas
and electric energy distribution.
</P>
<P>
The EBRD grants convertible credits to developing companies,
the reimbursement period being up to seven years.
</P>
<P>
"We can lend initially a sum of money and after the company is
privatized, we can turn the credit in investment in equipment and
thus the company will have nothing more to pay because we become
partners," Gamecho said.
</P>
<P>
The EBRD wants to increase the volume of its investments in the
Romanian economy by half a billion euros until 2002, when its
shareholders' General Assembly takes place in Bucharest.
</P>
<P>
The EBRD is interested in the last privatization and
restructuring program of the State Ownership Fund, infrastructure
projects, small and medium-sized companies and industry, Romania's
biggest source for jobs.

<P>
NAIROBI, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Major General Paul Kagame was
elected the President of Rwanda on Monday for the remaining three
years of the transitional period and will take office on Saturday.

<TEXT>
<P>
Kampala, April 17 (Xinhua) -- About two million Ugandans have
been confirmed dead as a result of HIV/AIDS, one of the key
killer diseases in this east African country.
</P>
<P>
Uganda AIDS Commission (UAC) Director Kihumuro Apuuli made the
 revelation when meeting with an Indian delegation of AIDS control
here Monday, Radio Uganda reported.
</P>
<P>
About 500,000 people in the country have been affected with the
epidemic,
</P>
<P>
Apuuli said, adding that at least 1.9 million children have been
orphaned due to wide-spread HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The first case of AIDS was reported in Uganda in 1982. AIDS
prevalence rate was as high as over 30 percent in late 1980s and
early 1990s. It has dropped to 10 percent due to the government's
increasing efforts against the disease and great enhancement of
people's awareness. Uganda is the only African country where AIDS
prevalence rate is dropping.
</P>
<P>
The Indian 13-member delegation is here on one-week visit to
learn from the Ugandan experience in AIDS control.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Enhance Rural Electricity Coverage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kampala, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has vowed
to increase the rural electricity coverage in the country from
current one percent to 10 percent in the next 10 years, a senior
government official has said.
</P>
<P>
Syda Bumba, minister of energy and mineral development, made
the revelation at the handover ceremony of a Japan-aided power
station in Mukono district, 25 km east of the capital city
Kampala, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is the policy of the government to provide
sustainable and coordinative rural electrification strategies for
the whole country, according to a Radio Uganda report.
</P>
<P>
The rural electrification project was constructed by the Japan
 International Cooperation Agency at a cost of 10 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan annual electricity production stands at 180
megawatts against a demand of 260 megawatts. The national
electricity coverage is now five percent, over 80 percent of
which is in the three main cities of Kampala, Entebbe and Jinja.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Yemen Can Promote Regional Security: Khatami </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
said here on Monday that Iran and Yemen could effectively
contribute to regional security through close cooperation.
</P>
<P>
As the two countries are enjoying highly sensitive strategic
positions in the Middle East, cooperation between Iran and Yemen
can effectively contribute to security and stability of the region,
Khatami told a joint press conference with his visiting Yemeni
counterpart Ali Abdullah Saleh.
</P>
<P>
Khatami stressed that security would be established when
regional states help each other based on mutual respect and free
from any interference in each other's internal affairs, the Islamic
Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated Iran's opposition to foreign intervention in
regional affairs, noting that regional states must rely on their
own capabilities without resorting to foreigners, whose presence
runs counter to the regional security.
</P>
<P>
Regional states should protect security not only for themselves
but for the world, Khatami said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Iran is ready to cooperate with Yemen in all
fields, hailing that unity between two Yemens in 1990 is a great
success for the Yemeni nation and an important event for the entire
region.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that a high-ranking delegation from Iran would
take part in ceremonies and festivities marking unification of
North Yemen and South Yemen on May 22.
</P>
<P>
Saleh, for his part, hoped that following his visit to Tehran
several cooperation agreements would reach with Iranians officials
so as to further expand bilateral relations, IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Fisheries, sea, ground and air transportation and housing are
among fields where Iran and Yemen may have good cooperation with
each other, the Yemeni president pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Saleh arrived here Monday afternoon with a 90-member delegation
comprising government ministers and other senior officials.

<HEADLINE> Substantive Talks Called for to Solve Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The leaders of the Greek and
Turkish Cypriot communities on the divided Cyprus island must hold
substantive talks based on U.N. resolutions to solve the Cyprus
issue, leaders of two parties on the Cyprus island appealed on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made at a meeting between Cyprus' left-wing AKEL
party General Secretary Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot
Patriotic Unity Movement leader Izzet Izcan, the Cyprus News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the only way that can reunite the country is
through a federation formula.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island in the wake of a failed coup seeking
union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for years to bring the two sides back
together in a bizonal, bicommunal federation formula but all
efforts have failed so far.
</P>
<P>
Two rounds of U.N.-sponsored proximity talks have been held
between the two sides to lay the ground for substantive
negotiations which may lead to a comprehensive settlement of the
Cyprus issue. The third round of talks are due to begin on May 23
in New York.
</P>
<P>
Izcan said that his Movement and AKEL will soon announce events
organized by the two parties, which "work for the unity of the
country, for democracy, human rights and a solution" to the Cyprus
issue.
</P>
<P>
He said that the federal formula "is the only solution which can
reunite the country, which can be accepted by international law and
which is based on U.N. resolutions and the 1977 and 1979 high level
agreements" by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Izcan said that "the majority of the Turkish Cypriots are in
favor of a federal solution" and stressed the need for
rapprochement between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Christofias said that "good will" is needed on both sides to
solve the Cyprus issue and noted that "a substantive dialogue must
take place."
</P>
<P>
He added that both sides must grasp the opportunities available
toward this end and that every form of contact between the two
sides contributes to this goal.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from both AKEL and the Patriotic Unity Movement
attended a Greek and Turkish Cypriot political parties' meeting in
February at the U.N.-controlled buffer zone in Nicosia, which was
the first official contact between the two sides since 1997.

<HEADLINE> Annan: Consensus On Precise, Specific Aims of Sanctions Must be Achieved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 17 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Monday said that it is not enough to make sanctions
"smart", and the challenge is to achieve consensus about the
precise and specific aims of the sanctions, adjust the instruments
accordingly and then provide the necessary means.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the seminar on sanctions by the International Peace
Academy, Annan said "we recognize the importance of sanctions as a
way of compelling compliance with the will of the international
community, we also recognized that sanctions remain a blunt
instrument, which hurt large numbers of people who are not their
primary targets,"
</P>
<P>
"Sanctions need refining if they are to be seen as more than a
figleaf in the future," the U.N. chief said.
</P>
<P>
The Secretariat has undertaken a review of lessons learned from
recent sanctions regimes, focusing in particular on the need to
protect vulnerable communities from the effects of sanctions,
while improving the targeting of elites, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
The review has also illustrated the need for credible
monitoring mechanisms for sanctions regimes, and the importance of
having necessary resources to effectively administer them, Annan
said.
</P>
<P>
"We at the United Nations and in the international community
at large need to make greater efforts to ensure that when
sanctions are imposed against a Member State, we are able to make
a clear and convincing case for their necessity and their ultimate
aim," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that the last decades' proliferation of sanctions
regimes and the diverse range of purposes for which they were
employed have imposed on the international community a heavy
obligation to ensure that this instrument is employed with great
care and a clear understanding of its effects, both intended and
unintended," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Annan expressed the hope the Security Council would further
take a broader look at the issuers which arise in respect of
sanctions regimes and that it would take into account recent Swiss
and German studies aimed at improving targeted financial sanctions
and arms embargoes.

<HEADLINE> China Sincere in Fulfilling Obligations Under Human Rights Treaties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is very
sincere in fulfilling its obligations under the human rights
treaties to which it has acceded, including its reporting
obligations, said a Chinese official here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government attaches great importance to the
positive role played by international human rights treaties,"
Special Advisor of the Chinese delegation Liu Jing told the 56th
session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. "China
has ratified or acceded to 17 international human rights treaties.
"
</P>
<P>
China is now a signatory to the International Covenant on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Since the last session of the UN commission, Liu said, the
Chinese government has submitted to the relevant treaty body its
third periodic report on the implementation of the Convention
against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
Punishment. It is now in the process of drafting the combined
eighth and ninth periodic report on its implementation of the
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial
Discrimination and preparing its second periodic report on the
implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
</P>
<P>
Respectively on July 1, 1997 and December 20, 1999, the Chinese
government resumed its sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao, and
established thereafter the Special Administrative Region of Hong
Kong and Special Administrative Region of Macao of the People's
Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
As for the implementation of human rights treaties in the two
Special Administrative Regions (SARs), China has laws which
stipulate that relevant provisions in the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights which were applicable in Hong
Kong and Macao shall remain valid in the two Special
Administrative Regions and shall be implemented through their
respective local laws.
</P>
<P>
Concerning reporting obligations, Liu said that the two SARs
are each responsible for preparing their own reports on treaty
implementation and answering questions raised by treaty bodies
during consideration. Based on this arrangement, the Special
Administrative Region of Hong Kong of China, since the conclusion
of our last session, has accepted the consideration by the
relevant treaty body its report on the implementation of the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
</P>
<P>
"This kind of practice both enriches the experience of the
international community in implementing international human rights
treaties and demonstrates fully the importance the Chinese
government attaches to international human rights treaties," he
said.

OTTAWA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Canada's annual inflation rate
rose to 3 percent in March, compared with 2.7 percent recorded for
the previous month, Statistics Canada reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
On a month-to-month basis, the inflation jump reached 0.7
percent between February and March, the largest since January 1991.
</P>
<P>
More than half that increase was due to gasoline prices, which
accounted for 57 percent of the monthly rise.

<P>
Gasoline prices rose 8.8 percent in March and, on an annual
basis, were 38 percent higher than that of last year.
</P>
<P>
The annual core rate, excluding food and energy, was 1.4
percent from February's 1.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Blair to Mediate Between Russia and U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said on Monday that he was ready to mediate between Russia and the
United States on the anti-ballistic missile treaty.
</P>
<P>
Blair told a joint news conference after talks with visiting
Russian President-elect Vladimir Putin that Britain's role was to
"try to build understanding".
</P>
<P>
"As I said to President Putin during the course of our talks,
our role in this is very much to try and build understanding of
respective points of view, both of Russia and the United States,"
Blair said.
</P>
<P>
This comment came after Putin reiterated his opposition to U.S.
plans to create its own national anti-missile system.
</P>
<P>
The United States is set to create its own national anti-
missile system, banned under the 1972 anti-ballistic missile (ABM
treaty.
</P>
<P>
Russia, which ratified another key disarmament treaty with the
United States last Friday, said in the ratification bill that it
would quit the 1993 START-2 strategic missile treaty if Washington
violated the ABM treaty.
</P>
<P>
However, Putin said on Monday that Moscow was ready to "conduct
a dialogue" on the issue.
</P>
<P>
"Our legislation strictly links these two things, but I want to
draw your attention to the fact that at the time, at the proposal
of the American side, we have drawn a line between strategic and
non-strategic defense," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In this very context we are ready to conduct a dialogue," said
Putin, without giving any further details.

<HEADLINE> Globalization Straining Earth's Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Globalization presents growing
threats to the planet and its inhabitants, and channeling
globalization to protect the earth's natural systems is key to
building an environmentally stable society in the 21st century,
according a new report from the Worldwatch Institute.
</P>
<P>
"The surge in movements of goods, money, species, and pollution
across international borders is placing unprecedented strains on
the planet," said Hilary French, vice president for research of
the Washington DC-based institute.
</P>
<P>
"Ironically, the best way to tackle these problems is by
putting globalization to work for us, instead of against us." said
French, who is also author of Vanishing Borders: Protecting the
Planet in the Age of Globalization.
</P>
<P>
Globalization is a powerful driving force behind today's
unprecedented biological implosion. An upsurge of trade and
investment in natural resources sectors such as forestry, mining,
and petroleum development is threatening the health of the world's
forests, mountains, waters, and other sensitive ecosystems.
</P>
<P>
International commerce is also a potent mechanism through which
hazardous products and technologies move around the world. Over
the last few decades, the developing world has become home to a
growing share of the hazard-laden petrochemical industry, said
French.
</P>
<P>
About 41 percent of U.S. foreign direct investment in the
Philippines in 1998 was in chemicals, as was 22 percent of such
investment in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
High tech industries such as computers and electronics have
also gone global in recent years. Despite their early reputation
as relatively clean. these industries can exact heavy
environmental cost.
</P>
<P>
Semiconductor manufacturing employs hundreds of chemicals,
including arsenic, benzene, and chromium, all of which are known
carcinogens. More than half of all computer manufacturing and
assembly operations are now located in developing countries,
according to the San Jose, California-based Silicon Valley Toxics
Coalition.
</P>
<P>
Despite the environmental risks, French pointed out, the forces
of globalization can also produce environmental gains, such as
helping developing countries leapfrog to the cleaner technologies
of tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
For instance, China has become the world's largest manufacturer
of energy-efficient compact fluorescent light bulbs in recent
years, in part through joint ventures with lighting firms based in
Hongkong, Japan, and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
And India has become a major manufacturer of advanced wind
turbines with the help of technology obtained through joint
ventures and licensing agreements with Danish, Dutch, and German
firms.
</P>
<P>
Several countries are working to harness the global economy to
protect rather than decimate natural wealth. Cost Rica is now a
major destination for eco-tourists, and Mexico now has some 10,000
organic farms on 15,000 hectares of land.
</P>
<P>
French said redirecting the global economy away from
environmentally harmful activities and into more sustainable ones
will require a multi-pronged strategy, starting with requiring
international economic institutions to pay more heed to the
environmental impact of their programs.
</P>
<P>
She was concerned that although environmental treaties now
number more than 230, the effectiveness of these agreements is
often undermined by vague commitments and lax enforcement.
</P>
<P>
The current scattered collection of environmental treaty bodies
should be coordinated and strengthened, French said.
</P>
<P>
French also called for the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund to take into account sustained development while
making policies and decisions.

<HEADLINE> New Report Reveals Widespread Decline in World's Ecosystems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
And if the decline of the world's ecosystems - the interaction
of organisms with their physical environment - continues, it could
have devastating implications for human development and the
welfare of all species, the study said.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary report, based on a two-year study by 197
scientists, is published by the United Nations Development Program
(UNDP), the UN Environment Program (UNEP), the World Bank and the
World Resources Institute. The full report is to be released in
September.
</P>
<P>
The report examines coastal, forest, grassland, freshwater and
agricultural ecosystems, and analyzes their health on the basis of
their ability to produce the goods and services that the world
currently relies on.
</P>
<P>
These include production of food, provision of pure and
sufficient water, storage of atmospheric carbon, maintenance of
biodiversity and provision of recreation and tourism opportunities.
</P>
<P>
"For too long in both rich and poor nations, development
priorities have focused on how much humanity can take from our
ecosystems, with little attention to the impact of our actions,"
said Mark Malloch Brown, UNDP administrator. "With this report, we
reconfirm our commitment to making the viability of the world's
ecosystems a critical development priority for the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
Among the scientists' findings and statistics:
</P>
<P>
-- Half of the world's wetlands were lost last century.
</P>
<P>
-- Logging and conversion have shrunk the world's forests by as
much as half, and some nine percent of the world's tree species
are at risk of extinction; tropical deforestation may exceed 130,
000 square kilometers per year.
</P>
<P>
-- Fishing fleets are 40 percent larger than the ocean can
sustain, and nearly 70 percent of the world's major fish stocks
are overfished or are being fished at their biological limit.
</P>
<P>
-- Soil degradation has affected two-thirds of the world's
agricultural lands in the last 50 years, and some 30 percent of
the world's original forests have been converted to agriculture.
</P>
<P>
-- Dams, diversions or canals fragment almost 60 percent of the
world's largest rivers, and twenty percent of the world's
freshwater fish are extinct, threatened or endangered.
</P>
<P>
Scientist recommend in the report that governments and people
must view the sustainability of ecosystems as essential to human
life.
</P>
<P>
"Governments and businesses must rethink some basic assumptions
about how we measure and plan economic growth," said James D.
Wolfensohn, World Bank president. "The poor, who often depend
directly on ecosystems for their livelihoods, suffer most when
ecosystems are degraded."

<TEXT>
<P>
"He will go to Belfast tomorrow to meet the parties and take
stock of what is a difficult situation," a Reuters report quoted a
spokesman for Blair as saying in London.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Blair will meet Northern Ireland parties and
Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern.
</P>
<P>
"He want to hear first hand from the parties how they see the
way forward," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Blair's intervention comes at a critical time for a peace
process in danger of going into long political limbo over the
tortuous issue of guerrilla disarmament.
</P>
<P>
British and Irish officials are currently working together in a
bid to put in practice the Dood Friday agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Reuters report said Blair's visit would probably be a
listening exercise to gauge the views of feuding parties rather
than one heralding a breakthrough.

<HEADLINE> Security Council to Debate on Sanctions Regimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council is scheduled Monday afternoon to hold an open
debate on the sanction regimes in a bid to make them more
effective.
</P>
<P>
Imposing sanctions is regarded as a way of compelling
compliance with the will of the international community. It also
remains a blunt instrument which hurt large numbers of people who
are not their primary targets.
</P>
<P>
Under Article 41 of the U.N. Charter, the United Nations
Security Council may call upon Member States to apply measures not
involving the use of armed force in order to maintain or restore
international peace and security. Such measures are commonly
referred to as sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council has imposed sanctions in fourteen cases:
Afghanistan, Angola, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Haiti, Iraq,
Liberia, Libya, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Africa,
Southern Rhodesia, Sudan and former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In the case of Haiti, South Africa, Southern Rhodesia and
former Yugoslavia, sanctions have been fully lifted.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Report: World Ecosystems Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The decline is due to rising resource demands which have
devastating implications for human development and the welfare of
all species, the U.N. Development Program (UNDP) and other U.N.
agencies said in an advance press release on their forthcoming
report.
</P>
<P>
Half of the world's wetlands were lost last century and logging
and conversion have shrunk the world's forests by as much as half,
according to the report to be published in September.
</P>
<P>
The report, the Guide to the World Resources 2000-2001: People
and Ecosystems: The Fraying Web of Life, has also found:
</P>
<P>
the global economy has tripled in size while population has
grown by 30 percent to six billion people in the last two decades;
</P>
<P>
some 9 percent of the world's tree species are at risk of
extinction;
</P>
<P>
fishing fleets are 40 percent larger than the ocean can sustain;
</P>
<P>
nearly 70 percent of the world's major marine fish stocks are
overfished or are being fished at their biological limit;
</P>
<P>
soil degradation has affected two-thirds of the world's
agricultural lands in the last 50 years;
</P>
<P>
some 30 percent of the world's original forests have been
converted to agriculture.
</P>
<P>
An important conclusion the U.N. agencies have drawn is that
there is a lack of the knowledge needed to properly determine
ecosystems conditions on a global, regional and local scale.

<HEADLINE> Italian President Refuses D'Alema's Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The protocol used meant that Ciampi did not accept D'Alema's
resignation on the grounds that Parliament was the proper forum to
verify whether he was still in a position to govern, a spokesman
for the presidential Quirinale Palace explained.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Bloc center-right won control of eight Italian
regions in the regional election held Sunday, leaving the center-
left with seven of the nine they won at last vote in 1995.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with the head of state, D'Alema told the press
that he left it would be "a serious mistake" to dissolve
parliament in the near future.
</P>
<P>
"A referendum has been scheduled, one admitted by the
Constitutional Court, which involves the electoral law," the
premier explained, "My opinion is that it is the duty of
Parliament to reform the electoral law and give (Italy) a system
which guarantees greater stability and authority to the government
".
</P>
<P>
In explaining his decision to offer his resignation, D'Alema
told the press "I believe it is right, out of political
correctness and certainly not institutional duty, to recognize the
result of the hard political confrontation in the regional
elections which saw the success of the opposition which had, from
the beginning, demanded the resignation of the government".
</P>
<P>
Turning his attention to the decision which Parliament will
make, D'Alema concluded "it will be my responsibility to accept it
".

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 17(Xinhua) -- For the third year in a row,
finance ministers, departing from the spring meeting of the World
Bank and International Monetary Fund, will meet with the U.N.
Economic and Social Council(ECOSOC) at U.N.Headquarters in New
York Tuesday on international financial stability.
</P>
<P>
The one-day meeting is designed to allow a free-flowing
dialogue between high-level participants from ECOSOC member
countries and a panel of finance ministers who were present at the
Bank/Fund spring meetings.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. General Assembly recommended in its resolution that

cover means to achieve a strengthened and more stable
international financial system and economic and social equity in
the global economy.
</P>
<P>
The first meeting of Bretton Woods with ECOSOC, in 1998, took
place against the backdrop of worldwide financial crisis. Last

financial market and prospects for the availability of sufficient
resources for global development needs.
</P>
<P>
The discussion this year have added relevance in light of a
commitment made by the U.N. General Assembly to hold an

<HEADLINE> France Publishes Report on Robbed Jewish Properties in Holocaust </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mission of study on the robbery of Jews in France, presided
by Jean Matteoli, said that among properties robbed were banking
accounts, enterprises and properties and properties of Jews
arrested and sent to concentration camps in France.
</P>
<P>
The report said that from 90 to 95 percent of these properties
have been returned to their owners since 1945.
</P>
<P>
It also said that besides the robbery by the French state, the
German occupying forces also took many Jewish properties including
objects of art and properties of high value deposited in the banks.
</P>
<P>
Most of the Jewish properties robbed by the Nazis have been
returned by Germany since 1957, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Among the estimated 100,000 objects of art robbed by the Nazis,
61,000 have been returned to France and 45,000 of them to their
original owners, said the report.
</P>
<P>
However, 2,000 paintings believed to be robbed Jewish
properties still are displayed in national museums across France,
it said.
</P>
<P>
The French Communist parliament group Monday also proposed the
making of a law aimed at ``fully compensating the victims of the
robbery by the Nazis and the French state'' during World War II.

<HEADLINE> Greek Stocks Suffer Biggest Drop in History  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Affected by the declining New
York Stock Exchange and other international stock markets, equity
prices in Greece suffered their biggest drop ever on the Athens
Stock Exchange (ASE) Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ASE general index plunged 9.17 percent to 4,064.85 points,
and the FTSE/ASE 20 index ended at 2,301.02 points, down 9.16
percent.
</P>
<P>
Turnover was a moderate 145 billion drachmas (about 416
million U.S. dollars) and decliners led advancers by 332 to two
with another two issues unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The leasing and construction sectors led the falling stock
market by dropping 9.95 percent and 9.96 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
On March 14, the Greek stocks suffered a 6.6 percent drop and
a 5.29 percent last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Monday's ASE losses, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said that there was a crisis in the international
stock market and the ASE was impossible to be unaffected.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Greek economic prospects were positive and
justified a medium-and long-term advance in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that the firm position of the Greek
government was to shield the stock market and undertake specific
initiatives.

<HEADLINE> Draft Report on Lesotho Election Completed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 17 (Xinhua) -- A special two-man team has
completed a preliminary report on reviewing preparations for
Lesotho's forthcoming general elections, South African Press
Association reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The team, appointed by the Commonwealth Secretariat and the
Southern African Development Community (SADC), includes Kwadwo
Afari-Gyan, Chairman of the Electoral Commission of Ghana, and
Jorgen Elklit, who monitored South Africa's 1994 elections.
</P>
<P>
During their stay in Lesotho, Afari-Gyan and Elklit held talks
with the Lesotho government, the staff of Lesotho's Independent
Electoral Commission (IEC), the Interim Political Authority and
the donor community to collect impressions from them on a
realistic timetable for the holding of the new elections.
</P>
<P>
They will present their preliminary report to the Commonwealth
 Secretariat and the SADC before presenting it to the Lesotho
government.
</P>
<P>
After the political crisis in Lesotho arising from the disputed
May 1998 general election results, it was agreed that new
elections should be held within 18 months from November 16, 1998.
</P>
<P>
But Elklit said: "The time remaining is so short that under no
 circumstances can general elections be held on or before May 16."
</P>
<P>
He added that a further drawback is the fact that the
newly-appointed members of the IEC has not yet been sworn in.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean President Meets White Farmers Over Farm Invasions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
on Monday met the leaders of white commercial farmers to discuss
the occupation of about 1,000 farms by the black war veterans.
</P>
<P>
President of the Commercial Farmers' Union Tim Henwood and
President of Zimbabwe Tobacco Association Richard Tate held a
two-hour meeting with Mugabe, which they described as fruitful and
"very good", the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, the first since the war veterans invaded
white-owned farms almost two months ago, came a day after Mugabe
said he would not order the war veterans to withdraw from the
occupied farms.
</P>
<P>
There might be another meeting on Tuesday, Independence Day, to
further discuss the land issue.
</P>
<P>
The commercial farmers appealed to the President to help
restore the situation to normal, saying that this could only
happen with the withdrawal of the war veterans from the occupied
farms.
</P>
<P>
"We discussed the situation, which includes the land issue and
the disruption to agriculture. We appealed to the President to
restore things to normal. We were given an assurance by the
President. We had a very good discussion," Henwood said.
</P>
<P>
He said the commercial farmers reaffirmed their support for the
land redistribution program.
</P>
<P>
Tate said they made suggestions to the President on the land
redistribution process, but could not be drawn to reveal the
proposals.
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of land available. We made suggestions and we
will let the President announce them. Everyone must contribute
and we should all work together," he said.
</P>
<P>
Henwood pointed out that the land issue was a Zimbabwean
problem, which needed a Zimbabwean solution.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed offers by the British to evacuate the white
commercial farmers.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 white-owned commercial farms have been invaded
by former freedom fighters, saying they have lost patience at the
pace at which the government is implementing its land
redistribution program.
</P>
<P>
The war veterans of the 1970s liberation struggle have vowed to
remain on the farms, despite the passing of an amendment to the
constitution which allows the government to acquire land without
compensation.
</P>
<P>
Henwood has in the past said the invasions could cost the
country millions of dollars, including the much-needed foreign
currency.
</P>
<P>
He said that they appealed to the President to intervene in
Macheke where a white commercial farmer was shot dead allegedly by
war veterans.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Delays Opening of Tobacco Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's tobacco auction floors,
one of the world's main tobacco markets, are now likely to open
sometime in May, instead of the scheduled April 26, due to the
disruptions at some commercial farms by war veterans, an official
said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
President of the Zimbabwe Tobacco Association Richard Tate told
 reporters after meeting President Robert Mugabe that because of
the farm invasions, the opening of the auction floors would have
to be delayed further to May.
</P>
<P>
He dispelled rumors that the tobacco farmers were threatening
to withhold the crop until the Zimbabwean dollar devalues further.
</P>
<P>
He said because of the farm invasions, about 70 farms had been
deserted.
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 commercial farms have been invaded by the war
veterans countrywide since February.
</P>
<P>
Farmers are expecting to sell 220 million kilograms of
flue-cured tobacco, well above last year's 196 million kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco is the country's biggest foreign currency earner.
</P>
<P>
Tate said they also discussed a further devaluation of the
dollar with the President.
</P>
<P>
He did not give a preferred rate, but some commercial farmers
have suggested that to break even, the Zimbabwean dollar should
devalue to 78 against the U.S. dollar from 38.
</P>
<P>
While waiting for the commercial farmers, President Mugabe
indicated to acting Agriculture Minister Joyce Mujuru that the
government would not agree to devalue the dollar further.
</P>
<P>
Governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe Leonard Tsumba has
already dismissed possibilities of a further devaluation.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is grappling with an unsteady currency which fell by
over 50 percent last year and is only being held stable by an
informal control by the banks.

HARARE, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Police on Monday said
they will maintain a heavy presence on all the country's major
roads to ensure peaceful and accident-free Independence and Easter
holidays.

Police Spokesman Chief Superintendent Wayne Bvudzijena said
travelers and motorists should expect to encounter numerous road

LUANDA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Foreign Minister Joao
Miranda said here on Monday that he will urge the United Nations
Security Council to reinforce the sanctions against the Angolan
rebels and take stern measures against those countries and
individuals that violated the sanctions.
</P>

attend the session of the Security Council on the issue of the
sanctions against the rebel National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) on Tuesday.

Miranda said that he will also appeal to the Security Council
to take measures to cut the telecommunication network of the
UNITA, which has helped the rebels undertake terrorist actions
including ambushes, robbery and kidnapping of young male
villagers.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister stressed that the report put forward by

<HEADLINE> Washington Summit Substantial, Basic in Pushing Peace Process: Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
asserted here Monday that his upcoming summit meeting with U.S.
President Bill Clinton in Washington is a "substantial and basic
point" in pushing forward the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the remarks following his meeting with visiting
Omani Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Yousef Bin Alawi Bin
Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Clinton are due to meet in Washington on April 20 in
an effort to advance the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian talks at the
Bolling Air Base near Washington.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are striving hard to draft a framework agreement
by May for a final peace treaty by September.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Clinton himself supervised the signing of
the Oslo and Wye River agreements by the Palestinian and Israeli
sides, and he also supervised the recent peace march by sending
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to attend the signing
ceremony for the Sharm el Sheikh memorandum on behalf of him last
September.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said his meeting with Clinton comes within this movement,
noting that Clinton demanded Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak make
progress on negotiations with the Palestinians, the Syrians and the
Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also stressed that he supports such a positive movement
and trend since it is consistent with what has been agreed in the
Madrid peace conference in 1991, which was designed for bringing
about a comprehensive and lasting peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader confirmed that "the independent state
will be set up this year."
</P>
<P>
On his part, Yousef said he conveyed a message to Arafat from
Omani Sultan Qaboos Bin Said which expressed the Omani people's
support to the Palestinians and their just cause at "this crucial
stage."
</P>
<P>
The minister said he discussed with Arafat the latest
developments of the peace process, and the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that the coordinated efforts being exerted
by the Arab countries will be positive for the sake of Arab nations
and the Palestinian cause.
</P>
<P>
The Omani minister indicated that his country and the
Palestinian leadership support the holding of an Arab summit in the
very near future.
</P>
<P>
Yousef is here on a working visit to Palestine as part of a
Middle East trip which has also taken him to Egypt.
</P>

While in Cairo, he stressed on the need to hold an Arab summit
to discuss the peace process, especially the suspended Syrian-
Israeli talks.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli talks, resumed last December after a nearly-
four-year break, have been stalled again since January. Syria
demanded a written commitment from Israel to fully returning the
Israeli-occupied Golan Heights which it captured from Syria in the
1967 Middle East war. Israel refused to do so, demanding that
security arrangements and normalization of bilateral ties be
discussed first.

Meanwhile, Arafat's advisor Nabil Abu Redina said Arafat's
meeting with Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein, slated for
Monday, has been postponed to Tuesday or until Arafat returns from
Washington.

<HEADLINE> Tehran Municipal Council Protests Arrest of Reformist Councilor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The municipal council of the
Iranian capital city Tehran Monday lodged a strong protest against
the arrest of its reformist member Ahmad Hakimipour who was on
charge of
having a hand in an abortive assassination.
</P>
<P>
Issuing a statement, the council said that following the
assassination attempt against the life the council's deputy
chairman Saeed Hajjarian on February 12, moves are under way to
divert the issue from its main course.
</P>
<P>
"The agents of threat who are known to the public are free while
Hakimipour who had saved the life of Hajjarian through devotion and
self-sacrifice has been arrested," said the statement quoted by the
Islamic Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The council also called on officials concerned to give response
to the concern of the council and the public on the issue as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
Hakimipour was arrested by the conservative revolutionary court
on Friday on the confessions of other people arrested for the
assassination attempt against Hajjarian, a senior advisor to the
moderate President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Hajjarian, who was also former deputy intelligence minister, was
seriously wounded in a shooting in front of the council hall in
downtown Tehran and Hakimipour rushed him to a nearby hospital.
Hajjarian recovered his consciousness in recent weeks following a
long coma.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Hakimipour became a suspect in the
assassination case because a letter handed over to Hajjarian, which
prepared the ground for the assassination attempt, was signed by
Hakimipour.
</P>
<P>
The conservative Judiciary said on Sunday that Hakimipour was
detained in Zajan province, central Iran, after he refused to
appear
in court to give explanations and was transferred to Tehran for
trial.
</P>
<P>
However, some reformist groups and parties said that bringing
Hakimipour's letter to the assassination scene was a well-designed
plot by certain people to crack down on the reformists, who won an
overwhelming victory in February key parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Newspapers closed to the powerful conservatives, who dominate
most of the country's sensitive organs, urged the authorities to
find the relations between Hakimipour and other suspects.
</P>
<P>
Widespread rumors here had claimed that the conservatives were
behind the assassination attempt against Hajjarian because he
played an important role in the reformists' victory, a result which
humiliated the conservatives.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Installs First Barge Mounted Power Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's first ever barge
mounted thermal power plant was installed Monday at the Colombo
port to add 60 megawatts of power to the national grid.
</P>
<P>
"Testing and commissioning will commence in May and completion
of the plant is scheduled by end of June. The commercial operation
will start from the beginning of July 2000," said Akitsu Odagaki,
chairman of Colombo Power (Pvt) Ltd. which installed the plant.
</P>
<P>
He told a new conference here on Monday evening that the plant
will be owned, operated and maintained by the company until the
year 2015 under a power purchase agreement signed in February 1999
with Sri Lanka's Ceylon Electricity Board.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of the Ministry of Irrigation and Power Jaliya
Medagama said the plant is part of the government's efforts to
encourage private sector's participation into power sector.
</P>
<P>
He said Sri Lanka aims to attract 2.5 billion U.S. dollars
during the next seven years in the power sector in a bid to double
electric energy production.
</P>
<P>
Medagama said the country will rely more on thermal power plant
in the future in order to provide electricity to 47 percent of Sri
Lanka's 19 million population who still have no access to
electricity.
</P>
<P>
The floating plant, which costs around 72 million dollars, was
constructed in Japan on a Build, Own and Operate (BOO) basis by
Colombo Power (Pvt) Ltd., a joint company equally owned by two
Japanese firms, Mitsui Engineering and Shipbuilding Company and
Kawasho Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The plant, brought to Sri Lanka by a massive ship last weekend
and anchored five kilometers away in the deep seas in the outer
harbor of the Colombo port, was taken out of the ship and towed by
tugs into the area in which it was installed at the Colombo port
Monday morning.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Developed Countries to Open Markets to Developing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Developing countries are by and large in the process of
fulfilling their obligations in the agreements concluded in the
Uruguay Round, but developed countries have failed to fully
implement their part specified in the Uruguay Round negotiations
with regard to further opening their markets," said Jin Liqun,
vice minister of finance of China, at the 61th meeting of the
Development Committee, the policy-setting group for the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
China supports the World Bank's efforts in urging developed
countries to pen their markets, Jin said, adding that it is
unreasonable for the developed countries to apply "double
standards" on market access.
</P>
<P>
"While urging developing countries to open those markets where
developed countries enjoy dominating advantages, developed
countries are protecting those of their own domestic industries
where they have long lost comparative advantages, and the barriers
against products of such industries from developing countries
remain high," he said.
</P>
<P>
Such "double standards," Jin added, is harmful not only to
developing countries, but also to the long-term interests of
developed countries themselves.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese official said for quite a long time, developing
countries have not been successfully integrated into the world
trading system. The primary reason for this failure, he said, is
that under the current system developing countries have not been
in an equal position vis-a-vis their trade partners from developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
Jin called on international development institutions to help
developing countries explore how to get equal opportunities and
benefits from trade liberalization.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the poverty reduction issue, Jin said the World
Bank must have a long-term commitment, and stable and continued
policies would be very important to the effectiveness and
efficiency of poverty reduction.
</P>
<P>
The most efficient way to reduce poverty has proved to be
through promotion of economic growth and improvement of income
distribution, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"The past experience has long proved that the World Bank's
comparative advantage still lies in its strength of providing
financial resources and technical assistance to promote economic
growth in developing countries, for the purpose of poverty
reduction," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice minister stressed that developed countries
should take concrete measures to reverse the declining trend of
international official assistance and major developed countries
should increase their official development assistance as soon as
possible to reach 0.7 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), a
target set by the United Nations.

<P>
"The Government of Israel indicates it will cooperate fully
with the United Nations in the implementation of its decision,"
said a statement issued Monday by Annan's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the U.N. chief is studying the implications
of this decision and he is notifying the Security Council of the
contents of the letter dated April 16 from Israeli Foreign
Minister David Levy.
</P>
<P>
Annan will consult with the parties and other concerned
governments in the region and more widely, said the spokesman,
adding that contingency planning in the Secretariat is already
underway.
</P>
<P>
Lancry told reporters later that the withdrawal would be
completed "in one phase" by July 7, 2000.
</P>
<P>
He said the pull-out will be in full accordance with Security
Council resolutions 425 and 426 (1978).
</P>
<P>
The resolutions, calling for immediate cease of Israeli
military action against Lebanese territorial integrity and
withdrawal of Israeli forces from all Lebanese territory, were
adopted after Israel's incursion into southern Lebanon against
Palestinian guerrillas in 1978.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has since deployed a 4,500 member peacekeeping force
in southern Lebanon. The Security Council is expected to discuss
the future of the force.

JOHANNESBURG, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe unreservedly
invites anyone who wants to observe its coming general election to
do so, Zimbabwean Parliament Speaker Cyril Ndebele said in Cape
Town on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government wants the election process to be as

parliament's legitimacy, he told a Southern African Development
Community (SADC) Parliamentary Forum in South African National
Assembly.

In terms of Zimbabwe's constitution, the poll has to be held
within four months after Zimbabwean parliament was dissolved on
April 13.

<P>
The delimitation board said it needs at least three months to
do its work, but the relevant government officials believed it can
be done sooner, Ndebele said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that his country supports all initiatives of the forum
to observe elections in the SADC region and has participated in
such teams in other countries.

According to earlier reports, South African National Assembly
Speaker and chairwoman of the parliamentary forum Frene Ginwala

<HEADLINE> Foreign Residents in Japan Protest Ishihara's Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Three groups of foreign residents
in Kobe, southwestern Japan, on Monday jointly sent a letter to
Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara, protesting against his recent
discriminatory remarks against foreigners living in Japan, Kyodo
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Nationalist Ishihara told members of Japan's Ground Self-
Defense Force on April 9 that Japanese troops should be prepared
for riots by foreigners after a major earthquake in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Ishihara's remarks "were unforgivable as it is a serious
challenge to people who hope for peace and friendship," the letter
said.
</P>
<P>
The three groups are the general association of overseas
Chinese in Kobe, the Hyogo Prefecture headquarters of the Korean
Residents Union in Japan (Mindan) and the Hyogo prefectural
chapter of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (
Chongryun).
</P>
<P>
Citing the January 1995 earthquake that devastated Kobe and
adjacent cities, the letter said foreign residents were involved
in helping out each other during the disaster.
</P>
<P>
The letter strongly demanded that Ishihara retract his remarks
and change his discriminatory views against non-Japanese groups.
</P>
<P>
"The three groups have been making efforts to live together
with the Japanese people. We feel indescribable indignation
against the remarks," said Rin Doshun, president of the Chinese
association.
</P>
<P>
"We feel the past five years of efforts we've been making after
the earthquake has been wasted," said Kim Hyo, deputy chief of
Mindan's Hyogo prefectural headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Li Mun I, chief of Chongryun's Hyogo prefectural chapter, said,
"The remarks were unforgivable for all Koreans in Japan."
</P>
<P>
On April 9, Ishihara said: "Atrocious crimes have been
committed again and again by 'sangokujin' and other foreigners who
have illegally entered Japan. We can expect them to riot in the
event of a disastrous earthquake."
</P>
<P>
"Sangokujin" literally means "people from third countries." The
term gained currency after World War II for referring to people
from the former Japanese colonies in Taiwan and the Korean
Peninsula. It is now widely regarded as a derogatory term.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Russian president-elect
Vladimir Putin said on Monday that he had held good talks with
British Prime Minister Tony Blair, but also made clear that
Russian political and public opinion was very different from that
in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the situation in Chechnya, Putin told a joint
press conference with Blair that he can not agree with Blair on
the alleged human rights abuses committed by Russian troops in the
breakaway Russian republic.
</P>
<P>
"We certainly have very different positions," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
But Putin added that he agreed to Blair's suggestion to
establish a committee to study and investigate the alleged human
rights problems in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Blair said he had raised his concerns over Russia's
tough policy on Chechnya with Putin. But he stressed that he did
not want to isolate Moscow on the issue.
</P>
<P>
"Some say that because of our concerns about Chechnya we should
keep some distance from Moscow. I have to tell you that while I
share those concerns, I believe that the best way to register
those concerns and to get results is by engaging with Russia and
not isolating Russia." Blair said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said he welcomed Putin's commitment in a
statement last week that all reports of human rights violations in
Chechnya would be investigated.

<HEADLINE> China's Traditional Industries Urged to Embrace E-commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua)-- Internet entrepreneurs have urged
Chinese traditional industries to start electronic commerce as
soon as possible to keep up with the burgeoning electronic economy.
</P>
<P>
"Many people believe that the ".com" economy is a bubble
economy which they need not concern themselves with," said Wang
Juntao, president of the 8848.com website. "My view is that
without starting electronic commerce, traditional businesses will
be not be able to survive."
</P>
<P>
Wang, speaking at the World Economic Forum's "China Business
Summit 2000", pointed out that Chinese traditional businesses are
still not psychologically ready for the advent of e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
After trade barriers disappear along with China's entry into
WTO, e-commerce is likely to emerge as the new trade barrier for
those who have not already converted. Richard Li, chairman of Hong
Kong Pacific Century Group, said that all companies should think
of e-commerce as a way to readjust to the new economy.
</P>
<P>
Business leaders at the conference reached a consensus that
information technology not only affects business operations and
company-to-company trade, but can also promote new industries.
</P>
<P>
Charles Zhao Chaoyang, president of Sohu company, many
traditional businesses are closely watching e-commerce develop in
China because they are yet to be exposed to fierce competition. In
the long run, Chinese companies will realize that foreign
companies will be their major competitors. In this respect,
traditional industries must strive towards developing e-commerce
to raise their competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Wang Juntao said that many multinationals choose e-commerce as
one of the prerequisites when looking for local partners in China.
The reason why the 8848 website's volume of trade has skyrocketed
in the eight months of operation is because many multinationals
have paired up with it.
</P>
<P>
He said that e-commerce is not just about selling things on the
net. The most crucial thing for companies is to realize the huge
potential of e-commerce. Chinese electric appliance companies such
as Kelon, are now at the forefront of e-commerce development, Wang
added.

<HEADLINE> China Prepares For A "Second Stock Market" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- China has fully prepared for the
establishment of a "second stock market", Zhou Xiaochuan, chairman
of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), said here
today.
</P>
<P>
"When legal conditions are ripe and all the technical problems
are solved, China will set up a second stock market as soon as
possible," said Zhou, who is attending a three-day China Business
Summit in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
China will unveil top eight major underwriters to improve
their operation level. "However, selected underwriters are not
entitled to any privileges," Zhou pointed out. China now has 23
securities companies which are qualified as major underwriters in
China.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhou, CSRC passed a bill recently to encourage
underwriters to handle commission and dealings via the Internet.
On-line securities transactions only accounted for a meager one
percent of the total stock dealings.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China has improved its stock issuance systems to
promote the healthy development of the securities market. For
example, the issuance quota of shares and the administrative
interference in issuance prices have been abolished, he said.
</P>
<P>
As for concerns about domestic Internet companies listing
abroad, Zhou said that China encourages all kind of enterprises to
accumulate fund through selling stocks. The CSRC will give more
support to promote the Internet industry in China.

<HEADLINE> HK Should Also Adhere to "One China Principle," Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 17 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the Office of
the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) stressed Monday that
one China principle should be adhered to in Hong Kong as well
since it is part of Chinese territory.
</P>
<P>
"After Hong Kong's return to China, the Central People's
Government and its organs stationed in Hong Kong have firmly
implemented the policies of 'one country, two systems', 'Hong Kong
people governing Hong Kong' and a high degree of autonomy, have
strictly acted in accordance with the Basic Law and have refrained
from interfering in affairs within the high degree of autonomy
enjoyed by Hong Kong," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a fact widely acknowledged by the international
community," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"Press freedom in Hong Kong is guaranteed by the Basic Law," he
said. "And the one China principle should be adhered to in Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region as well since Hong Kong is part
of Chinese territory. It is inappropriate and not right to
advocate and disseminate views of independence for Taiwan," the
spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong affairs are the internal matter of China in which no
foreign country should interfere," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made the remarks while responding to reporters on
the statements by the U.S. State Department and the British
Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Office spokesmen, saying that
they were "dismayed" or "very concerned" over the remarks of Wang
Fengchao, deputy director of the Central Government Liaison Office
in HKSAR, on the Hong Kong media coverage of the question of
Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> HK Gov't Consistently Supporting One China Principle, Tung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Tung Chee Hwa stressed
Monday that the SAR government has consistently supported
reunification according to the principle of "One China" and "One
Country, Two Systems."
</P>
<P>
Recently, the question of media reports on Taiwan has led to
concern among certain quarters of the community about press
freedom, Tung said at a media session at the Government House
Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In reality, Hong Kong's press freedom, freedom of speech and
freedom of publication are protected by the Basic Law, he said,
adding that media can continue to act in accordance to the laws of
Hong Kong. Ever since the transition, press freedom has been fully
protected and respected in Hong Kong, he said.
</P>
<P>
"As Chief Executive, I shall continue to implement the Basic
Law which protects the freedom of the press. About Taiwan's
independence, the SAR government has consistently supported
reunification according to the principle of 'One China' and 'One
Country, Two Systems'," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
He said that as a Chinese, it is his strong desire to see the
early reunification of the country. He said he believed that this
is also the hope of the majority of the Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
"What we really need to understand is what effect 'Taiwan's
independence' might have on cross-strait relationship, on the
mainland and Taiwanese economies, on Sino-U.S. relations and on
the stability of Asia-Pacific generally, and if these impacts are
adverse, what would the effect be on the investment environment in
Hong Kong and also on our economic recovery," Tung noted.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, in the months and years ahead, we must realize that
the issue of 'Taiwan's independence' is closely related to our own
self interest in Hong Kong," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that he has every confidence that Hong Kong will
continue to successfully implement 'One Country, Two Systems' and
that in itself is the best way in contributing towards the
reunification of the country.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet to Block Freeing Lebanese Detainees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak will convene a special cabinet session on Tuesday to discuss
the way to block the release of 13 Lebanese administrative
detainees now in custody in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was issued Monday afternoon by Barak's office
after Israel's Supreme Court rejected the appeal against the
release earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
The ruling once seemed to clear the way for the transfer of
these detainees to the International Red Cross organization in
south Lebanon, which was originally due to take place on Monday.
</P>
<P>
But now there will be no new date set for the release before the
cabinet session.
</P>
<P>
Barak's statement said the decision to call a cabinet meeting
was reached after a consultation with Justice Minister Yossi
Beilin, Interior Minister Natan Sharansky, Knesset (parliament)
Speaker Avraham Burg, Attorney-General Elyakim Rubinstein and
defense establishment officials.
</P>
<P>
It also stated that Barak is leaning toward supporting
legislation that would authorize the executive branch, rather than
the judicial branch, to be responsible for determining the holding
of "enemy fighters" for a period of time for the purpose of
redeeming Israeli missing serviceman.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the speaker informed Barak that the Knesset, which is
currently in recess for the Jewish Passover Holiday, will convene
in special session on Tuesday to facilitate the discussion and the
passing of legislation regarding the Lebanese detainees.
</P>
<P>
Israel's prison authority announced last Wednesday that the 13
hostages would be set free following a ruling by the Supreme Court,
which ordered immediately release of eight of them because they
have been illegally kept for years as bargaining chips for missing
Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The family of Israel Air Force navigator Ron Arad, the most
famous among the Israeli soldiers missing in Lebanon since 14 years
ago, submitted a petition on Sunday to block the planned transfer.
</P>
<P>
However, the court upheld its ruling on Monday, saying Israeli
law does not give the defense ministry the authority to hold these
Lebanese citizens in administrative detention as they are not
presenting threats to Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
All these Lebanese hostages are used by Israel as bargaining
cards for information or return of missing Israeli servicemen. Most
of them were detained without trial for over a decade.
</P>
<P>
Since the Supreme Court ruling was announced, senior members of
the defense and judicial establishment have put forward proposals
to explore the possibility of legal ways to bypass it.
</P>
<P>
They are aiming at a law that will justify detaining citizens of
an enemy country as prisoner of wars for the duration of the
conflict, in accordance with the international law.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Likud party and the ultraorthodox religious Shas
party, which hold 19 and 17 crucial seats in the 120-member Knesset
respectively, have already announced they will vote in favor of
such a legislation.
</P>
<P>
However, Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami had told Israel
Radio that the court's "brave" decision to release the 13 prisoners
should be upheld, adding that keeping these hostages would not
bring back Israel's missing soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Arab Knesset Member Ahmed Tibi also condemned talks of a bypass
law, arguing that the state does not have a "moral right" to demand
the release of Jews imprisoned in Iran when it now tries to deprive
the Lebanese citizens of their basic rights.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Congressman Regrets For Iraq's Humanitarian Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Democratic Party Congressman
Tony Hall said here on Monday that he feels regret for the "
miserable" humanitarian situation in Iraq, which has been under
sweeping U.N. sanctions since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Hall made the remarks while visiting a hospital in Mansour
district of the Iraqi capital, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The director of the hospital briefed Hall on the dilapidated
conditions of the hospital, where many patients can not get timely
treatment because of the dire dearth of medicine and medical
equipments.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Hall held talks with Iraqi Health Minister
Umid Medhat Mubarak, who elaborated Hall on Iraq's present
humanitarian situation characterized by mounting mortality rates
and increasing occurrences of cancer and infectious diseases, the
INA said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Mubarak stressed that the U.S. and British
delegates at the U.N. Sanctions Committee put on hold contracts
Iraq signed with foreign countries within the framework of the U.N.
oil-for-food program to buy humanitarian goods such as food and
medicine.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly accused the United States and Britain of
deliberately impeding the implementation of the United Nations oil-
for-food deal, worsening the humanitarian crisis in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has claimed that over 1.5 million people, mostly children
and the elderly, have died as a direct result of the decade-long
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Hall arrived here Sunday evening by land from the Jordanian
capital of Amman.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival, Hall said his visit to Iraq, the first by an
American congressmen since the 1991 Gulf War which ended Iraq's
months-long occupation of Kuwait, is not political but
humanitarian.
</P>
<P>
During his four-day visit, Hall will visit schools, hospitals
and other facilities in Baghdad and the southern part of Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Britain, India to Pursue Dialogue on Nuclear Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The British foreign secretary, who is on a four-day visit to
India, told a joint press conference that officials from both
sides would meet soon to pursue a formal bilateral dialogue on non-
proliferation and disarmament.
</P>
<P>
He also declared that Britain saw India as a "natural contender
" for permanent membership of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Reflecting a wide convergence of views on almost all issues,
Cook said Britain and India were "natural partners" who should
base their new partnership on the foundations of being two
modernizing countries."
</P>
<P>
He announced that Britain would be opening two new trade
offices in India in Ahmedabad and Hyderabad and planned to
increase development aid to India from 100 million to 150 million
pounds (about 156 million to 234 million U.S. dollars) per year
over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Labeling both Britain and India as leading nations in
information technologies and software exports, the British Foreign
Secretary said both the governments are committed to keeping the
countries at the front of the knowledge-based global economy.
</P>
<P>
On the Kashmir issue, he said that sanctity of the Line of
Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir should be respected and called
for an end to violence in Jammu and Kashmir and said the only way
forward was through dialogue and creating "positive political
conditions" in the region.
</P>
<P>
Stating "serious dialogue required real restraint," Cook said
violence could only make problems worse.
</P>
<P>
He said restraint and confidence building measures were
required to reduce tension in the area.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Indian External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh said
he had held detailed bilateral talks with Cook and the talks were
"very constructive."
</P>
<P>
He said that the two sides had taken a decision to revive Indo-
U.K. Defense Consultative Group and that its fifth meeting would
be held in August.
</P>
<P>
He also indicated that Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee had
extended an invitation to his British counterpart Tony Blair to
visit India. "We look forward to an early visit. The exact dates
will be decided soon," he added.

MANILA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Presidential Palace
Monday distanced itself from the alleged bribery of congressmen in
the House of Representatives, as Press Secretary Ricardo Puno
denied Palace involvement.
</P>
<P>
Noting the separation of the executive branch from the
legislature,Puno told reporters that the president's office had no
knowledge of the alleged bribery of solons with half a million
pesos (12,500 U.S.dollars) each for passing the Omnibus Power Bill
on April 12.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the incident, the executive branch had told the
congress to prioritize the bill's passage, due to the insistence
of the country's overseas financial donors like the Asian
Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
Two solons claimed on Sunday that they were each given 500,000
pesos after a marathon House session last week. The session was
meant to pass the power bill before the legislature's Holy Week
recess late April.
</P>
<P>
The said bill mandates the sale of the National Power
Corporation to various private power companies, while its 500-
billion-peso (12.5 billion dollars) debt will be transferred to
the government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Senator Rodolfo Biazon questioned the motive of the
two solons for making the disclosure, but urged the National
Bureau of Investigation and the Office of the Ombudsman to
investigate the alleged bribe try.

<HEADLINE> Girls Status Unimproved in S. Asia: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The status of girls in South
Asian countries has not seen much improvement in the last decade
despite of efforts towards this end, said experts at a seminar
held here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Although governments and non-governmental organizations in
South Asia have made efforts to promote the rights of girls in the
region, the fundamental gender inequities still exist among most
of the population, said Nigel Fisher, regional director of the
UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund) at the seminar organized
by the South Asia Partnership International.
</P>
<P>
"Huge gender disparities exist in most countries in the region,
which can be termed as the least gender-sensitive region in the
world," said Fisher.
</P>
<P>
"We have the highest percentage of malnourished girls, the
lowest female literacy rate and the lowest percentage of girls in
schools," he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, girls in South Asia start to work earlier, become at
increasingly higher risk of violence and exploitation inside and
outside the home, fisher added.
</P>
<P>
Echoing the same view, Minister of State for Women and Social
Welfare of Nepal Kamala Panta said children and women in South
Asia are the marginalized groups living in difficult circumstances.
</P>
<P>
The discrimination between boys and girls begins from birth and
magnifies as they grow, Panta said.
</P>
<P>
Girls have unequal access to schools and many of them are
victims of sexual exploitation, she added.
</P>
<P>
To improve the present unpleasant situations for girls, Fisher
stressed the need to demand accountable leadership at all levels
of governments in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
He said there is a pressing need for legislation and laws to
ensure the rights of women and girls and to provide them with
adequate legal protections.
</P>
<P>
Fisher also appealed for resource allocations for programs
targeted to the education, health and well-being of girls.
</P>
<P>
Attending the two-day seminar are about 30 representatives from
governmental and non-governmental organizations in Canada, Sri
Lanka, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and Nepal, who discussed the
conditions of girls in South Asia and proposed ways to promote
their status.

</P>
<P>
During the International Saloon of Food in Beijing, many French
small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are displaying their
products at the invitation of Carrefour.

Daniel Bernard, the president of Carrefour, has been engaged in
promoting exports by SMEs, first in countries like Brazil and
Argentina, and now in China, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Luc Chereau, director of Carrefour in China, said the

Carrefour estimates that 150 million people in China have
formed a new middle class of consumers whose annual income ranges
from 1,500 to 3,000 U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Israel Informs U.N. on Withdrawal From Southern Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy
said here on Monday that his country has formally informed United
Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan on its decision to pull its
troops out of southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"I have sent to the secretary general of the U.N. the letter
concerning the decision of the Israeli government to quit Lebanon,
" Levy told the press after a meeting with his French counterpart
Hubert Vedrine.
</P>
<P>
He said the withdrawal will be made in a manner so that it will
be accepted by all sides involved.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine said France still wishes that such a pullout be made
within the framework of a peace agreement between Israel and two
of its Arab neighbors -- Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
He also warned Israel that some people may take advantage of
the pullout to "create a situation of insecurity."
</P>
<P>
Israel has invited France to participate in a U.N. peacekeeping
operation in southern Lebanon once the pullout is done.
</P>
<P>
France is now discussing with both Israel and the U.N. the
working of such a peacekeeping operation, which will include the
transformation of the role of the U.N. Intermediary Force for
Lebanon which has been installed in Lebanon since 1979.
</P>
<P>
France is also considering receiving some members of the pro-
Israel South Lebanon Army and their families as refugees after the
Israeli pullout.

<HEADLINE> What Is Going On in Tibet's Prisons (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- "Though it is not as free as the
outside, but beating, scolding and torturing prisoners are totally
forbidden in the prison," said Keni, who is serving a life
imprisonment at the Tibet Autonomous Regional Prison.
</P>
<P>
He added: "I can freely exercise my religious beliefs."
</P>
<P>
Keni is sentenced to life imprisonment for his intentionally
injuring others which leads to the death of a man.
</P>
<P>
Just like other prisoners, he participates in all the
activities arranged by the prison administration, such as learning
to knit cushions.
</P>
<P>
Everyday after the supper, Keni is free to read newspapers,
magazines and books, listen to the radio, watch TV or play chess.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, prisoners are treated in a humanitarian way,"
commented Kapil Sibal, chairman of the working group for random
detention from the United Nations, when he visited the prison two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Norbu, an official in charge of the prison, said that there
have been much improvement. A playground and a dining hall have
been built, musical instruments are bought and the quality of food
has increased, Norbu added.
</P>
<P>
According to regulations, each prisoner may have 20 kilograms
of grain, five kilograms of meat and 15 kilograms of vegetables
per month, in addition to a certain amount of tea, ghee and other
non-staple food. Their annual board wages are 1,800 yuan (about
216.86 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Keni said, prisoners manage the canteen themselves on a
democratic basis, and they decide what they want to eat.
</P>
<P>
What is different between Keni and other prisoners is that he
teaches the Tibetan language on Saturdays and Sundays, since he
used to be a Tibetan language teacher at a local primary school.
</P>
<P>
Because of his good behavior, the prison authorities have
applied to local people's court for the reduction of Keni's prison
term.

Doctors at the prison said that they conducted regular medical
chick-ups for prisoners and have found that most of them are in
good health.
</P>
<P>
Prisoners who are very sick will be immediately sent to well-
equipped hospitals or be released on bail for medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
Prisoners are also allowed to reunions with their families
during traditional Tibetan festivals, Keni said.
</P>
<P>
Tibet has three prisons which include the Tibet Autonomous
Regional Prison, Lhasa Prison and Bomi Prison. They are
responsible for managing, educating and reforming 2,200 criminals.
</P>
<P>
At present, the number of criminals in local prisons accounts
for 0.9 per thousand of the region's total population.
</P>
<P>
Eighty percent of the prisoners have committed crimes such as
theft, robbery, corruption, murder, and intentionally injuring
others. Five per cent of crimes threaten the national security of
the nation.
</P>
<P>
Among all the prisoners, Tibetan criminals account for 76
percent, those of Han nationality and other ethnic groups, 24
percent. Women criminals make up 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Jamyang Rinchen, warden of the Lhasa Prison, said that the
regional government invests large amount of money in improving
facilities in local prisons every year.
</P>
<P>
He said that in 1999 alone, local government spent more than 7
million yuan (about 843,000 U.S. dollars) in installing new
facilities in cells, dining halls, bath rooms, playgrounds and
recreational centers.
</P>
<P>
Jamyang Rinchen said, prisoners seldom fight with east other
and there is few violations of disciplines in Lhasa Prison.

In addition, prisoners' relatives are invited to act as
supervisors to keep an eye on the activities of police, Losang
Geleg said.
</P>
<P>
He said, local prisons have opened various courses for the
purpose to eliminate illiteracy and implement primary compulsory
education among prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, prisoners are encouraged to learn a certain skill
which enables them to compete for a job when they return to
society.
</P>
<P>
In Lhasa Prison, prisoners can participate in vegetable
planting, automobile repairs, cultivation of flowers, farming,
breeding domestic animals, processing stone materials, repairing
and building houses.
</P>
<P>
Prisoners there work four days a week and six hours a day.
Women prisoners only plant flowers and spin wool, which are not
heavy work.
</P>
<P>
The Tibet Autonomous Regional Prison and the Lhasa Prison both
have built teaching facilities. Losang Geleg said that they employ
a group of professional teachers and select some well-educated
prisoners to act as teachers in the prison-managed "Yuxin Schools".
They teach law, ethics, politics and culture.
</P>
<P>
Prisoners are also encouraged to take part in the examinations
and correspondence education programs launched by cultural and
technical schools. Many of them have obtained diplomas, and some
win prizes at the region's Tibetan calligraphy competition.
</P>
<P>
"I regard the prison term as a school semester," said Yong
Jianxi, a prisoner at the Tibet Autonomous Regional Prison. He
plans to learn and master a special skill and earn his own living
after his release from prison.

<HEADLINE> High-tech Development Attracts Overseas Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Development of high-tech
industry in China's central and western region is attracting more
and more overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
David Cohen, president and chief executive officer of
TransFiber Industry Holdings, Ltd. of the United States, said that
his company plans to build a wireless telecommunication network in
Henan Province, central China.
</P>
<P>
Cohen is attending a three-day Henan Economic and Trade Fair
which opened Sunday. He signed an agreement of cooperation with
local partners today.
</P>
<P>
Because the network is wireless, there is no need for the
construction of large-scale costly infrastructure facilities, said
Cohen, noting that such project is suitable to China's western
region.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said that with the introduction of new technology people
can watch cable TV, make long distance calls and browse on the
Internet without optical fiber cable.
</P>
<P>
High-tech programs account for more than 50 percent of all Sino-
overseas joint projects at the fair.
</P>
<P>
Li Kam Chung, chairman and chief executive officer of Seven
Star International Holding Inc. of Hong Kong, is also interested
in the high-tech development in the central and western regions of
the country.
</P>
<P>
He has introduced 10 advanced high-tech projects to Henan since
the beginning of the year. Plasma technology for disposing of
garbage won an authentication certificate issued by UN Secretary
General Kofi Annan in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Henan Province has worked out preferential policies which
encourage overseas investors to pour more money into its
electronic technology, bio-science and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Provinces of Shaanxi, Sichuan and Guizhou, and Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region have also issued similar policies over the past
month.
</P>
<P>
However, experts say that China should avoid the import of high-
tech products which have been phased out by foreign countries or
are harmful to the environment. They also stressed the necessity
to foster high quality high-tech personnel.

In a letter to the Science and Technology Daily, Ding Zhongli,
head of Institute of Geology and Geophysics of the Chinese Academy
of Sciences (CAS), and Liu Dongsheng, geologist and CAS scholar,
said that dust storm research is an urgent task for the whole
nation.
</P>
<P>
The Science and Technology Daily quoted the two scientists as
saying that the dust storm could only be curbed after monitoring
regular the patterns of dust storms
</P>
<P>
The occurrence and process of dust storms should also be a
major research program with the help of remote sensing data, they
said.
</P>
<P>
The frequent occurrence of the dust storms in northern China
was also felt in the southern parts of China. The civil aviation
and communications departments were all affected.
</P>

<P>
They said large amount of dust in the atmosphere from arid
areas in central Asia moved to the Loess Plateau and northern
Pacific areas.
</P>
<P>

from the arid areas by wind and loess accumulation over a long
period of time.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Meets Egyptian Counterpart Hosni Mubarak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALEXANDRIA (Egypt), April 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin met here Monday with his Egyptian counterpart Hosni Mubarak
and exchanged views on bilateral relations and issues of mutual
interest.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak welcomed and thanked Jiang for coming to Alexandria for
the meeting at his invitation.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, who had visited China seven times, said he treasures
the relations with China, and expressed hope to visit China again
in the future.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he was very glad to meet Mubarak again, one year
after their last meeting in China. He thanked Mubarak for inviting
him to Egypt and meet in the world famous historic city of
Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
The name of Alexandria, Jiang noted, was the first of an African
city to be known to the Chinese. In as early as 120 B.C., envoys of
the then Han Dynasty of China have arrived in Alexandria, which is
a witness to the historic relations between China and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak spoke highly of the developments in bilateral relations,
hailing the achievements of China's reform and open policy, which
he said have been the focus of world attention. The field of future
cooperation between the two countries will be even wider, he said.
</P>
<P>
China has gained experience in establishing special economic
zones and development zones, Mubarak said, adding that Egypt is
willing to draw from China's experience in establishing special
economic zones.
</P>
<P>
Both China and Egypt adopt the market economy, he said,
welcoming Chinese enterprises to expand investments in Egypt as
well as boost the mutually beneficial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said that Egypt, with its ancient civilization and rich
tourist resources, warmly welcomes tourists from China.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said there has been excellent development of relations
between Egypt and China, and Egypt will continue its firm pursuit
of the "One China" policy and support China's reunification strive.
</P>
<P>
He said Egypt supports and welcomes China's early entry into the
World Trade Organization. Jiang expressed his appreciation of the
Egyptian stances.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said that Sino-Egyptian relations can be
summed up as "mutual understanding, deep friendship and
comprehensive cooperation."
</P>
<P>
"We are full of confidence that our good relations will continue
into the future," he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that the world is undergoing profound changes
-- multipolarization has become an irreversible trend and economic
globalization has been growing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, there has been an ease of the overall
international situation, which is helpful to the settlement of some
regional hot-spot questions; but on the other, the very existence
of hegemonism and power politics causes instability in the world,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, it becomes especially necessary and
important for China and Egypt, as important developing countries,
to solidify unity and cooperation in order to confront challenges
and seek common development.
</P>
<P>
"Since the two countries forged strategic cooperative
relationship a year ago, we have witnessed growing exchanges,
closer coordination and deepened cooperation," Jiang said. "We
expect this trend to continue," he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang and Mubarak exchanged views on beefing up cooperation in
trade, and science and technology. Jiang said that bilateral trade
has been growing fast in recent years, indicating there is great
potential in this field.
</P>
<P>
"I am interested in the development of Egypt's Suez Gulf Special
Economic Zone," Jiang said, "the Chinese side is willing to
cooperate with the Egyptian side in this project."
</P>
<P>
"It is China's set foreign policy to consolidate and develop the
long-term, friendly cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed belief that, through joint efforts, the friendly
cooperation between the two countries will further develop in depth
and that new growth points will keep arising in bilateral economic
and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that with the development of China's economy, more and
more Chinese travel abroad. "We believe that a growing number of
Chinese tourists will come to Egypt," he added.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak briefed Jiang on the latest developments of the Middle
East peace talks, especially on the Palestinian and Syrian tracks,
and Egypt's stance as well.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said his visits to Israel and Palestine come at a time
when major changes are taking place in the situation in the Middle
East region.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed the hope that his visits and contacts with
parties concerned would help push forward the peace march.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that during his talks with Israeli and Palestinian
leaders, they all briefed him on the current situation in the peace
talks and their respective stances on the peace-making.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said he emphasized on China's positions to
both sides:
</P>
<P>
First, to achieve reconciliation between Arabs and Jews, and
peace in the Middle East, is an inevitable trend of history. Such a
trend not only serves the interests of the people of all countries
in the region, but also contributes to world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, China upholds its traditional thinking of "Peace is
the best policy." The settlement of the Middle East issue lies in
peaceful negotiations rather than force, in cooperation rather than
confrontation, and in mutual understanding and tolerance rather
than mutual hostility and exclusion.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, the Arab-Israeli talks should be based on the relevant
U.N. resolutions and adhere to the "land-for-peace" principle. The
two
sides should conduct talks in an earnest and practical manner in
the spirit that "Do not do to others what you don't want to be done
to you." The two sides should implement all signed agreements so as
to build up mutual trust and overcome difficulties and obstacles to
advance the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Fourthly, the Middle East peace process should be aimed at
respecting territorial integrity and sovereignty of all the
countries in the region, safeguarding their national security,
restoring the legitimate rights of Palestinian people, including
their rights to establish an independent state, and enabling all
nations to live in harmony.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that all the parties concerned appeared willing and
determined to speed up the peace talks. However, they are faced
with lots of difficulties, which entail intensified efforts from
the international community that has the responsibility as well as
obligation to exert.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is an important country in the region and has been playing
a unique role in pushing forward the Middle East peace talks, Jiang
said, adding that the more difficulties and obstacles there are in
the Middle East peace talks, the more important role Egypt plays.
</P>
<P>
"China appreciates and supports Egypt, especially Your
Excellency (Mubarak), in the efforts to continue to play an active
and key role in the peace process," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to continue consultations with Egypt on the
issue, strengthen coordination, and make joint efforts to realize a
comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the talks were Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen,
State Councillor Wu Yi, Egyptian Prime Minister Atef Obeid,
Minister of Defense and Military Production Mohammed Tantawi,
Minister of Foreign Affairs Amr Moussa, Interior Minister Habib el-
Adli, Minister of Economy and Foreign Trade Youssef Ghali.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Mubarak held a banquet in honor of the Chinese
president.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made this special trip to Alexandria to meet Mubarak
following visits to Israel and Palestine within a five-nation tour.
He will travel on to visit Turkey, Greece and South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Backs Pakistan to Boost Defense Capability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary-General Esmat
Abdel Meguid on Monday stressed Pakistan's legitimate right to
strengthen its defense capability.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot imagine that Pakistan has hostile intentions that
may threaten any country in the region," Meguid said in a statement
following his meeting with visiting Pakistani Chief Executive
Pervez Musharaf here.
</P>
<P>
He said that there are certain international systems and
regulations that govern the armament process, which Pakistan has
already recognized.
</P>
<P>
He added that his meeting with Musharaf covered the current
challenges facing the Arab and Islamic worlds, especially certain
campaigns against Islam.
</P>
<P>
These campaigns are completely unacceptable as Islam is the
religion of tolerance, Meguid pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He said that he also discussed with Musharaf ways of cooperation
in order to enhance the relations between the Arab League and the
Organization of Islamic Conference.
</P>
<P>
Musharaf is keen on this kind of cooperation between the two
organizations in the light of the memorandum of understanding
signed between them, said Meguid.
</P>
<P>
Musharaf arrived here on Saturday for a three-day visit to
Egypt. He has already held talks with President Hosni Mubarak,
Prime Minister Atef Obeid and other Egyptian senior officials.

<HEADLINE> HK Gov't Consistently Supporting One China Principle, Tung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Tung Chee Hwa stressed
Monday that the SAR government has consistently supported
reunification according to the principle of "One China" and "One
Country, Two Systems."
</P>
<P>
Recently, the question of media reports on Taiwan has led to
concern among certain quarters of the community about press
freedom, Tung said at a media session at the Government House
Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In reality, Hong Kong's press freedom, freedom of speech and
freedom of publication are protected by the Basic Law, he said,
adding that media can continue to act in accordance to the laws of
Hong Kong. Ever since the transition, press freedom has been fully
protected and respected in Hong Kong, he said.
</P>
<P>
"As Chief Executive, I shall continue to implement the Basic
Law which protects the freedom of the press. About Taiwan's
independence, the SAR government has consistently supported
reunification according to the principle of 'One China' and 'One
Country, Two Systems'," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
He said that as a Chinese, it is his strong desire to see the
early reunification of the country. He said he believed that this
is also the hope of the majority of the Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
"What we really need to understand is what effect 'Taiwan's
independence' might have on cross-strait relationship, on the
mainland and Taiwanese economies, on Sino-U.S. relations and on
the stability of Asia-Pacific generally, and if these impacts are
adverse, what would the effect be on the investment environment in
Hong Kong and also on our economic recovery," Tung noted.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, in the months and years ahead, we must realize that
the issue of 'Taiwan's independence' is closely related to our own
self interest in Hong Kong," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that he has every confidence that Hong Kong will
continue to successfully implement 'One Country, Two Systems' and
that in itself is the best way in contributing towards the
reunification of the country.

<HEADLINE> Filipino Terrorists Given Ultimatum to Free Captives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- A local Philippine leader issued
Monday an ultimatum to Abu Sayyaf terrorists, urging them to free
all their hostages until the end of April, otherwise he will
personally lead an all-out assault against them.
</P>
<P>
Wahab Akbar, governor of Basilan province in the southern
Philippines, said in a statement that he has on standby some 500
fully-armed civilians ready to initiate assault at the extremists'
camp if government negotiations fail.
</P>
<P>
"This is an ultimatum, it's either the rebels free all hostages
or face an all-out assault. We will not tolerate terrorism in the
province anymore," Akbar said.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf, which abducted more than 50 hostages in Basilan
province in March, continues to keep 29 civilians hostage and has
reportedly given the Philippine government a one-week deadline to
meet its demands.
</P>
<P>
Abu Sayyaf leader Khaddafy Janjalani sent Philippine President
Joseph Estrada a list of demands last Friday, including the
release of suspected terrorists, stopping the display of Christian
crosses in Sulu, Basilan and Tawi-Tawi, and the removal of all
foreign fishing vessels in the waters of these three provinces.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Armed Forces spokesman Rafael Romero said the
military is taking its steps to address the hostage situation.
</P>
<P>
"The primordial concern is the safety of all the hostages, but
we are not ruling out military action against the Abu Sayyaf,"
Romero said.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have threatened to execute all hostages if the
government attempts a rescue.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia's Garment Exports Fall in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's top export earner,
the garment industry, is facing a hard year due to the impact of
quota and the factory strikes.
</P>
<P>
According to the figures released by the Commerce Ministry last
weekend, Cambodia exported 123.1 million U.S. dollars worth of
garments during the first three months of the year, down by 5
percent from the previous year's 129.6 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the decrease to a quota agreement with
the United States that limited the amount manufacturers were
allowed to export to the U.S. and workers' strikes which forced
some factories to close.
</P>
<P>
The figures show that garment exports to the U.S. have fallen
to 93.6 million U.S. dollars in the first quarter from 115.8
million dollars in the same period of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The quota, imposed by the U.S. in January, 1999, put ceilings
on 12 kinds of garment products. Many factories got only a small
share of quotas so they could not survive and those heavily
relying on the U.S. market were also suffering.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia has benefited from the special trade privileges from
the United States since 1996 and low tariffs provided under the
European Union's Generalized System of Preferences.

<HEADLINE> Johannesburg Stock Exchange Turns Weak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Johannesburg Stock
Exchange (JSE) looks set for further weakness this week with
portfolio managers and dealers bracing for continuing volatility
on fallout from the U.S. markets, a South African financial
analyst said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The JSE market may bottom out soon but there is little
likelihood of a sharp rebound this week ahead of the Easter
holidays as investors are still edgy over the fallout from the
U.S. technology meltdown, according to assistant general manager
of Amalgamated Bank of South Africa Asset Management Dion
Metcalfe.
</P>
<P>
"I expect more of the same this week. We have never seen these
kinds of volatilities before in the markets and I think there will
be more volatility linked to Wall Street," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wall Street's technology-led falls last Thursday smacked the
JSE to year lows last Friday as investors dumped equities, spooked
by turbulence that has stalked global markets recently.
</P>
<P>
The losses on JSE were overdone and the exchange is now looking
cheap after the market wiped nine percent off share prices over
the past two weeks, Metcalfe said.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Accepts Donation for Mozambican Flood Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
President Nelson Mandela Monday accepted one million rand (about
154,000 U.S. dollars) from Caltex Oil Company and 500 water
rollers from the Hippo Water Trust on behalf of the Mozambican
flood victims.
</P>
<P>
The donation ceremony was held at Mandela's home residence in
Houghton, Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of Caltex Oil South Africa Dana Flanders said the
company, which has operations in Mozambique, is happy to help the
flood victims rebuild their lives.
</P>
<P>
"The Mozambicans are going through an enormous tragedy. We hope
our donation can help them recover in some way," Flanders said.
</P>
<P>
Regina Nzo, former Secretary General of the African National
Congress and wife of the late former Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo,
said on behalf of the Hippo Water Trust that the rollers could
hold 90 liters of water and could easily be pushed by a small
child.
</P>
<P>
"The rollers will save enormous amounts of time for rural
communities because they are rolled as opposed to being carried
in buckets on the head," Nzo said.
</P>
<P>
The non-profit trust has distributed the rollers on a
subsidized basis to 35 communities throughout Africa. More than
40,000 people have benefited from using them.
</P>
<P>
"The water roller is an exciting African Renaissance
innovation. It is an excellent example of how Africans can develop
solutions to African problems," she said.

LAGOS, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Vice President Atiku
Abubakar has cautioned against "land mines" strewn daily by some
dislocated interest groups to topple the nascent democracy in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian newspaper Monday quoted him as saying in the
eastern Enugu State that some "powerful people" behind the scene
are scared by the radical reforms of Olusegun Obasanjo
administration at sanitizing the country.
</P>
<P>
The reforms, he said, have made some former power monopolizers
to find it difficult to come to terms with the power shift in the
country.
</P>
<P>
He urged Nigerians not to fall for the antics of enemies of
democracy striving endlessly to truncate the country's hard-won
freedom.
</P>
<P>
"We should brace up for these challenges and face them
squarely," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Senator Femi Okurounmu also accused certain senators
of collaborating with outsiders to provoke the president not to
sign the two bills (that of Niger Delta Development Commission and
the 2000 budget), in order to prepare excuses for a possible
impeachment of the government.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 17 (Xinhua) -- African countries reached a
compromise agreement on ivory trade on Monday as South Africa
agreed to give up its request for an annual export quota of 30
tons of raw ivory.
</P>
<P>
However, at the ongoing 11th Conference of the Parties to the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in
Kenya's capital Nairobi, South African representatives still
demanded a transfer of its elephant population from CITES Appendix
I to Appendix II.
</P>
<P>
All species in CITES Appendix I are banned on trade while
species in Appendix II are regulated in trade under a strict
monitoring system. South Africa's elephant species being
downlisted to CITES Appendix II will be endorsed by the conference
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kenya and India also withdrew their proposal which
demanded the transfer of the elephant population in Botswana,
Zimbabwe and Namibia currently listed in Appendix II to Appendix
I.
</P>
<P>
At the conference, South Africa had demanded an annual ivory
export quota of 30 tons; Botswana, 12 tons; Namibia, two tons; and
Zimbabwe, 10 tons.
</P>
<P>
The elephant species in Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe are
already in Appendix II.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that South Africa can only put forward its
request for export ivory at the next CITES conference.

PARIS, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Indian President K.R. Narayanan is
on a five-day state visit to France, during which he will hold
talks with President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin.
</P>
<P>
The visit, which began Sunday, is the first by an Indian head
of state, and is in response to a visit by Chirac to New Delhi in
January 1998.
</P>
<P>
French officials said although no agreements are expected to be
signed during Narayanan's stay, the visit is putting new dynamism
into bilateral relations, which have been experiencing a full-
blown development over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
France and India established a regular system of "strategic
dialogue" two years ago and a permanent forum on bilateral
cooperation in all fields, which has already conducted four
meetings.
</P>
<P>
Trade between France and India now stands at 2 billion U.S.
dollars a year, which is relatively small considering the
potential of the two countries, said French officials.
</P>
<P>
The French aeronautics companies Aerospatiale-Matra and Airbus

For this reason, France will invite Narayanan to visit the

</P>
<P>
This supplementary food ration of oil and UNIMIX, a fortified
blend of soya and cornmeal, will be used in an emergency program

WASHINGTON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:

</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The steep drop last week in the price of technology stocks,
punctuating a three-week slide, may mark a turning point in

investors and entrepreneurs hoping to cash in quickly.
</P>

recognize a Palestinian state and a "down payment" on a future
transfer of land if Israel and the Palestinians reached a "
framework" final peace agreement by the end of May.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>

biggest point drops ever and among their steepest percentage
losses in a decade. Friday's consumer-price report indicated that
inflation may be resurfacing. The Nasdaq Composite Index dropped

<HEADLINE> EU Approves Humanitarian Aid for Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Monday that it has cleared a package of aid worth 6.5 million
euros (some 6.24 million U.S. dollars) for internally displaced
persons (IDPs) in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to carry out emergency aid projects as
well as projects to support community integration in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Conflict with guerrilla and paramilitary groups for control of
territory in Colombia's rural areas has escalated over the past
five years and led to a dramatic increase in the number of IDPs,
which is now estimated at over one million, said the commission,
the executive body of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Humanitarian organizations will work on a regional basis,
pooling their fields of competence in a joint effort to assist the
IDPs, the commission said in a statement. Aid will be provided to
assist the return and resettlement process.
</P>
<P>
It will include emergency assistance as well as help with
restoring IDPs' self-sufficiency through agricultural
rehabilitation activities or provision of psychological support.
</P>
<P>
"This assistance also intended to help rebuild Colombia's
social fabric and will involve local institutions in taking on
responsibility for IDPs," the Commission said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The funding will be arranged by the International Committee of
the Red Cross, the Spanish Red Cross, Oxfam UK and several non-
governmental organizations.

<HEADLINE> China's Power Sector Steps Up Technical Renovation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- China's power industry is
undergoing a large-scale technological innovation to control
pollution, increase economic benefit and guarantee safe operation,
said a senior official today.
</P>
<P>
China will by the end of this year complete the technological
innovation of 7.5-to-8 million kilowatt medium-and low-pressure
condenser-tube generating units which have been in operation for
at least 25 years, according to Zhou Xiaoqian, assistant president
of the China State Power Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The aim is to improve the capacity of the units to meet peak-
hour demands for power, increase safety, lower consumption of
energy and protect the environment.
</P>
<P>
Referring to energy consumption, the official said that coal
consumption in power plants in China will be reduced by an average
34 grams for generating a kilowatt hour of electricity by the end
of this year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, electricity voltage in major Chinese cities will
be up to standard at a rate of more than 95 percent, and the
reliability rate of power supply will reach more than 99 percent,
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that the power grids in China will
strengthen coordination in power supplies, so that the capacity of
the country's five major regional power grids and 15 provincial
power grids could reach international standards in the transfer
and control of power supplies.

<P>
The investment banks have also started online stock trading. It
is estimated that more than 20 investment banks have opened such
business.
</P>
<P>
Despite their increased capital, analysts, however, said China'
s investment banks are still too weak compared with their Western
counterparts, which often boast assets worth hundreds of billions
of dollars.
</P>
<P>
In practice, many investment banks now have publicly-listed
firms among their major shareholders. The above-mentioned Qinghai
Securities Co. even has 93 percent of its shares held by the
publicly-listed Qinghai Department Store Co.
</P>
<P>
Wu Xiaoqiu, head of the Financial and Securities Institute at
Renmin University, said that competition in China's investment
banking sector is still low, and large mergers and restructuring
has not yet taken off.
</P>
<P>
Wu predicted that in the coming decade, large mergers and
restructuring will greatly reduce the number of securities banks
in China and lead to the birth of super securities banks with
assets worth of tens or even hundreds of billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Urges Further Improvement of SOEs Efficiency (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo
called on State-owned enterprises (SOEs) to take concrete steps to
further restructure themselves and improve their management to lay
a solid foundation for their trans-century development.
</P>
<P>
During an study tour of Jiangxi and Hunan provinces from April
14 to 17, Wu said that the central government has mapped out
cardinal principle for SOEs' reform and development, which should
be implemented in a serious manner to ensure the realization of
the target of getting SOEs out of difficulties by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
"Efforts should be centered on optimizing structure, improving
quality and economic returns, and sharpening the competitive edge
of enterprises," he said.
</P>
<P>
More small factories and mines that are backward in technology,
poor in quality and serious in pollution should be shut down, and
the outdated equipment and technology eliminated, he pointed,
adding that the surplus production in some industries must be
reduced.
</P>
<P>
Greater effort should also be made in upgrading technology and
developing new products and technologies that meet market demand
and bring good economic benefits, while actively developing new
and high-tech industries, he said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Restructuring of China's Securities Sector (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- China's securities sector is
undergoing the second round of restructuring since the mid-1990s,
with companies racing to expand their equity capital, develop
online stocking trading and become China's first publicly-listed
investment banks.
</P>
<P>
The latest wave of equity capital expansion was triggered off
in May 1999 by the Xiangcai Securities Co. in Hunan Province,
which increased its capital from 100 million to one billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen investment banks have raised their capital or
have announced plans to do so. In the first four months of this
year alone, six investment banks announced capital expansion plans.
</P>
<P>
The wave has changed the strength of investment banks in term
of equity capital. The merger of Guotai and Jun'an, both in
Shanghai, established the largest investment bank, Guitai-Jun'an
Securities Co., with a registered capital of 3.7 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
China Communications Securities Co., formerly a relatively
small company, raised its capital to 2.2 billion yuan, ranking
second.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that altogether, investment banks total capital
increased by more than 10 billion yuan, which not only means
stronger investment banks, but also larger capital supply to the
stock market. The process has been accompanied by large scale
merger and restructuring in local securities sector, especially as
local trust and investment companies are involved, often with
encouragement from local governments and securities regulators.
</P>
<P>
For example, the merger of the Chongqing International Trust
and Investment Co. the Chongqing Securities Trading Center and two
other local securities companies produced the Southwest Securities
Co. the largest investment bank in southwest China, with
registered capital of one billion yuan.

"In the process of economic restructuring, market forces should
play a dominant role, and we should also rely on technological
progress and adopt new mechanism that meet the demand of socialist
market economy to promote the faster development of promising
industries and enterprises," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
He also called for further improvement of enterprise management,
saying that inefficient management is another major factor behind
the difficulties facing the SOEs.
</P>
<P>
He put special emphasis on the importance of improving
management of cost, capital and quality while calling for greater
effort to bring workers' enthusiasm and creativeness into full
play.
</P>
<P>
Concrete steps should be taken to establish and improve social
security system with Chinese characteristics, he said, adding that
this has a vital bearing on reform, development and stability.
</P>
<P>
Efficient measures must be adopted to ensure all SOEs' laid-off
and retired workers to get the full amount of living expenses and
pensions in time.
</P>
<P>
Wu also urged officials at all levels to further learn about
the living conditions of workers and help them get rid of
difficulties and ensure the stability of enterprises and the

BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Xiong Guangkai, deputy chief of
the General Staff of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) said today
that the Chinese government, the armed forces and people will
never sit idle if any force inside or outside Taiwan engages in
separatist activities.
</P>
<P>
Xiong made the remarks when he held talks with visiting Czech
First Deputy Defense Minister Jaromir Novotny here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Xiong said the guiding principle to resolving the Taiwan issue
is "peaceful reunification," and "one country, two systems."

</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the "one China" principle forms the basis
and prerequisite for peaceful reunification.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Macao's Land Area Expanding 0.64 sq.km. per Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The land area of Macao has been
increased from 17.71 sq. km. at the end of 1980s to 24.18 sq. km.
at the end of 1990s, at a speed of 0.64 sq. km. per year,
according to a joint research by scientists from China's mainland
and Macao region.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the expansion is the result of rapid economic
development of Macao from 1980s to 1990s, during which large-scale
seaside land reclamation was carried out.
</P>
<P>
The research, jointly conducted by Beijing-based prestigious
Qinghua University and Macao University, unveiled the close
relationship between economic growth and land expansion, and
indicated that future development of Macao still depends on
further land extension.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the land area of the peninsula only increased 5.04
sq. km. from 1912 to 1986, or 0.068 sq. km. a year during the 70-
odd years.
</P>
<P>
The research, supported by China's National Natural Science
Foundation, found that the mud and sand brought by the Pearl River
deposit at the western region of the river's mouth to sea,
offering abundant land resources for Macao's seaside land
reclamation.
</P>
<P>
Researchers also drew a digital map at a scale of 1:5000 for
Macao, and studied the change of the Macao's territory over the
past 100 years. The urban air pollution was also under the study
of the scientists.
</P>
<P>
The National Natural Science Foundation Committee recently
provided 425,000 yuan (about 51,000 US dollars) to support a joint
research by universities and institutes in the mainland and Macao
to find a solution to auto emission pollution control.

<P>
ALEXANDRIA (Egypt), April 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin met here Monday with his Egyptian counterpart Hosni Mubarak
and exchanged views on bilateral relations and issues of mutual
interest.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak welcomed and thanked Jiang for coming to Alexandria for
the meeting at his invitation.
</P>

him to Egypt and meet in the world famous historic city of
Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
The name of Alexandria, Jiang noted, was the first of an African

the then Han Dynasty of China have arrived in Alexandria, which is
a witness to the historic relations between China and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak spoke highly of the developments in bilateral relations,
hailing the achievements of China's reform and open policy, which
he said have been the focus of world attention. The field of future
cooperation between the two countries will be even wider, he said.
</P>
<P>
China has gained experiences in establishing special economic
zones and development zones, Mubarak said, adding that Egypt is
willing to draw from China's experiences in establishing special
economic zones.
</P>
<P>
Both China and Egypt adopt the market economy, he said,
welcoming Chinese enterprises to expand investments in Egypt as
well as boosting the mutually beneficial cooperation.

<HEADLINE> 5 Israelis Convicted in Maccabiah Bridge Disaster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Five Israelis were found guilty
in the case of the bridge collapse disaster in Israel during the
Maccabiah Games in 1997, an Israeli court announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
The five, who played key organizational roles in the games,
should be responsible for their negligence causing death and
injuries, said Tel Aviv Magistrate's Court. The defendants are
facing a maximum prison term of four years.
</P>
<P>
The tragedy took place on the occasion of the opening ceremony
of the 15th Maccabiah Games, the Jewish Olympics, on July 14, 1997,
in which four Australian Jewish athletes were killed and nearly
seventy injured.
</P>
<P>
When the Australians were crossing a temporary footbridge over
the Yarkon River into the Ramat Gan stadium near Tel Aviv, the
bridge collapsed and about 100 people were plunged into the
polluted river.
</P>
<P>
The engineer who designed the bridge, two sub-contractors, the
head of the Games' organizing committee, and the manager of the
Irgunit company which supplied materials for the bridge were
charged with causing death by negligence and building without
proper permits.
</P>
<P>
The trial officially began on January 20, 1998 and ended last
October. The court rendered its verdict on Monday after almost six
months' deliberation.
</P>
<P>
The victims of the bridge disaster also filed separate civil
complaints against 19 Israeli entities, including the state,
police, Maccabi Israel and the Ramat Gan Municipality, to seek
damages of more than one million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
An attorney representing the victims said that he believed a
guilty verdict in the criminal case would directly help speed up
the compensation claims in the civil suit, which is currently under
way in Tel Aviv District Court.

<HEADLINE> Only 2 percent of Poor Dhaka Citizens Support Hartal: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Only two percent of the poor city
dwellers support hartal (general strike) in principle as a means
of protest, according to a survey released here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The survey on "Hartal and the Poor of Dhaka City" was conducted
by a social survey unit of Democracy Watch from January 27 to 31
this year to ascertain the income loss of the poor city dwellers
during hartals and to look into their overall perceptions on
hartal.
</P>
<P>
The survey said that moral support for hartal or support to any
political leader is very insignificant case for work stoppage,
suggesting a very low level of political affiliation of the poor
city dwellers.
</P>
<P>
On the alternative means of protest and political activity, 67
percent of the poor desire the parliament to be more effective as
the forum of political discussion while 21 percent of them support
meetings and processions as a vehicle of political protest by the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, most city dwellers do not support
hartal because they suffer most in terms of economic loss as well
as income loss, and they witness a lot of damage to their
properties during such political programs.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,000 poor dwellers of Dhaka city were interviewed
through a questionnaire as hartal has become pervasive in
Bangladesh, disrupting normal life with a telling effect on the
poor like rickshaw-pullers, day laborers, small shopkeepers and
slum dwellers.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Extremist Group Threatens to Kill Americans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Philippine extremist group Abu
Sayyaf threatened Monday to kill Americans in Mindanao in the
southern Philippines unless its demand for the release of three
Muslims jailed in the United States is met.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf, which abducted more than 50 hostages in March,
said in a statement that the U.S. government must release the
three Muslims jailed in America, including Ramzi Yousef, the
mastermind in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center in New
York.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. embassy to the Philippines made no comment to the
demand of the extremist group, but reminded the 100,000 Americans
living in the Philippines to refrain from traveling to Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Philippine President Joseph Estrada said he is
leaving to the crisis management committee (CMC) the matter of
dealing with the Abu Sayyaf for the safe release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf continues to keep 29 civilians hostage and has
reportedly given the Philippine government a one-week deadline to
meet its demands.
</P>
<P>
National Security Adviser Alexander Aguirre said the CMC
continues to exert efforts to convince the extremists to make
their demand reasonable.
</P>
<P>
Abu Sayyaf leader Khaddafy Janjalani sent President Estrada a
list of the group's demand last Friday, including the release of
suspected terrorists, stopping the display of Christian crosses in
Sulu, Basilan and Tawi-Tawi, and the removal of all foreign
fishing vessels in the waters of these three provinces.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Senator Rodolfo Biazon, for his part, urged the
country's Muslim leaders to use their power of persuasion in
convincing the Abu Sayyaf group to drop its irresponsible demand
and release the hostages.
</P>
<P>
By demanding the release of international terrorists Ramzi
Yousef, Abu Haider and Sheik Abdurahman Omar, Biazon said the Abu
Sayyaf is just trying to internationalize the hostage situation.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Oil Output Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The oil production in Pakistan
has risen from 55,128 barrels per day (bpd) to 65,100 bpd in the
recent weeks, showing an 18 percent increase, official sources
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The increase was the result of the effective efforts by the
present government, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The country's natural gas production has also been raised from
2,100 million cubic feet per day to 2,295 million cubic feet per
day.
</P>
<P>
Highlighting the achievements in the energy sector, the sources
said that for the first time in the history of Pakistan,
uninterrupted gas supply was maintained to consumers during the
winter months.
</P>
<P>
Energy is one of the four key sectors which the current
Pakistani government put special priority on. The government hopes
to accelerate the privatization process in the oil and gas sector
to promote domestic energy production and thus lessen the country'
s independence on imported petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
On the privatization process, the sources said parameters and
modalities for expeditious privatization of oil and gas sector
entities have been agreed upon with the Privatization Commission.
</P>
<P>
Besides, 11 new exploration licenses were recently granted to
five exploration companies over an area of 38,385 square km
against a commitment of investment of 108 million U.S. dollars
over a period of three years, the sources said.

NAIROBI, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Plans are under way to start a
new radio station to educate people about Lake Victoria, which
borders Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, the state-run Kenya Times
reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The station will be located at Dunga Beach in Kisumu, Nyanza
Province, southwest Kenya, said Obiero Onganga, chairman of
Osienala, a non- governmental organization which deals with
conservation of the lake.
</P>
<P>
According to Onganga, the station will help inform the 30
million people residing around the lake on issues such as
conservation, pollution and fishery.
</P>
<P>
The station will also sensitize the communities around the lake
on how to use and conserve it, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the problem of overfishing, trawling, fishing using
chemicals and disposal of raw sewage into the lake must be
addressed urgently.
</P>
<P>
Those caught using chemicals to harvest fish, which is
dangerous to both the lake and human beings, would be arrested and
prosecuted according to the law, he said.

LAGOS, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Lagos State is to take
the lead in the most populous African country to link the state's
public service to Internet, reported the Guardian, a leading
newspaper in Nigeria, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted State Governor Bola Tinubu as saying that the
move will make the state, which is the economic hub of the West
African nation, more efficient in managing its natural, financial
and human resources.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Nigeria must try to find its own place in an
era of information, technology and e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
Due to the poor state of its telecommunication infrastructure,
Internet is quite a new thing to the bulk of population in
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
About 95 percent of Lagos State's records are kept manually and
their storage facilities are often in an appalling state, Tinubu
said.
</P>
<P>
It is worrisome that "it takes months for information about new
 employment, leave from service, death or retirement of clerks
could be reflected on the payroll," the governor added.

LUANDA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Senegalese government denied
last weekend that its armed forces had entered into the
Guinea-Bissau territory in pursuit of Casamance separatist
guerrillas, local informed sources said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The denial came a day after the government of Guinea-Bissau
formally protested the bombing of a border region by "Senegalese
aviation". The action was reportedly carried out following
incidents across the frontier, in the southern Senegal's breakaway
Casamance Province.
</P>
<P>
Investigations have confirmed that "there was no violation of
Guinea- Bissau territory", said the Senegalese government in an
official note.
</P>

Meanwhile, Dakar has contacted Bissau to review the facts and
calm the situation, according to the Portuguese news agency Lusa.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last week, the Senegalese army reported that 18 people
(including three army soldiers) had been killed during clashes
with Casamance separatists in Kolda, near the Guinea-Bissau
border.

<P>
SEOUL, April 17 (Xinhua) -- South Korean stock markets suffered
record losses on "Black Monday" in the wake of the crash on Wall
Street at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) plummeted more
than 90 points just four minutes after the opening bell Monday
morning, prompting stock authorities to use a circuit breaker for
the first time to halt trading for 20 minutes for a cool-off.
</P>
<P>
The KOSPI lost more than 100 points for the first time before
closing the day at 707.72, down 93.17 points, or 11.63 percent.
</P>
<P>
The KOSPI saw trade volume total 287.7 million shares worth 2.
97 trillion won (2.66 billion U.S. dollars). The floor was
virtually empty in the afternoon with the key index tumbling by 11
percent.
</P>
<P>
Losers outnumbered gainers 837 against 45 with 266 falling by
daily lows.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the KOSDAQ market nosedived too, with seven out of
10 stocks falling by their daily lows.
</P>
<P>
The key index tumbled a record 11.4 percent, or 22.33 points,
to 173.54.
</P>
<P>
The KOSPI and KOSDAQ saw some 40 trillion won worth of market
capitalization vanished due to the crash in stock prices.
</P>
<P>
The KOSPI registered market capitalization of 252.8 trillion
won, down 32.1 trillion won from Friday while that of KOSDAQ
market was slashed by 7.5 trillion won to 107.18 trillion won.
</P>
<P>

Korean national budget for this year.
</P>
<P>
South Korean President Kim Dae-jung has instructed his cabinet
to map out measures to stabilize the faltering stock markets.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said some strong measures to protect the markets are
needed urgently as eventual collapse will be detrimental to the

PARIS, April 17 (Xinhua) -- French police Sunday arrested an
important militant of the Spanish Basque separatist group ETA in
the province of Pau in southwest France, according to local media.

Julia Moreno Macusto, 26, was arrested during a check on a

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's Kim Seeks Practical Outcomes From Inter-Korean Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 17 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
Monday stressed the importance of pursuing the inter-Korean summit
scheduled for June 12-14 in Pyongyang but expected only "practical
outcomes."
</P>
<P>
"We will deal with the matter without great desire and with
caution to seek practical outcomes," Kim said in a televised
speech to the nation.
</P>
<P>
At the forthcoming inter-Korean summit, Kim said he will focus
on economic cooperation, consolidation of peace, reunion of
separated families and the establishment of a permanent office for
inter-Korean cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Kim separated humanitarian aid from economic cooperation with
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), which is seen as
an indirect response to allegations that his government pledged
large-scale economic aid to the north in return for the summit.
</P>
<P>
Economic cooperation is being sought based on mutual interests
and reciprocity and will benefit both South Korea and the DPRK, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean president also made it clear that he will
pursue the summit on the basis of national consensus and
cooperation between the ruling and opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
In early April, South Korea and the DPRK reached an agreement
in China, under which, President Kim will travel to Pyongyang to
hold a summit with DPRK leader Kim Jong Il.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first-ever inter-Korean summit since the Korean
War in the early 1950s.

ZHENGZHOU, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Henan Province
has become the fifth gross domestic product (GDP) giant among the
country's provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics from the province's Bureau of Statistics
showed that the hinterland province's GDP has reached 456.5
billion yuan (about 55 billion US dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
The province's GDP has witnessed an average annual growth rate
of 11.7 percent over the past nine years with momentum of
infrastructure construction and industrial development.
</P>
<P>
It has been noticed that the growth rate of the agricultural
sector has declined by 10 percentage points while that of the
industrial sector up by nearly 10 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that it indicated that the economic framework of
the province has been shifting to an industrial one from the
agricultural one. It was considered a tremendous change for Henan
which was known as a traditional agricultural giant in the country.
</P>
<P>
The province is planning to attract coastal capital and
technologies with its potential advantages of resources, low cost,
and market.
</P>
<P>
Economists also pointed out that with a total population of
more than 93 million, Henan still needs to work even harder to
become an economically strong province.

<HEADLINE> Steel Prices Pick Up in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Prices for some steel products
have been on the rise in northern and eastern China as the
industry's efforts to curb steel production begins to take effect.
</P>
<P>
The prices of steel for construction surged an average of 50-
100 yuan per ton, compared with April 1 this year, after nine
steel giants in the northern provinces announced a rise in the
price of this particular product.
</P>
<P>
The price for steel sheet went up 300-350 yuan per ton compared
with the level in January this year. These price hikes are the
biggest in years, experts note.
</P>
<P>
"The positive change has reversed the long doldrums of the
steel market, providing opportunities for steel enterprises to
step up restructuring and gain better economic returns," they
point out.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute the price rise to a set of circumstances.
Internationally, the price rise on the global market boosted steel
exports, easing the imbalance of domestic supply and demand.
Domestically, China's efforts to curb production have taken effect
and the beginning of infrastructure projects nationwide,
especially in the western region, strongly bolstered domestic
demand for building materials.
</P>
<P>
They also point out that the price increase of some basic
materials, such as coal and coke, also triggered the surge in
steel prices.

townships and over 6,700 villages linked up by highways this year,
Vice-Minister of Communications Li Juchang announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a national conference on highway construction at
this capital city of southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region, Li said that China will push to make 99 percent of its
townships and 90 percent of villages accessible by highways.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China will set aside 180 billion yuan (more than
20 billion US dollars) for the massive project.
</P>
<P>
Last year China invested a record 218.9 billion yuan for
communications projects. The country built 2,872 km of expressways,
extending the total mileage of expressways to 11,605 km.
</P>
<P>
The country also built 73,200 km of highways in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Sex Crimes Decrease in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The number of sex crimes has
declined over the past 20 years in Beijing, according to today's
Beijing Morning Post.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted statistics from local courts to show that
crime in general is increasing, while those related to sex are
decreasing. Now, fewer than three percent of the criminal cases
are sex related, seven percent lower than in the early '80s.
</P>
<P>
Some sociologists said this phenomenon is partly due to better
public education in the areas of sex and law, a greater variety of
social activities, and an improving quality of the population as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
Some judges attribute the decrease of sex crimes to brighter
nights in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
They said sex crimes often happen in remote and dark areas, and
Beijing has taken measures to light the city, which greatly helps
to improve public security.

<HEADLINE> Cult Leader Becomes Anti-China Tool (4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Why did Li Hongzhi and his ilk decide to give up their cloak of
"not interfering in politics, no opposition to the government, and
no seeking refuge with political forces at home or abroad" and
then do all they could to serve as a pawn of anti-China forces?
</P>
<P>
The reason is very simple: they hope to sustain the declining
fate of the Falun Gong cult, the article said.
</P>
<P>
Since April 25, 1999, and especially since July 22, 1999, Li
and his like never stopped organizing the core members of the cult
to stir up trouble.
</P>
<P>
However, all of their schemes failed, and the majority of Falun
Gong practitioners who had been deceived into believing saw
through the evil essence of Li and broke away from the
organization.
</P>
<P>
Li and his followers residing abroad attempted to ask some
governments to exert pressure on China. But there was no positive
response.
</P>
<P>
To prolong their existence, they shifted their strategy and
tried to seek some political forces which hoped to use them to
sabotage China's social and political stability.
</P>
<P>
To meet the needs of the anti-China forces, Li and his like
often defamed the Chinese government as one which violated human
rights and interfered in religious freedom.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the anti-China forces in the U.S. also showed
their increased interest in Li, and some even began to voice their
support of the cult.
</P>
<P>
For example, a few U.S. congressmen made public their
displeasure with China's move against the Falun Gong cult, and a
month later, some congressmen asked the U.S. administration to
publicly censure China for its crackdown on Falun Gong.

<HEADLINE> Cult Leader Becomes Anti-China Tool (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
These people have forgotten Li Hongzhi's pledge that Falun Gong
organizations will "never be involved in politics, never oppose
the government, and never throw in their lot with any domestic or
foreign political force."
</P>
<P>
These days, the United States Commission on Human Rights has
been holding its 56th session in Geneva, Switzerland. Some
Americans who are making irresponsible remarks on the pretext of
"human rights" have made Falun Gong an important part of their
anti-China proposal.
</P>
<P>
Anti-China forces in the United States are paying much "
attention" to the Falun Gong cult and they have valued lies such
as, the Chinese government has suppressed "civilians" and "
persecuted Falun Gong practitioners on a large scale," all
fabricated by the cult leader and his followers.
</P>
<P>
However, they have not paid the least "attention" to the fact
that many Falun Gong practitioners have suffered from the cult,
with over 1,500 losing their lives and over 600 developing serious
mental illnesses.
</P>
<P>
This is not because the anti-China elements in the United
States love cults, but because the Falun Gong cult still is
somewhat capable of raising the devil in China.
</P>
<P>
In this year's anti-China proposal to the United Nations
Commission on Human Rights, Li Hongzhi and his cult have become a
new tool for anti-China elements in the United States.

<TEXT>
<P>
In October 1999, Amnesty International made public their
support of Falun Gong. A month later, the immigration authorities
in San Francisco speedily granted political asylum to a Falun Gong
practitioner.
</P>
<P>
On December 6, 1999, a high-ranking official in the U.S.
administration said publicly for the first time that the U.S. was
worried about the Chinese government's ban on Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
By then, the anti-China forces had accepted, for their own
political needs, Li Hongzhi and the Falun Gong cult.
</P>
<P>
Incidents of the past several months show that Li Hongzhi and
his ilk had political ambitions and tried to confront the Chinese
government. Now, they have given them up to the anti-China forces,
and have become the tools of anti-China activists.
</P>
<P>
Also, it seems that Li and his like are not satisfied with
their ugly performances, and will continue their attempts to
oppose the government and people.
</P>
<P>
On April 16, a leading member of the Falun Gong cult organized
some members to make trouble in Victoria Park in Hong Kong to show
their support for Li's activities in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Li and his followers approached the Dalai Lama
clique, which also showed interest in Falun Gong. These two groups
of political forces also joined hands in Geneva to work for the U.
S. anti-China motion.
</P>
<P>
It's a pity that Li has degraded from a cult leader of
omnipotence to a pawn of international anti-China forces.
</P>
<P>
It's even more lamentable that history has proved time and
again that persons who have become the enemies of the country,
people and nation will be eventually doomed.

On March 2, a Chinese-American Falun Gong follower spread
rumors at a hearing on "Human Rights Issues in China and Tibet"
held by the U.S. Congress Foreign Relations Committee. The speaker,
who claimed he was detained for eight days in Beijing a month
before for "protecting Falun Gong," won the appreciation of some
members of the committee.
</P>
<P>
On March 16, Zhang Erping, a close aide to Li Hongzhi, and Wei
Jingsheng attended a hearing on "Religious Freedom in China and
Tibet" held by the U.S. Commission on International Religious
Freedom. In his speech, Wei urged foreign countries concerned to
block China's entry into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
On March 20, when the 56th session of the United Nations
Commission on Human Rights was inaugurated, Li Hongzhi held a news
conference and publicized a "news announcement" claiming they were
very happy to see that the U.S. government was preparing to raise
a proposal criticizing China's human rights record in 1999 at the
session, and that human rights violations must not be regarded as
an internal affair.
</P>
<P>
So far, at this session of the United Nations Commission on
Human Rights, Li Hongzhi, Wei Jingsheng, and other advocates of "
Taiwan independence," "Tibet independence," and a "democratic
movement," have been lobbying for the U.S.-sponsored anti-China
proposal.

<HEADLINE> China Strengthens Supervision over Milk Powder Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- China's annual output of milk
powder for babies has been increased from 10,000 tons to 80,000
tons over the past ten years, and supervision has recently been
strengthened to ensure quality.
</P>
<P>
A report released by the State Bureau of Quality and Technical
Supervision today shows that the quality of famous-brand Chinese
milk powder is relatively good, and producers are now equipped
with advanced equipment to ensure product quality.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the qualification rate of imported milk
powder and the milk powder produced by foreign-funded enterprises
reached 93.7 percent, according to a recent random examination.
</P>
<P>
However, quality problems were found in medium- and small-sized
enterprises, whose qualification rates were only 42.9 percent and
27.3 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the major proportion of the milk powder market share
in China is held by famous-brand Chinese and imported products.
</P>
<P>
Those enterprises failing to meet national standards will be
fined by the bureau and forced to improve quality.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Business Communities Asked to Forge Network for Globalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Business communities in
ASEAN countries were Monday asked to form a strong networking
capability to face the problem of economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
Making the call, Minister in Malaysian Prime Minister's
Department Bernard Dompok said that like it or not, the private
sector will have to face liberalization with foreign multinational
companies coming into their traditional markets.
</P>
<P>
"A viable option to meet this challenge is to install a coherent
and comprehensive network of business communities, each
contributing their own strengths to form a stronger and more
cohesive force," Bernama quoted him as saying at the launching of
the Malaysia Business Council of the Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia-
Philippine East Asean Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA) in Kuching, Sarawak
State, East Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the BIMP-EAGA Malaysia Business Council's
formation was timely in view of the various onslaughts of
globalization.
</P>
<P>
The private sectors under the six-year-old BIMP-EAGA have not
fully utilized the rich resources the region was endowed with, he
said, adding they should make full use of the various forums in
BIMP-EAGA to develop business ventures.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Businessmen Asked to Tap BIMP-EAGA Potentials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Businessmen have
been urged to explore the tremendous potentials in the Brunei-
Indonesia- Malaysia-Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA).
</P>
<P>
BIMP-EAGA Malaysian Business Council (BEMBC) Advisor Abdul
Rahman Maidin said Monday that complimentary resources of member
countries could be harnessed through the regional economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia with its high skilled manufacturing technology,
services and finance sectors could, for example, compliment
Indonesia's surplus of labor, land and natural resources and labor
intensive light manufacturing, he said at a seminar in conjunction
with the launching of the BEMBC in Kuching, Sarawak, East Malaysia,
according to Bernama news agency.
</P>
<P>
He called upon businessmen to look into the possibility of
developing border towns or friendship cities as part of the
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said that Trans-Borneo land-based fiber optic system, Trans-
Borneo-Mindanao railway system and establishment of timber

as well as Malaysia's Sarawak, Sabah and Labuan and Philippines'
Mindanao and Pahlawan -- currently have a combined population of
30 million including a labor force of 11.3 million.
</P>
<P>
The BIMP-EAGA's population was expected to swell to 44 million
by 2010 when 18 million labor force would be anticipated.

<HEADLINE> 23 Rebels Killed in Northern Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan Defense Ministry
Monday said government troops killed 23 Tamil rebels on Sunday in
a fresh outbreak of fighting in the northern Jaffna Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Government troops engaged a group of rebels in general area
Kattaratan and Paddikkudiyiruppu on Sunday morning, killing eight
rebels, the ministry spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday afternoon in general area Kudarapu, government troops
confronted a group of Tamil rebels, killing at least five "Tigers".
Subsequently rebels retaliated with mortars injuring one soldier,
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He added that in another incident during the day in general
area Veddukadu and Kovilkadu, troops sniped and killed at least 10
rebels.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil rebels are engaged in an ongoing offensive aimed at
taking control of Jaffna Peninsula, their stronghold which the
government troops recaptured in May 1996.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, who have been fighting a war against the government
since 1983 for a separate Tamil state in the country, now main
target appears to be Elephant pass, the main road link between the
peninsula and the mainland.
</P>
<P>
The rebels launched their operation, called Oyantha Alaikal at
Elephant Pass last December.
</P>
<P>
Fighting has intensified since 26 March this year, and over 120
soldiers have been reportedly killed since that time. The Defense
Ministry early said the Tamil rebels had lost more than 300
fighters.

<HEADLINE> S. African President to Visit Zimbabwe Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 17 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Thabo Mbeki is expected to pay a state visit to strife-torn
Zimbabwe soon, the president's office confirmed on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Presidential aide Parks Mankahlana said he was not sure of the
date, but a state visit was pending.
</P>
<P>
The visit has been on the cards for some time and is not as a
result of the worsening situation in Zimbabwe, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mankahlana said he would not be drawn on the significance of
the visit so near to Zimbabwe's general elections and in the midst
of the ongoing political and economic turmoil in that country.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, South African government
officials have repeatedly said that Pretoria will pursue "quiet
diplomacy" to help President Robert Mugabe solve the land question
in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Former South African president Nelson Mandela echoed this on
Monday when he told reporters in Johannesburg that any problems
South Africa has with Zimbabwe should be discussed through
diplomatic channels.
</P>
<P>
"To my own experience, South Africa would be more effective if
they dealt with the problem quietly," Mandela said.

<HEADLINE> Russian Environmental Activist Acquitted of Spying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Supreme Court on
Monday declared former Navy Captain Alexander Nikitin not guilty
of spying and divulging state secrets.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court's criminal cases collegium upheld Nikitin's
acquittal by the St. Petersburg city court on December 29, 1999,
and rejected an appeal against the sentence filed by the city's
Prosecutor's Office, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Security Service, the main successor to the Soviet
KGB, had brought charges of high treason and spying against
Nikitin, who wrote a report on radiation safety in Russia's
Northern Fleet for the Norwegian ecological organization Bellona
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court ruled that Nikitin's activities had not been
punishable when he was engaged in them, nor was a list available
of secret data. The court could not therefore continue looking
into the case.
</P>
<P>
Because the prosecutor involved in the case believed that the
investigation had been thorough, the court ruled that there was no
reason why it should continue.
</P>
<P>
The acquittal of Nikitin by the St. Petersburg city court takes
effect as of Monday, but the Prosecutor General's Office may
appeal it again to the Supreme Court presidium, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Nikitin had been held in a St. Petersburg remand center for 10
months in 1996 and was not allowed to leave town.
</P>
<P>
He welcomed the ruling by the Supreme Court, describing it as
an indication that the law is in force in Russia. Nikitin also
said he would continue environment protection activities.
</P>
<P>
He said he also plans to visit his wife and daughter, who
reside in Canada, Interfax said.

<P>
WUHAN, April 17 (Xinhua) -- China's Wuhan city will earmark
three million yuan (361,446 U.S. dollars) as a special fund this
year to encourage export of high-tech products.
</P>
<P>
Local officials believe that using science and technology to
spur foreign trade will help Wuhan, capital of central China's
Hubei Province, get better prepared for challenges after China is
admitted into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
The encouragement measures of the special fund include giving
discounts and awards to high-tech exporters.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another scientific and technological innovative fund
for small enterprises in Wuhan will also give major aid to export
programs of high-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
High-tech exporters will be recommended in priority to domestic
and overseas bourses.
</P>
<P>
High-tech exporters will also enjoy income tax rebate and the
reimbursed money will be injected into their enterprises as state
capital.
</P>
<P>
The city government has worked out a list of 50 high-tech
export products, involving areas of electronic information, bio-
tech engineering and new medicine, new materials, new energies and
environment protection.
</P>
<P>
Wuhan is one of China's 15 cities to pilot the practice of
using science and technology to promote foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that export of the city's high-tech products
will make up one quarter of the city's total in three years.

<HEADLINE> China to Maintain Cotton Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The purchase price of cotton this
year on China's domestic market will remain at 400 yuan (about 49
US dollars) per 50 kilograms, basically the same as last year,
according to the State Price Information Center.
</P>
<P>
The opening of cotton market since last September brought down
cotton prices by a wide margin, and statistics show that the
average price was 380 yuan per 50 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
However, exports and domestic sales increases of cotton
products as well as a recovering world market pushed up prices to
420 yuan per 50 kilograms during the first two months this year.
</P>
<P>
Large cotton stockpiles in China and increased cotton acreage
in the world's major cotton producers including the United States
and several Central Asian countries will possibly lead to a fall
in cotton prices, the center said.

<HEADLINE> HK Unemployment Rate Edges Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 17 (Xinhua) -- A senior government economist
Monday announced that Hong Kong's unemployment rate edged down in
the latest period, along with a further pick-up in overall
economic activity.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government
Economist K Y Tang said the underemployment rate, however, showed
some increase, conceivably due to a greater number of the earlier
unemployed persons being engaged as temporary or part-time workers.
</P>
<P>
The provisional seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for the
first three months this year was 5.6 percent, and the provisional
underemployment rate was 2.8 percent, according to the latest
labor force statistics released Monday by the Census and
Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary for Education and Manpower Joseph W P Wong said
that in line with the recovery in the economy, more jobs were
available in the labor market.
</P>
<P>
"In March the number of vacancies registered with the Labor
Department set a record high level of 18,400 representing a 35
percent increase over the same month last year," Wong said. "
Increases were generally recorded across the board in most
industry and occupational groups", he added.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Local Employment Services of the Labor
Department also showed that more job-seekers had succeeded in
finding jobs. In March, the department found jobs for over 5,300
job seekers.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China Vows to Tighten Control over Medicine Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- China will take effective
measures to strengthen supervision over the quality of medicine
and stem fake products from flowing into the market, the State
Drug Administration (SDA) announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The SDA, China's drug-quality watchdog, also announced that it
has suspended seven pharmaceutical plants from producing seven
kinds of products for quality reasons.
</P>
<P>
A sample survey of 8,501 kinds of medicine revealed that 754
failed to meet state standards. Compared with 2.7 percent
substandard drug products from pharmaceutical plants, about 12
percent of the drugs available in drug stores or used in hospitals
were of poor quality.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted in the first quarter of this year by
the National Institute for Control of Pharmaceutical and
Biological Products and its local branches.

<HEADLINE> Cult Leader Becomes Anti-China Tool (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- On April 13, more than 100 "Falun
Gong" activists held an illegal gathering on Tian'anmen Square in
the center of Beijing, but they were immediately stopped by people
and police on the spot.
</P>
<P>
Shortly afterwards, the overseas media reported the event based
on exaggerated reports faxed by the so-called "Information Center
for Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China" in Hong Kong,
which claimed that more than 200 "Falun Gong" practitioners
protested and were arrested in Beijing's Tian'anmen Square, and
linked it to the issue of human rights.
</P>
<P>
Since April 25, 1999, when "Falun Gong" followers held a large-
scale gathering in Beijing, the Li Hongzhi-led cult group has
never halted their confrontation with the government and law,
consistently organizing and agitating "Falun Gong" believers to
hold illegal gatherings around the country.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday's illegal gathering was nothing new, and is but
another law-defying and anti-government activity, though it was
better organized and planned this time.
</P>
<P>
However, what was unusual this time was the speed with which
the foreign media exaggerated their reports of the event. Now,
some "Falun Gong"-sponsored overseas websites have exposed the
secret that the United Nations Commission on Human Rights is
planning to vote on a U.S.-raised proposal to condemn China.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President in Alexandria for Talks with Mubarak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALEXANDRIA (Egypt), April 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin arrived in this Mediterranean port city on Monday from Tel
Aviv, Israel, for a special meeting with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak. 
</P>
<P>
During his one-day stay here, Jiang will hold talks with Mubarak
on international and regional issues of common concern, especially
the Middle East peace process, and ways of further promoting
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president was greeted at the airport by Egyptian
Prime Minister Atef Obeid and other high-ranking officials. Chinese
Ambassador to Egypt An Huihou and Embassy and Consulate staff were
at the airport to welcome Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak held a grand welcoming ceremony at the Ras el-Tinne
Palace near the seaside of the Mediterranean for the Chinese
president before the two leaders began their special meeting.
</P>
<P>
In a written speech issued at the airport, Jiang said he has
been looking forward to meeting with Mubarak to exchange views on
issues of common concern. He expressed his belief that the meeting
will help promote the friendly bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China and Egypt are world-known ancient civilizations, and the
peoples of the two countries have enjoyed a long history of
friendship, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Alexandria was the first African city ever
introduced to the Chinese in ancient times, and that as early as in
China's Han Dynasty 120 B.C., the envoys sent by the Chinese
government already arrived in the city.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of diplomatic relations, China and Egypt
have forged sincere and sound ties on the basis of mutual respect
and mutual benefit, and have carried out fruitful cooperation in
the fields of politics, economy and culture, as well as in
international affairs, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the joint communique on the establishment of
Sino-Egyptian strategic cooperative relations signed during
Mubarak's visit to China last year set up the framework for
development of bilateral ties in the future.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is an important country in the Arab world and African
region, and plays a special role in regional and world affairs,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang paid a state visit to Egypt in 1996, while Mubarak has
visited China seven times. During Mubarak's last visit to China,
the two countries agreed to forge a strategic partnership.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's entourage arriving on the same special plane include
Vice Premier Qian Qichen, State Councillor Wu Yi, Director of the
General Office of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) Central
Committee Wang Gang, Minister in Charge of the State Development
Planning Commission Zeng Peiyan, Director of the Policy Research
Office of CPC Central Committee Teng Wensheng, Vice Foreign
Minister Ji Peiding, Vice Director of the General Office of the CPC
Central Committee and Director of the Central Guards Bureau You
Xigui, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Sun
Guangxiang, Special Assistant Wang Huning and Director of President
Jiang's office Jia Ting'an.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made this special trip to Alexandria to meet Mubarak
following visits to Israel and Palestine within a five-nation tour.
He will travel on to visit Turkey, Greece and South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Personal Computer Sales on Increase in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 17 (Xinhua) -- A total of 835,000 units of
personal computers (PCs) were estimated to be sold this year
against a total of 680,000 units sold in Malaysia last year.
</P>
<P>
However, computer usage in Malaysia is still in the initial
stage and this means that the opportunities for PC sales are great,
Bernama news agency said Monday.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that about 4.0 percent of households in
Malaysia own at least one PC and there are only 45 PCs for every 1,
000 Malaysians.
</P>
<P>
It is also estimated that the saturation stage would be reached
in 2004/05 as it normally takes about five years for a country to
have 10 percent of the households owning a PC each.
</P>
<P>
There are about 700,000 register Internet users in Malaysia in
1999 and by the year 2003, one conservative estimate puts the
projected figure to be at 1.3 million users.
</P>
<P>
Under the Seventh Malaysia Plan (1996-2000), the Malaysian
government allocated 2.3 billion ringgit (605.263 million U.S.
dollars) for the government computerization program compared with
1.4 billion ringgit (368.421 million U.S. dollars) spent under the
Sixth Malaysia Plan.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainians Overwhelmingly Approve Constitutional Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainians overwhelmingly approved
changes to their constitution which could increase the power of
President Leonid Kuchma over parliament, the electoral commission
announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
A Sunday referendum proposed four amendments to Ukraine's
constitution including allowing the president to dissolve
parliament and reducing the number of parliamentary deputies from
450 to 300.
</P>
<P>
Other provisions would divide the legislature into an upper and
lower house and strip deputies of immunity in certain cases.
</P>
<P>
With 94 percent of votes counted, each of the four proposals
received between 81 percent and 90 percent support, Ukraine's
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Kuchma expressed that "the mission of the president,
as the guarantor of the constitution, is to ensure the will of the
people, if the parliament is not able to do so."
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Kuchma, elected in 1994 and reelected
last November, has reportedly had strained relations with
parliament which he accuses of blocking his reform projects.

<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Hainan, the southernmost province
in China, plans to make the local oil and gas processing sector
its pillar industry, said a source from China National
Petrochemical Corp. (Sinopec) here today.
</P>
<P>
The island province, which administers the largest areas of the
South China Sea, has potential gas reserves of 5.8 trillion cubic
meters and potential oil reserves of 29.1 billion tons in the main
basins of the sea including the Yingge Sea and Beibu Bay.
</P>
<P>
Gas reserves totaling 100 billion cubic meters have been
verified in the Ya 13-1 gas field in the basin of Yingge Sea which
is expected to maintain stable gas production for at least 20
years.
</P>
<P>
Other newly discovered gas-bearing structures such as the
Dongfang 1-1, Ledong 22-1, Ledong 15-1 are also rich in gas
resources.
</P>
<P>
Sinopec scientists note that the exploration and processing of
gas and oil could help boost other related sectors including
petrochemicals and energy and fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
Thus far, a group of gas-or oil-based industrial projects -- a
power plant in Sanya, and a fertilizer factory producing 300,000
tons of synthetic ammonia and 520,000 tons of urea, have been
established and put into operation.

<HEADLINE> China's Western Development: A Huge Business Opportunity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- China's western development
strategy is a huge business opportunity, said Chen Jinhua,
chairman of the China Enterprise Confederation, here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the on-going China Business Summit 2000, Chen said
business contacts involving 100 billion yuan (about 12.9 billion
US dollars) had been signed during a recent east-west trade fair,
which shows the irresistible attraction of China's western region.
</P>
<P>
The State Development Planning Commission will announce a
detailed plan for China's western development before the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
China is concentrating on infrastructure construction,
ecological environment improvement, economic restructuring,
science and education development, and further opening up.
</P>
<P>
This year's ten large construction projects in the western
region, which involve railways, highways, urban elevated railways,
airports, water conservancy, and natural gas pipelines, will
provide great opportunities for investors worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Chen pointed out that China's strategy will help expand
domestic demand and guarantee steady growth of the economy. The
strategy will also be very helpful for promoting social stability
and the harmonious development of all provinces.
</P>
<P>
He said that low labor and land costs in western China are very
attractive, and foreign investors are welcome.
</P>
<P>
China's western region cover 56 percent of the country's land
area and has 23 percent of China's population. But its per-capita
gross domestic product is only 60 percent of the national average.

<P>
JAKARTA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid returns home on Monday from his ten-day overseas trip.
</P>
<P>
The president along with his entourage including local
journalists arrived here at about 12;20 a.m. (local time) from
China's Hong Kong, the last stopover of the president's tour which
also brought him to South Africa, Mexico, Cuba and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Wahid was welcomed by Vice-president Megawati Soekarnoputeri at
Halim Perdana Kusuma airport, along with some cabinet members.
</P>
<P>
During his overseas trip Wahid attended the G-77 summit in Cuba
where he gave his support for more constructive cooperation among
the G-77 members.
</P>
<P>
The President was also believed to have played a significant
role particularly in influencing donor countries to meet the

During the Paris Club II meeting (April 12-13), the government
of Indonesia was successful in asking for its foreign debt
rescheduling mounting to 5.8 billion U.S. dollars from the donors,
greater than the 2.1 billion U.S. dollars it had expected.

<HEADLINE> China to Run 3,000 Tourism Trains This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Railways will
operate 3,000 to 4,000 tourism trains this year in response to the
government's strategy for boosting tourism to develop the national
economy.
</P>
<P>
This decision was made a national working conference on China's
special trains for tourism held recently in Kunming, capital of
southwest China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also decided to accelerate the speed and improve
the service of the country's special tourism trains.
</P>
<P>
China began to put into service these special trains in 1997,
and they have proved very popular among domestic and overseas
passengers.
</P>
<P>
In 1999 alone, the Ministry of Railways opened 11 train routes
to this tourist destination from the country's eight major
terminals, running a total of 932 tourism trains and transporting
5.32 million passengers.
</P>
<P>
Despite the obvious social and economic benefits from the
special trains, ministry officials attending the conference said
China's development of such trains is still in its primary stage,
and they cited their slow speeds and multiple stops.
</P>
<P>
The just-ended conference was an attempt to solve these
problems and improve the service on special tourism trains, they
added.
</P>
<P>
The conference also decided to authorize all local railway
bureaus to give 10 to 25 percent discounts for tourism train
tickets, they noted.
</P>
<P>
Sources with the conference disclosed that the Railways
Ministry also plans to open 26 special tourism train routes across
the country, covering major national scenic spots such as Emei
Mountain in southwest China's Sichuan Province, the Turpan Basin
in western China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Zhangjiajie
in central China's Hunan Province, and Mount Huangshan in east
China's Anhui Province.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Silk Enterprises to Upgrade Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- China is urging state-owned silk
enterprises to upgrade their reeling machines and undertake
innovation in techniques, designs and colors.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-nine programs will be carried out in the enterprises for
technical innovations with 1.54 billion yuan in subsidized loans,
according to a report of Beijing Review.
</P>
<P>
China will reduce silk industry's production by one-third this
year in an effort to improve the sector's economic returns.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four state-owned silk enterprises will go bankrupt, and
banks will be saddled with writing off 1.36 billion yuan in bad
debts.
</P>
<P>
State-owned silk reeling factories will get help to ease their
social burdens and to lower their debt-to-equity ratios, according
to the State Textile Industry Administration.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen silk enterprises will be allowed to launch debt-to-
equity swaps in 2000, and this involves 2.02 billion yuan in
capital.
</P>
<P>
The silk sector made 320 million yuan of profits during the
first 11 months of 1999 after years of government efforts to
reform the industry.
</P>
<P>
But about 65 percent of the state-owned silk enterprises are
losing money.
</P>
<P>
China's silk exports totaled 2.8 billion U.S. dollars last year,
as against 3.5 billion dollars in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Sugar Prices Continue to Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- China's sugar prices continued to
rise in April, bringing an optimistic view of profitability by
year's end among insiders.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures show that the sugar prices in Nanning, capital
of south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, a major sugar
distribution center, reached 3,150 yuan (about 380 U.S. dollars)
per ton.
</P>
<P>
Along with restructuring the sugar industry, reduced production
of sugar cane incurred by a frost last year has played an
important role in the price hike.
</P>
<P>
Analysts from the China Sugar Association warned of a drop in
sugar prices next year, and urged sugar producers not to be too
optimistic about the market outlook.
</P>
<P>
Some areas that are unsuitable for sugar production should be
forced to leave the market, while the remaining ones ought to be
required to speed up technical upgrading and enhance efficiency,
they suggested.
</P>
<P>
The retail price of sugar will not be affected much due to the
current large stockpiles and the gap between wholesale prices and
retail prices, according to market sources.

<HEADLINE> Remote Sensing Tech Used to Monitor Urban Land Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- China is employing satellite
remote sensing technology to monitor land use in its urban areas
in order to strengthen the administration of land resource.
</P>
<P>
A total of 66 large cities with populations over 500,000
including Beijing and Shanghai are now being monitored by the
Ministry of Land and Resources.
</P>
<P>
Satellite images show that eight cities made false land use
reports last year, and 19 unapproved land use projects, illegally
occupying 2,800 mu (about 186.7 hectares) of land, were detected
and shut down in time, thanks to the remote sensing technology.
</P>
<P>
The technology will effectively check the occupying of
cultivated land, said Li Yuan, vice minister of land and resources.
</P>
<P>
According to latest statistics from the ministry, China's total
cultivated land area decreased 6.549 million mu (about 436,600
hectares) in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The revised Land Use Law which became effective in 1999 is
considered the strictest in the world. This law requires that all
provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities must see to it
that the amount of arable land under their jurisdiction will not
decrease, while land quality must be improved.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan plans to set up
software technology parks in its three main cities in a bid to
speed up the development of information technology in the country.
</P>
<P>
Under a new Information Technology (IT) policy being framed by
the government, initially three Information Technology Parks will
be established in the capital of Islamabad and the two biggest
cities, Karachi and Lahore, state-run Associated Press of Pakistan
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Director General of Pakistan Computer Bureau Ejaz Hussain
Khawaja was quoted as saying that all facilities relating to
computer and information technology will be provided in the parks.
</P>
<P>
Even space will be allocated on payment in the said parks for
use by private parties which will promote IT industry in Pakistan,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Ejaz said Pakistan has great potential to export software to
earn foreign exchange for the country, but initially a sectoral
allocation of an estimated five billion rupees (96 million U.S.
dollars) needs to be invested.
</P>
<P>
IT industry is among the four key sectors the current Pakistani
government has put special emphasis on in its economic reform plan.
The government hopes to stimulate the economic growth by imitating
its neighbor India, which has become the second largest software
exporter in the world.

On Monday, the Indonesian Shang Bao daily was formally printed,
bringing the number of Mandarin newspapers in the country to nine.
</P>
<P>
The daily focuses its report on economics and business issues.
</P>
<P>
General Chairman of the Indonesia Shang Bao, Sukamdani Sahid
Gitosardjono said in a press conference that the daily also
targets its readers abroad.
</P>
<P>
"We also targeted the readers of the Indonesia Shang Bao abroad.
Particularly Chinese ethnic business people," he said.
</P>
<P>
After reform process took place following the step down of
former president Soeharto in May 1998, the number of Chinese
Mandarin newspapers have kept increasing. At present, the people
in three cities, such as Jakarta, capital of Indonesia, Medan and
Surabaya could all read Mandarin newspapers.
</P>
<P>
In the past 32 years when Soeharto was in power, Chinese
Mandarin language was barred to be learned by Indonesian and
Chinese ethnic people as well.
</P>
<P>
"But now the situation is different. The Chinese Mandarin
language is free to be learned by every body," Gitosardjono added.

<P>
Kampala, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has brought together rival cliques within Prof. Ernest Wamba dia
Wamba's RCD- Kisangani rebel group of the Democratic Republic of
the Congo for talks to bridge their differences.
</P>
<P>
The New Vision daily reported on Monday that the five-hour
talks, which was held at the State House and ended at about 1.00
a.m. local time on Sunday, had Wamba dia Wamba facing his
deputies, Mbusa Nyamwisi, the prime minister and John Tibasima
Atenyi.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted sources as saying that the talks will
resume on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Recent press reports and security sources said that the two
Wamba deputies were operating almost independent of the
scholar-turned rebel chief.
</P>
<P>
The sharp differences between the rebel leaders had a lot to do
with poor accountability for funds from minerals and customs
collections, sources said.
</P>
<P>
There was really nothing serious dividing these people, said
Col. Kahinda Otafiire, the presidential adviser on the DRC, who
also attended the meeting. He added that there was a communication
breakdown between them which enemy propaganda later used to try to
split them.
</P>
<P>
The talks have been going on well, and the issues that brought
 misunderstandings are being addressed, said Tibasima.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar Opposition Against Polling Date </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar's main opposition
party, the Civic United Front (CUF), has opposed the scheduled
date for this year' s general elections on the ground that
President Salmin Amour will have overstayed his term in office by
then, newspapers here reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Zanzibar Electoral Commission has set October 29 as the
polling day in the island state in tandem with parliamentary and
presidential elections on mainland Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
However, Leader of the Opposition in the House of
Representatives in the Isles Abubakar Khamis Bakary told the press
on Sunday that President Salmin was sworn in on October 26, 1995,
therefore his term should cease on or before the same date of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Holding elections on October 29 is a violation of the
constitution, Bakary stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to the Zanzibar Constitution, general elections must
be held within 30 days before the expire of tenure of the
president.
</P>
<P>
The CUF may seek the intervention of the court of law if the
Zanzibar Government does not change the election date, Bakary
said.
</P>
<P>
Though it joined with Tanganyika to form the United Republic of
Tanzania in 1964, Zanzibar is a semiautonomous state with its own
government an parliament.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's COMESA Pull-out to be Discussed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- A comprehensive report on
Tanzania's decision to quit the Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) is to be tabled at the forthcoming heads
of state summit in Mauritius next month.
</P>
<P>
The report, which was compiled by the council of ministers
after a recent mission to Tanzania, would be among the major items
to be discussed at the summit, said COMESA secretary general
Erastus Mwencha in an interview at the weekend in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by Monday's Times of Zambia newspaper as saying
that the secretariat is concerned at the decision by Tanzania to
leave the regional bloc.
</P>
<P>
A lot of behind-the-scene diplomatic negotiations are currently
going on to ensure that the country remains a member of COMESA
before the implementation of the Free Trade Area (FTA) later this
year, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Tanzania is an important trading partner in the region
because it provides port services to some land locked countries
including Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Apart from that, Tanzania is also a major transpoint for the
COMESA yellow card scheme, Mwencha said.
</P>
<P>
"Tanzania has a trade surplus with all COMESA trading partners
except Kenya," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Tanzania gave notice in September last
year on its decision to quit COMESA on account of a membership
duplication between the regional bloc and the Southern African
Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
Tanzania feared that the FTA would reduce its productive
capacity to compete favorably at regional level, the report said.

<HEADLINE> White Commercial Farmer Shot Dead in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 17 (Xinhua) -- A white commercial farmer in
Zimbabwe was shot dead on Saturday, allegedly by war veterans who
abducted him following a clash between his workers and
ex-combatants occupying his farm, the daily Herald reported on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted police spokesman Chief Superintendent Wayne
Bvudzijena as saying on Sunday that the victim, David Stevens
(50), of Arizona Farm, was shot between the eyes and shoulder
blades.
</P>
<P>
His body was discovered at Dapandare River Bridge, southeast of
Murehwa, Sunday morning by a police search team using
helicopters, Bvudzijena said.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, events leading to Stevens' death
started when he armed himself with a gun and instructed his
workers to arm themselves as well.
</P>
<P>
They allegedly attacked and injured 14 of the 35 war veterans,
who have been occupying the farm since February, using spears,
hoes, sticks and stones.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Britain Sunday summoned Zimbabwe's High
 Commissioner in London Simbarashe Mumbengegwi, demanding an end
to farm invasions in the African country.
</P>
<P>
The killers must be found and charged, said British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook while speaking in India.

<HEADLINE> Law on Land Unchanged in Zambia: Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Law on land ownership in Zambia
will remain the same and white farmers including new settlers
should not fear that the Zambian government will repossess their
land, said Agriculture Minister Suresh Desai here at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
When asked by some farmers whether the grabbing of land in
Zimbabwe would spill over into Zambia, the minister said the
Zambian government would not grab land from its rightful owners as
it would continue to respect land ownership laws.
</P>
<P>
The government has respected land ownership through title deeds
and would continue to allow private investors to develop the
agriculture sector, he was quoted by Monday's Times of Zambia
newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
The government has empowered both commercial and local farmers
with land for agricultural development, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Desai, the land disputes in neighboring Zimbabwe
are tied to the political history in the country, while Zambia has
no problems on commercial land ownership.
</P>
<P>
"Zambia has plenty of land that needs to be developed to
enhance economic development," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister, however, warned that the government would
repossess undeveloped land from any category of ownership.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Nosedive in Tokyo on Wall Street Plunge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices nosedived across the
board in Tokyo Monday following last Friday's plunge on Wall
Street, with the key Nikkei index posting its fifth-largest one-
day point loss.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 1,426.04 points, or 6.98
percent, from last Friday's close to end at 19,008.64.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, fell 101.24 points, or 6.12 percent, to 1,
552.46, also posting its fifth-largest one-day point fall.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section increased to 875.11 million
shares from last Friday's 683.45 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Nippon Steel was the day's volume leader.
</P>
<P>
Top monetary officials from the Group of Seven (G-7) economies
showed reticence about last Friday's Wall Street plunge in their
statement released after they met Saturday in Washington, making
investors uncomfortable, traders said.
</P>
<P>
After opening at the day's high of 20,341.50, the Nikkei lost
more than 1,800 points at one stage in the morning to fall as low
as 18,603.87.
</P>
<P>
The key market gauge, however, rebounded moderately in the
afternoon, helped partly by a remark by Shizuka Kamei, chairman of
the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) Policy Research
Council, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Kamei was quoted as saying the LDP will discuss measures to
cope with the stock market plunge, including an injection of more
than 1 trillion yen (9.6 billion U.S. dollars) in public funds
into the market.
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo on Monday, share prices were lower in all business
sectors except the electric power and gas industry.
</P>
<P>
Exporters were dampened by the savage decline on Wall Street
and the yen's strength, while high-priced telecommunication issues
also fell sharply.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, losers far
outnumbered gainers 1,236 to 113, with 35 issues closing unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Russian Shares Tumble 7-10 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian shares plunged by 7-10
percent on opening Monday in reaction to the tech stock slides on
world markets, but officials said the crash on Wall Street "will
not have serious consequences for the Russian market."
</P>
<P>
Volumes totaled 2.34 million U.S. dollars on the Russian
Trading System (RTS) by 11:15 a.m. (0700 GMT), the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The RTS-Interfax composite ruble index tumbled 6.26 percent to
205.25. The index in dollars was down 6.16 percent to 42.92,
Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
But the drop in Russian share prices was not accompanied by a
sell-off, a development seen by traders as more of a correction
following the global downturn.
</P>
<P>
First Deputy Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov, once Russia's
Finance Minister, told reporters there would be a modest drop in
Russian share prices, but that the slump will be "not so great and
sharp" as seen after Russia's financial crisis in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
U.S. shares plunged Friday on fears that an unexpected surge in
inflation could push the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.
The technology-laden Nasdaq index plummeted a record 9.67 percent
to 3,321.29 points and the Dow Jones index fell a record 617.78
points (5.66 percent) to 10,305.77.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Russian ruble also went down
Monday, from 28.4950 to 28.6035 to the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
In total, 1,982 transactions worth 167.271 million dollars were
concluded on the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange (MICEX),
Interfax reported.

<P>
SHENZHEN, April 17 (Xinhua) -- China will hold its first non-
state economy fortune forum in Shenzhen City of Guangdong Province
from June 23-25.
</P>
<P>
Entitled "2000 International Forum on Small and Medium-Sized
Chinese Enterprises and Non-State Economic Development Strategy",
the event will be jointly sponsored by six Chinese organizations,
including the State Economic and Trade Commission, Shenzhen City
Government, All China Federation of Industry and Commerce and
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, along in cooperation with a
number of overseas organizations, including UN Development Program
(UNDP).
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Chinese private businessmen, government officials
and specialists to the forum will discuss issues about Chinese non-

strategy, challenges after China's entrance into the World Trade
Organization, development ways for high-tech enterprises, and new
financing channels.
</P>
<P>
The forum will also invite high-ranking officials with well-
known international investment and fund organizations from America,
Asia and Europe to discuss with Chinese participants about how
Chinese non-state enterprises to expand business in foreign
countries and get listed at foreign stock exchanges.

<HEADLINE> Huge Potential in China's Aviation Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive Officer of China
Southern Airlines Yan Zhiqing today forecast a rosy future for the
nation's aviation industry, with an anticipated annual growth of
more than 10 percent in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
Unbalanced supply and demand in China's aviation market at
present does not mean the market is saturated, Yan said at the
ongoing China Business Summit, stressing that the market is far
from fully tapped.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, people in the United States took five flights on
average, while only one out of 20.5 Chinese took even one flight,
leaving much room for business, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Yan also gave many reasons for the booming of aviation industry.
The sustained growth of China's national economy, the coming
direct air traffic across the Taiwan Straits, and the development
of western China will all give a boost to the aviation industry.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more and more Chinese are turning to air travel
thanks to their constantly improving living standards. China is
also expecting more international air traffic as it seeks entry to
the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Yan noted that China will remain a huge market for aircraft as
its air transport keeps expanding.

<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- China and the United States
signed a contract here today for the Sino-U.S. phase II project on
air-quality monitoring.
</P>
<P>
According to the contract, the U.S. will offer 13.44 million U.
S. dollars in preferential loans to China so the country can buy
air quality monitoring equipment from the American company Dasibi
Environmental Corporation, for 33 major Chinese cities to use in
making air quality daily reports and forecasting.
</P>
<P>
During Chinese President Jiang Zemin's 1997 visit to the U.S.
the two countries signed an agreement calling for strengthening
cooperation in environmental protection and energy. U.S. President
Bill Clinton reciprocated President Jiang's visit in 1998, during
which the two countries signed a contract on the Sino-U.S. phase I
project for air-quality monitoring.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Guangyao, deputy director of China's State Environmental
Protection Administration, said at the signing ceremony that the
promotion of cooperation between the two nations in the area of
environmental protection is in the interests of both countries,
and will also be of significance for the improvement of the global
environment.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes the two sides will further expand economic and
technological cooperation in this area, thus making a contribution
to the comprehensive development of Sino-U.S. friendship and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Eugene Martin, minister-counselor of the U.S. embassy in
Beijing, said at the occasion that the signing of the contract
marks a step forward in bilateral cooperation in environmental
protection, and a success for a U.S. company to enter China's huge
market. He also praised China's environmental protection efforts.

<HEADLINE> More Young Chinese Susceptible to Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese people have been advised
to undergo cancer check-ups before the age of 30 as more and more
young people are becoming susceptible to the killer disease.
</P>
<P>
The high-risk age group for malignant tumors such as the
stomach cancer and esophagus is between 35 and 40, about 10 years
younger than previously, according to specialists with the Chinese
Academy of Medical Science.
</P>
<P>
Cancer claimed the lives of 1.26 million people in major cities
including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenyang last year,
one fourth of whom were between 40 and 50 years old, according to
today's Workers' Daily.
</P>
<P>
The doctors blame the lack of early diagnosis as major cause of
the high death rate in China, and point out that prevention,
health education, and early diagnosis have played a leading role
in the decline of cancer rates in the United States for the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
To explain why Chinese shun cancer diagnosis, the experts said
that young people are usually blindly confident that they will not
get the disease, while older people are unnecessarily afraid of
being diagnosed with cancer.
</P>
<P>
In fact, increasing pressure from social changes, environmental
pollution, and unhealthy eating habits and life styles are all
risk factors for cancer, they warned.

<HEADLINE> Ministry Calls for Stopping Cutting Cultivated Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- As China's total cultivated land
area decreased by 6.549 million mu (436,600 hectares) in 1999,
effective measures should be taken to stop this situation, the
Ministry of Land and Resources said.
</P>
<P>
Seven provinces and cities with declining cultivated areas
received a "yellow warning card" from the ministry recently, and
were forced to make efforts to compensate for the loss of arable
land and ensure that their total cultivated land area does not
continue to shrink this year.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Arable Land Protection Department under
the ministry said that a total of 12.625 million mu of arable land
in China was occupied for other use last year, and at the same
time, 6.076 million mu of cultivated land was added.
</P>
<P>
China's Land Use Law, considered the strictest in the world,
requires that all provinces, autonomous regions, and
municipalities must see to it that the amount of arable land under
their jurisdiction does not decrease, and that land quality is
improved.

<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Rapid progress in medical
technology has triggered many ethical problems which should not be
neglected, according to a Chinese health official.
</P>
<P>
Although high technology has led to more advanced treatment,
many problems also appear to be unavoidable, such as rocketing
medical expenses, regional imbalance in health-care resources, and
euthanasia, said Zhu Zonghan, director of the Beijing Municipal
Bureau of Health.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, many patients must forego effective but unaffordable
drugs, while new technology and highly skilled personnel are often
concentrated in the major hospitals of big cities, leaving the
majority of basic health care facilities in urban communities and
rural areas without these medical advances.
</P>
<P>
"Under such circumstances, principles of humanitarianism and
fairness are often challenged," Zhu was quoted in today's
Guangming Daily.
</P>
<P>
As modern technology can help maintain the life of a severely
ill patient, often at heavy cost, the necessity for euthanasia, as
well as the value of life, should be considered seriously, he said.
</P>
<P>
Another problem associated with medical progress is that
doctors may increasingly rely on technology while paying less
attention to the psychological condition of their patients, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"If we do not attach importance to the negative impact of
medical development and related social problems, overall social
progress could be affected," he added.

<HEADLINE> Website on White-Flag Dolphin Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- China has just opened a website
providing information concerning research and protection of the
white-flag dolphin in China, one of the 12 most endangered animal
species in the world.
</P>
<P>
The website, which can be reached at www.ibaiji.org, was
launched last week by the Wuhan Institute of Hydrobiology under
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) in Wuhan, capital of central
China's Hubei Province as part of the efforts to save the animal
by improving the public awareness of the situation facing the
animal.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xianfeng, a white-flag dolphin expert with the institute,
said the large mammal, which can only be found in the middle and
lower reaches of the Yangtze River, is a much more endangered
animal than the giant panda.
</P>
<P>
The dwindling number of the dolphin, which has existed for 20
to 30 million years, totals only about 100, or one-third than the
1986 figure, and one tenth of that the giant panda.
</P>
<P>
Both the dolphin and the giant panda are described by
scientists as living fossil and receive top-level state protection.

<HEADLINE> Who Earns More Money in China: Survey (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Career, education, and age are
the most important factors deciding the income of Chinese people,
according to a recent survey by the National Bureau of Statistic.
</P>
<P>
The survey reveals that people involved in high-tech industries,
real estate, finance, and insurance had the highest incomes in
1999, while people from the service sector and the machinery and
mining industries earned the least amount of money.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that this income distribution profile will
continue for the next few years.
</P>
<P>
People in the highest income bracket earn more than 200,000
yuan (about 24,000 US dollars) a year, but they account for less
than one percent of the Chinese population, which now stands at 1.
25 billion.
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows that the higher the education level, the
higher the income.
</P>
<P>
Some people around the age of 30 are now making a fortune, a
prospect undreamed of by the older generation now in their 60s and
70s.
</P>
<P>
The survey indicates that the average per-capita income of
families with breadwinners below the age of 30 is much higher than
those of families with primary earners of 41 to 45.
</P>
<P>
This is because young people are usually better educated and
have fewer family burdens, and they are also more willing to get
involved in the new industries.

<HEADLINE> Annette Lu's Separatist Remarks Refuted in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Over the past several days
newspapers and scholars in Macao have strongly refuted the remarks
of Annette Lu advocating "independence of Taiwan".
</P>
<P>
The Macao Daily News said in an editorial on Saturday that "
there would be no peaceful days in the country without the
eradication of those advocating Taiwan independence."
</P>
<P>
Annette Lu's absurd statements of "distant relatives and close
neighbors" obliterated the history that Taiwan has been an
inalienable part of China's territory, and distorted the flesh-and-
blood ties of the people across the Taiwan Straits, the editorial
said.
</P>
<P>
Other local newspapers also noted that Annette Lu has
stubbornly advocated "independence of Taiwan", and seems to walk
farther along the notorious path, challenging all the Chinese
people who are resolved to complete the reunification of the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
Vong Fong Va, director of the Macao Chinese Education
Association, said in an interview with Xinhua on Saturday that
Annette Lu is merely driven by her political ambition and that her
statements are more cheeky than the separatist remarks of Lee Teng-
hui.
</P>
<P>
"She is making a bet on the security of the 23 million people
in Taiwan," Vong Fong Va said, warning that Taiwan people should
be highly alert to her actions.
</P>
<P>
Ieong Wan Chong, a professor with the University of Macao, also
in an interview with Xinhua, said that reunification of the two
sides of the Taiwan Straits is a major trend and the common
aspiration of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
"The clamors of Annette Lu are only the last struggles of those
advocating Taiwan independence and her actions are doomed to fail,
" the scholar said.

<HEADLINE> Who Earns More Money in China: Survey (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Only 2.2 percent of the people surveyed have part-time jobs,
and they are mostly composed of laid-off workers, retired people,
and some professional personnel such as accountants and
translators.
</P>
<P>
Narrowing the income gap between people may become an important
issue for central and local governments, as well as all of society,
according to a report in today's Beijing Youth Daily.
</P>
<P>
The survey also reveals a strange twist in the income of
different age groups. In 1999, people between 41 to 45 had the
lowest incomes in the country, while some people between 55 and 60,
who were among the higher income class 10 years age, are still
earning big money.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the education level of people between the age
of 41 to 45 is usually lower than the average because of the
Cultural Revolution in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and they
also have been the most affected by state-owned enterprise lay-
offs.

ANKARA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Turkish newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News:
</P>
<P>
-- Turkey on Sunday asked the British government, for the second
time in two days, to tighten security to protect Turkish nationals
and their property in the country on the eve of the soccer match
between Turkey's Galatasaray team and Britain's Leeds United on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Turks who live in Britain continued to be attacked in revenge
after two British soccer fans were stabbed to death by Turkish
hooligans during Galatasaray-Leeds United match in Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- The leaders of Turkey's ruling coalition were expected to
hold a summit again on Monday to determine a candidate for the
presidential post.
</P>
<P>
The summit, held in last Thursday, did not reach any consensus
on a candidate. The poll showed that people expect a new president
to be corruption-free, honest and democratic.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom):
</P>
<P>
-- A trade delegation consisting of Turkish businessmen will
visit Iran between May 27-31 to explore ways of expanding bilateral
trade in the fields of iron, chemical, plastic, automotive,
packaging, food, glass, textile and electronic goods.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The police Sunday recommended indicting Israeli
Transportation Minister Yitzhak Mordechai on three counts of
committing indecent acts by force against three women over an
eight-year period. The crimes carry a total maximum sentence of
seven years in jail.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the police recommended indicting Michal Kallah,
head of the Transportation Ministry bureau in Tel Aviv, and
Mordechai's driver Meir Ohayun for obstruction of justice. The
police handed over their recommendations to the State Attorney's
Office for review.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai issued a statement claiming he is innocent of all the
charges and "would fight with all my might to prove my innocence
and to preserve my good name."
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is considering handing over
more than 1 percent of the West Bank as part of a third
redeployment that would be linked to the framework agreement he
wants to reach with the Palestinians by mid-May.
</P>
<P>
While the Palestinians are expecting a major handover of
territory in the third redeployment, possibly as much as all of the
territory of the West Bank except specific parcels of land where
there are settlements and military installations, Israel believes
it is only bound to hand over 1 percent by agreements with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's cabinet session, Barak said he was considering
integrating part of the third withdrawal into the framework
agreement. He did not mention any specific numbers.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- The release of the 13 Lebanese administrative detainees,
ordered by the Israeli Supreme Court last week, will not be carried
out Monday as scheduled, following a last-minute appeal by the
family of missing Israeli navigator Ron Arad, who was captured in
Lebanon in 1986.
</P>
<P>
The detainees have been imprisoned for years without trial as
bargaining chips to be used in exchange for information on Israel
Defense Forces soldiers taken prisoners or missing in action in
Lebanon. Several of them were imprisoned without trial for 13
years.
</P>
<P>
The Prison Authority had nearly completed its preparations for
freeing the detainees, who were originally expected to be released
Monday to the Red Cross in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- To no one's surprise, the 25-percent plunge in New York's
Nasdaq index in the past week began to take its toll on Tel Aviv
Sunday. And like Nasdaq, high-tech stocks were especially hard-hit
with the Tel-tech index losing 17 percent of its value.
</P>
<P>
The bull-chip Maof index fell 7.4 percent to 464.8 points and
the Tel Aviv 100 slipped 8.1 percent to 460.5 points. Market
traders could not recall such steep losses in a single day since
1994.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed some of the decline to the coming halt in
trade for the Jewish Passover holiday. It is still unclear whether
the trend would lead to further sell-offs at the start of trading
Monday.

<HEADLINE> Namibia Relaxes Exchange Controls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Namibia has
relaxed its exchange controls, the South African Business Day
newspaper reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the new policy, Namibian companies are allowed to
invest up to 38.5 million U.S. dollars in member countries of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) and up to 7.7
million dollars elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
To encourage investments, companies will now be allowed to use
 part of their local cash holdings to finance up to 10 percent of
approved new foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
Companies may also make use of asset-share swaps to finance
their investments abroad. They will now be allowed to utilize part
of their local cash holdings to repay up to 10 percent of their
outstanding foreign debt raised to finance foreign investments,
provided the foreign debt has been in existence for a minimum
period of two years.
</P>
<P>
For institutional investors, the current asset swap
dispensation will remain, but the 15 percent limit of "total
assets employed in Namibia" will change to "15 percent of total
assets".
</P>
<P>
For unit trusts, the definition will be the same for
institutional investors, but the limit will be increased to 20
percent of "total assets under management".
</P>
<P>
Further, long-term insurers, pension funds and unit trusts,
through unit trust management companies, may now apply to avail of
foreign currency transfers in this year of up to 10 percent of the
net inflow of funds during the 1999 calendar year, to acquire
foreign portfolio investments.

NAIROBI, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaria has claimed 99 lives in
the past three months in southwest Kenya, the Daily Nation

The paper quoted Julius Ogato, medical superintendent of the

last for two weeks with another consignment expected to arrive
from the capital Nairobi soon.
</P>
<P>
Local leaders in Kisii, a malaria-prone area along the Lake
Victoria, have been urged to sensitize the people to preventive
measures against the disease to avoid epidemics.

If given the green light, these fish would be the first

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's External Reserves Remains Robust </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's external reserves
remained robust, Finance Minister Tun Daim Zainuddin said Monday.
</P>
<P>
As at March 31 this year, the country's reserves stood at 33.9
billion U.S.dollars, sufficient to finance 6.3 months of retained
imports, he said at Kuala Lumpur City Securities Sdn Bhd "
Conference for Fund Managers," in Putra Jaya near here.
</P>
<P>
"This exceeded the minimum target of five months set under the
National Economic Recovery Plan. At this level, our external
reserves are 5.7 times higher than our short term external debt,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's debt servicing ratio remained low at 5.3 percent,
the minister said, adding his country's credit standing continued
to remain strong while the risk of default never arose, even at
the height of the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Tun Daim Zainuddin also said the 5.8 percent gross domestic
product (GDP) growth projected for this year would emanate mainly
from the pick up in domestic demand in general, the stronger
private consumption in particular.
</P>
<P>
Private capital expenditure is expected to strengthen and
register positive growth as excess production capacity diminishes
with higher output while public sector fixed capital formation is
expected to continue to increase at a double digit rate, he said.
</P>
<P>
With the pick up in demand in the country this year, there
would be some build-up in inflationary pressures but the rate is
not expected to exceed three percent, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
He said that his country's economic outlook is very positive,
barring any unforeseen adverse developments on the international
front.
</P>
<P>
The foundation of Malaysia's future economic growth has been

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Libraries Play Important Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- New Zealanders borrowed 34
million items from the 15 largest public libraries in the country
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
This equates to 15 items for every man, woman and child living
in cities across New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
In its press release, MetroNet, the incorporated society of
large, metropolitan libraries serving populations of 50,000 and
above, said Monday that the figures clearly indicate that
libraries in New Zealand continue to play an important role.
</P>
<P>
Spokesperson for MetroNet Sue Sutherland said in the press
release that New Zealanders are using their libraries as much as
ever.
</P>
<P>
"Whether it is to borrow books, magazines, CDs or videos, or to
use the Internet or other web-based resources, libraries are
continuing to fulfill the recreation and information needs of
their users," she said.
</P>
<P>
According to the release, librarians also answered nearly 4
million reference inquiries in 1999.
</P>
<P>
NetroNet was incorporated in 1999 to improve standards of
service, enable joint ventures and consortia projects, share
information and learning and raise the profile of public libraries

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Sets Up New Refuge for Black Robin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Pitt Island in the Chatham
Islands, which is 800 kilometers from New Zealand's east coast,
was designated Monday as a new refuge for the black robin, one of
the world's rarest birds.
</P>
<P>
According to an announcement from the New Zealand Department of
Conservation (DOC), the numbers of black robins have increased
from a low of only five birds in 1979 to a current population of
more than 250. Although New Zealand already has two island
reserves for the black robin, the increase of its population has
prompted DOC to set up a new sanctuary on Pitt Island.
</P>
<P>
Hillary Aikman, a DOC official, said that work has begun on a
fence to keep out pests and DOC should be able to transfer black
robins there next year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Benefit From Holiday Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese farmers have had another
source of income as an increasing number of urbanites are flocking
to the countryside for holidays.
</P>
<P>
The all-year-round busy farmers never expected that holidays
had anything to do with them. But now, some better-off urbanites
have begun to visit farmers' courtyards, vegetable or tea gardens
when touring rural areas, according to an article in today's
People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
To farmers' surprise and pleasure, urban visitors are willing
to pay for tea picking.
</P>
<P>
The change in the way urbanites enjoy their leisure time has
brought market economy nearer to the countryside, making it
possible for farmers to get adapted much more quickly to market
competition, the article said.
</P>
<P>
However, the article argued that farmers should first turn
their hospitality and enthusiasm into various services compatible
with market economy in a bid to not only increase tangible
benefits but also improve their quality.
</P>
<P>
Holiday consumption in urban areas has brought along holiday
economy, which has been extended to rural areas as a link to
promote domestic demand as a whole, the article said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese farmers' per-capita income is a bit over 2,000 yuan,
compared with over 5,000 yuan for urbanites.

TOKYO, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Share prices nose-dived across the
board in Tokyo Monday morning, dampened by last Friday's plunge on
the Wall Street, with the key Nikkei index briefly losing more
than 1,800 points.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange declined 1,750.79 points, or 8.
57 percent, to end the morning session at 18,683.89.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, tumbled 130.53 points or 7.89 percent to 1,
523.17.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section increased to 474.12 million
shares from last Friday morning's 396.02 million shares.
</P>
<P>
High-priced telecommunication issues faced selling while
exporters were lower, reflecting the weakness on the Wall Street
and the yen's rise.
</P>
<P>
The worst performer was the brokerage industry, falling 14.64
percent.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors, the major driving force in the Tokyo stock
market, were net sellers.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, losers overwhelmed
gainers 1,233 to 49, with 36 issues unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The plunge in the stock market prompted a senior official of
Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to announce
emergency measures to cope with the situation.
</P>
<P>
"As emergency measures, the LDP wants to prop up the stock
market with such steps as an injection of public funds. I am
thinking of an injection of at least one trillion yen (about 9.6
billion U.S. dollars) in public funds," Shizuka Kamei, chairman of
the LDP's Policy Research Council, told reporters early in the day.

at open on Singapore Stock Market on Monday morning as the
benchmark Singapore Straits Time Index plunged to 2,011.72 points
by 178.04 points or 8.1 percent in the first trading hour from
0900 am to 1000 am dragged down by the Friday collapse of U.S.

<HEADLINE> IMF Pledges to Conduct Policy Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) Sunday pledged to continue to work toward making the
agency more effective, transparent and accountable so it can
better prevent financial crises.
</P>
<P>
The pledge was contained in a nine-page communique issued at
the end of the opening session of the International Monetary and
Financial Committee of the IMF.
</P>
<P>
The committee, the policy-making group of the IMF, also said it
will seek greater debt relief for the poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
"The Committee reaffirms its strong support for the IMF's
unique role as the cornerstone of the international monetary and
financial system and its ability, by virtue of its universal
character, to help all of its members," the communique said.
</P>
<P>
It said with the support of all its members, the IMF has
undergone continuous change to equip itself better to assist
members to build the strong macroeconomic and institutional
underpinnings required for international financial stability and
the broader sharing of the benefits and opportunities of an open
world economy.
</P>
<P>
The committee reiterates the critical importance of open and
competitive markets as a key component of efforts to sustain
growth and stability in the global economy and to reduce poverty,
the communique said. "Improving access to industrial country
markets for products of developing countries will be crucial to
support their reform efforts."
</P>
<P>
The communique directed the IMF's 24-member executive board,
which runs the agency on a daily basis, to explore ways to monitor
world economies more closely. It said work would continue on
efforts to better measure the performance of banks and other
financial institutions and monitor the buildup of countries'
foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
On debt relief, the policy group repeated its goal of having
more countries qualify this year for reduction in debt payments.
So far, only Uganda has seen any cuts in its debt bills from the
initiative. Four other countries are in the process of qualifying
for relief.
</P>
<P>
The committee has set out a number of principles that should
underpin this review, including the need to preserve the IMF's
ability to provide and catalyze financial support to all member
countries according to individual country circumstances and with
due consideration of social implications.
</P>
<P>
"The IMF must retain the ability to help countries respond
quickly and effectively to short-run balance of payments problems,
" the communique said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF's current efforts on policy reforms, debt relief and
other matters have been criticized as inadequate by anti-
globalization activists, including those outside the headquarters
of the IMF and World Bank who failed to shut down the opening
meeting but did make getting to the session difficult.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting went on as normal. It started on time and it was
completed in a normal way," said British Chancellor of the
Exchequer Gordon Brown at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meetings of the World Bank and the IMF will
continue Monday with a day-long session of the Development
Committee, the policy-setting group for the World Bank.

<HEADLINE> Chinese-Americans Urge Congressmen Supporting PNTR For China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on China's
PNTR status on May 22 and the Senate will do the same later. Some
Congressmen are under pressure from human right, environmental and
union groups, who threaten that, in November, they will vote
against those who support for China's PNTR status in May.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in Los Angels, the Chinese-Americans
voiced counter threats that, in November, they will vote for those
Congressmen if they support China's PNTR status in may, and vote
against those Congressmen if they vote against China's PNTR status.
</P>
<P>
"As ordinary Americans, we are deeply concerned about this issue
which is critical to us, our families, our businesses, and our
very future," the Chinese-Americans explained in a open letter to
U.S. senators and house of representatives.
</P>
<P>
"We trust that your wisdom and foresight will guide you to
support and vote to grant PNTR status to China. We simply cannot
afford to miss this great opportunity," said the letter.
</P>
<P>
Also on Sunday, the Chinese-Americans launched a 10-day
campaign for collecting signatures from Chinese communities in
Southern California, appealing to the U.S. Congress to approve the
bill.
</P>
<P>
The organizers said they are confident to collect more than 10,
000 signatures before April 25 and will send them, along with the
open letter, to the Capital Hill in Washington D.C. as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
"Without PNTR for China, American companies and their workers
will be denied their great opportunities to prosper and profit
from China's booming economy, and American industrial and
agricultural products and services will be substantially excluding
from China's huge market," said Yuan Chen, one of the organizers
whose company is doing business across Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Last fall, the U.S. and Chinese governments successfully
negotiated the provisions related to China's entry into the World
Trade organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Most Chinese-Americans believe that the U.S.-China WTO
agreement represents a historic opportunity to expand U.S.-China
trade in the new century.
</P>
<P>
As the most populous country in the world, China has sustained
continued high rate economic growth in recent years and is by far
the world's biggest and most important emerging market.
</P>
<P>
"China's open-market policy and WTO membership will create
spectacular new opportunities for American companies, workers,
farmers, and consumers," said Jie Win, another organizer, who
asked the Congressmen to take the advantage for the benefit of
ordinary Americans in their respected constituents.

<HEADLINE> 3 Arrested for Panicking Public in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Three local people in the Thai-
Myanmar border areas were arrested early this month for plotting
to panic the public during the just-ended three-day Water Festival
and to perpetrate subversive activities at busy places in the
capital of Yangon, a local newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar Monday,
the three persons, said to have been sent by a group called the "
People's Power-21st Century (PP-21)" based in Thailand, were
arrested with explosive powder and electric detonators by the
Myanmar Defense Services Intelligence units in Myawaddy and
Kyondoe, Myanmar border towns opposite to Thailand, on April 1 and
11.
</P>
<P>
Organized with members of the All Burma Students' Democratic
Front and Kayin National Union, two of the anti-government armed
groups operating on the Thai-Myanmar border, the PP-21 group is
said to have been formed in Thailand's Chiangmai in 1998,
financially backed by a non-governmental organization from Norway
named "Political Defiance Burma."
</P>
<P>
The authorities are taking action against the three, the report
said.

<HEADLINE> Remittance by Expatriate S.Lankan Workers Up 23 Pct in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Expatriate Sri Lankan workers
remitted 74 billion rupees (1,056 million U.S. dollars) in 1999, a
23 percent increase in rupee terms over the previous year, the
official Daily News reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Some 60 percent of this remittance was sent in by housemaids,
Foreign Employment Bureau officials were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
There are some 1.2 million Sri Lankans working abroad, mostly
in Middle East countries, as housemaids.
</P>
<P>
Expatriate workers represented a major source of foreign income
for the country and accordingly all efforts were made to find
foreign employment for Sri Lankans, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report said there are lucrative employment opportunities
for Sri Lankans in Cyprus, Singapore, Malaysia and China's Hong
Kong. The salaries paid in these countries and regions were better
than those paid in Middle East countries, where the decline in
wages was attributed to an influx of housemaids from other Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Employment Bureau is now encouraging male workers
to seek employment abroad as many problems in society is traced to
the absence of housewives in households here.
</P>
<P>
There has been an increasing demand for skilled workers such as
welders, painters, electricians and plumbers in Middle East
countries,the report added.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Be Flooded With Drug Pills: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Up to 400 million methamphetamine
pills are expected to end up on the streets in Thailand this year,
despite the best efforts of suppression agencies, the Bangkok Post
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a report of the Thai Farmers Research Center, the
report said widespread acceptance of the drug by laborers and
their families, who viewed it as a means of overcoming fatigue,
working longer and boosting income, is a major problem.
</P>
<P>
Estimated illegal sales could reach 50 billion baht (1.33
billion U.S. dollars), the center reported. When medical costs and
other programs were included, the total cost to society would be
more than 100 billion baht (2.66 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The report said the Thai government was finding it hard to
suppress methamphetamine because of the ease of its production,
high demand and profitability.
</P>
<P>
A survey of 728 laborers in Bangkok recently found many were
addicted to methamphetamine and viewed the drug only as a
stimulant, not a narcotic, and about 89 percent of the respondents
said they needed a stimulant to work hard without feeling
exhausted.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, their families considered their drug abuse as an act
of devotion to income-earning, thus boosting the popularity of
methamphetamine among laborers.
</P>
<P>
The center estimated the customer base of methamphetamine among
laborers in Bangkok at 200,000-300,000 people, making the capital
a major market worth hundreds of millions of baht in annual sales.
</P>
<P>
It suggested the government not only tackle the supply of
methamphetamine by arresting traffickers but also try to reduce
demand through education and make greater efforts to rehabilitate
addicts.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Accuses Ethnic Albanians of Attacking Serbians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Attacks by ethnic Albanian
extremists on non-ethnic Albanian residents have been escalating
under the connivance of the U.N. peacekeeping force in Kosovo, the
Yugoslav News Agency Tanjug said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, some ethnic Albanians burnt down 250 Serbian
houses in a village in Pechi and the last two Serbian houses left
in Urosevac region. Serbian residents have fled their hometown
for fear of terrorist attacks by ethnic Albanians since the
peacekeeping force entered Kosovo last June, Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
Before the houses were set on fire, ethnic Albanian extremists
loaded 15 trucks with electrical appliances and furniture robbed
from those houses. Local observers said the attacks aimed to
prevent Serbians from returning to their hometown.
</P>
<P>
The news agency condemned the peacekeeping force for turning a
blind eye on the violence and did not take any action to stop it.
</P>
<P>
According to Yugoslav official statistics, there have been 4,
360 attacks in Kosovo since last June, leaving nearly 1,000 people
dead and 50,000 houses burnt down, and forcing 360,000 non-ethnic

<HEADLINE> Northeast China Province Shifts to Stock Raising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Over output of agricultural
products, grains in particular, and the reduction of prices, have
made the Liaoning provincial government in northeast China to
devote more efforts to stock raising with a view to increasing
farmers' income.
</P>
<P>
Song Shucai, provincial official in charge of stock raising,
said that they plan to raise the livestock industry by 54 percent
within the next five years, turning the province into a major
force in the sector.
</P>
<P>
Central government's decision on the agricultural restructuring
with the aim to increase rural income and improve the quality of
rural economy, together with the abolishment of subsidy on wheat
yield, has forced the province to resolve the oversupply of grains.
</P>
<P>
The province, one of the main grain producers in the country,
has in all allocated an amount of 7.5 million yuan ( about 900,000
U.S. dollar) in improving 45 livestock raising centers, and
introducing over 900 boars since last year.
</P>
<P>
It has also been trying to build up a comprehensive breeding
system in the province, to maintain the production of chicken and
meat, and to increase the proportion of livestock raising in
agricultural economy, said Song.
</P>
<P>
The state has made a strong emphasis on the market-oriented
production in agriculture this year, calling on the farmers to
make timely shifts according to the real needs of the markets both
at home and abroad, and eco-friendly and sustainable development
of agriculture has also been strongly supported.
</P>
<P>
The central government is to reduce the grain yield by 10
million tons to 490 million tons for the whole nation this year.
The bumper harvest in the consecutive years has brought the
Central government heavier financial burden in surplus grains
storage. And the lower purchasing prices have made grain growing
less profitable.
</P>
<P>
The province has so far invested 950,000 yuan in building 173,
000 hectares of pasture to improve its ecological condition. And
the growth rate of the livestock industry is expected to be around
seven percent.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank's loans in the beef processing industry has
also inspired the rural people to take up cattle raising.

<P>
TAIYUAN, April 17 (Xinhua) -- North China's water-deficient
Shanxi Province has been launching a three-year program that will
help quench the drinking water shortage for the province's 2.4
million poor farmers.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the entire program will cost 720
million yuan (about 86.75 million U.S. dollars), said local
sources.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government will raise 240 million yuan this year
which will mainly be used to ease the drinking water shortage
first for 630,000 rural people in the province's 22 counties.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi is dubbed as the "sea of coal", but has suffered
enormously from a lack of water resources. The situation has
resulted in a limited economic development in the province's rural
areas, especially mountainous regions, and a great number of poor
farmers living under absolute poverty.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's AGO Plans to Seize Soeharto's Assets: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Attorney General's
Office (AGO) is planning to block former president Soeharto's
accounts and seize his properties as a precautionary measure to
safeguard the corruption investigation of the former ruler,
according to the Jakarta Post Monday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a high-ranking official at the AGO as saying
that his office would soon take measures to secure Soeharto's
accounts.
</P>
<P>
"Whether they are Soeharto's private accounts or under the
charity foundations, we will block them," he said, adding that
only accounts suspected of being related to the corruption case
would be blocked.
</P>
<P>
But he would not say whether his office had already conferred
with Bank Indonesia about this plan.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto, who was forced to step down in May 1998 after 32
years in power, is accused of massive corruption and power abuse.
</P>
<P>
The investigation of Soeharto intensified over the past week,
with the former president placed under city arrest and an overseas
travel ban imposed. A summons has also been issued to question two
of his children.
</P>
<P>
But the questioning of Soeharto was impeded when an independent
medical team from Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital declared
last week the 78-year-old Soeharto unfit to face further
questioning, suggesting Soeharto undergo more comprehensive
medical tests.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. business magazine Forbes last year estimated Soeharto's
family fortune at some 4 billion U.S. dollars. The Time magazine
of the U.S. has put the figure at about 15 billion dollars.

the Danareksa Research Institute.

despite domestic social and political uncertainties.

"The positive expectations typically point to the active pace
of economic recovery underway and underline the characteristics of
an economy that is at the incipient stage of a business cycle
upswing,"the Institute said.
</P>
<P>
Although the majority still believed jobs were difficult to
find,the proportions of optimistic responses was increasing
compared with the February survey.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has been under the intensive care of the
International Monetary Fund after the economy was hit by the
economic crisis that started in the middle of 1997.
</P>
<P>
But there are signs that the economy is improving. Bank
Indonesia expressed confidence last week that the 3 percent to 4
percent gross domestic growth and "underline" inflation of 3
percent to 5 percent target of this year could be attained.

CHENGDU, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Natural forest in Sichuan
Province in southwest China has increased due to logging bans
issued by the provincial government in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Since then, 280,000 hectares of trees have been planted and 1.5
million hectares of mountains sealed to protect trees.
</P>
<P>
According to provincial forestry department, by the end of 1999,
172 counties had stopped logging primitive forest and tens of
thousands of lumberjacks became tree planters.
</P>
<P>
The department has made the protection of primitive forest one
of its two key projects. The province will plant 140,000 hectares
of forest and seal mountains to protect 690,000 hectares of forest
a year.
</P>
<P>
Due to excessive logging in the past, Sichuan's primitive
forest has decreased year by year, resulting in serious soil
erosion. About 600 million tons of mud and sand are washed into
the Yangtze River each year.

Shanghai has seen a total of 275 billion yuan (33 billion U.S.
dollars) of investment in fixed assets over the past 10 years. .
</P>
<P>
Pudong will celebrate its tenth anniversary on April 18. The
new economic district was set up to rejuvenate Shanghai's status
as an international financial and trade center and promote
economic development in the Yangtze River valley.
</P>
<P>
In the first five years of the construction of Pudong, priority
has been given to building the road links, telecommunications
facilities and the energy systems. The Yangpu and Nanpu bridges
were built into the longest and third longest cable-stayed bridges
in the world.
</P>
<P>
In the second five years, 100 billion yuan (12 billion US
dollars) was spent on building an airport, an information hub and
deep-water port. The Pudong International Airport, Waigaoqiao Port
Bonded Zone, Pudong Information Hub, the No.2 Subway Line,
External Ring Road, East China Sea Natural Gas Transportation
System, Sewage Treatment Plant and the International Conference
Center were all completed during this period.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Ranks First in China in Social Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 17 (Xinhua) -- China's leading industrial and
commercial city Shanghai ranks first in economic and social
development among all the provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities on the Chinese mainland, a research has shown.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Qingfang, a researcher from the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, found that Shanghai met the modernization standards in
terms of ten major indexes in 1998, based on statistics released
by the National Bureau of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
The 10 indexes are: per capita gross domestic product (GDP),
the share of non-agriculture output in the total GDP, the portion
of the services sector output in the total GDP, the ratio of
urbanites to the total population, the share of non-agricultural
employees in the total employment, the share of university
students among people aged between 22 and 24, the net population
growth rate, the average life expectancy, the number of doctors
and the literacy rate for adults.
</P>
<P>
Zhu found that Shanghai scored the highest in economic and
social development in 1998, exceeding Beijing for the first time.
</P>
<P>
The research shows that Shanghai ranked the first on China's
mainland in several aspects: The share of non-agriculture
population was 73 percent of its total population, the per capita
GDP was 28,253 yuan (3,403 U.S. dollars), per capita electricity
consumption amounted to 262.3 kilowatt hours, and there were more
than 5,000 telephones per 10,000 people. In the meantime,
consumption and income of its urban and rural residents also
ranked first.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai ranked the 27th among the world's 83 leading cities in
terms of overall social development in 1998, the researcher found.

<HEADLINE> More Hydropower Stations to be Built Along Yellow River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- China plans to build 25 major
hydropower stations in the upper reaches of the Yellow River in
the next five years, according to a government source here.
</P>
<P>
The 25 large and medium-sized power stations, the country's
largest staircase power station group when completed, will be
built along the 918 kilometers of the river. Up to ten billion
kilowatt/hour of electricity will be generated to ease the power
shortage in the east and central Chinese provinces.
</P>
<P>
With abundant water resources and great drops, the upper
reaches of the Yellow River is known as an ideal place for
hydropower development. By now, seven major hydropower stations
such as Lijiaxia, Liujiaxia and Qingtongxia, have been built with
the combined installed capacity of 5.61 million kilowatt/hour.
</P>
<P>
However, only 35.3 percent of the hydropower resources have
been utilized in the region. Some 20 sites are waiting for
exploitation in the upper reaches of the river.

<HEADLINE> China's Export Situation Still Not Optimistic: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 17 (Xinhua) -- It is still too early to be
optimistic about an increase in China's exports this year, despite
the fast growth in exports in the past few months, said a senior
Chinese trade official.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Keren, vice-minister of the Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, said a series of preferential policies introduced
last year would continue to be implemented this year.
</P>
<P>
China's exports growth rate fell as a result of the Asian
financial crisis last year. "The export growth in the first three-
month period this year was based on the low figures of last year,"
said the official at a national meeting on export work.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China's total trade stood at 98.22 billion
US dollars in the first quarter of this year, up 40 percent on a
yearly basis, with exports reaching 51.72 billion US dollars, up
39.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The country increased the exports to all its major trade
partners. China's exports to the Republic of Korea, Japan, the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations, European Union and the
United States increased 57, 30.4, 41.5, 39.3 and 32.8 percent,
respectively. Those to Hong Kong, Russia and South Africa, were up
48.3, 76 and 72.5 percent, respectively in the three-month period,
while the country's exports to these areas decreased last year.
</P>
<P>
A top priority in China's foreign trade work is to increase
exports by all means in 2000, he said. Zhou said his Ministry will
entitle the right to export to more state-owned or private
enterprises this year, Zhou added.

BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) -- A public health official said the
Chinese government would do more to help the estimated 15 million
Chinese suffering from mental illness, including drafting a law to
protect their rights and increasing public awareness to end the
discrimination and marginalization faced by patients.
</P>
<P>
"Mental illness is now such a serious problem that we have to
face it whether we want to or not," Yin Dakui, vice-minister of
health was quoted by China Daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks last week at a special auction held to sell
artwork by patients suffering from mental illness to raise fund

</P>
<P>
Yin said the government is now carrying out a publicity
campaign to improve people's awareness of mental illness.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese people are often unwilling to admit that
they or their relatives have mental disorders until suicides are
committed.
</P>
<P>
"Discrimination against mental patients is so wide-spread it
has become the biggest obstacle to treating mental illness," he
said.
</P>

According to the law being drafted, employers cannot fire
employees just because they have mental diseases, he said.

<HEADLINE> More Efforts Urged to Improve Environment in North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Environmentalists have called for
more afforestation efforts in the wake of the dust and sand storms
that hit Beijing, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Shaanxi
Province, and other parts of north China this spring.
</P>
<P>
Low vegetation coverage rate is to blame for the dust and sand
storms, according to meteorologists, and the forest coverage is
less than one percent in some areas in north China.
</P>
<P>
Air quality in northwest China and north China deteriorated
during the sand and dust storms, which even affected Qingdao, a
beautiful coastal city in east China's Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
The China Environment Monitoring Station reported that the
intensity of dust particles in the air in Beijing, Taiyuan,
Lanzhou and Hohhot increased recently.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists said the dust and sand storms were brought about
by strong cold air that visited north China, where there had been
little rainfall this spring. Other factors included higher
temperature in early spring and softened earth.
</P>
<P>
Being aware of the urgency of improving the environment, the
Chinese government has decided to build forest shelter belts on a
large scale in northwest China while accelerating the development
of the western part of the country. Farmers have been encouraged
to plant more trees by retiring fragile farmland.

DAMASCUS, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Prime Minister Mohammed
Mustafa Miro held talks with his visiting Canadian counterpart Jean
Chretien Monday, but no details of the discussion were disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The official Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) quoted Canadian
Ambassador Alexandra Bugailiskis as saying that Chretien's two-day
visit to Syria is to boost bilateral ties and sound out Syrian
government's views on the peace process with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Syrian-Israeli peace talks that resumed last December after a
45-month hiatus hit a snag again in January due to Israel's refusal
to commit itself to full withdrawal from the Golan Heights it
seized from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
Canada prefers to remain neutral and help both sides arrive at
acceptable solutions, the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
Syria is part of Chretien's regional tour, which has taken him
to Jordan, Israel, the Palestinian territories, Egypt and Lebanon,
and he will travel on to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Chretien is also expected to meet with Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad.

A Canadian contingent of 180 troops serves in the U.N. observer
force on the Golan Heights.

Canada also chairs the refugee committee for the regional
multilateral peace process talks.

<P>
GAZA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Several Palestinian students were
injured when a demonstration marking the "Captive Day" turned to a
violent clash with the Israeli forces in the West Bank city of
Bethlehem on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli forces resorted to violence to stop the march of
Palestinian students around Belal Mosque, north Bethlehem, the
Palestinian News Agency (WAFA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli forces fired rubber bullets and tear gas bombs at
the students. Many students suffered injuries, coma and
suffocation. Eyewitnesses said four students sustained bullet
injuries after they stoned the Israeli forces.
</P>
<P>
All the Palestinian towns in the West Bank and Gaza Strip

Meanwhile, Chairman of the Palestinian National Authority Yasser
Arafat told reporters here this afternoon after his meeting with
Omani Foreign Minister Yousef Bin Alawi Bin Abdullah that he always
stands by the Palestinian detainees.
</P>
<P>
Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council Ahmed Qureia was
quoted by WAFA as saying that the detainee issue is on top of the
PLC priorities. He condemned Israel for procrastinating the
implementation of the peace accords that provide clearly for
releasing all the Palestinian detainees.
</P>
<P>
Since the signing of the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum with the
Palestinian last September, Israel has released 400 Palestinian
political detainees.

<HEADLINE> Greek FM Willing to Meet Turkish Cypriot Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou has expressed his willingness to meet with Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, the Macedonian Press Agency (MPA)
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Denktash said recently that he intended to meet with
Papandreou, who said that he would gladly meet with Denktash when
they, as European citizens, would be able to cross Cyprus from end
to end, without technical or other obstacles.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-controlled
south and the Turkish Cypriots-dominated north since 1974 when
Turkey invaded and occupied the northern third of the island in
the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Greece, a major supporter of the Cyprus Republic-led Galfcos
Clerides, has insisted that the Cyprus issue must be resolved on
the basis of the establishment of a bizonal, bicommunal federation
in line with U.N. resolutions, but Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot
side demand that northern Cyprus, illegally declared in 1983, be
recognized internationally as a prelude to reunification in the
form of a two-state confederation.
</P>
<P>
In Athens, the two-day low-level policy talks between Greek
and Turkish foreign ministry officials got underway Monday. Both
sides are focusing on bilateral cooperation in the European Union
(EU) program.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the recent rapprochement between Athens
and Ankara will help resolve the protracted Cyprus issue.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Danube Monday reached 624
cm high in the eastern Romanian county of Braila, the highest
level during the latest years, the county's Committee on Defense
against Disasters said.
</P>
<P>
At this level, the river's waters flooded the Braila harbor's
quay, at its lower places, and thus the road linking the ferry
station and the dam became impassable for cars. Water infiltration
was also reported at almost all the dammed sectors.
</P>
<P>
The Danube started growing at a fast amble since last Thursday
as a result of the floods in Romania's inland rivers during the
past two weeks when eight casualties and heavy damage were
reported.
</P>
<P>
Consolidation of the Danube's dams and banks was run during the
last week and speed restrictions were imposed upon the ships
sailing in the Braila area.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Telesat Canada has authorized
Hughes Space &AMP; Communications International to build its Anik F2
communications satellite, the Ottawa-based satellite operator
announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
Anik F2, which is estimated to cost 600 million Canadian
dollars (about 408 million U.S. dollars), "will be the most
advanced satellite Telesat has ever launched," said Larry Boisvert,
president of Telesat Canada.
</P>
<P>
"As the newest in Telesat's fleet of satellites, Anik F2 will
provide valuable capacity for North American customers with
telecommunications, broadcasting and multimedia needs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Anik F2, to be launched in late 2002, will carry a Ka-band high-
speed, multimedia communications payload worth 109 million
Canadian dollars (about 74 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The highly advanced communications satellite will also include
C-band and Ku-band payloads to replace the existing capacity on
the Anik E satellites when they reach the end of their service
lives.
</P>
<P>
Hughes is the manufacturer of Telesat's Anik F1 satellite,
which will go into space late this summer, according to the
Canadian satellite company.

UNITED NATIONS, April 17 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Monday expressed the hope that the airport explosion of
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DDR) would not hamper the peace
process in the country.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by his spokesman's office, Annan
conveyed his sympathies to the government and people of the DDR
and his deepest condolences to the families of the deceased.
</P>
<P>
Annan hoped the incident would not affect implementation of a
ceasefire and a disengagement of forces agreed on earlier this
month by combatants.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the United Nations remained committed to the
earliest implementation of this agreement as well as to the
provision of humanitarian assistance.
</P>

According to reports reaching here, over 100 people died in a
series of large explosions at Kinshasa's Jdjili airport Friday.

<HEADLINE> Humanitarian Impact of U.N. Sanctions Urged to Be Addressed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All aspects of sanctions especially their effective monitoring
should be taken into full consideration before implementation,
said Ambassador Wang Yingfan when addressing an open debate on the
subject.
</P>
<P>
"We must attach adequate importance to addressing humanitarian
consequences created by sanctions, which have a direct bearing on
the humanitarian situation of thousands of innocent civilians," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said China is supportive of setting up an informal working
group to carry out a review of the Security Council's sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The group should conduct thorough investigations and come out
with concrete and feasible solutions in areas such as expansion of
humanitarian exemption, pre-analysis, post-evaluation, and should
set up criteria for the suspension or lift of sanctions, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Wang was among some 30 speakers at the debate.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said the record of
the sanctions imposed in the last decade "has raised serious
doubts not only about the effectiveness but also about their scope
and severity when innocent civilians often become victims not only
of their own government but of the actions of the international
community as well".
</P>
<P>
In the 1990s, the Security Council has invoked Chapter VII of
the U.N. Charter to impose sanctions in 14 cases, calling on
member states to apply measures not involving the use of armed
force to maintain or restore international peace and security.
Such measures are commonly referred to as sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan, Angola, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Iraq,
Liberia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Somalia and Sudan are still on the
list of U.N. sanctions.

ADDIS ABABA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- China on Monday donated
200,000 U.S. dollars to Ethiopia in support of the country's
effort to save millions of people facing starvation due to
prolonged drought.
</P>
<P>
Chinese ambassador to Ethiopia Jiang Zhenyun presented the
check to Simon Michele, chief of the Federal Disaster Prevention
and Preparedness Commission (DPPC).
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the Chinese government and people, who have been in

</P>
<P>
The ambassador stressed that the donation reflects the goodwill
of the Chinese people towards the Ethiopian people.
</P>
<P>
Simon said that the people of Ethiopia treasure the friendship
with the Chinese people. Although the latest donation by China is
not big, it has come at right time and will be very helpful to
Ethiopia's current relief work.
</P>
<P>
The donation made by the Chinese government clearly
demonstrates China's concern over the plight of drought afflicted
Ethiopians, Simon noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
THE HAGUE, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The government of the
Netherlands promised to China here Monday that it will continue to
uphold the one-China policy and actively support China's bid to
join the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
In her meeting with visiting Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing,
Vice Prime Minister Annemarie Jorritsma-Lebbink, who is also
minister for economic affairs, said the government of the
Netherlands attaches great importance to developing ties with
China.
</P>
<P>
She noted that in recent years, with the joint efforts of the
two governments, economic and trade relations between the two
countries developed rapidly, featuring many successful projects.
In the meantime, cooperation between the two countries in the
field of science and technology was strengthened, she added.
</P>
<P>
She said that the current official visit to the Netherlands by
the Chinese vice premier will help push forward the bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Li Lanqing, who arrived here Sunday on a three-day official
visit, agreed with his Holland counterpart, appreciating what he
described as "fruitful" cooperation between China and the
Netherlands in the areas of economy and trade, science and
technology, culture and education.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese government will continue to work
together with the Dutch government to further strengthen bilateral
cooperation in every possible field on the basis of mutual benefit
because this is in the long-term interests of the two nations.
</P>
<P>
In their talks, the Chinese vice premier also stressed that the
process of economic globalization should be pushed forward in a
healthy way.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, he said that efforts should be made to promote
multi-polarization of the world and to maintain the interests of
the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it is the obligation of the developed nations
to try to alleviate the debt burden of the developing nations and
truly open their markets to the products from the developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
As diversified the world is, Li said, the differences among
nations in their social systems, culture, history, and stages of
economic development should be respected.
</P>
<P>
Only by doing so can countries in the world co-exist peacefully
and achieve common development, he said.

<HEADLINE> Mexico's Popocatepetl Volcano Lets Out Ashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Volcano Popocateptl, 75
kilometers east of Mexico's capital, let forth Monday a cloud of
ashes that reached a height of 2,000 meters, said Monday official
sources.
</P>
<P>
This precipitation of ashes didn't cause damages, nor did this
volcano's new activity represent eventual danger for inhabitants
of neighboring areas, said Servando De La Cruz, an expert from
National Disaster Prevention Center (Cenapred).
</P>
<P>
De la Cruz disagreed with the theory that the letting out of
ashes is associated with an increase of the eruptive phase of this
volcano of 5,450 meters, situated in Puebla state.
</P>
<P>
According to this expert, the expulsion of ashes corresponds to
the destruction of a lava dome formed last February 26 inside the
volcano. Cenapred, under Secretariat of Government, is keeping a
yellow alert regarding the volcano.

<HEADLINE> World Finance Ministers Emphasize Importance of Trade, Poverty Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The ministers are of the view that accelerated and sustainable
growth is a necessary condition for reducing poverty and that more
open economies tend to grow faster than closed ones," said a
communique issued at the end of the one-day meeting of the
Development Committee, the policy-setting group of the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The communique said the ministers recognized that developed
countries have much to do to improve market access for developing
countries' exports, while developing countries need to implement
appropriately sequenced outward-oriented reforms that will permit
trade expansion to promote development and poverty reduction.
</P>
<P>
It said the majority of the poorest countries lag behind in
their integration into the world trading system, so additional
domestic and international reforms are needed, including special
consideration of enhanced market access for these countries.
</P>
<P>
"The ministers endorsed the commitment of the World Bank and
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to cooperate with other
parties in developing effective programs of capacity building for
trade, including through an improved Integrated Framework for
Trade Related Assistance for the Least Developed Countries," the
communique noted.
</P>
<P>
The Development Committee of the World Bank reiterated the
importance of the principle that all bilateral creditors should
participate fully in the provision of relief under the enhanced
initiative, while recognizing the need for flexibility in
exceptional cases.
</P>
<P>
Referring to poverty reduction strategies, the ministers called
on the IMF and the World Bank to allocate adequate resources to
support the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) process.
</P>
<P>
"The IMF and World Bank were urged to continue to work
collaboratively with member countries and other development
partners to develop full poverty reduction strategies, integrated
with macroeconomic and fiscal policies," the communique said.
</P>
<P>
On Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) debt initiative, the
ministers encouraged the governments of HIPC-eligible countries to
continue to work closely with the World Bank and the IMF as well
as other partners in pursuing sound policies and delivering
effective reform programs so that the delivery of HIPC debt relief
and the related poverty reduction strategies can move forward as
swiftly as possible.
</P>
<P>
The committee welcomed the establishment by the World Bank and
the IMF of a joint implementation committee (JIC) to facilitate
effective implementation of the enhanced HIPC initiative and the
new poverty reduction strategy approach.
</P>
<P>
Turning to action against HIV/AIDS, the communique said the
ministers emphasized that the HIV/AIDS epidemic, which has already
infected some 50 million people, is not only a very serious public
health concern and the cause of great human suffering, but also a
severe danger to development progress itself.
</P>
<P>
The ministers urged governments, international agencies, the
civil society, the media and the private sector, including the
pharmaceutical industry, to step up their efforts, building on
experience gained in on-going activities.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unveils Efficient Hybrid Fuel Cell Turbine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new device combines a fuel cell, which creates electricity
directly from natural gas, with a gas turbine that uses the hot
exhaust from the fuel cell to generate a second stream of
electricity.
</P>
<P>
The device represents the first mating of a fuel cell with a
gas turbine. It will generate power at 55 percent efficiency, 5
percent higher than the current generation of gas-fired power
plants. Its efficiency could exceed 70 percent with more
development.
</P>
<P>
The new power plant is capable of generating 220 kilowatts of
power, enough for more than 200 homes, according to the DOE.
</P>
<P>
Because no combustion occurs in the fuel cell, which creates
electricity by chemically breaking down the natural-gas fuel, the
pollution levels are drastically reduced.
</P>
<P>
The device produces no sulfur dioxide. Its output of nitrogen
oxide, which can turn into urban smog, will be 50 times as low as
current gas-fired power plants. And its emissions of carbon
dioxide, which is thought to be artificially warning the Earth's
atmosphere, will be reduced by 75 percent, said the DOE.
</P>
<P>
The power plant was developed by Siemens Westinghouse Inc., a
unit of Siemens AG, and will be tested for a year by Southern
California Edison to see how it performs in a commercial setting.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Two African ministers for
health and a World Health Organization (WHO) official Monday
stressed the need for urgent increased political and financial
commitment by the international community to substantially improve
the health situation in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the United Nations Economic and Social Council, Dr.
Ebrahim M. Samba, the WHO's regional director for Africa, said
that the disease burden in Africa continued to exacerbate the
problem of poverty and called for concerted efforts to break the
vicious cycle of ill-health, poverty and underdevelopment.
</P>
<P>
He welcomed the decision by G-8 in 1999 to introduce a wide-
ranging package of debt relief to developing countries, but noted
that 33 of 41 heavily indebted countries and 29 of the 35
countries with low human development index were in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"The debt burden has re-entrenched the indebted countries
deeper and deeper into the vicious cycle of poverty. We urge
bilateral and multilateral agencies to consider total debt
forgiveness," he said.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Health and Social Services of Namibia and current
Chairperson of the WHO Regional Committee for Africa Dr. Libertine
Amathila underlined the gravity of the health problems facing
African countries and appealed to the advanced countries to come
urgently to their assistance.
</P>
<P>
"The health situation in Africa has been worsened by the AIDS
epidemic. It has reversed some of the gains that were realized in
health development. The debt burden has impoverished many African
countries and made it impossible for them to provide affordable
interventions in an already weak health system," he said.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Health and Social Services of Guinea-Conakry Dr.
Kandjoura Drame called for better understanding of Africa's
problems and more prompt response to them by the developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed, "The health situation in Africa has been
aggravated by poverty, conflicts and the large number of refugees,
problems which can only be resolved through good governance,
resolution of conflicts, proper management of resources as well as
internal and external partnerships."

<HEADLINE> (Urgent) Clinton Decides Against Selling Destroyers to Taiwan (updated with details) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
decided Monday against the sale of four Aegis destroyers to Taiwan
but approved sale of long-range radar designed to detect missile
launches, AP quoted a senior U.S. official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who is in California on a tour of impoverished
communities, acted on the recommendation of top advisers who met
earlier in the day at the White House, said the official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon had recommended that the administration put off
Taiwan's request to buy new weapons, including the destroyers,
submarines and anti-submarine aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said the White House might face a showdown with
Congress over legislation to strengthen U.S. military ties with
Taiwan, a province of China.
</P>
<P>
Clinton administration officials have said they would recommend
a presidential veto if Congress tries to force the sale of arms to
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives passed the so-called Taiwan
Security Enhancement Act in February. The Clinton administration
said it may veto because it undermines the stability in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The White House said in a statement that it "strongly opposes"
the measure because it "would seriously diminish Taiwan's security
and undermine the important U.S. objective of stability in Asia."
The measure was sharply condemned by China. China is strongly
opposed to the sale of any weapons to Taiwan and has repeatedly
urged the United States to abide by the three joint communiques
governing Sino-U.S. relations and stop selling weapons to Taiwan.
