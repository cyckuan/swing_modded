YANKS SAID TO BE TRYING TO TRADE PETTITTE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The Yankees are actively trying to trade the
left-hander Andy Pettitte, and they will probably want to do so
before the July 31 trading deadline, according to officials with
other teams.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte has 72 victories over the past five seasons, more than
any other Yankee pitcher, and he pitched well in important
postseason victories in 1996 and 1998, when the Yankees won the
World Series. But he is 5-7 with a 5.56 earned run average this
year, and over his last 27 starts _ dating to July 14 of last year
_ Pettitte is 9-13 with a 5.56 ERA and has been inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, would not comment
on whether Pettitte was being dangled to other teams; Cashman
almost uniformly does not discuss possible trades in the month
leading up to the July 31 deadline. But other major league
executives, who spoke on the condition that they not be identified,
insist that the Yankees are making it clear they want to move
Pettitte, and move him now.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Stottlemyre, the Yankees' pitching coach, said Tuesday that
he had seen some good things from Pettitte. But the Yankees'
attempts to move Pettitte are probably as much related to payroll
concerns as they are to worries about his inconsistency.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte, 27, is making $5.95 million this year, and because he
will be eligible for salary arbitration in the off-season, he could
be in line to make from $7 million up next year _ when the Yankees
will be facing significant budget issues.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera, who both won their cases in
arbitration in February, must be kept, and as the Yankees' most
dominant assets, they will be in line for large raises over the $5
million and $4.25 million they are earning.
</P>
<P>
   David Cone, who was expected to be named to the all-star team on
Wednesday and who has proved that his arm is sound, can become a
free agent after this season; Cone will probably want to stay, and
the Yankees will try to keep him.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Clemens has the option of demanding a trade after this
season, and to keep Clemens in the fold, the Yankees may have to
renegotiate his $8.25 million salary.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Stanton, the Yankees' only left-handed reliever, will be a
free agent after this season, and the Yankees will want to re-sign
him or pursue a comparable left-hander, like Baltimore's Arthur
Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
   There are few ways for the Yankees to cut payroll to offset
these expected increases. Joe Girardi, their backup catcher, will
presumably not be kept at his current $3.4 million salary. Paul
O'Neill, the 36-year-old right fielder, could retire after this
season; but then the Yankees would have to identify and pay another
run producer to replace him.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte is one of the few pricey Yankees who is not locked into
a long-term deal, and he has been among the least efficient players
this season. So long as the Yankees believe it will be difficult
for him to rebound _ and their willingness to push his inclusion in
the Clemens trade talks last winter and, recently, in cursory
discussions regarding Anaheim's Chuck Finley suggest they have made
this decision _ they will gain payroll flexibility by moving
Pettitte in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are probably trying to move Pettitte now because
they do not want to be boxed into a negotiating corner during the
off-season. If the Yankees wait until after the season to trade
Pettitte, other teams could be less willing to make a deal, knowing
the Yankees might eventually choose not to tender Pettitte a
contract for 2000. Dealing Pettitte now places the Yankees in a
less desperate bargaining position.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte is the only left-hander in the Yankees' rotation, but
the Yankees are grooming another lefty in Triple-A. Ed Yarnall, who
began his career in the Mets' organization, has been throwing well
for Columbus, going 9-3 with a 3.46 ERA, allowing 90 hits and
striking out 104 in 101 1/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Yarnall, 23, does not have Pettitte's track record, or his
experience in the postseason. But considering Pettitte's recent
troubles _ and his particularly poor regular-season performances
against possible October opponents, Cleveland and Texas _ the trio
of Clemens, Cone and Orlando Hernandez would be the team's three
top postseason starters.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are also expected to continue their pursuit of
Finley, a 36-year-old left-hander, who is eligible to become a free
agent after this year. He is 4-9 with a 5.52 ERA.

YANKS SURVIVE SLUGFEST WITH TIGERS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ When Tiger Stadium closes this fall after its 88th
season, most of the misty-eyed reminiscences will be told by
hitters. Remember how the stands jutted out from right field, they
will say, and turned fly balls into home runs? Remember those short
power alleys in right- and left-center, and that blue background
framing every pitch, as if to place it on a tee?
</P>
<P>
   Batters will miss this old place, which will be replaced next
year by a park expected to favor pitchers. The Yankees and Tigers,
likely sharing their last series in Tiger Stadium, slammed away at
each other Tuesday night, in the 941st game between the two teams
here, in a celebration of offense.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who collected 17 hits, held leads of as many as
five runs before the Tigers' Bobby Higginson tied the score with a
two-out home run off Mariano Rivera in the bottom of the ninth, the
first home run allowed by Rivera since Aug. 14, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But then the Yankees answered in the 10th, Chili Davis hitting a
single to score Bernie Williams with the decisive run, in a 9-8
victory.
</P>
<P>
   At the midpoint of the 1999 season, the Yankees are 50-31, on a
pace to finish the year 100-62.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch, the Yankees' second baseman, had a couple of
hits, but he left the game after being hit by a pitch on his left
elbow in the seventh inning. Knoblauch _ who has been hit by
pitches 15 times this year, tied for the most in the American
League _ went to first base in apparent pain, and in the bottom of
the seventh, he was replaced on defense by Luis Sojo.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch was hit an inning after Detroit's Damion Easley had
been hit, and after Easley was hit again in the eighth, the
Yankees' Chad Curtis was nailed by a pitch in the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees held an 8-4 lead going into the bottom of the eighth
inning, but Mike Stanton allowed a single and a walk, and with one
out, Mariano Rivera, the Yankees' closer, relieved Stanton, in a
rare eighth-inning appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The situation for the Yankees went from bad to worse: Rivera hit
Easley with a pitch, loading the bases; it was only the second time
in Rivera's 32 appearances that he allowed the first batter he
faced to reach base. The Tigers went on to score three runs in the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees 8, Tigers 7.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the fourth time this season Rivera had entered the
game in the eighth inning, and his strength may have waned as he
pitched in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera retired the first two batters in the inning, went to a
full count on Higginson and then threw a fastball right down the
middle. Higginson turned his hips and swung.
</P>
<P>
   The ball rocketed toward the right-field stands; there was no
question it was a home run. It was Higginson's first in 36 games,
and he slapped his bat to the ground. Rivera turned and gave one
big kick at the dirt, like Joe DiMaggio when he robbed of a home
run in the 1947 World Series. George Steinbrenner, watching from
the stands, grimaced. With the Yankees and Tigers moving into extra
innings, the game dragged past the four-hour mark.
</P>
<P>
   Williams beat out an infield hit with one out in the 10th, and
Tino Martinez and Davis followed with singles, Williams racing home
with the go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had this game in hand _ twice. Detroit starter Brian
Moehler (7-9), suspended earlier this season for having a piece of
sandpaper taped to the left thumb of his glove hand, needed a
foreign substance Tuesday night: the Yankees pounded him. Ten of
the 14 batters he faced reached base, most of them hitting the ball
very hard, to all the various spaces within Tiger Stadium, other
than the grandstands.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter doubled and so would Paul O'Neill. Bernie Williams
singled and Tino Martinez doubled and by then, the Yankees led,
6-1. Detroit pulled within two runs, at 6-4, but the Yankees added
two more runs in the seventh, in a rally built around three walks
and a hit batsman.  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   CLAREMONT, Calif. - Guard Latrell Sprewell says he wants to be
traded from the New York Knicks if he can't start.
</P>
<P>
   Texas outfielder Juan Gonzalez says he wants nothing to do with
the All-Star game if he can't start.
</P>
<P>
   There are athletes who can't see the funhouse for the mirror and
then there's Tisha Venturini, a reserve midfielder on the U.S.
Women's World Cup team who doesn't distort the big picture just
because she can't appear in every frame.
</P>
<P>
   Second-stringer Shannon MacMillan is the same way. Both
Venturini and MacMillan are richer for the perspective that the
Sprewells and the Gonzalezes must have misplaced a few million
dollars ago.
</P>
<P>
   As if anybody needed another reason to latch onto the Nice
Girls, there's Venturini's take on Gonzalez's gripes and Sprewell's
perceived slights and their reflexive flight response.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't make any sense to me,'' Venturini said Tuesday as
she absently adjusted an ice pack wrapped around her tight right
quadricep following practice. ``I don't understand that thinking.
You are one of the best athletes in the world. You're doing the
sport you love and you're getting paid millions for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Just to be part of an All-Star team or a squad that advances to
the NBA Finals or the World Cup Finals, ``is such an honor in
itself,'' Venturini said.
</P>
<P>
   As Dave Letterman would say, from the mouths of Babes.
</P>
<P>
   Don't misunderstand. You can be a super sub without being a
satisfied one. Venturini and MacMillan ache to start. They were
collegiate stars not so long ago, at North Carolina and Portland,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Venturini, 26, was the college Player of the Year in 1994, the
Elton Brand of her sport and time. She has appeared in more
international matches than anybody on the U.S. team save stars
Kristine Lilly, Mia Hamm, Michelle Akers, Joy Fawcett, Julie Foudy
and Carla Overbeck.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've grown accustomed to a lead role, it's hard to accept
a bit part, no matter how prestigious the production. Venturini and
MacMillan will grant Sprewell and Gonzalez that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a starter all my life,'' Venturini said. ``So it
took me a little bit to get used to (coming off the bench).''
</P>
<P>
   MacMillan, 24, didn't merely get bumped to the bench, she was
shown the couch. Never mind Sprewell, MacMillan is the Avery
Johnson of the U.S. team. She was dropped from the national squad
before the 1995 World Cup and might have hung up her cleats in 1996
if Adidas hadn't signed her to a contract to wear theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Given a new lease on her life's calling, MacMillan made the 1996
Olympic team after originally being left off the squad. Using her
signature submarine shot, she went on to sink Norway in the
semifinals by scoring the game-winning goal in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   After the win against China in the gold-medal match, MacMillan
retreated to the background, behind Mia Hamm and Tiffeny Milbrett
and Cindy Parlow. There she stayed until last week when it came
time for the U.S. to play North Korea in a first-round game.
</P>
<P>
   MacMillan, given a rare start at forward, scored the first goal
and assisted Venturini, who also started, on two others in the
U.S.'s 3-0 win.
</P>
<P>
   Venturini celebrated her second goal with a double somersault.
Since then, fans have been flipping over her. The other day a young
man paraded before the team bus wearing a T-shirt that said, ``I
love Tisha. I'm your biggest fan.''
</P>
<P>
   Her teammates gave Venturini good-natured grief over that one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's flattering,'' Venturini said of the attention. ``It's
kind of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   It scares her now, to think how close she came to not giving
fame a chance. It's true. Venturini had her own Juan Gonzalez
moment a while back. She wasn't playing much and she wondered if it
was worth it to be such a small part of something so big.
</P>
<P>
   Her teammates kept her going, spouting encouragement, saying
things such as ``way to bust your butt.'' They made her feel she
was contributing and pretty soon she stopped relying on starts and
stats for confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   The validation is coming from all sides now. Little girls sprint
after the team bus and little boys beg for the players' autographs
and nobody walks away looking the least bit disappointed if the
signature on his or her T-shirt or program or piece of paper
doesn't read ``Mia Hamm.''
</P>
<P>
   While watching fans surround the team bus the other day,
Venturini had an epiphany. She realized the World Cup isn't about
individual moments, it's about 20 women making history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me feel really, really grateful to be a part of this
team,'' Venturini said, and there could be no mistaking hersincerity.

FILMMAKERS OF `BLAIR WITCH PROJECT' SAY EMOTION WAS KEY TO SCARY
MOVIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The premise is simple enough.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 21, 1994, three Montgomery College film students hike
into Maryland's Black Hills Forest to shoot a documentary on the
local legend, ``the Blair Witch.'' They disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, their film footage is found. It may be simple, but
it's a premise that warrants goosebumps even in the telling. It's
as chilling onscreen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blair Witch Project'' moved critic Roger Ebert to write:
</P>
<P>
   ``When was the last time you went to a movie and were actually
scared? Not spooked, shocked or having fun at being scared, but
completely horrified?''
</P>
<P>
   It's also taken on a life of its own, achieving near-cult status
with a Web site and hundreds of fans tapping into the history and
mythology of the Blair Witch even before the film opens in theaters
on July 16.
</P>
<P>
   This ``virtual reality'' phenomenon and scarefest is the
brainchild of two young University of Central Florida film
graduates, Dan Myrick and Ed Sanchez, who have known each other
since 1990 and who still call Orlando home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We met at film school, first semester,'' says Sanchez who,
with Myrick, recently visited Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez is the more outgoing of the duo and he shoots from the
hip with his stream-of-consciousness opinions. Myrick is thoughtful
and reserved. They have a finely balanced relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our best stuff comes when Ed comes to me with an idea. It's a
natural collaboration and makes the end product of what we do
individually even better,'' says Myrick.
</P>
<P>
   The two would be thrilled if their film became a regular on the
midnight movie circuit and they're also happy about the early,
positive praise after a screening shook up the Sundance Film
Festival in January. Yet they're wary of the overly lavish hype
that can kill a small film with unreal expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an experimental film,'' reminds Sanchez. ``We shot it
in October of '97. We shot it in only eight days. But we started
casting it in 1996. We thought of the idea in 1993.''
</P>
<P>
   It took a year to edit because the pair had 20 hours of footage,
all shot in real time in the forest and in a car.
</P>
<P>
   It also took a year to cast because they needed actors with
exceptionally strong improvisational skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a film where we essentially threw our actors out there
in the woods and let them make our movie for us,'' laughs Sanchez.
</P>
<P>
   Myrick says they were initially concerned with the big buzz at
Sundance because ``at the time we didn't want to let people down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worse to build a thing up and be let down than to not
expect anything. We're just happy the hype control mechanism is in
place as much as it can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he notes proudly ``The Blair Witch Project'' is one of
the few times ``where a movie is just one part of an overall
world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We created a realm that people can interact with, especially
with the Web site. There's even a comic book coming out. It's
become an alternate world that the movie itself is just a part of.
It proves if something is cool, entertaining and insightful as well
as emotional, people will engage.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez enthuses, ``There's even a guy at a software company who
has 1,500 employees and he's downloaded `Blair Witch' screensavers
on their computers and he's giving his employees the Friday opening
a half day off so they can go see the film.''
</P>
<P>
   All for a little movie based on old '70s TV shows like ``In
Search Of.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' admits Sanchez. ``Anything with Big Foot, the Loch
Ness monster or the yeti ... scenes with UFOs. That inspired us
more than any conventional film.''
</P>
<P>
   So what, besides the fascination with being scared to death,
makes this movie so different from say, ``Scream'' or ``Nightmare
On Elm Street?''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you try to scare people on film, the first couple movies
in a series are a trick,'' notes Sanchez. ```Blair' throws the
rules away and says you can't expect anything because you don't
know what's coming. There are no flags or triggers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've done,'' explains Myrick, ``is make an emotional
film. It operates on an emotional level. A lot of films coming out
now are full of techno-wizardry and that's cool if you're an
animator, but good films, whether scary, funny or whatever, tap
into some key emotional core.''
</P>
<P>
   The star of too many Hollywood horror films is no longer the
horror, Sanchez says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a monster, the star, the effects and that's not what
scares you. It's impressive, it looks nice. But what it ultimately
means when there's so much special effect is the filmmakers don't
trust their audience.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a prime directive to keep it real,'' says Myrick. ``We
also discussed `what do we show if we don't show the monster'? We
built this reality process and then trusted the instincts of our
actors. We hoped that the reality-based way we shot the film would
be scary. We took a risk. In the end it was what we wanted in that
we captured the moments off-camera.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fear is a lot easier to capture than drama or comedy because
it's primal,'' he adds. ``I mean, what scares the hell out of you?
It's universal. We've not all been in love but we've all been
scared. I love to hear about people, after they've seen the film,
who have some sense memory about a recollection from childhood. And
that's what the movie does. There's something subtextual about
knowing what happens to these people in advance.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez says they'll take the same approach no matter what kind
of movie they make together.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's at the heart of a film?'' he asks. ``Our next movie is
a comedy. So we ask each other `what makes us laugh?' We basically
just strip away the rules. If the film winds up following
convention, it does. There's no formula.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, we weren't taken seriously before `Blair' and we
didn't ever take ourselves seriously. We just wanted to prove we
aren't afraid to take chances. More than being thought of as
directors, I'd just like our production company, Haxan, to be
thought of as a place where you can't predict what's coming next.''
</P>
<P>
   Myrick adds, ``Yeah, where no matter what, if you see one of our
movies you'll know we had our hearts in what we did. It may flop,
it may not, but it'll be a ride. That's what I like about Jim
Jarmusch and John Sayles. They take chances and you have to respect
that. That's all I can ask for.''

SEATTLE EMERGENCY CREWS LEARNED LESSONS FROM BUS SHOOTING,
ACCIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ At just after 3 p.m. the day after Thanksgiving last
year, a gunman put a bullet into a Metro bus driver, sending the
bus plunging off the Aurora Bridge and triggering a chain of events
that would test the limits of Seattle's emergency medical services.
</P>
<P>
   Although emergency response crews are used to seeing
mind-chilling injuries from falls, shootings, suicides, collapsing
buildings, auto accidents and hazardous material spills, they
seldom find them all at once.
</P>
<P>
   The Aurora Bridge bus incident had all the characteristics of a
terrorist attack, said A.D. Vickery, deputy chief of special
operations for the Seattle Fire Department. ``It had mass
casualties, a crime scene, and the need for a coordinated
response.''
</P>
<P>
   The bus incident, which left three people dead, and the
department's response was the subject of a cover story in the June
issue of the Journal of Emergency Medical Services. In the
emergency response community, there has been steady interest in how
the bus incident was handled and what could be learned from it,
said Vickery, who has fielded calls from about 30 other emergency
departments around the country since the bus shooting six months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the shooting and bus plunge, the department
has made several changes in the way it handles MCIs, or ``mass
casualty incidents,'' including a proposed plan for better tracking
good Samaritans who respond to accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took a good hard look and found some ways to make the
operation more efficient,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of those rare, sunny November afternoons in Seattle
when Metro's Route 359 bus headed south onto the Aurora bridge
carrying 35 passengers toward downtown Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was a ``pow, pow,'' and the bus swerved.
</P>
<P>
   In the seconds that followed, the 40,000-pound articulated bus
careened into oncoming traffic, striking a van and turning around
before plummeting over the bridge deck and smashing into an
apartment building 50 feet below. In a surreal twist, the bus tore
apart, landing in a shrieking wreck just under the gaze of the
Fremont troll, a community landmark that lurks beneath the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Had gunman Silas Cool started shooting a few seconds later, the
bus and its passengers would have sunk into the Lake Washington
ship canal.
</P>
<P>
   Those killed were Mark McLaughlin, Herman Liebelt, a passenger,
and Cool, who turned the gun on himself. Thirty-two people were
injured.
</P>
<P>
   Vickery was off-duty at home when he got the call at 3:13 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first call said there was a ``bus in a building,''' he
said. As chief of special operations, his job was to plan for the
unplanned. He immediately headed for the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Driving toward the scene, his first thought was the bridge.
Already, his mind was planning for contingencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought possibly the bus might be hanging off the bridge,''
he said. ``My job was to make sure we got enough resources there.''
</P>
<P>
   The original response was designated ``heavy rescue _ major.''
</P>
<P>
   In a ``heavy rescue major'' incident, the department sends five
engine companies, two ladder trucks, a heavy rescue unit with
equipment to lift and move apart heavy objects, two aid cars, two
medic units, two battalion chiefs, a safety chief, and an aid unit
to resupply air for firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   As Vickery approached the scene, however, there were signs this
was going to be more than a heavy rescue operation. Three blocks
from the location, he was flagged down by a middle-age couple who'd
found a man in his mid-20s wandering in the street, cut, dazed and
disoriented. It was an ominous sign _ one of the first tasks in an
emergency response is to secure the scene to keep victims from
wandering away and potentially endangering themselves further.
</P>
<P>
   Vickery scooped the victim into his car and kept going. A block
later, he encountered the next of many unanticipated events that
day.
</P>
<P>
   Police, responding to the shooting, had already arrived at the
scene, but their unattended vehicles were blocking routes to the
accident site. Vickery went the rest of the way on foot.
</P>
<P>
   As medic units began arriving, they too had to abandon their
vehicles. One of the first aid units to arrive tried to squeeze
through on a narrow sidewalk, blowing out two tires.
</P>
<P>
   According to the incident report, ``responding units had to use
several alternate routes into the location or park away from the
scene and carry equipment in.'' The blocking problem also slowed
the inital set-up of a base of operation.
</P>
<P>
   Since the incident, the Seattle Fire Department has improved its
coordination with police to ensure access routes are preserved at
crime scenes, Vickery said.
</P>
<P>
   Within 15 minutes of the accident, Vickery and the incident
commander on scene upgraded the response to an mass casualty
incident.
</P>
<P>
   An MCI designation automatically dispatches two more medic
units, a medical services officer and administrator, another aid
car and additional ambulances. In all, 22 fire department units
responded to the accident scene as well as about 20 ambulances.
</P>
<P>
   What didn't get to the scene, however, was the MCI trailer, a
critical piece of equipment with backboards and other emergency
supplies for taking care of 30 patients.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the accident, the MCI trailer had to be hooked to
an engine and dragged to the scene. With all units already
dispatched, there were none left to hook it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was available, but we couldn't get it transported,''
Vickery said. Consequently, there was a shortage of backboards at
the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the department has begun outfitting a special MCI
van with enough equipment to take care of 100 patients. The van
will be able to get to the scene of an accident independent of any
other units, he said.
</P>
<P>
   There were other lessons learned from the bus incident.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the department has refined its system of patient
triage to speed it up. Rather than waste precious time taking vital
signs, first responders will rely more on what they can see and
touch to determine which patients need the most help. That will
streamline the process of getting patients to staging areas where
medics can stabilize them for treatment or transport.
</P>
<P>
   Another lesson that came out of that tragic afternoon was the
need for better identification of people's roles at the scene of an
accident. In the chaos that followed the crash, it was difficult to
tell who was who, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The department is considering equipping its new MCI van with
special vests to identify good Samaritans, especially those, such
as doctors or nurses, who are qualified to assist patients. It has
also purchased larger signs to mark patient treatment zones so
there's a clearer boundary between the most critically wounded
(``red'' priority), those needing immediate attention (``yellow''
priority) and the walking wounded (``green'' priority.)
</P>
<P>
   A review of the incident also recommended the department get
vests to identify supervisors in charge of triage, treatment and
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the department is looking at ways to track good
Samaritans after they've left the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The need for such a system was brought home after health
officials discovered one of the victims on the bus was
HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
   The department's post-incident analysis may have yielded areas
in need of improvement, but overall, the response was handled in a
safe, orderly and efficient manner, Vickery said.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-nine minutes into the accident, the last patient had been
transported to one of the seven emergency rooms taking bus victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the job we do, we're dealing with emergencies as they
develop. We can't allow ourselves to be overwhelmed,'' Vickery
said. ``We take it in pieces and control it piece by piece.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ As much of the eastern United States sagged Tuesday
under a second day of record high temperatures, officials
attributed at least eight deaths to the heat, and the New York
region struggled with maddening power failures that trapped people
in stifling elevators, cut air-conditioning to thousands of homes
and commercial buildings, and knocked out some subway service.
</P>
<P>
   In some of the New York City's poorest neighborhoods, many
residents huddled in darkness when, just after 10 p.m., power
suddenly failed in the entire area north of 155th Street in
Manhattan, a densely populated area of about three square miles.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Petta, a spokesman for Con Edison, said the power failure
occurred after six of 14 high-voltage cables that supply the area
failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You now have the same amount of electricity traveling across
far fewer lines,'' he said. ``Those lines are designed to carry a
certain amount of electricity, and when they begin to carry far
more, that is what is an overload. What happens is, in effect, like
giant fuses blowing, and then the whole network lost power. It is
very rapid.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday night, Con Edison officials still did not know how
long it would take to restore power to the area. ``I don't recall
in recent memory anything like this happening,'' Petta said.
</P>
<P>
   Ambulance crews in New York City responded Tuesday to more than
160 calls from people complaining of cramps and exhaustion from the
heat, and emergency officials said the heat may have contributed to
a number of heart attacks and at least three deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service reported that the temperature in
Central Park reached 101 degrees at 3:11 p.m. Tuesday, breaking the
record of 98 degrees for the date set in 1986. Temperatures were
expected to moderate this week with a cool front moving through the
region Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Summer school was canceled in Washington on Tuesday, the lights
were dimmed in much of the Massachusetts Statehouse and block
captains checked on the elderly in Philadelphia's row houses.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said, ``This is one of the
more difficult days the city has ever had in regard to heat.'' He
canceled a political fund-raising trip to Nantucket in
Massachusetts to deal with the heat emergency.
</P>
<P>
   In the city's first confirmed heat-related death, an autopsy
Tuesday revealed that Julia Johnson, 79, of Manhattan had died of
hyperthermia on Monday, said Ellen Borakove, spokeswoman for the
office of chief medical examiner. Mrs. Johnson was found
unconscious at home by a health care worker.
</P>
<P>
   Her body temperature was 108.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said two other people may have died from the heat. They
were described as a 40-year-old man whose Brooklyn home had a
temperature in excess of 108, and a 27-year-old man who died at
Interfaith Medical Center in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Their names were not released, but neighbors identified the
40-year-old as Samuel Mitchell, a handyman from the Park Slope
section of Brooklyn, who died early Tuesday morning at Brookdale
Hospital Medical Center. Neighbors were told that dehydration was
the cause of death. Herma Passely, 59, who shared a house with
Mitchell, said he never woke up after a back yard Fourth of July
party. ``He said he was tired, went to sleep early and that was
it,'' Mrs. Passely said.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said that while they expected the death toll to
climb, they were confident it would come nowhere near the hundreds
of deaths that Chicago experienced during a brutal heat wave in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``That number might grow a bit, but certainly it will not
approach what happened in the Midwest,'' said Jerome Hauer, the
director of the Mayor's Office of Emergency Management.
</P>
<P>
   The heat wave, combined with record demands for electricity, put
enormous pressure on the power system in the New York region and
elsewhere. Transformers overheated and burst into flames. Power
lines melted through from the heat and high use. In the dense
humidity, bolts of electricity arced across power lines, causing
short circuits.
</P>
<P>
   Utility companies first issued urgent appeals for customers to
conserve energy. Later, to ease the strain on power lines and
transformers and because of insufficient power reserves, the
companies reduced their voltage output by 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, power failures were reported throughout New York City,
Long Island, Westchester County, New Jersey and Connecticut. At
least 150,000 people were affected, officials estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene McGrath, chairman of Con Edison, attributed the power
failures to equipment breakdowns, not the power cutback. ``Those
problems come about from the cables overheating,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani scolded Con Edison officials for not giving city
officials more explicit warnings about the extent of the power
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Con Ed is its own entity unto itself, and sometimes they
notify us late and sometimes they notify us only when the problem
has already started,'' the mayor said. ``I think it's a cause of
great frustration, for me and my administration and every other
mayor that's ever had this job. They call you about 10 minutes
before there is a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   New York City activated its emergency operations center Tuesday,
and Giuliani appealed for residents to avoid strenuous activity and
stay indoors near fans and air-conditioners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember hotter days than the last several and
particularly hotter nights,'' he said at a news conference at City
Hall. ``We would like everyone to be very, very careful.''
</P>
<P>
   On average, city ambulances respond to 3,000 calls a day, but
fire officials said they expected to handle more than 4,000 calls
Tuesday. ``It could be the busiest day in the department's
history,'' one fire official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a great stress on our emergency system,'' Giuliani
said.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent cars from overheating in traffic, city officials shut
down some highway construction. To keep people from overheating,
sprinkler caps were placed on open fire hydrants, extra ambulances
were pressed into service, and cooling centers were opened in
dozens of senior citizen centers and community centers operated by
the New York City Housing Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, officials opened 15 schools across the city where
anyone could sleep in the comfort of air-conditioning, Hauer said.
Cots, food and blankets were supplied by the American Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   He and other city officials credited a heat plan devised in the
aftermath of the Chicago heat wave with averting a similar disaster
in New York City. Still, there were major concerns Tuesday night,
including worries about the low water pressure in some parts of the
city. The low pressure threatened to hamper firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   On a normal day, New York City consumes 1.2 billion gallons of
water. Tuesday, the city consumed about 1.8 billion gallons, much
of that additional use spilling from open fire hydrants, Hauer
said.
</P>
<P>
   The high water consumption left some areas, especially in
Brooklyn, vulnerable to fire. ``There are some areas we are still
concerned about,'' Hauer said, adding that fire officials were
combating the problem by installing more sprinkler heads on
hydrants.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   According to meteorologists, a heat wave of this size and
intensity requires three main ingredients, and all three were
present this week. The first two are clear skies and a large mass
of hot air. But the third ingredient is the most important: a wind
from the west, a wind that comes off the Catskills and the
Appalachian Mountains, compressing and heating as it descends, then
overwhelming the cooling on-shore breeze from the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the type of pattern that generates extreme heat across
the Northeast seaboard,'' said Todd Miner, a meteorologist for
Pennsylvania State University.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Tuesday was another day of unwelcome records, both
for weather observations and for power use. Though Tuesday's high
fell short of New York City's record of 106 in 1936, back-to-back
days of temperatures above 100 degrees are rare. The last time it
happened was in July 1993. On July 9 it was 101; the next day, it
was 102.
</P>
<P>
   Despite pleas to conserve energy, both Con Edison and the Long
Island Power Authority reported record demand for electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Across the city, building managers embarked on ``load shedding''
_ shutting down two elevators in a bank of eight, or turning off
unneeded pumps and exhaust fans. On Long Island, officials
persuaded the Long Island Rail Road to slow the acceleration of its
electric trains, also to save power. But those actions were not
enough.
</P>
<P>
   In Westchester County, 10,000 customers were without power late
Tuesday afternoon. Among the hardest hit were the towns of
Harrison, Rye, Port Chester and New Rochelle. The Westchester
Medical Center in Valhalla was forced to use backup power
generators.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, a spokesman for Public Service Electric and Gas
Co. said about 9,000 commercial and residential customers had no
power Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In the most serious incident, the spokesman said, the Englewood
Hospital was reported to be without power for a period because a
backup power generator failed. Fire officials there knew of no
deaths resulting from the power failure.
</P>
<P>
   And in Connecticut, most of the city of New London and parts of
several nearby communities _ about 20,000 residents _ were without
electricity Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only once in every five years would we see an equipment
failure that would be this significant,'' said Deborah Beauchamp, a
spokeswoman for Connecticut Light and Power.
</P>
<P>
   In the Washington Heights section of Manhattan, about 15,000
homes were without power.
</P>
<P>
   At dusk, at several intersections in Washington Heights, teams
of officers were deployed with riot gear, night sticks and helmets.
</P>
<P>
   Here and there, tempers were fraying as the heat combined with
the effects of prolonged local blackouts. On Hillside Avenue, a
quiet residential street beneath one of the steep rock ridges
splitting the area, manholes popped at 11 p.m. Monday as short
circuits blew out power to several buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Two young women sat on a stoop, staring at a new Goldstar
air-conditioner still in its box. Lourdes Espinal, a 28-year-old
purchasing manager in Manhattan, laughed as she recalled how she
spent her lunch hour Tuesday hunting all over for an
air-conditioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't use it,'' she said ruefully. No electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The power failure forced sections of the subway to be closed.
Late Tuesday morning, the 1/9 train was closed from 168th Street to
242nd Street, and the A train was closed from 168th Street to 207th
Street.

MEDIA HIRING OF MINORITIES NOT MATCHING MAKEUP OF U.S., FORUM
TOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It was billed as a town hall meeting open to the
public, but some of the most poignant moments at a forum Tuesday on
minority representation in the media occurred before the
question-and-answer session ever got started.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: Dolores Sibonga, columnist for the Filipino
American Herald, told the audience about her days as a journalism
student in the 1950s, when there were three students of color in
her class.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our radio/television professor sat down with us one day and
said, `You know, we weren't sure whether we were going to let you
graduate, because we weren't sure if you could get jobs.'''
</P>
<P>
   Case in point No. 2: Newsweek contributor and columnist Ellis
Cose told how he was going through the memos of his predecessor
after he joined the New York Daily News many years ago as head of
the newspaper's editorial pages. One of the memos, Cose said, was
``an edict'' declaring that the paper could run no more than one
black columnist per day.
</P>
<P>
   ``What that illustrated to me,'' Cose said, ``was that he had in
his head an idea of how much diversity was enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Up and down the panel of six minority journalists, the stories
were strikingly similar, making for a kick-in-the-consciousness
launch to UNITY '99, the largest gathering of journalists in the
country. UNITY is an alliance of four organizations representing
minority journalists, and this week's meeting of an estimated 6,000
participants in Seattle is the second such cooperative convention
whose aim is to improve minority representation in the media.
</P>
<P>
   Catalina Camia, president of UNITY and a Washington, D.C.,
reporter for the Dallas Morning News, said editors have pledged for
years that they value diversity in their hiring and their news
content.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as America becomes more ethnically and racially diverse,''
she said, ``the media have been slow to keep pace with this dynamic
change. Most of the people who cover the news and make the decision
about what gets covered are still overwhelmingly white and male,
and the reality is that as America becomes more diverse, many
people of color believe they are being excluded from the front
pages and evening news. That is a disturbing fact for this
industry, which must discover a way to address this disparity or
lose credibility with the communities they serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Camia's concern is supported by industry figures that show
hiring of minorities in newsrooms across the United States has
leveled off after enjoying a growth spurt in the early '90s. While
the Census Bureau says people of color now make up 28 percent of
the general U.S. population, they account for only 11.5 percent of
newsroom employees at daily newspapers and 19 percent at commercial
television stations. These figures, provided by the American
Society of Newspaper Editors and the Radio &AMP; Television News
Directors Association, have not changed markedly in the past five
years, despite efforts by both organizations to encourage minority
hiring.
</P>
<P>
   ASNE, in fact, created a goal more than 20 years ago to reach
minority-representation ``parity'' in the newspaper industry by the
year 2000. It has since pushed back the target date to 2025 ``or
sooner,'' if possible. For nearly three decades, meanwhile,
broadcasters were under Federal Communications Commission rules to
diversify their newsrooms or risk losing their licenses. That 1969
rule has since been ruled unconstitutional but RTNDA president
Barbara Cochran says radio and TV stations remain committed to
diversity.
</P>
<P>
   The slow progress toward matching the minority makeup of the
nation now has some newspaper editors thinking about ASNE's goal of
diversifying newsrooms not as a matter of hiring but as a matter of
journalistic accuracy. David Yarnold, executive editor of the San
Jose Mercury News, said that if a paper doesn't truly reflect its
community, is it really being accurate in its coverage?
</P>
<P>
   By phrasing the issue this way, Yarnold said, ``we think we've
hit a nerve _ (using) diversity as a core journalism value, a
dimension of accuracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some of the panelists were skeptical of ASNE's goal.
</P>
<P>
   Cose said journalism institutions must undergo a ``huge and
fundamental change'' in how they operate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not so much call it a matter of accuracy as a matter
of comprehensiveness,'' he said. ``What needs to happen is that
communities of color need to be treated the same way that white,
upper-middle-class communities are treated.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Sibonga added: ``I don't think things will change until
ownership changes.''

END NOT A RELIEF FOR RED SOX?
</HEADLINE>
 BBA-REDSOX-DEVILRAYS-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By MARK BLAUDSCHUN 
c.1999 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Different script, slightly different
story. But when it comes to playing the Devil Rays, it was the same
old frustrating ending for the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay may look like normal lower-echelon fodder to most
folks, considering that the Devil Rays are 12 games below .500 and
mired in fourth place in the AL East.
</P>
<P>
   But to the Red Sox, who are 4-7 against Tampa Bay this season,
Tuesday night's 6-4 loss was just plain aggravating.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're tough,'' sighed Red Sox manager Jimy Williams after
watching a 4-3 lead turn into a loss when reliever John Wasdin
threw a less-than-great fastball to Paul Sorrento, and the ball
landed just beyond the grasp of Damon Buford, who tried to pull the
ball back into play over the center-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   But as has been the case most of the season against the Devil
Rays, who clinched the season series with the victory, it wasn't
quite enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had a lot of close games with them,'' said Williams. ``They're
a good team.''
</P>
<P>
   Against the Red Sox, they're better than good. The Devils Rays
may be going nowhere but home come the first week of October, but
you couldn't tell that to the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night was frustrating because the Red Sox came so close
again as they grinded through another game minus some key players,
wasting some good efforts, and coming up a little short.
</P>
<P>
   For example:
</P>
<P>
   They again played without All-Star starting shortstop Nomar
Garciaparra, who is bothered by a pulled left groin that has kept
him out of four straight games.
</P>
<P>
   They wasted a good performance from rookie pitcher Jin Ho Cho,
who worked a solid five innings before departing after throwing 81
pitches and holding a one-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   And they wasted another clutch hit by first baseman Mike
Stanley, who ripped a three-run homer, his 11th, into the
right-field seats in the third for a 4-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But essentially, the game came down to one pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays had nipped at Cho's pitches for five innings and
had closed to within 4-3 when Williams went to his bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   First up was Pat Rapp, who went two strong innings before a
one-out walk to Wade Boggs in the eighth brought Williams out of
the dugout and Wasdin into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Wasdin knew what to expect; he was the designated setup guy for
the night. ``Derek Lowe pitched (Monday night),'' said Wasdin. ``So
I knew there was a pretty good chance I would get in the game
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   So in he came. With one out and the tying run on first, Wasdin
allowed a bloop single to shortstop Aaron Ledesma, putting runners
on first and second and bringing up Sorrento, a New Englander who
seems to find a way to beat the Red Sox with his bat at least once
a year.
</P>
<P>
   Wasdin threw a couple of setup pitches and then went to his
fastball, which he wanted to throw high and tight, but instead came
in low and away into Sorrento's power area, and he cracked his
second homer in less than a week off Wasdin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played well,'' said Wasdin. ``My job was to come in and
shut them down. It didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, I was just trying to make solid contact,'' said
Sorrento, a Peabody native. ``It had been a long night before that
(0 for 3). He just happpened to put a pitch over the plate, a
fastball, and it just hit the good part of the bat.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom of the eighth was typical of what has happened to the
Red Sox against the Devil Rays this season.
</P>
<P>
   So was the entire game. The Red Sox pounded starter Wilson
Alvarez for seven hits in the first three innings, highlighted by
Stanley's blast.
</P>
<P>
   Cho, coming off a horrendous effort a week ago against Tampa in
which he was rocked for eight hits and four runs in 3 2/3 innings,
turned in a solid effort.
</P>
<P>
   But the Devil Rays picked up two runs in the fourth on a two-out
double by catcher Mike DiFelice and another in the fifth on an RBI
groundout by Jose Canseco.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, the Red Sox did enough things right and hung on
for a 4-2 win. Tuesday night, it turned out the wrong way again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't get enough runs,'' said Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Not enough runs, not enough hits. Not enough good pitches at the
right time.
</P>
<P>
   But with Pedro Martinez going Wednesday night, it would appear
that the Red Sox are ready to right their ship.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, you never know with the Devil Rays.

<P>
   Bob Backus, who used weight training to help overcome serious
illness and became the world's best weight thrower, died on June 30
at Vencor Hospital in Boston. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   Backus had been in poor health for several years and had
suffered a stroke last December, his lawyer, J. Marlin Hawthorne,
said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, Backus, at 6 feet 5 inches and 160 pounds, took up
weight lifting to help recover from spinal meningitis. During World
War II, he was so thin that the Army Air Forces dropped him from
its cadet program. In those days, most athletes feared that lifting
weights to gain strength would make them muscle bound. Backus
disagreed and built himself into a 290-pound strongman.
</P>
<P>
   At Tufts University, he started a lifelong dedication to weight
throwing. The track and field musclemen who threw the 16-pound
hammer outdoors often threw the 35-pound weight indoors and the
56-pound weight (no longer used) outdoors. The weights were iron
balls connected by short steel links to a rigid triangular handle.
</P>
<P>
   Backus set career bests of 45 feet 2 inches in 1957 for the
56-pound weight and 66-2 3/4 in 1959 for the 35-pound weight. Both
performances were American records, in effect world records because
the weight throws were contested mainly in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, the throwing circle had no warning rim, just a
painted line, and there were no shoes for throwers. Backus solved
that problem by wearing ballet slippers.
</P>
<P>
   He won seven consecutive American titles in the 56-pound weight
throw (1953-59), seven in eight years in the 35-pound weight throw
(1954-61) and one (1954) in the hammer throw. He won a gold in the
hammer throw in the 1955 Pan American Games and in 1982 was voted
the best indoor weight thrower ever.
</P>
<P>
   In his prime, he competed almost weekly in New York and Boston
against Al Hall, Stewart Thomson and Tom Pagani, his New York
Athletic Club teammates, and sometimes against Harold Connolly, the
1956 Olympic hammer-throw champion. During the winter, because the
weights would have destroyed arena floors, the competition was in
cold armories, such as the Squadron A Armory on the East Side of
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Before dawn, the athletes would load their families into cars
and drive 200 or 300 miles to compete. Sometimes, they persuaded
officials to hold one meet right after another so they could
compete twice.
</P>
<P>
   Joe McCluskey was then the New York AC coach. ``Bob Backus loved
to compete,'' the 88-year-old McCluskey recalled Tuesday. ``They
would compete so hard among themselves, and then they would go out
with their families together.''
</P>
<P>
   Backus lived in Pembroke, Mass., and for years owned a gymnasium
there. He was a fitness consultant whose clients included the
Yankees during 1983 spring training.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1952 Helsinki Olympics, he finished 13th in the hammer
throw. While there, he met Elsa Torikka of Finland, who placed 17th
in the women's javelin. They were married in 1957 and later
divorced. He is survived by his former wife and a daughter, Lisa,
of Skaneateles, N.Y., and a son, Niles, of Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
   Until his health declined, Backus remained active. At 51, he
finished second in the 35-pound weight throw in the national indoor
championships. He was amused at the fuss.
</P>
<P>
   ``People overdo this age thing,'' he said, ``but I guess you
could say this was a victory for the Geritol set.''

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, July 7:
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has been exploring ways to bring a
lawsuit against the tobacco industry to recoup the billions of
dollars spent treating smoking-related illnesses under Medicare and
other federal medical programs. Forty-six states reached a $206
billion settlement with tobacco companies last year to recover
state Medicaid costs connected to smoking. A successful federal
suit could bring in new revenues that would shore up the Medicare
trust fund and help reduce smoking by raising cigarette prices.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the Senate Appropriations Committee refused in
its spending bill for the Commerce, Justice and State departments
to finance the administration's $20 million request to proceed with
the suit. Worse, the committee's report contains ambiguous language
that might be read to prohibit the Justice Department from pursuing
the litigation at all. The report expressly says that no funds are
provided for expert witnesses in any tobacco lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., and Bob Graham, D-Fla., both
strong proponents of tobacco control, are expected to offer an
amendment on the Senate floor to make clear that nothing in the
appropriations bill prevents the tobacco lawsuit. If the vague
language in the committee report is used to stop the administration
from pressing legitimate claims, that would amount to giving the
tobacco industry immunity from the federal suit. It would also set
a dangerous precedent in other cases where lawmakers might be
tempted to run interference for companies or industries that are
faced with government litigation.

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, July 7:
</P>
<P>
   After a timely intervention by President Clinton over the
weekend, Pakistan may be ready to bring about the withdrawal of
hundreds of armed Islamic militants fighting Indian soldiers in the
mountains of Kashmir. The pledge to take ``concrete steps'' on the
border with India, including the withdrawal of the militants from
Indian territory, was made by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif after a
hastily scheduled meeting with Clinton in Washington. It was a
welcome promise that could defuse tensions. But Sharif could have
difficulty executing it. In the face of continued fighting in the
mountains, he must persuade the army and supporters of the
militants in Pakistan that it is the right course.
</P>
<P>
   Since independence and partition in 1947, India and Pakistan
have fought two wars over Kashmir, a coveted region of lakes, lush
valleys and snowy mountains. The Kashmiris themselves seem to want
outright independence. A guerrilla uprising has raged for most of
the last decade, killing thousands as Indian troops have been sent
in to put it down. But Pakistan badly miscalculated if it was
hoping to draw the world's attention to Kashmir by sending in
several hundred guerrilla fighters this spring. India has been
right to demand withdrawal of the militants before any further
negotiations on Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   For most of its history, Pakistan has been ruled by military
dictatorships, and the Kashmir operation may have been carried out
by elements of the army. If that is the case, their motive may well
have been to humiliate or undercut Sharif, who took the bold step
of inviting the Indian prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, to
Lahore earlier this year for a meeting to reduce mutual tensions.
The fear in Pakistan now is that if the insurgents in Kashmir are
forced to withdraw, they and their allies could train their sights
on Sharif's government, throwing Pakistan into turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif needs to persuade the Islamic militants and their
supporters that the infiltration has backfired, alienating
traditional Pakistani allies like China and drowning out Pakistan's
demands for a mediated settlement. Sharif can also claim to have
achieved progress in Pakistan's drive to draw the United States in
as a mediator. After meeting with Sharif, Clinton promised to take
a renewed ``personal interest'' in intensifying talks between these
two rival nations.
</P>
<P>
   India has responded with firmness and restraint to the recent
threat, though it has lost several hundred lives while trying to
dislodge the militants from their mountain redoubts. Now India can
make a withdrawal easier by not firing on militants if they leave
and by pledging to reopen talks on Kashmir and other issues.
Kashmir is a seemingly intractable dispute of religion, ethnicity
and borders. But as the world learned in Kosovo, these disputes can
spin out of control. India and Pakistan, now armed with nuclear
weapons, have no choice but to resolve their disagreements
peacefully.

LABOR DEPARTMENT ACCUSES BOEING OF WITHHOLDING RECORDS IN BIAS
CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL NYHAN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The U.S. Labor Department accused The Boeing Co. of
interfering with its investigation of discrimination at the
aerospace giant in three lawsuits filed Tuesday, opening another
chapter in the company's effort to settle charges of racial bias.
</P>
<P>
   Federal lawyers charged that Boeing denied investigators access
to records and facilities tied to allegations of racial
discrimination by Paul Coston, a Boeing employee. Coston is also
involved in a proposed $15 million settlement of racial
discrimination charges at Boeing, although he objects to the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department, however, is investigating charges of bias
in a different arena. Under federal law, the agency is permitted to
look into allegations of discrimination at any company that secures
federal contracts. Boeing, the second-largest U.S. defense
contractor, earned $11 billion in federal work in the last fiscal
year, the department said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denying us that access cannot _ and will not _ be tolerated,''
said Labor Secretary Alexis Herman in a prepared statement after
the suits were filed at the Labor Department's Office of
Administrative Law Judges.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing attempted to resolve charges of racial bias on Jan. 22,
when it announced it was settling two class-action lawsuits brought
by a group of African American employees who charged they were
discriminated against at the aerospace giant.
</P>
<P>
   The suits complained of a racially hostile work environment in
which blacks were the object of slurs, crude drawings and
intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's action includes two other suits in which the Labor
Department charged Boeing with interfering in compliance reviews in
Mesa, Ariz., and Wichita, Kan. In all three cases brought Tuesday,
the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, a division of
the Labor Department, was denied access to records, according to
the lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing officials claim the Labor Department is seeking an
unreasonable amount of information that goes beyond Coston's
original claims, according to Peter Conte, a spokesman for the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing argued that if the courts eventually approve the
settlement, brokered in January with the help of civil rights
leader Jesse Jackson, Coston's claims will be addressed, according
to Conte. In that case the Labor Department lacks the authority to
continue reviewing Coston's charges, Conte said.
</P>
<P>
   Coston was unavailable last night for comment on the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The violations, if proven, could carry hefty penalties. The
government can cancel contracts or bar a company from future
federal work. However, both sides said they were hopeful they could
settle the issues without imposing sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing officials added that they would like to resolve the
matter ``informally'' and are talking with federal officials about
the cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what gives us a reasonable belief that we can work
through these issues,'' Conte said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Boeing has never lost a contract because of an
assessment that it failed to comply with federal equal opportunity
and affirmative action laws, Conte said.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear what effect the lawsuits will have on the separate
proposal to settle discrimination charges at Boeing. The plan,
brokered by Jackson, is pending in U.S. District Court.
</P>
<P>
   In May, U.S. District Court Judge John Coughenour granted
opponents of the pact four months to investigate allegations that
it doesn't go far enough. Coston is one of the employees who
objects, according to lawyers working on the case.
</P>
<P>
   The federal judge has scheduled another hearing for Sept. 23,
after lawyers depose a handful of witnesses, which could include
Boeing's chairman and chief executive officer, Phil Condit.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to $15 million in payments, Boeing promised in the
settlement to improve the way it selects and promotes workers,
promised to adopt a new system for handling complaints about
discrimination, harassment or retaliation and hire a consultant to
assess how well the changes work.
</P>
<P>
   Some employees, led by Philadelphia-based lawyer Alan Epstein of
Jablon Epstein, said the proposal didn't go far enough, charging it
lacked the teeth to enforce the changes. They also questioned
whether the monetary award was large enough, according to Mary
Roberts, another lead lawyer in the case, representing Frank Rosen
Freed Garfinkel &AMP; Roberts based in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The initial suit was brought by 43 black workers who said
discrimination was common at Boeing plants in the Puget Sound area.
</P>
<P>
   Later, black workers for Boeing in Philadelphia and Wichita
joined the suit. A second suit also was started. Nearly 13,000
blacks worked for Boeing around the country as of January. The
total work force is currently about 214,000.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed settlement, 20,000 current and former
employees of Boeing and its subsidiary companies would be eligible
to share in $7.3 million in payments.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing also agreed to spend $3.65 million on improved training
and changes in the way it selects managers and makes other
promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing must also pay $750,000 over three years to finance the
monitoring of the settlement, according to lawyers for the
plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the 35-page document, Boeing denied it ever
engaged in any pattern of racial discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Boeing is facing 10 open compliance reviews and three
complaint investigations, according to Conte.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Eighteen months after a state workplace-smoking
ban took effect, Los Angeles launches its enforcement program
Wednesday with two full-time city smoking inspectors for more than
3,000 bars and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've got the teeth to the ordinance now, and we've
got staffing to follow up on the complaints whereas before we had
the ordinance without an enforcement mechanism,'' said Fire Chief
William Bamattre.
</P>
<P>
   The state ban on smoking in public bars, restaurants and other
eateries took effect in January 1998. But the city lagged in
cracking down on violations, with no formal enforcement program.
</P>
<P>
   Fire officials cannot say how many citations the department has
issued.
</P>
<P>
   After months of planning, two fire inspectors were assigned to
investigate complaints of smoking in public bars and eateries, and
to issue citations to owners, employees and patrons who break the
ban.
</P>
<P>
   Fines start at $81 and can run up to $500.
</P>
<P>
   ``A quite overdue effective enforcement program is being put in
place,'' said Councilwoman Laura Chick, who chairs the City
Council's Public Safety Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had this state law in effect for a year and a half.
Better late than never, but this should have been running sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's new inspectors made a trial run in search of smoking
ban violations Thursday, fire officials said, but issued no
citations. They will begin the program in full force today.
</P>
<P>
   The program, with two inspectors and a clerk, costs $250,000 a
year and is paid out of the city's general fund. The city has
sought additional money from the county and from national tobacco
settlements to educate the public about the smoking ban, but those
funds remain uncertain, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The enforcement system begins with a letter notifying restaurant
and bar owners of the enforcement program, according to a Fire
Department report released Tuesday. Businesses then must post signs
bearing a toll-free number that patrons or employees can call to
report violations.
</P>
<P>
   After the first such complaint, the establishment gets a notice
of violation. After the second complaint, it gets a visit from Fire
Department inspectors within three days.
</P>
<P>
   If inspectors catch someone smoking, they will notify City
Attorney James Hahn, whose office will decide whether to file
criminal charges against an owner or employee.
</P>
<P>
   Penalties for businesses range from $100 for a first offense to
$500 for a third offense, and could escalate up to $7,000 if the
problem is serious enough for Cal-OSHA _ the state Occupational
Safety and Health Administration _ to get involved, said fire
Captain Mark Gozawa.
</P>
<P>
   Fines against patrons range from $81 to $324, depending on
whether it's a first offense or a repeat offense.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year and a half, the City Attorney's Office has
issued 325 letters of violation, and referred 106 cases to the Fire
Department, said City Attorney's Office spokesman Mike Qualls.
</P>
<P>
   Fire officials said they do not know how many of those cases led
to citations, but one of those cases went to prosecution, Qualls
said.
</P>
<P>
   Among those welcoming the new enforcement efforts is Brian
Wilke, 36, a nonsmoker from suburban Van Nuys. Wilke said he was
glad no one was smoking in the Robin Hood British Pub in Van Nuys
while he was eating a cheeseburger and having a pint of beer.
</P>
<P>
   But he was more interested in the fire inspectors' efforts
because he believed it would be fairer for those bars and
restaurants that abide by the law and lose business to neighboring
establishments that let patrons smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just have one place doing it and another not doing
it,'' Wilke said. ``There has to be consistency among everybody for
it to be a fair law.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the San Fernando Valley, some barkeepers would
rather risk a fine and permit smoking than lose business.
</P>
<P>
   At a small bar in Sherman Oaks, three of the eight customers
were openly smoking Tuesday afternoon with no objection from the
bartender.
</P>
<P>
   The bartender, who asked that the business not be identified out
of fear of being targeted by inspectors, said the bar had banned
customers from smoking for a few months after the law passed. But a
steady decline in business and little evidence of enforcement
forced it to gradually rescinded the ban, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had four notices of our first warning,'' said the
bartender, who said he figured the anti-smoking crackdown in Los
Angeles was inevitable after officials in San Diego launched a
similar effort.
</P>
<P>
   At most, he said he reminds customers that it is illegal to
smoke in the bar and he refers to ashtrays as ``candy dishes.''
</P>
<P>
   He believes it is inevitable that he will be inspected and fined
for allowing smoking, but has seen no reason yet to restrict
patrons' desire to smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to happen. They're going to come in here and I'm
going to get fined and the customers are going to get fined,'' he
said. ``But what can you do? Look over your shoulder all the
time?''
</P>
<P>
   A patron of the bar, Tom Millican, 65, a retired accountant from
Sherman Oaks, said the mere threat of a fine was not enough to get
him to snuff out his Marlboro. Instead, he would wait to see how
strict the inspectors would be in coming months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see if they enforce it,'' he said.

REGULATIONS HAVE HOME HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN A TAILSPIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; tx:WASHINGTON _ Until she reached 92, Mildred Bengston
maintained her independence.
</P>
<P>
   She lived alone in the same Kansas City, Kan., neighborhood she
had called home for 40 years. And with her daughter and
grandchildren nearby, help was always at hand. But in spring 1996,
she became bedridden with assorted ailments.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's home health-care system, which through Medicare has
helped many elderly patients stay out of costly hospitals and
nursing homes, stepped in to help. A nurse treated Bengston at home
three times a week.
</P>
<P>
   But the system now is in a tailspin, rocked by financial and
regulatory restrictions. For millions of in-home patients
throughout the country, the outlook is unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   The home health-care industry and its advocates say more
patients are losing services and more are forced to seek expensive
treatment elsewhere, while some _ the number is not known _ are
disappearing through the cracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is safe to assume we really don't know where these patients
are or how their health status has been affected,'' Barbara Markham
Smith, a health-policy analyst, told a Senate hearing on home
health care last month.
</P>
<P>
   Health care has become a front-burner political issue as the
2000 elections approach. President Clinton has proposed that
Medicare recipients receive prescription drug coverage, and
Congress is wrestling with HMO reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Home health care arose as an issue last week as Sens. Kit Bond
of Missouri and Susan Collins of Maine, both Republicans, offered
legislation to ease some of the restrictions Congress placed on the
industry two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters estimate that about 2,000 home health-care agencies
have shut down since Congress passed the Balanced Budget Act of
1997, which contained new controls and cutbacks in Medicare
spending.
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri, nearly a third of the more than 300 home
health-care agencies closed, including the Visiting Nurse
Association of St. Louis. In Kansas, the toll has been 47 agencies
out of more than 200 _ including Bengston's original provider.
</P>
<P>
   She now is being cared for by another agency, but sees a nurse
only once a week. Her daughter, 68-year-old Woodyne Mann, retired
from teaching elementary school to stay home and care for her. It
was either that or send her to a nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made up my mind that I would keep her here in my home,''
Mann said.
</P>
<P>
   The full impact of the reforms, however, appears to have been
unanticipated. The goal was to make the program more efficient, and
the Congressional Budget Office originally concluded that the
changes would cut Medicare home health expenses by $16 billion over
five years. That estimate has swollen to nearly $50 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the federal Health Care Financing Administration,
which oversees Medicare, argue that the impact has not been as
serious as the industry and its advocates portray.
</P>
<P>
   The reforms have ``helped control what was widespread fraud,
waste and abuse, and put us in a position to better protect
vulnerable beneficiaries and improve the quality of home health
care,'' Kathleen Buto, a Health Care Financing Administration
executive, told the Senate at the June hearing. ``We, to date, do
not have objective evidence that...access to care has been
compromised.''
</P>
<P>
   A General Accounting Office report in May stated that the same
number of home health agencies operating in 1996 _ more than 9,000
_ were operating as of Jan. 1 of this year. Even as agencies were
closing in a handful of states, more were opening, the report
stated. The closings occurred largely in urban areas where patients
still had many choices.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith, the analyst involved in a study of the Medicare
changes on home health care, said the zeal to ferret out fraud has
affected both the ``fraudulent provider and the honest provider.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The result is, in the name of controlling fraud, they are
imposing a payment system that will have a very serious effect on
the ability of the sickest to get care, because it...links high
cost with fraud, when that is, in fact, a false linkage,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bond and Collins agreed. Their bill, which has bipartisan
support, would eliminate a 15 percent across-the-board cut in
federal home health-care payments scheduled for Oct. 1, 2000. Bond,
Missouri's former chief executive, called the provision ``similar
to a last-minute pardon from the governor. I fear this cut would
truly be the death knell for the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 reforms created an Interim Payment System that changed
federal home health reimbursement practices. Instead of paying
agencies according to the cost of their services, they get a
predetermined limit per patient. But that limit is based on what
they received in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   By October 2000, the system will reimburse home health-care
agencies according to a uniform code of treatment costs.
</P>
<P>
   But the fallout from the interim system severely hit patients
who need long-term care, because they are more expensive. Many
agencies are operating under government-imposed caps of around
$3,000 annually per patient. That's less than it can cost to see a
long-term patient just once a week for a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Interim Payment System was devastating the system, to say
the least,'' said Mary Schantz, executive director of the Missouri
Alliance for Home Health Care. ``It had a chilling effect on an
agency's ability to accept higher-cost patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the fraud and abuse that regulators and members of
Congress said was so rampant has been called into question. The
National Association of Home Care, the industry's trade group,
noted that federal investigators backed off somewhat on their
original claim that 40 percent of the home health services paid by
Medicare should not have been covered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear all these wild stories about fraudulent (operators)
caught going off to vacation in the Bahamas,'' said Linda Lubensky,
executive director of the Kansas Home Care Association. ``That's
not the case in Kansas. These are small businesses just making
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Lubensky said any extra funds get invested in equipment upgrades
or are used for indigent people who otherwise would not have access
to home care.
</P>
<P>
   Eileen Van Tasell, who operated agencies in Overland Park and
Kansas City, North, was the original provider for Bengston. She
said the new rules have made it nearly impossible to keep clients
like Bengston who require more complex medical services or
increased attention. Van Tasell is a nurse who has been in the
health-care business for 31 years, but she sold her 7-year-old
business in May to John Knox Village because of the new
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   She once had to turn down aid for an elderly woman who was blind
and diabetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her blindness and diabetes were not going to go away,'' said
Van Tasell, who now operates a private-duty nursing service. ``I
was in an ethical dilemma. What Medicare doesn't pay me, I have to
pay for. Do I put my family and my company at the risk of
bankruptcy, or do I become financially responsible for someone I've
never seen before?''

ASHCROFT LEADS CARNAHAN BY NEARLY $1 MILLION IN FUND-RAISING
DOLLARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sen. John Ashcroft has jumped to an early fund-raising lead in
his bid to retain his seat by collecting nearly $1 million more
than Democrat Mel Carnahan.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft, a Missouri Republican, reported Tuesday that from the
time his campaign began through June 30, he has raised $3 million.
Carnahan, the incumbent two-term governor, said he had taken in
$2.1 million since his campaign began in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft had been running for president until early this year,
when he switched to running for Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans praised Ashcroft's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are astonishing results, especially with Mel Carnahan
using every bit of his power and leverage as governor to pull in
every possible dollar,'' Missouri GOP Chairwoman Ann Wagner said.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan spokesman Roy Temple countered that the Democrat would
have enough to get his message out. He compared Carnahan's fund
raising to that of fellow Democrat Charles Schumer of New York, the
congressman who defeated GOP Sen. Alfonse D'Amato in 1998. Schumer
had raised about $2.2 million at this point in the last election
cycle, Temple said.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Nixon, the Democrat who lost to Sen. Kit Bond last year, had
raised less than $500,000 at the same point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody always anticipated that as an incumbent U.S.
senator, Ashcroft would be able to raise more than the Carnahan
campaign,'' Temple said.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft said that in the first six months of the year he raised
$2.2 million, compared with Carnahan's $1.4 million for the same
period.
</P>
<P>
   Neither campaign has released its cash-on-hand totals, the
figure that indicates how much money each candidate has in the bank
after paying expenses.

AS TALK TURNS TOWARD 2000, GOP NO LONGER SEES DENNIS MOORE AS A
FLUKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They called Dennis Moore a fluke.
</P>
<P>
   A Democratic congressman from Republican-rich Johnson County? A
duck in the Sahara?
</P>
<P>
   But as the talk turns toward 2000 and Moore's re-election bid,
even Republicans are acknowledging that the first Democrat to win
the 3rd District in four decades will be tough to oust.
</P>
<P>
   The rationale for that belief:
</P>
<P>
   - Unlike his predecessor, Republican Vince Snowbarger of Olathe,
the freshman has proved to be an aggressive fund-raiser. Next week,
Moore will report that he has $300,000 in his campaign account. At
the same time in his first term, Snowbarger had $9,600 on hand and
$26,000 in debts.
</P>
<P>
   - A slow-moving Congress has yet to force Moore to take many
stands on prominent issues, though Moore recently voted against a
bill that sought to make it illegal to burn the American flag. The
congressman deemed the decision his most risky vote so far.
</P>
<P>
   - GOP candidates are slow getting out of the gate. In fact, more
Republicans are opting out of the 3rd District race than are
jumping in.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, at least to the Cook Political Report, a
Washington political newsletter, is that the district ``leans''
toward re-electing Moore.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the rating comes early in the election cycle, and a
lot can change. Republicans insist, for example, that their nominee
will get a big boost from the large number of voters who will want
to vote for president. In the 3rd District, most of those voters
will be Republicans, and many will be inclined to back the GOP
candidate for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the odds of beating Dennis are greater than 50-50 but
are by no means certain,'' said Kansas GOP Chairman Mark Parkinson.
</P>
<P>
   As in 1998, the race for the 3rd District, which covers Johnson,
Wyandotte, Miami and parts of Douglas counties, will be one of the
premier contests in the country. Republicans, who hold only a
12-seat edge over the Democrats in the House, view this seat as
prime GOP territory and will provide ``virtually unlimited
support'' to their nominee, Parkinson said. Democrats are likely to
do the same.
</P>
<P>
   With the stakes so high, potential GOP challengers have been
sizing up their chances since shortly after the 1998 election.
Consultants have been interviewed, an in-depth poll has been taken,
and GOP leaders have struggled to find a consensus candidate who
can appeal to conservative and moderate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   So far, three likely Republican contenders have emerged: state
Rep. Phill Kline of Shawnee, Overland Park City Councilman Greg
Musil, and Overland Park surgeon Jeff Colyer. However, none has
formally entered the race.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three, Kline, a conservative, is said to be the most
certain to run. The 39-year-old has earned kudos for his
tax-cutting work in the Legislature but was recently dumped as
chairman of the House Appropriations Committee after a dispute with
the House speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's winnable,'' Kline said of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Musil, who would have the backing of the moderate GOP
establishment, said this week that he, too, was leaning toward the
race, although some Republicans have counseled him to stay out.
They would prefer to see Musil run for mayor of Overland Park in
2001, a contest he might be favored to win.
</P>
<P>
   Colyer, a 39-year-old reconstructive surgeon who plies his trade
in some of the world's trouble spots, said he was ``exploring'' the
race. He is regarded as a conservative.
</P>
<P>
   All three acknowledge that knocking off Moore would be tough. At
least one independent observer, University of Kansas political
scientist Allan Cigler, is skeptical about their chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm not seeing the kind of high-profile person where
there's a pretty good consensus that this is the candidate,''
Cigler said.
</P>
<P>
   Others are surprised that so few candidates have stepped
forward. Among those who have considered the race, then backed out,
are GOP national committeeman Dwight Sutherland and former Johnson
County Commissioner David Wysong. State Sen. Nick Jordan of Shawnee
said he was interested but was inclined to run for a state Senate
leadership post.
</P>
<P>
   Snowbarger, the man Moore beat in the hard-fought 1998 race, is
another potential contender. He isn't hinting what he will do,
saying only that he will announce his plans in a few weeks. Other
Republicans, though, said they did not expect him to run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still trying to figure out if it's a race I can win,''
said Snowbarger.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Walter of the Cook Political Report said formidable
Republican challengers had already emerged elsewhere in the country
in suburban districts where Democrats narrowly defeated GOP
incumbents in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Of Kansas' 3rd District, she said: ``I would have thought there
would be a long line of candidates saying this guy (Moore) is in
the wrong district. I don't know where they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Walter said, a candidate could wait until December or
January before jumping in and still make a strong bid.
</P>
<P>
   Moore isn't making himself an easy target. Many Republicans
concede that he hasn't made a huge misstep so far. And they credit
him for remaining highly visible around the district.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's everywhere,'' Wysong said.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern for Republicans remains the intraparty feud
between conservatives and moderates. Some conservatives remain
angry that moderates abandoned Snowbarger for Moore in 1998. They
may be disinclined to back a moderate this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party split is worse than ever,'' Sutherland said.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said his energetic fund-raising showed thathe had learned
from history. Snowbarger's sorry campaign balances at the same
point two years ago placed a huge bull's-eye on Snowbarger's back
and practically invited a strong Democratic challenge. Moore has
often said that if Snowbarger had had $200,000 on hand, the
Democrat would have stayed out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't intend to make the same mistakes that Mr. Snowbarger
made,'' Moore said.

KANSAS LAW FIRM LOOKS OUT FOR ELDERLY AND DISABLED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIUS A. KARASH  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OVERLAND PARK, Kan. _ William G. Hammond got a firsthand look at
the problems of the elderly about five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That's when his mother-in-law broke her hip; suffered a series
of strokes; and moved in with Hammond, his wife and five children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would try to get answers to questions about things like
benefits, insurance, Medicaid,'' he said. ``We would get little
snippets of the answers, but no one seemed to be able to put it all
together. I thought there was a crying need for someone to do it
right.''
</P>
<P>
   The experience prodded Hammond, a lawyer, to found The Elder &AMP;
Disability Law Firm in 1997. The two-lawyer, Overland Park-based
firm focuses on issues such as wills, trusts, probate,
guardianship, estate planning and how to find a nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   The firm has honed in on a growing need _ people 85 and older
make up the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. population.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, elder law is one of the fastest-growing segments
of the legal profession, said Frank Johns, president of the
National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The special needs of these people are significant and highly
complex,'' said Johns, who is based in Greensboro, N.C. ``If you're
going to do a proper service to the people you counsel, you must
have a substantive grasp of 14 areas of law,'' including rules
related to Medicare and other government benefits.
</P>
<P>
   It also takes a grasp of how to deal with people. Hammond said
many of his elderly clients were confused by the intricacies of
Medicare and Medicaid. Their grown children also may feel
frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   Hammond said his firm employed a holistic approach toward
clients and their families. For example, he said his elderly
clients might be under tremendous stress. To put them at ease, he
will spend 30 or 40 minutes discussing family and related topics
before getting down to brass-tacks legal issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``How to find a nursing home is a huge issue,'' he said. ``How
to get good care in a nursing home is another issue _ and how to
pay for it without going broke.''
</P>
<P>
   Another example of Hammond's approach is having a registered
nurse, Mary Helen Gautreaux, on staff. Gautreaux's duties include
participating in care-planning sessions at nursing homes and then
assessing how the nursing home resident is progressing under that
plan.
</P>
<P>
   If a nursing home attempts to discharge a client who still needs
to be there, Hammond and Gautreaux will go together to face the
nursing home officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can be snowed on legal issues and he can be snowed on
clinical issues, but between the two of us they can't snow us,''
Gautreaux said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Gautreaux said, elderly clients are apt to listen
to her advice because she's a registered nurse.
</P>
<P>
   The staff also includes Peggy Tener, a former social worker and
nursing home administrator who maintains her licenses in both
fields.
</P>
<P>
   Gautreaux and Tener serve on an in-house ethics committee of the
Tutera Group, a Kansas City, Mo.-based operator of nursing homes,
assisted-living centers and other retirement facilities around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both very knowledgeable about resident rights and add
a lot to the discussions about ethical dilemmas we face in the
industry,'' said Randy Bloom, Tutera's director of facility
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The law firm works with the Kansas City-based Midwest Bioethics
Center on projects involving long-term care and issues involving
the death of an elderly family member. Don Reynolds, director of
special projects for the center, said he admired the firm's
approach to doing business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like the idea of having the clinical issues and legal
issues and financial issues on the table at the same time,''
Reynolds said. ``We think that's the way you get to decisions that
are informed by ethics.''
</P>
<P>
   Hammond, 44, earned his law degree from Notre Dame University in
1980. He moved to Olathe the same year and worked in financial
planning before founding his firm.
</P>
<P>
   Practicing with Hammond is lawyer Karen H. Weber. Lawyer Robert
W. Loyd is scheduled to join the firm in August.
</P>
<P>
   One of the firm's clients is Dorothy Bernhardt, a 77-year-old
Overland Park resident who contacted the firm last year. Her
husband, Robert Bernhardt, was suffering from Alzheimer's disease
and could no longer live at home. To further complicate matters,
Robert Bernhardt had never made out a will.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like my back was against the wall,'' Dorothy Bernhardt
said. ``I needed an attorney to get some protection so I could go
on living.''
</P>
<P>
   Hammond's firm set up a will for Robert Bernhardt and helped
find a nursing home where he now lives. It also provided help in
other areas, such as possible future nursing home care for Dorothy
Bernhardt and future provisions for a disabled son.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're caring and understanding, the way they do it,'' she
said. ``I know that if I have any problems, I can go to them and
I'm sure they'll help me through it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the way firms in the elder law field are supposed to act,
said Johns, with the National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Infrequently do lawyers look at the quality of life and the
needs of the person,'' Johns said. ``They look at documents and
money. We believe that a holistic view of a client demands that we
look at the quality of life of the client and the quality of
services being delivered to that client.''
</P>
<P>
   And while he may deal with an elderly person's children, Hammond
said his goal was to determine what's best for the parent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elderly people need someone who is committed to dealing with
them during times of great stress, giving them straight answers and
doing it with a gentle spirit,'' he said.

VANGUARD AIRLINES CONSIDERS EXPANSION AT CHICAGO OR KANSAS CITY

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Vanguard Airlines is considering Kansas City
and Chicago as expansion sites as the low-cost carrier adds
airplanes over the next 18 months, a Vanguard executive said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The carrier has also held discussions with two other cities
where the airline may establish another ``minihub'' comparable to
what it already has in Kansas City and Chicago, said Russell
Winter, Vanguard's vice president of marketing and planning. He
declined to identify those cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at a point where we're exploring where the next phase of
growth will be,'' Winter said.
</P>
<P>
   Winter commented Tuesday after a report Monday in Crain's
Chicago Business said Vanguard was talking to aviation officials in
Chicago about expanding its presence at Midway Airport. The article
also suggested that Vanguard might move its corporate headquarters
to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Russell called the Crain article ``premature,'' but he
acknowledged that Vanguard was talking to several cities as it
prepared to add to its fleet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been talking to authorities in Chicago, evaluating the
options there,'' he said. ``But I would say the discussions in
Kansas City are along the same lines as what's happening in
Chicago. Obviously, this is all at an early stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Winter said Vanguard, currently based in Mission, would at least
for the near term maintain its headquarters in the Kansas City
area.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard leases one floor that houses about 40 administrative
employees at its Mission office building, at 7000 Squibb Road. That
lease will expire at the end of August, but the company is holding
talks with the Kansas City Aviation Department about moving to an
office at Kansas City International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard recently renewed its lease for other space in the
Mission building and plans to keep its 120 customer reservations
employees there, Winter said.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard has 23 flights daily at KCI and 19 at Midway. The
discount carrier in recent months has expanded in Chicago, adding
flights to Buffalo, N.Y., and Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Winter said expanding at Midway or KCI presented problems that
Vanguard was trying to address with officials in the two cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more underserved markets we can serve out of
Chicago, but we don't have access to gates there,'' Winter said.
``In Kansas City, we have access to gates, but we have competitive
pressures when it comes to entering new markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Another consideration for Vanguard is hangar space, Winter said.
As Vanguard gets bigger and expands its maintenance operations, the
carrier wants to acquire its own hangar. Part of Vanguard's
discussion with Chicago's aviation officials is about hangar space
at Midway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicago has a hangar,'' Winter said. ``In Kansas City, we
occasionally have gotten access to TWA's facility. However, the
issue there is union labor. We use non-union labor, which is not
allowed at TWA's overhaul base.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicago Aviation Commissioner Mary Rose Loney could not be
reached for comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City aviation and economic development officials said
they were surprised by reports of Vanguard's interest in expanding
at Midway.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the first we heard of it,'' said Phil Brown, Kansas
City's acting aviation director. ``We're working with them right
now on finding space to move their corporate headquarters to the
airport.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said the Aviation Department was trying to establish
office space for Vanguard at KCI's Trans World Technical Academy,
which Vanguard occupies with TWA.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sage, acting president of the Economic Development Corp. of
Kansas City, said his agency was working with Vanguard to relocate
some of its Mission employees to Kansas City. However, Sage said he
was unaware of a potential move of Vanguard's headquarters to
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be flabbergasted if that happened,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard reported its first operating profit in its four-year
history last year. The airline, which has 11 Boeing 737-200s in its
fleet, expects to add bigger planes later this year. Vanguard is
counting on having 13 planes by year-end and 18 aircraft by the end
of 2000.

INTERSTATE BAKERIES IS BUYING CANADIAN BAKING COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Interstate Bakeries Corp. is buying Montreal-based Culinar Inc.,
a Canadian baking company that should add more than $200 million to
Interstate's annual sales of $3.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Culinar makes 100 products, including snack cakes, tarts,
cookies and crackers, which are sold at more than 12,000 locations,
mostly in central and eastern Canada. An estimated one in seven
Canadians buys a Culinar product each day.
</P>
<P>
   Culinar operates five bakeries, including three in the Montreal
area. Unlike Interstate, Culinar does not make bread products.
Interstate Treasurer Paul Yarick said it was not yet known whether
the acquisition would affect any of Culinar's 2,300 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Interstate is the largest wholesale baking company in the United
States. Its brands include well-known names such as Wonder bread
and Twinkie snack cakes. Interstate operates 69 bakeries in the
United States and has 35,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Interstate Chairman Charles Sullivan said that Culinar's
corporate offices would remain in Montreal and that its president,
Gaetan Lussier, would remain at the helm. Terms of the deal were
not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said he saw many cross-selling opportunities for the
companies, including selling Interstate products in Canada and
distributing Culinar products in the United States. Culinar already
distributes Hostess products in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Culinar products are unique,'' Sullivan said. ``They are
different from what we offer elsewhere and, over time, we expect
them to complement our premium snack-cake brands.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, one Culinar product is a chocolate snack cake with
a peanut butter-flavored filling. Interstate has no such product.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first transaction between the companies.
Interstate bought Drake's, a New Jersey baker, from Culinar last
year. Drake's makes such brands as Devil Dogs and Yankee Doodles
snack cakes.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street didn't react much to the news. Interstate's stock,
traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol IBC,
closed Tuesday at 23 9/16, down 5/8.

UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS PROGRAM HELPS MANUFACTURERS SAVE ON ENERGY AND
PRODUCTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A University of Kansas program has helped manufacturers identify
more than $25 million in energy and production savings since it was
founded in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The university's Industrial Assessment Center, part of a
national program sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy, has
helped companies in parts of Kansas, Missouri and Nebraska find the
savings.
</P>
<P>
   The center develops recommendations for small to medium-size
manufacturing plants. It has performed more than 520 audits since
it began in Lawrence nearly 18 years ago, resulting in actual
annual cost savings averaging $20,000 a plant, said Jerry D.
Swearingen, director of the Industrial Assessment Center at KU.
</P>
<P>
   The assessments are provided at no charge to the companies, and
any proprietary information is protected. Also, a company has no
obligations to act on the recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   The Industrial Assessment Center serves manufacturing plants
within 150 miles of the Lawrence campus. The plants must have gross
annual sales of less than $75 million, fewer than 500 employees at
the plant site, annual utility bills of more than $75,000 but less
than $1.75 million, and no in-house professional staff to perform
the assessment.
</P>
<P>
   The center's assessment team visits a plant for a day and issues
a report within 60 days detailing its findings and recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   According to Swearingen, the national assessment program began
in 1976 and KU's program was one of the early teams. There are now
30 participating universities across the country.
</P>
<P>
   KU's assessment team works with companies in the eastern half of
Kansas (including Salina; Manhattan; Kansas City, Kan.; Emporia;
Pittsburg; and Topeka), extreme western Missouri (including Kansas
City, St. Joseph, and Barton and Dade counties north of Joplin),
and the southeast tip of Nebraska (including Lincoln).

TICKETS SELL OUT AS U.S. WOMEN PREPARE FOR SOCCER FINAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(EDITORS: Staff Writer Karen Crouse contributed to this story.)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Soccer fever is sweeping Los Angeles as the World
Cup finals between the United States and China at the Rose Bowl on
Saturday promised to break attendance records for a women's
sporting event.
</P>
<P>
   The 85,000 seats set aside for Saturday's game went quickly.
World Cup organizers offered an additional 3,000 _ which sold out
in three hours. That hasn't stopped scalpers from hawking ducats
for as much as $1,000 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Even President Clinton plans to be at the game, deciding Tuesday
to extend his seven-state trip through the weekend so he can attend
the championship, at the invitation of the U.S. team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, like all Americans, he's been caught up in their
success and wants to be there personally to cheer them on,'' said
White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Seizing on soccermania, Secretary of Health and Human Services
Donna Shalala joined World Cup and youth soccer officials to
encourage girls in Los Angeles to participate in sports and avoid
``at-risk behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   During a break in their practice and workout in Pomona, U.S.
players said they are only now beginning to realize the extent of
their celebrity _ and are elated to be thought of as role models.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so flattering. It makes you want to be a better person
because you see these people are looking up to you,'' said team
member Tisha Venturini.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the best compliments we can receive. I didn't have
any role models when I was growing up,'' team member Shannon
MacMillan chimed in. ``My older brother was my role model. It's all
been unknown for us, so it's great to think for the young girls
growing up there's something tangible for them to hold on to.''
</P>
<P>
   That was no more evident than among hundreds of young fans
gathered at the Pomona workout in search of a glimpse of their
favorite star and perhaps even an autograph.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a Beatles environment out there. Girls have been
screaming like crazy at the games with all the other fans,'' said
Steve Vanderpool, vice president of communications for the 1999
Women's World Cup. ``I think it's a sport that's been brewing for
years, and the fever is finally spreading.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, a day after the U.S. team secured its berth in the
championship match, the 85,000 Rose Bowl seats sold out, but
organizers put 3,000 more on sale. The seats, which are not in
prime locations, were opened up because of customer demand and went
on sale for $45 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more than a championship game now. People want to be
there to wave a flag, paint their face and be a part of history,''
said Richard Finn, a spokesman for the Women's World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always knew that the Rose Bowl had a larger capacity than
what we sold and, even though these seats aren't great, the
customers demanded it.''
</P>
<P>
   Women's World Cup organizers were expecting a record-breaking
85,000 to 90,000 fans to attend the Saturday event. The current
record is 78,972 _ for a World Cup doubleheader at Giants Stadium
in East Rutherford, N.J., on June 19, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Those without tickets can always pay a premium price from ticket
agencies and people looking for a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Gomez is offering his four for $1,000 apiece in a newspaper
classified advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had more than 10 calls for these tickets. The phone has
been going crazy,'' said Gomez, 43, of suburban North Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soccer fever is really out there, but I lost interest in the
finals when Brazil lost,'' said Gomez, a Los Angeles Department of
Water and Power employee. ``I paid $250 each for them, so if worst
comes to worst I will go and take my family.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet was buzzing with World Cup ticket sales on eBay,
Yahoo and Netscape Netcenter, where pairs of tickets ranged between
$165 and $500.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles ticket agencies were cashing in as well, with single
tickets ranging between $150 and $700 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tickets had been on sale since June 1998, but when the U.S.
won on Sunday, the remainder of the final match tickets sold very
quickly,'' said Women's World Cup spokeswoman Gina Davis.
</P>
<P>
   To date, more than 568,000 fans have attended the 30 Women's
World Cup matches across the country, with millions more watching
on television around the globe. The U.S. women _ the 1991 Women's
World Cup champions and 1996 Olympic Games gold medalists _ beat
out Brazil in a 2-0 victory on Independence Day.
</P>
<P>
   They face China, winner of two of the past three games against
the United States and silver medalists in the 1996 Atlanta
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest day is still yet to come,'' said Marla Messing,
president and CEO of the World Cup organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Saturday, the Rose Bowl will be awash with pageantry,
music and thousands of World Cup fans. It will be an occasion to
remember for women's sports.''
</P>
<P>
   The game will be televised nationally on ABC with coverage
beginning at 12:30 p.m. PST. Closing ceremonies will be held
between the third-place match and the final match, featuring a
performance by singer-actress Jennifer Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   Before the final match, Norway will play Brazil in the
third-place game.

LABOR DEPARTMENT ACCUSES BOEING OF WITHHOLDING RECORDS IN BIAS
CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL NYHAN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The U.S. Labor Department accused The Boeing Co. of
interfering with its investigation of discrimination at the
aerospace giant in three lawsuits filed Tuesday, opening another
chapter in the company's effort to settle charges of racial bias.
</P>
<P>
   Federal lawyers charged that Boeing denied investigators access
to records and facilities tied to allegations of racial
discrimination by Paul Coston, a Boeing employee. Coston is also
involved in a proposed $15 million settlement of racial
discrimination charges at Boeing, although he objects to the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department, however, is investigating charges of bias
in a different arena. Under federal law, the agency is permitted to
look into allegations of discrimination at any company that secures
federal contracts. Boeing, the second-largest U.S. defense
contractor, earned $11 billion in federal work in the last fiscal
year, the department said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denying us that access cannot _ and will not _ be tolerated,''
said Labor Secretary Alexis Herman in a prepared statement after
the suits were filed at the Labor Department's Office of
Administrative Law Judges.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing attempted to resolve charges of racial bias on Jan. 22,
when it announced it was settling two class-action lawsuits brought
by a group of African American employees who charged they were
discriminated against at the aerospace giant.
</P>
<P>
   The suits complained of a racially hostile work environment in
which blacks were the object of slurs, crude drawings and
intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's action includes two other suits in which the Labor
Department charged Boeing with interfering in compliance reviews in
Mesa, Ariz., and Wichita, Kan. In all three cases brought Tuesday,
the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, a division of
the Labor Department, was denied access to records, according to
the lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing officials claim the Labor Department is seeking an
unreasonable amount of information that goes beyond Coston's
original claims, according to Peter Conte, a spokesman for the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing argued that if the courts eventually approve the
settlement, brokered in January with the help of civil rights
leader Jesse Jackson, Coston's claims will be addressed, according
to Conte. In that case the Labor Department lacks the authority to
continue reviewing Coston's charges, Conte said.
</P>
<P>
   Coston was unavailable last night for comment on the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The violations, if proven, could carry hefty penalties. The
government can cancel contracts or bar a company from future
federal work. However, both sides said they were hopeful they could
settle the issues without imposing sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing officials added that they would like to resolve the
matter ``informally'' and are talking with federal officials about
the cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what gives us a reasonable belief that we can work
through these issues,'' Conte said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Boeing has never lost a contract because of an
assessment that it failed to comply with federal equal opportunity
and affirmative action laws, Conte said.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear what effect the lawsuits will have on the separate
proposal to settle discrimination charges at Boeing. The plan,
brokered by Jackson, is pending in U.S. District Court.
</P>
<P>
   In May, U.S. District Court Judge John Coughenour granted
opponents of the pact four months to investigate allegations that
it doesn't go far enough. Coston is one of the employees who
objects, according to lawyers working on the case.
</P>
<P>
   The federal judge has scheduled another hearing for Sept. 23,
after lawyers depose a handful of witnesses, which could include
Boeing's chairman and chief executive officer, Phil Condit.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to $15 million in payments, Boeing promised in the
settlement to improve the way it selects and promotes workers,
promised to adopt a new system for handling complaints about
discrimination, harassment or retaliation and hire a consultant to
assess how well the changes work.
</P>
<P>
   Some employees, led by Philadelphia-based lawyer Alan Epstein of
Jablon Epstein, said the proposal didn't go far enough, charging it
lacked the teeth to enforce the changes. They also questioned
whether the monetary award was large enough, according to Mary
Roberts, another lead lawyer in the case, representing Frank Rosen
Freed Garfinkel &AMP; Roberts based in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The initial suit was brought by 43 black workers who said
discrimination was common at Boeing plants in the Puget Sound area.
</P>
<P>
   Later, black workers for Boeing in Philadelphia and Wichita
joined the suit. A second suit also was started. Nearly 13,000
blacks worked for Boeing around the country as of January. The
total work force is currently about 214,000.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed settlement, 20,000 current and former
employees of Boeing and its subsidiary companies would be eligible
to share in $7.3 million in payments.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing also agreed to spend $3.65 million on improved training
and changes in the way it selects managers and makes other
promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing must also pay $750,000 over three years to finance the
monitoring of the settlement, according to lawyers for the
plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the 35-page document, Boeing denied it ever
engaged in any pattern of racial discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Boeing is facing 10 open compliance reviews and three
complaint investigations, according to Conte.

LAST-MINUTE DONATIONS HELP FOREST PRESERVATION FUND REACH GOAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Thanks to major last-minute gifts from technology
millionaires and 5,000 smaller donations from around Washington
state, preservationists have raised enough money to spare from
logging a major wilderness area along the U.S.-Canadian border.
</P>
<P>
   With $1.5 million added to the cause Tuesday, the campaign to
buy logging rights to 25,000 acres of the state-owned Loomis Forest
has raised $13.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have done shows that people in this state care deeply
enough about their forests to give until it hurts,'' said Mitch
Friedman, executive director of the Northwest Ecosystem Alliance, a
Bellingham-based conservation group that spearheaded efforts to
save the forest.
</P>
<P>
   Although it appears to have saved the Loomis Forest from
logging, the campaign hasn't made it entirely out of the woods yet.
</P>
<P>
   The state must complete one final appraisal of the forest before
the state Board of Natural Resources can approve the sale of
logging rights to the remote land.
</P>
<P>
   A previous appraisal pegged the value of timber in the two
segments of land marked for preservation at $13 million to $17
million.
</P>
<P>
   The resources board agreed Tuesday to spend six months
completing the revised appraisal, and to give conservationists
another year _ until July 1 _ to raise more money if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The Loomis Forest Fund was more than $3 million short of its
goal just a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was rescued by a series of last-minute gifts from present and
former executives at Microsoft, RealNetworks and Amazon.com, and
from former King Broadcasting Co. Chairwoman Patricia Bullitt
Collins.
</P>
<P>
   The Loomis Forest is a lofty, out-of-the-way corner of Okanogan
County, just east of the Pasayten Wilderness Area in Washington
state. It adjoins the equally wild Snowy Mountain-Snowy Crater
region of the Similkameen Valley in British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Inhabited by wildlife rarely seen in Washington, it is a
particularly choice domain for such small predators as the Canadian
lynx, the pine marten and fisher. Wolverine tracks were recently
spotted between two high lakes.
</P>
<P>
   The area has a winter moose population, and there have been
occasional grizzly-bear sightings nearby in the Pasayten.
</P>
<P>
   In saving part of the Loomis Forest, conservationists will have
preserved a 75-mile-wide stretch of wild land along the U.S. side
of the border.
</P>
<P>
   The protected areas would begin in rain forests and ridges of
the Mount Baker Wilderness Area east of Bellingham, and stretch to
where slopes of Chopaka Mountain drop 6,700 vertical feet into dry
steppes of the Similkameen Valley in Okanogan County.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign has run into opposition, mainly from cattle and
timber interests in northeast Washington, and school boards in
Okanogan County.
</P>
<P>
   Although timber in the area is mainly small-dimension lodgepole
pine, critics have charged that the Department of Natural Resources
has underestimated its value.
</P>
<P>
   ``This borders on fraud of the people,'' state Sen. Bob Morton,
R-Orient, a critic of selling timber rights to preservationists,
told the Board of Natural Resources Tuesday. Morton claimed to have
information suggesting that the Department of Natural Resources and
state Land Commissioner Jennifer Belcher were withholding the
forest's true value if it is cut down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not withheld information from the board,'' said
Belcher, who has appeared in a video prepared by preservation
advocates.
</P>
<P>
   The 134,000-acre Loomis Forest has already been heavily cut.
Active logging extends as high as 6,000 feet on the south slopes of
Chopaka Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Only a tiny portion of the state forest currently enjoys
protection. The state has created a 2,800-acre natural area around
summit meadows of 7,882-foot Chopaka Mountain and nearby Hurley
Peak.
</P>
<P>
   The wild 25,000 acres marked for preservation come in two
parcels. The larger, the North Fork Conservation Area, adjoins the
Pasayten Wilderness to the east. It is a land of high lodgepole
pine forests, tundralike alpine meadows and rounded summits
reaching to more than 8,000 feet in elevation.
</P>
<P>
   A little more than half the money raised by conservationists
would go, in lieu of timber sales, to the Common School
Construction Trust Fund, which pays to build public schools across
the state.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining money would be used by the state to acquire
alternative timberlands for logging.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's $1.5 million gift that allowed the Loomis Forest Fund
to reach $13.1 million was from an anonymous donor. Fund organizers
still don't know the identity of a $2 million anonymous donor
earlier in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign for the forest has revealed powerful conservation
sentiments by leading figures in the state's technology industries.
Bruce Jacobsen, a former Microsoft and RealNetworks executive, gave
stock valued at about $612,000. The William H. Gates Foundation
gave $250,000. Other gifts have included $400,000 from Jabe
Blumenthal, $160,000 from Floyd and Judy Rogers, and $180,000 from
Bill and Cheryl Pope. Blumenthal, Floyd Rogers and Bill Pope are
former Microsoft executives.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Gardner, the state's former first lady, held one of many
fund-raising parties around the state that collected donations as
small as $10.
</P>
<P>
   If conservationists still need money after the new appraisal,
said Friedman, they will ask the Legislature to provide it.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ As much of the eastern United States sagged Tuesday
under a second day of record high temperatures, officials
attributed at least eight deaths to the heat, and the New York
region struggled with maddening power failures that trapped people
in stifling elevators, cut air-conditioning to thousands of homes
and commercial buildings, and knocked out some subway service.
</P>
<P>
   In some of the New York City's poorest neighborhoods, many
residents huddled in darkness when, just after 10 p.m., power
suddenly failed in the entire area north of 155th Street in
Manhattan, a densely populated area of about three square miles.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Petta, a spokesman for Con Edison, said the power failure
occurred after six of 14 high-voltage cables that supply the area
failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You now have the same amount of electricity traveling across
far fewer lines,'' he said. ``Those lines are designed to carry a
certain amount of electricity, and when they begin to carry far
more, that is what is an overload. What happens is, in effect, like
giant fuses blowing, and then the whole network lost power. It is
very rapid.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday night, Con Edison officials still did not know how
long it would take to restore power to the area. ``I don't recall
in recent memory anything like this happening,'' Petta said.
</P>
<P>
   The Police Department sent hundreds of extra officers into the
blackout area, but early Wednesday morning there were no reports of
looting or disturbances. Fire officials, however, reported several
minor fires in the area. Subway lines through the neighborhood were
also out of service late Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani toured the blackout area Tuesday night.
He praised residents for remaining calm, and criticized Con Edison
for the power failure. ``I find it incredible, after years and
years of blackouts, that enough power can't be supplied to the
city,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ambulance crews in New York City responded Tuesday to more than
170 calls from people complaining of cramps and exhaustion from the
heat, and emergency officials said the heat may have contributed to
a number of heart attacks and at least three deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service reported that the temperature in
Central Park reached 101 degrees at 3:11 p.m. Tuesday, breaking the
record of 98 degrees for the date set in 1986. Temperatures were
expected to moderate this week with a cool front moving through the
region Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Summer school was canceled in Washington on Tuesday, the lights
were dimmed in much of the Massachusetts Statehouse and block
captains checked on the elderly in Philadelphia's row houses.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Giuliani said, ``This is one of the more difficult
days the city has ever had in regard to heat.'' He canceled a
political fund-raising trip to Nantucket in Massachusetts to deal
with the heat emergency.
</P>
<P>
   In the city's first confirmed heat-related death, an autopsy
Tuesday revealed that Julia Johnson, 79, of Manhattan had died of
hyperthermia on Monday, said Ellen Borakove, spokeswoman for the
office of chief medical examiner. Mrs. Johnson was found
unconscious at home by a health care worker.
</P>
<P>
   Her body temperature was 108.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said two other people may have died from the heat. They
were described as a 40-year-old man whose Brooklyn home had a
temperature in excess of 108, and a 27-year-old man who died at
Interfaith Medical Center in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Their names were not released, but neighbors identified the
40-year-old as Samuel Mitchell, a handyman from the Park Slope
section of Brooklyn, who died early Tuesday morning at Brookdale
Hospital Medical Center. Neighbors were told that dehydration was
the cause of death. Herma Passely, 59, who shared a house with
Mitchell, said he never woke up after a back yard Fourth of July
party. ``He said he was tired, went to sleep early and that was
it,'' Mrs. Passely said.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said that while they expected the death toll to
climb, they were confident it would come nowhere near the hundreds
of deaths that Chicago experienced during a brutal heat wave in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``That number might grow a bit, but certainly it will not
approach what happened in the Midwest,'' said Jerome Hauer, the
director of the Mayor's Office of Emergency Management.
</P>
<P>
   The heat wave, combined with record demands for electricity, put
enormous pressure on the power system in the New York region and
elsewhere. Transformers overheated and burst into flames. Power
lines melted through from the heat and high use. In the dense
humidity, bolts of electricity arced across power lines, causing
short circuits.
</P>
<P>
   Utility companies first issued urgent appeals for customers to
conserve energy. Later, to ease the strain on power lines and
transformers and because of insufficient power reserves, the
companies reduced their voltage output by 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, power failures were reported throughout New York City,
Long Island, Westchester County, New Jersey and Connecticut. At
least 150,000 people were affected, officials estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene McGrath, chairman of Con Edison, attributed the power
failures to equipment breakdowns, not the power cutback. ``Those
problems come about from the cables overheating,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani scolded Con Edison officials for not giving city
officials more explicit warnings about the extent of the power
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Con Ed is its own entity unto itself, and sometimes they
notify us late and sometimes they notify us only when the problem
has already started,'' the mayor said. ``I think it's a cause of
great frustration, for me and my administration and every other
mayor that's ever had this job. They call you about 10 minutes
before there is a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   New York City activated its emergency operations center Tuesday,
and Giuliani appealed for residents to avoid strenuous activity and
stay indoors near fans and air-conditioners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember hotter days than the last several and
particularly hotter nights,'' he said at a news conference at City
Hall. ``We would like everyone to be very, very careful.''
</P>
<P>
   On average, city ambulances respond to 3,000 calls a day, but
fire officials said they expected to handle more than 4,000 calls
Tuesday. ``It could be the busiest day in the department's
history,'' one fire official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a great stress on our emergency system,'' Giuliani
said.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent cars from overheating in traffic, city officials shut
down some highway construction. To keep people from overheating,
sprinkler caps were placed on open fire hydrants, extra ambulances
were pressed into service, and cooling centers were opened in
dozens of senior citizen centers and community centers operated by
the New York City Housing Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, officials opened 15 schools across the city where
anyone could sleep in the comfort of air-conditioning, Hauer said.
Cots, food and blankets were supplied by the American Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   He and other city officials credited a heat plan devised in the
aftermath of the Chicago heat wave with averting a similar disaster
in New York City. Still, there were major concerns Tuesday night,
including worries about the low water pressure in some parts of the
city. The low pressure threatened to hamper firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   On a normal day, New York City consumes 1.2 billion gallons of
water. Tuesday, the city consumed about 1.8 billion gallons, much
of that additional use spilling from open fire hydrants, Hauer
said.
</P>
<P>
   The high water consumption left some areas, especially in
Brooklyn, vulnerable to fire. ``There are some areas we are still
concerned about,'' Hauer said, adding that fire officials were
combating the problem by installing more sprinkler heads on
hydrants.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   According to meteorologists, a heat wave of this size and
intensity requires three main ingredients, and all three were
present this week. The first two are clear skies and a large mass
of hot air. But the third ingredient is the most important: a wind
from the west, a wind that comes off the Catskills and the
Appalachian Mountains, compressing and heating as it descends, then
overwhelming the cooling on-shore breeze from the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the type of pattern that generates extreme heat across
the Northeast seaboard,'' said Todd Miner, a meteorologist for
Pennsylvania State University.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Tuesday was another day of unwelcome records, both
for weather observations and for power use. Though Tuesday's high
fell short of New York City's record of 106 in 1936, back-to-back
days of temperatures above 100 degrees are rare. The last time it
happened was in July 1993. On July 9 it was 101; the next day, it
was 102.
</P>
<P>
   Despite pleas to conserve energy, both Con Edison and the Long
Island Power Authority reported record demand for electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Across the city, building managers embarked on ``load shedding''
_ shutting down two elevators in a bank of eight, or turning off
unneeded pumps and exhaust fans. On Long Island, officials
persuaded the Long Island Rail Road to slow the acceleration of its
electric trains, also to save power. But those actions were not
enough.
</P>
<P>
   In Westchester County, 10,000 customers were without power late
Tuesday afternoon. Among the hardest hit were the towns of
Harrison, Rye, Port Chester and New Rochelle. The Westchester
Medical Center in Valhalla was forced to use backup power
generators.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, a spokesman for Public Service Electric and Gas
Co. said about 9,000 commercial and residential customers had no
power Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In the most serious incident, the spokesman said, the Englewood
Hospital was reported to be without power for a period because a
backup power generator failed. Fire officials there knew of no
deaths resulting from the power failure.
</P>
<P>
   And in Connecticut, most of the city of New London and parts of
several nearby communities _ about 20,000 residents _ were without
electricity Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only once in every five years would we see an equipment
failure that would be this significant,'' said Deborah Beauchamp, a
spokeswoman for Connecticut Light and Power.
</P>
<P>
   In the Washington Heights section of Manhattan, about 15,000
homes were without power.
</P>
<P>
   At dusk, at several intersections in Washington Heights, teams
of officers were deployed with riot gear, night sticks and helmets.
</P>
<P>
   Here and there, tempers were fraying as the heat combined with
the effects of prolonged local blackouts. On Hillside Avenue, a
quiet residential street beneath one of the steep rock ridges
splitting the area, manholes popped at 11 p.m. Monday as short
circuits blew out power to several buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Two young women sat on a stoop, staring at a new Goldstar
air-conditioner still in its box. Lourdes Espinal, a 28-year-old
purchasing manager in Manhattan, laughed as she recalled how she
spent her lunch hour Tuesday hunting all over for an
air-conditioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't use it,'' she said ruefully. No electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The power failure forced sections of the subway to be closed.
Late Tuesday morning, the 1/9 train was closed from 168th Street to
242nd Street, and the A train was closed from 168th Street to 207th
Street.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They canceled summer school here in the nation's
capital, dimmed the lights in much of the Massachusetts Statehouse
and sent block captains out to check on the elderly in
Philadelphia's row houses.
</P>
<P>
   Relief was in sight, the National Weather Service promised, but
much of the nation _ especially the mid-Atlantic region _ was still
staggering Tuesday under the unforgiving weight of a heat wave that
broke records, sent power use soaring and kept almost everybody
racing from one air-conditioned environment to another.
</P>
<P>
   Some, of course, didn't have that option, like William Gauthier,
a 27-year-old labor foreman on Boston's massive highway
construction project known as the Big Dig. He described working in
this heat as ``terrible,'' ``horrible'' and ``the most
uncomfortable feeling in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Livezey, senior research meteorologist at the Weather
Service's climate prediction center, said late Tuesday that ``it's
clear that tomorrow will not be as bad as today and conditions will
continue to improve.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was scant solace in the here and now of a brutal
Tuesday. Jeff Moran, a spokesman for the Philadelphia Department of
Public Health, reported that there had been three heat-related
deaths there so far, all of them among the elderly. Several deaths
were also reported in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   But officials in Philadelphia and in Washington, said that they
had learned from the large number of heat-related deaths in the
past and were much better prepared for this heat wave. In
Philadelphia, people could call a special telephone number for
advice on coping with the heat _ and when warranted, be provided
with checkups by a nurse in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   In the nation's capital, Sam Jordan, director of the office of
emergency management, said officials were working with
organizations for the homeless to watch for dehydration among
people living on the streets. Officials also distributed fans to
residents of public housing projects without air-conditioning, and
set up cooling centers around the city where people could get water
and ice.
</P>
<P>
   Some people, including tourists, persevered despite the heat. At
Independence Hall in Philadelphia, 2,900 tourists trooped through
Tuesday, carrying their water bottles. But the Washington Monument
was deserted in late afternoon, with only two or three scattered
families wandering up the hill to its base. And, in an equally
telling indication of the effects of the heat, only three softball
games were underway in the area nearby.
</P>
<P>
   New England had already set a record of power use by early
afternoon, and the lights were turned out in the halls of the
Massachusetts Statehouse to show support for conservation.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Blanchard, 55, who works as a security officer at a
Boston courthouse, declared: ``If I had to compare it to hell,
Boston would be hotter. The devil doesn't stand a chance in Boston
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Kostas Havalavatos, 55, said he had gotten used to the heat
after managing eateries in Faneuil Hall for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is 100 degrees outside, it's 103 or 104 in the
kitchens,'' he said. ``I've seen guys work here for a week and then
quit because of the heat, but it's just part of the job, and I say
if they don't like the heat, they can just get out of the
kitchen.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jerry Ligon, a visitor to Boston from Edmond, Okla., said,
``It's not real hot to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Weather Service said information was still
coming in about records broken Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Chartuk, a spokesman for the National Weather Service,
said Tuesday's highs included 99 in Atlantic City and 102 at
Baltimore-Washington International Airport. He noted that over the
past 20 years, an average of 380 people die a year because of heat.
But he added that many cities have, in fact, instituted
comprehensive plans in recent years that have managed to stem those
losses.
</P>
<P>
   One of the neighborhood organizers in such a program in
Philadelphia, Shelly Thomas, sent her daughter, Latasha, over to
check on an elderly woman across the street. She found the woman
fearful of plugging in her air-conditioner, afraid it would cause a
blowout. Latasha persuaded her that it would not.

CROMER RETURNS FOR HEART TESTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Dodgers utility infielder Tripp Cromer returned to Los
Angeles for further examination Tuesday after he was diagnosed with
an irregular heartbeat. He was placed on the 15-day disabled
(retroactive to Monday) and shortstop Mark Grudzielanek was
activated.
</P>
<P>
   Cromer, 31, will undergo tests and be evaluated by team
physician Dr. Michael Mellman today at 4 p.m. at Centinela Hospital
Medical Center to determine the cause of the irregular heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a precautionary thing,'' Cromer said. ``I don't
think I'm in any immediate danger.''
</P>
<P>
   Cromer said he noticed something was wrong two weeks ago during
the Dodgers' series in San Francisco June 25-27.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something that's been every day for two weeks. It
hasn't happened for a few days,'' Cromer said. ``It's really hard
for me to describe. It's just a type of irregular heartbeat. Just a
fluttering thing. I lose my breath for a second or two.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago Cromer wore a monitor on his chest for 24 hours
in hopes the doctors would be able to detect the problem. But
Cromer said the condition did not show itself.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers trainer Charlie Strasser said Cromer didn't do any
treadmill activity to see how the heart responded. Strasser said
tests done on Cromer on three occasions were inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said the decision to send Cromer
back to L.A. was made after the two spoke before Monday's game
against Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``My anxiety is if I play him, something may happen bad at the
plate,'' Johnson said. ``I'm hoping there's nothing bad. He said he
feels better, but he doesn't feel 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Used primarily as a defensive replacement and in
double-switches, Cromer is batting .208 with two homers and eight
RBI in 29 games. He is eligible to come off the disabled list July
20. The All-Star break begins Monday, and Cromer said that was one
of the reasons he elected to go on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's anything major,'' Cromer said. ``But I
needed to get it checked. I can play baseball for four or five more
years. I have a family. I want to be around for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Grud nearly grounded: On-field fiascos are one thing, but now
poor fortune is affecting the Dodgers away from the ballpark.
Grudzielanek was in the starting lineup Tuesday against Colorado
but only after missing two flights at LAX because the United
Airlines computer randomly chose him for a bag search. Grudzielanek
was originally scheduled to board a flight at 10:40 a.m. He missed
that one and the next one before taking off at 12:10 p.m. He
arrived at Coors Field three hours before the first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty chapped,'' Grudzielanek said.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Grudzielanek, who hit .284 before the injury, was
anxious to get here. He's been on the disabled list since breaking
his hand when he punched a wall in frustration during a June 2 loss
at Pittsburgh. Johnson said last week when Grudzielanek returned,
he would reclaim his starting shortstop position from Jose
Vizcaino.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was driving me nuts to do nothing,'' said Grudzielanek, who
singled in a run in his first at-bat after missing 28 games.
</P>
<P>
   __ FYI.: For the third time this season Todd Hollandsworth
started at first in place of Eric Karros. . . . Dodgers
right-hander Antonio Osuna (elbow surgery) will pitch one inning in
a rehab start for Class-A San Bernardino tonight. . . . Colorado
right fielder Larry Walker, who leads the NL in batting at .377,
was out of the lineup with the flu.

FOCUS IS ON CHINA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLAREMONT, Calif. _ All along, Brandi Chastain wanted China.
</P>
<P>
   Not because China would be an easier opponent than Norway, but
because China brings out the best in the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say it; I prefer to play the Chinese,'' said Chastain
after Tuesday's workout at Pomona-Pitzer College. ``I enjoy the
type of soccer they play. I think it's the most challenging for us,
in terms of team organization, both attacking and defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   Both China and the U.S. finished their first training sessions
since arriving in Los Angeles after their Women's World Cup
semifinal victories last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   They will meet Saturday at the Rose Bowl for the championship.
</P>
<P>
   Since China blistered Norway, 5-0, some are wondering if the
Chinese have become the tournament favorites. The U.S. defeated
Brazil, 2-0, in the other semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't thought about that,'' Chastain said. ``We've been
concentrating on what we need to do to win the game, and not so
much who's predicting us to win or who's saying whether we will win
or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus right now is China. Everyone's so excited to play
them because they're so good. And I'm glad China's doing well
because it's getting people excited about what kind of game this
can be, or has the potential to be. For me, as a soccer player and
fan, that's the most exciting thing to be a part of.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. coach Tony DiCicco wasn't surprised at China's victory over
Norway. He was, however, surprised with the result.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw a very good China team dismantle the world champions,''
DiCicco said. ``I expected them to win. I always thought they were
a better team than Norway, but I didn't expect it to be 5-0.''
</P>
<P>
   At the 1996 Olympics, the U.S. beat China in the final to
capture the gold medal. But many feel that China is the most
improved team since that tournament. They have beaten the U.S.
twice in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Chastain explained what the U.S. needs to do, particularly
against China's speedy front line that exposed Norway:
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be organized defensively so we can win the ball.
And our transition from defending to attacking is going to be the
key because they are so quick and so organized. We're going to have
to keep them off-balance.''
</P>
<P>
   China's biggest threat is Sun Wen. The prolific scorer has seven
goals in the tournament, and finished with two against Norway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to give her the same amount of respect we gave Sissi
(Brazil),'' Chastain said. ``They both have the potential to score
any time they touch the ball, so we have to be extra conscious when
she gets into the attacking third.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very sneaky, tricky and quick. And she enjoys doing the
little extra things that allows her to get open in front of the
goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Midfield general Michelle Akers has seen her share of China over
the years. She says this is the best Chinese team she's ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to be on fire and at the top of our game
on all parts of the field if we're going to win Saturday,'' Akers
said. ``I have a general understanding of how to play against
China, but in a game like this, emotion plays a big part.''

ONCE AGAIN, KANSAS CITY'S SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PHILLIP O'CONNOR and MATT STEARNS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ For the second time in less than a week, the
top choice for Kansas City school superintendent has abruptly
withdrawn from consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the district and for Pascal Forgione Jr. negotiated
throughout the day Tuesday but were unable to reach agreement
before the school board convened in a closed meeting Tuesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
   Forgione's withdrawal prompted former Mayor Emanuel Cleaver to
call on U.S. District Judge Dean Whipple to take drastic steps to
fix the school district. But he made no specific recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaver called the district's latest efforts to recruit a
superintendent ``a national embarrassment.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before Tuesday's school board meeting, Forgione faxed a
letter to board President John Rios, saying he no longer was
interested in the position.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears to me that the gap is so broad in our negotiations
that it cannot be bridged without creating so much acrimony and
animosity that will compromise my ability to work successfully as
your superintendent,'' Forgione wrote. ``In the past I have worked
constructively and productively in partnership with boards.
However, the prospects of being cast in an adversarial role so
early in my relationship with this board is not one that I relish
or am willing to contemplate.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that he was withdrawing ``rather than continue an
unproductive interaction that will lead to more irritation and
division.''
</P>
<P>
   Forgione, a former U.S. commissioner of education statistics and
state superintendent of schools in Delaware, did not return calls
to his Washington home. His Kansas City lawyer, Norris Greer, could
not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   If Forgione does not reconsider, the board again will have to
scramble to find a superintendent. The Desegregation Monitoring
Committee, the three-member court-appointed panel that oversees the
district, has set a Friday deadline for hiring a superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   Rios said the board had directed its attorneys to find out
whether another finalist for the post, Benjamin Demps Jr., still
was interested. Demps is a retired state official from Oklahoma.
The board also asked its attorneys to seek guidance from the
Desegregation Monitoring Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Committee member Charles McClain said Tuesday night, ``It's kind
of shocking to learn that another candidate has withdrawn...I'm
very disappointed...''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would talk with the two other monitoring committee
members this morning and then try to give the school board some
guidance.
</P>
<P>
   Rios said he was trying to contact Forgione by telephone to find
out why he withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   Board members Lance Loewenstein and Lee Barnes Jr. said the
board offered Forgione a base salary of $165,800, performance
incentives that could total $33,000 a year and more than $20,000 a
year in benefits.
</P>
<P>
   That would have exceeded the salary and benefits package paid to
former Superintendent Henry Williams. Rios said the board also met
Forgione's request for a three-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   Rios said he would continue to try to persuade him to take the
job.
</P>
<P>
   But Barnes said Forgione withdrew without even making a
counteroffer.
</P>
<P>
   The board initially chose retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Jay T.
Edwards to be superintendent. But he withdrew last week after
traveling to Kansas City to meet with the school board. Edwards and
board members were unable to reach agreement on a contract. In
addition, several leaders in the minority community who met with
Edwards said he was unqualified to lead an urban district.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the black community have advocated Cleaver for the post.
But Cleaver held a press conference Tuesday to say he had no
interest in the job.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaver said he would be interested in helping to revamp how the
school district is run. The Desegregation Monitoring Committee
oversees the district, in addition to the nine-member elected
school board and the superintendent. Some board members and
previous superintendents have said that structure hamstrings the
board and the superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter who gets the job. The car is broken, and the
color of the driver doesn't matter,'' Cleaver said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who takes the job under the current conditions will not
succeed,'' Cleaver said. ``He or she will be besieged by a
community that feels it's been left out of the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleaver singled out the school board as the district's biggest
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't have the kind of acrimony and name-calling and
race-baiting that goes on in the school district and expect it to
function,'' Cleaver said. ``It's ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   If hired, Forgione would have had to unite a board and a
community that was divided over his selection. As late as Tuesday,
some board members still were advocating other candidates for the
job.
</P>
<P>
   In a radio interview Tuesday morning, board member Lee Barnes
Jr. expressed his support for Grandview Superintendent John Martin.
The Grandview educator was one of four finalists considered by the
board.
</P>
<P>
   Martin at one point said he no longer was interested in the job,
but recently said he would consider it if the board could not agree
on another candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Board member Terry Riley also criticized Forgione's lack of
experience as an urban district superintendent. He said the
district needed someone with experience working with Missouri state
proficiency tests. Martin was the only one of the four finalists
with such experience.
</P>
<P>
   Several board members said Forgione received strong
recommendations from several prominent African-Americans in
Washington and in Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very pleased with what his references said,'' said board
member Patricia Kurtz. ``It only confirmed in my mind that this is
the right person for the job and he will get along with all the
people in the community and will make sure all of the children are
included in terms of upward movement in education. He will not
leave any children behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Rios said he considered Forgione someone who could quickly
recruit and organize a quality staff and lead the district out from
under court control.
</P>
<P>
   He also said Forgione was high on accountability and would ``not
put up with the bureaucracy and what's been going on in this
district.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleaver said if a school district is functioning, a person of
mediocre talent can run it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But right now,'' he said, ``think of top superintendents in
the country who would apply for this job. They're not coming to
Kansas City.''  &LR; tag1:The Star's Lynn Horsley also contributed to
this report.

GRAPE COFFEE HOUSE AND BAR ACTS AS HAVEN FOR KANSAS TEENS

<P>
   OVERLAND PARK, Kan. _ For many teen-agers who think they suffer
a woeful fate by being from Johnson County, a sliver of salvation
sits in the middle of an Overland Park strip shopping center,
flanked by a Hy-Vee and a Tanner's Bar &AMP; Grill.
</P>
<P>
   While their urban peers flock to Westport coffee houses, some
Johnson County youths have carved out a place for their suburban
version of a kaffeeklatsch _ the Grape Coffee House and Bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an oasis in a sea of absurdity,'' said Joe Sandor, 19, a
graduate of Shawnee Mission East High School. ``It's a haven for
those who feel they don't mesh with Johnson County....You really
get to meet people (here) who don't fit the norm or the standard.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson County has plenty of teen hangouts, including other
coffee houses. But Grape fans say no other place has that special
blend of hipness, youth and coffee beans.
</P>
<P>
   The Grape, provides the stage for hundreds of Johnson County
teens and young adults to act out their daily dramas _ from
political debates to gossip to discussions about where to go next.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the gray stucco walls of the coffee house, young coffee
drinkers wearing athletic shoes or tie-dyed T-shirts clash with the
Grape's antique touches, such as vintage tea sets and Victorian-era
cabinets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never thought about the location,'' said Kate Oland, 18,
a St. Thomas Aquinas High School graduate. ``I'm just so used to
walking down to Hy-Vee to get something to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandor travels to the Grape from Lawrence, where he will attend
the University of Kansas in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years we've accumulated so many people,'' Sandor
said. ``One of the regulars might know 90 percent of the people
here. It started to become a family.''
</P>
<P>
   Oland goes to the Grape because all her friends are there, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll say, `I'll see you there,' and you don't even have to
say we're going to the Grape,'' Oland said. ``There's such a wide
range of people here. We all have the Johnson County background,
but we're not the typical spoiled brats.''
</P>
<P>
   On most nights, the small coffee shop is packed with teens,
unmindful of the line of SUVs headed for the grocery. They usually
slurp down Grape specials _ frozen mocha drinks with whipped cream
_ as they talk with friends and inhale cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   The Grape sells alcohol and tobacco, including many types of
cigars, and owner and manager Kurt Nabity said he kept a vigilant
watch over who bought and consumed what. He said most underage
teens don't try to flout the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``For kids that are 18 and who can't get into bars, this is a
smoking establishment,'' Nabity said. ``I keep an eye out for
underaged smokers and drinkers. I pretty much know the kids. I know
what age they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Bishop, who works behind the counter, said that because so
many of the teens are regulars, underage smoking and drinking isn't
a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a real tight-knit group,'' he said, standing next to a
sign that forbids minors from sitting at the bar. ``We don't have a
problem with kids trying to get alcohol. We know them.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis Buckley said that although he is 21, he doesn't go to the
Grape to drink.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've become acquainted with the people here,'' he said,
sitting at the bar with a tattered notebook. ``I come here to write
various prose and poetry. There's an ambiance that is conducive to
my writing.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria Wurtenberger, 18, said she and her friends talked, read or
played card games, checkers and chess.
</P>
<P>
   Sandor said that although Grape patrons were generally accepting
of one another, some social cliques had formed, such as groups
Sandor jokingly called the ``leftists,'' the Goth crowd or the
hippies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really not labeling, though,'' he said. ``Cliques do
form, and they take on certain characteristics....But there's no
discrimination among cliques. No matter who you are, you come here
to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Roman Goykhman, 20, and Jonya Sablin, 21, have been going to the
coffee house since they were exchange students at Shawnee Mission
West High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good place to hang,'' said Sablin, who is from Ukraine.
``And we meet people before we go places.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley Robertson, 19, a graduate of Blue Valley Northwest High
School, feels secure at the Grape, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always going to be the Grape,'' Robertson said. ``There
are people here I can relate to, and this is where I've gotten
accustomed to. I won't stop coming.''

HOUSING AUTHORITY FINDS WAYS TO HELP NEW POPULATION IN NOEL, MO. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TRISHA L. HOWARD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NOEL, Mo. _ Elias Ozuna remembers the exact date he and his
wife, Marciela, arrived in this small town in southwest Missouri:
Jan. 26, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Ozunas had come north from the Rio Grande valley in Texas,
drawn by the promise of jobs at the local poultry processing plant.
They found the jobs. Housing wasn't so easy.
</P>
<P>
   For almost six months the couple lived at Ginger Blue, a
deserted resort that housed many of the Hispanic workers who came
to Noel to work at the Hudson Foods poultry plant, now owned by
Tyson Foods. The Ozunas shared their room with two other persons.
</P>
<P>
   Soon they moved into a one-bedroom apartment managed by the Noel
Housing Authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the only opportunity we could find at that moment,''
Elias Ozuna said.
</P>
<P>
   That opportunity has led to others. Later this summer the Ozunas
will move into their new home, a three-bedroom ranch house they
bought from the housing authority.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase marks a first for both the Ozunas and the housing
authority. It also provides a benchmark for how far the housing
authority _ and its community _ have come in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   The Noel Housing Authority, once on the brink of bankruptcy and
struggling to serve the community, provides housing and literacy
services for a growing Hispanic community. Its efforts have earned
it two nominations for the Department of Housing and Urban
Development's Best Practices awards, which are given to local
agencies that use their resources wisely and creatively.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Noel's population was overwhelmingly white. In the
mid-'90s, Hispanic workers flocked to the town.
</P>
<P>
   Noel's growth came at an inopportune time for the housing
authority. By 1995, it had $7,000 in savings. Only 66 of the
authority's 100 units were occupied. The Department of Housing and
Urban Development had designated the authority as ``troubled.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, even five vacancies are rare. Reserves are up to $88,000.
A literacy program has begun, and the authority's next project
focuses on moving public housing residents into homes of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Former Mayor James Carroll remembers the first year of the
city's population boom. New workers rented garages, sheds, even a
camper shell mounted on concrete blocks _ anything for shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seemed like people kept coming and coming and
coming,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The housing authority's offerings were little better, said Joyce
Short, the executive director who took over the agency in March
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic residents often would not report problems with their
utilities. One woman spent an entire winter without hot water,
Short said. When asked, the woman said she didn't want to bother
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Ana Leland, retention coordinator for Tyson, said the housing
authority went to great lengths to make the Hispanic community feel
welcome. In addition to Leland's work for the town's multicultural
committee, she translates the housing authority's announcements
into Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no obligation for anyone in public housing to give
these services,'' said Leland, who came to the United States from
Mexico in 1995. ``If this community is advancing, it is because
Joyce has done a great effort.''
</P>
<P>
   This year the housing authority established a home-ownership
program that will start with the Ozunas. The authority bought a
three-bedroom house, appraised at $50,000, for almost half that at
a tax auction. The Ozunas turned in a bid, and the board of
directors agreed to sell the house to them for a little less than
market value.
</P>
<P>
   The authority will use the profit from that house to buy more
houses, renovate them and sell them to the authority's residents,
Short said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to get into the real estate business,'' Short
said, ``but I want to be sure that our residents can be put in
touch with the people who can get them into home ownership.
Homeownership makes a community stable.''
</P>
<P>
   Housing isn't the only topic on the authority's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the authority celebrated its family literacy
center's grand opening. The housing authority's $500,000 grant for
the center was rounded out by contributions from Crowder College in
Neosho, the HeadStart program in Joplin and the McDonald County
Library, all of which offer services at the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``This brings a level of services you might find in a larger
community to a small community like Noel that still has needs,''
said Jeff Goldammer, director of HeadStart for the Economic
Security Corp. in Joplin.
</P>
<P>
   If not for the housing authority, Goldammer said, HeadStart
could not afford to offer its program in Noel.
</P>
<P>
   The library and a computer lab are next to the classroom where
Crowder College provides courses for adults.
</P>
<P>
   Across the way, the children of those students play in a
HeadStart classroom, where the signs are written in English and
Spanish. Class breaks are timed so parents and children can spend
time together.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are young parents,'' said Carolyn Stogsdill, who teaches
the adult classes. ``If they were across town, they could be
sitting here worrying about their children instead of their
classwork.''
</P>
<P>
   Several adults who take classes here live at the housing
authority. When people apply for residence, the staff tells them
about all the other available programs _ GED, HeadStart, English as
a Second Language. The programs are open to Noel community members.
</P>
<P>
   The authority's overall goal, Short said, is to ensure not only
that its new residents have shelter but that they see a future in
Noel.

BLACKOUT STOPS TRAINS AND ELECTRICITY FOR 200,000 IN UPPER
MANHATTAN
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was a mix of chaos and calm on the streets of
upper Manhattan Tuesday night as an area including some of the
city's most impoverished and densely packed neighborhoods was
plunged into darkness.
</P>
<P>
   As of late Tuesday night, there was no violence reported in
Washington Heights or Inwood, the two affected neighborhoods, which
have more than 200,000 residents. The power failure severed subway
service above 125th Street, and at least one train was trapped in a
tunnel at 180th Street.
</P>
<P>
   For at least 40 minutes, New York Prebyterian Hospital's
emergency room lost its power. While nurses and doctors in the
emergency room had light only from hand-held flashlights, no lives
were lost.
</P>
<P>
   Power to the hospital's emergency generators was restored just
before midnight.
</P>
<P>
   With lampposts and traffic signals dead above 155th Street,
drivers crept through intersections and along dark streets, with
conditions made even more perilous by water spewing out of hundreds
of uncapped fire hydrants.
</P>
<P>
   What began as a day of sporadic power failures affecting 15,000
customers north of 155th Street turned into a total blackout at
10:10 p.m., when the remaining cables feeding the area were
overwhelmed by spiking demands for electricity, Con Edison
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   With their homes thrown into darkness, their fans and air
conditioners dead, thousands of residents poured into the streets
to marvel at a sky so black that the stars seemed startingly
bright.
</P>
<P>
   People gathered at major intersections to watch as police
officers directed traffic with flashlights and whistles. The George
Washington Bridge was illuminated only on the New Jersey side, its
New York half eerily invisible.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir said that an additional 400 to
500 officers had been sent to the area from other precincts.
Emergency police units were setting up powerful flood lights at key
intersections while city workers, using lists, were going to the
homes of those on life support to see if they needed assistance. He
said it was fortunate that the neighborhood was subjected to
partial blackouts during the day, which gave the city extra time to
prepare.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipated a worst-case scenario and the worst case
happened,'' Safir said at a news conference in Washington Heights
Tuesday night. Standing at his side, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani praised
the residents for maintaining calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've handled it in a very cooperative, very peaceful way,''
he said. ``They have really been wonderfully patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Guillermo Linares, who represents Washington Heights on the City
Council, said, ``Fortunately, people have been very calm,'' he
said. ``This is a very overcrowded community, and it has a number
of high rises, so it's a very dangerous situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the residents, the mayor criticized Con Edison for
failing to do more to prevent the blackout. ``I find it incredible,
after years and years of blackouts, that enough power can't be
supplied to the city,'' he said, as city officials braced for the
possibility of other major power failures in the Williamsburg
section of Brooklyn and Long Island City in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Lyn Rossano, 37, an epidemiologist at New York Prebyterian who
lives on 168th Street and Haven Avenue, said she was sitting at her
computer when the power failed. She said the screen flickered a few
times and then everything went dead. ``I just sat in the dark for a
while completely stunned,'' she said. ``Then I went outside to
check on what was going on and nobody seemed to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Some residents and especially shop owners were clearly nervous.
Rolando Alicia, who runs a deli at 168th Street and Broadway, said
as soon as the lights went out, he told everyone to leave his
store, locked the doors and nervously awaited the police. ``I've
experienced two previous blackouts,'' he said. ``I'm not crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   At New York Prebyterian, one nurse described a chaotic scene in
the emergency room as staff members tried to assess patients with
flashlights, and used battery powered defibrilators. ``They were
coding people in the dark,'' said the nurse, who did not give her
name.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome M. Hauer, director of the Mayor's Office of Emergency
Management, said no patients died because of the emergency room
power outage. Lights were restored about 11.45 p.m. Tuesday night.
``The hospital staff did an excellent job,'' Hauer said.

ROCKIES ROCK DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; DENVER _ Good pitching beats good hitting, but does bad hitting
offset bad pitching? The answer is unfolding at Coors Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies have the worst pitching in the National League; the
Dodgers are the worst-hitting club. Two games into the series, the
decision is leaning toward bad pitching.
</P>
<P>
   After yet another team meeting in which manager Davey Johnson
spoke with the hitters, the Dodgers managed six hits in a 5-2 loss
to the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers reach the halfway point of the season 11 games under
.500 and 11 games behind the front-running Giants going into their
Tuesday-night game with San Diego, and the idea of the playoffs is
nothing but a far-off dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know a .500 team isn't going to make it, so you have to
play 11 games over .500 in the second half just to get to .500, and
then go 15 games over that to get to the playoffs,'' said Todd
Hollandsworth, who went 1 for 4. ``You're looking at 55 wins. I'm
not saying it's hopeless. This team can catch fire. I know it. I
believe it. It's just got to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, losers of eight of their last nine, are also three
games behind, or ahead, of the Rockies (38-43) in the basement
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is getting real old,'' Dodgers leadoff-man Eric Young
said. ``It's just a shame because we've tried a lot of things. Not
any one thing seems to work. (The halfway point) means we have to
win at least 50 games in the second half to have a shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we go 50-31? We can do that. But when all of us are
struggling collectively, you're not going to muster anything.
There's not one guy hitting in our lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado starter Pedro Astacio had a 6.71 ERA at home and has
allowed the second-most hits in the NL. The Dodgers, second to last
in NL in runs scored, managed two second-inning runs off him. Six
times they were retired in order as Astacio threw his fourth
complete game. The former Dodger struck out 10 and didn't walk a
batter.
</P>
<P>
   That comes a night after Darryl Kile brought an 8.02 ERA into
Coors Field and allowed two runs in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Coors Field is supposed to be a haven for hitters. In 39 games,
teams have scored 10 or more runs 19 times. Eight times both teams
scored at least 10 runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers? They averaged three hits in the first two games
while watching their team average dip to .259. And that's nothing
new. They scored 28 runs in six games here last season. Their 4.66
runs per game was the lowest of the 12 teams to play at least five
games in the mile-high air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody makes it seem, at times, this team is lackadaisical,
and it appears that way at times,'' Hollandsworth said. ``But this
team is suffering. I think the guys are so down, we need a way to
pick ourselves up.''
</P>
<P>
   Meetings haven't helped. Meetings might be the one category in
which the Dodgers lead the league.
</P>
<P>
   The only offense they produced against Astacio came when Devon
White doubled in a run and Mark Grudzielanek had an RBI single to
give the Dodgers a 2-0 lead in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado came back with an RBI-triple by Terry Shumpert and a
single by Henry Blanco to tie it in the bottom of the inning
against Darren Dreifort (6-8). Astacio then kick-started a
three-run rally in the seventh with an RBI single to give the
Rockies a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``White got the hit, then Grud gets the hit and goes to second
on the high throw,'' Johnson said. ``We set the table for (Todd)
Hundley and (Raul) Mondesi and didn't do it. We didn't get the big
hit again. &UR;  &LR; . &UR;  &LR; . &UR;  &LR; . It's frustrating as hell.''

MABRY REMAINS IN ADJUSTMENT MODE AS M'S UTILITY MAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ There is a .300 hitter inside John Mabry. The
Mariners utility man is sure of it.
</P>
<P>
   Mabry had a .286 career average when he signed with the Mariners
last winter. But for most of this season, he's hung around .250,
never much better, never much worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're a role player or whatever, and you play every
three or four days, it just takes at-bats,'' Mabry said. ``I'm a
guy that doesn't walk very much, and that's going to have an
effect. The thing is, when you go in there and go 1-for-4 every
day, you're going to hit .250. But when you've got 200 at-bats, a
4-for-4 can put you at .270.''
</P>
<P>
   Mabry was a late addition to Tuesday night's lineup, starting in
right when designated hitter Edgar Martinez was scratched because
of a tight left hamstring. On Monday, Mabry homered for the first
time in two months _ but also struck out four times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy to see him drive the ball, because he's been
struggling a little bit,'' said manager Lou Piniella. ``We haven't
been able to play him on a regular basis, which I don't think helps
matters. But (Butch) Huskey has been swinging well, and Russ
(Davis) has picked it up a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitchers have been getting ahead of Mabry by working him away,
Piniella said, and Mabry needs to cover that part of the plate
better.
</P>
<P>
   There have been plenty of other adjustments. Mabry is getting
used to seeing more change-ups and breaking balls than he did in
the National League, where he played for the St. Louis Cardinals
from 1994 to '98. He came to the M's with just 31 career games at
third base, and has made 12 starts there this season. It's a
complicated position to learn on the fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the toughest things to do, coming off the bench, is to
play third base,'' Mabry said. ``Hopefully I'm getting better and
better every day, but it's still tough. It's not instinct for me
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither is the notion that he's a utility player. When you've
been successful as a starter (Mabry batted .307 and .297 in 1995
and '96), how do you accept it?
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't,'' Mabry said. ``It's tough _ you don't ever want to
give in and say I can't play every day, because in your mind you
think you can. Everybody wants to play every day. If you don't, you
shouldn't be out here. But some teams, that's just the way they're
built, and that's the way you've got to approach it. Just go out
and work as hard as you would if you played every day.''
</P>
<P>
   ZIMMERMAN DISABLED: The Mariners have been afflicted by a pair
of unusual injuries in recent weeks _ one travel-related, one
autograph-related.
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Jordan Zimmerman stepped on a suitcase at the team's
Anaheim hotel Monday, spraining his right ankle. The injury was
minor, and well-timed, since the M's were looking to clear a roster
spot for Tuesday night's starter, Gil Meche. They placed Zimmerman
on the 15-day disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's two or three days away from being able to fully land on
it,'' Piniella said. ``At the same time, we've suggested some
changes, and he'll be able to work with Stan when he's ready. Then
we'll send him out on a rehab, probably in a week to 10 days.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners would like Zimmerman to change the grip on his
slider, add a curveball and change the angle of his delivery on
some of his pitches.
</P>
<P>
   The autograph-related injury is Piniella's, who aggravated his
back before the trip while bending over to pick up a stack of
Safeco Field posters he had signed. Trainers and a chiropractor
have reduced the soreness, and Piniella said he's feeling better.
</P>
<P>
   ALL-STAR M'S? Piniella said he expects the Mariners to have more
All-Stars than just Ken Griffey Jr., who will start in center
field. The American League reserves will be announced Wednesday,
and one starting pitcher _ Freddy Garcia or Jamie Moyer. Plus
shortstop Alex Rodriguez, catcher Dan Wilson and designated hitter
Edgar Martinez all would seem to be candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect one of our pitchers to make it, I really do,''
Piniella said. ``I would think that Alex has a very reasonable
chance of making it as a reserve, and I think Danny should be
considered. If they take more than one DH, Edgar should be
considered also.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez has made four All-Star teams, Rodriguez three and
Wilson one. For Moyer and Garcia, it would be their first
selection.
</P>
<P>
   UNIT ON SCHEDULE: Regardless of whether he pitches in the
All-Star Game, Randy Johnson likely will start against the M's in
the Arizona Diamondbacks' series in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   According to media reports in Arizona, if Johnson pitches in the
All-Star Game, he probably would start July 18 at Safeco Field. If
he does not pitch in the All-Star Game, Johnson would start July 20
at Safeco.

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The game plan, said All-Star forward Sheryl Swoopes, was for the
Comets to show the expansion Minnesota Lynx who belonged on the
Compaq Center floor Tuesday night and who didn't.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``With Minnesota being in our same (Western) conference, we
wanted to go out and not even let them think they could play with
us,'' Swoopes said.
</P>
<P>
   It worked. On a day when three of the Comets were selected to
start on the Western Conference team in the first WNBA All-Star
Game, the Comets got virtuoso performances from nearly everyone who
played in an 80-54 win over the Lynx.
</P>
<P>
   Swoopes, the top vote-getter in the fan balloting for the
All-Star Game, contributed 15 points. Fellow All-Star Cynthia
Cooper, the second-leading vote-getter, led all scorers with 21
points and had a season-high nine assists.
</P>
<P>
   Tina Thompson, the third Comet who will start at New York's
Madison Square Garden on July 14, scored all of her 14 points in
the second half. And point guard Sonja Henning looked like an
All-Star, scoring 14 points on 6-for-8 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Even the bench brigade of Janeth Arcain, Tammy Jackson, Jennifer
Rizzotti, Amaya Valdemoro and Nyree Roberts combined for 11 points,
two steals, two assists and eight rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the first half, the Comets (11-1) had played so
well on defense, holding Minnesota to 9.5 percent shooting from the
field, it appeared they might be on the way to breaking the WNBA
record they set Saturday in beating New York 65-50 when they held
the Liberty to a league-record 21.9 percent shooting and 14 field
goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York missed a lot of shots,'' said coach Van Chancellor,
``but tonight Minnesota missed some shots because we were harassing
them. We harassed them a little better than we did against New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   The Comets go on the road for games against Sacramento and
Phoenix, two Western Conference foes they haven't faced this
season, armed with a stout defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still trying to search for our identity, what kind of
team we are, where we're going to hang our hat,'' said Lynx coach
Brian Agler. ``I think Houston is a team that has a lot of
confidence right now and they're playing well together. I think at
this point, everybody's trying to catch them and will be for a
period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no catching the Comets on Tuesday. Cooper and Henning
combined for 24 points in the first half to stake the Comets to a
36-22 lead by intermission, thanks to the game plan Swoopes
revealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had played them at their place (on June 19, a 69-55 Comets
win) and knew what to expect tonight, what they were going to do,''
Swoopes said. ``They were going to be very physical, and every
player was going to play every position.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense is a subject Chancellor loves to discuss. And he does
incessantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say it all the time,'' he said, ``you're going to win
championships when you play good defense. Defense will win for you
when you're on the road; it'll win when you're not playing good.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to imply the Comets played poorly against the Lynx
(5-5). Quite the contrary. The game was close for only about four
minutes. Henning's second basket of the night, both resulting from
Cooper assists, forged a 10-3 Comets lead.
</P>
<P>
   The lead was 34-19 with two minutes left in the first half. The
Lynx were not only having trouble scoring, but starting forward
Brandy Reed had picked up her third foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturally,'' Chancellor said, ``we wanted to go out and stop
their big guns, (leading scorer Tonya) Edwards and (third-leading
scorer) Katie Smith. But I was really worried about Brandy Reed.
What hurt Minnesota was early foul trouble. Something I always harp
on is you cannot get your key people in foul trouble. If you do,
you remove them from the game. And I thought that hurt them.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, Reed and Smith were averaging a combined 44.1 points
per game. But when the first half ended, they were a combined
4-for-21 from the field for only 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets applied the clinching blow with a 10-4 run to open
the second half. Henning knocked down a 3-pointer off an assist
from Polina Tzekova for a 46-26 lead.

 By DANNY ROBBINS  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Texas Tech track and field coach Greg Sholars, who last month was
arrested and charged with assaulting a female assistant coach, has
resigned, Tech athletic director Gerald Myers announced Tuesday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Myers' announcement _ a two-paragraph news release that gave no
reason for the resignation _ came three days after the Chronicle
reported Sholars had been charged with misdemeanor assault as a
result of a March incident in which he allegedly bit and punched
assistant coach Trece Hayslett. Despite the timing of the
announcement, Sholars said his resignation was unrelated to the
assault charge and was something he had been contemplating before
the criminal case became public. He said his plan is to return to
Fort Worth, his hometown, so he can be closer to his mother and
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole deal is very simple,'' he said Tuesday from
Lubbock. ``I've really enjoyed the opportunity I've had to work out
here at Texas Tech. My resignation was planned because of family
and personal decisions. It's very untimely that this (the assault
charge) has come out at the exact same time. It has nothing to do
with my decision to leave Texas Tech.''
</P>
<P>
   Sholars, 33, came to Tech as men's track coach in 1995 from the
University of Texas, where he had been an assistant coach in the
women's program. Tech gave him oversight of its men's and women's
programs in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   On June 11, Sholars was arrested and charged with assaulting
Hayslett, 28, a member of Sholars' staff for two years and also a
former UT employee. Hayslett told Tech police May 5 that she had
been bitten, punched and scratched by Sholars during an incident
that occurred March 16 in a parked car on the Tech campus.
</P>
<P>
   According to the offense report prepared by Tech police,
Hayslett said she was attempting to get Sholars to return a gun he
had taken from her apartment and had brought with him to the Tech
campus. The report quotes Hayslett as saying she had taken a pair
of Oakley sunglasses belonging to Sholars from his car to her own
and was bitten and punched by him when he tried to retrieve the
sunglasses, which had fallen to the floor of the car.
</P>
<P>
   The report states Hayslett reported the matter to Judith Henry,
Tech's associate athletic director/senior woman administrator, and
was led to believe the university would investigate. Hayslett told
police she tried to ``ride things out'' until the end of the
semester but wound up contacting police because she believed she
had suffered various acts of harassment by Sholars and members of
the track coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   The report cites photographic and other evidence indicating
Hayslett had teeth marks and a bruise on her left leg after the
incident. The report also quotes Henry as saying Sholars had
acknowledged to her that he had bitten Hayslett.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after reporting the matter to police, Hayslett took
a leave of absence and moved to her parents' Memphis, Tenn., home.
She told the Chronicle she subsequently was required to return all
items that had been issued to her by Tech and was informed by Henry
that June 30 would be her last day of employment at the university.
</P>
<P>
   Sholars, while declining comment on specific aspects of the
case, said Tuesday he did not assault Hayslett.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Hayslett was a very close friend of mine,'' he said,
``and this was not an assault. It was like a brother and sister
having a squabble. And once the wheels got turning (in the legal
process), it got out of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it was her choice for it to go to this point,
nor was it mine. This thing has snowballed, and it is making me
look like a villain when I'm definitely not. To be honest, this was
two friends having a squabble, and in the end it has been blown way
out of proportion.''

IT was in the fall of 1983 when Carol Vermeil took her husband for
a drive into the gorgeous rolling countryside near their suburban
Philadelphia home.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Vermeil was less than one year removed from being the
hard-driving, no-sleeping, videotape-devouring head football coach
of the Eagles, a job he took a little more seriously than life and
death.
</P>
<P>
   As the miles rolled beneath the wheels of the car, and the
landscapes _ in an explosion of autumn reds and yellows and oranges
_ slid past the windows, Dick Vermeil turned to his wife and asked:
</P>
<P>
   ``What's wrong with the trees? Are they dying?''
</P>
<P>
   Ten years after the tunnel-visioned Vermeil introduced the term
``burnout'' to the world of sports and walked away from the
sidelines in the prime of his career, the very successful Joe Gibbs
quit as head coach of the Washington Redskins, citing a need to get
away from the all-consuming pressures of the lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Now, sheer physical and mental exhaustion forces Rudy
Tomjanovich to give up his post as coach of the USA national
basketball team in the Olympic qualifying tournament that starts
next week in Puerto Rico. And the only real question is why it
hasn't happened sooner and to more of his peers.
</P>
<P>
   These are times when coaches and managers in sports are being
paid outrageous sums of money but are under incredible pressure to
produce. Which means a bigger commitment, which means ridiculous
hours. Which can mean you are left with the hollow-eyed,
raspy-voiced, limp-as-a-dishrag figure that was Tomjanovich a week
ago on the night of the NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   This has been a most strange and disturbing year to be in charge
of a Houston sports team. First, the horrible scare with Larry
Dierker and his grand mal seizure in the Astros' dugout. Now,
Tomjanovich pushes himself to the brink and has to be told one
unfathomable word by the Rockets' medical staff: Stop.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that, in many ways, they are cut from the same bolt
of cloth, a pair of former heroes for the very teams they now
manage. Both are down-to-earth and unpretentious yet as good as it
gets at what they do. Tall and strapping, bright and fun-loving,
they are the last two guys you expect to see ailing.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker's problem with a tangled knot of blood vessels in his
brain was, at least, congenital, and the prognosis is for a full
recovery and a return to the dugout in a matter of weeks.
Tomjanovich's condition, though certainly less life-threatening,
could be more difficult to overcome in the long term and may
present bigger questions in the not-too-distant future.
</P>
<P>
   The public sees Rudy T in designer suits and fancy ties in front
of the Rockets' bench. It sees the $5 million annual salary, the TV
commercials and his face up on billboards.
</P>
<P>
   What the public doesn't see is the time spent living out of an
office, skin sallow, eyes glazed over, mind numb from watching
miles of videotape or drawing up X's and O's, with sleep coming
maybe two or three hours a night on a sofa bed.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a plea for sympathy. But how long does the hamster
race around the tiny wheel inside the cage before he drops?
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that Rudy T is one of the driven, maybe
compulsive, ones. When he succeeded Don Chaney as Rockets coach in
1992, he said it was only a short-term venture. But as the years
have gone by, the coaching game, the search for more, has sunk in
its hooks and has him addicted like the strongest drug.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt the back-to-back championships raised the bar,
not only in his own mind but on the expectation levels of a city.
To many, the 1996-97 season that ended against Utah one game and a
few seconds short of another trip to the NBA Finals was seen as
utter failure. Since then, there have been two first-round playoff
losses, and nowadays, to some, any season that doesn't conclude
with a parade isn't worth remembering. Which is why the Rockets _
club owner Leslie Alexander included _ were willing to wheel Hakeem
Olajuwon out to the curb.
</P>
<P>
   Those two weeks of wrestling with the Olajuwon decision took so
much out of Rudy T, emotionally and physically. But then,
everything takes its toll because he does nothing halfway.
</P>
<P>
   Which makes you wonder, even after an imposed rest, how much
longer he can _ or wants _ to go on. Or how soon he works himself
to the nub again.
</P>
<P>
   Does executive vice president of basketball Carroll Dawson
retire or move over in the front office, giving Tomjanovich room to
assume general manager duties full-time? Does assistant coach Jim
Boylen get the reins to the club?
</P>
<P>
   Rest assured, over the next three to four weeks, these are
questions that will have to be asked.
</P>
<P>
   Exhaustively.

MARINERS BANKING TOO HEAVILY ON THEIR YOUNG ARMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Fans of irony as well as major league pitching struck
the motherlode this week.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time Randy Johnson was losing his third straight
decision for the Arizona Diamondbacks, despite allowing only four
runs and striking out 43, Mariners pitchers rang up back-to-back
shutouts.
</P>
<P>
   Dunno what the odds were for those events happening
independently, much less together, but I'll bet they were higher
even than for finding a Mariner owner who could pass a lie-detector
test.
</P>
<P>
   Both pitching developments crossed the threshold into utter
astonishment. Johnson was twice thwarted by St. Louis rookie
pitcher Jose Jimenez, a heretofore nondescript figure except for
bearing the name of a popular character created by 1960s comedian
Bill Dana.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing that the ferocious Big Unit was brought asunder by Jose
Jimenez was a little like learning that economist Alan Greenspan
had been out-forecasted by Scooby Doo.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Mariners, whose pitching has been a
compass-rose-embossed version of the train-wreck scene in ``The
Fugitive,'' drew consecutive shutouts from John Halama and Jeff
Fassero (the latter with ninth-inning help from Paul Abbott).
Records show it has been almost three years since the Mariners last
achieved the feat, although most fans would pin the previous event
somewhere between the signing of the Magna Carta and the beginning
of the Industrial Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, both shutouts were against division rivals Texas
and Anaheim, who owned the Mariners a year ago when they found
themselves in the divisional basement, 13 games out. Although early
July is hardly a pivot point in a pennant race, the Mariners
entered Tuesday night's activities four games out.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with the frustrations of their former No. 1 hurler,
Fassero, now a semi-human 9-6, optimists might suggest that the
fortunes of the most neglected aspect of the franchise have finally
turned a corner, even without acquiring Johnson's pitching
equivalent.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for you, none of that silly optimism will be found
here.
</P>
<P>
   Latest evidence against the runaway yippies took the mound
Tuesday night: Gil Meche.
</P>
<P>
   The prized phenom of the organization, coveted by multiple
rivals in numerous proposed trades, made his major league debut.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the game's outcome, it's too soon for Meche.
</P>
<P>
   Despite impressive statistics and reported uncommon maturity,
Meche has no business in the current mess.
</P>
<P>
   While I have no knowledge of Meche beyond what's been published,
any layman's awareness of human nature coupled with the high
attrition rate of 20-year-old major league pitchers, not to mention
Lou Piniella's ham-fisted handling of young pitchers, suggests that
Meche is being shoved into a phone booth rich in untrained pit
bulls.
</P>
<P>
   It is hardly coincidence that Meche's arrival coincides with the
imminent debut of the new ballpark, the latest moment of
desperation for a franchise with a 23-year history in desperation.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis du jour is that, as was pointed out by multiple
speakers at Monday's ribbon-cutting ceremony for the Guilty
Pleasure, the franchise owes the community a World Series, now that
the community has ponied up a world-class ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Ridiculous? Perhaps, but no more ridiculous than the ballpark's
final tab. And it is anything but ridiculous given that that is the
requirement suggested by Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez for
staying in Seattle after 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than respond to the crisis by seeking more expensive
talent in the offseason, ownership has decided to rob the pitching
cradle. Meche will be the fifth Seattle rookie to make his
big-league pitching debut this season.
</P>
<P>
   If he were to tread water in the next few starts, he is presumed
to become the third rookie in the starting rotation, along with
Halama and Freddy Garcia. To suggest that this is a rotation to
take into a September pennant race is even more incredible than the
owners' recent attempt to further pluck the public pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Redoubtable as have been Garcia and Halama, they still have not
survived a full season in the Piniella crucible to prove they are
not merely the next names in the Fleming/Torres/Wolcott/Cloude line
of Mariner prospects come to naught.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Mariners, they still have an out _ the July
31 trading deadline. If Meche flops in the manner of most club
farmhands, the Mariners will have a chance to go after help more
appropriate to a pennant race.
</P>
<P>
   As has been mentioned endlessly by the Mariner brass, all of
baseball is short of pitching. But by the end of this month, it's a
virtual certainty that Texas, Cleveland, Boston, Anaheim and the
Yankees will have found veteran patches for their weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   And those teams have no particular crisis in which they must
deliver quickly unto their public partners the kind of quality
their partners have delivered unto them.

SIX-RUN EIGHTH LIFTS ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK WELCH  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ When the Anaheim Angels clinched their second
American League West title in 1982, a giddy 12-year-old boy from
Huntington Beach savored the moment by running around the infield
collecting fistfuls of dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen years later, Mike Fyhrie, who was born in Long Beach,
got another chance to step onto Angels' home turf. But this time he
was the home team's starting pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   And the 29-year-old Fyhrie pitched well in his first big league
start, giving up two runs and six hits in seven innings as the
Angels defeated the Seattle Mariners, 8-2, Tuesday night at Edison
Field.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Glaus' RBI single off Mariners' reliever Frankie Rodriguez
with one out in the eighth inning snapped a 2-2 tie. Glaus' liner
to right field scored Randy Velarde and gave reliever Mark
Petkovsek (8-2) his club-leading eighth win. Petkovsek pitched the
final two innings in relief of Fyhrie.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Huson followed Glaus with an RBI single one out later to
score Garret Anderson. Gary DiSarcina and Darin Erstad each added
back-to-back, two-run singles to cap the Angels' six-run inning.
</P>
<P>
   The win also meant the Angels (38-44) cut the Texas Rangers lead
in the A.L. West to 7{ games.
</P>
<P>
   Fyhrie, the right-hander who was called up from Triple-A
Edmonton Monday, gave the Angels what they were looking for -- a
solid outing and a good number of innings.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching in front of 22,444 that included about 25 family
members and friends, Fyhrie drew raves by striking out Ken Griffey
Jr. with the bases loaded and two outs in the top of the fifth. He
struck out six and walked one while throwing 121 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels tied the game at 2-2 in the sixth inning when Seattle
starter Gil Meche, making his major league debut, walked Orlando
Palmeiro with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Fyhrie, who attended UCLA, was making his third big-league
appearance and first as an Angel. He pitched two games for the New
York Mets in 1996. Fyhrie was 8-5 with a 3.40 earned run average at
Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   Fyhrie shut down Griffey Jr. (0-3), but had trouble with
hot-hitting shortstop Alex Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez had an RBI double and hit his third solo homer of the
series off Fyhrie.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, who had limited success against Meche, the pride of
the Mariners' farm system, got a run in the bottom of the third
when Erstad's sacrifice fly scored Matt Walbeck. Walbeck doubled
down the left field line to open the third.
</P>
<P>
   The Angel offense, which was limited to three hits by Jeff
Fassero and Paul Abbott (one inning) on Monday, was again punchless
until breaking through in the eighth inning off Rodriguez (2-3).

HARDY A KING AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mark Hardy spent the majority of his 14-year NHL
career playing for the Los Angeles Kings. Today, after three
seasons as an assistant coach with the Long Beach Ice Dogs, Hardy
is expected to return to the Kings, this time as an assistant
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really excited about it,'' Hardy said Tuesday night.
``I've always been a King at heart. I've worked hard to get here.
It's my next step in life and I'm looking to be as successful as I
was with the Ice Dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardy, 40, is expected to receive a three-year contract. The NHL
source who confirmed the former defenseman's hiring said the other
assistant on new coach Andy Murray's staff will be 37-year-old Dave
Tippett, who this season coached the Houston Aeros to the
International Hockey League's Turner Cup championship.
</P>
<P>
   With Murray overseeing the team, Hardy's responsibilities are
expected to be defense and penalty killing. Tippett, who could not
be reached for comment, will focus on the offense and power play.
Tippett played for Hartford, Washington, Pittsburgh and
Philadelphia during a 721-game playing career from 1983-94.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ As much of the eastern United States sagged Tuesday
under a second day of record high temperatures, officials
attributed at least eight deaths to the heat, and the New York
region struggled with maddening power failures that trapped people
in stifling elevators, cut air-conditioning to thousands of homes
and commercial buildings, and knocked out some subway service.
</P>
<P>
   In some of the New York City's poorest neighborhoods, many
residents huddled in darkness when, just after 10 p.m., power
suddenly failed in the entire area north of 155th Street in
Manhattan, an area of about three square miles populated by over
200,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Petta, a spokesman for Con Edison, said the power failure
occurred after seven of 14 high-voltage cables that supply the area
failed.
</P>
<P>
   But early Wednesday he said the company itself cut power to
avert a broader blackout.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials made the decision after attempting and failing
to bring two of the seven malfunctioning lines back into service.
The attempt caused a small fire in a substation that feeds power to
the entire Washington Heights area. ``It presented an immediate
hazard to the personnel in that facility,'' Petta said. ``Then with
the substation and feeder lines out, the decision was made to cut
power to the entire network.''

<P>
   Con Edison officials feared that if they did not cut power, the
blackout would spread quickly to other areas in the city. ``It was
a very critical situation in which decisions had to be made very
quickly,'' Petta said.
</P>
<P>
   Early Wednesday, Con Edison officials still did not know how
long it would take to restore power to the area. ``I don't recall
in recent memory anything like this happening,'' Petta said.
</P>
<P>
   The Police Department sent hundreds of extra officers into the
blackout area, but early Wednesday morning there were no reports of
looting or disturbances. Fire officials, however, reported several
minor fires in the area. Subway lines through the neighborhood were
also out of service late Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani toured the blackout area Tuesday night.
He praised residents for remaining calm, and criticized Con Edison
for the power failure. ``I find it incredible, after years and
years of blackouts, that enough power can't be supplied to the
city,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ambulance crews in New York City responded Tuesday to more than
170 calls from people complaining of cramps and exhaustion from the
heat, and emergency officials said the heat may have contributed to
a number of heart attacks and at least three deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service reported that the temperature in
Central Park reached 101 degrees at 3:11 p.m. Tuesday, breaking the
record of 98 degrees for the date set in 1986. Temperatures were
expected to moderate this week with a cool front moving through the
region Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Summer school was canceled in Washington on Tuesday, the lights
were dimmed in much of the Massachusetts Statehouse and block
captains checked on the elderly in Philadelphia's row houses.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Giuliani said, ``This is one of the more difficult
days the city has ever had in regard to heat.'' He canceled a
political fund-raising trip to Nantucket in Massachusetts to deal
with the heat emergency.
</P>
<P>
   In the city's first confirmed heat-related death, an autopsy
Tuesday revealed that Julia Johnson, 79, of Manhattan had died of
hyperthermia on Monday, said Ellen Borakove, spokeswoman for the
office of chief medical examiner. Mrs. Johnson was found
unconscious at home by a health care worker.
</P>
<P>
   Her body temperature was 108.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said two other people may have died from the heat. They
were described as a 40-year-old man whose Brooklyn home had a
temperature in excess of 108, and a 27-year-old man who died at
Interfaith Medical Center in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Their names were not released, but neighbors identified the
40-year-old as Samuel Mitchell, a handyman from the Park Slope
section of Brooklyn, who died early Tuesday morning at Brookdale
Hospital Medical Center. Neighbors were told that dehydration was
the cause of death. Herma Passely, 59, who shared a house with
Mitchell, said he never woke up after a back yard Fourth of July
party. ``He said he was tired, went to sleep early and that was
it,'' Mrs. Passely said.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said that while they expected the death toll to
climb, they were confident it would come nowhere near the hundreds
of deaths that Chicago experienced during a brutal heat wave in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``That number might grow a bit, but certainly it will not
approach what happened in the Midwest,'' said Jerome Hauer, the
director of the Mayor's Office of Emergency Management.
</P>
<P>
   The heat wave, combined with record demands for electricity, put
enormous pressure on the power system in the New York region and
elsewhere. Transformers overheated and burst into flames. Power
lines melted through from the heat and high use. In the dense
humidity, bolts of electricity arced across power lines, causing
short circuits.
</P>
<P>
   Utility companies first issued urgent appeals for customers to
conserve energy. Later, to ease the strain on power lines and
transformers and because of insufficient power reserves, the
companies reduced their voltage output by 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, power failures were reported throughout New York City,
Long Island, Westchester County, New Jersey and Connecticut. At
least 150,000 people were affected, officials estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene McGrath, chairman of Con Edison, attributed the power
failures to equipment breakdowns, not the power cutback. ``Those
problems come about from the cables overheating,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani scolded Con Edison officials for not giving city
officials more explicit warnings about the extent of the power
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Con Ed is its own entity unto itself, and sometimes they
notify us late and sometimes they notify us only when the problem
has already started,'' the mayor said. ``I think it's a cause of
great frustration, for me and my administration and every other
mayor that's ever had this job. They call you about 10 minutes
before there is a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   New York City activated its emergency operations center Tuesday,
and Giuliani appealed for residents to avoid strenuous activity and
stay indoors near fans and air-conditioners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember hotter days than the last several and
particularly hotter nights,'' he said at a news conference at City
Hall. ``We would like everyone to be very, very careful.''
</P>
<P>
   On average, city ambulances respond to 3,000 calls a day, but
fire officials said they expected to handle more than 4,000 calls
Tuesday. ``It could be the busiest day in the department's
history,'' one fire official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a great stress on our emergency system,'' Giuliani
said.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent cars from overheating in traffic, city officials shut
down some highway construction. To keep people from overheating,
sprinkler caps were placed on open fire hydrants, extra ambulances
were pressed into service, and cooling centers were opened in
dozens of senior citizen centers and community centers operated by
the New York City Housing Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, officials opened 15 schools across the city where
anyone could sleep in the comfort of air-conditioning, Hauer said.
Cots, food and blankets were supplied by the American Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   He and other city officials credited a heat plan devised in the
aftermath of the Chicago heat wave with averting a similar disaster
in New York City. Still, there were major concerns Tuesday night,
including worries about the low water pressure in some parts of the
city. The low pressure threatened to hamper firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   On a normal day, New York City consumes 1.2 billion gallons of
water. Tuesday, the city consumed about 1.8 billion gallons, much
of that additional use spilling from open fire hydrants, Hauer
said.
</P>
<P>
   The high water consumption left some areas, especially in
Brooklyn, vulnerable to fire. ``There are some areas we are still
concerned about,'' Hauer said, adding that fire officials were
combating the problem by installing more sprinkler heads on
hydrants.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   According to meteorologists, a heat wave of this size and
intensity requires three main ingredients, and all three were
present this week. The first two are clear skies and a large mass
of hot air. But the third ingredient is the most important: a wind
from the west, a wind that comes off the Catskills and the
Appalachian Mountains, compressing and heating as it descends, then
overwhelming the cooling on-shore breeze from the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the type of pattern that generates extreme heat across
the Northeast seaboard,'' said Todd Miner, a meteorologist for
Pennsylvania State University.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Tuesday was another day of unwelcome records, both
for weather observations and for power use. Though Tuesday's high
fell short of New York City's record of 106 in 1936, back-to-back
days of temperatures above 100 degrees are rare. The last time it
happened was in July 1993. On July 9 it was 101; the next day, it
was 102.
</P>
<P>
   Despite pleas to conserve energy, both Con Edison and the Long
Island Power Authority reported record demand for electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Across the city, building managers embarked on ``load shedding''
_ shutting down two elevators in a bank of eight, or turning off
unneeded pumps and exhaust fans. On Long Island, officials
persuaded the Long Island Rail Road to slow the acceleration of its
electric trains, also to save power. But those actions were not
enough.
</P>
<P>
   In Westchester County, 10,000 customers were without power late
Tuesday afternoon. Among the hardest hit were the towns of
Harrison, Rye, Port Chester and New Rochelle. The Westchester
Medical Center in Valhalla was forced to use backup power
generators.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, a spokesman for Public Service Electric and Gas
Co. said about 9,000 commercial and residential customers had no
power Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In the most serious incident, the spokesman said, the Englewood
Hospital was reported to be without power for a period because a
backup power generator failed. Fire officials there knew of no
deaths resulting from the power failure.
</P>
<P>
   And in Connecticut, most of the city of New London and parts of
several nearby communities _ about 20,000 residents _ were without
electricity Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only once in every five years would we see an equipment
failure that would be this significant,'' said Deborah Beauchamp, a
spokeswoman for Connecticut Light and Power.
</P>
<P>
   In the Washington Heights section of Manhattan, about 15,000
homes were without power.
</P>
<P>
   At dusk, at several intersections in Washington Heights, teams
of officers were deployed with riot gear, night sticks and helmets.
</P>
<P>
   Here and there, tempers were fraying as the heat combined with
the effects of prolonged local blackouts. On Hillside Avenue, a
quiet residential street beneath one of the steep rock ridges
splitting the area, manholes popped at 11 p.m. Monday as short
circuits blew out power to several buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Two young women sat on a stoop, staring at a new Goldstar
air-conditioner still in its box. Lourdes Espinal, a 28-year-old
purchasing manager in Manhattan, laughed as she recalled how she
spent her lunch hour Tuesday hunting all over for an
air-conditioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't use it,'' she said ruefully. No electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The power failure forced sections of the subway to be closed.
Late Tuesday morning, the 1/9 train was closed from 168th Street to
242nd Street, and the A train was closed from 168th Street to 207th
Street.

BLACKOUT STOPS TRAINS AND ELECTRICITY FOR 200,000 IN UPPER
MANHATTAN
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: CORRECTING coding.) 
 (rk) 
 By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was a mix of chaos and calm on the streets of
upper Manhattan Tuesday night as an area including some of the
city's most impoverished and densely packed neighborhoods was
plunged into darkness.
</P>
<P>
   As of late Tuesday night, there was no violence reported in
Washington Heights or Inwood, the two affected neighborhoods, which
have more than 200,000 residents. The power failure severed subway
service above 125th Street, and at least one train was trapped in a
tunnel at 180th Street.
</P>
<P>
   For at least 40 minutes, New York Prebyterian Hospital's
emergency room lost its power. While nurses and doctors in the
emergency room had light only from hand-held flashlights, no lives
were lost.
</P>
<P>
   Power to the hospital's emergency generators was restored just
before midnight.
</P>
<P>
   With lampposts and traffic signals dead above 155th Street,
drivers crept through intersections and along dark streets, with
conditions made even more perilous by water spewing out of hundreds
of uncapped fire hydrants.
</P>
<P>
   What began as a day of sporadic power failures affecting 15,000
customers north of 155th Street turned into a total blackout at
10:10 p.m., when the remaining cables feeding the area were
overwhelmed by spiking demands for electricity, Con Edison
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   With their homes thrown into darkness, their fans and air
conditioners dead, thousands of residents poured into the streets
to marvel at a sky so black that the stars seemed startingly
bright.
</P>
<P>
   People gathered at major intersections to watch as police
officers directed traffic with flashlights and whistles. The George
Washington Bridge was illuminated only on the New Jersey side, its
New York half eerily invisible.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir said that an additional 400 to
500 officers had been sent to the area from other precincts.
Emergency police units were setting up powerful flood lights at key
intersections while city workers, using lists, were going to the
homes of those on life support to see if they needed assistance. He
said it was fortunate that the neighborhood was subjected to
partial blackouts during the day, which gave the city extra time to
prepare.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipated a worst-case scenario and the worst case
happened,'' Safir said at a news conference in Washington Heights
Tuesday night. Standing at his side, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani praised
the residents for maintaining calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've handled it in a very cooperative, very peaceful way,''
he said. ``They have really been wonderfully patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Guillermo Linares, who represents Washington Heights on the City
Council, said, ``Fortunately, people have been very calm,'' he
said. ``This is a very overcrowded community, and it has a number
of high rises, so it's a very dangerous situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the residents, the mayor criticized Con Edison for
failing to do more to prevent the blackout. ``I find it incredible,
after years and years of blackouts, that enough power can't be
supplied to the city,'' he said, as city officials braced for the
possibility of other major power failures in the Williamsburg
section of Brooklyn and Long Island City in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Lyn Rossano, 37, an epidemiologist at New York Prebyterian who
lives on 168th Street and Haven Avenue, said she was sitting at her
computer when the power failed. She said the screen flickered a few
times and then everything went dead. ``I just sat in the dark for a
while completely stunned,'' she said. ``Then I went outside to
check on what was going on and nobody seemed to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Some residents and especially shop owners were clearly nervous.
Rolando Alicia, who runs a deli at 168th Street and Broadway, said
as soon as the lights went out, he told everyone to leave his
store, locked the doors and nervously awaited the police. ``I've
experienced two previous blackouts,'' he said. ``I'm not crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   At New York Prebyterian, one nurse described a chaotic scene in
the emergency room as staff members tried to assess patients with
flashlights, and used battery powered defibrilators. ``They were
coding people in the dark,'' said the nurse, who did not give her
name.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome M. Hauer, director of the Mayor's Office of Emergency
Management, said no patients died because of the emergency room
power outage. Lights were restored about 11.45 p.m. Tuesday night.
``The hospital staff did an excellent job,'' Hauer said.

A PAIR OF ALL-STARS  
 BELL JOINS WILLIAMS,THANKS TO ONLINE VOTES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thanks to their friends in cyberspace, the Diamondbacks can make
a claim unmatched in the National League: They will have two
starters in next Tuesday's All-Star Game at Boston's Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Matt Williams has been pretty much a lock through
most of the voting process by the fans. But second baseman Jay Bell
staged the biggest rally this side of Harry Truman in 1948,
overtaking Houston's Craig Biggio to earn the starting nod.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first time any Diamondback has been named an
All-Star starter. Center fielder Devon White, now with the Dodgers,
was the first Arizona player to be named an All-Star. He was
selected as a reserve last season.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona could have two more players added today when the
pitching staffs and reserves are named for both leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Randy Johnson is expected to be selected by NL
Manager Bruce Bochy of the San Diego Padres and left fielder Luis
Gonzalez, who had a 30-game hitting streak this season, is a solid
candidate for a reserve spot. Despite an aggressive write-in
campaign around the state, Gonzalez was not among the top 10 in
voting released Tuesday by Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extremely surprised,'' Bell said before Tuesday's game.
``Craig has been the fair-haired second baseman in the National
League for a long time, and he has deserved it. To be elected over
him is an honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 33, finished with 1,310,799 votes and had a
comfortable margin over Atlanta's Chipper Jones, who had 653,197.
Bell, who trailed Biggio by 38,919 votes a week ago, finished with
1,203,902 to Biggio's 1,171,574, a difference of 32,328.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, also 33, was able to make up the difference and pass
Biggio due in large part to voting over the Internet. Most of the
Internet votes were not tabulated until this week. Each Internet
vote was worth 22 votes to match the average number of home games
at which ballots were counted.
</P>
<P>
   The voting was even more rewarding for Bell, who played most of
his career at shortstop but switched to second base this season.
</P>
<P>
   He responded by hitting his career-high 23rd home run in the
sixth inning against Biggio's Astros on Tuesday night at Bank One
Ballpark. Bell, who entered the game hitting .279 with 56 RBIs,
also singled in the first inning and made a tough defensive play
behind second base to force Biggio for the final out of the fifth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about whether the online voting could have helped him,
Bell smiled and said, ``My three kids have been on the Internet
constantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Biggio was gracious in his second-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a close race all the way. I knew it would be close down
to the end,'' he said. ``I'm happy for Jay. He's having a heck of a
season. I know how much it means to be voted in. It gives you more
pride.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be Bell's second All-Star appearance. While with
Pittsburgh in 1993, he was selected as a reserve shortstop, but
wound up playing second base.
</P>
<P>
   He is looking forward to renewing acquaintances with players
around the league. The other starters are St. Louis first baseman
Mark McGwire, Cincinnati shortstop Barry Larkin, New York Mets
catcher Mike Piazza, and outfielders Sammy Sosa of the Chicago
Cubs, Tony Gwynn of San Diego and Larry Walker of Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just hanging around, going to the workout the day before,
that's the fun part,'' Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   When it's 7:30 on Tuesday night, ``that's when it gets
serious,'' said Williams, who will be making his fifth All-Star
appearance, third as a starter. He was hitting .321 with 21 homers
and 75 RBIs entering Tuesday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked real hard to get here,'' Williams said. ``The fans
have been very supportive and when they vote for you, that makes
you feel good. We hope to represent the team, ourselves and Arizona
in a positive way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're both students of the game and we realize the tradition
of the All-Star Game and the ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   Managing General Partner Jerry Colangelo said that the two
players will each get a bonus of $50,000 for being elected starters
and Johnson also could receive that with a selection today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be money well-spent,'' Colangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo said he thought back to last season, when the team
struggled to a 65-97 record and Williams and Bell took heat in the
wake of signing big contracts, Bell at five years for $34 million
and Williams with a five-year, $45 million extension that began
this season.

LIMA SHORT-CIRCUITS DIAMONDBACKS  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The monsoon that swept through the Valley on Tuesday didn't cut
out the electricity inside Bank One Ballpark. But another opposing
pitcher did.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks again were without much power and another solid
starting pitching effort was wasted in a 3-1 loss to the Houston
Astros before 31,672.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Jose Lima, working on only three days' rest, picked
up his first victory in five starts, but No. 12 came with relative
ease, as he cut through the Diamondbacks' order in seven innings,
his only mistake a change-up in the sixth that Jay Bell knocked
into the left-field seats for his franchise-record 23rd homer of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Lima struck out nine and yielded just four hits.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Jay Powell and left-hander Billy Wagner limited the
Diamondbacks to a single in the final two innings. Wagner, throwing
some wicked 99 mph fastballs, retired all four batters he faced,
striking out Matt Williams, Steve Finley and Travis Lee in the
ninth to pick up his 21st save in 22 opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't solve Lima,'' Manager Buck Showalter said.
``Somewhere along the line, we've got to be able to beat guys like
him, too. We weren't able to do it, and, when you get into Wagner
area, it's pretty tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston (47-35) is 2 percentage points behind Cincinnati in the
National League Central. The Diamondbacks (45-39), who have lost
their grip in the West to the San Francisco Giants, are trying to
string some consistent games at the plate and take some of the heat
off the starters.
</P>
<P>
   Bell's homer ended a 15-inning scoreless drought for the
Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   It's been feast or famine lately for the Diamondbacks. One day,
they're setting a club record for runs. The next, they're scoring
none.
</P>
<P>
   This time, left-handler Omar Daal fell victim, as the offense
fell flat.
</P>
<P>
   Daal's only mistake was a two-run homer he gave up to left
fielder Richard Hidalgo on a 3-2 pitch in the sixth that gave
Houston (47-35) a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Daal gave up six hits, struck out seven and walked none in seven
innings.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the Diamondbacks score a club-record 17 runs in a
rout of the St. Louis Cardinals, left-hander Randy Johnson was
provided two hits in a 1-0 loss to the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   In Daal's last start, in Cincinnati, he gave up just four hits
in eight innings and didn't figure in the decision, a 2-1 loss in
10 innings.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first defeat for Daal (7-5) in nine starts. He had
a personal-best four-game win streak snapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty obvious we haven't swung the bats like we did
earlier in the year,'' Showalter said. ``It's tough to keep that
pace up, but we've gone a long way from that pace right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Daal has been reminded of last year when he was the
hard-luck loser, getting little run support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying so hard to keep the scoring down,'' Daal said.
``Last year, it happened to me a lot of time. You have to keep
working hard and try to do the best I can to help the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Daal said he got a slider up over the plate to Hidalgo.
</P>
<P>
   Lima, who likely will be selected today as one of the NL
pitchers for the All-Star Game, was so happy to get the offensive
support that he was dancing in the clubhouse while salsa music
blasted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Lima time,'' he said about the music. ``It was one of my
best games of the year, especially since I was only on three days'
rest.''
</P>
<P>
   His start was was pushed up in the rotation because of Mike
Hampton's wrist injury.
</P>
<P>
   If the Diamondbacks were going to get to Lima, it would have to
be in the first inning when he threw 36 pitches. But he managed to
get out of it without giving up a run. He helped himself by picking
off Tony Womack at first base.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next four innings, Lima threw a total of 44 pitches and
retired 11 of the 13 batters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   Daal retired 13 of 14 batters from the first to the fifth
innings and was aided by a brilliant play at second by Jay Bell,
who robbed another Bell, Derek, of a base hit.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Bell snagged Derek Bell's high hopper deep in the hole
behind second base and threw to shortstop Andy Fox for the forceout
at second to end the fifth.

ROOKIE MECHE STARTS STRONG, BUT ANGELS ERUPT LATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Lou Piniella called Gil Meche into his office
at Edison Field several hours before Tuesday night's game. The
Mariners manager went over the Anaheim Angels' hitters and talked a
little baseball with his rookie starting pitcher, and offered some
encouraging words.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him we've had some success here with some young
pitchers,'' Piniella said. ``And he can join in on the fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners and young pitchers? An unlikely match, but thanks
to Freddy Garcia and John Halama, it's been mostly successful this
year. That's a good way to sum up Meche's major league debut: he
was mostly successful.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't enough for the Mariners to win, as they fell to the
Angels, 8-2, before 22,444 fans. But the 20-year-old right-hander
gave the manager what he wanted: he pitched into the sixth inning
and gave the M's a chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   Meche worked 52/3 innings, allowing two runs on four hits and
five walks. Anaheim won the game by breaking a 2-2 tie with a
six-run eighth off reliever Frankie Rodriguez (2-3). Because the
Texas Rangers lost at Oakland, the Mariners remain four games
behind in the American League West.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought there would be more jitters,'' said Meche, who was
four levels below the majors at this time last year. ``I didn't
think I'd make that many good pitches that early in the game. It's
what I expected it to be. I knew I had to make good pitches
tonight, and I did at the right times. The only difference is being
so relaxed out there. I thought I would be a little tense.''
</P>
<P>
   There was one area in which Meche was disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked more guys than I intended to walk, which was
hopefully none,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Five pitches into the game, he fell short of that goal. Leadoff
hitter Darin Erstad walked, which Meche said was more the result of
adrenaline than nerves. He didn't walk another batter until the
fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Through five, Meche had a 2-1 lead, courtesy of a run-scoring
double in the first and a solo homer in the fourth by Alex
Rodriguez. But that was all Angels rookie Mike Fyhrie would allow.
Fyhrie, nine years older than Meche but making his first big league
start in the same game, allowed two runs on six hits and a walk in
seven innings. One of his six strikeouts was of Ken Griffey Jr.
with the bases loaded in the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just far enough outside and just far enough up to keep
us off,'' said right fielder Butch Huskey, a teammate of Fyhrie's
in the New York Mets organization. ``There weren't too many cookies
he gave up.''
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said of Meche, who gave up a few long outs
early in the game, but just one extra-base hit. He was driven from
the game not by the Angels but by his wildness: he walked Troy
Glaus to load the bases in the sixth, then walked Orlando Palmeiro
to score the tying run.
</P>
<P>
   Meche had success throwing two-seam fastballs away from
left-handed hitters. That was his plan against Palmeiro, but the
ball sunk more than he wanted it to.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in tough situations early, I just threw the ball
right through (catcher) Dan (Wilson),'' Meche said. ``That time
(against Palmeiro), I cut some off and as a result, my fastball was
in the dirt a little bit. Maybe I was pressing a little too much at
the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Rodriguez preserved the tie by getting Jeff Huson to
ground out, but he struggled in the eighth. Randy Velarde led off
with a single to second on a ball that second baseman David Bell
said ``should have been an out, no question about that.'' With
runners on first and second after an intentional walk, Glaus
singled to right to drive in the go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   A walk and three more singles would follow, and by time Velarde
ended the inning with a pop out, the Angels had put the game out of
reach.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome, this night would be memorable because of
Meche, the Mariners' No. 1 draft choice in 1996 who began the year
at Class AA New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a first outing, I think he was outstanding,'' Wilson said.
``He came up with a lot of expectations and was highly touted. I
think he met the challenge tonight. For a 20-year-old kid, he did a
great job and showed a lot of poise.''

<P>
   Thanks mostly to you, Matt Williams and Jay Bell received more
votes than any other players in the league at their positions.
</P>
<P>
   The second-year Diamondbacks are the only National League team
that will have two starters at next week's All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' election wasn't a surprise. The Diamondbacks third
baseman had been leading in the voting. He won in a landslide.
</P>
<P>
   Bell's victory was unexpected and left him grinning like an
underdog winner on election night. A week ago, the second baseman
trailed Houston's Craig Biggio. But a late surge of votes came in
like Tuesday's dust storm. Bell finished more than 30,000 votes
ahead of Biggio, who is in town this week with the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whattaya do?'' Biggio said, accepting the outcome with a
gracious smile.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known whether 1,203,902 of you cast one vote each for
Bell or whether one person voted 1,203,902 times.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely Bell and Williams were swept into the starting
lineup by thousands of Diamondbacks fans who voted early and often
for the veteran infielders. Both are having All-Star seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says a lot for the people of Arizona,'' Luis Gonzalez said.
Gonzo also has played well enough to make the team but he had
little chance of being elected (despite a write-in campaign)
because the Diamondbacks left his name off the ballot. The league's
third-leading hitter (.364) hopes to be selected as a reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans take the All-Star voting seriously. Every year
the balloting generates lively debate, righteous editorials and an
occasional stabbing. Invariably, some players get their feelings
hurt. Juan Gonzalez of the Texas Rangers is pouting this year,
vowing not to play because he isn't starting.
</P>
<P>
   Every year questions are kicked around. Should the fans vote?
Should the players select the team? How about the media? Americans
say the fans deserve to pick the starters. And most would rather
let the Red Chinese select the teams than entrust that
responsibility to sports writers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to have the fans involved,'' Biggio said. ``They
deserve to see who they want out there. It's good for the game.''
</P>
<P>
   So the fans spoke again this year, loudly, especially in
Cleveland. The Indians who sell out every game have four starters.
Cleveland fans almost voted in three others.
</P>
<P>
   Arizonans got into the civic spirit, too. ``Our ushers were
``armed'' with ballots this year,'' said Jeff Golner, Diamondbacks
game operations manager. Fans dutifully voted at Bank One Ballpark.
They also logged on and voted repeatedly (up to 22 times, the
maximum allowed) on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Their All-Star duty done, baseball fans soon will have the
opportunity to select (drumroll) the All-Century team. From
July-September Americans can cast their votes from a list of 100
nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Ballots will be available at Kmart, in special advertisements in
``TV Guide'' and ``Sports Illustrated'' and on Major League
Baseball's Web site. The team will be announced during the World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   But get this. Banned players, like Pete Rose, will be eligible
for the team, but if elected will not be able to participate in any
ceremonies or functions.
</P>
<P>
   How silly is that? &QL;

GEDNEY OUT FOR SEASON AFTER SURGERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tight end is no longer one of the deepest positions on the
Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   The team lost Chris Gedney for the season after he underwent
colon surgery Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Gedney, who will be hospitalized a week to 10 days, will have
more surgery in two to three months.
</P>
<P>
   Team officials hope that Gedney can make a full recovery and
return in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   He has suffered from ulcerative colitis, an inflammation of the
colon, for several years. His condition had been in remission, but
he was hospitalized in the past week and doctors discovered a
perforation of the colon, which required surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little shocked,'' offensive coordinator Marc Trestman
said. ``I talked to Chris Gedney in the hospital a week ago and he
was getting out. I'm disappointed for him as much as anything. I
know he was looking forward to this season.''
</P>
<P>
   Gedney has been the team's top pass-catching tight end the past
two seasons, with 45 receptions for 532 yards and five scores. Last
season, he had 22 grabs for 271 yards and one touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has such a value to this team with his multiple role in
this offense,'' Trestman said. ``He gives us flexibility. We were
able to move him around and cause some matchup (problems). We will
lose some of that. We will lose his value in the locker room and
his great practice (work) ethic.''
</P>
<P>
   With Gedney gone, Johnny McWilliams and second-year pro Terry
Hardy will be counted on heavily. The only other tight end on the
roster is Jarius Hayes, who spent most of last season as a blocking
fullback.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals likely will sign another tight end before training
camp opens July 30 in Flagstaff.
</P>
<P>
   McWilliams, who signed a one-year deal, had his best season in
1998 with 26 catches for 284 yards and one score.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy, a fifth-round pick from Southern Mississippi a year ago,
caught no passes last season but impressed the coaches and was
expected to battle for playing time this year.
</P>
<P>
   McWilliams has been slowed this summer by an ankle sprain, and
Hardy is coming off shoulder surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our depth (at tight end) is a bit diluted now,'' Trestman
said. ``But if Johnny continues to progress after last season and
Terry reaches his potential, I think we will be just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Vince Tobin and tight ends coach Hank Kuhlmann are on
vacation and could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Gedney, a 6-foot-5, 257-pound seventh-year pro, was scheduled to
earn $650,800 this season _ $516,700 in salary and $133,300 in
pro-rated signing bonus _ all of which will count against the $57.3
million salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Gedney had been injury-free the past two seasons after injuries
shortened his first four seasons. He suffered a broken collarbone
in 1993, a broken left leg in '94, an ankle sprain in '95 and a
stress fracture in his right foot in '96.
</P>
<P>
   With Gedney out, the Cardinals will be missing three key pieces
from last year's offense. Also gone are left tackle Lomas Brown,
who signed with Cleveland as a free agent, and fullback Larry
Centers, who signed with Washington on Tuesday as a free agent
after the Cardinals cut him. &QL;

CENTERS DOUBLES PLEASURE  
 SIGNS WITH SKINS TO FACE CARDS TWICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's no secret why former Cardinals running back Larry Centers
picked the Washington Redskins as his new NFL team Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to play against the Cardinals, NFC East rivals, twice a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know Larry, you know why he did what he did,''
Cardinals strong safety Tommy Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   Centers will be taking a pay cut from the $2.5 million he was
scheduled to make with the Cardinals in 1999 to a one-year deal
with the Redskins worth $675,000 _ a $425,000 signing bonus and
$250,000 in salary. Centers had also talked with the Seahawks, who
expressed some interest, and the Giants, who did not.
</P>
<P>
   With incentives, Centers, who was cut by the Cardinals on June
18, could make as much as $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming (to Washington) was a chance to play the Cardinals
twice,'' Centers said at a Washington news conference. ``This is a
business and things happen. You can't take it personally. So, I'll
just be the professional I can be.''
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledges he'll be excited Oct. 17 when the Redskins
meet the Cardinals in a nationally televised (ESPN) game at Sun
Devil Stadium. They play again Dec. 12 at Washington's Jack Kent
Cooke Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I (have) love for the fans in Phoenix,'' said Centers, a 1990
fifth-round draft pick of the Cardinals who spent nine seasons in
the Valley. ``They will be missed.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals players don't think the fans will forget Centers, the
team's all-time leading receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to have as many fans as the Cardinals do,'' said
Cardinals deep snapper Trey Junkin of Centers' return to Sun Devil
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll be shouting, `Larry, Larry,' '' running back Mario
Bates said.
</P>
<P>
   Centers said being released by the Cardinals has not shattered
his confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look down on myself because of what happened,'' said
Centers, who was cut for salary-cap reasons. ``I'm confident in my
ability to help the (Redskins) win games.''
</P>
<P>
   He will be joining a Redskins team that hasn't been to the
playoffs since 1992. But they have narrowly missed the playoffs in
two of the past three seasons when they finished 9-7 and 8-7-1.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Redskins went 6-10, including two close losses to
the Cardinals. They lost 29-27 at Sun Devil Stadium and 45-42 at
home, with Centers catching a touchdown pass in both games, his
only scores of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been a thorn in our side for many years,'' Redskins
General Manager Charley Casserly said. ``Larry Centers is one of
the premier backs in this league. In our eyes, now we're a better
football team. He's a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   In his career against the Redskins, Centers has 72 catches,
including 10 games in which he has five or more receptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just managed to do some things to knock the Redskins out,''
Centers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team is on the cusp of being a great football team. But
from what I saw the last couple of years, the focus went away at
times. Hopefully, I can not only bring some talent to the football
team but also in the locker room.''
</P>
<P>
   Centers is expected to compete with Larry Bowie for the starting
fullback job.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins also have halfbacks Skip Hicks, a second-year pro;
Stephen Davis; and Brian Mitchell, who like Centers has been a
third-down, pass-catching specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals players are certain Centers can help the Redskins in
many ways. They consider him one of the best pass-catching backs in
the league and a tough blocker on rushing defensive linemen or
blitzing linebackers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to miss Larry on the field,'' Junkin said. ``We're
going to miss Larry even more on the plane, in the locker room and
on the practice field. There are only a handful of guys in my 17
years who practiced as hard as Larry Centers.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Redskins having a bye the week before they play the
Cardinals, Centers will have two weeks to get pumped up for his
return to Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope he's not playing special teams that day,'' kicker
Joe Nedney said. &QL;

TIMMS IS SURPRISED BY ALL-STAR BERTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jennifer Gillom received almost 10,000 more votes, but Mercury
teammate Michele Timms got a starting nod in the inaugural WNBA
All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   Timms (39,171) was second to Houston's Cynthia Cooper (80,806)
in fan balloting for Western Conference guards. They will start
July 14 in New York with Los Angeles center Lisa Leslie (66,219)
and Houston forwards Sheryl Swoopes
</P>
<P>
   (84,632) and Tina Thompson (58,286).
</P>
<P>
   Leslie beat out Gillom (48,703), who has played forward all
season but was listed at center. Gillom, averaging 17 points and
7.9 rebounds per game, is a virtual lock to be named as a reserve
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie was the all-league first-team center and Gillom second in
1997. They reversed positions in '98, when Gillom was runner-up as
league Most Valuable Player.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento's Yolanda Griffith (26,061), the league's
second-leading scorer (19.9) and leading rebounder (12.8), was
third in voting at forward.
</P>
<P>
   Chosen as the East starters were the New York trio of Teresa
Weatherspoon (49,332), Rebecca Lobo (38,779) and Kym Hampton
(55,432) and the Washington duo of Chamique Holdsclaw (62,841) and
Nikki McCray (38,051).
</P>
<P>
   The 36-year-old Hampton, who has talked about this being her
final season, is Arizona State's career scoring and rebounding
leader.
</P>
<P>
   Because Lobo suffered a season-ending knee injury in the first
minute of play, a replacement starter will be named by East Coach
Linda Hill-MacDonald. The West coach will be Houston's Van
Chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   Timms, with an 8,729-vote edge over Sacramento's Ruthie
Bolton-Holifield, took her selection as a compliment and a surprise
because she was not on the all-league team in 1997 or '98.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sort of surprised that the public likes my game,'' said
Timms, 34. ``Maybe it's the Australian thing. The accent sounds a
little bit different, I guess. The Americans really like us and are
kind to us. The accent goes a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   Timms and Gillom, 35, were the first two players allocated to
the Mercury in January 1997 and have been instrumental in the
team's being a two-time playoff qualifier and '98 league finalist.
</P>
<P>
   Both made off-season training commitments for an expected
championship push, only to agonize through a 3-7 start that has
Phoenix at risk of midseason playoff elimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would give anything just to be 7-3,'' Timms said. ``As a
team, we've got a lot to work on, so while it's an honor and it's
exciting because it's history once again being made, what we need
right now is for Jen and me to be here training with the team and
not having any days off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a few things we have to work on, and that would have
been a nice week to be able to do it in.'' &QL;

OLSON SAYS HE'LL BE READY THURSDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 and DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Gregg Olson says his back feels fine and he expects to be able
to pitch Thursday when he is eligible to come off the disabled
list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good now,'' he said. ``The spasms have subsided.''
</P>
<P>
   Olson said he never had back spasms before this episode. He said
he believes the pain is the result of slipping on the mound last
week in Cincinnati while warming up in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   He has been doing exercises for his lower back and has been
taking ground balls. He said he threw three straight days in the
bullpen in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pushing it,'' Olson said. ``It's just a matter of getting
ready to go in Thursday.''
</P>
<P>
   Olson said he woke up one day in St. Louis and his back hurt.
But he said he felt good Tuesday morning when he awoke in the
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me think that the bed was making me feel a lot worse
than it is,'' Olson said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, reliever  &UR; Darren Holmes, who has been on the DL since
June 24 because of tightness in his lower back, received a second
anti-inflammatory shot Tuesday and is expected back after the
All-Star break next week. &QL; 
Shoulder checked &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander  &UR; Nelson Figueroa, who is 7-3 at Triple-A Tucson,
received good news Tuesday when a magnetic resonance imaging test
showed no rotator cuff damage in his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Figueroa, who was checked out by Diamondbacks head physician
 &UR; David Zeman, said he has inflammation and less than a 10 percent
tear in a ligament in the back of his shoulder. Figueroa said after
two weeks of rest, he should be able to resume pitching for the
Sidewinders.
</P>
<P>
   Figueroa returned from the DL and pitched six strong innings for
Tucson on July 1. Two days later, he said he had pain in his
shoulder. &QL;  &QL; 
Trade talks continue &QL;  &QL; 
General Manager  &UR; Joe Garagiola Jr. met with staff members on
Tuesday in an attempt to narrow the focus of trade possibilities.
The team continues to seek bullpen help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we accomplished what we set out to do. Now it's a
matter of continuing to work the phones,'' Garagiola said.
</P>
<P>
   Garagiola said last week that something likely will occur soon
as opposed to near the July 31 trading deadline. Something might
happen even before the All-Star break, which begins after Sunday's
interleague game against Oakland. &QL;  &QL; 
Astros stay the course &QL;  &QL; 
The second half of the season can't get much worse for the Houston
Astros.
</P>
<P>
   They lost outfielder  &UR; Moises Alou because of a knee injury to
start the season. Third baseman  &UR; Ken Caminiti has been on the
disabled list. And Manager  &UR; Larry Dierker suffered a seizure in the
dugout on June 13 and had brain surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be where we are just shows how much character we have,''
second baseman  &UR; Craig Biggio said. Its victory Tuesday night lifted
Houston into a virtual tie with Cincinnati for first place in the
National League Central.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker visited the team's clubhouse shortly after the surgery
and will attempt to rejoin the club after the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was extremely lucky to get the good care he received, that
things have gone well for him,'' Biggio said. ``It was tough to
watch, but nobody wants him back more than we do.'' &QL;  &QL;

D-BACKS' VOICE BEATS CANCER, SECONDARY ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GINTONIO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He's just another face in the crowd. You might have a neighbor
who looks like him.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Schulte has never been flashy. He has had to fight his way
through the haze and mist of being the man in the shadows. For a
quarter-century, it seemed that he was born to play the role of the
proverbial second banana.
</P>
<P>
   Then, suddenly, it was show time, and he was in the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Schulte, the radio voice of the Diamondbacks, is ``a real
warrior,'' said Jerry Colangelo, the team's managing general
partner.
</P>
<P>
   And it was that warrior mentality that enabled Schulte, 47, to
accomplish two things: He overcame big odds to get the job he
dreamed of as a kid in Illinois, and along the way, he defeated
even bigger odds to stay alive.
</P>
<P>
   It has been more than seven years since Schulte was diagnosed
with lymphoma, the same malady that struck the Atlanta Braves'
Andres Galarraga. Schulte, who still sees a doctor every six
months, is healthy, but his ordeal is something that is never far
from his thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think about it,'' he said. ``In a sense, I feel lucky.
I'm glad it was me and not one of my family members. I was able to
get through it. I never stopped and asked, `Why me?' It happens to
many other people. I just took it and then did the best I could.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt about it, it helps put things in perspective. I
appreciate my family much more now, and every chance I get during
the season, I spend time with them. I always look at the bright
side. When I wake up every morning, I think, `Boy, it's a great
day.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Schulte and wife Nancy have a son, Scott, 19, who will be a
sophomore in college, attending classes at both ASU West and
Glendale Community College, and a daughter, Stephanie, 14, who will
be a freshman at Glendale High School.
</P>
<P>
   Schulte met his wife, who also was born in Moline, Ill., at an
informal softball game before his sophomore year at St. Ambrose
College in Davenport, Iowa. She was the pitcher when he came to
bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave up a home run,'' she said. ``Then he asked me out a
little bit later.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether she thought the date would have materialized had
she struck him out, she laughed and said, ``I would hope so.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulte has come a long way from a June day in 1992 in a San
Diego hotel room when he stepped out of the shower, turned and
heard his right femur snap. The day before, he had to hobble around
Sea World, refusing to use a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had had pain in my knee before, and I had seen a doctor,''
Schulte said. ``We had pretty much determined that it was a wearing
away where the bones came together in the right knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty painful when it happened. It was determined at
the hospital that it was a tumor that snapped the bone, and they
diagnosed the fact that I had lymphoma.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulte eventually wound up with eight screws and a rod in his
leg. He underwent radiation and chemotherapy, and he said the only
side effect was the little stubble of hair that remained.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Schulte discovered a few things about human
behavior. His partner on Arizona State broadcasts, Tom Dillon, now
the play-by-play voice of the Car dinals, shaved his head, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a show of friendship, and I almost cried when I saw him
do that,'' Schulte said. ``He kind of teased me about it, and he
walks in one day and had a shaved head. That made me feel good. I
was still at KTAR at the time, and I was able to continue to do my
work on the Suns and ASU football.''
</P>
<P>
   Dillon said it's always gratifying to see someone like Schulte
pull through in ordeals like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good people, a lot of them, get tested at times,'' he
said. ``Greg is just a terrific person, a good father, husband and
family man. When the cancer came, it was basically a test for Greg,
and obviously he passed with flying colors, as most good people
will do.''
</P>
<P>
   What made Schulte's ordeal even tougher was the timing. One of
his close friends, ASU baseball Coach Jim Brock, died in 1994 while
Schulte was still in the midst of his own treatments.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Schulte has lost almost 40 pounds, has begun
to eat healthier, and he exercises about an hour and a half a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm healthy,'' he said. ``I was religious before all this
happened, and I still say my prayers and thank God that everything
is going good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm past that five-year mark now, but the doctor wants me to
come back every six months, but I think that's because she's a
Diamondbacks fan. The doctors have always been real positive about
it, and I think we've got this thing stopped. Everything looks
clean.''
</P>
<P>
   Another thing Schulte has adapted to is criticism. He's able to
shrug it off quickly and hold no grudges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing bothers me at all,'' he said. ``What I've been
through, it's a situation where criticism doesn't bother me.
Hopefully, I've learned something. And I have learned a lot from my
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   He makes no effort to hide his enthusiasm for his work. It's a
dream that began when he was a youngster who listened to Jack Buck
and Harry Caray do St. Louis Cardinals games on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my mom and dad when I was 8 years old that I wanted to
be a baseball broadcaster,'' he said. ``It took a lot of years to
get here. I was fortunate to work with Al McCoy (Suns voice) and
Tom Dillon.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me now, it's exciting every night. The job is a lot easier
now. When you're really tested is in the 14-0 games and when the
team is on a five- or six-game losing streak. The ballclub is
tested, and you're tested. We all fail a lot of tests. It's how you
come out of it that matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulte tries to spread his positive message at speaking
engagements around the Valley. He wishes he could do more of it,
and each time he does more, people, including ballplayers, learn
for the first time what he has endured.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more conscious of things now,'' he said. ``I like to keep
an eye on people and talk to people who have had some problems. We
had a tour with the Diamondbacks to Las Vegas, and we went to a
hospital and saw kids with cancer. That's the hardest thing for me
to deal with. I had it myself, but when you see a little one, it
bothers me the most.''
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo could see Schulte's workmanlike effort and
dependability from the start of their relationship, and he knew
that when the Diamondbacks became a reality that he would find a
place for Schulte.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew of his great love for baseball,'' Colangelo said.
``When he went through his health problems, we all prayed that he
would be able to make it. He went through the worst scare, when you
think about it. He was able to beat the odds and come back, and
we're all very thankful for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulte said he never minded being in the background all those
years. Now that he's achieved his goal, he takes nothing for
granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I have a pretty big part here, but I still kind of
shake my head sometimes,'' he said. '`I have to pinch myself.''

 MORO REBELS THREATEN WAR IF ESTRADA FAILS ON PROMISES  &HT;     By BENJAMIN PIMENTEL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP ABUBAKAR, Philippines _ A boy in fatigues, a rocket
launcher resting on his thin shoulder, stood guard outside Salamat
Hashim's rebel headquarters on the southern Philippine island of
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
   Hashim, chairman of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, commands
the largest insurgent army challenging President Joseph Estrada's
authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't feel uneasy hearing the sound of bombs and artillery
_ fighting is our normal life,'' said the 57-year-old Muslim
scholar, as he sat surrounded by his lieutenants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Estrada's administration is still young, but we don't think he
is aware of the trouble here in Mindanao.''
</P>
<P>
   Mindanao, the country's second-largest island, represents
Estrada's best hope and worst fear. The island is rich in natural
resources, with a dynamic economy that could help pull the
Philippines out of Asia's financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a troubled land, where the actor-turned-president
faces a resilient rebellion that could drag his year-old government
into a debilitating war.
</P>
<P>
   The MILF is fighting to establish a separate Islamic state on
Mindanao. The insurgency, which has raged for 30 years, is rooted
in the Muslim minority's struggle against the Christian migration
that displaced Muslims over the past century.
</P>
<P>
   It is also about economic opportunity. The rebels seek a greater
share of Mindanao's riches for Muslim communities, which are among
the poorest in the country and have been largely ignored by the
central government.
</P>
<P>
   The movement claims to have 120,000 troops, but the government
places its strength at only one-tenth of that. Either way, the MILF
operates an impressive 13 major camps.
</P>
<P>
   They include Camp Abubakar, which is not really a camp but a
mountainous region covering seven municipalities. Defended by 5,000
troops, it is a virtual mini-state _ with a Muslim court, a
military academy and a college offering courses in Islamic studies
and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Within its perimeter, armed guerrillas carrying M-16 rifles roam
freely among students, farmers and veiled women in traditional
Muslim attire.
</P>
<P>
   At the military academy, veteran fighters listened to a lecture
on the importance of ``secrecy and surprise'' and ``favorable
terrains'' in battles before taking a break for their afternoon
prayer.
</P>
<P>
   In the college, Muslim students studied Arabic in a classroom
divided by a plastic sheet _ one side for men, the other for women.
</P>
<P>
   The MILF claims to have full control of the 37-square-mile area,
which has a civilian population of 20,000. Along lush green
mountains, 50-caliber machine gun emplacements stand ready against
attack by helicopter gunships or jet fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Benjie Midtimbang, director of the MILF's military academy,
boasted that the rebel army, which once used hit-and-run tactics,
can now go head to head with the Philippine military in
conventional warfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are no longer adopting guerrilla warfare,'' he said. ``We
seldom step backward now.''
</P>
<P>
   The movement attracted international attention early this year
when it was reported that the MILF had purchased 3,000 anti-tank
rockets through funds received from Saudi fugitive Osama Bin Laden,
the alleged mastermind of the bombing of two U.S. embassies in East
Africa last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden is reported to have visited MILF territory, but the
rebels deny it, although Al Haj Murad, chief of staff of the MILF's
military wing, says Bin Laden has given humanitarian aid to Muslim
communities in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
   The MILF's ties to the wider Muslim world are strong. The
rebellion has received military aid from Libya. During the Afghan
war, MILF volunteers fought alongside mujahedeen. Hashim himself
spent years in exile in Egypt and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   The Mindanao Muslims, who call themselves the Bangsa Moro
nation, organized the Moro National Liberation Front to demand
independence from the Philippines in the late 1960s. Then-President
Ferdinand Marcos responded with a brutal military campaign that
caused more than 100,000 deaths over two decades. Most of the
casualties were Muslim civilians.
</P>
<P>
   A split within the MNLF between top leaders Nur Misuari and
Hashim led to the creation of the MILF in 1977. The MNLF signed a
peace accord with former President Fidel Ramos in 1996, and Misuari
was elected governor of a new autonomous region running on the
ticket of Ramos' party.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptical of autonomy, Hashim's movement has refused to give up
the fight for independence. The MILF signed a cease-fire agreement
in 1997, and Estrada has pursued peace talks begun by Ramos, but
there are still skirmishes between rebel and government forces.
</P>
<P>
   About four-fifths of Mindanao's population of 17 million is
Christian. The MILF wants to create a new state out of the Mindanao
provinces and municipalities where the island's estimated 3 million
Muslims are the majority, including territories now covered by
Misuari's autonomous government.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no solution to the problem in Mindanao except the
granting of independence,'' said Murad.
</P>
<P>
   The Estrada administration hopes to persuade the rebels to
accept some form of autonomy, similar to the agreement reached with
the MNLF.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to maintain the territorial integrity of the
Philippines,'' said presidential spokesman Jerry Barican. ``We are
hoping for a permanent solution.''
</P>
<P>
   But the talks have bogged down. Murad complains that Estrada is
unpredictable, has no experience negotiating with rebel groups and
his machismo doesn't help the process.
</P>
<P>
   When the peace negotiations stalled last year, Estrada declared:
``If they want war, then war it is.'' According to Murad, that was
interpreted by some local Philippine military commanders as a
signal to launch offensives, and fighting broke out.
</P>
<P>
   Hashim doesn't place a lot of trust in Estrada.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that what he is doing is the work of an actor,'' the
MILF chairman said, shaking his head. ``Many times, he just talks,
and it seems that he is not seriously thinking of what he's talking
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Presidential spokesman Barican defended his boss this way: ``He
perhaps doesn't use diplomatic language, but he is very frank and
open.''
</P>
<P>
   The fear is that Estrada's unbridled frankness could lead to
full-scale war. The peace talks could collapse, or the intermittent
encounters between MILF and government forces could escalate.
</P>
<P>
   That threat reverberates throughout the island. ``We hope it
doesn't happen,'' said Joji Ilagan-Bian in Davao City, Mindanao's
trade and commercial center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business will slow down,'' said Ilagan-Bian, chairwoman of the
Mindanao Business Council, which represents the island's chambers
of commerce. ``Investors will pull out.''
</P>
<P>
   War could reverse Mindanao's dramatic rise. The once-backward
region is now booming. Private investment has increased almost
tenfold since 1990, to about $2.2 billion in 1998, according to
Growth with Equity in Mindanao, a think tank funded by the U.S.
Agency for International Development.
</P>
<P>
   The island accounts for more than one-third of the Philippines'
agricultural output and close to 50 percent of its domestic food
trade. Estrada considers Mindanao critical in the fight for
national self-sufficiency that he calls ``food security.''
</P>
<P>
   The island also plays a key role in the prosperous East Asian
Growth Area, a special economic zone covering regions in Indonesia,
Brunei and Malaysia. Known as EAGA, it boasts a market of 45
million people.
</P>
<P>
   EAGA has made life rosier for Hadja Bulawan Abangon, a Muslim
merchant in Davao who sells Indonesian batik dresses, shirts and
jewelry. She said her monthly earnings have doubled since the zone
opened in 1994. And she's worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``The MILF are Muslims, but why are they causing trouble?'' she
asked.
</P>
<P>
   In Ilagan-Bian's opinion, if war erupts, the fighting would
directly affect only the small area in southwest Mindanao where the
MILF is active. But the conflict would reinforce the old images of
Mindanao as the Philippines' Wild West, too unstable for long-term
investment.
</P>
<P>
   And the MILF could broaden the conflict by setting off bombs in
Davao and other cities, analysts warn.
</P>
<P>
   The prospects for peace hinge in part on the success of the new
autonomous government under Misuari. Hashim said he and his
movement are not impressed with the progress so far.
</P>
<P>
   The government promised billions of pesos in infrastructure
investment for such projects as airports and irrigation systems,
but many of the projects are stalled. Misuari accuses the
government of blocking the release of funds, while the government
blames his inexperience as an administrator.
</P>
<P>
   With cash-strapped Manila caught in the region's economic
crisis, Mindanao's development could come too slowly to satisfy the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not simply a case of not resuming war,'' said Raphael
Lotilla, an undersecretary for socioeconomic planning, ``but how do
we manage the expectations of the MILF? What kind of development
can be introduced?''
</P>
<P>
   Mindanao historian Rudy Rodil, who helped negotiate peace with
the MNLF, said the government has funded projects in MILF
territory, including irrigation systems and a nine-kilometer
mountain road connecting Camp Abubakar to the national highway.
</P>
<P>
   But veteran MILF fighter John Abubakar scoffed at the claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you seen any bulldozers or tractors intended for
development in our area?'' he asked. ``What we have seen are tanks,
armored vehicles. We hear the sound of helicopter gunships (and)
mortars. How can we believe that the government is sincere?''
</P>
<P>
   Murad, the MILF chief of staff, said that if the rebels settle
for less than independence and the government does nothing to
develop the area, they could lose popular support and become
irrelevant. In that case, ``some other group will pursue the
struggle, so there will be no peace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That may have happened already with the MNLF, some of whose
members are said to have joined the MILF. Then there's the smaller,
more radical Muslim group Abu Sayyaf, which has staged bold raids
against government troops and kidnapped foreigners for ransom. Last
month, Abu Sayyaf abducted two Belgian visitors. The MILF helped
negotiate their release.
</P>
<P>
   Walden Bello, professor of sociology at the University of the
Philippines, believes that the rebellion will continue until Manila
alters what he calls the ``colonialist'' attitude that sees the
Moros as second-class citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless there is major change, I think Mindanao will be caught
up in permanent insurgency,'' he said. ``That will always be a very
unstable area.''

AN ACTOR PRESIDENT LIFTS HOPE OF PHILIPPINE UNDERCLASS
</HEADLINE>
 OF TWO PARTS)   &HT;     By BENJAMIN PIMENTEL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA _ Julie Angeles was describing life under Philippine
President Joseph Estrada when an oncoming train interrupted her.
</P>
<P>
   Casually, she stepped off the tracks three feet from her
scrap-wood shack in Manila's San Andres Bukid district and waited
for the train to pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been some change but life is still hard for us, the
poor,'' said the 32-year-old widow, who washes clothes to support
her four children. ``Erap won't be able to solve everything.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Estrada, a former movie star known by the nickname
``Erap,'' derived from the Tagalog word for ``buddy,'' won a
landslide victory campaigning on the slogan ``Erap Is for the
Poor.''
</P>
<P>
   But playing champion to the country's impoverished masses is a
tough act, even for a president who used to play a street-smart
defender of the underdog in action movies.
</P>
<P>
   Although Estrada has turned the national spotlight on the
poverty issue like no other Philippine president, and he remains
popular with the poor, he has yet to make an impact on their lives.
There are some who fear he never will _ because of his ties to the
rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a president who undoubtedly still has a strong base
of political support,'' said Temario Rivera, a political science
professor at the University of the Philippines. ``But Erap is
hobbled by his ties to vested interests _ his cronies.''
</P>
<P>
   About a third of the archipelago's 75 million people live in
extreme poverty, many in slums along railroad tracks or on garbage
dumps.
</P>
<P>
   Their numbers have grown during the past year. A decline in
manufacturing resulting from the Asian financial crisis cut tens of
thousands of jobs. Unemployment is at 9 percent, up slightly from
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada intends to reduce the number of poor Filipinos to a
quarter of the population by the end of his six-year presidency in
2004. He speaks often of ``poverty eradication'' and ``food
security.''
</P>
<P>
   Estrada's anti-poverty campaign has three major components:
</P>
<P>
   -- Agrarian reform. Two-thirds of the poor live in the
countryside, where they work as sharecroppers for large landowners.
</P>
<P>
   -- Infrastructure improvements. An $80 billion program focuses
on water systems, housing for the poor and communal irrigation.
</P>
<P>
   -- Job creation. The government is counting on an annual
economic growth rate of 5 percent during the next six years to
boost employment.
</P>
<P>
   To stimulate social reforms at the grass roots, Estrada turned
to the country's network of nongovernmental organizations. They
helped convene the National Anti-Poverty Commission, which drafted
his social reform agenda and is supposed to implement it.
</P>
<P>
   But Ana Maria Nemenzo, the commission's vice chairwoman,
acknowledges that the war on poverty is stalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't done much,'' she said. ``It's been frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Estrada, the panel's chairman, puts the blame on lack of money
and the fact that the economy is still reeling from the Asian
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, the economy has remained stable in the 12 months
since he took office, growing by 1 percent in the first quarter of
1999 after declining for almost a year.
</P>
<P>
   The inflation rate _ 7 percent _ is down slightly from the
previous year. And the Philippine Stock Market has doubled in size
to about 2,500 points since Estrada took over in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But Estrada's government faces a $1.8 billion deficit this year
alone, and the country is paying off a $48 billion foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very frustrated when I cannot give and implement
projects which I promised to the people due to lack of funds,''
Estrada said at a May forum for journalists in Manila. ``All
projects boil down to funding.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the anti-poverty campaign gets under way, it will be
implemented by a sluggish government bureaucracy in a political
culture vulnerable to corruption and shallow theatrics.
</P>
<P>
   Similar campaigns failed in the past because politicians
diverted funds to their own pockets or used them for insignificant
projects, such as bus stops or basketball courts in rural barrios,
that served as billboards for their ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   And in many cities and towns, alleviating poverty has been a
quid-pro-quo exercise: Politicians give the poor handouts and
expect loyalty _ and votes _ in return.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada, who was a township mayor for 17 years before becoming a
senator, comes from that tradition. ``Erap doesn't understand
poverty,'' said journalist Sheila Coronel, who has written
extensively on the Philippine presidency. ``The most he has done
for the poor was the handouts he gave as mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics say he's doing it again as president. One of the goals
of his anti-poverty campaign is to identify and assist the 100
poorest families in every town and city. The plan has been called
paternalistic and vulnerable to manipulation by unscrupulous local
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous,'' said Pancho Lara, a social activist and
consultant to the Department of Agrarian Reform. ``If you target
only 100 families, they're the only ones you'll reach.''
</P>
<P>
   Estrada has served notice that he won't tolerate corruption,
delivering a tough ``don't test me'' warning to friends and family
members. The statement has come back to haunt him. He has awarded
government positions to relatives and friends, many of whom are
either unqualified or have shady backgrounds _ or both.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Jimenez, a presidential assistant for Latin American
affairs, is wanted by the U.S. Justice Department for tax evasion
and making illegal campaign contributions to President Clinton's
1996 re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Another presidential consultant, Cecilia De Castro, a relative
of Estrada's, was accused of being involved in a much-publicized
corruption scandal. She allegedly was linked to a group that tried
to bribe government officials to release about $5 million for a
textbook project. The case is still under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   With Estrada in power, some of his friends _ including powerful
industrialists and landlords with links to former strongman
Ferdinand Marcos _ appear to have gained more influence.
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent, Eduardo Cojuangco, was a Marcos crony who
fled with the late dictator during the 1986 People Power uprising.
Cojuangco's holdings, including the prestigious San Miguel Corp.,
one of the country's biggest and oldest companies, were then
confiscated by the government of former President Corazon Aquino.
</P>
<P>
   Cojuangco returned to the Philippines several years ago and has
been trying to recover his assets. Just days after Estrada took
office, Cojuangco was elected chairman of San Miguel's board. The
move was not illegal, but critics called it a corporate coup _ and
evidence that Cojuangco felt he had nothing to worry about with
Estrada in power.
</P>
<P>
   Lucio Tan, owner of a major cigarette company, who  &LR; also had
links to Marcos. Tan was a target of tax evasion cases filed by the
administration of former President Fidel Ramos. But after Estrada
took over, the cases either stalled or individual claims against
Tan were drastically reduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``The face of cronyism is clearly in place in the first year of
the Erap administration,'' said Rivera, the political science
professor.
</P>
<P>
   He believes Estrada inevitably will find himself torn between
the reforms he espouses and the interests of his friends.
</P>
<P>
   An important test case is the government's plan to redistribute
some 21/2 million acres of land to the rural poor, part of an
agrarian reform program that began in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   But the Congress, which is dominated by landowners, slashed this
year's budget for land acquisition by about 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Cojuangco, who owns some of the country's biggest plantations,
has joined other landowners in pushing an alternative plan that
would allow them to maintain control of their estates through joint
ventures with poor farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada's agrarian secretary, Horacio Morales, a respected
social activist, has been critical of such schemes, fearing that
the farmers would be manipulated into signing unfair agreements.
</P>
<P>
   While the dispute has yet to be resolved, leaders of
nongovernmental organizations were chagrined when Estrada praised
Cojuangco's plan, calling him the ``godfather of land reform.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Will the likes of Morales and the younger,
development-oriented technocrats and legislators prevail over the
likes of Cojuangco?'' Rivera asked. ``Being a product of the old
corrupt order, Erap is constrained. I think that the powerful
conservative cronies have the upper hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Estrada vehemently denies that he coddles cronies. But the
perception has cost him some support with the middle class, the
nongovernmental organizations and the business sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``If before we were open to the possibility that this is going
to be a truly pro-poor government, we have more doubts now,'' said
Corazon Juliano-Soliman, chairwoman of the Caucus of Development
NGOs, a major coalition. ``The inconsistency is more and more
pronounced.''
</P>
<P>
   Businessman and political analyst Antonio Gatmaitan, who is
based in Makati City, the country's financial center, spoke of ``a
growing unease'' among some business leaders about Estrada. He
described Estrada's relationship with entrepreneurs and investors
as ``cool and a bit distant.''
</P>
<P>
   Estrada's controversial lifestyle has not helped.
</P>
<P>
   Middle class Filipinos frown at his reputed penchant for
late-night partying, which has made him miss appointments. He
showed up late at a dialogue at the presidential palace in May with
Manila bishops and businessmen. Then he was impatient when a
businessman expressed concern over layoffs and other social costs
of opening the economy to foreign competition.
</P>
<P>
   While past presidents were college educated, formal in demeanor
and given to flowery speeches in English, Estrada, a college
dropout, speaks street Tagalog and has an aversion to long
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada asks his critics to be patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everything is going the right way now,'' the president
said recently. ``I've only been 10 months in office. Please give me
a little more time. I cannot solve this all at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   That request resonates with poor Filipinos, including many in
San Andres Bukid, where most people don't have steady jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is just starting, but there are many people attacking
him,'' said 41-year-old Cesar Valdez, standing on the same train
tracks that Julie Angeles had stepped off. ``Erap is for the
masses.''
</P>
<P>
   And the masses are for him. Estrada's approval rating was 67
percent in March, up from 61 percent last September, according to
the Social Weather Station, a respected research organization in
Manila. Analysts attribute the high numbers to his lingering
celebrity as an actor who once played working-class heroes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very challenging because the president is someone who
connects with the poor more than we do,'' said Juliano-Soliman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He personifies the macho savior of the poor. The poor identify
with him. ``But that does not make him a good president.''
</P>
<P>
   Some nongovernmental organization leaders see opportunities for
small but meaningful changes under Estrada. De la Torre says the
president has budding instincts for social reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``His deepest source of personal frustration is that he doesn't
feel he's got a solid working program for the poor _ which speaks
of his value system,'' De la Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada has made an impact already just by moving poverty to
center stage in Philippine politics. In past administrations, the
issue was peripheral to the goals of industrialization and rapid
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Coronel, the journalist, said Estrada has forced other
politicians to pay attention to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He pointed out the voting power of that constituency and, in
the future, other leaders will have to address that constituency,''
she said. ``It furthers the democratic process.''
</P>
<P>
   But businessman Gatmaitan warned that ``the day of reckoning is
approaching when people will be less forgiving in their criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``That goes for the underclass that supports him,'' Gatmaitan
added. ``Their patience may be much longer _ but, eventually, he
has got to deliver.''
</P>
<P>
   If Estrada doesn't, more poor Filipinos could turn to a
historically attractive alternative: the armed left.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, the communist New People's Army thrived in poor
barrios and slums through its militant Robin Hood tactics of
attacking rich landlords and organizing workers and peasants. Now
weak and divided, the armed left has no real chance to grab power,
but analysts believe it can stir unrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Estrada is competing with the left as far as that constituency
is concerned,'' Gatmaitan said. ``There are discordant notes that
are beginning to appear.''
</P>
<P>
   An entire chorus can be heard in a slum neighborhood called Tent
City, located across the street from the House of Representatives
in Quezon City.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Tent City's 600-plus squatter families campaigned and
voted for Estrada, who they hoped would help them find new homes
and jobs. But the community's leaders accuse the president of
breaking his promise to give each family about $4,000 for
relocation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Erap is for the poor? It's been the reverse _ Erap is for the
rich,'' said Moises Talisik, the chairman of Tent City's community
organization.
</P>
<P>
   His sentiments are shared by others in Tent City.
</P>
<P>
   As rain fell outside her makeshift shack, Felicidad Roque, 75,
wiped tears from her sunburned face as she spoke of how she helped
campaign for Estrada _ but got nothing in return.
</P>
<P>
   She pointed to where rain leaks into the cramped home she shares
with her son and granddaughter. Sometimes, they eat only once a
day, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day, one eat _ I don't lie to you,'' she said, choking
back tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people here are suffocating,'' she said. ``I hoped for big
things from Erap _ but that hope is broken.''
</P>
<P>
   Near the busy street dividing the poor community from the
government compound on the other side, Lito Buta, a 21-year-old
construction worker, sat with neighbors and relatives in front a
white coffin. Buta said it contained the the body of his mother,
who died of an ulcer at age 62.
</P>
<P>
   ``She often went hungry, and we couldn't afford medicine,'' he
said. ``I really idolized Erap. But he's not listening to us now.''

   1. WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT STANLEY KUBRICK After Stanley Kubrick
died in his sleep of a heart attack on March 7, even the New York
tabloids reported the news with an auteur slant, headlining the
director's generally bleak view of life. Words like ``secretive,''
``reclusive,'' ``strange,'' ``mysterious'' and ``cold'' were
repeatedly used to describe him. On the eve of the U.S. opening of
his last film, ``Eyes Wide Open,'' starring Nicole Kidman and Tom
Cruise, the people who knew Kubrick best reminisce. By Peter
Bogdanovich. From The New York Times Magazine. Full-length (9,000
words) + edited article available.
_____________________________________________________________ 2.
SALMA HAYEK GOES 'WEST' Mexican actress Salma Hayek's profile will
be higher than ever as she opens opposite Will Smith and Kevin
Kline in ``The Wild Wild West,'' this summer's comedy/action film.
Hayek encountered a lot of prejudice in her career at first, as she
could not speak English well. Now she harnesses her
visibility-raising energies on behalf of Mexico. By Jay Carr. From
The Boston Globe. 1,400 words + photo.
_____________________________________________________________ 3.
THE DARK SIDE OF HOLLYWOOD'S SUPERTHIN,
</P>
<P>
   SUPERSTARVED SUPERSTARS Many actresses have recently been
photographed looking rake-thin. And if you think they look skinny
on camera (which traditionally adds 10 pounds,) you should see them
in real life. ``Boys with breasts,'' Tom Wolfe calls them. ``This
may be politically incorrect, but I find it fascinating how ugly,
starved, bony women can be considered attractive,'' says Dr. Arnold
Anderson, director of the Eating Disorders Unit at the University
of Iowa College of Medicine. Writer/producer David Kelley, who
created hit TV shows ``The Practice'' and ``Ally McBeal,'' is well
aware of the controversy over his stars' appearance. By Ivor Davis.
1,300 words + photos. (N/A Great Britain and Australia.)
_____________________________________________________________ 4.
THE BIG PICTURE For super-sharp 3D images, throw away your lens. A
three-dimensional computer image of a plastic dinosaur might be the
first step towards bringing viewers television in true 3D. You
won't need a front row seat for your favourite sports game when you
can have a 3D viewer at home. By Charles Seife. From New Scientist
magazine. 500 words. (N/A Brazil, Australia, New Zealand.) 5.
AMATEUR HOUR For centuries, it has been noted that musical training
is a helpful background for training in the sciences. It is no
accident that the 92 contestants in the first Van Cliburn
International Piano Competition for Outstanding Amateurs included
lawyers, professors, computer whizzes, a TV anchorman, plus
numerous doctors and medical specialists. (The winner, Joel
Holoubek, is a French coin dealer.) By Richard Dyer. From The
Boston Globe. 1,900 words + photo.
_____________________________________________________________ 6.
RAY PARK : YOU'VE GOT MAUL ``Han Solo always got the girl and he
was very cool,'' says Ray Park, the soft-spoken Scottish actor who
portrays Darth Maul in ``Star Wars : The Phantom Menace.'' (Darth
Maul is the Sith Lord audiences love to hate.) ``I wanted to be Han
Solo, but with Jedi powers and a lightsaber. It's a bit ironic that
I'm playing Darth Maul. ... I didn't think Darth Maul would be so
big.'' Only 24 years old, Park holds a second-degree black belt and
is a veteran of numerous martial arts competitions. By Ian
Spelling. 1,000 words + photos.
_____________________________________________________________7.
DONNY OSMOND COMES TO TERMS WITH FAME At the height of his fame,
singer Donny Osmond had a squeaky-clean, bright-and-smiling image,
but few people have witnessed the flip side : a history of
self-doubts, debilitating fears and serious reversals of fortune.
Now the 41-year-old father of four is setting the record straight
with his candid autobiography ``Life Is Just What You Make It.'' By
Christopher Loudon. From TV Guide Canada. 1,300 words + photo. Q&AMP;A
format.
_____________________________________________________________ 8.
JACKIE COLLINS' HOLLYWOOD LIVES With 200 million copies of 21 books
sold in more than 40 countries, Jackie Collins is the McDonalds of
the bestseller lists. The sister of actress Joan Collins, Jackie
has been a star in her own right since she published her first
novel, ``The World Is Full of Married Men,'' in 1968. Such
provocative tales as ``Hollywood Wives'' give her readers the
delicious illusion of inside knowledge on Tinseltown's dirty little
secrets. By Ivor Davis. 1,300 words + photos. Q&AMP;A format. (N/A
Great Britain and Australia.)

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: The all-purpose hater
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his brief but effective bid for the Let's Hate Each Other
Hall of Fame, Benjamin Nathaniel Smith materialized in one
frightful moment as a kind of equal-opportunity assassin. In the
few minutes it took, Smith killed two people and wounded nine the
other day in the region around Chicago. The blacks, Jews and Asians
he gunned down were all the same to him.
</P>
<P>
   Although the 21-year-old Smith had achieved some small notoriety
for bigotry at Indiana University, pitifully little is to be
learned from Smith's brief killing spree. He is dead by his own
hand, and cannot discuss his grievances. In a free society, no
screening procedure was likely to have found and stopped him.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lesson in this. And that is that the religious and
racial minorities Smith targeted _ and those he lacked time for _
don't have a moment to bicker with each other. The result so far
seems to have been a debilitating struggle over who gets to occupy
society's lowest rung. No one has time. We need to see an assault
on one as an assault on all, not someone else's private lookout.
</P>

   MASSAGE-PARLORS (San Francisco) _ The city of San Francisco may
transfer regulation of massage parlors from the police department

TORASSA.

   SINGLES-THERAPY (San Francisco) _ Through the ages, men and
women have found diverse places to meet _ at bars, through friends,

   SCOTLAND (Edinburgh, Scotland) _ Scotland is a land where past

There's still a wee bit of the Highland rebel in the hearts of many
loyal Scots. And for visitors, the rich traditions, coupled with
the green hills, the rocky Highland crags and the friendly people,

Professional Baseball,'' anthropologist George Gmelch has trained a
scholar's eye on the national pastime. Getting there wasn't easy
for this onetime player who would never made it to the big leagues.
By ANDREW BROWNSTEIN.
</P>
<P>
   BBN-EXPOS-SURVIVAL (Montreal) _ There is a growing sense in
Montreal that the Expos organization is knowingly, willingly and
gladly sabotaging baseball. The mission, some people believe, is
twofold _ low attendance could help the club convince voters that a
new stadium must be built for it in downtown Montreal, or the
franchise will be sold and relocated, probably to Charlotte, N.C.
By TIM REYNOLDS.
</P>
<P>
   X-GAMES (San Francisco) _ The X Games went over big here and

   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ If you want a reality check in
Cleveland or Chicago, you probably talk to a machinist or

<P>
   WONG-COLUMN (Oakland, Calif.) _ Saturday's final game in the

sporting entertainment at its finest. Our world being what it is,
however, it could also be the latest loyalty test for Chinese
Americans and perhaps many other Asian Americans. By WILLIAM WONG.

 &HT;    The time is out of joint in Austin
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ If you're new to Austin, you should know that
this city has its own unique time zone. It's pretty simple. Austin
Standard Time or Austin Daylight Saving Time both run about 15 or
20 minutes off from Central Standard or Central Daylight Time.
</P>
<P>
   Being a punctual person, the unofficial Austin time zone is
annoying to me. But it's like the heat. It's a part of living here
that you have to accept or go crazy, and here's how it works:
</P>
<P>
   If it's, say, 8 p.m. in Dallas, Houston or Lubbock, it's around
7:40 or 7:45 p.m. in Austin. Or at least Austinites think it is.
This is why everything starts late in Austin, and everybody runs
late. Because of AST and ADST, people think they have more time
than they actually do.
</P>
<P>
   When you go to a club in Austin for the 10 o'clock set, don't be
surprised if the band doesn't show up on stage till around 10:15 or
10:20 p.m. If you go out to dinner and the maitre d' tells you
there will be a 20-minute wait, there will be a 40-minute wait.
</P>
<P>
   This is all because of our unusual little time warp here in this
mecca of tardiness. I don't know what causes it. I suspect it's the
mold spores.
</P>
<P>
   So I was not surprised when I arrived at World Gym in Southwest
Austin around 9:45 Monday morning to find the place closed, even
though the sign on the door said the gym was supposed to open at 8.
</P>
<P>
   The building was locked, the lights were turned off, and there
was nobody around _ except for the angry group of about 40 club
members in workout clothes waiting out front to get in.
</P>
<P>
   These people were like your lips after water-skiing _ real
chapped. They were mad. They clearly did not understand the concept
of Austin Standard or Austin Daylight Savings Time.
</P>
<P>
   I felt sorry for the poor guy named Russell, I'd guess in his
mid-20s, a World Gym employee who showed up in front of the place
to appease the crowd at about 10 minutes to 10 a.m. _ with no key
to open up the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``My name is Russell,'' said Russell, confronting a tough
audience. ``I overslept. I'm sorry.'' Then Russell announced
someone was supposed to be coming soon with the key.
</P>
<P>
   ``How far away does he live?'' a gal in the crowd asked in a
get-a-rope tone of voice.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these people had been waiting in front of the building
since 8 in the morning, and they were in a
``I'm-writing-a-letter-to-the-corporate-office'' mood. I could
sympathize with them. No one had told them about AST or ADST.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so World Gym screwed up. But let's put this in Austin time
zone perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say that running this gym requires a crew of about, oh,
say, a half-dozen minimum-wage college kids who spent the previous
night going from one Sixth Street dive to the next, enjoying bands
with names like Mange Puppy.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say each gym employee saw two different bands, and each
band started playing 20 minutes late. Add it up. That's four hours
accumulated ADST late time right there.
</P>
<P>
   So when World Gym finally threw open its doors at 9:55 Monday
morning, when it was supposed to open at 8, it was really opening
about two hours early. By Austin standards. Y'all need to know
these things if you're going to remain sane in this town.

 &HT;    Delivering the message of `contraceptive equity'
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ In many ways, our society seems light years away
from 1968, when Mary Brookins started working at Planned Parenthood
of the Miami Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Her job title back then was ``information specialist,'' but what
she really did was walk door to door in neighborhoods all over the
city to inform women about the agency and its services. Most women
had never heard of Planned Parenthood. Many had never heard of the
birth control pill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the husbands didn't want anything to do with birth
control, so the women didn't make appointments,'' Brookins
recalled. ``But some came to see us, after all, on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   How times have changed since then _ or have they? Last week, as
Brookins retired from Planned Parenthood after 31 years, The New
York Times published a front-page story on ``contraceptive
equity.'' The gist of the story: It is only now, as Viagra is being
quickly included in many insurance plans, that state legislatures
are taking a taking a serious look at coverage for women's
contraceptives.
</P>
<P>
   When she started working at Planned Parenthood at the age of 32,
Brookins had recently given birth to her sixth child _ unplanned _
and needed the extra income, as well as an excuse to get out of the
house. She had no idea that for the next three decades she would be
a foot soldier in the battle for contraceptive equity _ a battle
that, as The Times' story indicates, is far from over.
</P>
<P>
   ``That little blue pill gave the birth control pill that's been
around for 40 years great crediblity as an issue,'' California
Senator Jackie Speier told The Times.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Viagra controversy, more than a half-dozen
states have passed legislation requiring carriers that cover
prescription drugs to pay for contraceptives for women.
</P>
<P>
   It figures. It just figures. Even at $10 a pop, that little blue
pill gains instant respect from insurance companies. For four
decades, meanwhile, women have paid out of pocket to control their
childbearing destiny.
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of thing that makes us younger feminists want to
spit tacks. ``Back in 1968, when Mary started, everyone thought of
birth control as this great beginning, an opportunity for women to
control their lives, and how many children they have,'' said Noreen
Willhelm, director of special projects for the Planned Parenthood
Association of the Greater Miami Valley. ``Thirty-one years later,
it is still women's responsibility, and it has been women's
financial responsibility. Women's health care expenses are
astronomical compared to men, largely because of birth control
pills.''
</P>
<P>
   Brookins takes the long view. Having spent nearly half of her
life at Planned Parenthood, Brookins can see how much progress has
been made, as well as how much remains to be achieved. ``She's the
most calm, unflappable person,'' Willhelm said. ``She's everybody's
hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Brookins noted with a chuckle, ``I had six children in eight
years; I didn't know anything about Planned Parenthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love all my kids,'' she added, ``but I'd have found a way to
space them better, if I could. Back then, even if you had six
children, your husband had to sign for you if you wanted your tubes
tied.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first year on the job, Brookins persevered with her
door-to-door message despite the slap-in-the-face racism of some of
the people who answered the door, like the woman who said, ``It's
people like you who are having all these babies.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, she assumed various roles at Planned Parenthood,
from clinic manager to her most recent role as family planning
assistant. She was there during the dynamic tenure of Faye
Wattleton, who in 1978 went on to become president of the Planned
Parenthood Federation of America. ``She was wonderful,'' Brookins
recalled. ``I knew she was going places, but I didn't know she was
going there.''
</P>
<P>
   As a family planning assistant, Brookins served as a patient
advocate, helping them with paper work and accompanying them to
appointments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love my job,'' she said. ``I love having the contact with
the young girls. I'm like a mother figure to them. I can talk to
them when they're upset, and listen to them. Some girls just tell
you everything you don't want to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Brookins has been invaluable, Willhelm said, as someone who
``sees what real life is about, someone with incredible amounts of
experience, both personal and professional.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that work must go on without her. Brookins plans to enjoy
retirement in her Lower Dayton View home, spending time with
husband Edward, with her nine grandchildren and five
great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   A lot has happened in the 31 years since Mary Brookins took her
message door to door.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that it's not only the obvious disparity in
insurance companies' coverage that's bringing about change. The New
York Times reported that ``the speedy success of so many
contraception bills reflects only good timing but also the rising
power of women in state legislatures.''
</P>
<P>
   Their work is possible because of front-line people like Mary
Brookins, who delivered the message door to door, patient by
patient, day by day.

 &HT;    Whether you crank it or zip it, car radios are a part of life
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Late one summer night in 1949, my father fell
asleep coming home from work and ran his V-8 Ford into the back of
a parked car.
</P>
<P>
   He wound up in the hospital, and from that point on we wound up
with radios in our family cars.
</P>
<P>
   Radios did not come as standard equipment on all cars in the
1940s. Still, they hardly were novelty accessories.
</P>
<P>
   My father thought car radios were a waste of money. There was
nothing on the radio that he wanted to hear.
</P>
<P>
   That made absolutely no sense to me. Practically everything I
wanted to hear was on the radio. Most importantly, there was good
music on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   Even before rock 'n' roll, radio stations catered to the music
preferred by young people. Those stations were required listening
for teens and pre-teens. I was a pre-teen.
</P>
<P>
   I have no idea who made the requirement that young people must
listen to certain radio stations. I don't know how we all
simultaneously knew that certain radio stations were required
listening, but we knew.
</P>
<P>
   One clue might have been that any radio station our parents
couldn't stand was one we probably should like.
</P>
<P>
   My father particularly disliked disc jockeys and their
insufferable attempts at humor. ``Insufferable'' was his word.
Although I could see he had a point, I still thought
``insufferable'' was a particularly harsh assessment of DJs who
were directing their energies toward entertaining young people.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he thought it preferable to suffer the intellectual
indignities of a car radio than risk falling asleep again at the
wheel late some night on the way home from work.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the next struggle was getting him to turn the darn
thing on whenever he drove us to town, on Sunday evening drives or
on family vacations.
</P>
<P>
   By himself, he evidently preferred his own thoughts to the
distractions of a radio. With others, he might still have preferred
his own thoughts except he generally encouraged family
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   I would have much preferred to listen to the radio than be asked
about my school studies or be drawn into discussions about world
events that were more like school lessons.
</P>
<P>
   When I got old enough to buy my own cars and live on my own, I
always installed the biggest, loudest most technologically advanced
sound systems that I could afford. That'll show him.
</P>
<P>
   Even years after his death, I remember wondering what my father
would think when I crammed enough speakers and amplifiers into my
car to make me fear that the lug nuts would vibrate off the wheels.
</P>
<P>
   When CD players first came on the market, I rigged one up in my
car. That's was several years before CD players were manufactured
for automobiles. The contraption never did work very well because I
couldn't cushion it enough to prevent it from skipping. But it was
roundly hailed as an extremely powerful technological marvel when
the car was sitting still.
</P>
<P>
   In my house, I installed a stereo system that would knock the
spackling off the ceiling. That was years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago I purchased another car. A longtime friend who
lives in another city asked if I had the car long enough to put in
a state-of-the-art sound system.
</P>
<P>
   No, I said, the radio that came with the car is good enough for
me. I never turn it on.
</P>
<P>
   Why? I don't know why.
</P>
<P>
   It was never a conscious decision, but over the past several
years I kept turning down the volume. Finally, I quit turning the
darn thing on.
</P>
<P>
   I now prefer my own thoughts to the distractions of a car radio,
tape deck or CD player. It's strange how things turn out.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you tell me how to get in touch with former Sen. Bill
Bradley's presidential campaign?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Democrat's official website _ www.billbradley.com _
offers many options for campaign contributions, plus information on
Bradley and some of his speeches. To get in touch with the campaign
the old-fashioned way, write Bill Bradley for President, Inc., 396
Pleasant Valley Way, West Orange, N.J. 07052. Or call the campaign
headquarters toll-free at 1-888-643-9799.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a Government Approval form to have the air bag on-off
switch installed in my Ford. I have yet to find a Ford dealership
that will install this switch or even deactivate the driver's side
air bag. What do I do?
</P>
<P>
   A: It would be difficult to find a dealership willing to do this
for your car. Dealerships shy away from this kind of work due to
the liability involved in it. To have this work done, try going to
an after-market air-conditioning repair shop, or a stereo
installation specialist. The best solution, though, would be to
contact Ford Motor Co. and see what they recommend. Their toll-free
customer service number is 1-800-392-3673. Q: How do the Serbs and
the Albanians identify each other as enemies? They look exactly
alike to me. Is it a language difference? But then how could they
kill each other at a distance?
</P>
<P>
   A: To understand how ethnic Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo
province could identify one another when they appear to look so
much alike, you much first understand they exist in two nearly
separate societies. The schools, churches, businesses and
neighborhoods _ even whole villages _ were separate.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs are Orthodox Christian; Albanians are Muslim. So even if
an ethnic Albanian looked like a Serb, you could likely tell he was
Albanian because of the neighborhood he lived, stores he shopped
at, church he attended, or where his children went to school.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, the physical differences _ even posture, walk,
mannerisms, dress, etc. _ between ethnic Serbs and ethnic Albanians
in Kosovo is not really stark enough for anyone to recognize. This
helps explain why many of the recent atrocities were up-close and
personal. Kosovar Serbs and Albanians identify one another most
easily through their language, which is very different. For
example, they have entirely different names for each city, town and
village in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   This ``separate society'' way of living in the province helps
explain why it was so easy for Serb troops and police to target
ethnic Albanians en masse during the NATO bombing campaign. You
could go to a whole town and wipe out hundreds of Albanians at
once, never concerned about killing a Serb, or vice-versa. Or if
you saw a convoy of people on a road during the bombing campaign,
you could be quite certain they were Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Were the Atlanta Hawks ever members of the ABA before they
came to Atlanta? Which league, if any, were they a part of before
joining the NBA? A friend of mine and I have been arguing about
this and would love an answer to settle the score.
</P>
<P>
   A: Hopefully, this will provide the olive branch of peace,
depending on who is on which side of the fight. The Atlanta Hawks
had never been in the American Basketball Association. The
basketball team was founded in 1945 as the Buffalo Bisons, a member
of the National Basketball League. Then they changed cities and
played as the Tri-Cities Blackhawks in 1946, while still remaining
in the NBL.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Hawks franchise had become the Milwaukee Hawks,
in 1951, they had joined the NBA _ and there they remained. After
Milwaukee, they moved to St. Louis in 1955, eventually coming to
roost in Atlanta in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Just out of curiosity, what does the Libertarian Party stand
for? What is its party platform?
</P>
<P>
   A: In the words of Bill Winter, Libertarian Party director of
communications, ``The party platform calls for vigorous defense of
the Bill of Rights, free enterprise, civil liberties, free trade,
no meddling overseas, and private charity.'' For more information,
you may write to the party headquarters: 2600 Virginia Ave. NW,
Suite 100, Washington DC 20037.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We heard an official say firefighters always carry portable
hydrants. Now, what in the world is a portable hydrant?
</P>
<P>
   A: Portable hydrants are an appliance that essentially lets
other hoses be hooked up to a hose that has water in it. Mainly,
this lets other ``appliances,'' such as other fire hoses or deluge
guns, known to the layman as water cannons, take and distribute the
water from a supply hose rather than have each appliance hooked up
individually to a fire hydrant.
</P>
<P>
   You must have a water supply _ whether it's a tank truck, creek,
pond or a fire hydrant _ to fill your firefighting hoses. Then,
with a portable hydrant, you can drop one hose in the pond (or hook
it up to a distant hydrant) and feed several other hoses or
appliances off that one.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I get a schedule for Turner Classic Movies?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you're online, this address _
http://TCM.turner.com/CALENDAR/month/ _ will give you the current
month's programs. Or to order the Now Playing Guide, call
1-800-826-1002 or write: Now Playing, P.O. Box 420934, Palm Coast,
FL 32142-0934. The cost for the guide, issued monthly, is $9.97 for
one year, $19.94 for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported recently that Coca-Cola at one time was ``the
second-most valuable company in America.'' What company is
currently the most valuable?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's Microsoft. It had a market value (as of the end of June)
of $452.97 billion. The second-most valuable company was General
Electric, with a market value of $358.88 billion. Although
Coca-Cola has slipped, don't shed too many tears. Its market value
was $152.68 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Market values and rankings obviously are subject to fluctuation
as stock prices change, but with Microsoft so far ahead of all the
other companies, even General Electric, its top ranking isn't
likely to change soon.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article about Elton John left me with a question:
Wasn't he engaged or married at one point?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, the singer was married for a short time, as has been
widely reported. After an engagement of five days, John was wed to
German sound engineer Renate Blauel on Feb. 14, 1984, in Australia.
John and his bride had met in mid-1982 at London's AIR Studio while
John was dubbing vocals for his 1983 album, ``Too Low for Zero,''
and later, on Montserrat, the two reportedly had discussed the
possibility of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   There were no children born to John and Blauel. The pair often
lived continents apart for months at a time, and on Nov. 18, 1988,
their no-fault divorce was announced. Blauel said she and John were
parting amicably ``and genuinely intend to remain the best of
friends.'' After the divorce, she withdrew to the 17th century
cottage in England she received in the settlement, along with a sum
reported to be as high as $45 million.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that information about the new Gemini North telescope
can be found on the Internet, but no URL was listed. Do you know
what it is?
</P>
<P>
   A: For information about Gemini Observatory, try this site _
www.noao.edu/usgp _ which is operated by the National Optical
Astronomy Observatories.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When and where will the Libertarian Party nominating national
convention be held, and who can I contact to attend?
</P>
<P>
   A: The convention will be June 30-July 3, 2000, in Anaheim,
Calif. Delegates who will vote to select the presidential candidate
must be selected by the 50 state affiliate parties, said spokesman
Bill Winter at the party's Washington headquarters. A lot of the
convention, however, is open to the public, such as some business
sessions, some speeches, and some political workshops. And there's
a ``good chance'' that C-SPAN will televise most or all of the
convention, Winter added. You can call 202-333-0008, extension 228,
to be put on a mailing list for updates.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who is Mia Hamm, and why is such a fuss being made about her?
</P>
<P>
   A: Soccer superstar Hamm is the celebrated 27-year-old forward
on the U.S. national team playing for the World Cup. She has been
very much in the news of late _ ranking, in fact, at the top of a
Sports Business Daily survey on ``most marketable female
athletes,'' ahead of Michelle Kwan, Venus Williams and Tara
Lipinski.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Hamm's accomplishments are her membership on the 1996
Olympic gold medal and 1991 World Cup championship teams, all-time
record of 109 international goals, four championships at the
University of North Carolina, endorsements for Nike, appearances in
Gatorade and Pert shampoo commercials. She even was dubbed by
People magazine as one of its ``50 Most Beautiful People.''

<P>
   Q: We heard an official say firefighters always carry portable
hydrants. Now, what in the world is a portable hydrant?
</P>
<P>
   A: Portable hydrants are an appliance that essentially lets
other hoses be hooked up to a hose that has water in it. Mainly,
this lets other ``appliances,'' such as other fire hoses or deluge
guns, known to the layman as water cannons, take and distribute the
water from a supply hose rather than have each appliance hooked up
individually to a fire hydrant.
</P>
<P>
   You must have a water supply _ whether it's a tank truck, creek,
pond or a fire hydrant _ to fill your firefighting hoses. Then,
with a portable hydrant, you can drop one hose in the pond (or hook
it up to a distant hydrant) and feed several other hoses or
appliances off that one.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I get a schedule for Turner Classic Movies?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you're online, this address _
http://TCM.turner.com/CALENDAR/month/ _ will give you the current
month's programs. Or to order the Now Playing Guide, call
1-800-826-1002 or write: Now Playing, P.O. Box 420934, Palm Coast,
FL 32142-0934. The cost for the guide, issued monthly, is $9.97 for
one year, $19.94 for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported recently that Coca-Cola at one time was ``the
second-most valuable company in America.'' What company is
currently the most valuable?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's Microsoft. It had a market value (as of the end of June)
of $452.97 billion. The second-most valuable company was General
Electric, with a market value of $358.88 billion. Although
Coca-Cola has slipped, don't shed too many tears. Its market value
was $152.68 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Market values and rankings obviously are subject to fluctuation
as stock prices change, but with Microsoft so far ahead of all the
other companies, even General Electric, its top ranking isn't
likely to change soon.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article about Elton John left me with a question:
Wasn't he engaged or married at one point?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, the singer was married for a short time, as has been
widely reported. After an engagement of five days, John was wed to
German sound engineer Renate Blauel on Feb. 14, 1984, in Australia.
John and his bride had met in mid-1982 at London's AIR Studio while
John was dubbing vocals for his 1983 album, ``Too Low for Zero,''
and later, on Montserrat, the two reportedly had discussed the
possibility of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   There were no children born to John and Blauel. The pair often
lived continents apart for months at a time, and on Nov. 18, 1988,
their no-fault divorce was announced. Blauel said she and John were
parting amicably ``and genuinely intend to remain the best of
friends.'' After the divorce, she withdrew to the 17th century
cottage in England she received in the settlement, along with a sum
reported to be as high as $45 million.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that information about the new Gemini North telescope
can be found on the Internet, but no URL was listed. Do you know
what it is?
</P>
<P>
   A: For information about Gemini Observatory, try this site _
www.noao.edu/usgp _ which is operated by the National Optical
Astronomy Observatories.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When and where will the Libertarian Party nominating national
convention be held, and who can I contact to attend?
</P>
<P>
   A: The convention will be June 30-July 3, 2000, in Anaheim,
Calif. Delegates who will vote to select the presidential candidate
must be selected by the 50 state affiliate parties, said spokesman
Bill Winter at the party's Washington headquarters. A lot of the
convention, however, is open to the public, such as some business
sessions, some speeches, and some political workshops. And there's
a ``good chance'' that C-SPAN will televise most or all of the
convention, Winter added. You can call 202-333-0008, extension 228,
to be put on a mailing list for updates.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who is Mia Hamm, and why is such a fuss being made about her?
</P>
<P>
   A: Soccer superstar Hamm is the celebrated 27-year-old forward
on the U.S. national team playing for the World Cup. She has been
very much in the news of late _ ranking, in fact, at the top of a
Sports Business Daily survey on ``most marketable female
athletes,'' ahead of Michelle Kwan, Venus Williams and Tara
Lipinski.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Hamm's accomplishments are her membership on the 1996
Olympic gold medal and 1991 World Cup championship teams, all-time
record of 109 international goals, four championships at the
University of North Carolina, endorsements for Nike, appearances in
Gatorade and Pert shampoo commercials. She even was dubbed by
People magazine as one of its ``50 Most Beautiful People.''

   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ The carnage in Kosovo was the first story
I have covered that was bigger than it looked on television.
</P>
<P>
   The casualties in 1992's Hurricane Andrew were limited and life
continued in many parts of Miami. Last December's bombing of Iraq
provided good televised fireworks, but most Iraqis were barely
inconvenienced.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo was a story of blind ethnic hatred -- the poison that
germinates with simple bigotry and transforms so easily into
bloodshed. Its ravages are not confinable to a television screen.
</P>
<P>
   The acts of evil were too numerous for a journalist to report
and too vast to escape.
</P>
<P>
   There were body parts and weeping mothers that never made it
into my stories. Our hotel meeting place stood above a basement
strewn with the eerie debris of Serb paramilitary gangs. Nights
were punctuated by bursts of gunfire and the barking of stray dogs,
once pets, now traveling in wild packs.
</P>
<P>
   The battle lines were vague; the borders unmarked and innocent
mistakes could be terrifying. But, reality did not hit me until I
foolishly tried to take a day off.
</P>
<P>
   I rode with a fellow journalist to pick up a car her company was
sending from Belgrade. The rendezvous point got switched and we got
lost.
</P>
<P>
   We strayed across the unmarked border and wandered about 4 miles
out of NATO-controlled Kosovo into Serb-controlled Yugoslavia,
where we were held at a Serb police checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
   It was their right to stop us. We were in Serbia -- Yugoslavia's
dominant republic, and of which Kosovo is a province -- without
Yugoslav visas. But things got complicated.
</P>
<P>
   A non-uniformed Serb, drinking beer in the shade, blew up at the
site of our two Kosovar Albanian drivers. He threatened to slit my
friend's throat, then drew a pistol from a holster and threatened
to shoot. His police friends half-heartedly persuaded him to calm
down and told us to sit in the car.
</P>
<P>
   There, I fearfully and surreptitiously ate the press card issued
to me by the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, the Serbs' hated enemy.
</P>
<P>
   We were luckier than I expected. After a trip to a police
station, we were released.
</P>
<P>
   My story is trivial in contrast to the deaths of thousands of
ethnic Albanians here. But, it taught me that there could be no
respite from Kosovo's hatred and horrors.
</P>
<P>
   So overwhelming was the nightmare that it's hard for me to
imagine that people can go on living here.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters lamented the incredible sights we left out of stories.
What about the house where Serbs used their victims blood to write
anti-NATO graffiti on the white walls? How about the dismembered
foot by the road? It was all pushed out by other items more gory or
urgent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the echoes of war prolonged the danger.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees and journalists alike had to watch for trip wires and
land mines. Inspecting charred corpses in one burned house, we
carefully avoided a metal disk spotted beneath rubble on the floor.
To my astonishment, an Australian cameraman then backed up right on
top of it. It wasn't a mine.
</P>
<P>
   One night, I found NATO troops removing machine guns and
detonators from the apartment across the hall. They belonged to a
couple whose sons had been Serb paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the man there threatened some Kosovar Albanians
and they split his head open. A trail of blood lead from our
hallway, down 180 steps and into a plaza nearby.
</P>
<P>
   I moved out, but blood was commonplace. In the Grand Hotel, a
dilapidated Serb-run tower that smells of urine and was home for
much of the press, blood trailed inexplicably down the marble steps
to the basement.
</P>
<P>
   The basement, including a small bowling alley, disco and
conference rooms, was used as a barracks by Serb soldiers. A friend
and I searched it and our little Maglites spotlighted their creepy
artifacts -- clothes, boots, alcohol bottles and syringes, which
were purportedly used for the amphetamines that helped the Serbs
manage their vast murderous workload.
</P>
<P>
   Above ground, almost every ethnic Albanian I met had loved ones
killed or missing. People cried unexpectedly. Death and loss became
the vehicles for bonding.
</P>
<P>
   In our spare time, Fanton, my ethnic Albanian driver, took me to
a mass grave he had discovered.
</P>
<P>
   There were four patches of loose dirt in a hilltop graveyard.
Maybe, I said and wished, they were just paupers' graves.
</P>
<P>
   When he showed me what he said was the back of a skull
protruding from the ground, I suggested it was a rock. We tapped it
with sticks. It sounded too solid for bone.
</P>
<P>
   But, we stripped away a little soil and the stench of human
decay, now familiar to me, rose from the grave. Hair still clung to
a strip of dried skin.
</P>
<P>
   Under Muslim custom, no one would be buried face down, without a
shroud and just inches from the surface. This was a murder victim.
This was a man or woman whose relatives now missed someone --if
they themselves had survived.
</P>
<P>
   Just as it was foolish of me to ever hope for a day off in
Kosovo, I had foolish to think this object in the dirt could have
been anything but a skull. It was another tragedy, lost and
anonymous among the thousands of tragedies in Kosovo.

<P>
   Even now that Memorial Day and the Fourth of July have come and
gone, the siren song of sizzling meat over hot coals continues
inexorably to draw us outdoors. While eating on porches, patios, at
poolside or under a favorite backyard tree adds immeasurable
enjoyment to the season, there are certain necessary adjustments
that should be made to summerize your kitchen routine.
</P>
<P>
   Upgrading your grilling skills, revising your summer recipe file
and food safety factors should all be considered as the season
swelters on. Here are a few Internet sites to get you up to snuff
for a summer of outdoor dining.
</P>
<P>
   MAKE-AHEAD RECIPES

familiar with make-ahead and quick-fix summer salads will go a long
way in getting you out of the kitchen and outdoors to join the fun.

   Brushed with a citrusy chili-infused dressing, this salad's
succulent fresh sweet corn, zucchini, yellow squash, and tomatoes
acquire robust flavors from the grill. Lightly grilled
cheese-and-onion-filled flour tortillas round out the meal.
</P>
<P>
   Chili-Lime Dressing:
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons lime juice
</P>
<P>
   3/4 teaspoon chili powder
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
</P>
<P>
   Vegetables:
</P>
<P>
   4 small ears yellow corn
</P>
<P>
   2 6-ounce zucchini
</P>
<P>
   2 6-ounce yellow squash
</P>
<P>
   4 small ripe plum tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   4 6-inch-round flour tortillas
</P>
<P>
   8 tablespoons shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
</P>
<P>
   1 green onion, cut crosswise into 2-inch lengths, then
lengthwise into thin strips
</P>
<P>
   Lettuce leaves
</P>
<P>
   Heat outdoor grill. Coat grill rack with nonstick vegetable
cooking spray.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare Chili-Lime Dressing: In jar with tight-fitting lid,
combine oil, lime juice, chili, cumin, salt, and garlic powder
until well mixed. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Carefully pull back husks from corn, leaving them attached at
base and remove all the silk. Brush corn with some Chili-Lime
Dressing. Place corn on tray while preparing other vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Cut zucchini and squash crosswise in half. Cut halves lengthwise
into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Place vegetables on tray with corn.
Brush slices on both sides with some dressing. Cut tomatoes
lengthwise into halves and brush with some dressing.
</P>
<P>
   Place corn about 4 inches from medium-hot coals so husks hang
off the edge of the grill. Using the husks to turn ears
occasionally, grill corn until kernels are lightly browned _ 8 to10
minutes. Transfer corn to a tray once it's done.
</P>
<P>
   Grill zucchini and yellow squash, turning occasionally until
lightly browned _ 2 to 3 minutes. As they are done, transfer to
large tray. Grill tomatoes, turning once, just until softened _ 1
1/2 to 2 minutes in all. Transfer tomatoes to tray with other
vegetables and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Heat flour tortillas, one at a time, over low coals, turning
often just until softened _ 15 to 20 seconds. Sprinkle 2
tablespoons shredded cheese and one fourth of green onion strips on
half of tortilla. Fold tortilla in half and grill just until cheese
softens. Fold tortilla in half again and transfer to tray with
corn. Repeat to heat, fill, and fold remaining 3 tortillas.
</P>
<P>
   Just before serving, line 4 plates with some lettuce leaves. Cut
corn kernels off cobs and set aside. Arrange one-fourth of zucchini
and yellow squash alternately with each other on one side of each
plate. Mound corn in center and garnish with tomato halves and
folded tortillas. Pass remaining Chili-Lime Dressing.

 &HT;    Light ale for those with taste for brew
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Greg Kelly does more than play defense man for his
amateur hockey team. First he donated the team's name, the Laughing
Skulls. Then he began donating the after-game beer. Whatever his
contributions on the ice, you have to say Kelly's doing his part.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, the founder of Atlanta Brewing Co., maker of Red Brick
Ale, Laughing Skull pilsener and other beers, has made his hockey
mates a kind of test market. These are men who can still call
themselves young for a few more years (``most of 'em are in their
late 30s and early 40s''), expend more energy than the couch
potatoes arriving at middle age ahead of schedule, and guess what
their beer of choice is?
</P>
<P>
   ``Kelly's Lite is first, then Laughing Skull and then Red Brick
Ale,'' the team's provisioner of malts and hops proudly declares.
</P>
<P>
   It's been five years since Atlanta Brewing Co. debuted its Red
Brick Ale, one more craft beer among dozens of others. Kelly, a
former sales manager for Guinness, was intent on bringing craft
beer to Atlanta, but _ by his own admission _ he was no hophead. He
still isn't. What sells in Seattle and Portland doesn't necessarily
sell in Atlanta _ or it doesn't sell in the volume that will
satisfy someone who is first and last a businessman.
</P>
<P>
   While others were celebrating highly hopped ales from the West
Coast and elsewhere, Kelly couldn't help noticing how many people
nonetheless drank ``light'' beer. In fact, light beer, introduced
more than 20 years ago, now commands more than a third of the
market. If anything, its mass-market success threatens to embarrass
the very people who created it. Light beer was meant to be a brand
on the side, not a competitor to a company's flagship beer. Yet
Miller Lite outsells anything else the company makes. The once chic
Coors, a beer that was light-bodied to begin with, is outsold by
Coors Light.
</P>
<P>
   And, although no one's placing bets, Bud Light _ No. 2 with 11.4
percent of the market _ has been slowly gaining on none other than
the King of Beers, with 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This is the market that Kelly, risking some of his credibility
as a craft brewer, has set his sights on. It's also one he has
found hard to penetrate.
</P>
<P>
   At a Publix grocery store last week, you could have found any of
the brand-name lights, along with less familiar ones. But you
couldn't have found Kelly's Light. At a party in my neighborhood
recently, you would have noticed one person after another sipping
lights from cans encased in Styrofoam _ but no one was drinking
Kelly's Light.
</P>
<P>
   What's surprising about this is that Kelly's Light is far better
than Bud Light, Miller Lite, Coors Light, Busch Lite, Michelob
Light, Natural Lite. It's the only light beer that actually tastes
like beer, and yet not many people besides a few amateur hockey
players know what it is.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Peck, who works at Mac's Beer &AMP; Wine in Atlanta, is among
those who have recommended it to customers shopping for a light.
``That beer actually has some malt quality to it, and it's not
watery,'' Peck says. Unlike most mass-market light, it's made
entirely from barley, with no additions of corn or rice. And the
stone brewing _ superheated stones immersed in the brewing kettle _
imparts a slight nutty flavor.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact is that most people don't ``shop'' for a light in
the way many would shop for a chardonnay or a cabernet sauvignon,
an India Pale Ale or a stout. They pick it off the shelves as they
do soda pop. It's a matter of stimulus and response. Eyes catch
familiar label, arm extends, hand grasps. Not a lot of gustatory
consideration goes into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have found it harder than we expected,'' Kelly says. ``In a
lot of places, it hasn't been discovered yet.'' Kelly knew
light-beer drinkers bought the label more than the beer, but he
believed a light that was flavorful and well-made would find its
audience. Even so, Atlanta Brewing Co. has been careful not to
advertise the fact that Kelly's Light is an ale and not a lager.
``We were afraid it would frighten people off,'' Kelly says.
</P>
<P>
   But basic distinctions between ale and lager, talk of two-row
barley, the different properties of various hops _ light-beer
drinkers aren't interested. For these folks, beer's beer, and it's
to sip or guzzle but not really enjoy for its own sake.
</P>
<P>
   And in a calorie-counting culture, the lighter the beer, the
better. Assured of its ``lightness,'' many blithely assume they can
drink twice as much without getting drunk or fat. So they buy it in
``suitcases,'' big 12-packs and, now, 18 packs. Nothing light about
that.
</P>
<P>
   Light beers aren't for me, but they're obviously for many
people, from sweaty goalies to neighbors picnicking over barbecued
pig. I've often wondered why they didn't just drink a Coke _ it has
more flavor. (Ah, but no alcohol.) I wouldn't wonder that about
someone drinking a Kelly's Light. I might suggest he move up a
notch to Red Brick Summer Brew, whose malts and hops are
practically the same, but at least he has a taste for beer.
</P>
<P>
   PICK OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   John Maier not only likes to push the stylistic envelope with
his beers but have fun with them in other ways, too. ``What's this
Pacman yeast you use?'' someone asks him, reading the detailed
ingredients on the 22-ounce silk-screened ceramic bottle. ``Oh,
that's a joke,'' Maier says. ``It's just our proprietary yeast.''
</P>
<P>
   Other beers in the Rogue line commemorate friends and locals in
the Pacific coastal town of Newport, Ore., where Maier has won
medal upon medal for his individualistic beers.
</P>
<P>
   Brutal Bitter was brewed in honor of a friend and publican in
Portland, and quickly acquired a following in the Northwest. New to
Atlanta, Brutal Bitter is vintage Maier: hoppy, unfiltered, layered
with exotic malts, and in a stylistic category all its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to do a kind of Imperial Bitter,'' he says. He knows
there's no such thing, and laughs. He only means the equivalent in
a bitter to an Imperial Stout _ a beer at the apex of its style.
What resulted is one with the dryness and subtle maltiness of a
bitter, but also the hoppiness of an India Pale Ale. And yet you
wouldn't call it an IPA, and neither would you call it an Extra
Special Bitter. It's another Maier original, pleasingly bitter but
not really brutal ... not brutal enough, a fan might plead.
</P>
<P>
   From start to finish, Maier uses a single hop, an unusual
approach among craft brewers. But the Crystal hop, Maier says, is a
triploid, developed from the Hallertau, Cascade and Brewers Gold
varieties. The result is an ale with the citrusy character of the
Cascade but also the earthy, slightly spicy quality of the
Hallertau.
</P>
<P>
   The barley, imported from Britain, was malted on the floor in
the old-fashioned way, with a maltster raking over it continuously.
A pinch of wheat from France is added to the grist. And that Pacman
yeast, whatever it really is, imparts an estery fruitiness that's
disarming in a beer whose name tells you to brace yourself.

GETTING GRAPHIC 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like most journalists, I'm irresistibly drawn to tales of
conflict. I reveled in the browser wars between Microsoft Corp. and
Netscape Communications Corp. I thrill to Advanced Micro Devices
Inc.'s desperate campaign to seize a share of the microprocessor
market from mighty Intel Corp.
</P>
<P>
   But for sheer blood-on-the-wallpaper viciousness, it's hard to
top the competition in 3D graphic accelerators _ the chips that let
fans of computer games like Quake slaughter one another with
maximum realism.
</P>
<P>
   Good computer 3D used to cost tens of thousands of dollars.
Today it's so cheap any home PC owner can afford it, and it's
getting cheaper and better by the month. Unlike the processor chip
market, where everybody waits for the next new idea from Intel,
there are a host of firms all trying different techniques to serve
up better graphics at lower cost. The result is a market that
resembles an old ``Mad Max'' movie. It's an apocalyptic struggle of
all against all, where even the product names radiate an aura of
menace.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, a firm called Cirrus Logic Inc.
practically owned the market with its ViRGE chips. Today, the
company barely has a pulse. S3 Inc. dominated for a while, then
cratered last year when the public rejected the company's Savage 3D
products. Up came ATI Technologies Inc. of Canada, with its Rage
accelerators. But ATI's reign is now imperiled by 3Dfx Interactive
Inc., whose Voodoo 3 products are presently number one at retail
stores. And S3, once given up for dead, is launching a massive
counterattack with its new Savage 4 chip, which is getting good
early reviews.
</P>
<P>
   The winners in this fearsome struggle are those who do the best
job of deceiving the rest of us. Graphic accelerators draw images
on a flat, two-dimensional computer screen that appear to have the
three-dimensional depth of the real world.
</P>
<P>
   Any sketch artist can trick your eye by drawing two-dimensional
objects that seem to have depth. A computer can do the same. But
what if you want to create the illusion of 3D images that move?
Your problem suddenly becomes a few million times more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Just move your own head and you'll see why. The relative
position of everything in the room changes, because your point of
view has changed. The only way a computer can emulate this effect
is by recalculating the position of every single dot of light on
the screen, using extremely complex math equations to make it all
look right.
</P>
<P>
   It gets far, far worse if you want the objects to move quickly
and smoothly, because then the computer must make all of these
calculations almost instantly. As a Quake player runs down a
virtual corridor, his computer must redraw every image on the
screen dozens of times a second, with no flicker, no delay.
</P>
<P>
   Desktop microprocessors couldn't begin to handle this kind of
load. So graphics firms make chips designed solely to do
three-dimensional math. They run at speeds once found only in Cray
supercomputers, yet graphics cards using these chips generally cost
well below $200.
</P>
<P>
   And as the leaders keep introducing newer and better chips, the
smaller players find it ever harder to keep up. A few years ago,
Number Nine Visual Technologies in Lexington seemed to be within
striking distance of the top-tier graphics players. Today, Number
Nine is only number 31 in market share, according to PC Data Inc.
</P>
<P>
   But the company hopes to pick up a few share points by basing
fewer products on its own accelerator chip and building more of
them around the Savage 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a smaller company, it's hard for us to come out with a
sustainable product,'' said general manager William Ralph.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent visit to Number Nine, I got a glimpse of the
company's Savage 4 board working its magic on Quake. The 3D images
had all the murky grimness anyone could want, with smooth,
realistic movement. The price seemed even more impressive _ $109
list.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, compared with the computer images in films like ``Toy
Story'' or the new ``Star Wars,'' the Savage 4 and its desktop
rivals are still at the Model T stage.
</P>
<P>
   So graphics chip makers continue their relentless campaign of
improvements, constantly leapfrogging their rivals with even better
performance. It's like one of those computer games where victory
simply means staying alive _ my favorite kind.

LOGGING ON TO THE LOVE-IN AT WOODSTOCK.COM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PATTI HARTIGAN   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Woodstock.com is more than just a Web site: It's a virtual
nation-state, complete with its own population of preachers and
politicians, leaders and latchers-on, hawkers and hooligans. And by
the time they get to Woodstock '99, these cybercitizens will be
connected in ways that the hippies who trudged to the legendary
festival in upstate New York 30 years ago could never have
imagined.
</P>
<P>
   The live concert, featuring more than three dozen bands and set
for July 23-26 at Griffiss Park in Rome, N.Y., is a still a month
away, but pilgrims whose starting points range from Methuen to
Milwaukee are already forging friendships, sparking romances, and
building miniature communities.
</P>
<P>
   It's the '90s equivalent of a love-in, and it's happening on
line.
</P>
<P>
   Folks are convening in the Woodstock.com chat room, dishing out
the usual ``What are you wearing?'' and ``Where are you from?''
inanities. They're carping about concert management and complaining
about Aerosmith cancelling. They're forming car pools and arranging
rendezvous. And they're organizing ``tent circles,'' a phenomenon
that belongs to the cyber generation.
</P>
<P>
   A tent circle is a community of like-minded people who meet on
line; at the concert campground, they will pitch their tents in a
circle. One group plans to mark its site with a Winnie-the-Pooh
flag; another group will display a giant Gumby doll. There's a tent
circle for sober celebrants and another congregation of people over
25; both groups have adopted rules to maintain sanity and safety.
``I want to go and have fun, but I don't want to hang around with a
bunch of 18-year-old puking idiots,'' says Lynne Taylor, 28, of
Methuen, who signed up with the Over-25 Road Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   One group calls itself the Milwaukee Party Swingers; another
crowd of Jim Morrison fans goes by the name the Lizard Kingdom. ``I
don't want to say the music takes a back seat, but it's all about
meeting people,'' says Chris Myden, 20, a Calgary native who
launched an on-line Woodstock registry where people can post their
photos and profiles.
</P>
<P>
   Few of these concertgoers wax nostalgic about peace, love, and
tie-dye or about music that aims to change the world. Most of them
weren't even born in 1969, the year of the first festival, and many
of them didn't attend the 25th anniversary extravaganza in 1994.
The only throwback to the '60s era comes from the Lizard Kingdom
folks, who describe their tent circle as a place ``where everyone
can experience and celebrate their soul, a place where you can be
your true self...free from the confines of reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Misty metaphysics aside, both the concert and its official Web
site are places where everyone, even the Lizard King, is a
potential consumer. On the Web site, you can buy your camping
equipment from a local hardware store, purchase a transportation
package, or buy T-shirts and other concert paraphernalia.
</P>
<P>
   No, McLachlan isn't appearing at Woodstock '99, and the ``live''
performance was recorded last year. The site is positioning itself
for a life after Woodstock, and the pay-per-view event is a way to
lure festival groupies to come back when the tents are folded up
and the concert is over.
</P>
<P>
   The times, they are 'a changing, and we're not talking about
music or politics. We're talking about the Internet. Back in 1994,
when the World Wide Web was dawning, there were a few sites and
bulletin boards devoted to Woodstock II. Today, they seem terribly
quaint, grainy text pages counting down to the event.
</P>
<P>
   But now everything on the Web is about commerce: Woodstock.com
is a thinly disguised launching pad for a music portal site that
will combine commerce, news, and entertainment. ``Think of it as an
environment full of rich content that people will enjoy,'' says
Rand Bleimeister, chief executive officer of Music now, which owns
Woodstock.com. In the near future, the site is going to start
offering free e-mail and free home pages, along with an on-line
radio station.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the site is incredibly popular with pilgrims seeking
companionship; Bleimeister says it gets about 20,000 hits a day.
But it's not without its detractors. One user who calls himself the
Minister of Edutainment says he doesn't care about ``songwriter
news or all the boring music stuff.'' The organizer of the over-25
group is boycotting the site's bulletin boards because they are
riddled with profanity and personal attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The nation state is already having its own little rebellion of
sorts, but for the most part, the site is embraced by its avid
population. The tent circle phenomenon is a first, a harbinger of
future festivals. But the members of this cyber community aren't
naive; they grew up on-line, and they know that cyber dreams are
easily burst. ``Everyone is beautiful in the virtual world,'' says
Steve Julius, organizer of the Milwaukee group, laughing. ``It
doesn't always work out that way in real life.'' Send that man to
the Lizard Kingdom circle, where he can be freed from the
``confines of reality.''

GOING ON-LINE FOR BACKUP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you have a home computer, the chances are excellent that you
don't back it up on a regular basis _ and there is a good chance
that you have never backed it up all.
</P>
<P>
   After all, backing up a home computer is hard work. Most PCs
these days are sold with hard drives that store from 2 to 6
gigabytes. Saving this information to floppies is impractical _ it
would take thousands. Instead, many people use a tape drive, but
they cost hundreds of dollars, and the tape cartridges typically
cost $30 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, if you don't do regular backups, you are courting danger.
Although computers are much more reliable than they were a few
years ago, hard drives still fail. Then there are the constant
risks of fire and theft. Backups also protect against data loss
caused by viruses, clumsy fingers, and children who needed to clean
off your financial records to make way for their computer games.
</P>
<P>
   Connected Online Backup is an innovative system that lets you
back up a huge hard drive without spending a huge fortune. The
system uses your existing Internet connection and a few clever
tricks to safely squirrel your data away at Connected's Backup
Center. You can even schedule the backups to happen automatically _
for example, every day at 3 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   If you later discover a file is missing, you can run Connected's
intuitive user interface, find the file in question, and restore it
to your computer's hard drive. The service costs $19.95 a month for
each computer you back up _ a price that buys you an unlimited
amount of storage space on the company's servers. Businesses can
buy in bulk: For example, if you want to back up 100 computers,
Connected charges $16.41 per month per machine.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Connected works best if you have a high-speed
Internet connection, such as a cable modem or a DSL line. Using my
high-speed cable modem, I backed up a 1.5-gigabyte hard drive in a
little less than two hours. (The same backup would have taken
between 15 and 30 hours over a dial-up connection.)
</P>
<P>
   One of the tricks Connected uses to make the backup go faster is
file comparison. When the program goes to back up your copy of
Microsoft Word, for example, if first checks to see if somebody
else has backed up the files that make up the Word application to
Connected's backup servers. If somebody has, the program doesn't
bother uploading the same file a second time.
</P>
<P>
   This generates huge savings for most users. After all, there is
no reason to back up 10,000 identical copies of the same file from
10,000 individual computers, when one copy that is properly indexed
and archived will work just as well.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Connected can't use this data reduction trick when it is
restoring the files to your computer after a crash. Restoring my
hard drive over my high-speed cable modem took 12 hours _ over a
dial-up connection, it would have taken more than a hundred.
Connected knows this is a problem. So instead of downloading the
files over the Internet, you can also elect to have the company
burn your files into a write-once CD-ROM and have Connected send
the disks to you by UPS or FedEx. The cost is $24.95, plus
shipping.
</P>
<P>
   My biggest concern when I first learned of Connected Online
Backup was security: There are many secrets stored on my hard
drive. What assurances did I have that the information, once sent
to Connected, would stay secure?
</P>
<P>
   Connected's answer to the security problem is encryption. Before
your files are sent over the Internet, they are scrambled using an
encryption key that you specify. The files remain scrambled at
Connected's data center. If you want to get your files back, you
need to know the key you used. (You can also choose to have
Connected escrow a copy of your key, just in case you are the
forgetful type.) Connected's encryption protects against attackers
on the Internet, who might monitor your files as they travel over
the public network. The encryption also protects against the
possibility of crooked employees at Connected.
</P>
<P>
   But while Connected's encryption is good, it has problems. In my
tests, I discovered that while the contents of the files sent over
the Internet are encrypted, the file names are not. This is a
serious failing, since file names frequently contain confidential
information _ for example, the names of clients. Somebody watching
your Internet connection as your back up your computer can find out
very quickly what you are working on. Such monitoring can be easily
done by a person at your upstream ISP or, in some cases, somebody
on your cable modem network.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked Connected about my finding, the company's first
reaction was to dismiss it, saying the confidential information in
file names isn't that significant. Perhaps so, but Connected is
advertising its backup as providing ``absolute security.''
Connected is not delivering on this promise.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem with Connected Online Backup is the restore
process itself. Connected's disk ``repair'' software is quite
sophisticated. If your computer stops working after you install a
new program, you can use Connected to roll the computer back to the
way it was before the application was installed. Alternatively, you
can reformat your computer's hard drive (or buy a new one) and
restore the backup from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Connected makes the ``repair'' facility available
only to businesses that use the service for at least 50 computers.
``Repair'' isn't made available to small businesses or individuals
because Connected is worried about the cost of providing technical
support to these users. I think this attitude is cruel and callous
_ it is these small users that need services such as Connected's
repair facility the most.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming years, remote backup systems including Connected
are likely to be very popular, as they provide reliable, off-site
backup at an affordable cost. But Connected's current system needs
to mature a bit before I can give it my wholehearted endorsement.

SEC INVESTIGATING HOW MICROSOFT CLASSIFIES ITS RESERVE REVENUES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAN RICHMAN   
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A federal agency is investigating whether Microsoft
has been setting aside revenues in flush quarters to shore up
earnings reports in lean quarters, the Redmond company's chief
financial officer disclosed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At a hastily called news conference, Greg Maffei said the
investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission began
several months ago.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the SEC would neither confirm nor deny that an
investigation is under way.
</P>
<P>
   Maffei speculated that the investigation was triggered by a Jan.
14 story in The Wall Street Journal. That story related allegations
by Charles Pancerzewski, a former Microsoft internal auditor.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Journal story, Pancerzewski charged in a 1997
wrongful-discharge suit that Microsoft manipulated revenue reserves
totaling hundreds of millions of dollars to make its profits appear
more stable.
</P>
<P>
   The story says the suit alleges Microsoft put aside revenue in
healthy quarters to cover costs like future product returns and
promotional rebates, and added them back in during leaner quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Pancerzewski was traveling Wednesday and could not be reached.
His lawyer, Pete Vial, said Pancerzewski had been in Washington,
D.C., but said he could not confirm whether his client had spoken
with the SEC because of a confidentiality agreement in the
settlement of his lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our understanding is (the investigation is) related to
reserves and reserve policies,'' Maffei said Wednesday. ``Reviewing
the financial records of every company is certainly within the
SEC's practice. I wouldn't claim to know how common investigations
or inquiries into reserves and reserves policies are.''
</P>
<P>
   A company spokesman said this is the first time the SEC has
investigated Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of reserves is to reflect a company's true revenues
_ how much it will actually end up collecting in a given period if
customers return merchandise or fail to pay their bills.
</P>
<P>
   But these accounting practices do ``open up the door to earnings
management, if not done right,'' said Jack Ciesielski, who writes
the Analyst's Accounting Observer, a Baltimore newsletter on
accounting.
</P>
<P>
   In Microsoft's case, the company may have reserved too much,
which would mean that it may have understated its actual profits.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has set aside about $4 billion in what it calls
``unearned revenues'' as a result of the way it sells both its
Windows operating system products and its Office suite of software
applications.
</P>
<P>
   Maffei said he didn't know how long the investigation would last
and declined to provide further details. He said he believes the
investigation will have no material effect on Microsoft's business
or financial condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very happy with the current pace of business,'' he told
the conference call of analysts and reporters. ``I'm comfortable
that we're at least going to make analysts' estimates.''
</P>
<P>
   William Epifanio, an analyst at J.P. Morgan Securities, agreed.
``I'm not too worried about it yet,'' he said. ``They have a good
reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft stock closed Wednesday at $90.19, up $2.19.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC has been aiming to eliminate corporate manipulation of
earnings at least since last fall. In November 1998, the SEC's
chief accountant, Lynn Turner, told an accounting industry group
that the agency's division of corporation finance had formed an
earnings-management task force to coordinate and focus the SEC's
filing reviews on abusive reporting practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The division of enforcement has also stepped up their focus on
earnings management,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   One financial analyst expressed surprise upon hearing of the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft has been extremely conservative in its earnings
estimates _ based on what I know about them, it's hard to
believe,'' said Greg Bailes, an audit partner with
PricewaterhouseCoopers in Seattle. ``Anything done to smooth
earnings is not only unacceptable to the SEC but isn't even within
generally accepted accounting principles.''
</P>
<P>
   During Wednesday's news conference, Maffei disclosed the SEC
investigation after a lengthy recital of two changes being made to
accounting procedures at Microsoft. He denied the changes are
related to the SEC investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In one of those changes, Microsoft will reclassify how it
reports revenues and costs for four items: product support,
consulting services, training and certification of system
integrators, and fees for accessing the MSN Web site. Henceforth,
the customer receipts will be dealt with as revenue, and costs that
vary directly with revenue will be classified as cost of revenues.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the costs of the first three items were reported as
sales and marketing activities, and customer receipts were reported
as cost recoveries.
</P>
<P>
   The reclassification causes revenue to be 5.1 percent higher for
fiscal 1997, 5.4 percent higher for fiscal 1998, and 5.8 percent
higher for fiscal 1999 year to date than it would have been under
the prior model. Revenue from each of the four areas ranges from
$150 million to $300 million annually. In total, revenue for the
first three quarters of fiscal 1999 will be about $761 million
higher because of the reclassification, Maffei said.
</P>
<P>
   The second procedural change relates to accounting for unearned
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   To comply with a recent change in accounting rules, Maffei said
Microsoft will change the initial earned and unearned revenue
percentages and the timing of revenue recognition for its Windows
operating system software and Office productivity suite.
</P>
<P>
   These changes, both of which have been reviewed by the SEC,
together will create 1 cent of additional revenue during the
current quarter and the same additional amount in fiscal 2000,
Maffei said.
</P>
<P>

Bloomberg News.

TO INSTALL OR NOT TO INSTALL, THAT IS THE QUESTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY   
 c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Give it to me straight. Should I install the
Windows 98 CD that Microsoft sent me for free last July, or is
there something new out there that debugs the old stuff? Windows 95
suits my needs just fine, but you know the feeling you get when
there is an uninstalled disk sitting in your drawers!
</P>
<P>
   _Happy With 95
</P>
<P>
   DEAR HAPPY: Where I keep my disks is none of your business.
Sometimes I just like to warm them up before using them. There's
nothing wrong with that. I just have to remember to keep from
sitting down.
</P>
<P>
   I'm guessing that the ``free'' Win98 CD actually came by way of
your computer maker, since Microsoft isn't exactly in the habit of
giving away free upgrades, as you Office 2000 upgraders are finding
out. It's pretty common practice, though, for manufacturers to cut
a deal with the Big Evil Corporation when a new version of
something is close to being ready so their customers can have the
latest and greatest.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, if you're happy with 95, just leave things the way they
are. Win98 is definitely an improvement _ thousands of bugs have
been fixed and several new features and utilities have been added _
but until Bill Gates figures out a way to put a gun to your head
and force you into it, you really don't have to upgrade, although I
understand that Microsoft Armbreaker 2000 is almost ready for
release.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I'm going to give you a chance to do something
for all your readers that, as far as I know, you've never done
before _ give us some actual, useful, usable information. How can I
upgrade my Windows 98 program using the Microsoft Web site?
</P>
<P>
   _Intermediate User
</P>
<P>
   DEAR INTER: Nice attitude. This is just a wild guess, but maybe
you should try following the instructions that are clearly
displayed when you click on Windows Update in the Start menu.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it feels like you're letting Big Bill rummage around
your underwear drawer, the updater is one of the nicest features
about Win98. It connects you to the Microsoft Web site, then sends
you a program that will poke around your system to see what version
of everything you have. Don't worry, you can tell it not to. Based
on what it finds, it recommends a number of updates. You pick what
you want, the download starts and you sit back with a cold one. The
downloaded stuff even installs itself.
</P>
<P>
   If you've never updated 98 at all, maybe you should consider
getting all the fixes at once by going to
www.microsoft.com/windows98/ and sending Bill 20 bucks for the
Windows 98 Second Edition upgrade. I hear he really needs the
money. He's down to his last $91 billion.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I am a college student who will graduate from
Syracuse University in August. My idea is to open an online store
that allows people to purchase personal items (birth-control
devices, feminine-hygiene products, diet pills, adult diapers) from
the privacy of home. Please send me advice.
</P>
<P>

SLOW UPDATES ON NOTEBOOK MAY MEAN YOU BOUGHT A `PASSIVE-MATRIX'
DISPLAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DWIGHT SILVERMAN   
 c.1999 Houston Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I recently bought a notebook computer _ a Toshiba Satellite
4525 CDS. I am not happy with the way the screen updates.
Everything is very slow. Also, whenever the system has been idle
for a while, a Toshiba ad comes up as a screen saver. What can I do
to speed things up?
</P>
<P>
   A: In general, the displays on most notebook computers _ and
particularly ``value'' models, such as that one _ are not going to
be as peppy as those on desktops. Some displays are faster than
others, however.
</P>
<P>
   You didn't say whether the notebook you bought has an
active-matrix or passive-matrix (sometimes called a dual-scan)
display. However, from your description, I suspect it's
passive-matrix, and that may be your problem.
</P>
<P>
   Passive-matrix displays are, by nature, quite slow and are not
as bright as active-matrix screens. For example, if you try to play
a fast-paced game on a passive-matrix system, you'll see a lot of
ghosting and blurry images as the screen tries to keep up. With a
quality active-matrix display, the screen is virtually as speedy as
a traditional desktop monitor.
</P>
<P>
   With an active-matrix screen, each pixel on the display has its
own transistor controlling it. On a passive-matrix screen, one
transistor may control many pixels. Thus, the graphics are not as
nimble. I generally recommend that users avoid passive-matrix
portables _ though they are likely to be much less expensive. The
active-matrix version of the 2545 is $500 more than the
passive-matrix model, according to Toshiba's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   If, however, you have the active-matrix model, you can try
turning off all the background programs _ virus checkers, etc._ and
reduce the number of colors in the display to 256. (Right-click on
the open desktop, choose Properties, then Settings. Click the
colors drop-down box to change it to 256.) While this won't look as
good as having high or true color, it will speed up your display.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When I boot my PC up, at the end I get the following message:
CSUSEM32 has performed an illegal task. I then click OK and nothing
seems different about my computer. What is CSUSEM32?
</P>
<P>
   A: This file is part of CleanSweep, the utility from Symantec
(previously from Quarterdeck) that lets you remove programs and
clutter from your hard drive. The file is part of a component
called the Usage Monitor that tracks to see how often you use
programs. It uses the information to recommend seldom-used programs
you might be able to remove from your drive to gain space.
</P>
<P>
   It runs in the background (along with another component of
CleanSweep that watches for software installations), and if you
read these pages regularly, you know how I feel about background
programs _ they are more trouble than they are worth. My
recommendation would be to turn this off. There should be a setting
to do so in CleanSweep's preferences. Or, if it places an icon in
the Startup folder, remove it from there.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, you can usually determine what program a component
like this belongs to by doing a search for it with the Windows Find
feature (right-click on the drive in My Computer, choose Find). The
folder that holds it should give you a clue as to the parent
program.

HERE'S WHY TO HAVE EUDORA LOVE AFFAIR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DWIGHT SILVERMAN   
 c.1999 Houston Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ask any techno-pundit to name the ``killer app'' for the
Internet, and you're likely to get one of two answers _ e-mail or
the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   You can put me in the first camp. While e-mail may not be as
sexy as the Web, it's the most-used _ and the most useful _
application. For most folks, it's the one thing that makes them
understand the importance of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic mail is responsible for bringing distant families
together, speeding negotiations, even running whole businesses. It
has completely changed our expectations of how quickly people
communicate with each other. The U.S. Postal Service earned the
derisive nickname of ``snail mail'' because e-mail is just so
darned fast.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most popular e-mail programs is Eudora. One of the
first e-mail programs available for Macintosh and then Windows
Internet users, it was initially free. Qualcomm, best known for
communications equipment and cellular phones, develops it, and it's
definitely a sideline.
</P>
<P>
   While there's still a free version, known as Eudora Lite, it's
the commercial version, Eudora Pro, that is the star.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
OTHERS PALE TO EUDORA
</P>
<P>
   I've been a serious Eudora user since I first got on the
Internet in 1992. I've tried every other e-mail application that's
come along since, including Netscape's Messenger; Microsoft's
Exchange, Outlook Express and Outlook; America Online's e-mail
component; even Pegasus, the other top free mail software program.
None of them comes close.
</P>
<P>
   The latest version of Eudora Pro, 4.2, is the best yet. It's an
update to the version you're most apt to find on store shelves,
which is 4.1, for about $39. But its new features are so compelling
and so well done that this is more than just a minor upgrade. It
puts Eudora Pro in a class by itself.
</P>
<P>
   However, let me add a caveat. I would not recommend Eudora Pro
4.2 for everyone. It has a fairly complex set of features, and the
interface can seem cluttered to some. If you like your e-mail
software simple, you probably don't need this.
</P>
<P>
   But if you are a relatively sophisticated e-mail user _ perhaps
one who is overwhelmed by e-mail volume, or who has multiple e-mail
accounts _ then Eudora Pro can make life much easier.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it does all the things you'd expect a modern-day
e-mail program to do _ displays HTML-based and Rich Text Format
e-mail messages; includes a comprehensive address book; works with
either POP3 or IMAP e-mail servers; includes a spell-checker; and
will launch a browser when you click on a Web address in an e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
EUDORA COMPLETES THOUGHTS
</P>
<P>
   Among the new features in 4.2 is auto-complete, which will
attempt to finish an e-mail address as you type it. It gets this
information from recently entered e-mail addresses. If Eudora
thinks the address being entered is similar to several different
ones, it offers a drop-down box list to let you choose.
</P>
<P>
   Automatic spell-checking also has been added. As you type,
misspelled words are underlined in red. If you want to add special
words _ such as names or unusual spellings _ to the dictionary,
Windows users can right-click and choose Add from the menu that
appears. (Macintosh users would click-and-hold with their
inadequate, one-button mice!)
</P>
<P>
   Qualcomm also has beefed up the search functions in Eudora Pro.
You can now perform complex searches using Boolean terms, a type of
standard search language. If you use your e-mail folders like I do
_ as a kind of database for information you've received from others
_ this feature makes it much easier to find that needle in the
haystack.
</P>
<P>
   Eudora has always had one of the best systems for filtering
e-mail into folders as it comes into your system. This can be used
to pre-organize information or to banish junk e-mail. But fans of
filters know there's a problem _ sometimes you forget to look in
those folders to see what's new.
</P>
<P>
   Eudora Pro 4.2 solves this with a unique solution that turns
text into speech. You can turn on a feature that will let the
computer read aloud the subject lines of e-mail being filtered into
specific folders. This can get annoying if you turn this on for a
folder that receives a lot of mail _ if you filter spam, you
wouldn't put this on your trash folder, for example _ so it's best
used for mail that's very important.
</P>
<P>
   Eudora Pro also is the best e-mail software for managing
multiple accounts. Using a drop-down box available in the From:
field in the composition window, you can change the identity of the
sender. For example, you can pull in an e-mail from an account at
work and answer it via a personal account.
</P>
<P>
   If you already own Eudora Pro 4.0 or later for Windows or
Macintosh, you can upgrade for free to 4.2 by downloading an
updater at www.eudora.com. There's also a demo version of Eudora
Pro 4.1 at that same address, if you want to check out the look and
feel of the program.

LEARNING CHESS WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM BORIS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LONNIE BROWN   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the past several months, Boris and I have met frequently so
he could impart his knowledge of chess to me.
</P>
<P>
   Boris is as good a name as any for a chess-playing computer who
speaks in mostly clear, but measured, computer speech. I decided to
call him that because it's more personal than his formal title:
Chess Academy from Saitek Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Boris will take the beginning player, teach him about each
piece, its relative value, how it moves and captures, and how it is
governed by the rules of chess. He will then take the
more-knowledgeable beginner by the hand to the opening game,
indicating which pieces to move through light-emitting diodes on
each of the chessboard's 64 squares.
</P>
<P>
   He'll lead players down the right path, then have players back
the pieces up to show what could have happened should they have
moved to the wrong squares or attacked with the wrong piece.
</P>
<P>
   He's a lightweight to carry (about three pounds of board,
computer brain and playing pieces, which are stored in a
compartment underneath the board), but a heavyweight to play _
estimated rating of about 2000 at 40 moves in two hours.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 rating means that he plays around the expert-master
level. The rating of the average United States Chess Federation
tournament player is about 1450.
</P>
<P>
   Boris, however, has 100 playing levels, including 60
fun/handicap levels that give beginners and intermediate players a
crack at winning a game every once in a while. In addition, there
are 10 casual levels, 10 tournament levels, 10 blitz levels, one
tactical and one infinite level and eight levels for solving setups
where mate is unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   The board measures 8-by-8 inches; the entire machine measures
16-by-11 inches and is about two inches thick. The pieces are
silver and black; the king is two inches high. The playing surface
is pressure sensitive, and moved pieces are shown both by LEDs on
the board and by a LCD display to the right of the board. The
machine draws power either from an adapter or six C-size batteries.
</P>
<P>
   The big selling point about Chess Academy (a.k.a. ``Boris'') is
that it not only instructs beginning and intermediate chess, but it
talks as well _ and it talks a lot. There are 10 basic learning
categories, with 10 lessons in each category.
</P>
<P>
   Players can go through the lessons at their own pace, but they
take a minimum of about eight or 10 minutes each to move through.
So that works out to be a minimum of 13-plus hours of audio
instructions in a chess computer.
</P>
<P>
   Chess Academy isn't the cheapest dedicated chess-playing
computer around. You can find them for as little as $25, and they
play better than the average tournament player. Chess computers
that play at the 2200 level cost a bit more _ about $60 to $80 is
an entry-price range. The lowest retail price I've found for Chess
Academy is $157.50 (www.icdchess.com).
</P>
<P>
   For 13 hours or more of chess instruction, the price works out
to be about $12 an hour for chess instruction _ and that doesn't
take into account that there's a strong chess opponent left over
long after the instructions are finished. From that standpoint, the
price appears in the ballpark for a dedicated chess computer for
the casual home player.
</P>
<P>
   Chess Academy's competition on the teaching side, of course,
comes from chess software. ChessMaster 6000 from Mindscape Inc.
offers instructions for beginners, top-ranked play, and even voice
commentaries on games played against the computer. The software
costs about $30 to $45.
</P>
<P>
   Add $600 or more to that price if you don't have a computer
system on which to run the software. In addition, chess software
ties up the system, while a dedicated chess machine doesn't.
Players who learn on a computer screen's two-dimensional board
sometimes discover it's a different game when played in a 3-D
setting, too.
</P>
<P>
   Another advantage for the self-contained chess game: It's
portable, not even needing an external power supply; travels
easily; and packs away out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   Lessons begin with the rules of moving pieces, explore openings,
end games, tactics, mating combinations and other aspects of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   After each topic, players can play the computer and put their
knowledge to work in a game. A ``chess coach'' can be called upon
to automatically point out careless or poor moves to beginners. And
when the computer is set on its easiest mode, even an inexperienced
pawn-shover can manage a victory. Nudging the computer's
intelligence level up a notch provides for a more challenging game,
and helps the beginner gain experience.
</P>
<P>
   Saitek also offers smaller chess computers at lower prices. And
the company has a good way of grouping computers for novice,
intermediate and experienced players. It's as simple as A, B, C.
</P>
<P>
   The Alpha series is for beginners. All the computers in the line
begin with ``A.'' The Benchmark series has the Bullet, Blade and
Barracuda for players who want a stronger game. And the Connoisseur
line has names beginning with ``C.'' The Chess Adademy is in that
grouping.

GETTING GRAPHIC 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like most journalists, I'm irresistibly drawn to tales of
conflict. I reveled in the browser wars between Microsoft Corp. and
Netscape Communications Corp. I thrill to Advanced Micro Devices
Inc.'s desperate campaign to seize a share of the microprocessor
market from mighty Intel Corp.
</P>
<P>
   But for sheer blood-on-the-wallpaper viciousness, it's hard to
top the competition in 3D graphic accelerators _ the chips that let
fans of computer games like Quake slaughter one another with
maximum realism.
</P>
<P>
   Good computer 3D used to cost tens of thousands of dollars.
Today it's so cheap any home PC owner can afford it, and it's
getting cheaper and better by the month. Unlike the processor chip
market, where everybody waits for the next new idea from Intel,
there are a host of firms all trying different techniques to serve
up better graphics at lower cost. The result is a market that
resembles an old ``Mad Max'' movie. It's an apocalyptic struggle of
all against all, where even the product names radiate an aura of
menace.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, a firm called Cirrus Logic Inc.
practically owned the market. Today, the company barely has a
pulse.S3 Inc. dominated for a while, then cratered last year when
the public rejected the company's Savage 3D products. Up came ATI
Technologies Inc. of Canada, with its Rage accelerators. But ATI's
reign is now imperiled by 3Dfx Interactive Inc., whose Voodoo 3
products are presently number one at retail stores. And S3, once
given up for dead, is launching a massive counterattack with its
new Savage 4 chip, which is getting good early reviews.
</P>
<P>
   The winners in this fearsome struggle are those who do the best
job of deceiving the rest of us. Graphic accelerators draw images
on a flat, two-dimensional computer screen that appear to have the
three-dimensional depth of the real world.
</P>
<P>
   Any sketch artist can trick your eye by drawing two-dimensional
objects that seem to have depth. A computer can do the same. But
what if you want to create the illusion of 3D images that move?
Your problem suddenly becomes a few million times more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Just move your own head and you'll see why. The relative
position of everything in the room changes, because your point of
view has changed. The only way a computer can emulate this effect
is by recalculating the position of every single dot of light on
the screen, using extremely complex math equations to make it all
look right.
</P>
<P>
   It gets far, far worse if you want the objects to move quickly
and smoothly, because then the computer must make all of these
calculations almost instantly. As a Quake player runs down a
virtual corridor, his computer must redraw every image on the
screen dozens of times a second, with no flicker, no delay.
</P>
<P>
   Desktop microprocessors couldn't begin to handle this kind of
load. So graphics firms make chips designed solely to do
three-dimensional math. They run at speeds once found only in Cray
supercomputers, yet graphics cards using these chips generally cost
well below $200.
</P>
<P>
   And as the leaders keep introducing newer and better chips, the
smaller players find it ever harder to keep up. A few years ago,
Number Nine Visual Technologies in Lexington seemed to be within
striking distance of the top-tier graphics players. Today, Number
Nine is only number 31 in market share, according to PC Data Inc.
</P>
<P>
   But the company hopes to pick up a few share points by basing
fewer products on its own accelerator chip and building more of
them around the Savage 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a smaller company, it's hard for us to come out with a
sustainable product,'' said general manager William Ralph.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent visit to Number Nine, I got a glimpse of the
company's Savage 4 board working its magic on Quake. The 3D images
had all the murky grimness anyone could want, with smooth,
realistic movement. The price seemed even more impressive _ $109
list.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, compared with the computer images in films like ``Toy
Story'' or the new ``Star Wars,'' the Savage 4 and its desktop
rivals are still at the Model T stage.
</P>
<P>
   So graphics chip makers continue their relentless campaign of
improvements, constantly leapfrogging their rivals with even better
performance. It's like one of those computer games where victory
simply means staying alive _ my favorite kind.

AFTER SKIMMING THE MANUAL, SETTLE DOWN WITH THE BOOK  
 FCC OFFICIALS SAY MERGER ISN'T A DONE DEAL  
 A GOOD NERD THESE DAYS MUST BE ABLE TO STREAM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   With each new generation of software, user manuals get skimpier
in inverse proportion to the addition of new features. The user
manual for MS-DOS in 1982, for example, was 486 dense pages; the
manual for Windows 95, with tens of thousands more features, was a
stingy 95 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Software companies insist that they now produce programs so
intuitive that manuals are unnecessary, and that besides, built-in
help systems are far more useful.
</P>
<P>
   But sales of aftermarket computer books say consumers think
otherwise. In fact, Microsoft Office 2000, the recent upgrade of
the world's best-selling suite of business software, is turning out
to be the 1999 Full Employment Act for writers, editors and
publishers of computer books.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Bennett, president of MacMillan Publishing USA, says his
company has 56 titles dedicated to Office 2000 _ 14 percent of all
its titles this year. IDG Books, best known for its ``... for
Dummies'' series, is also unleashing a torrent of Office 2000
books. The lure for both companies is the estimated $1.1 billion
consumers will spend on technical books this year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, tying a book's fortunes to software sales can be risky.
``Windows 98 met with a resounding ho-hum,'' Bennett noted.

   Two FCC Officials Say Merger Isn't a Done Deal
</P>
<P>
   The media coverage of last week's merger-approval deal between
the staff of the Federal Communications Commission and SBC
Communications Inc., which is trying to acquire Ameritech Corp.,
rubbed at least a couple of the five commissioners the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   Though at least some news organizations, including The New York
Times, said the agreement meant that SBC had cleared a big hurdle
in winning approval for the merger, two of the commissioners said,
in effect, ``Not so fast.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Contrary to the suggestion of some press accounts, neither we
nor the full commission has indicated even tentative approval of
the SBC-Ameritech transaction or conditions,'' Commissioner Gloria
Tristani, a Democrat, and Commissioner Harold Furchtgott-Roth, a
Republican, said in a statement on Wednesday. ``Indeed, to do so
before the record has even closed would be improper.''
</P>
<P>
   According to people close to the commission, the deal was
negotiated by the agency's staff under the supervision of the FCC's
chairman, William Kennard, and Ms. Tristani and Furchtgott-Roth
were apparently upset by the assumption that the other four
commissioners would simply rubber-stamp the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   That said, few people in Washington expect the deal to get voted
down after the commission hears public comments on the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tristani is considered a strong supporter of Kennard, while
Furchtgott-Roth is often at odds with the chairman. But people
close to the commission said that Ms. Tristani and Furchtgott-Roth
often join forces on procedural matters.

   A Good Nerd These Days Must Be Able to Stream
</P>
<P>
   A generation ago, they might have been the budding engineers who
built model rockets or maintained the high school's lone film
projector as screwdriver-carrying members of the AV Club. A decade
ago they would have been the geeks setting up the school computer
lab.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, the tekkie nerds have gone online and multimedia
_ at least judging from three Dearborn (Mich.) High School students
who were in New York last week. The young men attended the
Streaming Media convention at the Sheraton New York, where they
demonstrated last term's project from their advanced video
production course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get the kids who are the weirdos,'' their avuncular,
68-year-old teacher, Russ Gibb, said approvingly as three of his
students demonstrated a wearable computer with a Webcam that they
and others in Gibb's class built for $5,500.
</P>
<P>
   Besides functioning as a standard personal computer, the system
contains a wireless transmitter that can send streams of video and
audio data to a Web-server computer. When worn in the halls and
classrooms of Dearborn High, the unit can transmit everything the
wearer hears and sees to the school's Web site
(www.dearbornschools.org/wdhs) _ potentially useful for letting a
sick schoolmate monitor a class from a home computer, for example.
</P>
<P>
   The computer runs the Linux operating system favored by the
technically adept of all ages who wish to make an anti-Microsoft
statement. But the machine also runs Microsoft Windows 95. That's
because most multimedia software is designed to work with Windows,
explained one of the students, Brandon Gheen, whose business card
lists his title as Student Computer Engineer.
</P>
<P>
   One of his card recipients at the conference was Anthony Bray,
general manager of Microsoft's Streaming Media Division, who said
he was impressed with the students' project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Audio, video and animation are the second wave of Internet
technology,'' Bray said. ``I expect that a large percentage of
innovative new content, services and applications will come from
young entrepreneurs, and these three kids give us a glimpse of that
future.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Gheen pronounced Bray ``cool.'' But he and his
fellow students, Patrick Murray and Alex Fisher, subsequently
critiqued what they see as the shortcoming of Microsoft's own
multimedia strategy _ with a specificity and technical vocabulary
too abstruse for a model-rocket-era reporter to process in a single
stream.
</P>
<P>
   Had they shared these opinions with the Microsoft executive?
``There's a time and a place for everything,'' Fisher said, wise
beyond his 18 years.

DIGITAL COMMERCE: IMPROVING DIALOGUE ON THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thanks to the Internet, as some very wise person has noted, we
have at least disproved the old saw about a thousand monkeys at a
thousand keyboards eventually producing a Shakespeare play.
</P>
<P>
   And all the millions of nodes in all the broadband,
packet-switched, fully synchronous networks in the world apparently
cannot prevent people from exchanges that are the digital
equivalent of ``Your mother wears Army boots.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet snobs may be inclined to dismiss the inanity of most
public conversations on the Web as irrelevant in their larger, more
commercial vision of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But others, noting a seemingly insatiable appetite for public
messaging, argue that the future of even the commercial Internet
depends on making this crucial component more satisfying for
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   To move people beyond the graffiti-esque quality of much online
messaging, they are developing software and discussion practices
that encourage computer users to talk to, rather than at, each
other. One of the most innovative ideas for creating value and
relevance in online conversation is coming from the world of
documentary film.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Weiss is a longtime independent filmmaker and past producer
of the highly regarded PBS television series ``P.O.V.,'' which
addresses controversial topics in American culture _ abortion,
Vietnam, death and dying, gay life, ageism, school prayer _ by
allowing people to tell their own stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``P.O.V.,'' an acronym for ``point of view,'' started online
salons to encourage postprogram conversation. One particularly
remarkable response _ to a program on the Vietnam War Memorial _
drove home for Weiss the potential of the medium.
</P>
<P>
   The theme for the Vietnam discussion sprang from Weiss'
realization that his ``whole life had been changed'' by the values
he learned in the anti-war movement of the 1960s and early '70s.
Whether people were for or against the war, had gone to Vietnam,
stayed home or come to America as refugees, he said, ``I realized
that there was a whole generation who had never reflected on how
their lives since the war had changed.''
</P>
<P>
   This theme _ notably sidestepping the polar arguments of the
last 25-plus years _ drew thousands to the site, creating 225
topics for discussion, each with 300 or 400 messages. ``We had vets
who said they learned more in that forum than they had in 25 years
at the veterans' hall,'' Weiss said.
</P>
<P>
   He says the success of the Vietnam forum inspired him to create
a nonprofit organization, Web Lab (www.weblab.org), that is
developing new models for online media and sponsoring projects that
bring ``fresh perspectives and new voices'' to the discussion of
public issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Web Lab software now under development will allow the
creation of highly structured online dialogue, using standard
bulletin-board technologies and features. But though the basic
technologies are standard, Web Lab's enhancements are not.
</P>
<P>
   For example, people interested in joining a Web Lab discussion
group must first complete a detailed registration form. The
software gathers these registration forms and sorts them by
categories, and when all the slots in a forum are filled, it spits
out an e-mail message to inform people that their group is ready to
go.
</P>
<P>
   Each group is limited to 60 or 70 people _ only about a third of
whom typically post messages _ to keep the conversation manageable.
But once the groups have started, Weiss and his team stay out of
the way, letting the group manage itself. ``Our function is
monitoring, not moderating,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Web Lab will produce the online discussion for
PBS' ``American Love Story,'' a five-episode ``P.O.V.'' program
about an interracial marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss says Web Lab is already gathering people's stories on the
Web Lab site. And although he acknowledges that the discussion will
obviously include racial issues, Weiss says the theme _ again,
sidestepping the usual polarity of conversations about race _ is a
more universal question: ``How do couples negotiate their
differences?''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiating differences is the key to online discussions and to
relationships, says Benjamin Barber, director of the Walt Whitman
Center for the Culture and Politics of Democracy at Rutgers
University.
</P>
<P>
   Barber, in conjunction with the Yale University Information
Society Project, has started Civic Exchange: Strong Democracy in
Cyberspace, a project based in part on the theories he developed in
his book on participatory democracy, ``Strong Democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Financed by the Markle Foundation, Civic Exchange
(www.law.yale.edu/infosociety) is building an online environment
designed to reinvigorate the ideals of thoughtful democratic
discourse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to address the dilemma that technology moves
people too fast,'' Barber says. ``It's an impediment to democracy,
which should be slow and deliberative. So we're trying to install
speed bumps on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   He says the same kind of paradox exists for the Internet that
has always existed in the practice of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``On one hand, democracy is about doing it yourself, he said.
``But to turn self-interested, narcissistic individuals into free
citizens takes education, acculturation and some sense of external
authority,'' to give them enough discipline to be responsible and
free.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Similarly, the Internet is designed to maximize speedy
do-it-yourself communication, without the intervention or hierarchy
of authority or even mediators.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what makes it appear more democratic,'' Barber said.
``But as we've seen, instead of knowledge, you get raw information.
Instead of informed opinion, you get private prejudice. Instead of
common ground, you get divisive private interests. So it isn't
democracy; it's anarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet any introduction of editors or monitors is perceived as
undemocratic. Barber and his Yale partner on the project, Beth
Noveck, hope to bridge that dichotomy by inventing a new genre of
online discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Their Civic Exchange software will require that participants
answer a few questions before they gain access to the discussion
area. And when participants are in the discussion site, there are
stringent rules. ``But,'' Barber said, ``with the participation of
the others in the group, you can remake the rules or modify them.''
</P>
<P>
   Unchangeable, though, is a rule imposed by the software itself:
The group must elect its own moderator. Barber says this single
feature alone may solve the dilemma of online anarchy vs. democracy
_ if not for the Internet writ large, at least for those seeking
meaningful dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the go-go culture of the Internet will slow down for
Civic Exchange's speed bumps is uncertain. But what drives the
group is the attempt to harness the network's strengths to people's
needs, instead of vice versa. ``It's about using the architecture
to your advantage, but not being victimized,'' Ms. Noveck says.
``At the very least, we shouldn't be bullied by it.''

NEWLY RELEASED GAMES PUT TO TEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ First, the Electronic Entertainment Expo swept
into Los Angeles in late spring with oodles of game stuff. Then, a
series of new games washed in for the summer. Here are breakdowns
on some of the recent releases: &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
PC
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Midtown Madness (Microsoft) _ Take a VW Beetle, a Caddie, a
city bus or other vehicles on a crazed run through downtown Chicago
in this somewhat offbeat racing title. Navigating a digital version
of the real Chicago streets is pretty cool (though I'd love to see
what they'd do with a  &UR; !ital! &LR; real driving town such as Los
Angeles). Online-only ``cops and robbers'' is one of five play
modes. Stoplights are for wimps.
</P>
<P>
   Yoot Tower (Sega PC) _ The terrific successor to SimTower comes
out on PC, after an initial release on the Mac. Build hotels,
resorts or office buildings, decide what mix of businesses to have,
and try to grow your business into a five-star destination. A
well-done, if Japan-centric, simulation.
</P>
<P>
   Milton Bradley Board Games and Parker Brothers Card Games
(Hasbro Interactive) _ Computer versions of Hasbro board games such
as Pente, Parcheesi, chess and checkers, and card games such as
Spades, Cribbage, Mille Bornes and Rook. The best aspect is
Internet play, a boon for slow-twitch game lovers who need a
partner to play Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Aliens Versus Predator (Fox Interactive) _ Fox took a couple of
its meanest movie killer species, and turned them into the basis
for a first-person shooter. Oh, and throw in a particularly nasty
colonial marine as your third option in this winner-survives-all
killfest. You'll need an accelerator card, however, to see all the
cool high-end graphics that have been packed into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Links Extreme (Microsoft) _ Who would have thought the Big Mouse
in Redmond has a sense of humor? They've taken the excellent Links
LS golfing game and transformed it into an entertaining
alternative, complete with exploding golf balls, deathmatch play
and monsters on the fairway. Tee this one up when you get kicked
out of the country club.
</P>
<P>
   Extreme Boards and Blades (Head Games) _ An extreme sports title
for skateboarders and in-line skaters. Decent graphics, fun ska
soundtrack, a fair variety of tricks.
</P>
<P>
   Extreme Rodeo (Head Games) _ If getting hurled off an angry
Brahma bull seemed fun but a tad unhealthy, try this title. Six
different events, 35 animals, force feedback and multiplayer
options. So-so graphics, but definitely different.
</P>
<P>
   Extreme Winter Sports (Head Games) _ Snowboard, ski and
skimobile over a variety of tracks. Decent gameplay, but given the
Web links to merchandise, more marketing than game.
</P>
<P>
   Machines (Acclaim) _ A 3-D strategy game based on a sci-fi
future where humans are gone, but their machines clank on, fighting
to control the galaxy. The 3-D views let you get much more
involved. Nice array of units, fun special weapons, and even room
for very non-machine-like subtleties such as espionage and
sabotage. Bad news: It requires a hardware accelerator.
</P>
<P>
   Puzzle Pack (Sega PC) - Sega pulls together three basic puzzle
games _ Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, Columns III and Lose Your
Marbles. Nothing fancy here, but this inexpensive title should
appeal to those who like to impose order on a chaotic universe. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
Mac or Mac/PC hybrid
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Railroad Tycoon II (Gathering of Developers) _ Build your own
railroad empire in this awesome simulator moved over to the Mac
after a best-selling run on the PC side. Really a wonderful game
that forces you to balance commercial considerations with
challenges such as train accidents, the Franco-Prussian War and
Jesse James robberies. Best of all, ``sandbox'' mode lets you build
to your heart's content. Beautiful and very cool.
</P>
<P>
   Imperialism II (SSI) _ Head one of eight colonial powers
beginning in 1500 and develop your resources and trade
relationships; explore, conquer and develop the New World; ally
with or fight other Great Powers and generally build an empire upon
which the sun never sets. Politically incorrect, but well done,
with excellent depth, good graphics and a nicely handled turn-based
approach.
</P>
<P>
   Sports Car GT (Electronic Arts) _ A terrific-looking racing sim,
with more than 50 cars, and the ability to download more. Eight
U.S. and European tracks, lots of customization and terrific
graphics. Mia, the Search for Grandma's Remedy (Kutoka Kids) _ A
truly gorgeous educational game for children ages 5 to 9 that
follows a winsome 3-D mouse on her quest through a house and its
yard to find medicine for her ailing granny. I was knocked out by
the graphics, and my children enjoyed the adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Freddi Fish 4: The Case of the Hogfish Rustlers of Briny Gulch
(Humongous Entertainment) _ Another terrific educational game for
children ages 3 to 8 from Humongous, who seems to do these things
pretty well. Freddi has to find the hogfish, and a great deal more,
in an adventure that also builds logic and puzzle-solving skills. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
Playstation
</P>
<P>
   &LR; 3Xtreme (989 Studios) _ Take your pick of in-line skating,
skateboarding or freestyle biking in this extreme sports racing
title, with a little bit of fighting as part of the gameplay. Fun
combat racing game, with bonuses for great tricks.
</P>
<P>
   Street Fighter Alpha 3 (Capcom) _ And the hits (and kicks) keep
coming. The market for fighting games seems inexhaustible, and this
one, chock-full of characters and combos from the durable Street
Fighter franchise, gives all the brawling choices you could want.
</P>
<P>
   Centipede (Atari/Hasbro Interactive) _ The latest classic arcade
to be updated, the result is great, with a 3-D perspective and
adventure mode that are excellent additions to what was always an
insanely addictive game. For the tragically nostalgic, the arcade
version is included (no quarters needed). &UR;  &QL; 
Nintendo 64 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Star Wars Episode 1 Racer (LucasArts) - As with the movie, the
game is very fast and fluid, particularly with the Expansion Pak
memory upgrade. It initially plunks you in the movie's most
exciting sequence, the rocket pod race, then provides a wide
variety of other courses to challenge you. You'll be hard-pressed
to move up without canny piloting and smart equipment upgrades. A
must for ``Star Wars'' fans, pretty close to that for racing fans.
</P>
<P>
   Lode Runner 3D (Infogrames) _ The venerable side-scroller gets
an extra dimension, and remains a fun, if slow-paced puzzler,
complete with red-robed mad monks, bombs and blasters, and dozens
of levels to work through. If you liked earlier versions of Lode
Runner, you should enjoy this one.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr.'s Slugfest (Nintendo) _ A great game that takes
excellent advantage of the N64's graphics power. Create your own
player _ heck, your own roster _ and play through a wide variety of
game options, authentic parks, weather effects, even a home-run
derby. Good controls, too. There's also an excellent Game Boy
version of the game for up to four people.
</P>
<P>
   A Bug's Life (Activision) _ The well-done game from
Pixar/Disney's massive animated film hit comes to the N64
relatively intact. This version looks good, and it handles much as
the PlayStation and PC versions do. N64's limits have forced some
changes, including interstitial mini-bonus rounds. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Game Boy
</P>
<P>
   Barbie Ocean Discovery (Mattel) _ The world's biggest toy
company makes a first foray into the handheld market for girl
gamers with an underwater adventure where Barbie solves puzzles,
mazes and other challenges to recover a lost treasure. It looks
great and is a nice change of pace from the blast-away crowd, but
it didn't hold my 8-year-old (Barbie-loving) daughter's interest
for long.
</P>
<P>
   The Smurfs' Nightmare (Infogrames) _ Hefty Smurf has to solve
puzzles and gather objects to wake his fellow short blue people
from their bad dreams. A color-only Game Boy title, my son in
particular loves this challenging little adventure, though adults
with a high tolerance for blue can enjoy it as well.
</P>
<P>
   Prince of Persia (Red Orb) _ The classic adventure puzzler hops
to Game Boy, and in good form. You have to figure out how to work
your way through fiendishly challenging dungeons without getting
smushed, speared or run through.
</P>
<P>
   V-Rally Edition '99 (Infogrames) _ A color-only racing game with
good variety in everything from weather conditions to tracks, as
well as official cars from several big-name racing teams. This
title is actually a great fit for the Game Boy Color.
</P>
<P>
   Conker's Pocket Tales (Nintendo) _ Nintendo's in-house game
wizards at Rare Ltd. have come up with this hybrid
action/adventure/role-playing game featuring a squirrel. Kids
should adore this one, and it sprawls far and wide. Recommended. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ H.K. Desai, president and chief executive of
Qlogic Corp., has a ready answer when asked what he thinks of his
competitor, Emulex Corp. ``In my culture,'' quips Desai, a native
of India, ``we are not allowed to say bad things about our
parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Qlogic was indeed part of Emulex until a 1994 spinoff, and even
today the companies occupy adjacent buildings in Costa Mesa,
Calif., sharing a courtyard, a conference room and a Ping-Pong
table. But parent and child are now becoming head-on competitors in
one of the hottest new areas in computer data storage.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies are vying for leadership in fiber channel
technology, a new industry-standard approach to high-speed data
transfer between computers and separate data-storage disk drives.
With corporations needing ever faster access to larger amounts of
data, particularly to run Web sites, fiber channel sales look set
to soar.
</P>
<P>
   The shares of both companies, in fact, have already soared.
Qlogic stock has rocketed from less than $14 a year ago, closing
Friday at $139.50, while Emulex shares have zoomed from less than
$6 to Friday's close of $103.
</P>
<P>
   Other fiber channel companies have also captured investor
enthusiasm. Brocade Communications Corp., a San Jose, Calif.,
company that makes switches for networks that connect disk drives
to computers, went public at $19 a share on May 24. On Friday, its
shares closed at $103.75.
</P>
<P>
   Fiber channel is viewed by many in the computer industry as the
likely successor to the existing, longtime standard known as the
small computer systems interface _ written inelegantly as SCSI and
pronounced even more inelegantly as ``scuzzy.'' As its name
implies, fiber channel uses optical fibers for high speed
transmission, although there is also a more limited version that
uses copper wires.
</P>
<P>
   Fiber channel allows data to flow at 1 billion bits per second,
somewhat faster than SCSI. But its real advantage is flexibility.
SCSI is limited to 15 data storage devices, all within a few yards
of one another. Fiber channel can connect hundreds, and the disk
drives can be as far as six miles away from the computer.
</P>
<P>
   That flexibility is allowing corporations to link disk drives in
what is being called a storage area network, or SAN.
</P>
<P>
   With SCSI systems, each data storage device, usually an array of
disk drives in a single box, is connected to a single computer that
is known as a server and might be shared by many users. With a SAN,
multiple servers can connect directly with any disk drive array,
avoiding bottlenecks and providing redundancy in case one server
malfunctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more of the storage is going into mission-critical
applications _ things connected to the Internet that have to be
available 24 hours a day,'' said Robert Gray, a research director
at International Data Corp., a market research firm in Framingham,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   EMF Associates, a market research and consulting firm in Half
Moon Bay, Calif., projects overall sales of fiber channel equipment
to mushroom to $23 billion in 2002 from $3.5 billion in 1998. Much
of that will be for the data storage devices themselves. Another
big part will be switches that direct traffic between drives and
servers in the storage area network, such as those made by Brocade,
Ancor Communications of Minnesota and Gadzoox Networks Inc., a San
Jose, Calif., start-up company.
</P>
<P>
   Qlogic and Emulex make circuit boards known as host adapters,
which enable computers to be connected to fiber channel networks.
That is still a relatively small part of the business, worth about
$80 million last year, according to International Data.
</P>
<P>
   But those sales are expected to grow to $800 million by 2002.
And for small companies like Qlogic and Emulex, with annual
revenues around $100 million, that is a big market indeed. Right
now, they are the leaders along with Jaycor Networks Inc., a
privately held company in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Qlogic and Emulex did not see themselves as competitors when the
spinoff occurred. Qlogic was the semiconductor division of Emulex,
a company that originally made disk storage products for Digital
Equipment Corp. minicomputers. But Emulex got out of that business
in the late 1980s and began selling circuit boards to connect
printers to networks. It decided it no longer needed its own
semiconductor division, and so it cut loose Qlogic.
</P>
<P>
   Emulex has had the tougher time of the two. With its other
businesses shrinking, Emulex bet its future on fiber channel,
bringing out its first products several years ago. But only
recently has the growth from its fiber channel products been enough
to offset declines in its other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The company had revenues of $18.2 million in the quarter ended
in March, up 21 percent from $15 million a year earlier. But sales
of fiber channel products more than doubled, to $11.2 million, and
accounted for 62 percent of total sales. Net income was $1.36
million, compared with a loss from restructuring charges a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Qlogic _ the ``Q'' is said to stand for quality or quickness _
was making chips and circuit boards for the SCSI system.
</P>
<P>
   Desai, who was Qlogic's head of engineering, left in May 1995,
unhappy with the company's direction. Three months later, with the
company losing money, he returned as chief executive. He ended
retail sales and began development of fiber channel products.
</P>
<P>
   Profits have risen for 15 consecutive quarters and Qlogic raced
past its former parent in sales and market value. Qlogic has a
market capitalization of $2.5 billion, compared with Emulex's $840
million.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Qlogic's fiber channel business accounted for only $7.3 million
of its $35.1 million in revenues in the March quarter. It does not
break out profits by product line, but Desai said the fiber channel
business was profitable. And even though the SCSI business is still
growing, the fiber channel business is growing faster, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is enamored of fiber channel. Adaptec Inc., the
leader in the SCSI business, sold its fiber channel business to
Jaycor Networks, although it retains a small stake in Jaycor.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Frymyer, a spokesman for Adaptec, said that two new data
input/output technologies under development could compete with
fiber channel. One is Future I/O, supported by Compaq Computer,
Hewlett-Packard, IBM and other companies. Another is Next
Generation I/O, supported by Intel Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Another risk for Emulex, Qlogic and Jaycor is that big computer
and disk drive makers might decide to make their own adapter cards,
as Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard are doing to some extent,
rather than buy from outside suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Right now there is plenty of business for both Qlogic and
Emulex, and they say their rivalry is friendly. ``It's more like a
family type of feuding,'' Desai said. ``We still have a lot of
respect for each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, with their businesses so clearly converging, one
wonders whether the spinoff was necessary in the first place. But
the executives express no regrets. ``I don't think we'd be where we
are today if we hadn't been independent companies,'' said Paul
Folino, the president and chief executive of Emulex. ``It allowed
us to get there faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, for shareholders it has been a good deal. An owner of
one share of Emulex worth $12 before the spinoff would now own one
Emulex share and two Qlogic shares worth a total of $382.
</P>
<P>
   Executives also dismissed any thought of combining again. In any
case, that will get harder. Qlogic, in need of more space, is about
to cut the final apron strings by moving to a new, larger
headquarters elsewhere in Orange County. Parent and child will
continue to compete in the marketplace but no longer at the
Ping-Pong table.

BOOKSELLER IS READY TO OFFER TEXTBOOKS ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LISA GUERNSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An online bookshop has a new offer for college bookstores that
are struggling with the fickle business of textbook sales: Why not
let us sell those books for you instead?
</P>
<P>
   The company, Varsitybooks.com, plans to announce this week that
it has signed contracts with nearly a dozen small universities,
colleges, preparatory schools and distance-education programs to do
just that.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the arrangements mean that schools are completely
closing their book-selling operations and sending their students to
the company's Web site to buy their textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   In each deal, the institutions will earn an undisclosed
percentage from the sale of each book through the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can outsource this and quite literally shut the door on
their bookstores,'' said Eric Kuhn, the president and chief
executive of Varsitybooks, based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, students in large campus towns have always had the
option of buying textbooks from bookstores off campus, if they
could find ones that stocked the books they needed. But for
colleges, particularly smaller ones, there is an allure to turning
over sales of the textbooks that teachers order for their courses.
Textbook sales are the least profitable part of the business of
running a college store, according to the National Association of
College Stores.
</P>
<P>
   And the squeeze is becoming worse, some store managers say, now
that they are facing competition online from merchants like
Varsitybooks and other Internet start-up companies such as
Bigwords.com, in San Francisco, and Ecampus.com, in Lexington, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this tough business environment, though, Jerry Buchs, a
spokesman for the National Association of College Stores, said that
most universities were not ready to relinquish their book selling
to an online company. Instead, he said, they will try to establish
a Web presence while maintaining their physical stores to provide
``one-on-one customer service.''
</P>
<P>
   Follett, a bookstore chain based in River Grove, Ill., is taking
that approach. It has built a Web site, www.efollett.com, that
provides online ordering for 600 brick-and-mortar stores that it
already manages and for about 150 others that pay Follett to be
part of its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Varsitybooks' Web site, which opened last summer, features book
lists from more than 200 colleges _ although, until now, not as the
exclusive sales agent for the schools.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the 11 institutions that have been willing to entrust
Varsitybooks with their textbook sales operations are small private
universities like Alaska Pacific University, preparatory schools
like St. Agnes Academy in Houston and distance-education programs
like ISIM University in Denver.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kuhn started the company with Tim Levy, a friend from his
law-school days at George Washington University. The men, both in
their 20s, said they wanted to give students an alternative to the
bother of standing in line for textbooks. They made a deal with
Baker &AMP; Taylor, a huge textbook distributor in Charlotte, N.C., to
fulfill orders placed through Varsitybooks.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Pacific University in Anchorage is one of the four-year
institutions that have signed up with Varsitybooks. Brian Douglas,
the university's assistant business manager, said he had asked for
the company's help in part because students were already starting
to shop online.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't participate, it is going to happen anyway,''
Douglas said. ``We'd rather do it in an organized fashion that
helps our students.''

RECORD LABELS ASSERT CONTROL IN CYBERSPACE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ When it comes to portents of gloom, doom and
despair, the record industry has lately been ticking off a litany
of threats, real and imagined, posed by the Internet: Bands selling
new albums directly over the Net; independent artists and labels
posting thousands of music files online; music piracy on the Web,
and online audio sites creating vast libraries of tunes.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, the major labels show no signs of ceding their reign
over the music business. In fact, despite a few early setbacks and
some critical hurdles ahead, the recording industry now seems
intent on taking a leading role in digital distribution.
</P>
<P>
   That fact was underscored by the announcement last week that
recording, technology and consumer electronics companies had agreed
to standards for protecting music copyrights in online music sales.
In the last 18 months, the major labels have waged a remarkably
successful war against piracy on the Net, using their music
libraries and stables of popular artists as tools to persuade
technology companies to cooperate, and have positioned themselves
to dominate the digital music era.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighteen months ago, people in the tech community told me I
was crazy to think we could develop an online music business'' that
protected copyright interests of artists and labels, said Hilary
Rosen, president and chief executive of Recording Industry
Association of America, which represents the five major record
labels _ Sony, Universal, Warner, BMG and EMI. But today, she said,
it was clear that ``we're moving out of the piracy era into a more
legitimate marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Nathanson, a music industry analyst with Sanford C.
Bernstein &AMP; Co., said the standards announced last week by the
Secure Digital Music Initiative, a consortium representing the
recording, consumer electronics and computer industries, would not
mean a ``slam dunk'' for the labels to sell music online. Still to
be resolved, he noted, are pressing business model and technology
questions. But, he asserted, the industry had managed to dominate
the debate with its agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``The collective good of these five companies overruled any
other competing interest,'' Nathanson said.
</P>
<P>
   That will become more apparent to consumers this fall, when the
major labels, which sell 85 percent of music in the United States,
begin putting their libraries online. They hope to have their
products in place for the Christmas season, when portable digital
players hit the market en masse, signaling the movement of online
music into the mainstream and creating new demand for downloadable
tunes.
</P>
<P>
   But that has not quieted cries from the nearly $14 billion
record industry that Internet piracy _ illegal copying and
downloading of music in cyberspace _ is costing labels and artists
tens of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement last week of the consortium standards _
guidelines for preventing portable devices from playing illegally
obtained music _ complements the recording industry's continuing
effort to educate the public about music piracy and to crack down
on it.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, the industry has spent more than $1
million on an information campaign, predominantly at universities,
in an effort to persuade campuses to take steps to prevent piracy
and to persuade students not to participate in illicit swapping of
music files. Ms. Rosen said more than 200 universities had joined
RIAA's effort to discourage students from using campus computers or
Internet connections to make illegal copies of recordings.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has also wielded a stick. Ms. Rosen said RIAA had
forced the shutdown of some 2,000 sites offering pirated copies of
music _ songs copied from commercial compact disks and uploaded to
the Internet _ by sending cease and desist letters to the Internet
service providers that hosted the sites. ``It used to be each day
our surfers would come and there would be hundreds of sites to go
after,'' she said. ``The number is significantly lower.''
</P>
<P>
   To others, the state of piracy remains a matter of debate.
Joanne Marino, chief executive and editor of Webnoize, an online
new-media and music industry publication, said last week that
piracy facilitated by Web sites appeared to have declined
significantly. But she said it was growing in other Internet
channels, including songs being exchanged as e-mail attachments or
made available in chat rooms or on Internet file-transfer, or FTP,
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Marino said a recent Webnoize survey of 2,000 college
students showed that digital downloading of music was increasing.
She said that from December 1998 to April, the survey found a 3,000
percent jump in the number of students who said they had downloaded
250 or more music files.
</P>
<P>
   But a more persuasive restraint to piracy than any single effort
by the music industry is consolidation in the online entertainment
industry, with larger, more established companies buying smaller
Internet start-ups. Among recent deals, America Online acquired the
online radio site Spinner.com; MTV's parent, Viacom, purchased
Imagine Radio, and Yahoo announced plans to acquire Broadcast.com.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Morgenstern, senior vice president for new media at the
American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, or ASCAP,
which collects royalties for copyright holders, said that these
bigger companies were eager to play by established copyright rules.
And, he added, ``As more and more start-ups are interested in going
public, they are likely to take care of the rights situation.''
</P>
<P>
   That transition is likely to be sealed by the consortium
standards.
</P>
<P>
   So how did the music industry persuade technology companies and
consumer electronics makers to play along?
</P>
<P>
   Technology companies say they realized that the online music
market could become huge _ but only if the music companies agreed
to participate and to put their libraries online. That meant
acceding to the industry's demand that portable devices and desktop
computers be prevented from playing music downloaded illegally from
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative was to ``change the power structure of the
industry,'' said Phil Barrett, senior vice president for media
technologies at RealNetworks Inc., maker of Real Player. ``I'm not
sure it's a good thing, and it's not an easy thing. Creating a
marketplace that's easy is paramount. Without it, you don't have an
industry.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Barrett, who sat in on the consortium talks, described them as
``surprisingly cooperative.'' But not all parties walked away with
a good taste in their mouths. Some Internet music companies that
post songs of independent labels and musicians said the major
labels had co-opted computer and electronics companies to brake the
momentum of the Net as an alternative source of music.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an attempt to maintain control of distribution,'' said
Steve Grady, vice president for marketing for Emusic.com, a Redwood
City, Calif., company that sells 6,000 tracks by independent
artists. Grady said the industry may find that the train has
already left the station and that it will not be simple to create
technology that protects copyrights without hindering the
tremendous flexibility the Net now provides in permitting people to
trade, download, store and play music.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet consumers have already chosen the operating
system for downloadable music. Right now, that's MP3,'' he said,
referring to a type of audio file that has frustrated the music
industry because it can be easily pirated.
</P>
<P>
   While members of the recording industry are expressing newfound
optimism, they also assert that the technological and business
challenges ahead will be steep. Larry Kenswil, president for
electronic commerce for Universal Music Group, the largest record
company, said the company planned to be online by Christmas but
that a ``full-fledged launch'' might happen only next spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes an amazing amount of work to prepare the content,''
he said.

   ATLANTA _ Imagine what it would be like if your best friend
owned a pig that could sing.
</P>
<P>
   You'd be able to invite everyone over on a Saturday night and
have the pig perform _ maybe Shubert's ``Trout.''
</P>
<P>
   At first it would really be neat. Everyone would forgive the pig
for not having a voice like Frank Sinatra or Ella Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   But pretty soon the novelty wouldn't be enough and _ when you
really wanted to hear music _ you'd turn to someone who was less of
a swine and more a singer.
</P>
<P>
   In the technology world, there are plenty of pigs that can sing.
There's a temptation to create a product just because it is
technologically possible without regard for whether the new
technology is better than the old.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes these gizmos are nifty and impressive but just aren't
as useful as the technology they attempt to replace. Enough
philosophizing _ let's listen to some pigs that sing off-key.
</P>
<P>
   _ Using your computer as an answering machine is dumb. Many PCs
come with software to let your PC's modem answer the call and then
use the PC's hard disk to record the incoming messages as voice
files. Truth is, it works. But so does a $30 answering machine _ in
fact, the cheap answering machine works better. It also doesn't
require keeping your PC on 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Several companies, including Panasonic, now make tiny DVD
players. For right under $1,000, you can watch a DVD movie on its
5.8-inch screen. But imagine, if you will, watching ``Saving
Private Ryan'' that way, or picture a basketball game played by
ants (some users report that they can't even read the title on the
little screen). To be fair, this sucker will also hook up to your
regular TV. But if that's what you want, get one of the $300 AC
models that are meant to work that way.
</P>
<P>
   _ E-books. We'll be looking at them in more detail in a later
edition of this column. Maybe you already know, these are
electronic gizmos that allow you to download the text of a book and
then view the book on the screen. You'll pay about $500 for the
most popular reader _ the Rocket eBook. Then you'll pay about $20
for each book you buy. Would you rather buy a $6 paperback you can
read in the bathtub and then lend to your buddy, or do you want to
spend $20 on an e-book and read it on a machine? Also, if you drop
the paperback or hardback, it will make a loud slapping sound and
then work just fine. If you drop the eBook, it also will make a
loud sound, and you'll be about $500 poorer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Using your computer monitor to watch TV. You can get TV cards
that let you attach an antenna or a cable connection and receive TV
signals and then watch them on your computer monitor. Now think
about it. I can either sit down in my leather reclining chair and
watch TV on my big-screen monitor, or I can sit at a desk chair and
watch TV on my PC's 17-inch monitor. Duh.
</P>
<P>
   These are my singing pigs. I'm not telling you that they'll be
your pigs. There's almost certainly someone out there with a
special circumstance just made for one of these gadgets. But you
probably aren't that person. Save your money and, instead, get a
good CD recording of Ella or Frank.

DJX Keyboard makes music fun 
By James Cummings  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Yamaha DJX portable keyboard offers some of the
features of professional electronic keyboards at a price that makes
it accessible to younger customers, according to Yamaha Corp. of
America.
</P>
<P>
   The keyboard is focused on dance styles and has automatic
accompaniment capabilities for music ranging from ``Rap'' to
``Techno'' to ``Rave.'' It also offers sounds such as sampled drum
loops and human voices.
</P>
<P>
   The DJX, like most portable keyboards for the amateur market, is
designed so that even a novice can make music immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The suggested retail price for the DJX keyboard is $459.95,
which is significantly cheaper than professional model keyboards
with the same types of accompaniments and sound styles, according
to Yamaha.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yamaha DJX could well be the Nintendo of the music
industry,'' said Yamaha marketing executive Jim Presley.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Ace Music Superstore in Dayton said the
store carries the DJX but they sell out quickly whenever a shipment
comes in.
</P>
<P>
   You can get additional information about the keyboard at the
Yamaha Web site at www.yamaha.com.

Suite deal: The right office software can make business jungle a
garden 
By Charles Haddad  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They're called ``office suites,'' but this type of
software is more like a warehouse, offering features in bulk.
</P>
<P>
   No longer do these suites simply let you write memos and analyze
numbers. With these programs you can now add complex tables to
reports, convert numbers into colorful 3D charts and publish
documents on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   While powerful, these programs are also overwhelming. Your eyes
glaze over reading down the list of features. How, then, do you
choose which one is right for you or your business?
</P>
<P>
   To help guide your decision, we took a close look at the latest
versions of the top three office suites: market leader Microsoft
Office 2000, WordPerfect 2000 and SmartSuite Millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The three are more alike than different. Each includes a word
processor, spreadsheet, a limited personal information manager,
presentation software and a database.
</P>
<P>
   To varying degrees of success, each of these programs lets you
paste a spreadsheet in a report, add written notes to spreadsheets
or publish database numbers in a document table.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, each program offers toolbars of buttons that let
you automate routine tasks. At the click of a button you can add
styles to a document, correct spelling errors and total up columns
of numbers.
</P>
<P>
   WordPerfect and SmartSuite also will easily read and convert
Office 2000 documents. Neither program could survive as an Office
alternative without this ability.
</P>
<P>
   And, ever in tune with what's fashionable, all three programs
let you publish documents on an in-house network or on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are taking about here are hairline differences between
the different programs,'' says Michael Lasky, senior associate
editor at PC World. He has worked with and reviewed all three of
the suites over the years.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest difference among the three programs is price. Office
2000 is the most expensive, with its minimum version costing $499.
On the other end of the scale is WordPerfect. Its most expensive
package is only $209.
</P>
<P>
   Another key difference among the three programs is in feel and
approach. Office 2000 lets you customize just about every feature
in a mind-boggling array of choices. In contrast, SmartSuite favors
a simpler interface but limits how much you can customize the
program.
</P>
<P>
   While offering identical packages of software, the suites are
not uniform in performance. WordPerfect is considered by many to
have the best word processor in terms of features and ease of use.
Office 2000 remains the leader in spreadsheets with its Excel
program.
</P>
<P>
   What follows is an analysis of each suite's strengths and
weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   Office 2000
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, Microsoft's suite is the standard by which the
other two suites are judged. That's because Office makes up 90
percent of the market for suite software.
</P>
<P>
   Office's greatest strength is its vast feature set. That is also
its greatest weakness. Many users are simply overwhelmed by the
choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a jungle in there,'' says Lasky about Office 2000's inner
workings. ``You have to navigate such a thicket of features just to
write a letter.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Office 2000 strength is something called cross platform
compatibility. That means PC and Mac users can easily open each
other's documents created in Office.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of Office remains the suite's Word word processing and
Excel spreadsheet programs, which remain largely unchanged from
earlier versions. Microsoft, however, has added several helpful
enhancements in its latest version, released earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Top of the list is something called multiple clipboards, which
lets you save up to 12 different things simultaneously. This is a
new feature for a PC program, although Mac word processor Nisus
Writer has been able to do this for years.
</P>
<P>
   Another Office 2000 innovation is smart menus. The program
observes how you work and then lists it in its pull-down menus only
those commands most used. The idea is to cut down on the clutter of
functions.
</P>
<P>
   Other Office 2000 innovations include the ability to insert text
or graphics anywhere on a page and a feature called self-repair.
The program will automatically replace key files mistakenly
deleted.
</P>
<P>
   WordPerfect 2000
</P>
<P>
   Believe or not, there was a time when WordPerfect was the
leading word processor. To this day it remains a strong program and
retains a loyal following.
</P>
<P>
   One of the features that makes WordPerfect's word processor so
strong is its use of the NaturallySpeaking voice recognition
technology. Developed by Dragon Software, NaturallySpeaking lets
WordPerfect type as you talk. You must, however, first train
NaturallySpeaking to recognize your pronunciation.
</P>
<P>
   Office 2000 doesn't yet include any voice recognition
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Another WordPerfect innovation is something called RealTime
Preview. This is a feature that lets you edit, changing text and
margins, a document in the print preview mode.
</P>
<P>
   WordPerfect will also let you drag and drop images, sound and
video clips into an electronic scrapbook.
</P>
<P>
   The software's weakest link is its spreadsheet program, Quattro
Pro. That's not to say Quattro Pro is bad. It's just not as strong
as those in SmartSuite and Office.
</P>
<P>
   SmartSuite
</P>
<P>
   SmartSuite strengths are threefold: great Web publishing and
groupware tools and exceptional integration with Lotus Notes,
SmartSuite's sister e-mail program.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of SmartSuite's Web publishing tools is a feature
called FastSite. It lets users easily and quickly convert print
documents into Web pages. For example, FastSite automatically adds
Web navigation tools to converted documents and builds a home page
and a table of contents.
</P>
<P>
   ``SmartSuite's Internet features and ease of use leaves other
suites in the dust,'' PC magazine said in a recent review of the
software.
</P>
<P>
   The second strength is a set of groupware tools. These tools let
several users worked simultaneously on the same document,
highlighting who made what changes and keeping track of them.
</P>
<P>
   Office 2000 also has groupware tools, but they're not considered
as strong as those in SmartSuite.
</P>
<P>
   SmartSuite has a good, if less feature-rich, writing program in
Word Pro. Its spreadsheet program, 1-2-3 is considered second to
Office's Excel.
</P>
<P>
   SmartSuite also has voice recognition technology, called
ViaVoice. ViaVoice is considered harder to train and less accurate
than NaturallySpeaking. But it does have one advantage over
NaturallySpeaking. ViaVoice can read back text.
</P>
<P>
   What SmartSuite lacks is the high-level of automation offered by
Office 2000. It's also hard to customize. SmartSuite's scripting
language is daunting to anyone but a professional programmer.
</P>
<P>
   So what program is best suited for you? It depends on your
needs.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to march in step with most of the corporate world
than Office 2000 is your choice. In addition, Office 2000 remains,
overall, the most powerful of the suites.
</P>
<P>
   However, if price is a big consideration, you should give
WordPerfect a close look. It delivers the most bang for the buck.
</P>
<P>
   And, if you need to publish a lot online, then SmartSuite might
be best for you.

Better OS eases sharing, surfing 
By Charles Haddad  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Imagine a Mac that several users could share, with
each maintaining a different configuration of folders, applications
and even desktop patterns.
</P>
<P>
   What if that shared Mac could switch among these individual
configurations based on the voice of the user?
</P>
<P>
   Such power is part of the latest upgrade to the Mac OS, or
operating system, scheduled for release this fall. It will come
less than six months from the last upgrade, OS 8.6.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in the past 18 months, Apple has done a great job in
releasing regular and reliable upgrades to its OS. The OS controls
how your Mac works, from the look of the screen to how you navigate
through the hard disk. The better the OS, the more a Mac can do and
do well.
</P>
<P>
   The fall upgrade, code-named Sonata, will include major
improvements to the Mac's ability to support multiple users and Web
connectivity. Sonata will be released commercially as OS 8.7.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Apple Computer is saying little about Sonata. But
beta testers of this upgrade have been talking plenty with others.
Reports about Sonata and its key features are proliferating across
the Web, featured at such sites as Apple Insider, MacIntouch and
Webintosh.
</P>
<P>
   Following is a summary of the most reliable information gleaned
about Sonata from these sites.
</P>
<P>
   Sonata's biggest change will be an expanded ability for Macs to
handle multiple users. With Sonata, several people will be able to
share a Mac and keep separate, password-protected work
environments.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, no one but you _ or a system administrator if
your Mac is on a network _ will be able to change your setup. Among
the things you'll be able to customize will be look, file access
and Internet configuration.
</P>
<P>
   You can sign onto a Mac configured for multiple users via a
written password or through voice recognition. Sonata will include
a new control panel called Voice Password Assistant.
</P>
<P>
   With Voice Password, you select a spoken code word and say it
until the system understands your voice and the code word. Then a
user can sign onto a Mac by selecting his or her name and saying
the correct password.
</P>
<P>
   Another OS feature getting an overhaul is Apple's new Sherlock
search technology. Sherlock lets users search not only their hard
drive but the Internet from their computers.
</P>
<P>
   Sonata will add two new important searches to Sherlock. The
first is for people. Sherlock will search via the Web telephone
numbers and e-mail addresses. What it finds will be listed on your
computer in the Sherlock window.
</P>
<P>
   The second new search is for e-commerce. Type the name of a
product into Sherlock, and it will search the Web for varying
prices and availability of the product, listing the results on your
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Many more changes are coming with Sonata, many of which are
minor enhancements and bug fixes. To learn more about this upgrade,
check out Apple Insider at www.appleinsider.com

MANY SITES FAILURES AT USABILITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAVID HOYE   
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Do you know Jakob Nielsen? &QL; 
Probably not. But you should, especially if you ever plan to make
money from a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The Northern California resident has been called one of the
Web's 10 most influential people, a group that also includes the
likes of America Online's Steve Case, Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com and
William Kennard, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen is the guy the ``New York Times'' once dubbed the ``guru
of Web page usability,'' a man for whom Web design is not a matter
of taste or aesthetics _ it's a matter of science.`
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen, who was in Phoenix to address an annual meeting of Web
usability experts from around the country, has made a career out of
studying what makes a Web site work and what makes a site fail.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing the difference between the two is crucial for anyone
venturing into the largely uncharted seas of e-commerce, or buying
and selling online.
</P>
<P>
   E-commerce has quickly gone from being an experiment involving a
few companies to a requirement for any business that wants to
succeed. International Data Corp. recently estimated that online
spending will hit $1 trillion by 2003. Sales people already know
that success means outselling their company's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Despite signs that e-commerce is booming, Nielsen says the vast
majority of business-related Web sites are failures at usability.
Generally, that means average users find it too difficult to
navigate the sites, find the products or information they want and
spend money.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Web, the power rests with he or she who clicks the
mouse,'' Nielsen said during an interview last week. ``If (a Web
site) is difficult to use or you can't find anything, what's the
customer's reaction? It's to go someplace else. You lose your
chance at the next generation economy if it's not easy to use your
site.''
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen said the problem affects Web sites operated by companies
of all sizes. Having cash to spend on fancy designs doesn't seem to
matter.
</P>
<P>
   The most frequent mistakes he finds include:
</P>
<P>
   - Using the latest in Web technology despite the fact that it
does nothing to enhance the usability of the site.
</P>
<P>
   - Depending on complex URLs, or Web-page addresses, that include
strings of numbers and symbols instead of simple words that users
can remember.
</P>
<P>
   - Outdated content that shows users nobody is minding the online
store.
</P>
<P>
   - Opening new browser windows when the user clicks on a link,
something Nielsen equates with a vacuum cleaner salesman who begins
a visit by dumping an ashtray on your carpet.
</P>
<P>
   - Slow servers and pages that take too long to download.
</P>
<P>
   Fixing problem Web sites, he says, has to be done on an
individual basis. No single format can work for every online
business. But basic steps all follow the same thread.
</P>
<P>
   Design for the user, not the guys in marketing or the boss
upstairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason why some sites get famous, like Amazon.com, is that
they make usability the primary focus. What makes it easy for
people to buy a book or CD?'' Nielsen said. ``They are not
geniuses. I've noticed them doing stupid things. But if they make a
mistake, they fix it immediately. They know what works and what
doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   While designing or redesigning a Web site, Nielsen urges that
the ``feel'' of the site needs to be given more importance than the
``look.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Feeling dominates over the look,'' he says. ``It's freedom to
navigate and move around. Do the users feel empowered? Or are they
sluggish, like they are swimming in a sea of oil? Do they feel lost
and abandoned?''
</P>
<P>
   One quick way to test the feeling of your site: Find out if
users know what's going to happen when they click on a link or
button. If they do, that's good. Your site is open and predictable.
If the user gets surprised and says, ``Oops!'' there's work to be
done.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen said he has developed three main rules to follow in
determining what works on a Web site and what doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   They are:
</P>
<P>
   - Test your site with representative customers, not the guy in
the next cubicle who already knows all there is to know about your
company.
</P>
<P>
   - While testing your site, have the representative customers do
real tasks or solve real problems. If it's an airline site, have
them try to book a flight.
</P>
<P>
   - Shut up. Let the users do the talking. If they keep clicking
the wrong buttons, change the buttons. ``If the customer clicks on
the wrong button,'' he says, ``it's not because they are stupid,
it's because your design is wrong.''
</P>

   If you're in the market for a new computer, check out the July
issue of ``PC'' magazine. Beginning on page 183, you'll find the
results from the magazine's 12th annual Readers' Choice survey for
service and reliability.
</P>
<P>
   In grading desktop computers, Dell, IBM and Quantex were given
the highest mark, an A rating. In the B category were Apple,
Hewlett-Packard, Micron and Sony. The largest group, C, included
AT&AMP;T, Comp-USA, Digital, Gateway, NEC, Toshiba, Zenith Data
Systems, ZEOS and machines locally built.
</P>
<P>
   The D group included AST, Compaq and MidWest Micro. Rounding out
the desktop rating list were Acer and Packard Bell in the E group.
</P>
<P>
   As for notebook computers, IBM and Sony were rated A, Compaq,
Dell, Gateway, Micron and Toshiba earned a B rating, Acer, Apple,
Digital, Fujitsu, Hewlett-Packard, Hitachi and NEC completed the C
category, Texas Instruments and WinBook were given D ratings and
AST got the only E rating.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the computer makers might complain about their rankings.
But it's interesting to note that, for the most part, the rankings
have remained fairly constant for most of the vendors since 1993,
according to a chart published with the magazine story.
</P>
<P>
   In the desktop category, for example, Dell has earned A marks
each time the survey was taken, except for a single B rating it
received in 1995. Packard Bell, meanwhile, has earned a steady
stream of D and E ratings,except for a single C rating in 1995. &QL;

Health care information varies on Web 
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Seemingly endless oceans of information _ it is the
Internet's greatness and its most frustrating flaw. Type in a topic
and watch your powerful search engine come back with tens of
thousands of possible links. And it is true that sometimes people
who sail the Net arrive with a surplus of time and curiosity,
hoping for selections reaching to the horizon. But if a user just
wants a pressing question answered, then that sea can seem like an
infinite swamp. Then, he or she can be overwhelmed by an overeager
search engine. One reason to seek out a specialized site _ for
health care or whatever your interest _ is to narrow the view, to
have experts screen out enough of the flotsam so you can find what
you really need. We went to a number of the health care sites on
the Internet, wondering what kind of information would be offered
to an interested, but not expert, consumer. All the sites offer
links to other sources of information. All have lists of suggested
topics and while some had arthritis listed as a subject we could
click on, not all did. To compare, we found their search function,
typed in ``arthritis treatment'' and clicked. Here's some of what
we found.
</P>
<P>
   Adam.com (www.adam.com)
</P>
<P>
   Adam now aims to provide a wide-ranging site for many kinds of
users. However, the company made its name with graphics and data
for the health care professional, so it should be no surprise that
the 10 matches found were pretty specific. All 10 were links to
articles about treatments for types of arthritis: Psoriatic, viral,
rheumatoid, juvenile rheumatoid and so on.
</P>
<P>
   CareData.com (www.caredata.com)
</P>
<P>
   CareData does most of its work with institutions that want
access to its huge databases. But CareData has branched out to
consumers with its Citeline engine, coming up with 52,427 responses
to our query. Some links (like Colorado HealthNet) are pitched at a
narrow audience. Some sound intimidating (Arava Leflunomide
Recommended For Approval By FDA Advisory Committee). And some are
aimed at a broad swath of consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery Health (www.discoveryhealth.com)
</P>
<P>
   About 25 links came up. Some were technical, but most seemed
pitched at a general audience, including a number of
question-and-answer pieces, fact sheets and some news stories.
First up on the list was a cautionary article aimed at patients
that set the tone: ``In general, if you suffer from arthritis, it
is prudent to approach health claims made by most products with
healthy skepticism.''
</P>
<P>
   DrKoop.com (www.drkoop.com)
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to its namesake, former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop,
this site is one of the best-known. Eleven links were offered for
our inquiry, leading with a story about federal approval of a
dialysislike treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. Koop also proposed
several general articles about the condition, a suggestion that
education is key in controlling pain and several pieces about
particular versions of arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   Intelihealth (www.intelihealth.com)
</P>
<P>
   Intelihealth is attached to another of the brand names in health
care: Johns Hopkins. The search for arthritis treatment produced a
list of dozens of documents. The first was a to-the-point, consumer
friendly introduction to basic treatments like medicine, diet and
exercise. Others provided lists of specialists, medications and
looks at some new and somewhat controversial approaches like
glocosamine. Intelihealth also offered some articles that seemed
completely unrelated. (For instance, why the stories about breast
cancer?)
</P>
<P>
   WebMD, Inc. (www.webmd.com)
</P>
<P>
   More than 5,100 links came up, starting with a series of
definitions and summaries of articles about drugs. Near the top of
the list were anti-inflammatory medicines like fenoprofen and
fluriprofen, as well as, something called galvanotherapy.
References were fairly specific, some of them pretty technical for
the average layperson.

ICANN NO MASTER OF ITS INTERNET DOMAIN 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JON SWARTZ   
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ICANN or I can't?
</P>
<P>
   The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers _ a
nonprofit concern created to relieve the federal government of the
task of dispensing Web addresses _ has been anything but master of
its own domain names.
</P>
<P>
   After three years of planning, haggling and negotiations by
government officials, computer geeks and private businesses, ICANN
was supposed to break Network Solutions Inc.'s monopoly for
registering domain names ending in .com, .net and .org. Beginning
in late June, ICANN was to delegate naming rights to America
Online, France Telecom and three other high-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
   At least that was the plan as of a month ago, before infighting
delayed the plan until at least July 16. Now, there is a power
struggle between NSI, which appears reluctant to relinquish
control, and ICANN, which has drawn accusations of making major
policy decisions behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a mess,'' acknowledged Christopher Clough, a spokesman
for NSI in Herndon, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone from consumer advocate Ralph Nader to the
ultra-conservative Americans for Tax Reform have taken pot shots at
the arrangement, and many are singling out ICANN.
</P>
<P>
   ``ICANN is a mushy, disorganized hodgepodge of an
organization,'' said Naseem Javed, president of ABC Namebank
International, a brand-name consulting company in New York and
frequent critic of ICANN.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't seem to have the proper hierarchy or people,''
Javed said. ``Basically, it's a team of 10 people responsible for
assigning 10,000 names a day. At $70 per name, that's a
multimillion-dollar business.''
</P>
<P>
   Politicians, meanwhile, are distressed by ICANN's secrecy that
led to such decisions as imposing a $1 per domain name registration
fee for administrative use. That backroom decision would create
within a year a $5.9 million fund for ICANN. (The previous group in
charge of administering domain names, IANA, had an annual budget of
$500,000.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Such decisions likely exceed the authority that (the
government) originally contemplated for ICANN,'' U.S. Rep. Thomas
Bliley Jr., R-Va., said in a scathing June 22 letter to ICANN
Chairman Esther Dyson. ``Rather than promote the Internet's
evolution, your organization's policies actually may jeopardize''
its growth.
</P>
<P>
   There are even rumblings inside the Beltway that Congress will
conduct hearings on ICANN and call Dyson to testify, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding matters, hackers broke into ICANN's computer servers
for several hours Friday, diverting traffic from its Web site to
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   But ICANN's harshest detractor is NSI _ which, of course, has
its own ax to grind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is disturbing that ICANN is making major policy decisions
behind closed-door meetings,'' Clough said.
</P>
<P>
   Some might argue that Clough is describing his own company. NSI,
benefiting from a federal contract and boasting a board sprinkled
with military-industrial types, is worth nearly $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In a phone interview from London, Dyson admitted that ICANN made
mistakes but said it has improved. The Los Angeles group holds
public hearings before its quarterly board meetings and posts the
text of its resolutions online (www.icann.org). It also is
hammering out a plan to select new board members.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson dismisses ICANN's critics as NSI mouthpieces who are part
of a scheme to gum up the transition of power. She said furor over
the $1 fee, for example, is their most outlandish gripe.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you use a national park, there is a $1 fee; if you use the
Internet, there should be a $1 fee,'' Dyson said. ``It is a minimal
tax but small compared to NSI, which charges $35 per year for
registration fees.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the acrimony, Dyson clearly is extending the olive
branch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to work with NSI; it would make everyone's life
much simpler,'' Dyson said. ``We're not trying to create a mess. We
really are not the bad guys. We're trying to create competition to
a monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   That, everyone agrees, eventually will benefit consumers. More
choices ultimately will result in cheaper registration fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should be a wake-up call,'' Javed said. ``E-commerce will
eventually be a $1 trillion business worldwide, and an organization
like ICANN needs to harness it.''
</P>
<P>
   LET THE BIDDING BEGIN: The domain-name business has been good to
Alexis Rosen.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen recently sold the rights to Mall.com, which he acquired
for pocket change in 1992, to an online shopping portal in Austin,
Texas, for at least $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   COL. 2 of NETFILES () &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really plan to sell it, but I got an incredible
offer,'' said Rosen, founder of Panix of New York, one of the first
Internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen also is one of the lucky cybersquatters. While other
individuals have been either sued or vilified by corporations over
the rights to Web addresses with trademarked names, Rosen made a
small fortune because he bought the rights to a generic title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps I had a foolish notion that the Net was for
educational _ not commercial _ purposes,'' Rosen said. ``If I was
in this for the money, I could have registered several thousand
(well-known domain) names and made $500 million.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, he'll settle for a healthy quarter-million dollars.

US TEAM VOWS TO ELEVATE GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLAREMONT, Calif. _ Some of them had caught televised snippets
of the ``other'' World Cup semifinal between snacks and chitchat at
their postmatch reception. The rest overheard updates from time to
time. One-nil, two-nil, three-nil, etc.
</P>
<P>
   The US women's soccer team wasn't surprised that the Chinese
beat the Norwegians in steamy Foxborough, Mass. Sunday night. What
surprised them, as it did everybody else, was the massive margin.
``A 5-0 score,'' concluded forward Tiffeny Milbrett with cocked
eyebrow, ``is very surprising.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, who've played the Chinese so often during the
past five years that they might as well be the Washington Generals,
knew that China was no worse than the second-best team on the
planet. And they knew that the rebuilding Norwegians weren't close
to the side that knocked the US out of the Cup in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected China to win,'' coach Tony DiCicco was saying
Tuesday, as his squad began preparing here for Saturday's sold-out
Rose Bowl showdown. ``I did not expect a 5-0 game. I expected
Norway would at least score.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese have never scored five goals on the US. Only once
have they scored more than two. But their humiliation of the
defending champions rang a warning bell that the Yanks were still
hearing Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The US is going to have to start playing soccer,'' midfielder
Michelle Akers said flatly. ``We've played so far on guts and
mentality. Our game hasn't been consistent even for 30 minutes at a
time. We're going to have to play 90 minutes of good soccer against
China.''
</P>
<P>
   A quick glance at the scorebook shows a US team that, with the
exception of its quarterfinal struggle with Germany, seems to have
cruised to the final on autopilot _ 3-0, 7-1, 3-0, 3-2, 2-0. But it
hasn't been nearly that easy and they haven't been nearly that
dominant.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans didn't put away the Danes until the 73d minute.
They gave up a goal to the Nigerians on their first rush. They put
a ball in their own net and fell behind twice to the Germans. They
didn't score on the North Koreans until the 56th minute. And their
two goals against Brazil came on a keeper giveaway and a penalty
kick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our personality players are going to have to start coming up
big and start sticking them in the net,'' Akers said. ``Our
midfield will have to start possessing the ball. Our defense has
done a terrific job for the most part, with the exception of a
couple of freakout periods. But we can't have any more freakout
periods.''
</P>
<P>
   Or else the Chinese, who've already beaten the US twice this
year and ended their 50-match home unbeaten streak in April, will
finish them off and carry off the Cup. The Americans might only
have gotten snippets and updates from Foxborough (they'll watch an
edited tape this week), but they were able to fill in the rest from
memory and imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew even before the media and the public did that there
were other teams that could win this Cup and China has always been
one of those teams,'' said DiCicco. ``They're playing with a lot of
confidence. And they're obviously on a mission.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese lost the bronze medal to the Americans last time by
shutout. They lost the Olympic gold medal to them by a goal in
1996. They lost the Goodwill Games to them last summer by shutout.
What does it take to stand atop a podium?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese must be bitter toward us,'' mused Milbrett.
``Until this year, every major competition since 1995 has always
gone our way. They must think, God, we've got to get this thorn out
of our side.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese have been spending so much time in airport departure
lounges (while keeping their body clocks set to Pacific Daylight
Time) that they haven't had much chance to check out their Yankee
tormentors. But they did get to watch some of their match against
Brazil before they went out and dismantled the Norwegians. ``The
teams were even, but Brazil needed more luck,'' observed coach Ma
Yuanan. ``But it was expected that the US would win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   It was expected, too, that the Chinese would win their semi. But
not by a walkover. ``Norway looked tired,'' keeper Briana Scurry
said. ``I've never seen them so tired.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese looked as if they could have played another 90
minutes. Then they boarded another cross-country jet (their
fourth), arrived here at dinnertime Monday and put their whole team
through a two-hour practice Tuesday afternoon in full uniform with
long sleeved jerseys in 95-degree heat.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese asked specifically for the 1 p.m. practice slot all
week. ``Because the final is at that time,'' Ma explained Tuesday.
His women are on a mission _ and the Americans hear the mission
bell clanging.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The grass may be greener on the West Coast for
Mo Vaughn, but life as an Anaheim Angel has not been what he was
hoping it would be.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely, Vaughn won't be returning to Fenway Park next week
for the All-Star Game. It's been a tough year for the former Red
Sox first baseman, whose first season with Anaheim got off to a
rough start on Opening Day because of an ankle injury. He has been
battling to make up ground ever since.
</P>
<P>
   With only 22 starts at first, Vaughn had only a slim chance in
the All-Star voting to be selected as a starter. He finished a
distant fourth in balloting, trailing Cleveland's Jim Thome,
Baltimore's Rafael Palmiero, and New York's Tino Martinez. Vaughn
has made 45 starts as designated hitter while recovering from
sprained ligaments and a bone bruise in his ankle, suffered when he
crashed into the dugout in pursuit of a foul ball.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn has been an All-Star three times, in 1995, 1996, and
1998. He was a starter in 1996, replacing an injured Frank Thomas
of the White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 and 1994, he was passed over for selection as the Red
Sox representative by manager Cito Gaston in favor of third baseman
Scott Cooper despite having better numbers. So Vaughn knows what
it's like to sit home during the midsummer classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no regrets if I don't make it,'' said Vaughn. ``If I
had come out strong the first three months of the season, maybe.
But everybody knows I got hurt and put myself in a situation where
I wasn't accustomed to. You can't expect to be on your game in that
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``My batting average (.285) isn't where it normally is,'' added
Vaughn, who entering Tuesday night's game had 16 home runs, 53 runs
batted in, and 14 multi-hit games. ``But I did manage to hit some
home runs and drive in some runs when I came back. We still have
some games left in the first half. Put up some numbers and get
ready for the second half, when we start winning our share of
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just being myself here. I think if you accept the role of
a leader you have to be accountable for one's self. Just coming to
work every day. We all know we're not going to be 100 percent all
the time. Do what you're capable of doing.''
</P>
<P>
   How much more Vaughn could have done is a matter of debate.
Vaughn's success in Boston was built on his passion for playing the
game and the intensity he brought to the table every night.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim fans haven't seen much evidence of that yet. They had
been promised an ultimate warrior, worth the $80 million, six-year
contract that Angels management shelled out last winter. The Vaughn
they've seen hasn't matched the hype. He was limping for weeks
after returning April 23 from the 15-day disabled list, though he
was named American League Player of the Week May 10-16.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that the Angels have placed 15 players on the disabled
list thus far this year, including such offensive stalwarts as Tim
Salmon, Jim Edmonds, and Gary DiSarcina, opponents are pitching
around Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mo's problem when he first came back was that he thought he
had to carry the load for all those guys,'' said hitting coach Rod
Carew. ``I told him no one guy can do that. I know I tried to do
the same thing when I came here years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn is aware that Anaheim fans look to him to be the
catalyst. In the clubhouse, he has tried to instill in the Angels
the intensity and daily commitment that he brought with him from
Boston. But it's hard to compete with so many players hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the same,'' said Vaughn. ``I know people talk about
leaders and this and that. But it took us a little while to get it
straight in Boston. It doesn't come overnight. It took two to three
years before things started to fall in place. You've got to be
patient in a situation like this. It's a slow-developing process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure if we'd get some runs and win some games, I'd feel a
lot better. I want to improve this situation in the second half and
go out there and do what I'm capable of doing and help this team.
I'm an old-fashioned baseball player. I don't drift off into a lot
of different things. My mentality or my IQ hasn't changed just
because I'm on the West Coast. I'll still try to bring that East
Coast intensity to this area and this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn said his ankle injury is simply a nagging problem. ``If I
played on Mars,'' he quipped, ``my type of game would involve the
same intensity. That's just the way I am. I think I'm strong enough
to go out there and make some things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his distance from Boston, he is still close to several
former teammates. The Mo Vaughn Foundation is going strong, and he
is working with the Gene Autry RBI youth baseball program locally.
Recently, he hosted 150 youths on a tour of Disneyland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am happy,'' he said. ``Overall, my family comes first. And
they're all happy that I'm happy, and out here doing a job. I plan
on coming back (to Boston) in the wintertime and doing some things
with the foundation. I'm out here, but things like that are
ongoing. It never stops.''

<P>
   Berman DeValerio &AMP; Pease seemed on the brink of extinction in
1995. Congress was considering a bill that would sharply cut the
number of class-action lawsuits filed by disgruntled shareholders _
the firm's lifeblood. Partner Glen DeValerio recalls saying one day
that summer, ``Oh my God, we're goners.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed. But more than four years later, the firm is not
only alive but prospering. It has emerged as one of the nation's
leading firms that specialize in representing individuals who
believe a downturn in a particular stock was caused by corporate
wrongdoing or poor management. The Boston firm has doubled its
staff, opened an office in California, and completed a renovation
at its pricey Liberty Square address.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an assumption that bill would put all of us low-life
plaintiffs' lawyers out of business,'' DeValerio says now. ``None
of us had any idea things would turn out like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the 1995 law _ which critics concede has eliminated some
meritless suits _ shareholder actions have thrived in part because
the Internet has given law firms the power to reach masses of
disgruntled investors willing to join a class of plaintiffs in the
hopes of getting a big settlement. Internet chat rooms are filled
with company gossip provided by investors _ gossip that's sometimes
used by lawyers to bolster a claim.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, public companies, especially high-flying high-tech
firms, are under more pressure than ever from Wall Street to meet
profit expectations so exacting that companies falling short by
even a penny a share can see their stock price crash. As companies
strain to meet quarterly projections, some have found themselves
embroiled in public battles with government regulators or their own
auditors over accounting methods, leaving them open to shareholder
suits.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the record 332 class-action lawsuits filed last
year on behalf of shareholders claimed companies had committed some
kind of accounting fraud. Faced with the prospect of a lengthy
trial, most firms chose to settle for amounts that were on the
average double what they were five years ago, observers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``These lawyers go out and find companies in that kind of bind,
and when they do it's not that hard to convince them to settle,''
says Louis Thompson, president and chief executive of the National
Investor Relations Institute, which represents about 2,600 public
companies nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Not all firms settle, however. Last year, Berman DeValerio &AMP;
Pease lost a high-profile suit they brought against Biogen Inc.,
alleging the company misled investors by touting the prospects of
an experimental drug that later was dropped after a series of
disappointing tests. That case was the first shareholder suit to
actually go to a jury in Massachusetts in about a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The recent rise in suits has renewed an age-old feud between the
lawyers who bring them and those who defend the companies targeted
by the actions. Shareholder attorneys claim they protect the
investing public from fraud and deception by big corporate
interests. But critics say the plaintiffs' attorneys exploit greedy
investors to drain companies that have done nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their suits are conceived in sin,'' says Jeff Rudman, a
prominent corporate defense attorney at the Boston firm of Hale &AMP;
Dorr, of his nemesis lawyers at Berman DeValerio &AMP; Pease. ``The
lawyers at that firm are honorable people, but I hate the business
they're in. I disagree with everything they stand for.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the controversy, industry observers say, surrounds
ambiguities in accounting rules. Under pressure from Wall Street,
many high-tech companies in recent years have interpreted the rules
in ways that allow them to record revenue earlier rather than
later. Alarmed, the federal Securities and Exchange Commission has
said the practice is blatant fraud and launched investigations of
companies across the country. Public auditors have frequently
demanded companies revise their earnings to reflect a more
conservative reading of the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many companies subjected to shareholder suits for
accounting fraud say they have done nothing worthy of being sued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Accounting is an art, not a science,'' says the investor
relations institute's Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of room for interpretation. As soon as there's
some kind of indication of a controversy, the lawyers are in there
with a suit.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies have continued to lobby for more protection in
Washington, where just last week President Clinton said he would
sign a bill that includes some protections to companies whose stock
prices fall because of Y2K computer glitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind that's just another example of the investing public
losing rights,'' says Peter Pease of Berman DeValerio &AMP; Pease.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defendants, the companies being sued, will say that all
these suits are frivolous. Instead of saying, `We need to protect
the investing public,' it's become very popular to say, `What we've
got to do is get rid of all the lawyers.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The debate over the legitimacy of shareholder suits has been
around at least since the 1920s, legal historians say. Laws meant
to protect stock market investors in the wake of the 1929 market
crash produced a wave of suits. They were brought by shareholders
who wanted to recover losses from companies they claimed had misled
them about their earnings prospects or had broken laws that sent
stock prices spiraling.
</P>
<P>
   But the practice also brought out a breed of lawyer much hated
in corporate boardrooms because they prowled the ticker tapes and
filed lawsuits against any company whose stock price fell.
</P>
<P>
   In more recent times, companies have been sued for any number of
reasons _ from accounting fraud and insider trading to making a
merger deal that didn't yield as much value as investors wanted.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1990s, shareholder lawyers had become so aggressive one
critic in 1995 congressional testimony said they were ``the scourge
of the earth.'' Some firms kept lists of so-called ``frequent
fliers,'' investors who bought small stakes in many companies and
were known to be willing to join class-action suits whenever stock
prices fell. One legendary class-action attorney was so feared in
corporate boardrooms that he was known simply as ``The Devil.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1995 law _ known as the Securities Litigation Reform Act _
was meant to get rid of the worst suits by requiring shareholder
lawyers to cite specific abuses at a company, not just that stock
prices fell.
</P>
<P>
   Most industry observers say it accomplished that. But critics
bitterly point out that the law also inadvertantly opened the door
for more suits with a provision requiring shareholder lawyers to
publish the fact they were bringing a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   By publishing on the Internet instead of newspapers, something
Congress didn't anticipate, attorneys have drawn thousands of
investors to class-action suits.
</P>
<P>
   With such huge classes, shareholder attorneys say, they've found
new clout in the suits they file, contributing to a trend toward
ever-larger settlements.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of power in numbers,'' says Michael Lange,
another partner at Berman DeValerio &AMP; Pease, where the average
settlement is now nearly $10 million, double the average amount
five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet also has enabled shareholder lawyers to operate
with unprecedented speed. With slick Web sites and chat rooms for
disgruntled investors, lawyers can identify a suspect company,
collect information for a detailed complaint, and assemble a class
of thousands of investors in a matter of days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has revolutionized our practice,'' DeValerio says. ``We are
able to receive information and disseminate it at a speed that
would have been unheard of before. The ability to find evidence of
fraud is much easier today than it used to be. Shareholders do a
lot of investigating themselves and post this stuff on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, when we see a substantial decline in a stock price, we
can know in a few hours whether we've got a situation where we can
take an action.''
</P>
<P>
   Shareholder attorneys have pounced at the first sign of an
earnings restatement, a move they say they interpret as practically
an admission of accounting fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much of it out there right now, certainly more than
anything in my lifetime,'' says Pease.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most recent examples, Berman DeValerio &AMP; Pease
scurried to file a suit against Pegasystems Inc. after the
Cambridge, Mass. software company last year announced earnings
revisions that revealed profits to be lower than it previously
announced.
</P>
<P>
   A string of accounting revisions since then contributed to a
long, precipitous slide in the company's stock price from 30 to 4
1/4. Last month, the Nasdaq Stock Market halted trading for five
hours while market officials questioned the company about a federal
investigation into its accounting practices and trading in the
firm's stock.
</P>
<P>
   The suit is currently pending, and both sides refuse to discuss
it.
</P>
<P>
   While some companies have railed against law firms' predatory
actions in those cases, industry observers say that in those cases,
at least, the firms are serving as a check on bad company
practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is how the system is supposed to work,'' says Joseph A.
Grundfest, a professor at Stanford Law School and a former
commissioner of the US Securities and Exchange Commission. ``The
plaintiff's bar is made up of profit-seeking attorneys. They're out
to make money. Their job is to push the system as far as it will
go, and in those cases where they discourage a bad practice, the
system works.''

INCREASING WOMEN'S WORLD CUP PROFILE NOT A LOFTY GOAL

<P>
   Soccer players and fans say they want more media coverage of
their sport in the United States. I like soccer, but as I've told
you many times, I can see the sports future. So please excuse me as
I grab my megaphone and shout a few warnings to a noisy crowd of
soccer lovers:
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want the press/radio/TV coverage you're asking for .
. . Trust me; I am one of (itals)them(unitals) . . . Your sport is
fine the way it is . . . Just be grateful that you don't have to .
. .''
</P>
<P>
   I know. They don't hear me.
</P>
<P>
   The Women's World Cup will end Saturday in Pasadena, Calif.,
when the United States and China play for the gold at the Rose
Bowl. If 80,000 fans attend _ as expected _ Team USA will be able
to say that it took only six dates for it to draw more than 400,000
fans. Compare that with the sorry Montreal Expos, who have
attracted 386,695 masochists to 44 games.
</P>
<P>
   That's good, but it doesn't mean Americans have soccer in their
souls like the citizens of Brazil, Italy, and all of Africa. If you
care about futbol, you should be happy about that. Your sport is an
international force, gets decent American ratings in a
baseball-football-basketball-hockey culture, has eight million
young women playing the sport in the States, and has moderate (as
well as refreshing) media coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Still don't believe me, do you? Well, let's go to the future.
Let's see what Mia Hamm, Briana Scurry, coach Tony DiCicco, and the
rest of the Yanks would have to face if soccer were one of
America's Big Four . . .
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Scott: ``Now watch the crazy hops of goalkeeper Briana
Scurry in the 53rd minute against the Chinese. Boo-ya! Ma Yuanan,
coach of China, thinks his team has a goal, but Scurry makes the
ill save and goes Flipmode: Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma . . . Wooh-Hah! She
got y'all all in check! (itals)Ooooh, Ma-mi.(unitals) Don't hate
the player, hate the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Ryan (writing about the 50 greatest soccer players of all
time): ``If Earth were faced with a one-match, winner-take-all
soccer match against an alien invader, the loser going into
servitude for eternity, my first pick for our squad would be a
healthy _ I said healthy _ Michelle Akers, the ultimate control
tower at both ends of the pitch. Frankly, it's a very easy call.''
</P>
<P>
   John Sterling, the apoplectic New York announcer: ``Yankees win!
Thuhhhhhhhhhhhhh Yankees win!''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Vecsey: ``Well, Hannah, my sources tell me that if Tony
DiCicco can't win tonight or at least guide his team to a shootout,
he will be fired. There is a belief in the organization that Team
USA could average a whopping three goals per match if DiCicco
started energetic forward Shannon MacMillan.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fabulous Sports Babe: ``Hey, darlin'. Come on in here and
have a seat. For those who just joined us, I'm here with Team USA
midfielder Joy Fawcett. Now, sugar, we know you're a mother of two.
So there's been a lot of speculation out there. For the record, are
you pregnant again?''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Berman: ``Welcome to Women's World Cup prime time. Let's
start with Mia Hamm on the right side of the pitch. She . . . could
. . . go . . . all . . . the . . . but no, she passes to Julie `96
Degrees and Partly' Foudy. She . . . could . . . go . . . but no.
She sends a cross to Brandi `You Need Some Bleach To Remove That'
Chastain. She dishes to Michelle `A Mule and 40' Akers, who
scores.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben Wright: ``The reason women don't play soccer as effectively
as men is . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Ben Wright II: ``What I really said was . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Ben Wright III: ``Please forward my final paycheck to . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Keith Jackson: ``Brazil's Maravilha has the ball and . . .
FUMBLE!''
</P>
<P>
   Talk Radio Caller: ``I mean, we've been waiting for something to
happen with this team since 1918. I'm tired of hearing this
small-market garbage. Yeah, DiCicco is 98-8-7 in his career, but I
want to see him win the big one. If this team had No. 42 on the
pitch, we'd be able to compete with the Chinese and Brazilians
every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig Sager (interviewing a soccer lottery pick on draft night):
``Your boyfriend broke up with you; you left college after two
years because your family needed the money; you've been accused of
improper dealings with an agent. Tell me, how do you feel?''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Walters: ``How do you feel?''
</P>
<P>
   Roy Firestone: ``How do you feel?''
</P>
<P>
   Tim McCarver and Joe Morgan (in unison): ``This is how she feels
. . .''
</P>
<P>
   John Madden: ``Boom. Now let me circle Michelle Akers here.
She's on my All-Madden Team. Look at the scars on her knees. She's
one of the most physical soccer players I've ever seen. She's had
12 knee surgeries in 14 years. And she can still put the ball in
the upper 90, too. She was giving me the business before the match
because I don't have her rated high enough on my new soccer game,
`Madden 2000.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Walton: ``What a (itals)disgraceful(unitals) yellow card
against Elane of Brazil.''
</P>
<P>
   Robin Roberts: ``Now we go to Dick Vitale and his soccer report.
Dick?''
</P>
<P>
   Vitale: ``Mia, Mia! Even a one-eyed old man like me can see that
she's a Prime Time Player, baybee! She can mark, she can cross, she
can make her penalty kicks. Like Lionel Ritchie said, `All Night
Long,' bay-bee . . .''

SMALL-CAP, GLOBAL STOCKS BLOW PAST THE BLUE CHIPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mutual funds, the plain vanilla investment option in a world of
exotic temptations, might well be the most appetizing choice after
all. Recent fund returns are anything but bland.
</P>
<P>
   Investors gained a sizzling 10.2 percent with the average
domestic stock fund in the just-ended quarter, according to Lipper
Inc., the fund tracking firm. Smaller-stock funds, which had been
anemic for years, swelled double that amount.
</P>
<P>
   The harvest may be bitter for some investors. More than a few
Americans have turned up their noses at conservative,
professionally managed portfolios in recent months and plunged into
cyberinvesting, do-it-yourself stockpicking, and other riskier,
more exotic alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   But the recent returns bonanza, the product of a giant shift in
stock markets during the spring, is likely to alter investor tastes
again. While overall fund sales are still lean compared to those in
recent periods, investors are slowly coming back to the table,
according to recent data.
</P>
<P>
   ``People see the returns, and they want back in,'' said Carl
Wittnebert at Mutual Fund TrimTabs, a Santa Rosa, Calif., firm that
tracks how much money investors put into and take out of funds.
</P>
<P>
   In a dramatic shift, the US stock market has widened to give
more types of shares _ and the funds that invest in them _ bigger
gains. New faith in the surging US economy and a rebound in Asian
markets, as well as disillusionment with the high valuations of the
most popular stocks, are behind the transformation.
</P>
<P>
   The result: After several years in which funds exposed to a
handful of giant, household-name companies or flashy Internet
shares hogged all the returns, investors now face a feast of
plenty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest story last quarter was the broadening of the
market,'' said John Ballen, president of MFS Investment Management
in Boston, a large fund firm. ``This is a major reversal.''
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the changes, funds invested in small-company shares
rose a hefty 15.6 percent in the second quarter, whose three months
ended June 30. Those devoted to micro-cap stocks, or companies with
market capitalizations of less than $300 milllion, gained a
whopping 22 percent _ the best-performing domestic stock category.
</P>
<P>
   On the opposite end, funds that had garnered the lead position
in recent years slipped to the back burner. Growth funds focused on
large, fast-growing companies rose a comparatively low 7.1 percent.
And funds that mimic the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index _ still the
flavor of the moment among investors _ gained only 6.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Such returns, of course, are nothing to sneeze at, especially
when compared with the average domestic stock fund's skimpy 0.9
percent gain in the first quarter. Stock investors can historically
expect to gain around 10 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   The market's changes were captured in the performance of the
nation's most widely-held equity funds. Janus Twenty, a $24.9
billion fund devoted to large-caps and a top performer in recent
periods, lost 4.3 percent last quarter, one of only two funds among
the nation's 25 largest funds to lose money for the period. By
contrast, Fidelity Equity-Income, a $24.2 billion portfolio full of
so-called undervalued stocks that have been out of favor, gained
10.6 percent, one of the best performers among the behemoth funds.
</P>
<P>
   The white-hot performance of funds last quarter may light a
firecracker under the $5.8 trillion fund industry, a business with
more assets than bank savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
   After months in which Wall Street seemed to be telling investors
they should simply chase hot funds focused on blue chips, last
quarter's message is that diversification among types of funds
works.
</P>
<P>
   Total, or net, sales of long-term mutual funds, which do not
include short-term money-market portfolios, declined 45 percent to
$82.1 billion over the first five months of this year compared with
1998 levels, according to Financial Research Corp., a consulting
firm in Boston. The figures reflect gross sales minus sums
investors redeemed from funds.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are still buying funds, but they have also been
pulling cash out to buy individual stocks, often through Web-based
brokerages, or to spend profits on big-ticket consumer goods such
as homes and vacations.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, the phenomenon has constituted a rejection of the
principle of professionally managed money and of the buy-and-hold
strategy that had led millions of Americans to place retirement and
college savings in funds.
</P>
<P>
   But according to David Haywood, an industry analyst at Financial
Research, redemptions reflect not disenchantment with funds in an
era of flashy cyberbrokerages and Internet stocks, but confidence
that the market _ and stock portfolios _ will continue to perform
well. Investors, he said, feel confident that the bull market will
make up for any money cashed out.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, inflows into domestic equity funds in May, at $14.9
billion, were nearly even with May 1998, according to Financial
Research. And net sales for the second quarter were double the
previous quarter's $30 billion, according to estimates by TrimTabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody expected it, but the flows are picking up,'' said
TrimTabs' Wittnebert. ``The main factor is performance.''
</P>
<P>
   The hottest returns last quarter were for funds invested in
international stocks, a category battered in recent periods. Funds
invested in the Pacific region, but not Japan, gained 37.6 percent,
while emerging markets funds soared 24.9 percent. Portfolios
devoted to European stocks stood still, rising only 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There were other surprises. Natural resources funds gained 18.4
percent, bettering by more than four percentage points glitzy
science and technology funds.
</P>
<P>
   Among bond funds, returns were middling to unhappy. Domestic
long-term Treasury bond funds slipped 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the past years' worst investment categories are up,''
said Reginald Green, publisher of the Mutual Fund News Service
newsletter in Bodega Bay, Calif. ``And many investors are going to
learn from the last quarter that nothing lasts forever.''

   The song starts with a grooving techno-Afro beat. But it's the
words that follow that make you take notice of Missy Elliott's new
hip-hop single.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Elliott doesn't sling the b-word around in the misogynistic way
of her male hip-hop cohorts. Instead, Elliott reclaims it, making
it the description of choice for strong women. As Elliott, a
sought-after producer, songwriter, and performer, told Ms. magazine
in a recent interview, ``I became a bitch in power because when I
walked in, I asked for what I wanted. And at the end of the day, if
this is the way I want it, this is the way I'm going to have it.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott isn't the only person embracing the b-word these days.
After a new wave of feminists dragged it back into the public
lexicon in the early 1990s, the once-vitriolic term that some
people still have trouble uttering has gone the mainstream path of
``hell'' and ``damn.''
</P>
<P>
   Turn on the telly and you're likely to hear it slip out of
someone's mouth. It was the punch line of a joke in the film
``Armageddon'' and a rude term of endearment bandied about by the
male friends in ``Good Will Hunting.''
</P>
<P>
   A group of female legislators in Washington state feistily call
themselves Mean Old Bitches. A recent book by Elizabeth Wurtzel and
a 'zine are both called ``Bitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Peruse the newsstands and you'll find Honey, a new magazine for
young African-American women that boldly named its column for
unsigned female artists ``Bitches Brew.'' And a year before
Elliott's ``She's a Bitch'' hit the radio airwaves, the masses
exuberantly sang along to Meredith Brooks's bluntly titled pop song
``Bitch.''
</P>
<P>
   The word's broad acceptance follows a well-worn path of
reclamation. Homosexuals have done it with ``queer,'' lesbians with
``dyke,'' feminists with ``girl,'' and African-Americans with the
n-word.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the people out there in the culture using (the word
``bitch'') are doing it in the way that fat people make fat jokes
or Margaret Cho makes Asian jokes,'' says Amelia Richards, 29,
cofounder of Third Wave, the New York-based national organization
of young feminist activists. ``It's done, I think, from a position
of power.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a broad-based cultural embracement of the word is bound to
have an impact on young women. Take, for example, the girls gustily
rapping along with Elliott's ``She's a Bitch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was 21 . . . I would be thinking that Missy is about the
coolest chick in the universe,'' says Danyel Smith, who is in fact
34 and the editor in chief of the hip-hop magazine Vibe. ``And I
would think `If she's using it and it's no big deal to her, then
it's no big deal to me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Yet for some it is still a big deal. As with those other words,
not everyone mouthing the derogatory term uses it in a positive
manner. Despite explanations from Elliott, Brooks, and company, the
b-word still summons up images of not only a powerful woman, but a
cruel or sexually aggressive one. And those are just some of the
nicer meanings.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's like a woman's trip,'' says Joan Morgan, 34, author of
``When Chickenheads Come Home to Roost: My Life as a Hip-Hop
Feminist,'' published in March. ``I don't think that we can then
make the leap that it's really going to change or impact the way
that men see and use the word. The word is firmly embedded in the
lexicon of male language that's used to disparage women.''
</P>
<P>
   Richards agrees. ``The problem is when context is missing,'' she
says. ``There are still too many people out there that use `queer,'
that use `girl,' that use `bitch' in a context that is not only
negative and woman-hating but also potentially dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Negativity isn't the goal of the Washington state
representatives, senators, lobbyists, and staff members who call
themselves Mean Old Bitches. In fact, members offended by the
b-word simply call themselves Mean Old Broads.
</P>
<P>
   But broad is not the name their opponents use when complaining
about the tenacious female politicians. Since the early 1990s, MOB
members have used their humorous moniker to soften those digs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hear stories coming back that we're called these names
because we're willing to stand up and take the body blows,'' says
state Rep. Karen Schmidt, 53, who was given her MOB pin six or
seven years ago after a bitter legislative battle over a
transportation issue. ``If you think of it on the negative side,
it's going to depress you. If you make it positive, it kind of
makes you smile. And you do need to smile about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Years ago women would never laugh off that term. For centuries
the word described a female dog or was a vicious put-down aimed at
someone considered ``excessively'' sexual women. By the 20th
century, people had also adapted the word to describe a malicious
woman.
</P>
<P>
   Gay men were the first to use it in a positive way, says Camille
Paglia, the controversial self-described feminist who claims to
have ``legitimized the word bitch'' in the 1990s. In the 1960s gay
men ``would say admiringly of Barbra Streisand, `She's such a
bitch.' I loved their usage of that,'' says Paglia.
</P>
<P>
   The word began seeping into the mainstream in the 1970s. Elton
John applied the word to himself in 1974 in his song ``The Bitch Is
Back.'' And R &AMP; B fans got an earful of it when Millie Jackson
released her 1977 album ``Feelin' Bitchy.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such inroads, it continued to be a pejorative term.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one would ever laughingly refer to a . . .'' says Barbara
Smith, 52, a feminist author who still can't bring herself to do
more than allude to or spell out the word. ``I mean amongst friends
perhaps, but it would not ever be a public assertion and you
certainly would never have heard it on television.''
</P>
<P>
   These days it's not surprising to hear the word slipped into a
Jay Leno monologue or voiced by one of the cop characters on ``NYPD
Blue,'' usually in a spiteful way. And cable _ it definitely goes
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same thing happened with `hell' and `damn,' '' says
Morgan. ``I think that as words become used throughout the culture
more broadly, their impact and shock value tend to decrease.''
</P>
<P>
   Richards gives a good example of how the term for female dog has
lost its teeth. A few years ago she remembers chastising a woman
who used it with ease. These days Richards thinks it's such a
catchall word, she hardly says it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't want to be sisterly to a woman,'' says Richards,
``I'd probably find a lot harsher words to be using or a lot more
honest words because I do think the word has a generic
connotation.''
</P>
<P>
   It's so generic, women can hear hip-hop artists such as Ma

MERGED BANKS MUST RENEW COMMITMENT TO COMMUNITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the economic scheme of things, The Federal Reserve board of
governors plays the College of Cardinals to Alan Greenspan's Pope.
</P>
<P>
   Where he leads, they must follow, unless massive rebellion
overwhelms collegiality, which is exceedingly rare, as heretics
don't get promoted to the rank of cardinal. So when the Federal
Reserve convenes a public meeting Wednesday (July 7) on the merger
of Fleet Bank and BankBoston, there will be a predisposition to
approve the confluence of New England's two largest banks.
</P>
<P>
   Because to shoot it down, on one pretext or another, would
disrupt the glacial momentum of consolidation in the finance
industry. Banking regulators are no more powerful against economic
tides than are shorefront property owners glumly regarding waves
eroding their beachfront. You can make a little difference here or
there, toss in some rip-rap, but in the end, the tides win.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a line of local worthies lining up to support the
big bank merger, and there will be the opponents, whose realisitic
intent is not so much to prevent the inevitable, but to extract a
pound of flesh for this cause or that. Wresting financial
commitments from merger-bound bank executives is one of the final
hurdles. Then comes the Justice Department's OK of the plan to
auction off bank branches to pare the new colossus down to the
requirements of the antitrust diet.
</P>
<P>
   Like the oldest oak in the forest, BankBoston, the direct lineal
descendant of the first bank in this country, is about ready to
fall. The bank which enabled colonial New England to find its
fiscal feet is being merged into Fleet, the regional powerhouse
assembled by Terry Murray.
</P>
<P>
   As Brian Mooney sketched with awesome specificity in Saturday's
Globe, BankBoston will become the 451st stand-alone bank to be
swallowed in the Fleet maw. There were quaintly-titled itty-bitty
outfits like Orange National, Worcester Mechanics, Workingmen's
Cooperative, First National of Winchendon, and larger chunks, Bank
of New England, Shawmut and BayBanks.
</P>
<P>
   The banking business has changed. Consolidation is the rule.
ATMs replace tellers, on-line banking displaces passbooks, credit
and debit cards displace checkbooks. To buy the computers and
tekkies to run them, banks need to get bigger. It's dog-eat-dog,
and the bigger dog always wins. If it wasn't Fleet absorbing
BankBoston, it would have been one of the giants to our south or
west. To many in business, the devil they know (Fleet-BankBoston)
is preferable to the out-of-region devils they don't know.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Congress seems serious about obliterating the
Glass-Stegall barriers between banks, brokerage houses and
insurance companies, the pressure to get bigger is even greater.
But the absorption of BankBoston has one potential downside. Even
before Chad Gifford took over BankBoston, that outfit had an
outstanding national reputation for community involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Murray is expected to match that. So his executives have crafted
a plan to commit $14.6 billion over five years for projects that
require more banking leeway than a cold-eyed credit check. ``We are
commiting to keep the spigot going for the next five years the way
it's been open for the past three, at the peak of the economic
cycle,'' said Jim Mahony, a Fleet executive.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet is bankrolling a study by MassInc. that was requested by
Cardinal Bernard Law to examine ways to increase the housing supply
in Massachusetts. The Cardinal's point man on affordable housing is
Msgr. Michael Groden, who runs the Archdiocese Planning Office for
Urban Affairs. The big bank merger coincides with the archdiocese
``trying to fashion new mechanisms to create affordable housing for
low and moderate income families, the elderly and those with
special needs,'' said Groden. The problem now is not mortgage
money, but lowering the ever-escalating costs of housing to
increase supply.
</P>
<P>
   Groden said his talks with Mahony dwelt on ``new strategies such
as equity instruments that can reduce the cost to the buyer or
renter, thereby creating a greater range and depth of
affordability.'' He said the pair ``focused on several major
housing developments presently on the drawing board.'' He added
``they include one major family development and several assisted
living programs which would provide a majority of the units to low
and moderate income elderly.'' One of them is a 100-unit
assisted-living development proposed for the St. John of God
hospital grounds in Brighton.
</P>
<P>
   Mahony said Msgr. Groden broached the notion of so-called
``patient money,'' that would have the merged banks commit certain
sums up front to reduce the cost of an apartment, with the bank
waiting for repayment. ``We've been working with the Cardinal on
affordable housing. His hypothesis is we need more on the supply
side, the supply is so tight that prices are high.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahony said ``What Mike Groden and others like Tom Callahan at
the Massachusetts Affordable Housing Alliance do, this is their
life, creating affordable housing, and improving living conditions
for people. We have a great deal of respect for them, and will be
working with them as partners. We don't have the infrastructure to
develop affordable housing, that's what Mike Groden does, so we'll
work with him.''

NEW BULGER IS BASKING IN LIMELIGHT OF UMASS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- As makeovers go, it's not the new Nixon of 1968, or
even the new Dukakis of 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in its own way, this transformation is fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   The new Bulger.
</P>
<P>
   During his 17 years as president of the Massachusetts Senate,
William M. Bulger was reviled outside of the narrow confines of his
district and Beacon Hill.
</P>
<P>
   But no more. Bulger has assumed a softer public persona, thanks
to his more than three years as the University of Massachusetts
president.
</P>
<P>
   That has become evident in the university's own survey, taken
late last month. It shows the public's view of UMass has jumped
dramatically since Bulger took over in early 1996. Nearly
two-thirds of those surveyed think UMass provides a
good-to-excellent quality of education. In early 1996, only 46
percent expressed those feelings.
</P>
<P>
   The university's new standing with the public seems to have
spilled over personally to Bulger who, now far from the nasty
political wars at the State House, regularly generates positive
media coverage for himself.
</P>
<P>
   No longer the lightning rod for liberals, reformers,
Republicans, and term-limit proponents, Bulger is announcing
popular programs and appearing in upbeat ads promoting UMass, while
staying far way from any bad news that comes out of the system. He
has raised the endowment and academic standards at the university,
and cut tuitions three years in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Even a hefty pay raise the board of trustees gave him earlier
this year _ hiking his salary to nearly $300,000 from $189,000 _
failed to spark much public outrage.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, the late Paul Tsongas, the former US senator, pegged it
right when Bulger's name first surfaced as a candidate for the
UMass job. ``This is one of those ideas that is either going to be
a phenomenal success or a phenomenal failure,'' Tsongas said.
</P>
<P>
   For many in the higher education field, the first half of
Tsongas' take on the appointment has proven true.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it has worked out fabulously,'' said Daniel A. Taylor,
a Boston lawyer and former UMass trustee. ``He has a steadfast
focus on how to build a great state university.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not out of the ordinary for an official's image to change.
Richard Nixon craftily reinvented himself for his successful 1968
presidential race. And Michael Dukakis won back the governorship
from Edward King in 1982 after convincing voters he was a new,
humble, more mellow figure ready to listen.
</P>
<P>
   Bulger's transformation has not taken place in those starkly
political terms. No one is even speculating that he craves a return
to politics.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his success at UMass is a personal triumph for the former
legislative leader who often hissed at the media and appeared as a
petty, iron-fisted martinet with his opponents on Beacon Hill.
During his long State House career, he often seemed a dark,
brooding figure, defining much of the world according to his
experiences in Boston's busing crises and fending off challenges to
his integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who as counsel for former governor Michael Dukakis had
worked with Bulger on Beacon Hill, said Bulger's public image
transformation does not surprise him. The media had attributed to
the South Boston lawmaker a reputation that he did not deserve,
Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   The positive numbers in the university's McCormack Institute
survey also reflect Bulger's ability to survive _ even thrive _ in
a highly politicized state public education world that buffeted two
of his conservative colleagues, James Carlin, chairman of the Board
of Higher Education, and John Silber, chairman of the Board of
Education. The trio had been the choices of then-governor William
F. Weld to shake up the state's education establishment.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, Carlin, citing health reasons, stepped down;
friends say he was frustrated by his battles, some of them with his
old friend Bulger. Silber left last winter in the middle of an
angry public storm he helped create. He threw himself on his sword
after he and Governor Paul Cellucci couldn't secure their candidate
as the new education commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   But Bulger endures. Not only that, but in a development that
defies all the predictions when he was appointed, he has won the
warm approval of the very people who opposed his appointment.
</P>
<P>
   That speaks to Bulger's leadership style. Throughout his career,
his first instinct has always been to protect whatever institution
he is a part of, be it South Boston or the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   That's how he succeeded on Beacon Hill. By using his charm and
political skills, he retained the loyalty of his colleagues, so
much so that he was able to beat back a reform challenge from
then-senator William Keating in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a different story among the public. Bulger's worst
period in office came a decade ago, when he was nearly devoured in
a media feeding frenzy over the 75 State Street controversy. A
Globe poll showed his favorable rating was an abysmal 15 percent,
his job performance rating, even worse, at 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference a decade makes. One source said a private poll
taken for an education group has placed his approval rating well
above 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The public's warmer feelings about the university can be traced
to several factors. Clearly, the first surge came after the
university basketball team made the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   An expensive television ad campaign that Bulger's office aired
also helped. The ads have saturated the airways for more than a
year, with prominent university graduates _ entertainer Bill Cosby,
General Motors chief executive John Smith, and General Electric top
chief, John Welch _ touting the university.
</P>
<P>
   The ads end with Bulger, surrounded by smiling students, saying,
``Let us be part of your success story.''
</P>
<P>
   But the turnaround may be more than a public relations gimmick.
Bulger gets credit for hiking fund-raising by 77 percent. The
Amherst campus has risen to 59 on the U.S. News and World Report
rankings. The SAT scores and grade-point averages of incoming
students are up.
</P>
<P>
   He also has increased UMass's cachet by offering full
scholarships to the top two academic achievers at each of the
state's high schools.
</P>
<P>
   The board of trustees chose Bulger, the politician, after a long
string of mostly out-of-state academics tried and failed to lead
the university. It was risky. But if UMass's own polls are correct,
the public feels the risk was well worth it.

FOR THE REST OF '99: LET THE GOOD TIMES ROLL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like the Red Sox, the American economy and stock market had a
much better first half of the year than anyone expected. As the
second half of the year begins, the obvious question to ask is: Can
the good times continue or will something come along to burst our
bubble?
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to remember, but as 1999 began, the outlook for the
year was decidedly mediocre. And why not? The US economy had just
completed its third straight year of roughly 4 percent growth, a
performance that dramatically exceeded all forecasts. With the
world economy in trouble, the betting was the United States could
not remain ``an oasis of prosperity'' as Federal Reserve chairman
Alan Greenspan so elegantly put it.
</P>
<P>
   Back in December, the forecasters at DRI Standard &AMP; Poor's in
Lexington, Mass. predicted growth of 2.1 percent in the first half
of this year _ basically a return to something like the norm.
</P>
<P>
   Expectations for the stock market were much the same. The market
had just turned in its fourth straight year of 20 percent or better
returns, an unprecedented string of good fortune. Investors needed
to set their sights lower, the strategists said.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 13 percent as of
Tuesday; the Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq index were
up more than 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even better from an investor's point of view, the strength in
the stock market in the first half was broad-based. Technology
stocks did well, but so did small-cap stocks and stocks of basic
industrial companies. Aluminum maker Alcoa, a company no one will
confuse with an Internet high-flier, has seen its stock price rise
70 percent over the past four months.
</P>
<P>
   What explains the market's strong showing? ``What was supposed
to be an average economic year has turned out to be another stellar
year,'' says Mark Zandi, chief economist at Regional Financial
Associates, a Pennsylvania forecasting firm.
</P>
<P>
   When the final numbers are tallied, economists now expect the US
economy will have grown at a 4 percent pace in the first half of
the year. Zandi and others say they were wrong because they
anticipated that weak economies in Asia and Latin America would act
as a brake on the United States. Instead those economies recovered
surprisingly quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Investors and consumers breathed a collective sigh of relief at
the news and the good times continued. ``People still feel great
about things,'' says Maureen Allyn,'' chief economist at Scudder
Kemper Investments, a mutual fund company.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation did tick up a bit in the first six months of the year
and the Federal Reserve last week boosted interest rates slightly.
But when the Fed signaled that it saw no immediate need for more
rate hikes, investors read it as a sign that the party isn't over
yet.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Freedman says some of that optimism may be justified. An
executive at John Hancock Funds, Freedman likes what he sees ahead.
``I am still very upbeat on this economy,'' he says. ``And as long
as interest rates don't go to the moon, I think the market should
be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters now expect solid growth for the second half of the
year as consumers keep spending and companies keep investing. Most
analysts see some slowing as the year progresses, in part because
of higher interest rates, especially on home mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   Under the best of circumstances, the economy will grow fast
enough to keep corporate earnings on track but not so fast as to
trigger higher inflation and more Federal Reserve rate hikes. Call
it the best of all worlds scenario.
</P>
<P>
   What could upset this rosy forecast?
</P>
<P>
   One possibility is a growing concern about stock market
valuations. At the moment the stock market is trading at a
price/earnings ratio of 31, the highest of all time. A high
price/earnings ratio indicates optimism about future earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Allyn says some of the rise in the ratio can be explained by
hard numbers. ``But you can't explain the whole thing on
fundamentals,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   David Wyss, chief economist at DRI, makes a similar case. His
model of the stock market, which is based on interest rates and
earnings, currently shows stocks to be 32 percent overvalued. Says
Wyss, ``The question is: Is this a bubble or has something
fundamentally changed?''
</P>
<P>
   If it is a bubble and that bubble should burst, the results
could be bad for both the stock market and the economy, say
analysts. Greenspan and others say part of the economy's strength
has been fed by the strong stock market. Should the market fall,
the economy could weaken, which in turn, could drag the market
lower still. Put simply, what went up together could go down
together too.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, most forecasters think the greatest danger to the
market and the economy is not weakness, but too much strength.
Their arguments goe something like this:
</P>
<P>
   If the economy keeps going like gangbusters, the Federal Reserve
will feel compelled to hike interest rates _ not once or twice, but
a series of times. So far the stock market has been able to shake
off a rise in rates. But should rates rise enough, say forecasters,
the market would swoon, much as it did back in 1994, the last time
the Fed boosted rates significantly.
</P>
<P>
   Given their recent track record, most economists and market
strategists are a bit humble about predicting the future. And if
they do get it wrong again, they hope they goof the way they have
for the past four years _ by being too pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really isn't a bad time to be a forecaster,'' says
Nicholas Perna, chief economist at Fleet Financial Group. ``When
things turn out better than you predicted, people don't get mad at
you.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE RED HERRING
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Back in February, Chris Felipe and John Brennan, two very hot
money managers, said goodbye to MFS Investment Management, the
Boston mutual fund firm.
</P>
<P>
   The pair weren't angry. They just wanted to start _ what else? _
a hedge fund.
</P>
<P>
   Just over four months later, the hedge fund is open for
business. The company, called Sirios Capital Management, has raised
more than $500 million from investors, say those close to the firm.
The fund will invest in mid-cap and large-cap domestic stocks and
will take short positions in some stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Felipe and Brennan Tuesday declined to comment on their new
venture.

   Until two weeks ago, when Diana Flynn was teaching, she rose
early, headed out to school, then worked the fields until dark. Now
she's outside all day. She got her organic certification last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   She also makes breads and cookies to bring along to the farmers'
markets. A walnut-scallion baguette is popular, she says. Some of
her baked goods go to the local health food store.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put myself on a schedule. I bake two times a week. It's
difficult working full time and trying to get things
accomplished,'' she says, passing by an outdoor table where
seedlings are still waiting to be planted. ``Most of these are
flowers. And flowers are at the bottom of the list.''
</P>
<P>
   Flynn began going to farmers' markets as soon as school was out.
In June, she was still trying to establish a routine for all the
bits and pieces a market entails: enough ice to keep the highly
perishable produce _ like lettuce and kale _ cool all day; plastic
bags for customers; a little something to give away so she could
chat with the customers. Throughout June, her giveaway was garlic
stems. Shoppers who bought something else got a few tucked into
their sack, with an explanation on how to slice them down to the
flower and add them to a pan of sauteed vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   In the first weeks, she brought chard and lettuce to the market,
along with snap peas and snow peas. She picked flowers and
fashioned little $1 bouquets. Later in the season she'll sell
golden and red raspberries, endive, radicchio, mesclun salad mix,
bee balm, lovage, bulbs of fresh garlic, yellow and purple beans,
hot and sweet peppers, eggplant, summer squash and zucchini, and
little yellow cukes. In the fall she'll have winter squash and
pumpkins.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn has heard about growers driving into Boston and earning
hundreds of dollars in one afternoon, but her operation is so small
now she might not have the inventory. Her little farm stand outside
her house opens on Friday for the weekend. Her biggest take at
market now is around $100, and she pays about $40 for a seasonal
market fee.
</P>
<P>
   She tried selling at a market in Chicopee and was disappointed
that it was held at the edge of a mall parking lot. She brought
home $30. A few days later, in Holyoke, her spot was at the end of
the short row of trucks. That meant less revenue because customers
don't want to walk the length of the market. On two recent trips to
Holyoke, she made $45, then $57.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets to you. Today I didn't leave home until noon. I was up
at 7, picking, then driving 40 minutes, setting up, packing in.
Say, from 8 in the morning until 6 at night. That's a 10-hour day.
You have to figure your gas cost, your livelihood cost. I was very
frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyoke, whose market is held Thursday afternoons, has a large
Hispanic population. Flynn says that being organic isn't an
advantage there. But she's staying. She'll try to do the
Springfield market on Wednesdays, which would give her two markets
a week. ``I don't have enough stuff to do Wednesday, Thursday, and
Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   For each market, she has to come up with the annual fee, plus $7
every time she brings her truck. The Holyoke market manager, who is
also a grower, comes over to collect her annual fee. ``Seven for
today,'' he says. ``And the 40 next week?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, of course,'' she answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't forget,'' he says, too sternly. ``Forty next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Flynn nods. The manager notices a reporter nearby taking notes.
``Next week,'' he says. Then, hesitating, ``or the week after.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, when Flynn was feeling dispirited and too far away
from her family, her mother came east to cheer her up. Terry Flynn,
who runs an auto-body shop in Vista, Calif., says, ``She's always
been a family girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Diana Flynn says her friends wonder when she'll grow up ``and
live my own life.'' She says, ``You never outgrow your need for
your family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a great childhood,'' she says. When she was young, her
parents owned a ranch they named Rancho Poco a Poco (Ranch Little
by Little). Everything got done in its time, she says. ``Me and my
brother would pack up a lunch and go horseback riding all day on a
Saturday. It was open country. A lot of it was orchards.'' She
laughs now, remembering the two kids charging through the fruit
trees on their horses. ``We had to duck so we wouldn't ride into
the cobwebs. Those were the days you could be gone all day and no
one would worry.''
</P>
<P>
   Her parents divorced when she was 11. For high school, she
boarded at Cheshire Academy in Cheshire, Conn. (class of '85), then
returned to California, where she attended four junior colleges.
When she was 21, she came east again to go to Holyoke Community
College. Eventually, she graduated from California State University
at Chico, with a major in environmental education. Afterward, she
went to Guatemala, which really worried her parents. ``She was down
there for four months, and we weren't very happy,'' says Terry
Flynn. Then she went to work on an organic farm. ``My parents
thought I was crazy,'' Diana Flynn says.
</P>
<P>
   She was raised by a mother who also wasn't afraid of hard work.
After the divorce, Terry Flynn took over the auto-body shop she and
her husband had run together. ``Talk about a man's business,'' says
Diana Flynn. ``A lot of people are surprised that she succeeded
because no (woman) had.''
</P>
<P>
   Flynn is sitting cross-legged alongside a row of lettuce,
pulling out weeds and letting them drop back onto the soil so
they'll work as mulch. Lee Warren is in the hayfield. Kristopher
Fournier is dashing all around. In places, the weeds look taller
and grander than the greens. ``If you don't time it right, you get
a mess of weeds,'' Flynn says. The afternoon is hot and she hasn't
brought water out to the fields, so she has to walk back to the
house to get a cold drink. Then back outside to weed some more.
</P>
<P>
   She's bent over, and her glasses have tipped down to the end of
her nose. In the hot sun, she moves slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poco a poco,'' she says.

BLODGETT SET TO HELP COACH BU HOOP TEAM

<P>
   When Margaret McKeon was named new women's basketball coach at
Boston University last April, she promised to kickstart the
stuggling program. She's not wasting any time.
</P>
<P>
   Maine graduate and WNBA player Cindy Blodgett appears to be the
latest addition to the Terriers' staff, according to the Bangor
Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Tuesday how things stand in relation to the reported move,
McKeon said, ``They stand quite well.''
</P>
<P>
   Although no deal is official yet, McKeon acknowledged that she's
heard a lot about Blodgett and her accomplishments ever since
McKeon attended a basketball camp in Maine at Colby College.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had heard of Cindy, she was always mentioned,'' said McKeon.
``Then when I coached at George Washington, we played Maine twice.
We beat them both times, but she played quite well. And she was
player of the year in this conference (America East) three times.''
</P>
<P>
   McKeon said she's heard more good things about Blodgett from
Maura McHugh, as assistant coach at the Sacramento Monarchs _
McKeon was as assistant coach at Arizona State in 1987 when McHugh
was head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Blodgett, who was drafted by the Cleveland Rockers last year,
was traded to the Sacramento Monarchs in May. She's been averaging
1.5 points, one steal and 4.3 minutes per game, and had no points
in the Monarchs' 76-63 loss to the New York Liberty Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Since the WNBA season is from June through August, Blodgett
could coach during the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   McKeon said she's convinced adding a player of Blodgett's
stature to BU's staff would mean a lot to the Terriers, who
finished with 5-22 last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make sure people know we are serious about
basketball at BU, and I think this would send a message,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Trade is off
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In other WNBA news, the trade of UConn alum Kara Wolters from
the Houston Comets to the Charlotte Sting has been voided. Wolters
was to go to that team in return for center Rhonda Mapp. But after
Wolters underwent an MRI at her physical, Sting physicians
determined that she had patellar tendonitis in her right knee.
Since Charlotte wouldn't be able to immediately activate Wolters,
the trade was called off . . . Smith College will host the 50th
anniversary conference of the International Association of Physical
Education and Sport for Girls and Women through Saturday. The
association, founded by Smith graduate Dorothy Ainsworth, now has
members in more than 40 countries. This will be only the second
time the summit will be held in the US. Jill Ker Conway, former
Smith president and a director of the Nike Corporation, was to give
the keynote address Wednesday at 6 p.m. at Sage Hall.

ON THE RUN _ FOR 100 MILES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHFIELD, Mass. _ Mary Kate Shea would like to bike across the
country. Take off for four months and hike the Appalachian Trail.
Do something long, arduous, adventurous.
</P>
<P>
   However, Shea has four children who need to be shuttled to
hockey practice, soccer games, dance lessons. There are muffins to
be baked, swings to be pushed, cartwheels to be admired, hugs to be
handed out, tears to be dried.
</P>
<P>
   So, at least for now, the 37-year-old wife, mother, Sunday
school teacher and freelance writer will have to concentrate on
something she considers more manageable: a 100-mile run.
</P>
<P>
   Observed a friend, Madeline Gaughran: ``I shudder to think what
her next goal might be.''
</P>
<P>
   To most people, the idea of running 100 miles _ the distance
between Boston and Hartford _ falls somewhere between outlandish
and out of the question. The idea of getting ready to run 100 miles
while taking care of four busy children between the ages of 4 and
12 falls somewhere even beyond that. But to Shea, a lifelong
athlete known among her friends and family as physically strong,
mentally tough and amazingly organized, it seems a perfect _ if
ambitious _ fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no need to settle,'' Shea said. ``You can be happy
with your life, have your children, have your work, and still want
to set goals that challenge you physically _ and, in this case,
mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge will officially begin at 4 a.m. on July 17, when
Shea steps off from the still-dark starting line of the Vermont 100
Mile Endurance Race in South Woodstock. With any luck, it will end
about 24 hours, 15,000 feet of ascent, 15,000 more feet of descent
and several successful medical checks later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be a huge mental thing,'' said Shea, who
quickly corrected herself. ``I know it's going to be a huge mental
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Shea shrugs off what many would see as the equally daunting
challenge of eking out time to train amid tending to Patrick, 12,
Richie, 10, Kate, 8, and Erin, 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having the kids,'' she said, ``you can never look at it as
saying I have to do this, this and this. It's more like, what do I
have the opportunity to do? What can you do with what you have? And
what I have is four kids.''
</P>
<P>
   That what she does is exceptional doesn't seem to dawn on her,
perhaps because she comes from a Weymouth family of nine children
that includes a sister who played rugby at Bowdoin and a brother
who played professional lacrosse, the latter of whom once stopped
to eat a burger in the middle of running the Boston Marathon. If
they take her 100-mile plans in stride (``Have fun,'' was the sole
reaction of another brother, who has climbed mountains in South
America), why shouldn't she?
</P>
<P>
   So, she trains on the treadmill after the kids have gone to bed.
During the school year, she gets her long runs in during the week.
Now that it's summer, she does them on the weekends. When her
husband, Richard, gets home from work, she heads out the door.
Running four or five days a week, Shea averages 45 miles most
weeks, and has gotten in as many as 70.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to give it the priority it deserves,'' said her
husband, who among other support efforts has taken over all
Saturday-morning duties. ``She'll always be trying to put (the
children) first, but she has to be sure to cover her own needs as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Training partner Rich Boretti of the Marshfield Road Runners,
who is preparing for his third Vermont 100-miler, said Shea
shouldn't worry about not being able to run more. ``The key is
doing a long run, and she does at least a three-hour run on
weekends,'' he said. ``That's really the key, just being out on
your feet. I'm really amazed she does the training she does. Most
people who run in the ultras are in their 40s and don't have kids.
There are very few moms who do it.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't surprise Gaughran, a runner who has three young boys
of her own. ``It's almost like you could never picture Mary Kate
having (just) one or two children, because that wouldn't be
challenging enough,'' she said. ``She's got to have five balls to
juggle.''
</P>
<P>
   An 800-meter runner in her days at Holy Cross who last year
finished the Boston Marathon in 3 hours, 33 minutes, Shea joined
the Marshfield running club in spring 1997, having moved back to
Massachusetts after 12 years following her husband's military
career to Germany, Virginia, and Texas. It was there she met
Boretti and others who had already done the Vermont race. These
people are crazy, she thought. But soon enough, she was talked into
trying a 50-mile race last October, which turned into 50-plus miles
when she got a little lost. Despite the detour, she finished in 10
hours, 40 minutes _ well under the 12-hour qualifying time required
by the Vermont 100 _ and loved it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember thinking, this will be the longest race I'll ever
run,'' said Shea, who was especially taken with the cooperative
spirit of the event compared to shorter races. ``Then, at the end,
I'm running fast, thinking 100 miles is doable.''
</P>
<P>
   Step by step, it has all come together. If she is worried, she
is, typically, keeping it to herself (``She makes the best of any
situation,'' said Gaughran, ``whether it's a dreadful situation or
a wonderful one''). As she tapers her workouts with the race
approaching, she reflects on training runs where everything has
been in tune, fluid, effortless _ the days when she felt she could
just run for hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which,'' she laughs suddenly, ``is what I'm going to have to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, and amusingly, Shea is already looking beyond the
100-miler. As if the Vermont race isn't challenge enough for one
summer, next month she and Gaughran will pack their seven children
into a couple of cars and drive to Montana, where Gaughran's
parents will babysit while the women compete in a strenuous trail
run that reaches an altitude of 9,600 feet above sea level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's only like 23 miles,'' said Shea, ``so it's a
short race.''

`24-7' ECONOMY IS RESHAPING EMPLOYEE WORK SCHEDULES

 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is 4:20 a.m. when currency strategist Paul Podolsky sets out
for work on his 18-speed bike, entering Boston's Financial District
before the sun's first rays.
</P>
<P>
   His colleague Jeremy Fand, a 33-year-old senior foreign exchange
strategist at BankBoston, has already been on the telephone since 4
a.m. Long before the rush-hour commute begins, the two men, who
work a 5 a.m. to 3 p.m. shift, are monitoring fluctuations in the
dollar, the euro, and the yen.
</P>
<P>
   Over at Thompson Financial, computer operator Bill Thornton is
nearing the end of the 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. shift he works three days a
week, hours he says eliminate day care worries and costs.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by globalization and supported by new technology and a
booming economy, US businesses from retailers to investment houses
are now operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week. For many
white-collar professionals, that means working new shifts geared to
the 24-7 operation.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, say specialists, these nontraditional shift
workers include service employees with professional, technical,
clerical, or supervisory positions in law, retail sales, computer
operations, or finance.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is catching on. About 25 million US workers have
nontraditional hours, says the Washington-based National Sleep
Foundation. Of those, 3.2 million have full-time night jobs, up
from 3 million in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports the proportion of the
nation's 106.5 million work force with flexible schedules is 27.6
percent, up from 15.1 percent in 1991. Furthermore, 21.4 million
working Americans _ about one in five _ are now shift workers.
</P>
<P>
   Clark University sociologist Robert J.S. Ross attributes the
shift change to globalization, around-the-clock computing, and an
increase in the use of flex time.
</P>
<P>
   A tight labor market and a keen interest in holding on to
valuable employees are prompting some employers to design work
shifts that fit their companies' needs while also allowing
employees to attend to personal and family needs, said Ross.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain institutions have always operated 24 hours a day,'' he
said. ``What we are seeing now is a growth in those kind of
operations in industries other than manufacturing.''
</P>
<P>
   Office supply superstore chain Staples launched 17 new stores in
March, all 24-hour operations. Many supermarket chains, copy
centers, retailers, express mail services, and legal institutions
are riding the 24-7 bandwagon in an attempt to grab a bigger share
of the consumer market.
</P>
<P>
   Now the 24-7 trend is spreading into the high-powered financial
sector. Investment houses, banks, and other institutions are
finding they have to operate around the clock to compete on line
and in the global marketplace. Even the New York Stock Exchange is
considering evening and weekend hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``In today's environment, there are now people who work until 6
p.m., put the kids to bed, and then go back to work,'' said Jim
Peters, president of US retail operations for Staples. ``We want
those people to shop with us when it is most convenient for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Some workers, pointing to a need for flexibility, prefer
nontraditional hours and shifts. For others, however, 24-7 means
schedules that change from week to week, or late-night hours that
reduce family and personal time and cut into much-needed sleep. For
some, particularly low-wage women and minorities, the ability to
choose or redefine one's work schedules remains a luxury.
</P>
<P>
   Sociologist Harriet Presser, a professor at the University of
Maryland, says the shift from 9-to-5 to 24-7 is increasing within
the service sector, and will likely expand among poor women
employed as cashiers, nurses aides, food servers, telemarketers,
and cab drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Presser worries that such changes will strain marriages to the
breaking point and disrupt relations between parents and children.
In a June 1999 article in the journal Science, she wrote that men
employed at night and married less than five years are six times
more likely to divorce or separate within the next five years than
are men in traditional, 9-to-5 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When women work nights and have been married more than five
years, the odds of divorce or separation are three times as high
(as for the male night workers),'' said Presser.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's the workers' choice, fine,'' said Sarah Nathan, a
spokeswoman for the Massachusetts AFL-CIO. ``But some workers
barely have enough time to spend with their families. Others choose
the schedule because they realize that if they can work nights,
they won't have day care costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Capen, 38, fits the latter category. She oversees legal
secretaries and word processing staff as they prepare documents for
the Boston law firm Hale and Dorr. Her work week: Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday, 4:30 p.m. to 2 a.m., and Thursday from 4:30
p.m. to 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to work Monday through Friday, 9 to 5,'' said Capen.
``But when I began to have children, I changed my schedule to
weekends and then went to nights. My kids have never been in day
care. I've helped out at school, in the classroom, and I've been to
their school plays. I'm there when my kids get on the bus, and I'm
there when they get off.''
</P>
<P>
   Thornton, the computer operator at Thompson Financial, says his
hours made it possible for him and his wife to avoid up to $1,000
per month in day care costs.
</P>
<P>
   Computer operator Michael Thomas, 31, took the 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.,
three-day-a-week job at Thompson for a different reason: He wanted
to switch from customer service work to the IT field.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Koen, founder of Round-the-Clock Systems: The 24-7
Solutions Co. in Portland, Maine, says some employers are expanding
work hours internally while others are getting 24-hour coverage by
linking time zones around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the regular day shift ends, employees may transfer
records to an employee in Ireland who then transfers work to
someone in India and then back to New York.''
</P>
<P>
   One example: BankBoston's Fand and Podolsky.
</P>
<P>
   The bank's global foreign exchange department was still in its
infancy when Fand, a 1988 graduate of Swarthmore College, joined
the financial institution three years ago. Now, he manages a
seven-member strategy team that works out of offices in Boston,
Singapore, and London. Together, the team tracks events that affect
the world's currencies 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Fand is briefed by a team member in London just before dawn.
Podolosky, by contrast, begins and ends his day with calls to and
from Singapore. Their findings, culled from a nonstop flow of news,
stock quotes, and currency pricings, are presented to the bank's
trading floor at 7 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Currency markets are always open. They never close,'' noted
Fand, whose team members carry beepers, cell phones, and
``clickers,'' palm-size devices that provide real-time, 24-hour
pricing of currency, stocks, and bonds along with the world's top
headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Podolsky, a former Dow Jones writer, wears the clicker all the
time, including weekends. He reasons that if XYZ Co. is considering
a billion-dollar acquisition in another country and needs to
convert dollars to euros, a 1 percent change in the cost of the
currency could increase _ or decrease _ the transaction by $10
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``When that happens, customers want to know, any time or
wherever they are, whether they should ignore it or pay
attention,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, such devotion to work has some experts worried. They say
Americans' preoccupation with TV, the Internet, and their jobs is
taking too much time away from sleep. The National Sleep Foundation
reports 20 percent of the 25 million workers who have
nontraditional hours _ other than 9 to 5 _ routinely fall asleep at
work. And of those who struggle to keep their eyes open during the
day, 34 percent are dangerously drowsy, resulting in the yearly
loss of $18 billion in production.
</P>
<P>
   Fand, whose wife likes that he is home by 4 p.m., acknowledges
that he doesn't always get enough sleep but says his hours aren't
to blame. An Orthodox Jew, he observes the Sabbath on Saturdays and
sleeps 12 to 15 hours to make up for the late hours he keeps.
``Other than that,'' he said, ``I lead a night owl's life.''
</P>
<P>
   Podolsky, by contrast, is usually in bed by 10 p.m. He says his
schedule allows him to spend a significant amount of time with his
son before bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a while your body gets used to living on limited
sleep,'' said Capen, who works the 4:30 p.m. to 2 a.m. shift.
``When my kids are in school, I babysit for my sisters' kids. I get
out at 2 a.m., home by 3 a.m. and I am back up by 7 a.m. I get
about four hours of sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Capen says she gets more sleep on Tuesdays, when she is off.
That night, she's in bed by 9 or 10 p.m., trying ``to play
catch-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Some companies have gone the extra step to hire consultants to
help workers cope with their new shifts.
</P>
<P>
   Take Sipex, a Billerica, Mass. manufacturer and designer of
analog semiconductor circuits. Last year, it hired Round-the-Clock
Systems to teach its shift workers strategies to keep them alert
and productive during the third shift.
</P>
<P>
   Sipex night-shift manager Kathy Bourne, 39, says the course

   ``Organizations usually need to make two major changes,'' said

THE OTHER WORLD WAR I BOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last year's 80th anniversary of the end of World War I inspired
a publishing boomlet in Britain, with entries ranging from ``The
Virago Book of Women and the Great War'' to a battlefield
travelogue bearing the unavoidable title, ``Trench Fever.''
</P>
<P>
   The book that got the most attention was Niall Ferguson's ``The
Pity of War: Explaining World War I.'' Published in the United
States in April, it offers a relentlessly revisionist
interpretation of the war's origins, conduct, and consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson (first name pronounced NEEL) is a fellow and tutor in
modern history at Oxford University. Among many other controversial
arguments, he contends Britain would have fared better as a
noncombatant and that German victory might well have resulted in a
prototype of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times has described Ferguson, 35, as ``the most
talked-about British historian of his generation.'' John Keegan, a
friend, calls him ``terribly delightful and charming.'' Ferguson, a
Glasgow native, writes often for the popular press (his wife, Susan
Douglas, is a well-known London journalist) and makes frequent
radio and television appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most historians would benefit from the discipline of having to
address a mass audience,'' he says during a telephone interview
from his office at the Bank of England, where he's researching a
history of bond trading. ``The best history is the history which
has been discussed publicly, and not just in narrow academic
seminars.''
</P>
<P>
   Finance has been an important theme in Ferguson's work. His
first book, ``Paper and Iron,'' examined the interrelationship
between inflation and politics in Weimar Germany. ``The World's
Banker: The History of the House of Rothschild'' is a massive
account of the famed European banking firm.
</P>
<P>
   World War I has a personal meaning for Ferguson, whose
grandfather fought in the trenches. ``It is, from a British point
of view, the worst war _ perhaps you might even say the worst
historical experience _ of all.. . . I'm born 50 years after it
started, but the first thing I do seriously at school as a project
is about the trenches in the Western Front because there's that
combination of oral tradition and the literature, which makes it
still seem like `the big event.' ''

CHILDREN VS. MEDIA; OLD NOTES FROM DOWN BEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a media-saturated age, major news events invariably unfold in
three acts: first the event itself, then the commentary on the
event, then the commentary on the commentary.
</P>
<P>
   After we've been pummeled with opinions by the punditocracy, it
can be cathartic when they're indicted for a rush to judgment. A
vivid example, of course, was Monicagate, which produced a few
squirmy moments for Sam Donaldson and other talk-show oracles when
Bill Clinton's presidency survived after all.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the Columbine High School massacre, much
op-ed and airwave commentary has focused on whether violent images
produced by pop culture contribute to real-world violence. And here
comes a wave of post-commentary commentary in this month's
Harper's, where MIT's Henry Jenkins and NYU's Thomas de Zengotita
argue that pundits, along with parents and lawmakers, are looking
through the wrong end of the telescope.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins's piece, composed as an e-mail to MIT students,
describes his testimony before a Senate committee whose members
were intent only on ratifying their assumptions about the cultural
impact of video games, movies, and the Internet. But commentators
and politicians have missed the ``key issue,'' Jenkins argues,
which ``isn't what the media are doing to our children, but rather
what our children are doing with the media.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, simple cause-and-effect equations fail to
reflect our complicated relationship to pop culture. Placing the
blame for Columbine on video games is misguided, according to
Jenkins; we need to answer why some alienated or picked-on youths
are drawn to ``brutal images'' rather than focus on the images
themselves, because when it comes to influences on young people's
behavior, ``real life trumps media images every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Zengotita approaches from another angle. He believes media
images are more powerful than ever because they are more pervasive
than ever, with better ``production values'' ratcheting up their
intensity, and asserts that virtual violence has effects even among
kids who don't act out a la Columbine: ``They go ironic rather than
psychotic.''
</P>
<P>
   But Zengotita says most mainstream pundits who talk about the
effects of media images on behavior miss the larger point that the
line between simulation and reality is quickly vanishing _ ``They
can't believe that virtual reality is real'' _ and that their glib
answers in the wake of tragedy conceal the cold reality that ``we
are at an utter loss.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's some fascinating stuff in the July issue of Down Beat,
which is celebrating its 65th anniversary by reprinting old stories
about the hallowed likes of Louis Armstrong, Billie Holiday, Duke
Ellington, Dizzy Gillespie, and Thelonious Monk.
</P>
<P>
   Because these are contemporaneous interviews and essays, we get
a glimpse of the giants of jazz when they were working musicians,
before they disappeared beneath layers of legend. For instance, Nat
Hentoff's 1955 interview with Ella Fitzgerald reveals a singer in
the throes of despair, longing to host her own TV show but knowing
it was unlikely because of ``the way things are,'' her career
stalled because her record company was giving potential hit songs
to other singers. ``I'm so heartbroken over it . . . . There must
be something I can make that people who buy records would like to
hear,'' she said. (There was: The next year, she would record
``Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Cole Porter Songbook'').
</P>
<P>
   Events now embedded in jazz history regain the flavor they had
at the time. Anguish pervades the 1955 appreciation by Leonard
Feather that begins: ``The agony of living is over for Charlie
(Yardbird) Parker.'' The tensions between big-band musicians and
bebop pioneers are manifest in a 1949 item about Buddy Rich firing
what he called the bop ``element'' in his band. When Holiday split
from Count Basie in 1938, Down Beat weighed in with gusto, blaming
producer John Hammond for ``engineer(ing) the whole mephitic
business,'' lamenting the blow to Basie, ``a hell of a swell egg,
deserving better breaks,'' and concluding that while Holiday had
landed a new gig singing with Artie Shaw, ``it is a damn shame she
has to waste her talents with a band of that caliber.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like scorpions in a bottle, the players of Monicagate can't stop
trying to give each other one last, mortal sting. This month, the
battle for the final word is being waged by proxy, as Linda Tripp's
two children, Allison and Ryan, take to the pages of George
magazine for a stirring defense of Mom and, not so incidentally, a
few nasty digs at Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The portrait they paint is not so dissimilar from the portrait
Lewinsky (inadvertently) painted during her interview with Barbara
Walters: that of a supremely self-absorbed airhead. Ryan Tripp
claims that Lewinsky routinely called his mother 30 or 40 times a
night, and even tracked the family down during a Lake Placid
getaway so she could whine about her troubles. Amusingly enough,
Tripp says he called it the ``All Monica, All the Time Show'' _ the
very label critics would later give TV's obsession with the story.
</P>
<P>
   But laudable though their familial loyalty is, the Tripp-lets
are not persuasive in arguing that their mother was a selfless
angel of mercy who was ``ministering'' to Lewinsky. And if they
wanted to be free of the suspicion of agenda-laden malice that
clings to their mother, they really should have refrained from the
wisecracks about Monica's sexual technique.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even discounting for hype, the Internet Gold Rush is a
fascinating spectacle to watch, a marriage of high-tech idealism
and get-rich-quick schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Wired, the Web-head bible, excerpts Po Bronson's new book on the
modern pioneers stampeding to Silicon Valley, ``The Nudist on the
Late Shift,'' in which he tracks the rise and failure to rise of
several would-be entrepreneurs in their mid-20s. All of them share
a cockeyed optimism that their product will be one the Net can't
live without, and all possess what Bronson calls the essential
valley trait, a ``willingness to throw oneself into situations most
people would feel are out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Bronson's use of the first-person seems driven more by authorial
ego than narrative necessity, but that annoyance aside, he creates
absorbing portraits. There's a guy who funded his startup by
growing marijuana in western Massachusetts, a fellow who subsists
on pancakes because he agreed to forgo his salary in a bid to
attract investors, and a guy who won't get paid unless he finds
$500,000 in investment capital for his firm. All seem to work 70
hours a week, all seem to love risk, and all could end up
millionaires _ or big-time busts.

NONCOMBATANT JOHN KEEGAN CONVEYS THE FEEL OF BATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ World War I puzzles John Keegan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no huge issues at stake,'' he says of the subject
of his latest book, ``The First World War,'' during a recent lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very difficult to explain why the war was fought, why it
went on so long, why people were so passionate to submit to it.
It's a war where people are writing the war aims several years
after the war has begun, as the Germans did, at the insistence of
the Austrians, in 1917.''
</P>
<P>
   Such puzzlement on Keegan's part is, in a way, a tribute to the
conflict. For there are few things he does not know about military
history. Keegan, the author of 20 books on the subject, spent
nearly three decades teaching at the Royal Military Academy,
Sandhurst (the British equivalent of West Point), and for the past
13 years has been defense correspondent of The Daily Telegraph
newspaper of London.
</P>
<P>
   Keegan's fellow military historian Stephen Ambrose, speaking
from his Montana home, ranks him at ``the top'' of their
profession. Former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger professes
``enormous admiration for his work.'' Keegan, Weinberger says from
his Washington office, ``combines literary craftsmanship of a high
order with a wide-ranging technical and historical knowledge that
enables him to convey with remarkable realism the sights and sense
and sounds and feel of battle.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes such mastery of his subject so striking is that, as
Keegan wrote in the first sentence of what remains his most famous
book, ``The Face of Battle'' (1976), ``I have not been in a battle;
not near one, nor heard one from afar, nor seen the aftermath.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1934, Keegan grew up in the shadow of war. His father
and two uncles fought in World War I; and World War II ``had a very
formative influence on me,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But military service was ruled out. At 13, Keegan was diagnosed
with tuberculosis of the hip and spent much of the next four years
in a hospital bed. While an Oxford undergraduate, he underwent a
hip fusion after the disease recurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm lame,'' Keegan says quite matter of factly. ``That was a
terrific advantage because I could ask about things, and people
would tell me when they might have said `Look, go and find out for
yourself.' They didn't say that because they realized I wasn't in a
position to.''
</P>
<P>
   For many years, Keegan had a slight limp. His condition worsened
considerably three years ago. ``My back gave out,'' he shrugs. He
now requires a cane and walks almost doubled over.
</P>
<P>
   Keegan scoffs at the suggestion that studying warfare was a
compensation for being unable to pursue soldierly derring-do. ``I
think those are little-boy feelings. I might have been prone to
them as a little boy, but I think the reality of being on a
battlefield nowadays is that you spend a lot of time cowering in
shelter and not striking a heroic figure at all.''
</P>
<P>
   A broad grin covers Keegan's face as he says this. A man who
likes to laugh early and often, he is decidedly convivial and
enjoys good talk. His conversation ranges far and wide, as befits
his specialty. ``Wars on land embrace every aspect of the life of
nations and peoples and societies,'' he says. ``In a way,
everything is relevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of two hours, the discussion ranges far from
World War I and matters martial. He happily discourses on the
Pentagon as a work of architecture, the psychology of Alger Hiss,
the relative merits of Richard Nixon, the culinary attractions
(such as they are) of Abilene, Kan., the nature of Bill Clinton's
charm, and how Americans' mania for rules are the dark underbelly
of their love of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   The last topic hits close to home. Having asked a waitress with
mock urgency, ``Can't we get something a little stronger?,'' when
she inquires whether he would like water to drink, Keegan learns he
must extinguish his cigarillo when she returns bearing his gin and
tonic. ``What's a drink without a puff,'' he sighs.
</P>
<P>
   She lets Keegan finish his smoke, perhaps charmed by his
port-and-Stilton tones. Indeed, it's an accent worthy of Gielgud or
Guinness, with a vocabulary to match. Words such as ``chap,''
``righto,'' and ``shirty'' pepper Keegan's sentences, and a
languorous ``terribly'' is his adverb of choice.
</P>
<P>
   Keegan's next book will be on the influence of
intelligence-gathering on military operations. ``It'll be largely
about the 20th century,'' he notes, ``because secrets only became
totally accessible when you got radio, when you could start
listening in and crack codes.''
</P>
<P>
   Originally, Keegan hoped to become a naval historian. One
venture into the field excepted, ``The Price of Admiralty'' (1989),
it's a path he chose not to follow. ``Naval history is a completely
different subject from the history of warfare on land,'' he
explains. ``It's so dominated by technology.. . . I've discovered
that if you make the slightest technical mistake 500 Patrick
O'Brian fans fall on you from a great height, screaming, `Fool!
Idiot! Stupid! Don't you know the difference between a shroud and a
backstay?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Keegan entered military history much in the way one enters
retail sales or any other less exalted field: through the help
wanted section.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose when I came down from Oxford I didn't really know
what I was going to do.. . . As soon as I discovered you could get
a job as a military historian, I decided, well, that's what I'll
try to do and I eventually did. I saw an advertisement in The Times
(of London) and I wrote and they said (at Sandhurst), well, it's
actually not for military history _ I think it was for modern
languages or something _ but there would be an opening the
following year. . . I waited, had an interview, and was offered a
job.'' The rest is all _ military _ history.
</P>
<P>
   It would be nearly two decades, though, before Keegan published
``The Face of Battle.'' That book's enormous critical and popular
success _ ``it was a main choice of the Book-of-the-Month Club,''
Keegan cheerfully recalls, ``so I received a vast check _ made him
realize that he could make a career of writing as well as teaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hadn't imagined that I had the gift to be a writer at
all. I'd always thought that writing was a very arcane business.. .
. There was some special secret to it. Of course, I now know there
isn't, at all, actually. If you have a certain facility, if you can
put words together in a certain order, it's just a question of
sticking at it.''

IN HOMES, DETRITUS OF WAR IS LEFT BEHIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEC, Yugoslavia _ Every house in Kosovo holds a story of the
war, and many of the tales are not yet told.
</P>
<P>
   In Jeton Bala's home, Serb soldiers left behind tools of
violence and destruction, sinister calling cards of the uninvited
houseguests.
</P>
<P>
   The 50 or so Serb militia who took over Bala's home during the
war did not bother to clean up when they departed, and the filth
they left is a chilling reminder of what was done inside the house
while Bala was waiting out the war as a refugee in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Inside a cabinet is a grenade, tucked into a belted leather
holster. Dozens of bottles of gasoline, oil, and other substances
to set houses afire litter the front garden.
</P>
<P>
   A military vest was left behind, as were dirty, military-green
socks. A metal box for bullets was dumped in the den floor, along
with some ammunition and a rope baton, presumably for beatings.
Drugs and a hypodermic needle lie strewn on a bookcase, and Bala's
coffee cups, used and not washed by the Serbs, are on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The windows are covered with blankets. The cellar was turned
into a bomb shelter and apparently a place for mixing Molotov
cocktails, judging by the glass bottles and rags found lying
around. A suspicious cable, which Bala fears is attached to a mine
or booby-trap, snakes through the overgrown backyard grass.
</P>
<P>
   It's not easy, sleeping in the same house the enemy used as a
base to destroy his ethnic Albanian neighbors' homes and, perhaps,
kill some of them.
</P>
<P>
   But Bala has nowhere else to sleep, and feels lucky that there
is enough of his house left standing that he can restore it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess my house was not burned because they were living
here,'' muses the 22-year-old Bala. He points to his mattresses and
sofa-beds the Serbs left undone, places where Bala now spends his
nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where else to sleep? All I can do is clean it all out,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tahira, 72, is also sleeping in a bed used by Serbs. But it is
not her own home, which was burned to the ground by Serb
paramilitary, her neighbors told her, just hours after the peace
deal between NATO and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was
signed last month.
</P>
<P>
   So Tahira, who did not want her real name used, moved into an
apartment abandoned by Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   It's much smaller than the grand house Tahira lived in with her
extended family. Like many Kosovar Albanian families, Tahira's clan
had put much of their money and effort into their home, which
housed several generations and an endless stream of houseguests.
</P>
<P>
   Her apartment now is grim and utilitarian, the walls bare of
photos, the furniture cheap. The windows have been criss-crossed
with masking tape, a feeble effort by the departed Serbs to keep
the glass from shattering in case of NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably with more time to pack, the departing Serbs left an
apartment that was clean, yet cleaned-out of anything valuable,
save a TV and VCR.
</P>
<P>
   Tahira does not like laying her head on a Serb's bed, in a
Serb's apartment, in what had been a largely Serb housing block.
She does not like the feeling of eating from Serb plates, in a Serb
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   But ``what else can we do?'' Tahira asked, weeping softly as she
caressed her grandson's hair. ``If we don't use this apartment, we
will have to sleep on the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most Serb houses and shops were undisturbed during the war, but
the return of Albanian refugees, some of them angry and vengeful,
meant the Serb properties were not safe for long.
</P>
<P>
   Some Albanian families, like Tahira's, moved into the houses of
Serbs, who themselves fled in fear of retribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``KLA Commander Here _ Don't Touch!'' says a note inked into the
wooden door of one formerly Serb apartment here. Other apartments
have handwritten Albanian names pasted on the door, covering the
names of the one-time Serb occupants.
</P>
<P>
   Other Serb residences have been set afire, either by Albanians
or by Serbs who would rather raze their houses than provide shelter
for Albanians, NATO officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have many, many reports of houses burning, but always it is
too late'' to stop the damage by the time Kosovo Force
peace-keepers get there, said K-FOR spokesman Major Vincente
Dalmau. In the area around Pec, the western Kosovar region where
the worst reported Serb atrocities occurred, there are as many as
20 reports of house-burnings a day, Dalmau said, and sometimes
entire villages have been burned.
</P>
<P>
   With so many Serbs gone from Pec, the Albanians here now fear
their fellow Albanians. One Pec man returned June 17 to find that
his home, also used as a base for Serb forces, had been looted of
nearly everything, except for some valuable Oriental chairs and a
dressing screen. By the time the man's father returned to begin
repairing the house, it had been looted again, this time, by
Albanians, who said they would kill the man if he tried to retrieve
his things.
</P>
<P>
   Linda, a young Albanian woman, returned to her Pristina
apartment to find that an Albanian family had bunked there, though
she said the family was prepared to leave now that she was back.
</P>
<P>
   Bala said he sleeps in his unfinished home because he is afraid
Albanian neighbors will steal his furniture. Tahira's greatest fear
is that the KLA will burn the Serb apartment she now occupies,
unaware that an Albanian family now lives there.
</P>
<P>
   For those who managed to stay in their own homes during the war,
the memories can be nightmarish. Sandwiched between two Serb
militia bases, one of which was Bala's place, Safet Idrizi said she
saw it all: the firebombs being made in Bala's house, then thrown
into Albanian homes. The house across the street was used as a
prison by the Serbs, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The house on the other side of Bala's place was a telephone
center, and Serbs lured girls inside by telling them they could
call their families, she said. Behind the heavy door, the girls
were raped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard them screaming. I heard their voices inside,'' said
the 36-year-old Idrizi, her seven children clutching at her dress.
</P>
<P>
   Idrizi still can not believe she is alive. Bala sorts through
instruments of death. And Tahira hopes she will be alive long
enough to again live in her own home, and not the cast-off of
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they come back, we will leave,'' she said. ``But we have no
place to go.''

   SOUTHWICK, Mass. _ Three years ago, on a springlike day in
mid-March, Diana Flynn and her family and friends in Vista, Calif.,
celebrated her 30th birthday. Then she hooked a trailer onto her
old pickup, packed her worldly possessions, put her dog and cat
into the cab with her, and raced across the country in 3 1/2 days.
Her destination was this little town south of Springfield on the
Connecticut line.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn was about to become an organic truck farmer _ to grow
vegetables and take them to market. ``I was on a mission,'' she
says. ``I wanted to start that season.''
</P>
<P>
   What she found was cold and wind. It was much too early to
plant. ``This isn't California,'' she told herself one chilly day.
</P>
<P>
   She had moved 3,000 miles bent on becoming the next generation
at Flynn's Farm _ land her Connecticut-born dad had bought 17 years
ago. ``Since I was 15,'' she says, ``we talked about this place
being a generational thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The first thing she did was pick a new name. Flynn's Farm became
the Thankful Earth Organic Farm. Her sign replaced her father's.
</P>
<P>
   Like the women 300 years ago who worked this land against all
odds, Diana Flynn is something of a pioneer. She operates on a
shoestring, largely alone, practicing organic techniques she
learned in California, and trying to turn the farm into a viable
business. She races to keep a row ahead of weeds that threaten to
dwarf her produce; she has no irrigation in one of the dryest,
hottest summers on record; and there are days when she misses her
family so much, she has to call home for a pep talk.
</P>
<P>
   None of this shows.
</P>
<P>
   Athletic and strong, Flynn is mellow in the way only someone
raised in southern California can be, and she seems genuinely happy
on the land. Kristopher Fournier, the 10-year-old grandson of a
friend, is spending time with her this summer, and he uses the farm
as a giant playground, rushing to show her his latest discovery.
Two of Flynn's potbellied pigs are nibbling her plants, and she
laughs at how silly they look. ``Aren't they hilarious?'' she asks.
``They only eat weeds.'' Journey, her dog, is being chased by Lexi,
her boyfriend's dog, and both come to a grinding halt in the row of
lettuce she has just finished weeding. ``Hey, guys,'' she says,
without raising her voice, ``not here.'' One of the three roosters
is crowing. (Two live in a tree outside her bedroom window and
begin their routines very early.) The duck is chasing the goose.
``They're mated for life,'' she explains.
</P>
<P>
   Thankful Earth Farm is a child's paradise, and one day Flynn
hopes to host children there. ``I love children,'' she says. In the
off-season, she works for the local school system as an aide to a
4-year-old nonverbal autistic boy she describes as ``a character, a
happy, very loving kid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to be involved with special-education kids,'' she
says. Flynn is studying at neighboring Westfield State College to
get certified in teaching. One day, she says, she'd like to plant
``a kid's garden with no rules, where they can do whatever they
like.''
</P>
<P>
   There's an old A-frame in the back woods of the farm, and she
imagines a program in which teenage girls could stay overnight. At
one point, she thought about starting a camp. ``But farming
overtook that a little.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, she weeds _ and, in the heat, she weeds like crazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The term `farmer' gets reduced to `weeder,' '' says Flynn's
boyfriend, Dudley ``Lee'' Warren, 43. Warren spends weekends in
Southwick working the farm, fixing machinery, and mowing the 40
acres where organic hay grows. During the week, he works at a
printing company on the Connecticut coast. He hopes to find another
job closer to Southwick so he and Flynn can live together. ``A big
part of what I do involves Lee,'' says Flynn.
</P>
<P>
   The hay feeds two untrained horses, a brother and sister named
Rocky and Brandy. No one can ride them now, but sometime this
summer Flynn will do a trade with her student's mother: While Flynn
works with her son, the mother will train the horses so they can be
led with halters. Then, when the weather turns cold, Flynn will be
able to walk the horses from the field to the barn. ``I can walk
one now, but the other scares the dickens out of me,'' she says.
``And I've had horses all my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocky and Brandy grazed on the three acres that Flynn now
cultivates for produce, and she's sure that contributes to the good
soil. A pond and a well are on the land, so if she ever decides to
irrigate, she has water. She's not worried about the dry spell.
``We don't irrigate. If you start, you have to continue. If you dig
down,'' she says, ``the soil can be moist a couple inches down. It
depends on what your soil is like.'' Hers, she says, ``has a rich
humus and lots of good compost.''
</P>
<P>
   Thankful Earth Farm's 61 acres are located in the ``Southwick
Jog,'' where the horizontal border between Massachusetts and
Connecticut dips slightly, the result of a 17th-century surveying
error. A pocket of the Bay State is surrounded on three sides by
Connecticut. ``This farm is in the extreme southwest corner of that
land,'' says Warren, who is the president of the Connecticut
chapter of the Northeast Organic Farming Association.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn's father, Patrick, who was raised in nearby Bloomfield,
Conn., bought the farm with the intention of working it after his
retirement. For many years, he spent seven months here selling hay,
usually breaking even. He expects to help out in early October when
his daughter plans a pumpkin celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Flynn pays the mortgage on the land when Diana can't.
``When she needs help, she asks for it,'' he says, ``but she wants
to do it on her own.'' She comes up with money for her living
expenses, truck fuel and maintenance, seeds, farm insurance, and
machinery repairs. ``Lee has also put a lot of time and money into
this farm,'' says Diana Flynn.
</P>
<P>
   Her father put the farm into an Agricultural Preservation
Restriction program, which means that the state owns the
development rights so no one can build on it. If the land were
sold, Patrick Flynn would have to buy back the development rights
from the state. ``But I'm not going to do that,'' he says. ``The
farm is going to be hers anyway _ hers and her brother's.''
</P>
<P>
   The preservation program, says Diana Flynn, ``is a good
incentive for young families. It's land. How many single women can
afford to buy land?''
</P>
<P>
   She's not entirely alone out here. Flynn aunts and cousins live
nearby, though she doesn't see them very much. When, as a teenager,
Flynn would come east with her brother and father, her mother would
say, ``You guys are going to fool's paradise.''

WILL BUSH DEREGULATE POLITICS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ On the same historic day that a 1970s special
prosecutor law lapsed, allowing the decriminalization of politics,
one presidential candidate also achieved an ability to deregulate
politics. George W. Bush, with $36 million in his kitty, can change
the campaign finance system in a most effective way: by ignoring it
and letting it fall of its own absurd weight.
</P>
<P>
   When _ more likely than if _ Bush rejects federal matching
funds, he will present a free-market solution to a public-sector
nightmare. To become a leader, he can set an example by listing all
of his contributors instantly on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   If he is to deregulate politics, he should emulate a successful
federal agency. ``Government should do a few things, and do them
well,'' the Texas governor says in campaign speeches. While his
rivals roam the labyrinth of loopholes that define the Federal
Election Commission, a toothless bureaucracy that scares nobody,
Bush could initiate a reporting system with the thoroughness of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, an agency that can send people
to jail.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have been campaigning against the wrong decade. Many
GOP orators attack the libertine 1960s and propose posting the Ten
Commandments. From a philosophical point of view, the litigious
1970s offer a more inviting target.
</P>
<P>
   The Ethics in Government Act of 1978 expired on June 30, slowing
the swarm of gumshoes dispatched by special prosecutors. A frenzy
to improve other people's behavior, a hangover from the Watergate
scandal, animated campaign finance laws of the 1970s, premised on
the belief that all money is evil. Despite loophole after laughable
loophole, succeeding Congresses have pasted Pecksniffian idiocies
onto an already ramshackle structure.
</P>
<P>
   Other Texans have pioneered big-money innovations in politics.
John B. Connally in 1976, H. Ross Perot in 1992, and Senator Phil
Gramm in 1996 all shared a trait that Bush has so far stifled: a
grating ego that couldn't squeeze into the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   When reporters asked Bush how he raised all that dough, he
replied: ``A wonderful personality? That's what the pundits are
going to have to figure out.'' Pressed, he became more serious:
``People are going to have to develop a level of trust with anyone
who seeks public office. That is really what leadership is all
about. If people think that a candidate is going to be corrupted by
a $1,000 contribution, they should not vote for that person.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's haul is not ``soft money,'' the unaccountable cash that
has flooded presidential campaigns since 1988. This money has
arrived according to the original 1970s rulebook. From 75,000
donors, the average check to Bush is $480.
</P>
<P>
   In politics, the rich get richer. His Republican rivals must
sigh at the media's focus on the favorite. Between Cedar Rapids and
Des Moines, Bush was followed by 108 newsfolk in Iowa, more than
some candidates ever see. ``We've had 49 requests for one-on-one
interviews in this two and a half day trip,'' his communications
director, Karen Hughes, said here. ``All I can say is we'll be back
to California many times.''
</P>
<P>
   His rejection of federal funds will set a historical precedent
for early favorites and mark a clear philosophical divide between
Bush and those who plight their troth to federal matching funds. He
must do more if, as he says, he is ``to develop a level of trust''
with the people he wishes to lead.
</P>
<P>
   Although he does not need speechwriting help, as his 18-minute
chat before a ballroomful of eager listeners at the St. Francis
Hotel showed, Bush can claim the mantle of Ronald Reagan in two
ways. First, he can echo the Gipper's skepticism about the phrase,
``We're from the federal government and we're here to help you.''
Second, by providing his donor list with names, addresses, and
business interests to the press and everyone else in cyberspace,
Bush can say to voters: ``Trust, but verify.''

THE `ULTIMATE BALANCING ACT': CANDIDATE AND FIRST LADY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A typical day last week in the life of the most
active and activist first lady went like this:
</P>
<P>
   A millennium event on preserving historical documents at the
National Archives. A White House meeting on the effect of Medicare
cuts on teaching hospitals. A drop-by at Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin's farewell party. A family outing with daughter Chelsea and
husband Bill to the quarterfinals of the Women's World Cup. And
many, many phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Now, into what aides say is this superwoman schedule, Hillary
Rodham Clinton is about to wedge one more thing _ a campaign for an
open US Senate seat in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are used to juggling many roles every day, and I have no
doubt that Mrs. Clinton will be able to juggle one more
undertaking,'' said Melanne Verveer, the first lady's chief of
staff. ``In actual practice, we have to see how it evolves. It will
be the ultimate balancing act.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, ``Where's Hillary?'' is about to become a
favorite parlor game. Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton made history when she
filed papers with the Federal Election Commission and officially
launched a political exploratory committee aimed at capturing the
seat in 2000 of retiring Democratic Senator Daniel Patrick
Moynihan. Wednesday, as she sets off from the senator's farm in
Oneonta, N.Y., for a four-day ``listening tour'' of the state, a
new chapter opens on the country's most controversial and
scrutinized first lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``The listening tour will put her face-to-face with New Yorkers
in small settings,'' Howard Wolfson, Mrs. Clinton's campaign
spokesman said, adding that the first lady's get-acquainted trips
to her adopted state will span most of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   It has been clear for some weeks that Mrs. Clinton had made up
her mind to do what few of her close friends expected and what Carl
Sferrazza Anthony, a biographer of first ladies, called
``unprecedented'' and more. ``It is amazing, it is overwhelming,''
Anthony said. ``But if any woman could handle being first lady and
a Senate candidate, Hillary Clinton is the one.''
</P>
<P>
   It is generally agreed that Mrs. Clinton has set a new standard
for what it means to be first lady and political partner to the
president. But the implications and consequences of her likely run
for the Senate are just starting to sink in.
</P>
<P>
   For example, how will she coordinate her ceremonial White House
duties with what is expected to be a bruisingly partisan campaign
against New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani? Where will she live? How
will she handle an aggressive press corps that for years has been
held at bay by a very protective White House staff and the
unofficial status of her job? Who pays for her travel and how will
she utilize the perks of the White House? What role will the
president play? And how often will she be at odds with or try to
influence Clinton administration policy?
</P>
<P>
   ``From now on, everything she does as first lady is going to be
viewed through the prism of `does it help her or hurt her in New
York?' '' said Paul Costello, who was first lady Rosalynn Carter's
press secretary. ``There are apt to be situations where the White
House makes policy that runs counter to New York, and it will be
interesting to see how Mrs. Clinton balances it and weighs in.''
</P>
<P>
   That has happened already. Mrs. Clinton was invited by New York
political and labor union leaders to join them at a White House
meeting last week in arguing that the administration's plan to
overhaul Medicare would cut payments to New York's teaching
hospitals. Mrs. Clinton did not dominate the session, her press
secretary told reporters, but she did share the hospitals'
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   During a news conference the same day, President Clinton said he
will not be offended if Mrs. Clinton goes public with some of the
policy disagreements they have had in private. ``That's the way
democracy works,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to laugh: On one hand, Hillary Clinton is criticizing
some aspect of her husband's Medicare plan, and on the other we
hear that the president is going to be one of her most important
political advisers,'' said Sheila Tate, former press secretary to
first lady Nancy Reagan. ``I think it's schizophrenic, and it's a
good example of how strange and peculiar Mrs. Clinton is making
life for herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Tate says she cannot imagine that Mrs. Reagan ever contemplated
a run for public office.
</P>
<P>
   But historians say Mrs. Clinton, a lawyer by training and a
policy advocate by experience, has redefined the role of first lady
to the extent that this political race is not so extraordinary.
Mrs. Clinton has spearheaded an ambitious but unsuccessful
health-care reform plan, championed women's rights in dozens of
foreign countries, raised millions of dollars for Democratic
candidates, testified before an independent counsel's grand jury,
and advised the White House on strategy through a sex scandal and
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Clinton has done some good things, but I think now there
will be this nagging question that maybe everything she did in the
second term was inherently political,'' said Myra Gutin, author of
``The President's Partner'' and a professor at Rider University in
New Jersey. ``I think her Senate candidacy will really affect her
legacy and how she is perceived.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the public supports the first lady's pursuit of a
political career. A recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found 68
percent of Americans believe the first lady can perform her White
House duties while running for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton has told her staff she has no plans to give up her
policy issues, her causes, her travel, and her entertaining in and
restoration of the White House. ``She has said to all of us that
while this is a new process, she is not intending to give any of
her responsibilities as first lady short shrift,'' Verveer said.
</P>
<P>
   But the West Wing of the White House has come under fire from
the Republican Party and some public-interest groups for an alleged
misuse of federal resources to support Mrs. Clinton's frequent
political trips to New York. GOP chairman Jim Nicholson last week
asserted that Mrs. Clinton's flights on military aircraft had cost
the government more than $220,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary's flying military jets, but it's the taxpayers who are
being taken for a ride,'' Nicholson said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House insists the exploratory committee, which allows
Mrs. Clinton to raise money, will pay for future travel, a
headquarters and separate staff in New York, and any other expenses
her campaign incurs. But the first lady will not be able to
reimburse the Secret Service for the security and logistical
support it is required to provide her, and she may never convince
New Yorkers that the Manhattan traffic nightmares created by her
presidential-sized entourage are absolutely necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Clinton's stature as first lady will enhance her Senate
race, but it will also reinforce her status as an outsider in New
York,'' Costello said.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political scientist at Claremont
Graduate University, said that beyond the serious issues of White
House perks is the ethical question of whether the first lady is
trading on her position, and even on her misfortune in the wake of
the scandal involving Monica S. Lewinsky, to advance a political
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may be prudish about this, but it seems to me that this
particular first lady allowed herself to be part of a campaign
promise and package to the American people _`elect one, you get
two,' '' Jeffe said. ``Now, I wonder if her candidacy would be so
real if people didn't perceive her as the wronged woman, and that
this is her way, and the electorate's way, of getting back at the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Letitia Baldrige, who was first lady Jacqueline Kennedy's social
secretary, remembers Mrs. Kennedy carried out her duties ``through
thick and thin,'' and took an unconventional route _ taking up with
Greek tycoon Aristotle Onassis _ at a appropriate time after her
government role had ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has never been a first lady running for office, and
maybe there shouldn't be,'' said Baldrige, a doyenne of
Washington's dwindling white-glove manners and good taste.
``Hillary Clinton has a huge job right here in the White House, but
she will have to shirk her duties _ she certainly won't be the
hostess with the mostest _ if she is off in New York somewhere,
giving a campaign speech.''

ALL EYES, SOME NAYS ON BROWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Elinor Gatto, a lifelong San Franciscan,
considers Mayor Willie L. Brown Jr. a sure-fire winner, and she
could hardly contain her excitement at having won him for part of
the day.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmother of eight and the first-term mayor were slated to
have lunch on a recent afternoon _ her prize for the highest bid in
a parochial school auction. She called it her chance do good and
also to thank Brown for bringing style back to both the city and
City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``That he came out to the school really touched me,'' said
Brown, who was accompanied by her oldest grandchild. ``I just like
him. He's got style.''
</P>
<P>
   But as he gears up for next year's mayoral elections, Brown has
found that his colorful, press-the-flesh style may not as easily
satify other voters this time around. Although the election remains
his to lose, with supporters as well as many opponents predicting
victory, the adoration of the early days has waned even as San
Francisco continues to enjoy an unprecedented economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   Known for his impeccably tailored suits and brimmed hat, the
mayor was once hailed as a hero around San Francisco. As one of the
most powerful Democrats in the state, the former California
Assembly speaker still commands attention. President Clinton has
already given his endorsement. But recent polls find only about a
third of voters saying they expect to vote for him Nov. 2 _ half
the two-thirds support that swept him into office in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not bet against Willie at this point just because his
ratings aren't as high as they were,'' said Bruce Cain, a political
science professor at the University of California in Berkeley.
``Willie will survive by keeping out a competitor, or at least
keeping out competitors on the left. . .But I don't think he's
taking anything for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Brown faces no formidable competition on either end of
the political spectrum. Only Clint Reilly, a real estate magnate
who made millions working as a Democratic political consultant,
even merits a mention from most political observers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the filing deadline is almost a month away, and any
number of name candidates could still emerge. The entrance of
openly gay Board of Supervisors President Tom Ammiano, as expected
by some despite the Brown camp's claim that it has his word
otherwise, could siphon off votes and force an election runoff in
December.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is a candidate, or a potential candidate,
out there who can build the coalition Willie Brown has built,''
said Brown campaign spokesman P.J. Johnston. `` His politics and
personality fit with this city. . .But we have to remind our
supporters and instill in our volunteers that this is no
cakewalk.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in no other major city would a mayor overseeing such
prosperity need even entertain uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Since Brown took office in January 1996, unemployment has been
cut in half. Surging city revenues have transformed budget deficits
into surpluses. At $4.2 billion, his latest budget calls for more
than 1,000 new city jobs. Crime is down. Building is booming.
Property values are soaring. Public works projects include a
massive airport construction project.
</P>
<P>
   But San Francisco is no typical city. Socially liberal, more
conservative fiscally, with enough political factions to merit the
term Balkanized, residents tend to grumble about whoever is in the
mayor's office. They turned out each of Brown's last two
predecessors after one term.
</P>
<P>
   Now they are holding the current mayor accountable for not
solving the homeless problem or fixing the public transportation
system as he pledged to do in 100 days. Paul Boden, executive
director of the San Francisco Coalition on Homelessness, estimated
that as many as 14,000 homeless people sleep on the city's streets
on any given night. Despite some improvement, the buses and trains
still do not run on time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are disappointed in the mayor, especially in
regard to his ability to resolve some intractable problems,'' said
veteran pollster David Binder. ``They had their hopes raised that
Willie Brown being the consummate Sacramento politician with all
his power and trappings could be the one to bring real change.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many others, Binder said that Brown's personality reflects
the city's: flashy, flamboyant, quick with a quip. He also called
the mayor uniquely suited to keep the peace among San Francisco's
inevitably warring factions.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, disputed that Brown has brought the city
together, saying he has made criminals of the homeless and pitted
the working class against the wealthy as housing prices rocket. The
man who ran the Assembly for 15 years has now turned City Hall into
his own personal fiefdom, they complained.
</P>
<P>
   ``This administration carries a tremendous amount of clout, more
than anything I've ever seen,'' said Boden. ``At the same time, his
style of leadership is incredibly dysfunctional. Every city
department hates each other. There are power grabs and money
fights.
</P>
<P>
   Said Tom Pier, Clint reilly's campain spokesman, ``This has
become Willie Brown's machine town. There is no organized
opposition to his tenure. He controls all of the institutions, all
of the money, all of the people, be it business or political. .
.Who else is going to try to take him down?''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, David Lee, executive director of the Chinese
American Voter Education Commission in San Francisco, said he would
have called the race a ``sweeper'' for Brown, who won with support
that cut across racial, ethnic and class lines. Now, with the
mayor's poll numbers so low, Lee is waiting to see what other
candidates jump into the race. Still, Brown's support among the
city's large Asian American community remains strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Willie Brown has the power of incumbency, the greatest name
recognition,'' Lee said. ``Everyone knows him. They don't all like
him, but everyone knows him. Barring any major developments, he
should be able to sail in.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   At St. Peter's Lutheran Church on Cape Cod, the faithful still
drop dollar bills and checks into the collection basket.
</P>
<P>
   But a new program soon could push aside the collection plate as
the preferred way for some congregants to show their Christian
charity.
</P>
<P>
   Starting this month, members of the Harwich, Mass. congregation
can give glory to God electronically by having funds automatically
transferred from personal accounts to the church's account.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of savvier congregations are tapping into
high-tech ways to boost their coffers. At least 1,500 churches
across the country have started electronic funds transfer programs,
which many Americans use to pay everything from mortgages to cable
bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps us to be better givers and more consistent givers,''
said the Reverend Jane O'Hara Shields, pastor of St. Peter's. ``No
more leftovers.''
</P>
<P>
   There is some early evidence that high-tech giving programs tend
to loosen the wallets of churchgoers.
</P>
<P>
   One national program run by a Lutheran organization that has
enrolled more than 1,000 churches found that the average monthly
electronic offering is about $190.
</P>
<P>
   That compares with a monthly average of $33 that Protestant
Christians typically give their churches every week, according to
one recent study by Empty Tomb, an Illinois-based Christian
research group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The response has just blown us out of the water,'' said Royce
McEwen, an assistant vice president with Lutheran Brotherhood,
which is based in Minneapolis. ``We just can't get caught up on the
voice mails with congregations wanting information on how to get
enrolled in the program.''
</P>
<P>
   At one Roman Catholic Church in Minneapolis, for example, an
electronic funds transfer program started five years ago generated
enough income to allow the parish to create larger programs to help
the poor and homebound seniors, set up extra Sunday school classes,
and start a Sunday night Mass.
</P>
<P>
   About 500 of the 4,600 members at Basilica of St. Mary now
participate in the program. Many of them are young parishioners who
had not donated regularly in the past, said Thomas Green, the
church's director of finance and administration. Younger Catholics
who have grown up surrounded by computers seem to be comfortable
with the idea of electronic giving, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some church officials said this new style of collecting means
worshipers can concentrate on the word of God without worrying
about how much cash they have on hand to toss into the collection
plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got less clutter in their mind and heart to properly
prepare to celebrate the liturgy when they come to church on Sunday
mornings,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   But the increasing popularity of electronic funds transfer
programs has drawn criticism from some church officials who say the
practice takes away from the religious significance of giving.
</P>
<P>
   In many Sunday services, ministers typically lean on the Bible
and appeal to Christian responsibility to encourage members to
donate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a further distancing of the people from the personal
and mysterious aspects of worship,'' said William Albert Taylor,
stewardship director for the Church of God in Christ, a
predominantly African-American Pentecostal denomination based in
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Donating to churches electronically, some church officials said,
reduces something that should have religious significance to an
action as routine as paying the telephone bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many people, that tangible act of putting something in the
offering plate is the act of giving thanks for what God has given
them,'' said Terry Parsons, stewardship officer for the Episcopal
Church in America.
</P>
<P>
   At St. Peter's, which has 475 members, Shields acknowledged that
some more traditional-minded Christians might balk at embracing the
new technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a stigma and that will need to be overcome, like
anything else that's a change and a new way of thinking,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Though her church is starting an electronic giving program, the
old-fashioned collection basket will still be available for those
like Walter Walek, 68, who prefer to put their hands on the money
they donate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I just don't think that way,'' said Walek, St. Peter's
treasurer, adding that he doesn't pay any bills electronically. ``I
like to keep a little better handle on what's happening month to
month.''
</P>
<P>
   But St. Peter's congregant Wesley Schneider, 72, said electronic
giving ensures that churches are not shortchanged.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many times, people take care of all their necessary
expenses and then if there's something left over, they say, `Let's
give something to the church,' '' Schneider said.
</P>
<P>
   And though it might not be as visible as placing cash or checks
into the collection plate, Shields believes electronic giving can
be just as spiritual.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's why it's given and to whom we're giving it and how
generous we are with it,'' Shields said.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid making it seem that people who donate electronically
are giving nothing, the Lutheran Brotherhood electronic funds
transfer program provides envelopes with turquoise stickers bearing
the name of the program, ``Simply Giving,'' to put in the
collection plate.
</P>
<P>
   While local congregations in various denominations offer
automatic giving programs set up through individual banks or
electronic banking firms, so far only the Lutherans have
established a nationwide program.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was launched last September, 1,150 of the nearly 19,000
Lutheran churches in America have signed up for electronic giving,
including 14 in New England.
</P>
<P>
   A main goal, McEwen said, is to give churches a more predictable
income flow even when church attendance dips during the summer
vacation season, or in the winter when people leave northern
climates for warm-weather destinations.
</P>
<P>
   To donate electronically, church members simply fill out a form
designating how much they will give on a weekly, semimonthly, or
monthly basis.
</P>
<P>
   Churches that have started programs say participants tend to be
their most generous donors.
</P>
<P>
   Vanco Services, a Minnesota-based electronic banking company
that administers the program for Lutheran Brotherhood, has created
similar programs for dozens of Catholic, Episcopal, Evangelical,
Methodist, and other Christian congregations.
</P>
<P>
   In Vanco-administered programs, individual congregants are
charged $1 to enroll in electronic giving programs, while churches
must pay 25 cents for each transaction. Lutheran Brotherhood,
however, picks up the tab for the Lutheran congregations.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who are leery of electronic giving acknowledge that
tradition may not be able to stop technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all going to be doing this within five to 10 years
because of the generational shift, the way in which we transact
business,'' Parsons said.
</P>
<P>
   Shields said electronic giving seems to fall in line with
today's lifestyle. ``Writing checks is going out the window,'' she
said.

FOR TECH WEARY, HOME IS WHERE THE SILENCE IS 
</HEADLINE>

 By PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trying to create simplicity in a busy domestic life, a mother of
three refuses to buy an answering machine. A Boston College
professor has a self-imposed policy never to check his work e-mail
from home. And another man proudly says he'll never sign up for
call waiting on his home telephone line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spend all day at work being interrupted. Why do I want to be
interrupted at home?'' asked Matthew Neutra, 30, a computer map
maker from Sherborn, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   There's a quiet rebellion going on in households throughout the
country, led by harried people who refuse to let today's
communications equipment beep and flash its way into the sanctity
of their homes. After work days filled with the unpredictable
demands that come through multiple phone lines, computer screens,
pagers, cellular phones, and fax machines, many have chosen to
delete these devices from their home life.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by high-tech equipment at her office at the Boston
College Legal Assistance Bureau, Lynn Barenberg goes home to a
low-tech life. She broke down last year and bought an answering
machine but has resisted peer pressure to buy a computer, fax
machine, or cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does she have a videocassette recorder, a microwave, or a
compact disc player. Her simple life led one colleague to ask,
``Where do you live? Sturbridge Village?''
</P>
<P>
   ``My home is a refuge,'' said Barenberg, 45, a social worker.
``It's peaceful in terms of communications coming in and the
activity level. It's something that I value. Other people value
excitement and information.''
</P>
<P>
   When she told a friend she recently had bought an answering
machine, the friend deadpanned, ``Welcome to the 1980s.''
</P>
<P>
   Already overloaded with junk mail and telemarketing calls,
people say they don't need additional high-tech avenues for
unwanted messages. Junk e-mail is a new annoyance.
</P>
<P>
   While most people aren't entirely casting off telecommunications
devices or refusing to buy them, many put limits on them. Some turn
off the phone during three-hour evening ``family time'' periods,
while others refuse to give home e-mail addresses except to family
and close friends.
</P>
<P>
   Some also restrict those who know their cell phone numbers or
ignore the beeps of call-waiting _ considered a rude device by many
_ unless they suspect it might be an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   While working in the telecommunications sales business, Michael
Flynn, 28, of Nahant, sets limits by storing away his work beeper
and cell phone every weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Lowenstein, a wireless-phone specialist for the Yankee
Group, a Boston-based telecommunications research firm, said people
are understandably ambivalent about all the technology.
</P>
<P>
   While these devices can liberate people, they also contribute to
an instant-response culture that puts everyone on edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world just got faster and more intense,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lowenstein said that at his home he sets a three-hour period
around dinner when he is virtually off-limits to any outside
communication while relaxing with his family.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see why Americans feel overloaded and need to put
more barriers between work and home. According to a study last year
by Yankelovich Partners, a telecommunications marketing firm in
Claremont, Calif., workers receive an average of 11 messages from
voice mail or answering machines a day while at work, and 6.5
messages at home.
</P>
<P>
   And there's the temptation to check who has called. About 43
percent check their work messages when they're not working and 37
percent check home messages when they're at work. While on
vacation, 34 percent have checked their answering machine or voice
mail system at work.
</P>
<P>
   But all the checking of messages may not actually be creating
anxiety, said Howie Salend, a bond trader in Boston and father of
two. He said cell phones and e-mail can alleviate stress,
especially if you want to be reachable to a range of people, from
key clients to baby sitters. ``It really makes me feel more
relaxed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone negotiates these devices so well. Larry Rosen, a
University of California psychology professor who co-wrote the book
``Technostress,'' said many Americans are finding the need to adopt
new strategies for home life, as cell phones, home computers, and
pagers are becoming more affordable and ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel they're fighting a windstorm and they're trying to
stay sane,'' said Rosen, who also has a Web site
(www.technostress.com).
</P>
<P>
   Rosen said most people are divided into three categories:
``eager adopters'' who embrace new telecommunications devices;
``technology resisters'' who look the other way; and ``hesitant
prove-its'' who require proof of the advantages of the devices
before buying them.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of three teenage children sees no advantage in having
an answering machine. The only time she ever owned one was about
seven years ago, when she got it as a gift and it fell apart after
about a month. Its failure provided her with the perfect excuse to
throw it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't stand it,'' said the woman, who wished to remain
anonymous. ``I would come home and it would have the maximum number
of messages on the machine. I would feel the compulsion to call
back all the messages. It made my life more hectic and tense than
it already was.''
</P>
<P>
   A desire for more simplicity and civility is why Leslie Epstein,
the creative writing director at Boston University, forbids call
waiting on his home line, against his wife's pleas. He said the
device is extremely rude. ``It should be first-come,
first-served,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Tecce, an associate professor of psychology at BC, said
discipline is the key to making these technologies work for you. He
said people need to have the self-confidence to feel they aren't
going to be judged if they fail to respond promptly to a message.
</P>
<P>
   And they have to resist the temptation to be everywhere at once.
Tecce resolved never to let his home computer be used to check
office e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Neutra, the map maker, said he also strives for less beeping and
ringing while relaxing at home. For that reason, he's not buying a
cell phone even though all his friends have them.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main concern is being able to shut down and not be reached
for a while,'' he said.

SINGLE FATHERS EMBRACE ROLE, FIGHT STEREOTYPE 
</HEADLINE>

 By DORIS SUE WONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stephen Gandolfo was 41, unmarried, and doubtful he'd ever find
the right partner. Yet he yearned to be a parent.
</P>
<P>
   So he adopted a child.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't know it, but that made the special needs teacher a
member of the fastest-growing parenting group in the nation: single
fathers.
</P>
<P>
   US Census figures show the number of single fathers increased 25
percent _ to 2.1 million _ between 1995 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists, family law specialists, and advocates for fathers
see the trend as a natural extension of changing gender roles in
the home and workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men aren't being constrained by the worker role anymore,''
said Bob Maschi of the Fathers Group, a grass-roots advocacy group
in Framingham, Mass. ``A lot more fathers are taking on the
responsibility of parenting and society is letting them.''
</P>
<P>
   There's been no one path leading men to single fatherhood.
</P>
<P>
   Some gained custody of their children after being divorced (44
percent), separated (17 percent) or widowed (5 percent), according
to the Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   But many have never been married (35 percent).
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a growing population and, to some extent, an invisible
and unrecognized one,'' said William Pollack, author of ``Real
Boys'' and head of the Center for Men at McLean Hospital in
Belmont, Mass. ``Single dads don't get recognized for being
nurturers.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some single fathers said they grapple with many of the
same issues as single mothers _ juggling work and family, tight
finances, arranging child care, finding time for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But single fathers also said they wrestle with stereotypes of
either being wonderful saviors at one extreme or bumbling
incompetents at the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a funny reaction from people that men can't do it,''
said Bruce Acker, 66, of Tamworth, N.H., who over the years has
adopted seven racially mixed children, three of them since his wife
died a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Acker, a retired junior high school teacher, recalled that one
of his sons had to have a dashiki made for an African dance program
in which his fifth-grade class was participating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three mothers called and offered to make it,'' huffed Acker.
``I said, `I can do that.' We went uptown and bought the material,
and I used the stupid needle and thread and sewed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some single fathers, however, have felt trapped by their own _
and other people's _ images of them as heroes and superdads.
</P>
<P>
   After Richard Nocera's hyperactive 4-year-old son moved in with
him, ``everybody thought it was wonderful and everybody was so
enamored of what I was doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I was dying inside,'' said the 54-year-old hair stylist.
``I didn't dare say `I'm making a mess of it, I'm going out of my
mind.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Because men are socialized to be self-reliant, they often have a
hard time seeking parenting advice, psychologists and single
fathers said.
</P>
<P>
   And once they finally resolve to get help, they find precious
few programs designed for fathers.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey by the Children's Trust Fund found only 62
organizations in Massachusetts offering parenting support programs
for fathers, compared with an estimated 620 for mothers. And half
of the father programs were restricted to certain groups, such as
fathers on probation or teenage fathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dads are really starting to want to be more than just the
person who puts food on the table,'' said Jack Miller, associate
director at the Children's Trust Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, for whatever reasons, men, for the most part, never
really receive any kind of parenting education at any point in
their lives, which makes it more difficult to be effective and
nurturing parents when they do have children,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of studies have been conducted on children raised in
single-mother homes; children tend to be at greater risk for
poverty, low academic performance, teen pregnancy and criminal
activity.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers only are beginning to look at the 3.1 million
children who now are being raised by single fathers.
</P>
<P>
   Data compiled by the Census Bureau may hold some early clues:
Children who live in single-father homes are twice as likely to be
poor and to live in rental housing as children in two-parent homes.
Single fathers are less likely to get child support than single
mothers, but when they do get such payments, they tend to have
higher total incomes ($30,030) than single mothers ($21,829).
</P>
<P>
   Single fathers tend to think they pay a higher price in
corporate cultures if they make their children a priority.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Levey, a consultant at Work Family Directions in Brookline,
Mass., said, ``Men perceive if they were to ask for flexible hours
it would derail their careers.''
</P>
<P>
   But Levey said, ``The more men are asking for work-life
supports, it will just expedite the pace at which companies will
embrace these things.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing single men and women have in common: Both tend to be
vulnerable for substance abuse during their first year of single
parenting, said Charles Gregg, author of ``Single Fatherhood: The
Complete Guide.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel a lot of guilt, that they should always be attending
to their children and shouldn't take a night for themselves,''
Gregg said. ``The first six months you are trying to do everything
bigger than life and things start to fall apart. So you start with
the scotch.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Cain readily admits that the first several months after he
gained custody of his four sons, now ages 3, 6, 9, and 12, were
rough but said he was too afraid to ask for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was petrified,'' said the 36-year-old respiratory therapist.
``I almost didn't think I could do it. I was depressed because I
had all this responsibility and the kids were always fighting and I
wasn't sure I was doing the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Cain said he tried to parent by being a ``real disciplinarian,''
ordering the boys about and insisting the house be kept neat.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after 18 months of trying to cope on his own, Cain _ at
the urging of a state social worker _ reluctantly joined a Parents
Anonymous weekly support group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The group yelled at me,'' Cain said, ``and told me to sit back
and look at what is important and what isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Cain said, ``at times the house looks like it exploded, but
the kids aren't physically fighting anymore. They get along better
than they ever did.''
</P>
<P>
   Cain also has grown more confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may not be a perfect parent,'' he said. ``But I think I'm a
real good parent.''

FOR BOSTON MAFIA, ANOTHER STEP BACKWARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY RAKOWSKY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- For decades, Boston sported a branch office of La Cosa
Nostra, complete with a North End clubhouse, hangouts in East
Boston and Revere, and a sub shop in the Prudential Center.
</P>
<P>
   Like other Mafia thugs, they stole, extorted, and murdered, but
there was a home-grown characteristic to the crime organized by
familiar bad guys like Gennaro ``Jerry'' Angiulo and Charles
``Charlie Q'' Quintina.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, however, with generations of mobsters and wiseguy
wannabes behind bars, Boston hasn't been able to groom a new
godfather.
</P>
<P>
   The result, say law enforcement officials, is a new low in local
control of the Mafia _ last week's arrest of a Boston Mafia
hanger-on who's accused of sharing drug profits with a
(itals)Philadelphia(unitals) crime family.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something new,'' said Linda Vizi, FBI spokeswoman in
Philadelphia. ``We've seen the tentacles of the mob reach beyond
the immediate area in the past, but not into New England.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only is Angiulo's generation of leaders behind bars, but so
are many of his successsors, like reputed boss Francis P.
``Cadillac Frank'' Salemme, who hardly had a chance to rule before
he was indicted on racketeering charges four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Into the breach rushed such brash upstarts as Robert Luisi Jr.
of Medford, the only one left standing after the noontime massacre
in the 99 Restaurant in Charlestown four years ago that killed his
father and cousin.
</P>
<P>
   It was Luisi who was arrested June 28 along with Philadelphia
crime boss Joseph ``Skinny Joe'' Merlino, his alleged boss in
long-distance crime. A complaint filed in US District Court in
Boston accuses the two, and three other Boston area men, of
conspiring to sell cocaine to an undercover FBI agent.
</P>
<P>
   Crime experts say they doubt the incursion into Boston was
invited, making it akin to a hostile takeover attempt. And that
could doom Luisi and Merlino, whose father was an underboss before
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not only an embarrassment, that kind of violation of the
rules would really tick off a guy like Frank Salemme,'' said Dennis
O'Callaghan, the FBI's former organized crime chief supervisor.
``If I were Luisi and Merlino, I would be happy I was locked up.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Boston has been off-limits to outside crime
families. Law enforcement authorities have tracked Boston visits in
the past few years by John A. ``Junior'' Gotti, the reputed boss of
the Gambino crime family in New York, and by a West Coast-based
member of New York's Genovese crime family.
</P>
<P>
   Until the late 1980s, Boston had long been a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Patriarca crime family based in Providence, which
held regional dominion over racketeering. The one exception was the
area west of Worcester, which was formally shared with the Genovese
family.
</P>
<P>
   Merlino's foray into Boston, which led to FBI arrests in
Philadelphia and here, is testament to the weakness of the New
England family, law enforcement officials say, and the breakdown in
discipline throughout the Northeast, which was carved up into
underworld turf in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia traditionally has been an organized crime
stronghold, with more members than New England and a seat on ``The
Commission,'' sort of the Joint Chiefs of La Cosa Nostra. New
England has always had to derive its power through Genovese
representation on the board.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI in Philadelphia said it has evidence that Luisi, who is
not believed to be a made member of the Mafia in Boston, was not
only inducted into the Philadelphia family but promoted to
``capo,'' or captain.
</P>
<P>
   Luisi apparently finagled that role by claiming he controls
day-to-day Mob activities in Boston, according to tape excerpts in
court documents.
</P>
<P>
   If Luisi's claims to power are nothing more than
self-aggrandizement to make a drug deal, he could be in real
trouble, said O'Callaghan.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Mawn, FBI special agent in charge in Boston, said it is
surprising that anyone would utter a claim that he is in charge of
a Mob organization, given the bureau's strategy of picking off
anyone who flirts with leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're in a state of disarray, but because of the money
involved and the prestige, there are still a number of people
scrambling to position themselves in power,'' Mawn said.

 &HT;    June Carter Cash re-creates homespun sounds for '90s
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Toting an autoharp, praising Jesus and mangling the
pronunciation of ``Quentin Tarantino'' in one typically
idiosyncratic lyric, June Carter Cash isn't merely the queen of
old-timey traditional music _ she's a Holy Goof. It's her blessing
and her curse. As a member of country's founding family, the
Carters, and a collaborator with husband Johnny Cash, the vocalist
is at once sassy and reverent, high-spirited and humble. Her
cornball streak worked fine in the 1960s, when country radio
thrived on hits such as ``Jackson,'' but it was always her
gravel-throated mate who put the fear of God in everyone _ until
they forgot about him, too.
</P>
<P>
   Much as Johnny Cash reinvented himself in the '90s by going back
to his bare-bones origins (and accepting songs from a new
generation of rock songwriters), so June re-
</P>
<P>
   creates the traditional acoustic sounds she first made with the
Carter Family. Famous friends _ including Marty Stuart, former
son-in-law Rodney Crowell and string wizard Norman Blake _ drop by
for an informal session that unreels like a musical autobiography.
Carter Family staples (rough-hewn spirituals such as ``Diamonds in
the Rough,'' ``Meeting in the Air'') share the disc with true-life
Elvis reveries (``I Used to be Somebody''), rustic signatures
(``Ring of Fire'') and a comical ode to a granddaughter (``Tiffany
Anastasia Lowe''), warning her to stay away from a certain
filmmaker who ``makes his women wild and mean.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a hoot, pure and simple.

</P>
<P>
   ``Venni Vetti Vecci''
</P>
<P>
   Ja Rule. Def Jam. 20 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Considering how often Ja Rule says he's a skillful murderer,
it's surprising how often he misses on this debut. The gruff
rapper's unofficial bow on Jay-Z's ``Can I Get a ...'' was fine
enough. And this album's first single, ``Holla Holla,'' is a hit
that gurgles with pop dance floor appeal even while it speaks
lyrically to the street corners. But a lot of this lengthy effort
could be placed out on the curb. It's like Ja Rule saw these 20
tracks as 20 opportunities to say ``It's murder'' in a different
way. Once that's accomplished, if the blowhard happens to change
his delivery (``Let's Ride''), stumble upon some impressive
production (``Kl 'Em All'') or actually come up with another
potential hit (``Nz Theme'') _ hey, lucky shots.

   ``Rising Son''
</P>
<P>
   Big Bill Morganfield. Blind Pig.
</P>
<P>
   12 tracks. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   When blues wailer Big Bill Morganfield groans, ``it must be that
same thing'' (that makes a preacher put his Bible down), he mangles
the consonants until it sounds more like ``bust knees of seven.''
So as a former English teacher, he's all washed up. But this debut
CD from the son of the late McKinley Morganfield (better known as
Muddy Waters) shows that as a musician Big Bill is ripe and ready
to rock. A beefy voice, a tight band (including four of Waters'
former sidemen) and bare-bones production (``I Just Keep Lovin'
Her'' sounds like it was recorded in a closet) all produce a
likable opening salvo for this Atlanta resident. Morganfield romps
through a good-time selection of original material and blues
standards, including his dad's cheerful ode ``Champagne and
Reefer,'' and his own droll lament, ``Dead Ass Broke.''

   ``The Soft Bulletin''
</P>
<P>
   The Flaming Lips. Warner Bros.
</P>
<P>
   14 tracks. Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Lead Lip Wayne Coyne and his band mates make pop music that is
both challenging and gorgeous, with a healthy disregard for current
trends. Musical genres as disparate as country and progressive rock
are fodder for the psychedelic soup of ``The Soft Bulletin.'' Each
track is suffused with so much melodic and instrumental invention
that it takes several spins to wrap the mind around it all. There
hasn't been a more sublime song released this year than
``Buggin','' bursting with tunefulness like the overgrown child of
Big Star and XTC. Like fellow New York state residents Mercury Rev,
the Lips have no problem reconciling experimentation and song
craft. With a dearth of new ideas in so much recent music, this
band sounds willing and able to make up for the deficit.

 &HT;    George Jones faces up to `Cold Hard Truth'
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   He's been shot, cut, smashed up in cars and pickled in alcohol.
But if country's most legendary bad boy ever decides to hang up his
guitar, George Jones has a promising second career _ as a
tent-revival preacher.
</P>
<P>
   This new CD, recorded in the weeks before Jones' near-fatal car
accident last spring, is a starkly beautiful package of
cigarette-in-the-ashtray country songs about regret, forgiveness,
redemption and love. Standing on the edge of old age, the
67-year-old Jones takes his stronger-than-ever, lonesome baritone
and exorcises his demons into the microphone.
</P>
<P>
   As in most great country tunes, the lyrics are the narcotic that
sets the hook. In ``Choices,'' he confesses, ``At an early age I
found/I liked drinkin'/

   and I never turned it down.'' (This was the eerie tune Jones was
listening to when he crashed his sport utility vehicle with an open
bottle of vodka on the floorboard.) On ``Bed of Roses,'' he wails,
``Someone is always left behind/when this life closes/So I sit
alone and watch it rain/on our bed of roses.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of album that makes you realize just how far
today's pop-flavored country has strayed from the home place. But
Jones isn't living in the past. He's staring at it, rolling the
mistakes around in his head. As a result, he sings with the
heartfelt insight that only age and experience bring.

   HILLARY _ WEST DAVENPORT, N.Y. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton has been
to New York a dozen times this year as the nation's first lady, but
on today's trip she's a candidate for the Senate. For her first
official campaign appearance, Mrs. Clinton chose the homestead of
the man she hopes to succeed, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. It is
the first stop on what aides describe as a summer-long ``listening
tour'' of the state. (Vejnoska, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   KOSOVO-JOURNAL _ PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ The carnage in Kosovo
was the first story I have covered that was bigger than it looked
on television. In Hurricane Andrew, in 1992, the casualties were
limited and life continued in many parts of Miami. December's
bombing of Iraq provided good televised fireworks, but most Iraqis
were barely inconvenienced. But Kosovo was a story of blind ethnic
hatred -- the poison that germinates with simple bigotry and
transforms so easily into bloodshed. Its ravages are not confinable
to a television screen. The acts of evil were too numerous for a
journalist to report and too vast to escape. (Kaplow, Cox News

 &HT;    Nolte, Coburn add power to `Affliction's' visceral punch
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Affliction'' (R)
</P>
<P>
   If you've got family problems, this is absolutely a must-not see
video.
</P>
<P>
   Adapted and directed by Paul Schrader from the novel by Russell
Banks (the same writer responsible for ``The Sweet Hereafter''), it
stars Nick Nolte as Wade, a small-town lawman who manages to screw
up every relationship in his life. That list includes his
girlfriend (Sissy Spacek), ex-wife (Mary Beth Hurt) and daughter
(Brigid Tierney), whom he manages to misunderstand or disappoint
with startling regularity. Already poised on the brink of violent
delusion, things get worse when a hunting accident brings out
Wade's paranoia. It doesn't help that he has a killer toothache.
</P>
<P>
   Nolte was justly nominated for a best actor Oscar, and unjustly
(like Ian McKellen in ``Gods and Monsters'') was overlooked in
favor of that Benigni fellow. But his portrait of a man
disintegrating from the inside out is unforgettable.
</P>
<P>
   So is James Coburn's Oscar-winning turn as Wade's abusive,
drunken dad, the source of all his son's problems. Though the movie
is a little sloppily shaped (compounded by an out-of-place
voice-over narration by Willem Dafoe, playing Nolte's brother),
``Affliction'' is still a terrific, feel-bad movie. (VHS priced for
rental; available on DVD, $29.98.) Grade: B+

   &QR;  ``Hilary and Jackie'' (R) _ Never quite hitting its intended
crescendo, this real-life psychological drama about the
relationship between two musical sisters still strikes some major
chords. Emily Watson (``Breaking the Waves'') stars as Jacqueline
du Pre, a world-famous cellist who died in 1987 of multiple
sclerosis. Rachel Griffiths plays her sister, Hilary, who swapped a
career for cozy domesticity. The mystical finale makes up for a lot
of the unfilled-in blanks that come before it. (VHS

second-rate animated King of Siam really need to high-five the paw
of his pet black leopard? This king's now got a hot-air balloon to
fly around in and swoops into action when somebody's about to
drown. Kids will probably be charmed. For everybody else, it's a
puzzlement. Grade: D+

armadillo armor. It takes eons for ``Wing,'' based on the popular
computer game, to get to the first big dogfight. Grade: D+

CHINA VS. USA: REMEMBER, IT'S ONLY A GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM WONG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Saturday's final game in the Women's World Cup
between the United States and China ought to be sporting
entertainment at its finest.
</P>
<P>
   Our world being what it is, however, it could also be the latest
loyalty test for Chinese Americans and perhaps many other Asian
Americans. The question of whether Chinese Americans are loyal to
the United States has cropped up in the news media glare over
suspicions that a Chinese-American scientist may have illegally
passed U.S. nuclear secrets to China.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, the question lurked in the foreground when a
handful of Chinese Americans were accused of illegally soliciting
or funneling hundreds of thousands of dollars from Asian sources to
President Clinton's 1996 presidential campaign and to the
Democratic Party. On the basis of the alleged spy scandal and the
campaign finance dust-up, many Chinese Americans and other Asian
Americans feel the ripple effect of the complicated post-Cold War
political atmosphere in which China looms as the new Evil Empire
for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Now we have the potential of a women's soccer game serving as a
metaphor for allegiance to national interests.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. women's team has caught the American public's
imagination. It is the embodiment of gender equality in American
sports. Its image is that of a selfless team of mature athletes, in
sharp contrast to the greedy petulance of athletes playing, say,
professional basketball or tennis. The Chinese women's team, much
less well-known to Americans, is said by soccer analysts to be
quick and fast. This would not be the first time that athletic
teams representing different nations have worn the mantle of
political and cultural nationalism. It happens every four years at
the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   Purists say sport should be sport and politics politics and
never the twain meet. Purists do not live in the real world. In the
United States, athletes of Asian descent are still relatively rare,
although growing in numbers. The most famous today are golfers
Tiger Woods (who has Asian, African, and European bloodlines) and
Se Re Pak, ice skaters Kristi Yamaguchi and Michelle Kwan, tennis
player Michael Chang, baseball players Hideo Nomo and Hideki Irabu.
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing stereotypes about people of Asian descent are
that we are small, short, mathematically and scientifically gifted,
unsexy and unathletic. We are sometimes thought to be invisible,
despite our growing visibility in all lines of endeavor, athletics
included.
</P>
<P>
   It is with those stereotypes in mind that the viewpoints of a
few Chinese Americans I have talked with about the forthcoming
U.S.-China women's soccer game make for provocative fare. My survey
was totally unscientific and, consequently, has a huge margin of
error. But it is nonetheless reflective of reality and truth. One
Chinese-American woman said she is rooting for the Chinese team
because ethnic Chinese people in the United States have rarely
gotten recognition for their achievements.
</P>
<P>
   Another Chinese-American woman said she would root for both
teams as a sign of international friendship. She said she has a
friend who is an accomplished soccer player, but she also wants to
cheer for the Chinese team out of cultural identity and because
Asians have such a low profile in this country.
</P>
<P>
   A Chinese-American man had an interesting twist. He said if the
United States went to war against China, he would be loyal to the
United States. But on the matter of the upcoming soccer game, he
will be cheering on the Chinese team based on physical
characteristics he shares with its players and not with the
American players (all of whom are white except for the goalie who
is black).
</P>
<P>
   He does not view his support of the Chinese team as an act of
disloyalty to the United States. ``It's only a game, an
entertainment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope Chinese Americans who root for the Chinese team won't
be branded as disloyal in what, after all, is truly only a game,
not life and death or a matter of national security.

BUSINESSES ARE LOSERS IN THE X GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Three days after the X Games street luge event
was over, Alan Young was not surprised to find two ESPN trailers
still taking up space in a small parking lot off Point Lobos
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me they would have everything out of here by Sunday
night, but they didn't,'' Young said. ``That's typical of the way
it's been since they first told us of their proposal to close the
street.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of San Franciscans and millions of ESPN viewers may
have viewed the extreme sports X Games as totally awesome and cool.
Young wishes they'd never come near him or his business.
</P>
<P>
   A retail gifts dealer, Young has owned the souvenir shop at the
Cliff House for 26 years. Only once before, he said, did an event
close Point Lobos and Lincoln Highway: ``Streets of San Francisco''
spent a day filming there.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was at least 15 years ago,'' he said. ``They gave me a
check for $1,000, which didn't make up for the lost day (of
business), but it did make my expenses. I didn't have to lay
anybody off.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so with the four-day closure for the X Games. Business was
so bad, Young told three of his five employees to stay home.
</P>
<P>
   Tour buses _ the life blood of his business _ could not get down
the street to make their Cliff House stop. Tourists in private cars
couldn't get near the place either.
</P>
<P>
   ``The week before, during the same four-day period, we took in
$15,447,'' Young said. ``The four days that ESPN closed the street,
we did $5,337.44.''
</P>
<P>
   And much of that came from selling faux X Games T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   On March 25, 1998, a week after Mayor Willie Brown announced
that he was making a ferocious bid for the '99 X Games, ESPN
officials met with business owners in the Cliff House area. (The
city already had made space available for ESPN's planning offices
on Treasure Island.) A few days later, Young got a letter from Tim
Reed, the X Games operations manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``The X Games organization is very sincere about making this
event work for you,'' Reed wrote. ``We are more than willing to do
everything in our power to make this a positive experience for all
of the businesses and residents in the greater Richmond area.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed asked for a personal meeting ``in the very near future ...
in order to assure that every detail regarding your establishment
is addressed. The X Games organization prides itself on superb
planning and we want nothing to be overlooked.''
</P>
<P>
   In April, Young said, an ESPN executive paid him a visit and
Young reemphasized his dependence on tour bus access. ESPN's
proposed solution _ golf carts to ferry bus passengers a few blocks
down to the Cliff House _ was unworkable because buses only stop
for 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Young said, ESPN held more informational public
meetings. An associate attended one and told Young, ``It was just
like the first one.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the weeks Young said he called ESPN at least five times and
left messages. No one called back. He sent a certified letter. Then
a Fed Ex. Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Young said, ESPN called a meeting for June 18.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced that the street closing ``proposal'' had never been in
doubt, Young wrote asking for an $18,000 deposit against whatever
money he might lose during the four days.
</P>
<P>
   He was told he ``should have written this letter weeks ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed did not return two messages I left for him, but, in all
fairness, he and the ESPN staff were deep into staging and
broadcasting the games.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one of Young's business neighbors, Ralph Burgin, the
general manager of the Cliff House restaurant, said he found ESPN
``very accommodating.'' Every night X Games workers cleared the
area of luge ``walls'' so the restaurant could have its parking
back. On a Saturday afternoon, they allowed a wedding party with 40
cars to drive down and unload.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe they want to come back next year,'' Burgin said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, the Cliff House barely broke even and wouldn't
have done that well if he hadn't sold food from stands on the
street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our waiters were very unhappy,'' Burgin said.
</P>
<P>
   Young admits that he can be cranky, but he swears, ``I don't
really jump up and down just to jump up and down.''
</P>
<P>
   He just finds it ironic that the X Games are sold to cities as
great for business yet he, a longtime San Francisco business owner,
``got shafted.''

REALITY CHECKS THAT DON'T BOUNCE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If you want a reality check in Cleveland or
Chicago, you probably talk to a machinist or meatpacker on the next
bar stool. How do you do a reality check in San Francisco, the city
where reality checks bounce?
</P>
<P>
   Basically, you have to check into all kinds of people's reality.
</P>
<P>
   One of my reality checks is occasionally having breakfast with
Wally Shore. He's a retired typesetter and jack of all trades who
lives on Social Security with his cat and his library of hundreds
of books in a government-subsidized hotel at the corner of Jones
and Eddy.
</P>
<P>
   Shore has managed, against heavy odds, to construct a decent
life for himself at this most dangerous and substance-addled of all
San Francisco corners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a containment zone,'' Shore said. ``People who hang out
there can do whatever they want to each other as long as they don't
do it to others.''
</P>
<P>
   We went up to the Olympic Cafe on Geary, where you can get diner
food of the genuine non-Fog City type delivered by a waitress named
Hedy, who makes you feel like a million bucks, the way a genuine
diner waitress should.
</P>
<P>
   Shore and I talked about the lives of those without a million
bucks in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   We talked about how badly kids are educated in this town and
elsewhere in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's on purpose,'' Shore said. ``They don't want them to get
smart. They want them to get just smart enough, just literate
enough to be computer literate so they can sit in a cubicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Data entry is the new ditch-digging,'' said this one-time
ditch-digger.
</P>
<P>
   We talked about life in his hotel. He said that recently he
dialed 911 and the emergency operator grilled him for minutes
before sending an ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man had a long medical history and many things wrong with
him, but they didn't want to send an ambulance because of the
address,'' Shore said. ``They thought he might just be drunk.''
</P>
<P>
   Shore told of woman he knew who was kicked out of a drug rehab
center because she kissed a guy in the lobby. Shore said busybodies
inflated it to an orgy, and she was immediately kicked out, with no
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   So you get the picture. If you're down and out in San Francisco,
you're not only short of money or lack a place to live, but you get
no trust, privacy or other human considerations.
</P>
<P>
   Shore pulled out some newspaper clips on the proposal that the
city issue vouchers for room and board instead of cash to those on
General Assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vouchers, another controlling insult for the poor,'' said
Shore, who is not on General Assistance himself. ``The presumption
is that the poor are spending money on booze and drugs. What about
money to get around?''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the Department of Human Services says that more than
half of welfare recipients have a medical disability other than
substance abuse. Lord help them if they have to buy prescription
drugs on their income.
</P>
<P>
   One hotel owner has claimed that sometimes thousands of hotel
rooms go empty at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not likely,'' said Shore. ``We probably have a thousand fewer
rooms because of recent fires.''
</P>
<P>
   Shore and I talked about dozens of subjects under the fog.
</P>
<P>
   One thing he said struck home: ``I keep hearing a lot of talk
about `ordinary people' and `regular people,' as if the poor and
the rich aren't regular people.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ___ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In other reality checks: On Friday, a welfare-to-work street
sweeper gave me a big ``Good morning,'' and I asked him if San
Franciscans were still slobs. ``You wouldn't believe it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look what I found today.''
</P>
<P>
   He held up a pair of handcuffs (gay parade litter or a sign of
lax police work?) and said, ``I've got to get a real job.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ___ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rashad Williams, a student at Archbishop Riordan High School in
San Francisco, recently delivered $18,000 he raised by running the
Bay to Breakers race to Lance Kirklin, the student who was badly
wounded at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a news report on Rashad's trip, a single donor gave
$15,000 to Lance's medical fund.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Lance and his father will head to the San Francisco
area to visit Rashad and his family. On July 18, Rashad will throw
out the first pitch to Lance when the Oakland A's play the Colorado
Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes reality is very good indeed. A production company even
has talked to Rashad's mom about making a reality-based television
movie.
</P>

   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Sometime in mid-January, a farmer in West
Flanders noticed that some of his chicken eggs had failed to hatch.
</P>
<P>
   From the ones that did hatch emerged deformed chicks. He called
a veterinary inspector, who had the eggs and chicks tested. To the
inspector's shock, the tests revealed dioxin -- a notorious
carcinogen -- in concentrations several hundred times greater than
accepted levels. Thus began what some Belgians call
``Chicken-Gate,'' a complex affair that helped bring down a
government and ended the career of a veteran prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   It also set off a chain of events that so far has cost
Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Co. $60 million and incalculable damage to
its image.
</P>
<P>
   The Belgian food scandal, which is highlighted by nightly news
footage of piles of pink chicken and pig carcasses buried in pits,
has reverberated far beyond the borders of this country of 10
million.
</P>
<P>
   Across Europe fears about food and drink have become a potent
force in the '90s, dividing nations, terminating political careers
and making every sip and bite an unappetizing source of
contemplation.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Coca-Cola with a lapse in quality control sufficient
enough to make some of its bottles and cans to smell and taste like
rotten eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Coke's misadventure came with the a public in near panic and a
discredited government grasping for the appearance of competence
and honesty.
</P>
<P>
   These virtues seemed sorely missing in the government's handling
of the dioxin crisis, which came to light months after the initial
discovery when the news was broken by a television reporter. The
level of outrage among the public simmered to full boil by late
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Voters vented their fury at the polls June 13, ending the
government of Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene(CQ, the respected
politician who held together a fractious coalition for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the crisis, government ministers dropped like dinner
chickens. In late May with the chaos in full blossom, Luc Van den
Bossche, a dour, battle-tested bureaucrat and deputy prime
minister, was assigned to fill the vacant posts atop the ministries
of environment, social affairs and health.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after the chain-smoking former prosecutor was
parachuted in to sort out the mess, the Coca-Cola file hit his
desk.
</P>
<P>
   On June 8, a dozen students at a Catholic school in the
prosperous town of Bornem were taken to a local hospital
complaining of vomiting, nausea and headaches after drinking small
bottles of Coca-Cola during their late morning break.
</P>
<P>
   During the day another 21 kids trickled in; and overnight six
arrived at the hospital. Fifteen of the 39 were admitted.
</P>
<P>
   A Belgian Coca-Cola executive came to the school in the
afternoon after getting a call from its headmaster. Samples were
gathered and dispatched to labs in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The next day the company faxed a letter to the school
acknowledging that the illnesses may have had something to do with
its products.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, eight students at a school in Brugge, a favorite
tourist destination, reported getting sick after drinking Coke
products. This incident prompted Van den Bossche to pay closer
attention.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, 30 students of about the same age in the town of
Lochristi 20 miles away from Bornem reported similar symptoms after
drinking cans of Cokes and Coke products from a vending machine.
They were transported by ambulance to Ghent, the largest city in
the region.
</P>
<P>
   Images of retching children being rushed to hospitals were
featured on the evening news.
</P>
<P>
   Similar reports began to flood the government -- 112 students
from five schools reported they were getting sick after drinking
Coke products.
</P>
<P>
   In Van den Bossche's office, it was becoming obvious that the
Belgian government had a potential new crisis on its hands. ``I'm
eating dioxin and drinking Coca-Cola,'' said one bureaucrat as the
new crisis joined the old one.
</P>
<P>
   Coke began withdrawing some of its products, but the reports of
illnesses persisted. In all, 249 people sought medical attention in
Belgium for symptoms they associated with drinking Coke products.
</P>
<P>
   In the first week, government officials complained that Coke was
neither sensitive to the government's position nor forthcoming with
explanations.
</P>
<P>
   On June 14, a clearly exasperated Van den Bossche surprised
everyone by banning the sale of all Coca-Cola products until
someone could tell him out why all these people were getting sick.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, he was telling aides that the soft drink company
deserved what it was getting for not being more open and failing to
understand the sensitivity of public sentiments about food safety.
</P>
<P>
   Van den Bossche also found it irritating and arrogant that Coke
would not divulge its secret formula, which raised suspicions that
something may have gone awry with the syrup.
</P>
<P>
   Very early on, an advisory panel of doctors advised him that the
Coca-Cola crisis could be explained as a mass psychosomatic
reaction -- now the broadly accepted explanation -- but he was
unwilling to risk the wrath of Belgian parents by telling them that
it was all in their children's heads.
</P>
<P>
   He also expressed concern about appearing soft on the American
corporate giant. ``Coca Cola is a big company, it's a symbol, it's
the United States,'' said Michel de Muelenaere, the home news
editor for the national daily Le Soir.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it soon became clear that government scientists, who tested
the beverages for 15,000 toxins, could find nothing to warrant a
continued ban. Coca-Cola provided its own explanation that the
bottles had become contaminated with sulfur-laced carbon dioxide
gas and the cans had come in contact with a fungicide on wooden
pallets. Neither substance was found in high enough levels to
explain the symptoms, adding credence for the psychosomatic theory.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, to the vexation of Coke executives assembled in a war room
at the company's suburban Brussels plant, Van den Bossche agreed
only to ease but not lift the restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the minister feared to lose face,'' said Benoit
Nemery, a toxicologist and a member of the government's advisory
team of doctors. ``After being so radical, it would have been very
difficult for him to say, 'Sorry, that wasn't really necessary.'''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as the air of suspicion continued in Belgium other
countries either joined in restricting Coke products -- as in the
case of France -- or took pains to reassure their citizens that
Coke products sold in their countries were safe.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, Coke had a full-scale crisis on its hands.
</P>
<P>
   While executives in Belgium seemed to understand the perilous
environment in Europe, the situation seemed to be grasped slowly by
Coca-Cola executives in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the ban was enacted, Coke finally responded in a
big public way with chairman Douglas Ivester issuing an apologetic
statement. Two days after that, Ivester arrived in Brussels to
focus his personal attention on the crisis -- 10 days after it
began.
</P>
<P>
   Philippe Lenfant, a Belgian Coca-Cola executive, said the
company perhaps reacted too slowly. ``I admit we perhaps lost
control of the situation to a certain extent,'' Lenfant said during
a television interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a crisis-management strategy,'' Lenfant said. ``But
the crisis was bigger than any worst-case scenario we could have
imagined. The first couple of days of the crisis we didn't know
(the cause), and I humbly admit that we should have said so more
clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   The ban was lifted June 23, even though Van den Bossche lamented
that no one had yet given him sufficient explanation as to why so
many people fell ill.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Atlantans could be forgiven for failing to master
the mind-numbing nuances of Belgian politics -- one frustrated Coke
executive observed: ``You don't have to have banana trees to have a
banana republic.'' -- or comprehend that the concern over food
already bordered on hysteria.
</P>
<P>
   The dioxin scare is only the most recent in a series of such
crises involving European governments and failures either to
adequately inform the public of a risk or to color the truth enough
to lose all credibility. After the mad-cow disease scare in
Britain, occasional bouts of e-coli, fears over hormone-laced beef
from the United States and even aspersions of beef blood
derivatives used in French wine, consumers don't know what to
believe.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, consumers for months have had to eat breakfast
contending with newspaper reports on the creeping threat of
Genetically Modified food -- called ``Frankenstein Food'' by
tabloid headline writers.
</P>
<P>
   The public rejection of such foods has been intense -- even
though they are common in the United States and have not been shown
to pose any health threats. Two major European food producers
decided to capitalize on the concern. Nestle and Unilever are
introducing lines of ``GM-free'' foods, while other companies have
decided to pull their products containing these genetically
modified foods from store shelves.
</P>
<P>
   All this has created an atmosphere both complex and hostile for
companies such as Coca-Cola, to whom image is everything.
</P>
<P>
   Had this all occurred before that farmer observed the problems
with his eggs and chicks, Coke's problems would have been greatly
reduced, said Muelenaere, the Le Soir editor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been something because it is Coca-Cola,'' said
De Muelenaere, whose newspaper featured Coke stories side-by-side
the dioxin stories for a week last month. ``But you would not have
seen the government behave as aggressively as it did or the media
causing so much -- I don't want to use the word 'hysteria' --
interest.''

   All this has created an atmosphere both complex and hostile for
companies such as Coca-Cola, to whom image is everything.
</P>
<P>
   Had this all occurred before that farmer observed the problems
with his eggs and chicks, Coke's problems would have been greatly
reduced, said Muelenaere, the Le Soir editor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been something because it is Coca-Cola,'' said
De Muelenaere, whose newspaper featured Coke stories side-by-side
the dioxin stories for a week last month. ``But you would not have
seen the government behave as aggressively as it did or the media
causing so much -- I don't want to use the word 'hysteria' --
interest.''

SCOTLAND: WHERE THE PAST MEETS THE PRESENT

<P>
   EDINBURGH, Scotland _ Precisely at 1 p.m. Monday through
Saturday, a cannon booms from the windy ramparts of Edinburgh
Castle.
</P>
<P>
   Residents can set their watches by the cannon blast as they
stroll among the shops on busy Princes Street, 425 feet below. The
gunfire _ blanks, of course _ has been tradition since 1861, when
ships used it to set their chronometers before leaving the River
Forth. (The gun was fired at 1 p.m. instead of noon because it was
cheaper, and quieter, to fire one round instead of a dozen.)
</P>
<P>
   Today, ship crews no longer need to listen for the cannon to set
their clocks, and most residents probably set their watches by the
radio or a clock at home.
</P>
<P>
   But the tradition continues. It's a fitting symbol for Scotland,
a land where past and present blend as smoothly as a barrel of fine
Scotch whiskey.
</P>
<P>
   There's still a wee bit of the Highland rebel in the hearts of
many loyal Scots. The movies ``Rob Roy'' and ``Braveheart,'' both
profiles of Scots who rebelled against the English, were hits here
as well as in the United States, and helped boost tourism in
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Queen of Scots, who defied Elizabeth I of England and
eventually lost her head for it, is remembered fondly here.
</P>
<P>
   On May 12, Scotland made modern history by reconvening its
Parliament after an absence of 292 years and Queen Elizabeth II
presided over the formal opening of the Parliament on July 1. The
Scottish Parliament was dissolved in 1707 and Scotland became part
of Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's the spirit of independence that charms visitors
from the United States, which had its own struggles with the
British. But more likely, it's the green hills, the rocky Highland
crags and the friendly people, and their wonderful accent.
</P>
<P>
   All that, and the 500-plus golf courses in the country most
commonly associated with the origin of the game. And the 100-plus
whiskey distilleries, many producing varieties you can't find
anywhere but Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Avid golfers can book a golfing tour of Scotland through a
travel agent or buy a golfing pass from tourist agencies in
Scottish towns. These passes, which start at about 50 British
pounds ($85 U.S.) entitle the holder to play on a variety of
courses in the area for a specific number of days.
</P>
<P>
   St. Andrews, the most famous course in Scotland and perhaps in
the world, will be the site of the British Open on July 20-23,
2000. It's located in the town of the same name, north of
Edinburgh.
</P>
<P>
   There actually are two St. Andrews courses _ the Old Course (par
72), founded around 1400, and the New Course (par 71), opened in
1895. And there are five other courses in the immediate area.
</P>
<P>
   Some American golfers say St. Andrews is a bit rough for their
taste, and experts advise that you make reservations at least a
year in advance if you want to play the Old Course. But other
courses at St. Andrews and elsewhere, such as the four at the
Gleneagles resort northwest of Edinburgh, have easier access. And
even small rural courses are well-kept and often challenging.
</P>
<P>
   The large Gleneagles hotel complex includes other diversions _
shooting, falconry, a spa and exercise area and two
off-road-vehicle courses.
</P>
<P>
   We found the falconry particularly interesting. Harris hawks are
used to hunt rabbits and birds in the surrounding woods. If you
don't want to hunt, you can don a thick leather glove and have one
of the birds fly from a nearby perch to land on your wrist. Despite
their size, the hawks only weigh about 1 1/2 pounds because they're
mostly feathers and their bones are hollow.
</P>
<P>
   When it's time for a drink, you'll find a wide variety of Scotch
whiskeys in the restaurants and pubs. The Scotch Whiskey Heritage
Center, on the Royal Mile just outside the Edinburgh Castle gate,
has a store stocking numerous varieties, and there's also a bar
where you can do your own sampling. If you want something more
elaborate, you can reserve a tasting session with a member of the
center staff.
</P>
<P>
   Our tasting session was educational and fun. First, we were
given 10 small glass bottles, each containing a cotton ball
drenched with a different scent.
</P>
<P>
   We were told to write down the name of each substance as a test
of our ``nosing'' ability. Most of us got only a few right.
</P>
<P>
   After that, we tasted three varieties of Scotch, from a light,
almost lemony variety to a heavy, smoky brand. It's safe to say
that all of us were in an excellent mood by the time we finished.
</P>
<P>
   A tour of the center explaining how Scotch is made costs the
equivalent of about $4.25 for children, $6 for students and $8.50
for adults. A tasting costs about $9.35 _ adults only.
</P>
<P>
   If you want a closer look at the process of making what the
Scots sometimes call ``the water of life,'' you can visit some of
the distilleries and get a free tasting at the end of the tour.
</P>
<P>
   We visited Glenturret distillery, near Crieff in Central
Scotland. It's the country's oldest highland malt distillery,
established in 1775.
</P>
<P>
   It's also one of the smallest, with the production handled by
only six people. Glenturret is along what's known as the Malt
Whiskey Trail, a 70-mile route featuring eight distilleries.
</P>
<P>
   At Glenturret, you can walk from room to room, following the
distilling process. Early on, the mixture foams and smells like
beer in huge wooden vats. After fermenting for two days, it's tubed
to the giant copper distillery next door. The liquid goes through
distillation twice, and the best of it eventually winds up in oak
casks for aging.
</P>
<P>
   Like wine, the older whiskey is, the better. Glenturret whiskey
is sold in lots of 12, 15, 18, 21, 25 and 27 years, with the oldest
being the most expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Whiskey isn't the only product made in Scotland. You can buy
bagpipes (prices start at around $1,000 for a basic model) or a
wool kilt in any of the popular clan tartans. Some shops even offer
rental tartans for dressy occasions _ the Scottish equivalent of
the tuxedo.
</P>
<P>
   Scottish woolens are considered particularly fine, which is not
surprising in a country that has more than twice as many sheep as
humans _ 14 million sheep to 5 million people.
</P>
<P>
   At the Scottish Wool Center in Aberfoyle, north of Glasgow,
visitors can get an idea of what it's like to breed and raise
sheep, herd them with the help of Shetland sheepdogs and harvest
their wool each year. The center opened in 1992 and has separate
visitors' programs for summer and winter.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the things we learned from the humorous (and often
earthy) talk were:
</P>
<P>
   _ One shepherd now looks after about 1,200 sheep, twice as many
as in times past. The dogs help, fixing the sheep with a gimlet
gaze that dares them to disobey.
</P>
<P>
   _ Once a ewe is impregnated, owners use sonograms to determine
the number of lambs she's carrying. Then they mark the ewe's head
with a color indicating that number.
</P>
<P>
   _ A contract shearer can clip 400 bleating, wriggling sheep a
day.
</P>
<P>
   One other thing we learned at the center is how much fun it is
to shop there. I couldn't resist a plush mohair cardigan.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the other attractions, one of the most pleasurable
pastimes in Scotland is simply walking through the countryside. One
of the most beautiful areas is the Trossachs in Central Scotland.
The hills, green much of the year, turn purple in August when the
heather blooms. There are many trails where you can take off on
your own or with a group, enjoying the scenery and the silence.
</P>
<P>
   And one other thing _ take lots of film if you go to Scotland.
You'll need it.

CLANS EVOKE HISTORY OF BRAVURA AND ROMANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KAREN DAVIS  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWTYLE, Scotland _ Scottish clans are the stuff of romance.
That's evident from the popularity of historical romantic novels
with Scottish themes and films such as ``Rob Roy,'' and the
television's time-traveling ``Highlander'' series.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Gregor MacGregor knows all about the bloody battles between
rival clans.
</P>
<P>
   His own clan was so warlike that from 1603 to 1776, it was
proscribed by the English. ``This meant all our lands were forfeit
and it was illegal to bear the MacGregor name,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the MacGregor clan survived by dodging the authorities.
They were known as ``the children of the mist'' because of their
ability to execute lightning-quick raids on English troops and then
melt back into the misty mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Today, MacGregor is the chief of his clan, a title that holds
considerably less clout than it did in the past, when the loyalty
of clan members to their chief was absolute. He lives in a historic
manor house set amid manicured grounds _ a far cry from the days
when clan members were on the run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the figurehead of this clan,'' he said. ``I get an
enormous amount of correspondence from MacGregors spread far and
wide _ New Zealand, Australia, Canada and the United States. Many
of them want to know if they're descended from Rob Roy.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob Roy was an 18th-century Scotsman who rebelled against
English rule, which made him a hero to many, including some in
Hollywood a few years ago. (Liam Neeson starred in the film.)
Although MacGregor is very proper and proud of his heritage as the
descendent of numerous clan chiefs, he admits he's seen the movie
``Rob Roy'' and enjoyed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good wild Western set in Scotland,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Is he a Rob Roy descendent?
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course not,'' he said. ``He was a younger son.''
</P>
<P>
   Tradition holds that Gregor MacGregor is descended from Robert,
the fourth son of King Alfred, who ruled Scotland in the 700s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't prove it, but we are finding out that many of the
myths are true,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he's a member of the Standing Council of Clan Chiefs.
There are 147 recognized Scottish clans. The council meets each
July to discuss such things as preventing exploitation of clan
tartans and names, which is considered a serious offense in
Scotland. It's hard to go anywhere here without seeing clan tartan
items in stores, from key chains to caps to cloth. They're great
favorites with tourists, but the clan chiefs want to make sure the
right people are producing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned with keeping things valid,'' MacGregor said.
``In Scotland, the law lays down strict procedures. You have to get
permission. If you use somebody else's name (without permission),
it's a crime, even if you don't make money from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorized clan items have a log _ a circle with three feathers.
Royalties from the sale of such items go to the clan chiefs'
council, MacGregor said.
</P>
<P>
   MacGregor said he can't answer queries form from MacGregors
hoping to establish their ancestry because he hasn't the time and
or resources. He notes, however, that there are other sources of
information, especially on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A recent check via the AltaVisa search engine netted more than 3
million Web pages on Scottish clans, from general information to
sites on specific clans such as Douglas, Campbell, Bruce and
MacNeil. The MacGregor clan alone has more than 800,000 sites.
</P>
<P>
   All of which has not been lost on the members of the Standing
Council of Clan Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although we usually meet only once a year, we're planning a
special meeting to discuss such things as the Internet,' MacGregor
said.
</P>

KERREY REINFORCES MAVERICK STATUS WITH BRaDLEY ENDORSEMENT 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You don't have to be a fan of Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey to
appreciate his taste for the unconventional, to savor his droll
disregard for the demands of political propriety.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, I am a Kerrey fan _ to the extent that I'm ever a
fan of a liberal Democrat. Kerrey was my first choice for the
Democratic nomination when he ran for president in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey was relegated to also-ran status that year as he watched
Bill Clinton steal his major issue, health care, en route to the
Democratic nomination and the presidency. Kerrey exacted revenge by
becoming a thorn in Clinton's side almost from the moment the new
president took office in 1993, challenging his initiatives in
Congress and often criticizing him in public.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Vietnam war hero who romanced actress Debra Winger
while he was governor of the Cornhusker State has affronted the
Clinton administration again _ this time by endorsing Vice
President Al Gore's opponent for the Democrats' 2000 presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The value of Kerrey's support for former Senate colleague Bill
Bradley is mostly symbolic, since Kerrey commands no large bloc of
primary voters and is generally viewed as a minimally influential
maverick in the Senate. But the symbolism is nonetheless
significant.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey may not be one of the most powerful Democrats in
Washington, but he is one of the best known. He is articulate,
outspoken and unpredictable _ all traits that earn him frequent
appearances on the political gabfests that dominate the TV dial on
Sunday mornings. With Kerrey in his corner, Bradley will score lots
of free plugs on ``Meet the Press'' and ``Face the Nation.
</P>
<P>
   What we can't know, of course, is whether Kerrey has sided with
Bradley because he truly believes that the onetime basketball star
would be a better Democratic nominee and/or president than Gore or
because Kerrey couldn't resist the chance to give the Clinton-Gore
team additional grief.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey does have a reputation for following his conscience in
making important decisions, so he probably ought to get the benefit
of the doubt on this one. Let's say he endorsed Bradley because it
was the right thing to do _ and that knifing Clinton-Gore in the
back was just a bonus.
</P>
<P>
   None of which addresses the question of Bradley's viability as
the alternative to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, are Democratic voters really looking for an
alternative to Gore? It would be highly unusual for the party to
reject a sitting vice president's bid to head the ticket _
especially the bid of a vice president whose administration has
presided over nearly eight years of spectacular economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's detractors are quick to point out _ and his supporters
readily admit _ that the vice president is a
less-than-scintillating campaigner. Plunk him down on a stage next
to Bradley, though, and Gore could suddenly look like a veritable
ball of fire.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was one of the great basketball players in the history
of the sport and he was an excellent U.S. senator. But the name
``Bill Bradley'' will turn up in the same sentence with the word
``charisma'' only when the purpose of the sentence is to make the
point that Bradley has no charisma.
</P>
<P>
   Should Bradley ever maneuver Gore into a one-on-one debate, the
audience might yawn itself into a coma.
</P>
<P>
   Which might be exactly the reaction Bradley has been looking for
with his low-key, long-shot campaign. Bradley's game plan could
well be to lull Gore and the Democratic establishment to sleep
while quietly going about the business of raising money and lining
up support outside the usual political channels.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of Bill Bradley overtaking Al Gore to win the
Democratic nomination for president does seem far-fetched. Well,
OK, it seems preposterous.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Bob Kerrey had the foresight to identify
health care as the next big thing long before that issue became a
national obsession. Is it possible that Kerrey has seen something
in Bradley's campaign _ or Gore's _ that the rest of us have
missed?

AS LOSSES MOUNT, EXPOS LOOK SOUTH TO CHARLOTTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM REYNOLDS  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ At first glance, the scene seems normal enough. About
50 people, many of them donning team caps, jerseys and T-shirts,
are standing at a ticket window, trying to gain entry to Olympic
Stadium to watch their Montreal Expos play the Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   They are here to watch their former star, Pedro Martinez, pitch
for Boston against the Expos. And they are growing impatient with
the wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``The service is not adequate,'' Sylvain Jade, a 20-year-old
student from Laval, says in English that's clouded by a thick
Quebecois accent. ``How are the rest of the ticket windows
unopened? I think they do not want us here.''
</P>
<P>
   Only two windows were staffed for game-night sales. Once they've
secured their tickets, fans are literally running from the window
through the turnstiles, because at this point, the game is 55
minutes old. The fourth inning has started.
</P>
<P>
   There is a growing sense in Montreal that the Expos organization
is knowingly, willingly and gladly sabotaging baseball at Olympic
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The mission, these people believe, is twofold _ low attendance
could help the club convince voters that a new stadium must be
built for it in downtown Montreal, or the franchise will be sold
and relocated, probably to Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers in Montreal have been reporting for nearly a year
that Expos general partner and president Claude Brochu is
attempting to sell the team to Charlotte businessman Don Beaver.
Charlotte is already home to the NBA's Hornets and NFL's Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   The attendance figures at Olympic Stadium are by far the worst
in baseball, perhaps because the National League team has one of
the worst records in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   At its current pace, the Expos will draw 711,909 fans this
season, or more than 200,000 fewer than last year's total of
914,909.
</P>
<P>
   The salad days of the franchise, like when the club drew 2.4
million in 1983, are as forgotten as the team's baby-blue pullover
road uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a perception, a stereotype, that Montreal sports fans
only care about one sport, that being, of course, hockey,'' said
John Martin, a Montreal-based free-lance writer and self-described
baseball historian. ``It's true that hockey is the best game in
town, but fans of sport want baseball here. They want to see the
McGwires, the Sosas, the Bonds ... and they want to have something
to be proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto Blue Jays, Canada's other major-league franchise,
also are dealing with a significant drop in ticket sales, despite
the presence of budding stars like Shawn Green and Shannon Stewart,
World Series hero David Wells and Tony Fernandez, who's making a
run at batting .400. Toronto's attendance has dipped 16 percent
this year compared to 1998, but still 24,583 people, on average,
are going to the SkyDome for games.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos would love to have the Blue Jays' problems. Montreal
has broken the 20,000 mark in home attendance once all season _
Opening Day, when 43,918 went to Olympic Stadium to see the Expos
beat the New York Mets, 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   The club made its budget for 1999 based on selling 1 million
tickets, and even allowing for $15 million (U.S. $10.2 million) in
losses, according to published reports. It appears the final tally
could be significantly worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be 15 to 20 percent below our expectations,'' said L.
Jacques Menard, the team's chairman of the board and an advocate of
keeping baseball in Montreal. ``If that happens, it could cause
many millions more in losses.''
</P>
<P>
   Brochu, who declined an interview request for this story, has
laid out his master plan for keeping baseball in Montreal, with the
cornerstone being the construction of Labatt Park, a 35,000-seat
throwback-type stadium to be located in one of the busiest sections
of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Promotional information hyping the planned stadium proclaims
``it will be the most prestigious, the most acclaimed and the most
popular gathering and entertainment venue in Quebec.'' The park
could open as early as 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Brochu's position boils down to this: If the city builds the
stadium, the club will stay; if not, it will go.

<P>
   ``If baseball would swing its weight behind us,'' Expos minority
partner Mark Rutterberg said, ``we could get this done just like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The city, however, sees no reason to invest an estimated $250
million (U.S. $170 million) of tax dollars to build a park for the
sake of keeping a penny-pinching franchise that annually gives away
talent just to keep payroll low.
</P>
<P>
   On this night, though, the only thing moving with certainty was
pencils on scorecards. Pedro Martinez did not leave victorious, as
he and the Red Sox were shelled, 13-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like losing to anyone,'' Martinez said. ``But if I had
to pick one team to lose to, this would be the one.''
</P>
<P>
   There were 19,012 people there to see Martinez, who won the 1997
Cy Young Award in his final season in Montreal. And when the Expos
blew the game open in the late innings, ``le Stade Olympique''
rocked like it was, well, any other major-league park.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the great places to play and see people do
well,'' Montreal infielder Michael Barrett said. ``When (Expos
starter and winner Mike) Thurman came up to bat in the seventh and
everyone was giving him a standing ovation, it was truly
uplifting.''

<P>
   PITTSFIELD, Mass. _ Sitting in the stands at a Jamestown Tigers
game in 1992, anthropologist George Gmelch suddenly had a vision of
himself 30 years before.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind's eye, I saw myself in my old uniform, batting
left-handed, playing first base,'' he said. ``It was incredibly
vivid.''
</P>
<P>
   Gmelch, chairman of the anthropology department at Union College
in Schenectady, N.Y., has made a career of journeys _ to Ireland,
Alaska, Barbados. But by far the longest trek he has made was the
one to baseball and back again.
</P>
<P>
   In two books, ``In the Ballpark: The Working Lives of Baseball
People,'' published in 1998, and the yet-to-be-released ``The Ball
Players: Life and Culture in Professional Baseball,'' he has
trained a scholar's eye on the national pastime.
</P>
<P>
   Getting there wasn't easy. For 25 years after he left the
Detroit Tigers farm team without making it to the big leagues, he
hardly talked about baseball. He wouldn't watch games on television
and gave only a cursory glance to the sports pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was too painful,'' Gmelch, 54, said on a lazy drive
through the Berkshire foothills en route to a Pittsfield Mets game.
``This had been my dream since the eighth grade. Even though most
people thought it was great that I played pro ball, in my mind I
had failed.''
</P>
<P>
   But as his son grew old enough to play Little League, and with
prodding from his wife, Gmelch turned his attention back to the
sport he once loved. And in the process of writing his books,
Gmelch learned what any fan of ``The Natural'' or ``Field of
Dreams'' knows: the redemptive power of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   When he began field research in 1991, he had no theme in mind.
Yet in his portrayals of characters as diverse as the Philly
Phanatic or a beer vendor at Oriole Park at Camden Yards in
Baltimore, reviewers found a common thread in the characters'
obsession for the game.
</P>
<P>
   In writing about their passion, Gmelch rediscovered his own.
</P>
<P>
   As he turns off Route 20, the town of Pittsfield slowly unfolds
with its mosaic of New England church spires and Main Street movie
marquees _ the kind of town he saw countless times as a player.
</P>
<P>
   The ballpark rises out of the downtown like an ancient monument.
Three hours before game time, the rival Staten Island Yankees
arrive at Wahconah Park. The stadium is empty, save for batting
practice, and the wood bleachers audibly creak as Gmelch descends
to the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are few things as wonderful as a well-maintained
baseball field,'' he says. ``The lush greenery. The dark brown mud
of the infield. The perfect white chalk lines ...''
</P>
<P>
   He approaches Mike Baker, the Yankees pitching coach and an
international scout. Gmelch has him musing about what he looks for
in a recruit: ``When I go to Scottsdale, Arizona, or Salt Lake
City, Utah, the players are too comfortable. If they don't have the
blood in their eye, the passion like a bright, hot coal, I'm not
interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Gmelch's demeanor is scholarly, no-nonsense; his tone sometimes
clinical. He has the quiet reserve of one who knows what he's
looking for, and has seen much of it before.
</P>
<P>
   In the stands he finds Jessica Stockam, whose husband, Travis,
is a Mets catcher. Travis is the only married player on the
single-A team, comprised mostly of new draft picks just out of
college and high school. The new book devotes an entire chapter to
the solitary lives of baseball wives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does it get lonely when he's out on the road?'' Gmelch asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you move up in the leagues, there are a lot more wives,''
she says. ``So when the guys go away, the girls get together and
its fun.'' She looks down and becomes suddenly quiet. ``If I can
only make it through the next few years,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back on his life in the mid-1960s, Gmelch saw that he'd
lived in two worlds. Half the time he was a student at Stanford
University, which was in the throes of protests against the Vietnam
War. For the other half, he was living the American pie life of a
minor league ballplayer.
</P>
<P>
   The rooms he shared with teammates were plastered with maps of
towns he'd seen in the Northeast and deep South. The journey had a
special meaning then, before the Walkman and the VCR made bus trips
less communal. On buses that rarely had air conditioning, teammates
played cards and trivia games; a guy inevitably strummed a guitar
and players engaged in repartee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked to look out the window and see tobacco fields, small
towns, orange trees, Cape Canaveral,'' he said. ``There was a real
sense of place.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As part of his research, Gmelch retraced his old route from
spring training camp in Lakeland, Fla. to Rocky Mount, N.C., where
he played during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   As baseball changed, he found, so had America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked by how much like the Northeast it was,'' he said
of his recent cross-country travels. ``The same chains, the same
fast-food places with the same building patterns in every city.
America is a lot more homogenous than it was then.''
</P>
<P>
   It also is more inclusive. Gmelch recalled how some towns in the
South enforced de-facto segregation long after it was outlawed.
</P>
<P>
   It was Gmelch's unforgiving take on Southern racism that helped
bring about the end of his baseball career.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his tenure with the Tigers, Gmelch sent columns on
minor league life home to the now-defunct Burlingame Advance Star
in the San Francisco Bay Area. In one piece, which he now labels a
satire, Gmelch called the local police chief a Ku Klux Klan member
and his brother a Klan grand dragon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had it from a very reliable source,'' he said recently.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the town fathers of Rocky Mount and the Tigers home
office were none too enamored of his wit. It wasn't long before a
libel suit was threatened and he was quietly put on the disabled
list.
</P>
<P>
   Gmelch played ball in Canada for two years before turning to an
academic career in anthropology. Looking back, he acknowledged that
he probably had little chance of making it to the big leagues
anyhow. If journalism hadn't caught up with him, his batting
average would have.

NOW HEAR THIS: LISTENING SKILLS ARE VITAL TO YOUR CAREER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Next time you hear politicians speak, listen to
what they're not saying, former Texas Gov. Ann Richards says. One
thing that Richards didn't say, for example, is that hearing the
unspoken is one of the most useful career skills you can have.
</P>
<P>
   At the recent Women in Leadership conference in San Francisco,
Richards described how Congress debated gun control after the
shootings at Columbine High School in Colorado. Suddenly the
argument shifted to whether the Ten Commandments should be posted
in schools. That, she said, was a deft maneuver by gun control
opponents. Whether they won or lost on the Commandments didn't
matter; they succeeded in shifting the conversation away from gun
control.
</P>
<P>
   In your career, hearing the unspoken helps in these ways:
</P>
<P>
   _ Making tough decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Smart Silicon Valley companies do this all the time to survive.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Intel executives could see that competition made
it hard to succeed in manufacturing memory chips, so they focused
on microprocessors _ and thrived. Apple turned its business around
by cutting its product line.
</P>
<P>
   Those changes weren't popular with existing customers or
employees, groups that are often more comfortable with the status
quo _ until the company goes out of business. The executives were
listening to the unspoken promise of future customers.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's look at an industry in decline: newspapers. Do you
have any idea what draws the most coverage in newspapers? It has to
be the stock market, which gets four or five full pages of price
tables each day.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton could have an affair with O.J. Simpson on the
streets of Kosovo and it wouldn't draw four full pages of coverage
per day.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people don't even own stocks, and many others check
prices through their brokers, the Internet or even automated phone
lines set up by newspapers. But the tables remain.
</P>
<P>
   If you replaced them with five pages of news about businesses
and stories explaining what was happening in the financial markets,
any newspaper's business section would probably be far more
informative and entertaining in six months than it is today.
</P>
<P>
   But those six months would be hell, because readers and
advertisers who prefer the status quo would complain. Loudly. And
those potential new readers who thought the stock tables were a
waste of space wouldn't be saying a word, of course. So the tables
remain.
</P>
<P>
   The status quo is always the easiest alternative. That's why
it's so important to stop at least once a year and evaluate your
career (and life, for that matter).
</P>
<P>
   Are you still happy? Are you still learning? Will society need
your skills in 10 or 20 years? Are there new careers that might
appeal to you? Does your career still fit your values and
lifestyle? How will you be better off a year from now? Whether your
cliche of choice is ``thinking ahead of the curve'' or ``reading
the handwriting on the wall,'' do it. Listen to that voice inside
your head, the one that speaks only when spoken to.
</P>
<P>
   _ Job interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Think about what you really want to find out, besides obvious
things like pay and benefits. What are the chances for promotion or
mentoring? Does the company promote work and family balance or just
give it lip service? Is there a mission statement or five-year
plan? Do employees have a lot of direction or a lot of freedom?
Make sure you address the heart of your question. If your main
concern about balance is making sure you can take your 10-year-old
to her soccer games, don't let that get lost as the company tells
you about its scholarship program.
</P>
<P>
   If you are told that mentoring is offered on a case-by-case
basis, find out the guidelines. You might not get an answer that's
cast in stone, but at least it won't be cast in Jell-O.
</P>
<P>
   For anything crucial, get a direct answer from your future
supervisor. Just because the company emphasizes mentoring doesn't
mean each department considers it important.
</P>
<P>
   _ Salary negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   If you want a raise, show how you've improved in the last year,
what skills you've added and how that has helped the company. If
the boss points out weaknesses, make sure they're not just
distractions.
</P>
<P>
   If you get turned down for relatively insignificant reasons, do
some networking and find out if the boss has deeper, unspoken
concerns about your performance or if the company is having
financial problems. Those will help you determine your next move.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if you're getting a job offer, remember the
adage: Whichever side mentions salary first loses. So try to let
the employer make the first offer.
</P>
<P>
   If you've done your homework, you'll know what a fair offer
should be. If it sounds too low, explain how you stand out from the
typical applicant, and why you should be paid more.
</P>
<P>
   And when you agree on a job offer and salary, get it in writing.
</P>
<P>
   A written contract is always worth a thousand words, spoken or
unspoken.
</P>

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE 
 Includes illustration. 
 Copyright 1999 Bernard Gladstone 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Our house has a gable roof with large louvered vents in the
attic peaks at each end. We always covered these louvers in cold
weather in an effort to save heat, but during the past winter we
noticed some signs of condensation on the exposed roof rafters
inside the attic. We recently increased the amount of insulation on
the floor of that unfinished attic, but a knowledgeable friend
tells me that we should leave the gable vents open at all times. In
addition, in his opinion these vents alone actually did not provide
enough ventilation for that attic. How much ventilation do we
actually need, and if more is needed do we have to make the
existing vents even larger?
</P>
<P>
   A: Most codes require a minimum of one square foot of vent
opening for every 300 square feet of attic floor area _ but half of
these vents should be up near the top of the attic with the other
half down low, usually along the eaves. The best method is to
install a row of ridge vents along the top of the roof as shown
here, coupled with continuous soffit vents along the eaves. This
will allow hot air to flow out at the top, while colder air enters
from below as indicated in the illustration.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The concrete of my garage floor extends about six inches
outside the overhead door when the door is all the way down. This
exposed ``apron'' of concrete is about six inches wide and in one
long area the concrete has been eroded to the point where the
gravel and stones are showing. I believe this was caused by rock
salt being frequently used by the previous owner of this house. How
can I refinish and then preserve or protect this exposed strip of
concrete?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are a number of patching cements sold in home centers
that have bonding agents in them to insure solid adhesion so that
they can be spread on in thin layers that will bond to the old
concrete and gravel. Clean the old surface thoroughly to get rid of
dirt and debris, then mix and spread the patching material
according to the directions on the package. Allow this to cure
fully, then apply a coat of cement sealer to help waterproof the
patched area.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I live in a small condominium where all the apartments have
hardwood floors. Unit owners do not want to cover these floors
because they like the appearance of the hardwood. But noise from
people walking on the wood floors with hard soled shoes, from loud
stereo speakers, and even from squeaky floor boards, is easily
transmitted from one apartment to the one below it. This building
was built in the 1920s and has plaster ceilings. Is there any kind
of good acoustical insulation that can be blown in between the
floors and ceilings to cut down on noise transmission and effective
enough to make it worth the cost?
</P>
<P>
   A: Blowing insulation into the space between the ceilings and
floors will cut down only slightly on the amount of noise
transmitted, so I doubt that this would be worthwhile. Putting down
carpet or rugs would help a lot, as will closing up or caulking all
openings where pipes, electric wires, etc. come through from one
floor to the other.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a bathroom exhaust fan installed that vents into the
attic directly above it. I noticed signs of moisture and was told
the fan should be vented up through the roof of the house. How do I
install such a vent without compromising the watertight seal of my
newly installed roofing material?
</P>
<P>
   A: You don't have to run the vent up through the roof; you only
need to vent it directly to the outside to eliminate the moisture
problem _ rather than into the attic. In most cases the simplest
way to do this is to run the vent out through the nearest wall _ in
the attic or even through the bathroom wall. Either type of
installation would be a lot better than what you have now.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   NOTE: Drawing captioned ``COLD AIR ENTERS THROUGH SOFFIT VENTS''
goes with this column.
</P>
<P>
   CAPTION: For most efficient ventilation air should flow into the
attic at its lowest point, then out through vents at the top of the
attic.

   Home Section stories from The N.Y. Times News Service for
Thursday, July 8:

   OUTDOOR-DESIGN (Undated) _ The craze for picture windows and
patios during the 1950s and '60s that became the gardening
renaissance of the '80s that became the boom in casual outdoor
living in the early 1990s has found its endgame _ outdoor interior
decoration. ``It's gone from furnishing the outdoors to decorating
the outdoors,'' said Bruce Butterfield, research director of the
National Gardening Association in Burlington, VT.. ``What people
are trying to do is replicate the popular `great rooms' in their
houses, but in open air.'' By William L. Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   EAMES-STUDIO (Los Angeles) _ Nearly 50 years ago on a bluff in
Pacific Palisades overlooking the Pacific, Charles and Ray Eames
assembled their house and companion studio from prefabricated parts
ordered off the shelf. The steel structure, prominently featured in
an Eames exhibition that recently opened at the Library of
Congress, was hailed as the prototype for an industrially produced
house that could yield a humane environment at minimal cost. Today,
the light-filled buildings still stand at the side of a meadow of
rye _ quintessential machines in the garden, built to show how
industrialization could economically elevate living standards for
everyone. The buildings embodied democracy. By Joseph Giovannini.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   NY-TKTS-BOOTH (New York) _ To Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, the
TKTS booth that ornaments Times Square like an oversize
red-and-white box kite is one of the ``symbols of the renaissance''
of New York City. To Ron Silver, the actor and chairman of the
official NYC 2000 millennium committee, the booth is ``Times
Square's centerpiece.'' To John F. Breglio, chairman of the Theater
Development Fund, which built and operates the booth, it is a
``symbol of Broadway theater to an entire generation'' and
``perhaps one of the country's most successful graphic designs.''
You would think they were about to nominate the innovative
26-year-old, pipe-and-canvas structure for landmark designation.
But with these words of praise they buried it. The officials
announced a competition for architects, landscape architects and
graphic designers to design a new TKTS booth, which would open next
year. By David W. Dunlap.
</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Garden questions answered. By Leslie Land
</P>
<P>
   URBAN-GARDENS (New York) _ In a city like New York, every square
foot of open space is a treasured commodity, and nobody appreciates
that fact more than urban gardeners. As a breed, they're a hardy
lot, highly adaptable and ready to overcome all obstacles; in these
respects, they're not so different from the gardens they create.
And create them they do: in window boxes, on terraces, in
brownstone yards no bigger than a hankie and on rooftops _
especially on rooftops. By Martha Baker.
</P>
<P>
   HOMMA-GARDEN (New York) _ Robert Homma is surrounded by still
lifes. On the rooftop garden of his apartment near Lincoln Center,
there are patches of velvety moss, each in its own hand-thrown
ceramic pot. There are triptychs of 45-year-old bonsai _ juniper,
maple and elm. Heart-shaped rocks, some pale gray, others dark like
granite, nestle on another bed of moss. By Elaine Louie.

   HOME-IMPROVEMENT (Undated) _ The Home Improvement column. By
Edward Lipinski.

   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ The carnage in Kosovo was the first story
I have covered that was bigger than it looked on television.
</P>
<P>
   The casualties in 1992's Hurricane Andrew were limited and life
continued in many parts of Miami. Last December's bombing of Iraq
provided good televised fireworks, but most Iraqis were barely
inconvenienced.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo was a story of blind ethnic hatred -- the poison that
germinates with simple bigotry and transforms so easily into
bloodshed. Its ravages are not confinable to a television screen.
</P>
<P>
   The acts of evil were too numerous for a journalist to report
and too vast to escape.
</P>
<P>
   There were body parts and weeping mothers that never made it
into my stories. Our hotel meeting place stood above a basement
strewn with the eerie debris of Serb paramilitary gangs. Nights
were punctuated by bursts of gunfire and the barking of stray dogs,
once pets, now traveling in wild packs.
</P>
<P>
   The battle lines were vague; the borders unmarked and innocent
mistakes could be terrifying. But, reality did not hit me until I
foolishly tried to take a day off.
</P>
<P>
   I rode with a fellow journalist to pick up a car her company was
sending from Belgrade. The rendezvous point got switched and we got
lost.
</P>
<P>
   We strayed across the unmarked border and wandered about 4 miles
out of NATO-controlled Kosovo into Serb-controlled Yugoslavia,
where we were held at a Serb police checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
   It was their right to stop us. We were in Serbia -- Yugoslavia's
dominant republic, and of which Kosovo is a province -- without
Yugoslav visas. But things got complicated.
</P>
<P>
   A non-uniformed Serb, drinking beer in the shade, blew up at the
site of our two Kosovar Albanian drivers. He threatened to slit my
friend's throat, then drew a pistol from a holster and threatened
to shoot. His police friends half-heartedly persuaded him to calm
down and told us to sit in the car.
</P>
<P>
   There, I fearfully and surreptitiously ate the press card issued
to me by the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, the Serbs' hated enemy.
</P>
<P>
   We were luckier than I expected. After a trip to a police
station, we were released.
</P>
<P>
   My story is trivial in contrast to the deaths of thousands of
ethnic Albanians here. But, it taught me that there could be no
respite from Kosovo's hatred and horrors.
</P>
<P>
   So overwhelming was the nightmare that it's hard for me to
imagine that people can go on living here.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters lamented the incredible sights we left out of stories.
What about the house where Serbs used their victims blood to write
anti-NATO graffiti on the white walls? How about the dismembered
foot by the road? It was all pushed out by other items more gory or
urgent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the echoes of war prolonged the danger.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees and journalists alike had to watch for trip wires and
land mines. Inspecting charred corpses in one burned house, we
carefully avoided a metal disk spotted beneath rubble on the floor.
To my astonishment, an Australian cameraman then backed up right on
top of it. It wasn't a mine.
</P>
<P>
   One night, I found the NATO troops that I had followed into
Kosovo on June 13 removing machine guns and detonators from the
apartment across the hall. They belonged to a couple whose sons had
been Serb paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the man there threatened some Kosovar Albanians
and they split his head open. A trail of blood lead from our
hallway, down 180 steps and into a plaza nearby.
</P>
<P>
   I moved out, but blood was commonplace. In the Grand Hotel, a
dilapidated Serb-run tower that smells of urine and was home for
much of the press, blood trailed inexplicably down the marble steps
to the basement.
</P>
<P>
   The basement, including a small bowling alley, disco and
conference rooms, was used as a barracks by Serb soldiers. A friend
and I searched it and our little Maglites spotlighted their creepy
artifacts -- clothes, boots, alcohol bottles and syringes, which
were purportedly used for the amphetamines that helped the Serbs
manage their vast murderous workload.
</P>
<P>
   Above ground, almost every ethnic Albanian I met had loved ones
killed or missing. People cried unexpectedly. Death and loss became
the vehicles for bonding.
</P>
<P>
   In our spare time, Fanton, my ethnic Albanian driver, took me to
a mass grave he had discovered.
</P>
<P>
   There were four patches of loose dirt in a hilltop graveyard.
Maybe, I said and wished, they were just paupers' graves.
</P>
<P>
   When he showed me what he said was the back of a skull
protruding from the ground, I suggested it was a rock. We tapped it
with sticks. It sounded too solid for bone.
</P>
<P>
   But, we stripped away a little soil and the stench of human
decay, now familiar to me, rose from the grave. Hair still clung to
a strip of dried skin.
</P>
<P>
   Under Muslim custom, no one would be buried face down, without a
shroud and just inches from the surface. This was a murder victim.
This was a man or woman whose relatives now missed someone --if
they themselves had survived.
</P>
<P>
   Just as it was foolish of me to ever hope for a day off in
Kosovo, I had foolish to think this object in the dirt could have
been anything but a skull. It was another tragedy, lost and
anonymous among the thousands of tragedies in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   (Cox Newspapers Middle East correspondent Larry Kaplow recently
returned from reporting in Kosovo and the Balkans for nearly a
month.)

   So overwhelming was the nightmare that it's hard for me to
imagine that people can go on living here.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters lamented the incredible sights we left out of stories.
What about the house where Serbs used their victims blood to write
anti-NATO graffiti on the white walls? How about the dismembered
foot by the road? It was all pushed out by other items more gory or
urgent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the echoes of war prolonged the danger.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees and journalists alike had to watch for trip wires and
land mines. Inspecting charred corpses in one burned house, we
carefully avoided a metal disk spotted beneath rubble on the floor.
To my astonishment, an Australian cameraman then backed up right on
top of it. It wasn't a mine.
</P>
<P>
   One night, I found the NATO troops that I had followed into
Kosovo on June 13 removing machine guns and detonators from the
apartment across the hall. They belonged to a couple whose sons had
been Serb paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the man there threatened some Kosovar Albanians
and they split his head open. A trail of blood lead from our
hallway, down 180 steps and into a plaza nearby.
</P>
<P>
   I moved out, but blood was commonplace. In the Grand Hotel, a
dilapidated Serb-run tower that smells of urine and was home for
much of the press, blood trailed inexplicably down the marble steps
to the basement.
</P>
<P>
   The basement, including a small bowling alley, disco and
conference rooms, was used as a barracks by Serb soldiers. A friend
and I searched it and our little Maglites spotlighted their creepy
artifacts -- clothes, boots, alcohol bottles and syringes, which
were purportedly used for the amphetamines that helped the Serbs
manage their vast murderous workload.
</P>
<P>
   Above ground, almost every ethnic Albanian I met had loved ones
killed or missing. People cried unexpectedly. Death and loss became
the vehicles for bonding.
</P>
<P>
   In our spare time, Fanton, my ethnic Albanian driver, took me to
a mass grave he had discovered.
</P>
<P>
   There were four patches of loose dirt in a hilltop graveyard.
Maybe, I said and wished, they were just paupers' graves.
</P>
<P>
   When he showed me what he said was the back of a skull
protruding from the ground, I suggested it was a rock. We tapped it
with sticks. It sounded too solid for bone.
</P>
<P>
   But, we stripped away a little soil and the stench of human
decay, now familiar to me, rose from the grave. Hair still clung to
a strip of dried skin.
</P>
<P>
   Under Muslim custom, no one would be buried face down, without a
shroud and just inches from the surface. This was a murder victim.
This was a man or woman whose relatives now missed someone --if
they themselves had survived.
</P>
<P>
   Just as it was foolish of me to ever hope for a day off in
Kosovo, I had foolish to think this object in the dirt could have
been anything but a skull. It was another tragedy, lost and
anonymous among the thousands of tragedies in Kosovo.
</P>

returned from reporting in Kosovo and the Balkans for nearly a

FEW SPEED BUMPS FOR REAGAN LICENSE PLATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ California gave the nation a car culture
and Ronald Reagan, and now the two are destined to become one on
the back of automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   A drive to put a picture of Ronald Reagan on a special
California license plate is speeding through the
Democratic-controlled Legislature with only muted complaints.
</P>
<P>
   About 7,000 people already have signed up to pay $50 for the new
Reagan plates, which would carry a portrait of the former president
and support the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.
</P>
<P>
   With a boost from Nancy Reagan, who recently phoned a Senate
Republican leader to lobby for the bill, the state Senate
Transportation Committee approved the plates Tuesday. The state
Assembly approved the bill earlier.
</P>
<P>
   About four years ago, the Senate committee agreed to stop
approving new specialty license plates because the state was making
so many different varieties the California Highway Patrol started
complaining.
</P>
<P>
   However, as it did recently with AIDS and breast-cancer research
plates, the committee relented again _ on Nancy Reagan's birthday,
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The least we can do in California, which is Reagan country, is
have a license plate in his honor,'' said Assemblyman Tony
Strickland, a Republican from Thousand Oaks, who is the author of
the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of Democrats voted against the measure when it
passed the Assembly. Their public explanation is a steady
proliferation of special license plates compounded by a large
number of high-profile things bearing Reagan's name, including the
Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington and a huge federal
office building there.
</P>
<P>
   The Highway Patrol, which is worried that the large number of
specialty plates will make quick identification of tags more
difficult, did not oppose Strickland's bill.
</P>
<P>
   Seven bills are now in the California Legislature to create new
license plates featuring organizations such as the Boy and Girl
Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous,'' Assemblyman Dick Floyd, a Democrat from
Wilmington, said of the Reagan plate. ``If this goes, then (former
Gov. George) Deukmejian is next, and then they'll go for (ex-Gov.
Pete) Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd ask for one for (former Govs.) Pat Brown and Earl Warren,
but their people would never be so gross as to ask for that.''
</P>
<P>
   The most popular environmental plate raises money to help
restore the Yosemite National Park. About 46,000 Yosemite plates
have been sold, garnering about $9 million. The second most popular
has raised about $3.8 million for arts programs.

   CIR-COMPUTER-COLUMN (Undated) _ The weekly computer column:
swept up in the phenomenal rush of the global Internet that it

gained popular acceptance in the 1980s for its ability to perform a
wide variety of business and scientific tasks, is increasingly
being recognized in the late 1990s as primarily a communications
device that enables anyone to send and receive electronic mail,
participate in discussion groups and browse for information on the

OFFICIAL SEEKS PROBE OF MORMONS FOR POLITICAL ACTIVISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RACHEL GORDON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A San Francisco supervisor has asked the city
attorney and the state attorney general to determine whether it is
illegal for the Mormon Church to support an upcoming ballot
initiative that would ban gay marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Mark Leno made the request after the church recently
issued a ``Dear Brethren and Sisters'' letter asking members to
help assure passage of the March 2000 ballot measure.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was sent to church leaders in California who were
instructed to read it to their members, estimated to be 740,000
statewide.
</P>
<P>
   ``This traditional marriage initiative provides a clear and
significant moral choice,'' said the letter, which was written to
church presidents in charge of California and endorsed by Gordon B.
Hinkley, head of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
``The church's position on this issue is unequivocal.''
</P>
<P>
   Leno believes the action blurs the constitutional line
separating church and state and should prompt the loss of the
tax-exempt status afforded to religious organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe this is a gross abuse of their tax-exempt status,
and would like the city attorney and the state attorney general to
look into the legality of their actions, and, if appropriate, for
the IRS to consider revoking their tax-exempt status,'' Leno said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Leno said the Mormon Church should be accorded the same
treatment by the Internal Revenue Service as the Christian
Coalition, a conservative organization founded by televangelist Pat
Robertson. Last month, the IRS lifted the Christian Coalition's
tax-exempt status after ruling that it was political at its core.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mormon Church, among other Christian denominations, which
receive tax-exempt status, are essentially bankrolling political
support against the gay rights movement by urging their membership
to fight against pro-gay legislation,'' Leno said. ``If churches
want to get involved in politics, they should be held to the same
rules other organizations doing similar political work must
follow.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure on the ballot, formally known as the Definition of
Marriage Initiative, would define marriage as between a man and
woman only, and is intended to block any attempts to sanction gay
marriage. State Sen. Pete Knight, a Republican from Palmdale,
sponsored it.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Callister, a spokesman for the Mormon Church in
California, declined to address Leno's concerns, or the church's
tax-exempt status. He was clear, however, on why his church is
supporting the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``We firmly believe that this is a moral issue,'' he said. ``The
church in California is simply adding its voice to a broad-based
coalition of many who feel strongly about preserving the
traditional family.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mormons proved generous in Alaska and Hawaii on measures
similar to the Knight initiative, pumping $1.1 million into those
successful efforts.

Brandi Chastain has appeared in Gear magazine, crouched behind a

AUTHOR, POET MARK O'BRIEN DIES AT 49 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KATHLEEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ Mark O'Brien, a writer whose determination to
work and live independently from an iron lung was captured in an
Academy Award-winning documentary, died at his home Sunday of
complications of bronchitis. He was 49.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien was the subject of the film ``Breathing Lessons: The
Life and Work of Mark O'Brien,'' which won an Oscar in 1997. The
film described O'Brien's long struggle to escape hospitalization
and his often comic determination to live on his own and work as a
writer.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1990s, his failing health restricted him to the iron
lung for all but a few hours a week.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien, who was born in Boston and grew up in Sacramento,
contracted polio when he was 6 years old. The disease shriveled his
lungs and paralyzed his limbs. Doctors placed him in an iron lung
so he could breathe.
</P>
<P>
   At first, he used it all the time. Then, after a year, he became
strong enough to use it only at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``This allowed me to grow up _ to leave home and earn a B.A. at
the University of California,'' O'Brien wrote in an essay published
in the San Francisco Examiner in 1998. ``But halfway through
graduate school, I was boomeranged by post-polio syndrome. Weaker
than ever, I was forced to spend my days and nights in the iron
lung, forced to quit school.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien, who enrolled at the University of California at
Berkeley in 1978, became a familiar figure on Berkeley's streets as
he navigated his motorized gurney between the campus and his
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   He received a bachelor of arts degree in English literature in
1982, with help from note takers, home health care workers and the
staff of the Center for Independent Living, a Berkeley advocacy
group for people with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   He began his career as a writer in 1979, when Co-Evolution
Quarterly published his essay on independent living.
</P>
<P>
   The essay caught the attention of Sandy Close, executive editor
of the Pacific News Service in San Francisco, who hired him.
</P>
<P>
   As a correspondent, O'Brien wrote about sports, religion, his
life-changing session with a sex therapist, Steven Hawkings, and
the culture and politics of being disabled.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, he wrote stories by dictating,'' Close said. ``Then
he wrote by manipulating a stick with his mouth to press the keys,
first of an IBM Selectric and then a word processor, as he laid in
the iron lung with his neck stuck outside. He would lay his cheek
on the platform that stuck out from the machine.''
</P>
<P>
   She said O'Brien ``had a remarkable way of accepting every good
thing that came his way, with delight.''
</P>
<P>
   Close, who produced the documentary film on O'Brien with money
from a MacArthur Foundation grant, said his twin passions were
baseball _ in particular, the San Francisco Giants _ and
Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, O'Brien alluded to the strength his Catholic faith
had given him: ``Disability causes me to believe more strongly in a
duality between body and spirit ... 'cause if I'm a soul, I'm just
as good as you. And if I'm a body, then I'm up s--- creek, ain't
I?''
</P>
<P>
   In the title poem from ``Breathing,'' a collection of his poems
published by Little Dog Press in 1990, O'Brien wrote about air,
breathing and the machine that kept him alive: ``All I get is a
thin stream of it/A finger's width of the rope that ties me to
life/As I labor like a stevedore to keep the connection.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, O'Brien co-founded Lemonade Factory, a small press in
Berkeley that specializes in publishing poetry written by people
with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Lemonade Press has published two volumes of O'Brien's poetry:
``The Man in the Iron Lung'' in 1997, and ``Love and Baseball'' in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien is survived by his father Walter, brother Ken, sister
Rachel Jordan of Colfax; and long-time attendant Bruce Ward.

   OUTDOOR-DESIGN (Undated) _ The craze for picture windows and

renaissance of the '80s that became the boom in casual outdoor
living in the early 1990s has found its endgame _ outdoor interior
decoration. ``It's gone from furnishing the outdoors to decorating

   EAMES-STUDIO (Los Angeles) _ Nearly 50 years ago on a bluff in
Pacific Palisades overlooking the Pacific, Charles and Ray Eames
assembled their house and companion studio from prefabricated parts
ordered off the shelf. The steel structure, prominently featured in
an Eames exhibition that recently opened at the Library of
Congress, was hailed as the prototype for an industrially produced
house that could yield a humane environment at minimal cost. Today,
the light-filled buildings still stand at the side of a meadow of
rye _ quintessential machines in the garden, built to show how
industrialization could economically elevate living standards for
everyone. The buildings embodied democracy. By Joseph Giovannini.

   NY-TKTS-BOOTH (New York) _ To Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, the
TKTS booth that ornaments Times Square like an oversize
red-and-white box kite is one of the ``symbols of the renaissance''
of New York City. To Ron Silver, the actor and chairman of the
official NYC 2000 millennium committee, the booth is ``Times
Square's centerpiece.'' To John F. Breglio, chairman of the Theater
Development Fund, which built and operates the booth, it is a
``symbol of Broadway theater to an entire generation'' and
``perhaps one of the country's most successful graphic designs.''
You would think they were about to nominate the innovative
26-year-old, pipe-and-canvas structure for landmark designation.
But with these words of praise they buried it. The officials
announced a competition for architects, landscape architects and
graphic designers to design a new TKTS booth, which would open next

CLINTON: HOW LAME A DUCK? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 11)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The great unsolved mystery in the nation's capital
this summer centers around a lame-duck president's determination to
soar across the land like a conquering eagle.
</P>
<P>
   With only 18 months left in his eight-year presidency, Bill
Clinton refuses to accept lame-duck status. He is racing about the
nation as though he were just beginning his tenure rather than
limping toward the end of it.
</P>
<P>
   Since much of Clinton's moral leadership was squandered by the
Monica Lewinsky revelations and congressional impeachment efforts,
he has a lot of catching up to do. He wants to improve his legacy
by the time he leaves office _ if he can.
</P>
<P>
   By tradition, the president, banned by the 22nd Amendment from
seeking a third term and with few major legislative battles to
fight, should be slowing down in preparation for a quiet transfer
of power to his successor on Jan. 20, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton, at 52, is much younger and more vigorous than most
of his predecessors at their time of retirement. He also is
addicted to action and driven by ambition and a desire to be
remembered well by future generations.
</P>
<P>
   There is no chance that he will be ranked with such illustrious
Democrats as Franklin D. Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson or Harry Truman,
but he could end up ahead of Jimmy Carter and possibly in a
category with his idol, John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   While the Lewinsky scandal proved destructive, he apparently
believes that his presidency can be resurrected with far-reaching
legislative achievements.
</P>
<P>
   With the economy growing at 4.3 percent in the first three
months of 1999, the budget surplus expected to reach $99 billion
this year and $3 trillion over the next 15 years and the war in
Kosovo won, the president sees this as a ``time of great hope'' and
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent news conference, he explained the force that drives
him: ``We will be judged by what we do with this opportunity _
whether we seize it or squander it in petty bickering and partisan
animosity.'' He doesn't want history to record that in his last
months as president, he turned his back on the chance to achieve
vital goals for America.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, he has unveiled a plan to improve Medicare with,
among other proposals, financial help for prescription drugs. The
Clinton plan has generated an angry political battle on Capitol
Hill, where the Republicans control both houses and the two parties
are gathering ammunition for the 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   But prescription drug payments should prove popular with senior
citizens, who vote in large numbers.
</P>
<P>
   An equally volatile fight should develop over distribution of
the budget surplus. Clinton lists saving Social Security and
Medicare as his top priority. Republicans favor a tax cut which,
like Clinton's prescription drug proposal, should prove popular
with voters.
</P>
<P>
   In a journey reminiscent of Lyndon Johnson's 1964 trip through
the valleys and villages of Appalachia to explain and dramatize his
anti-poverty initiatives, Clinton last week led a group of
corporate, civic and political leaders on a tour of ``the places in
our country which have not yet felt the surge of our economy.''
Those places, described by the president as ``America's new
markets,'' are poverty-stricken neighborhoods where tax credits and
loan guarantees presumably could provide jobs and growth.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will also battle for congressional approval of stronger
gun control and of a patients' bill of rights, which would regulate
the managed-care industry and have a strong impact on people who
are members of health maintenance organizations (HMOs).
</P>
<P>
   In this century, only Theodore Roosevelt, who left the
presidency at age 50, was younger at retirement than Clinton will
be. But TR's need to lead and bask in public adulation, plus his
restlessness with retirement, led him into an ill-fated and
fruitless attempt in 1912 to wrest the GOP nomination from his
hand-chosen successor, William Howard Taft.
</P>
<P>
   His bold quest for a return to power ended with his unsuccessful
bid for the presidency on the Progressive Party ticket. As it
turned out, he split the Republican Party and assured the election
of Democrat Woodrow Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Had Kennedy lived to be reelected in 1964 and retire in 1968, he
would have been 51 and presumably would have had many years of
public service ahead of him. The oldest retiree from the White
House was Ronald Reagan, who celebrated his 78th birthday two weeks
after leaving office.
</P>
<P>
   Although Reagan had some worthwhile legislative achievements
during his last two years in office, his record was tarnished by
the Iran-contra affair in which the United States secretly sold
arms to Iran and used the money to fund the Contra rebels in
Nicaragua. The affair, part of which Reagan denied knowing about,
raised questions about his credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is fortunate to have survived a scandal far more
debilitating than Reagan's and, to some degree, put it behind him
before entering the final stretch of his presidency. Although by
political definition he is a lame duck, he is not ready to accept
that designation or indulge in traditional lame-duck behavior.

<P>
   She was about 11 years old and breathlessly excited, surrounded
by three girlfriends and chattering into a cellular phone.
``Britney was awesome!'' she gasped, jumping up and down. ``She was
hot!'' The girl was in the lobby of the Continental Airlines Arena
in East Rutherford, N.J., between acts at Zootopia '99, a
radio-station charity concert with a bill featuring cute boys (98
Degrees, Sugar Ray, Jordan Knight, Joe McIntyre) and a perky girl
(Britney Spears) singing about love, love, love. Britney's fan was
probably talking to another girlfriend. But at that moment, she
could have been giving dictation to the American pop marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   This season belongs to the kiddie-pop brigades. Applause is
passe; the reaction most eagerly sought by pop culture right now,
from music to television to movies, is a high-pitched squeal from a
mob of young girls. When it's directed at males, that squeal
signifies romantic fantasy while it tests out some newly active
hormonal responses. Directed at females, it's a squeal of sisterly
solidarity and fashion approval. And for the last few years, its
volume has been steadily rising until it threatens to drown out
anything with more mature audiences in mind. Kiddie-pop has always
been available to those who wanted it, but in the late 1990s, it's
turning into the only game in town.
</P>
<P>
   The mass market has been voting with its dollars for
kiddie-friendly hits with pinup potential. The Backstreet Boys'
``Millennium,'' Ricky Martin's ``Ricky Martin'' and Britney Spears'
`` ... Baby One More Time'' have been lodged in the Top 10; 'N
Sync, 98 Degrees and BWitched are million-sellers and Top 40
fixtures. At the movies, a tow-headed tyke saves the day in the new
``Star Wars'' product, which has been purged of both blood and
sexual banter that might confuse the elementary-school crowd. And
new television series are running out of teen-age actors to hire as
they jockey to become the next ``Dawson's Creek.''
</P>
<P>
   A censorious furor over comic books and rock-and-roll began in
the 1950s, and since then there have been people and groups who
want to police all the arts to a level considered safe for
children. After the high-school shootings in Colorado, Congress
debated making it a federal crime to expose a child to depictions
of explicit sex or violence. There's still plenty of nasty stuff
around, and plenty of troubled and disquieting messages from
artists and hustlers. But now, without coercion, calculations are
being made across the entertainment business that the pre-teen
audience is the key to blockbuster success.
</P>
<P>
   It could be a symptom of mass regression. Grown-ups are
slouching around in sweatsuits that are the closest thing to infant
rompers, flocking to movies full of juvenile potty humor and
listening to kiddie-pop. Meanwhile, Times Square has been handed
over to cartoon characters. (It's all too perfect that the
Backstreet Boys, 'N Sync and a stable of fellow kiddie-pop hopefuls
are based in Orlando, Fla., just like Disney World.) Youth culture
once meant culture stoked by the energy and confusion and idealism
of adolescence; now, it seems, listeners prefer to be babied.
</P>
<P>
   According to United States census figures, the number of people
aged 5 to 13 _ the core of the kiddie-pop audience _ has grown by
about 3.5 million since 1990, slightly over 1 percent of the total
population. But children's influence has grown faster than their
numbers. The entertainment business has clearly decided that
youngsters now have decisive buying power.
</P>
<P>
   Kiddie pop music benefits from a handful of interlocking trends.
There's a general return _ post-grunge, post-gangsta _ to peppy,
happy-faced pop songs: a reaction to too much self-importantly
gloomy music. (Perhaps, after a long national sex scandal, people
are also longing for more romantic, less carnal visions of love.)
There's a creative slump in rock's more aggressive styles; maybe
musicians are hoarding brilliant ideas until 2000, so they won't
get lumped in with that old 20th-century music. There's also an
all-out assault on the language barrier by comely Hispanic pop
stars (with Ricky Martin and Jennifer Lopez in the vanguard) who
polished their pickup lines and video moves before Spanish-speaking
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there's a post-Hanson, post-Brandy, post-LeAnn Rimes
rush by recording companies to sign precocious talent: the
13-year-old classical soprano Charlotte Church, the 19-year-old
Lilith Fair contender Kendall Payne, the teen-age rhythm-and-blues
trio Blaque and the Moffatts, a four-brother group _ like Hanson
plus one _ of 15-year-old triplets and a 16-year-old brother. (Of
course, singers don't have to be teen-agers to draw squeals;
geezers in their early '20s are fine, as long as there's no show of
crudeness, chest hair, crooked teeth or condescension.) All those
tendencies converge to anoint 11-year-old girls as pop's reigning
tastemakers.
</P>
<P>
   Adults, not just little girls, are paying attention. The
Backstreet Boys, for instance, have been getting top airplay on
adult-contemporary (or ``lite'') radio stations whose presumed
audience is well over 25. For some older listeners, apparently,
kiddie pop's pledges of love stake out the romantic middle of the
road that Bread or Boyz II Men once occupied. And the performers'
youth makes them even more attractive than older saccharin
dispensers. It's easier for youngsters to act innocent, which is a
relief for some adults and a turn-on, acknowledged or not, for
others.

<P>
   While a few teen-age performers, like Aaliyah and Li'l Kim, have
exploited their jailbait allure, kiddie-pop's top acts present the
image of extremely good children: ambitious and diligent and
virtuous. The CD-ROM component of Britney Spears' album, `` ...
Baby One More Time,'' includes a photo scrapbook of her training
and triumphs: dance class, gymnastics trophies, her selection at
age 10 as Miss Talent USA. She's not just a superkid. She's
obedient, too, singing the songs and hitting the marks that are
choreographed for her. So do the boy groups, synchronizing their
moves without a trace of mischief. Pop provides wish-fulfillment
for listeners, and kiddie pop can give adults the ultimate parental
fantasy: well-groomed, perfectly behaved, highly motivated
adolescents who _ fantasy of fantasies _ always do as they're told.
</P>
<P>
   Girlish enthusiasm has stoked the pop market at least since the
days of bobby-soxers swooning over Frank Sinatra. When
rock-and-roll began, many people thought its sole purpose was to
get teen-agers hot and bothered and insisted that it would never be
good for anything else. By the early 1960s, the formula for
teen-age idols was already in place: a nice young man, songs that
promised endless sublimated love, mild-mannered music and an
attitude that wouldn't scare parents. Television exposure _ the
best way for an under-age girl to get a glimpse of the product _
was a catalyst for stars from Ricky Nelson to the Jackson 5.
</P>
<P>
   In rock's early days, a hitmaker was expected to have teen
appeal; the Beatles would have been nowhere without that initial,
deafening wave of Beatlemania. But the Beatles, and rock, decided
to grow up, shrugging off teen-pop antecedents and differentiating
themselves from the unabashed commercialism of knockoffs like the
Monkees. Soon, self-conscious rockers began defining themselves
against the teen-pop recipe. They would be noisy and rebellious;
they wouldn't confine themselves to sweet love songs. They would
try to live up to every parental worry they could imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Teen idols never disappeared, but by the 1970s they had
sacrificed most respect. True rockers considered themselves artists
with careers, not mere entertainers, and it was already obvious
that the teen-idol business had faster turnover than a junior high
school. Adulation for the cute boy singer of the moment was, for
most fans, a phase between teddy bears and actual boyfriends,
something they would later look back on with a blush. And young
girls had no use for their older sisters' fleeting favorites. David
Cassidy, Shaun Cassidy, Andy Gibb and Rick Springfield flickered
across pop's short-term memory and receded, with only the
performers themselves, perhaps, expecting the squeals to go on
forever.
</P>
<P>
   Music video revitalized the teen-idol business in the 1980s.
Television exposure for pop stars was no longer available only at
the whim of a network broadcaster. It was a 24-hour presence, with
video clips displaying performers in perfectly controlled, no-sweat
vignettes. MTV gave little girls access to a whole new galaxy of
perfectly styled, spiffily packaged acts. It galvanized a new
prepubescent market for pop: little girls in the taste gap between
Raffi and Jewel. The unexpected side effect was that it also gave
them a chance to see rockers who weren't aiming for pre-teen
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Performers like Boy George, the Stray Cats and Cyndi Lauper
found they had very young fans; Duran Duran worked overtime to
portray themselves as glamorous jet-setters with deep thoughts, not
just smiling heartthrobs. Madonna may have enjoyed her littlest
wanna-bes for a while; then she sexed up her act, decisively
pulling herself out of the kiddie arena. Even would-be tough guys,
like Vanilla Ice, found themselves rapping to little girls who
couldn't care less whether he was from the 'hood. Rebels, gangstas,
grotesques, highbrows and punks were all available for home
contemplation and consumption; even Kurt Cobain could become a teen
idol, much to his distress.
</P>
<P>
   But this is the era of niche marketing, and fans and parents
would prefer that kiddie pop stay out of the post-pubertal world of
overt lust, anger and ambiguity. Although the boundary between
childish and adult (or at least late-teen) material is fuzzy, music
fans who want to feel mature generally don't want grade-schoolers
tagging along. Outside all-ages hardcore punk shows, the presence
of children suggests that the music is tame and wimpy. The
grade-schoolers, meanwhile, would rather have something all their
own. Categories reassure potential consumers, too. When kiddie pop
is neatly defined, parents can buy designated albums with a clearer
conscience, secure that their daughters won't be corrupted.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked into its sector of the pop market, kiddie pop is the
perfect niche item It's formulaic, mass-produced, marketed in
reliable ways and almost immediately obsolete. ``Watch it fizz and
pop,'' Britney Spears sings. ``The clock is ticking and we can't
stop.'' As a bonus, kiddie pop sells not only itself but all sorts
of merchandise: T-shirts, posters, videos, baseball caps.
(Merchandising is also the true Force behind the characterless new
``Star Wars'' characters.) With the Internet threatening to force
recording companies to lower their prices, merchandise could help
maintain pop profit margins.

 UNDATED: profit margins.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kiddie-pop acts make ideal fodder for the current music
business. They're malleable and ripe for exploitation by the
managers and producers they depend on. And they're stepping into a
business that, with radio stations' help, is doing its best to
recreate 1961: selling singles not albums, pushing one-hit wonders
and tossing as many potential teen idols into the marketplace as it
can find. If a career lasts only a year or two _ well, there's more
in the talent pool.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the prospects for former kiddie stars are better than
they were a decade ago. Alanis Morrissette lived down her past as a
Canadian child star; Ricky Martin did his time in Menudo, the
Puerto Rican boy band. Robbie Williams, formerly of the English boy
band Take That, was a smash in England and has been moderately
successful here. Jordan Knight, a former New Kid on the Block,
recently had a Top 10 single, and Geri Halliwell, who bailed out of
the Spice Girls after two albums, has started to present herself as
an adult. Then again, for comic relief there was Vanilla Ice's
attempted comeback as a thrash-rocker.
</P>
<P>
   In its music, kiddie pop invariably looks back. It's a yardstick
for what pop styles are now considered unthreatening; the music can
be recycled and resold to audiences who never heard its past
incarnations. Leif Garrett remade 1950s hits in the 1970s; New
Edition started out emulating the Jackson 5.
</P>
<P>
   The current surge of kiddie pop can be credited to, or blamed
on, two 1980s hitmakers: the New Kids on the Block and Madonna.
When New Edition got out from under the thumb of their producer and
manager, Maurice Starr, he decided to apply the same tricks to a
white group: the New Kids. It didn't matter that their voices would
never match the Chi-Lites or the Delfonics; the New Kids were
handsome, bland and camera-ready. They danced a little, sang a
little and flirted a lot, and they left their game plan behind for
1990s groups. Johnny Wright, who worked his way up Starr's
management company, supervised the ascent of the Backstreet Boys
(whom he no longer manages) and 'N Sync as well as Britney Spears.
</P>
<P>
   For boy bands, the formula has grown so rigid that only a
10-year-old girl can distinguish 'N Sync from the Backstreet Boys
(both quintets), or 98 Degrees from C-Note from LFO (all quartets).
They need a blond, some brunettes and one moderately swarthy type;
someone, usually the swarthy one, has a little facial hair to
designate him as the group's sensitive rebel. Each guy has a single
identifying attribute _ he's an ex-Mouseketeer or a basketball
player or secretly shy _ that makes the fans feel a little closer.
And the rest is smiles, harmony and promises: ``I Just Wanna Be
With You,'' ``To Me You're Everything,'' ``Don't Wanna Lose You
Now.'' Real boyfriends never seem to be as agreeable.
</P>
<P>
   Female kiddie stars are a newer phenomenon. While little girls
may have identified with Little Peggy March or Brenda Lee, pop
moguls generally assumed that pretty boys would be the main magnet
for allowance money. Then Madonna changed their minds. Female
kiddie pop owes everything to early Madonna; the sauciness, the
bouncy beat, the show of independence coupled with come-ons. Songs
like ``Borderline'' and ``Holiday,'' smoothing out disco with
bell-toned keyboards and chirpy choruses, became templates for
singers who want to cultivate both dance-club disk jockeys and pop
radio exposure. (Boy bands like 'N Sync have listened to Madonna,
too.) The Spice Girls split Madonna's personality five ways, toning
down the toughness and losing the Roman Catholic fixations while
exploiting countless merchandising tie-ins. And now, young hopefuls
like the 16-year-old English singer Billie _ who actually has a
promising voice _ are studying the Spice Girls.
</P>
<P>
   Kiddie-pop albums are formulaic down to the song order. The
first cut is the most aggressive or suggestive one, the closest
counterfeit of adult pop. The trick is to come up with an entendre
so vague that adults can give it a sexual interpretation and
children, theoretically, don't. The Backstreet Boys open
``Millennium'' with ``Larger Than Life,'' a reflection on fame that
flatters their fans as the people whose love can make everything
right; looking at the crowd and watching the bodies swaying, they
add, ``Wish I could thank you in a different way.'' And what,
exactly, is Britney Spears being hit with when she puts on her Pat
Benatar voice to insist, ``Hit me, baby, one more time''?
</P>
<P>
   But after the opening, nearly grown-up song, kiddie-pop albums
grow sappier fast. They have you're-the-one songs and
after-the-breakup songs and self-esteem songs and dreaming-of-you
songs. Most groups also have a pious number praising God, parents
or both, all in the most unctuous harmony.
</P>
<P>
   The hand-me-down music of current kiddie pop presents an
illusion of racial assimilation. Despite their segregated lineups
(with the Spice Girls as an exception), kiddie-pop groups dress,
sing, dance and banter like rhythm-and-blues and hip-hop
performers. Just about every white boy-band stretches its vocal
melismas like George Michael striving to imitate Stevie Wonder. But
instead of pretending that they invented the style, kiddie-pop
bands are self-conscious about the racial pilfering that's as old
as rock-and-roll. At the Zootopia show, 98 Degrees followed some
rhythm-and-blues harmonizing with the Offspring's ``Pretty Fly for
a White Guy,'' simultaneously self-deflating and self-promoting.
</P>
<P>
   Kiddie pop is calculated to a fare-thee-well. Its best craftsmen
_ notably the Swedish songwriter and producer, Max Martin, who's
behind the Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears _ have some fun as
they plunder hooks and gimmicks from Abba, Michael Jackson,
Babyface, Kansas, Phil Collins, Prince, the Cars, the Eagles, Roxy
Music and other hitmakers from the 1960s to the 1990s. They know
that the music's most ardent fans come to the music with no
perception of cliches and no distrust of gooey sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   And for kiddie pop's shadow audience, the adults who are making
the albums linger in the charts long after the first rush of the
grade-school set, the music's appeal is inseparable from its
pre-fab, synthetic essence. It holds nothing new and difficult,
nothing agonizingly sincere or brutally realistic, nothing barbed
or underhanded or unruly or obtuse. At the same time, it doesn't
feel too old-fashioned, not with Britney Spears singing, ``e-mail
My heart.'' Kiddie pop provides a harmless first crush, an easy
transition to adult concerns, which will intrude soon enough in the
lives of its younger fans. The music is an intermission between
crises, and it's less troublesome than genuine rejuvenation could
ever be. Because in kiddie pop, growing pains never arrive.

<P>
   A concrete slab rests on a sand base on the ground. It can be
used as a patio or as an extension to the driveway _ a space to
park your boat, say, or trailer. Because it rests on the ground and
not on footings, it cannot be used as a floor for a building like a
garage.
</P>
<P>
   Creating the slab does not require any special building skills,
but it is hard work. At least two people are required to move the
concrete, pour it, level it, then smooth and rough it. Weather is
an important consideration. Since all the work will be done
outdoors, you must pick a dry day with no rain in the forecast. The
temperature should be between 65 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   Before beginning this project, check with the local building
inspector to see if the codes require a special permit. Also make
sure you know exactly where your property boundary lines are; you
don't want the pad to extend onto your neighbor's land.
</P>
<P>
   For pouring and shaping the concrete, you will need to rent the
following tools: a heavy-duty wheelbarrow, a bull float with
extension handles, a joint tool, an edging tool, a magnesium trowel
for final smoothing and a heavy-duty push broom with stiff
bristles. You will also need a few wood-working tools, a hammer,
saw and a two- or four-foot level, to build the concrete forms.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, don't forget safety gear. Wet concrete may seem like
mild, inert stuff, but it is caustic and can cause skin burns. Wear
long pants and a long- sleeved shirt, high rubber boots and
heavy-duty gloves when pouring and smoothing the concrete.
</P>
<P>
   Begin by selecting the best location for the slab. If you are
making a parking surface for a boat or trailer, then it must be
adjacent to the driveway. With a patio slab, you have more options.
View, traffic flow to the house and kitchen, orientation to the sun
and privacy are all factors. Avoid sites that are often remain
water-soaked after heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
   When you have chosen the location, lay out the perimeter on the
ground. You can do this by driving a series of stakes and running
cord between them, or you can spray a line of bright paint directly
onto the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is preparation of the subgrade, the earth beneath
the slab. This step is important, because a poor subgrade will
allow the concrete slab to settle unevenly, causing cracks or
fissures.
</P>
<P>
   Remove all organic matter, grass, sod and roots, as well as
large stones, from the site. Grade the ground so it is level, then
examine it for soft, mucky or spongy spots. Dig these out and fill
the holes with material similar to the rest of the site or with
granular material like sand, gravel or crushed stone.
</P>
<P>
   Next tamp down the ground to compress the soil, then cover the
site with granular fill. The fill should be at least four to six
inches thick and should extend at least 12 inches beyond the
perimeter of the slab. This extra extension will prevent rainwater
from undercutting the slab during heavy storms.
</P>
<P>
   Dampen the sand or gravel lightly _ there should be no puddles
or freestanding water _ then tamp the surface down. If your slab
site is relatively small, you can use a hand tamper, but for larger
jobs it is best to rent a heavy roller or a power tamper (also
called a vibratory plate compactor) for this operation. Check to
make sure that the subgrade is level. Add extra fill to any low
spots, than tamp again.
</P>
<P>
   At this point you are ready to construct the concrete forms. Use
2 by 4's that are straight, smooth and free of warps to make the
forms. Stand the 2 by 4's on edge and brace them in position with 1
by 3 stakes. Position the stakes so they are a minimum of 36 inches
apart and so the tops are level, or slightly lower than the top of
the forms. Nail the stakes to the 2 by 4's with double- headed
nails (also called duplex or stage nails).
</P>
<P>
   There should not be any gaps between the boards, and the forms
must be sturdy enough to withstand the horizontal pressure of the
poured concrete without bulging. Use a spirit level to the make
sure the forms are level. Oil the inside surfaces of the form
boards (the sides that will touch the concrete) to prevent the
boards from sticking to the hardened concrete.
</P>
<P>
   At this point you are ready to order the concrete, pour it and
surface it to make the slab. This will be covered next week.

 By JOSEPH GIOVANNINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Fifty years ago on a bluff in Pacific Palisades
overlooking the Pacific, Charles and Ray Eames assembled their
house and companion studio from prefabricated parts ordered off the
shelf. The steel structure, prominently featured in an Eames
exhibition that recently opened at the Library of Congress, was
hailed as the prototype for an industrially produced house that
could yield a humane environment at minimal cost.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the light-filled buildings stand at the side of a meadow
of rye _ quintessential machines in the garden, built to show how
industrialization could economically elevate living standards for
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   The house was heroic in its idealism and global in its
implications, but a big terra-cotta pot brimming with marguerites
at the front door hints at another story. Flowers welcome visitors
today _ as they did when the Eameses lived there. Smaller pots with
scented geraniums, lobelias, cyclamens, fuchsias and Mexican
primroses line the front of the house, where the steel sash windows
meet the gravel. The great house, built as a rigorous thesis with
an ambitious social goal, has a soul.
</P>
<P>
   The potted flowers surrounding the house were largely Ray's
domain; she was ``the esthetic conscience'' of the office of
Charles and Ray Eames, said their former associate Deborah Sussman,
the Los Angeles graphic designer. ``Ray sensed intuitively when art
was present and when it wasn't, and that sense played a huge role
in the Eames world,'' she added. ``Everybody else, including
Charles, knew she knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Charles got the lion's share of the credit for the
creative work of the office, it was Ray, working with Charles out
of a bathroom laboratory, who shaped the bewitching pretzels of
plywood _ free-form sculpture molded in compound curves _ that
would lend lilt to their Eames chair. (She died in 1988, 10 years
to the day after her husband.)
</P>
<P>
   Trained as a painter with Hans Hofmann in New York, she had
perfect pitch for color. Like nature, Ray abhorred a vacuum. Over
the years, the clean-lined house on Chautauqua Boulevard acquired
constellations of small things. A miniaturist, she gardened the
interior with spoons, combs, vases and textiles. On her patios, she
cultivated botanical humility, eschewing show-stoppers like orchids
and lilies. She liked the intense orange-red-to-hot-red geranium
flower's relationship to its green leaf. When she plucked dead
leaves, she bowed straight from the waist, looking a little like a
flower, herself. Her eye delighted in a detail like the square cut
of a petal.
</P>
<P>
   On a three-and-a-half-acre lot designed to look untamed, Ray
planted the color. Her garden was pointillistic, composed of
hundreds of dots that added up to the color fields of a painter who
preferred a small canvas. Over the years, with more and more pots,
the patios filled in. What began as a spare carpet of space at the
foot of the house and studio reached what Eames Demetrios, the
Eameses' grandson, calls an ecological ``climax community.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a collection that Tina Beebe, who worked beside Ray for
years as a graphic artist, said ``always harbored little surprises
_ fraises des bois, Oxalis oregona.'' Ms. Beebe, a colorist
associated with Moore Ruble Yudell, an architectural firm in Santa
Monica, has cultivated a garden of Ray's favorites in Malibu, in
remembrance of a woman who would appear at lunches with nosegays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray taught me to love roses _ she gave me my first Belle of
Portugal,'' Ms. Beebe said. ``Ray liked flowers with little white
faces, and singles rather than doubles. She didn't avoid a flower
like tweedia because it was hard to grow. Her garden required a lot
of work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She always traveled with scissors,'' Ms. Beebe continued.
``Ray had an understanding with her neighbor, Mrs. Bailey: any
roses over the fence were fair game.'' She distributed them during
the rest of her day.
</P>
<P>
   She was a modernist with a subversive, almost Victorian,
sensibility. ``She'd give you these tiny, tiny little things
carefully wrapped in wet cotton and wax paper,'' Ms. Sussman said.
``Always this tiny little collage that was beautiful and exquisite,
and meaningful to her and therefore to you. There would be
forget-me-nots. Who has them now? The bouquets were never rigid:
she worked them like a painter, pushing and pulling. Her
understanding was in her cells.''
</P>
<P>
   She arranged the flowers on her tables at home and in the office
in a perfect relationship. ``She had as much depth and intensity of
appreciation for that little petal, the ruffly petal of a rose, as
she did for any designed object,'' said Elaine Sewell Jones, a
fellow at the American Institute of Architecture and a close
friend. ``She loved scented flowers, and whenever we traveled, she
almost always had a bouquet of gardenias or a clutch of lemon
verbena. She often wore a Cecile Bruner rose, with that teeny, tiny
bud.''
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Neuhart, who contributed to ``Eames Design: The Work of
the Office of Charles and Ray Eames'' (Abrams, 1989) with her
husband, John Neuhart, and Ray Eames, recalled her work habits.
``The first thing Ray did after breakfast was to gather anything in
bloom, and bring the flowers down to the office in a basket, along
with lunch, and arrange them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Neuhart added: ``The really wild thing was they used to go out
to the west side of the office and picnic on a vacant lot. Charles
and Ray would spread their blanket in all these weeds and debris,
and she'd have a little thing of flowers, and she'd pull up her
dress to sun her legs, and he'd take off his shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Eames recorded the world around him through his camera.
In their film about the house, ``House: After Five Years of
Living'' (1955), flowers fill the house like oxygen. The
photographs _ there are 750,000 Eames stills at the Library of
Congress _ constitute an implicit record of Ray's ecosystem of
flowers approaching their climax state.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers infiltrated the office's projects, too. Ms. Sussman
opened a deck of the Eameses' building cards and discovered one of
Ray's nosegays pictured _ daisies with a bit of a geranium, some
violets and a little begonia _ ``insignificant little things made
art,'' Ms. Sussman said.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's nosegays found their way onto the stock certificates of
Herman Miller, the company that first produced Eames furniture.
Flowers started appearing at Eames exhibitions. ``She bought potted
Easter lilies, and spread them at the base of the panels in the old
IBM galleries on Madison Avenue in New York,'' Neuhart said. ``It
took a certain curse off a temporary exhibition; it relieved the
hard edges.''
</P>
<P>
   Bouquets found their humanistic way into their multiscreen film
``Glimpses of the U.S.A.'' (1959), shown in the Soviet Union at the
exhibition made famous by the Nixon-Khrushchev kitchen debate. ``In
the `U.S.A.' film, they didn't know how to end it,'' said their
grandson. ``Ray suggested an image of forget-me-nots, and they both
knew it was right. And by one of those cosmic flukes, the flowers
had the same name with the same meaning in Russian. So at the end
of the film, the seven images merged into one picture of a bouquet
of forget-me-nots, and everyone in Moscow choked up.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sussman noted: ``She made you see things differently by the
way she put things together. Charles would sometimes conceptualize
about whether a color should be bright or subdued, but he was
conservative about color. It was one of her contributions to their
work.''

   Port of Choice: Easy USB's
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a new Pentium III PC and a printer that can work with
USB or parallel connections. Which should I use to hook up the
printer?
</P>
<P>
   A. The choice between the USB and parallel ports for your
printer's connection might depend on how comfortable you are with
installing hardware. The USB, or Universal Serial Bus, route is
considered by many to be easier than configuring the parallel port.
Windows 98 will automatically recognize that you have attached a
new USB device and lead you through the installation process.
</P>
<P>
   Another benefit of USB is that its data transfer speed is
usually a bit faster than that of a standard parallel port. And by
using the USB connection, you free up your parallel port for some
other device.
</P>
<P>
   USB is designed to eliminate the need for juggling extra PC
cards, settings and switches when adding devices. With the proper
configuration, it is possible to link up to 127 USB devices to one
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Early versions of Windows 95 don't offer USB functions, so you
may have to download a patch from Microsoft. Apple Computer's iMac
and its newer G3 models handle USB connections. You can find out
more at www.usb.org.

NEW YORK ROOFTOP GARDENING: FEATHERING THE NEST OUTDOORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: 2 optional sidebars in 2nd take)  
 (bl)  
 By MARTHA BAKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a city like this, every square foot of open space
is a treasured commodity, and nobody appreciates that fact more
than urban gardeners. As a breed, they're a hardy lot, highly
adaptable and ready to overcome all obstacles; in these respects,
they're not so different from the gardens they create. And create
them they do: in window boxes, on terraces, in brownstone yards no
bigger than a hankie and on rooftops _ especially on rooftops (as
any aerial view of New York City will bear out).
</P>
<P>
   The challenges facing a rooftop gardener here are legion.
Daylong exposure to brutal sunlight, unfettered winds, air
pollution, shallow soil, not to mention the city ordinances
regarding weight allowances, water strictures and a myriad of other
safety factors _ it's enough to make most gardeners throw in the
trowel. But the prodigious effort is well worth the reward _ a
garden with panoramic views like few others in the world.
</P>
<P>
   When a garden sprouts from a rooftop, it acts as a forecourt to
everything around it, so that the view becomes a part of the garden
itself. (The Chinese call the concept ``borrowing the landscape.'')
One particularly fine example of the phenomenon is the rooftop
garden of Tim and Dagny Du Val, who design and install urban
gardens through their company, Plant Specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, when the company was forced to move from its
Manhattan location, the Du Vals' search for a new space led them to
Long Island City, Queens. There they found the ideal site: a
mid-19th-century metal foundry housed in a complex of two-story
brick buildings covering an entire city block.
</P>
<P>
   With more than enough space for their needs, the couple reserved
a portion of it (along with the foundry's original cobblestone
courtyard) for themselves and their company, then converted the
rest into small business spaces and European-style ateliers for
artists. Today, a Starbucks commissary, Authentico, which caters
Mexican food, and a Turkish bakery coexist with Edwina von Gal, a
landscape architect, and Tom Penn, a sculptor and the son of
photographer Irving Penn.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the Du Vals' roof garden remained an on-and-off-again
affair. ``It started out as an orphanage,'' Ms. Du Val explained,
``a place for salvaging castoff plants.'' But once the garden
became permanent, it turned into what she called a nonstop
evolution.
</P>
<P>
   From the very beginning, the Du Vals' intent was to maximize the
view, which encompasses the adjacent Queensboro Bridge and an
uninterrupted sweep of Manhattan skyline. Another plus was the
rooftop's generous footage _ about 2,500 square feet. To divide it
into ``rooms,'' they defined discrete areas with different floor
materials: Mexican beach pebbles around a fountain in the garden
proper, black cast-concrete pavers in the cooking area, lighter
concrete-and-pebble pavers in the living and entertaining section
and cedar planking in the dining room. (The materials can usually
be found at garden-supply stores.) Then, to delineate transitional
routes from one area to the next, they created a series of teak
walkways.
</P>
<P>
   Before any of the floor plan could be put into place, however,
the roof had to be covered with a sealing membrane _ it might be a
silicone sealant, rubber or asphalt _ to prevent water damage and
protect the structural integrity of the building. To keep the
membrane from being punctured, the couple had to make sure that
everything they put on top of it _ flooring frame, irrigation
pipes, paving, pots and furnishings _ was lightweight and
distributed evenly over the surface.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, the roof had a 2 percent gradient, a common
construction element intended to expedite drainage, and just enough
slope to make one leg feel longer than the other and set plants and
furniture at a jaunty tilt. To level the surface, the Du Vals
installed feet, or pods, that screwed into the frame on which the
flooring was laid.
</P>
<P>
   (Another approach they might have considered is precast pedestal
pavers: paving squares that have adjustable built-in feet. They're
laid with open spaces between them to allow for water runoff.)
</P>
<P>
   To provide for shade, a must for a rooftop garden, the Du Vals'
conceived a wood-beamed pergola entwined with fragrant wisteria.
The vine is still in its infancy, but when full grown, it will
cover the structure like a lacy mantle. New-growth trees, shade for
future summers, include rooftop favorites like river birches, black
pines and Japanese cut-leaf maples, as well as the delightful
surprise of Colorado quaking aspens. A reminder of Ms. Du Val's
childhood, aspens are very hard to find here, but seem to do well.
``I've always loved the way their leaves shimmer in the wind,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other hardy plants on the roof include shrubs like Virginia
sweetspire, rhododendron and boxwood; perennials like lavender,
roses, cat's whiskers and pennisetum grass, and annuals like
plumbago, Martha Washington geraniums and clerodendrum. Vines
thrive here, as well: green blankets of Boston ivy mellow the old
brick walls, and passifloras send their wayward tendrils up wall
trellises and up the projectile-shaped  &UR; tuteur &LR;  Ms. Du Val
fashioned from copper plumbing pipe (a contrivance she refers to as
the rocket ship).
</P>
<P>
   In warm-weather months, the Du Vals' rooftop is well equipped
for entertaining. All the furniture _ from the teak ocean-liner
deck chairs to the steel-topped dining table _ is weatherproof and
meant to last a lifetime. But it was also chosen for its lightness
in respect for the weight-bearing limitations of the roof itself.
</P>
<P>
   (New York City codes restrict weight on a roof to 40 to 60
pounds a square foot, depending on the structure of the building,
and that includes people, pots, plants and pets.)

   Dinner parties aren't the only entertainments provided for here.
To amuse bird-watchers, there are feeders that attract dove
couples, finches, larks, hummingbirds, mockingbirds _ even the odd
parakeet. To induce serenity, there's a fountain made from an old
gear mechanism, a remnant of the foundry's earlier life as a
machine-parts manufactory. Du Val drilled a hole in the bottom to
insert a cord for a pump, then sealed the entry hole with silicone.
There's even an overflow pipe to correct the water level _ a handy
device for coping with heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, for warmth on chilly nights, there's an outdoor
fireplace. It is, in fact, a flue-topped barbecue, but the Du Vals
like to use it solely as a hearth _ and given the pure enchantment
of that idea in a rooftop setting, who could blame them?

   Planters That Are Roofproof &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a rooftop, structural stress is a major concern,
so weight is a crucial factor when choosing a planter. Today,
companies like Claycraft produce high-quality fiberglass planters
that are not only as weatherproof as concrete but also 1/8 of the
weight. Unlike concrete or clay, the pots are easily repaired with
fiberglass resin, available in most hardware stores, and won't fade
or peel. And the beauty part is that they look like cement or
stone, bronze or cast iron. Prices range from $40 or $50 for a
15-inch planter, up to $225 for a 25-inch one. You can find
Claycraft products at Gardencrafters, 37 Grand St. (West Broadway);
(212) 268-0530.
</P>
<P>
   Another good source is Roundbush Casting (516 676-6236),
available to the trade through landscape designers, and known for
its fiberglass interpretations of carved stone and lead planters.
Other options include high-tech aluminum containers, available in
garden-supply stores like Mecox Gardens in Southampton. Or even the
plastic pots that plants come in will do. Placed in groups, the
pots disappear beneath the plants' leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget that potting soil can be weighty, so opt for a mix
of topsoil, peat moss and perlite. Or use Pro-Mix, a soil
substitute. But if you do, fertilize with nourishers like fish
emulsion, Bloom Booster (for roses and annuals) or Hollytone (for
evergreens).
</P>
<P>
   Irrigating A Roof Garden
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Because weight on a roof must be evenly distributed,
you'll want lots of smaller plant pots instead of a few large ones.
But since smaller pots dry out quickly, daily watering is essential
_ a problem if a garden is large and time scarce.
</P>
<P>
   The best solution: Before you put down flooring, install an
irrigation system of pipes, spaghetti tubing and timers that can be
preset to water plants automatically. Electrically operated systems
are a better choice for roof gardens than battery-driven ones,
because they can be set for the short watering times that smaller
plants need. An electrically operated system (with a battery
backup) for an 8-by-25-foot garden would cost about $1,200, Tim Du
Val of Plant Specialists in New York said. (And be sure that any
above-the-floor pipes are hidden by greenery.)
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, an irrigation system will be zone-balanced, with tubing
and timers strategically arranged to cover specific areas: one zone
for shrubs and trees, which need longer watering times; one for
small plants. For a larger garden, around 15 by 50 feet, an
electrically operated system that is zone-balanced might cost
$2,500.
</P>
<P>
   Installing an irrigation system _ or for that matter, any part
of a roof garden's flooring _ is best left to professionals. And if
your proposed garden site tops a co-op building, submit an
engineer-designed plan to the board before starting construction.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The first thing people notice about Robert Homma is
his three-foot-long braid. It gleams, it moves, and it ends just
below his waist.
</P>
<P>
   The second thing they notice is that he is surrounded by still
lifes. On the rooftop garden of his apartment near Lincoln Center,
there are patches of velvety moss, each in its own hand-thrown
ceramic pot. There are triptychs of 45-year-old bonsai _ juniper,
maple and elm. Heart-shaped rocks, some pale gray, others dark like
granite, nestle on another bed of moss.
</P>
<P>
   Most people collect objects for indoors. Homma, a partner in
Dimson Homma, a shop on the Upper East Side that sells Ming
furniture, celadon porcelain and rare live birds (and what is a
shop but a place for still lifes?), collects things for indoors _
and outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   For Homma, who is 51 and a third-generation Japanese-American,
collecting for himself, which is nearly synonymous with buying for
the shop, is as much a daily ritual, an exercise of the eye and the
hand, as the braiding of his hair. It began in 1952. That summer,
and for the next 16 summers, his parents packed their three sons _
Robert, then 4; Tom, 8, and Steve, not yet 1 _ into the family car
and drove from Highland Park, Ill., to visit aunts, uncles and
cousins in Pasadena, Calif. Crammed in the back of a car in the
days before air-conditioning and the Discman, what were three
squirming boys to do? Collect, their mother said.
</P>
<P>
   She handed the two older boys a tiny overnight bag and a cookie
tin. ``Every time we made a stop, we'd be encouraged to pick up a
souvenir _ a rock, a leaf, a fossil, an arrowhead,'' Homma said.
</P>
<P>
   In Highland Park, where the boys caught crayfish in the streams
and built forts in trees, Homma discovered the beauty of moss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the verdancy of moss, the greens, the intensity, the
softness,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, he studied painting at the University of Iowa, and
ikebana in Chicago. ``What that does, even more than teaching you
how to arrange flowers,'' he said, ``is train your eye to see
things in nature, the curve of a branch, the composition.'' Moving
to Manhattan in 1982, his first job was making deliveries for food
impresario Eli Zabar. Eight months later, Homma was Zabar's
director of catering.
</P>
<P>
   At home, which he has been renovating for two years, he uses
shoji screens as a serene backdrop for his collections: three
Japanese rice bowls, each carved from a single piece of wood, and
three gourds, two brought back from China and one grown on the
terrace. But the screens also hide his largest collections: 1,000
art books, stored in double rows, and 1,000 compact disks.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 600-square-foot studio, blue predominates. It's
in the Tibetan rugs on the floor and in a French quilt on the bed.
``Some people think blue is cold,'' he said, ``but I think it's
calming.''
</P>
<P>
   If blue is the color within, a hundred shades of green and as
many shades of white rule the 700-square-foot terrace. There are
silvery green junipers, chartreuse cactuses, olive-green grape
leaves. White is the color of the fat clumps of hydrangea, the
masses of impatiens at the foot of the fishpond, and the
night-blooming jasmine, strategically placed at the door of the
studio. At night, the scent of jasmine wafts into the studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``White is the one color you can see at night,'' Homma said.
</P>
<P>
   It is not enough to collect objects, however. Homma also has
pets: Licorice, a standard poodle; Sky, a blue-gray Persian cat,
and Emil, a turtle. And don't forget the godchildren, who come from
California for a week each summer, plopping their sleeping bags on
the floor of what the owner calls ``Camp Homma.''
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there are the friends.
</P>
<P>
   A studio is not necessarily a small place.
</P>
<P>
   Shelves Behind Screens
</P>
<P>
   To store his collections of books and compact disks, Robert
Homma hired a woodworker to build 14-inch-deep pine bookshelves on
four of the existing walls. The shelves, which hold double rows of
books, are adjustable and rest on pegs that fit into holes drilled
into the walls. Concealing the books and CDs are 120 square feet of
custom-made sliding shoji screens of different heights and widths.
The screens are fiberglass paper framed in pine, which Homma
stained a warm shade of brown.
</P>
<P>
   The total cost of the storage system was $7,000 _ $5,000 for the
screens and $2,000 for the shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Shoji screens can be found at Oriental Living, a 20-year-old
company whose specialty is woodworking and making Shoji screens. It
is located at 102-06 Northern Boulevard (at 102nd Street), Corona,
Queens; (718) 476-2360.

   A Wee Bit of Heather
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'm a Scotophile, so I love the idea of heather and am
thinking of planting a clump of it on a slope on the property I've
just bought. Before I do, I'd like to know whether all heather is
purple and, if so, for how much of the year? Will it survive
below-zero tempera-tures? And most im-portant, is it soft? I want
to lie there in my kilt to write poems.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The blooms of true heather, Calluna vulgaris, usually appear
in late summer and last for six to eight weeks. The Heather
Society, an international organization headquartered in Britain,
recognizes 13 flower colors, including amethyst, beetroot, lilac,
lavender, mauve, purple, ruby, shell pink and, for variety, salmon.
White, too. You can expand both palette and bloom season by
planting other members of the Erica family, like heaths. You can
also get a lot of color from the plants themselves. There are
hundreds of heathers, many of which have very showy new growth in
spring, brilliant yellow summer foliage or leaves that turn scarlet
or orange in winter.
</P>
<P>
   Hardiness varies, but in general heathers are tough plants that
can take subzero temperatures, especially with ample snow cover to
protect them. The slope sounds promising; heather needs good
drainage. It also requires acid soil and regular pruning. Left
unsheared, it soon gets gangly and sparse-flowered.
</P>
<P>
   I'd say you'd better have both a tough posterior and some tough
heather before you try the kilt trick, but to quote David Small,
president of the Heather Society, C. vulgaris ``is tough and wiry
and will tolerate the odd person lying on it,'' though it ``would
not tolerate constant trampling.'' He added that several are named
for malt whiskies, and ``there are a number named after parts of
Scotland which might create the right atmosphere'' for writing
poetry. For best results, though, focus on height, not
nomenclature. Among the mauves, for instance, 4 inch tall
Heidepracht is likely to make a more inspiring bed than Macdonald
of Glencoe, which can approach 2 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Heather is planted in spring and fall. Sources with wide
selections include Heaths &AMP; Heathers, 502 East Haskell Hill Road,
Shelton, Wash. 98584-8429, (800) 294-3284,
www.heathsandheathers.com and Rockspray Nursery, P.O. Box 693,
Truro, Mass. 02666, (508) 349-3942, www.rockspray.com. Both
catalogs are free.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to learn more about these fascinating plants,
consider joining a group, either the Heather Society, Denbeigh, All
Saints Road, Creeting St. Mary, Ipswich, Suffolk, IP6 8PJ, England;
or, closer to home, the Northeast Heather Society, 1066 Paper
Street, Suffield, Conn., 06078.
</P>
<P>
   Mystery Irritant
</P>
<P>
   Q. Recently, while clearing overgrown honeysuckle, I pulled up
30 or 40 young thistles. Shortly afterward, I developed itchy,
localized blebs on my hands and face. Could the thistle juices on
my leather gloves have caused an allergic reaction? (In the past,
I've pulled up thistles barehanded without any problem.)
</P>
<P>
   A. Wyman's Garden Encyclopedia describes the highly invasive
Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense) as a vicious weed, and you could
probably raise a rash by rubbing your skin with its prickly leaves.
But neither this nor any other thistle shows up on standard lists
of common allergens.
</P>
<P>
   You might have an unusual allergy; almost everything disagrees
with somebody. But before you see the doctor, I suggest you
consider the likelihood of plain old poison ivy. That evil vine
often lurks unsuspected in overgrown places and is frequently seen
(or, alas, not seen) in conjunction with honeysuckle.
</P>
<P>
   The Fruiting Body
</P>
<P>
   Q. I've been told that in deadheading day lilies, it's necessary
to take off the fruiting body. What's that?
</P>
<P>
   A. Technically, a fruiting body is the spore-making part of
plants that don't flower, like mosses, or of nonplants, like
mushrooms. But the term is also often used to mean the fleshy green
seedpods (technically, the fruit) of plants not known for fruit
making. If you peel away a wilted day lily flower that's still
attached to the stem, you'll see a tiny, olive-shape growth at the
base _ the fruit. Snap it off carefully, where it meets the stem,
so you don't hurt developing buds on the same scape (leafless
flower-bearing stem that rises from ground level).
</P>
<P>
   Address questions to Garden Q&AMP;A, The New York Times, 229 West
43d Street, New York 10036, or by e-mail to

<P>
   SAN JOSE , Calif. _ For the average Internet user in the United
States, life is a never-ending stream of dilemmas: Upgrade now or
later. Order ISDN or wait for cable modem service to arrive. Buy
the Palm V organizer or go with the one that connects to the Web.
Check e-mail while on vacation or leave the laptop at home.
</P>
<P>
   But a conference held here in June underscored a very different
reality: in many corners of the world, there are dozens of
developing countries where widespread access to the Internet _ of
any kind _ remains a distant possibility.
</P>
<P>
   While it is true that some of the earth's most remote places are
now linked to the Net _ one recent addition is Bhutan, a small
kingdom in the Himalayas, which inaugurated its first Internet link
last month _ there are still no connections at all in Iraq, North
Korea and a handful of African countries.
</P>
<P>
   In many countries that have Internet connections, Net access is
concentrated in the largest cities and is prohibitively expensive
when set against an individual's typical income. That expense
largely restricts the use of the Internet to an elite, mostly made
up of foreigners, government workers and business people. And in
some cases, government censors put the Internet out of reach for
most people in their countries.
</P>
<P>
   The conference here, called INET 99, was the annual meeting of
the Internet Society, a nonprofit group that coordinates
Internet-related projects around the world and has the motto
``Internet Is for Everyone.'' Each year, the group holds a
three-day conference; previous locations have included Prague,
Montreal, Geneva and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 1,600 network administrators, academics and business
people gathered at the gleaming, cavernous San Jose Convention
Center in the heart of Silicon Valley. That backdrop accentuated
the fast-paced, high-risk, moneyed world of high technology, a
world very far away from the everyday experiences of the people
attending from developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   Many people at the conference, from places like Japan, Germany,
Finland and the Netherlands, were sophisticated Internet users,
concerned with cutting-edge technical issues. But many others were
from countries where Internet connections are available to only a
privileged few.
</P>
<P>
   ``It created a sort of schizophrenia,'' said Will Foster, a
research assistant at the University of Arizona in Tucson who
attended the conference. ``The presentations by eBay and E-trade
highlighted the tension between the go-go growth of Internet
start-up companies in Silicon Valley and the realities of Internet
connectivity in countries like Cameroon.''
</P>
<P>
   Each year, a workshop is held for a week preceding the
conference; this year, 143 people from 66 developing nations
attended. It is aimed at sending participants home with additional
technical and administrative skills for running networks.
</P>
<P>
   Those accepted for the workshop _ 570 people applied _ have
basic technical skills. ``They also have to have leverage within
their organization, and the organization has to have leverage in
the country _ for example, someone running networking for the major
university in the country or within the PTT,'' said George
Sadowsky, the Internet Society's vice president for education,
referring to the shorthand used for many countries' national
telecommunications providers.
</P>
<P>
   The demographics of the workshop shift each year, as
telecommunications needs change across the world. The first
workshop, in 1993, had a large contingent of Eastern Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   This year, more than half of the participants were from Africa,
which accounted for about 13 percent of the world's population but
just 1 percent of the world's Internet users as of the end of
March, according to data from Mike Jensen, a consultant with the
Association for Progressive Communications, a nonprofit group based
in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding South Africa (where one in every 177 people uses the
Internet), for every 4,123 Africans, there is just one person who
uses the Internet, according to Jensen's figures.
</P>
<P>
   Wawa A. Ngenge, the national coordinator for the Sustainable
Development Networking Program in Cameroon, said his country got
its first Internet connection in 1997. Internet service providers
there pay the national phone company $3,000 per month for a
64-kilobits-per-second line, which is not much faster than the
fastest dial-up modem; such slow speeds are common in developing
countries and mean that ISP customers must put up with very slow
speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Just 15,000 people out of 15 million have Internet access, all
of it concentrated in the capital, Yaounde. Using the Internet
costs about $3 per hour in Cameroon, a country where the average
civil servant makes about $200 a month, Ngenge said.
</P>
<P>
   One thing slowing the Internet's spread in developing countries
is the fact that many governments there enjoy a telephone monopoly.
Sadowsky said such governments feared that the Internet might
reduce the revenue from international telephone calls and faxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Telecommunications rates are extraordinarily high,'' Sadowsky
said. ``In the worst case, the PTT provides one-fifth of a
country's GNP. Part of our work is in convincing countries that if
you ignore the Internet, you'll keep your telephone revenues the
same, but you'll pay in opportunity cost, in terms of economic and
social development.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the main conference began, those who had attended the
workshop found little use for the general sessions, many of which
focused on state-of-the-art wireless communications, e-commerce,
venture capital and the development of Internet II.
</P>
<P>
   After a panelist at one session mentioned that 40 percent of all
venture money was invested within a 40-mile radius of where he was
sitting, a member of the audience asked about the prospects for
venture capital investments in the developing world. ``Remember,
we're technology investors,'' the panelist answered politely.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're so far away from us,'' Ngenge said of conference
participants from wealthier countries. ``We're worrying about two
different sets of problems.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One prominent set of problems is, of course, political. In Laos,
for instance, the government considers the Internet a destabilizing
influence because of the free flow of information associated with
the Web and keeps connections scarce, said Paula Uimonen, a Swedish
researcher in Geneva who is studying the Internet in Laos and
presented a paper at the conference. ``It's obvious that it's a
lack of political willingness,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In some countries, users who can connect to the Internet
sometimes find that access to certain sites is blocked, according
to Human Rights Watch. The group said that some Mideast countries,
for example, blocked access to political sites under the guise of
protecting users from pornography.
</P>
<P>
   Laos has had e-mail since late 1994, Ms. Uimonen said, and got
its first ISP last year. There are 1,000 Internet users, most of
whom are foreigners. There are two cybercafes in the capital,
Vientiane, but Laotians are not allowed in.
</P>
<P>
   The connection of Myanmar, formerly Burma, to the Internet
remains similarly tenuous. All modems must be registered with the
government, which is run by the military, Sadowsky said. Neither
Laos nor Myanmar had representatives at the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration policies can make it hard for people to get to the
conference. Two Cubans were invited to participate in the workshop,
but one was not given a visa and because of that, the other stayed
home. A person from Sudan was registered for the conference and had
a visa but was detained by the Immigration and Naturalization
Service in New York, then sent back to Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   A 24-year-old network administrator from Hanoi named Tuan Bui
Anh arrived in California without incident. He said Vietnam got its
first Internet connection in late 1997. Before that, computer users
could send e-mail but could not go out on the Web. Net Nam, the
main ISP, and four other service providers have connections
concentrated in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.
</P>
<P>
   E-commerce has yet to make an impression in places like Vietnam,
where few people have credit cards. Following a keynote speech
given by Meg Whitman, chief executive of the eBay auction site,
Tuan seemed a bit bewildered. ``I think this is for the Americans
only,'' he said.

INSIDE OUT AND OUTSIDE IN: A NEW GARDEN STYLE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The story goes that when Philip Johnson showed Frank Lloyd
Wright inside his 1949 glass house in New Canaan, Conn., the father
of Fallingwater and other architectural masterpieces asked if he
was meant to take off his hat.
</P>
<P>
   Today, if Wright could see what's going on outside the house, he
might be forgiven for not putting his hat back on as he left.
</P>
<P>
   The craze for picture windows and patios during the 1950s and
60s that became the gardening renaissance of the 80s that became
the boom in casual outdoor living in the early 1990s has found its
endgame: outdoor interior decoration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gone from furnishing the outdoors to decorating the
outdoors,'' said Bruce Butterfield, the research director of the
National Gardening Association in Burlington, Vt. ``What people are
trying to do is replicate the popular great rooms in their houses,
but in open air.'' Think ceilings as high as the sky.
</P>
<P>
   The garden's plants and flowers have become a genus of home
accents and accessories. In 1998, Americans bought $1.82 billion
worth of casual furniture, as the industry calls summer and outdoor
furnishings, an increase of 12.3 percent over 1997, according to
Garden Decor, a new trade publication. This was more than double
the increase from 1996 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable how big a business it's become,'' said Cindy
Sheaffer, the editor of Garden Decor. ``And there are all kinds of
retailers getting into the business, from mass merchants like
Target to new specialty stores, selling garden style for inside or
outside the home.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the furniture is out there, the walls are going up.
Trellises and other ``verticals'' are hot. So is water: decorative
fountains and sculptural sprinkler systems. Think of it as outdoor
plumbing.
</P>
<P>
   Style wars are breaking out.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going on, on the decorating side?'' Butterfield asked.
``The Mediterranean `virgin olive oil' look, the English cottage
look, the Southwestern theme, Asian theme, the Adirondack camp
look. Outdoor styles are mimicking indoor styles; the fantasy
element indoors is being brought outdoors.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith &AMP; Hawken, the Mill Valley, Calif., company that originally
sold only high-end gardening tools, was one of the first with
garden furnishings for full-scale decorating. The company's sales
just crossed the $100 million mark. According to Kathy Tierney,
Smith &AMP; Hawken's chief executive, the two weeks before and after
the Fourth of July are the apex of outdoor decorating, during which
the floor space in the company's 40 stores nationwide and the pages
of its catalogs are devoted to furnishings, not tools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashionable interest has forced us to move off-center a
little, away from English and European, to Asian,'' she said of
this season's outdoor furnishing styles. ``It's like the food
fusion thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The other big exterior-decoration trend, she said, is
``grandmother's garden, the old-fashioned American grandma's
garden. All the plants that were declasse five years ago: zinnias,
dahlias, gladiolas.''
</P>
<P>
   All the little-old-lady furniture _ the porch gliders and
garden-variety 1940s bent-metal lawn chairs and mirrored gazing
balls _ go with them.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happened to bare feet and grass?
</P>
<P>
   Americans spent over $30 billion last year on their gardens and
lawns, up 13 percent from 1997, according to the National Gardening
Association. But they are cultivating a new level of comfort. The
association says that in 1998, over 35 million households _ out of
a total of 100 million households in the United States _ bought an
``outdoor living product,'' which includes everything from
furniture to grills to arbors.
</P>
<P>
   Gardening as a style, doesn't need soil any more than hydroponic
tomatoes do. Outdoor casual living is a trend that accommodates
those who may or may not actually have a garden.
</P>
<P>
   Gardening has a strong, natural pull when it comes to pushing
non-horticultural products, said Cheryl Trine, the founder of
Garden Net Inc., a Web site for gardening information
(www.gardennet.com), with electronic advertising links to
retailers, from nurseries to ornamental garden furniture to tools
and power equipment. ``It's almost as good an appeal as sex for
selling,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Trine's online surveys have shown her that her audience is
25 to 45 years old, as likely to be living in apartments and
furnishing terraces as living in houses and spading dirt. They
include the next generation of gardeners, behind the baby boomers
who unearthed the garden-chic trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``What interests me is how successfully companies like Smith &AMP;
Hawken have equated gardening with status,'' Ms. Trine said.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by over a million visits to her site monthly, she is
introducing a pay-per-view magazine in September.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers are throwing themselves at garden style like bugs at
blue lights. There are 159 gardening magazines, according to the
Magazine Publishers of America (by comparison, there are 119
interior-design and decoration titles). Twelve were introduced last
year; five in 1997. The start-ups are attacking every angle of the
market. New Eden, which showed up in May, is a kind of Wallpaper
for the outdoors: a ``downtown'' gardening magazine. Rebecca's
Gardening, which Hearst introduced in April, is a magazine for
``garden interest,'' which includes cooking and craft projects.
Rebecca Kolls, the former television weather reporter who is its
creative director, has a syndicated television program. She is
being presented as a down-market Martha Stewart, who promises
garden projects that can be achieved in less than 30 minutes for
less than $50.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gardening's bigger than it's ever been,'' Ms. Kolls said.
``But it's bigger for a different reason. People want a beautiful
place, but `Show me how to do it easily' is what they tell me.''
Ms. Kolls doesn't use the Latin in naming plants, for instance,
which she said got her into ``a lot of trouble'' with traditional
gardeners.
</P>
<P>
   Older titles are adjusting their focus. Garden Design, the
five-year-old magazine which has consciously consolidated gardening
with issues of style, intends to double its pages devoted to
interior decoration in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Container gardens have been the big winner in the new landscape
of interest. They come in every style, from Tuscan terra cotta to
Vietnamese pottery. A new generation of durable, inexpensive,
lightweight synthetics has made them even more attractive. Sales
for containers increased 36 percent in 1998 over the previous year,
the gardening association says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of it in interior decoration terms,'' said Butterfield,
the association's research director. ``People on their decks can
bring their gardens right into their living spaces, like a bouquet
of flowers on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tierney of Smith &AMP; Hawken said that the company's SoHo store
was one of its most successful, largely because of container
gardening.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fashion element,'' she explained. ``It doesn't have to
be permanent. You can be a dabbler.''
</P>
<P>
   You can also create it quickly, then sit down and watch it over
a cocktail, instead of weeding until it's too dark to see.
Pressures on people's time has produced a shorter growing season
that has nothing to do with plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's kind of the sad part about it,'' said Ms. Kolls, now
doing double duty as a magazine and television personality, when
asked about how much time she finds to spend in her garden. ``I'm
always working in someone else's garden, for the show. Mine's kind
of thin.''

TIMES SQUARE'S TKTS BOOTH WILL BE A TOUGH ACT TO FOLLOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID W. DUNLAP   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, the TKTS booth that
ornaments Times Square like an oversize red-and-white box kite is
one of the ``symbols of the renaissance'' of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   To Ron Silver, the actor and chairman of the official NYC 2000
millennium committee, the booth is ``Times Square's centerpiece.''
</P>
<P>
   To John Breglio, chairman of the Theater Development Fund, which
built and operates the booth, it is a ``symbol of Broadway theater
to an entire generation'' and ``perhaps one of the country's most
successful graphic designs.'' The booth sells discounted same-day
tickets for performances of Broadway productions.
</P>
<P>
   You would think they were about to nominate the innovative
26-year-old, pipe-and-canvas structure for landmark designation.
But with these words of praise on June 15, they buried it.
</P>
<P>
   The officials announced a competition for architects, landscape
architects and graphic designers to design a new TKTS booth, which
would open next year on the site of the present booth, at the north
end of Times Square, which is known as Duffy Square.
</P>
<P>
   The competition seems to doom one more facet of Broadway's
architectural past, which has been chipped away piece by piece in
recent years until very little remains of what was once a
splendidly pungent esthetic amalgam, made of dozens of incongruous
icons layered one on top of another. (In a notable exception to the
bulldozing rule, the former I. Miller Building at Broadway and 46th
Street, ornamented by four sculptures by Alexander Stirling Calder,
was designated an official landmark June 29.)
</P>
<P>
   While preservation advocates believe a landmark case could be
made for the TKTS booth, as a practical matter it is ineligible for
designation until 2003, when it turns 30. And it probably wouldn't
stand up that long.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become necessary to build a new structure,'' said Jack
Goldstein, executive director of the Theater Development Fund,
explaining the need for a new booth. ``Time and weather have taken
their toll.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials hope that a new design will speed the lines of
ticketgoers that jam Duffy Square, hundreds at a time at peak
periods; make life more comfortable for those who work inside the
cramped structure, and raise the visual profile of the booth, which
has been overshadowed by the new gigantism of Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Even John Schiff, who designed the booth in 1973 with Robert
Mayers, believes its time may be past. Indeed, he noted, it was
meant to be temporary. ``Change is fine,'' Schiff said. ``But I
think it's going to be a tough act to follow.''
</P>
<P>
   That is true of all of Broadway's lost icons: the Parthenon-like
Rivoli Theater, the jukebox-modern Rialto Theater, the charming
neon Simple Simon and Pieman sign at Howard Johnson's, even the
utilitarian armed forces recruiting station. Each spoke in its own
eccentric, irreplaceable way of the evolution of Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   And the TKTS booth tells a tale in its slapdash, improvisational
style of a dark moment in the early 1970s when Broadway was
desperate for resuscitation but so strapped for cash that solutions
had to be crafted from bubble gum and baling wire _ the big-city
version of, ``Gee, we can use the back of the garage for a stage
and turn mom's old sheets into curtains.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Mayor John V. Lindsay, the Office of Midtown Planning and
Development lent a city-owned trailer to the Theater Development
Fund to be used as a booth for the sale of half-priced tickets on
the day of the performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a donated trailer and a can of paint,'' Schiff
recalled. The architects were instructed simply to ornament the
trailer with supergraphics. They feared such a small gesture would
look anemic in Times Square but they had almost no money to do
anything else; the capital budget was a paltry $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Then they hit on the idea of using a portion of the operating
budget to rent pipes on a monthly basis from the R.C. Mugler
scaffolding company in the Bronx. With these, they built an open
framework around the trailer, effectively quadrupling its volume
and considerably elevating its profile.
</P>
<P>
   To increase visibility further, they stretched translucent
plastic panels between the pipes, some of them woven through the
structure diagonally. And they painted the abbreviation ``TKTS'' in
a bold typeface called Helvetica, using letters six feet high.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, to keep the whole structure from blowing away, they
lashed it with steel cables to four chunky concrete anchors at each
corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took four days to install,'' Schiff said. ``We weren't
designing for the millennium. We were designing for one year.''
</P>
<P>
   The TKTS booth was an instant hit. In its first day of operation
in June 1973, it sold 155 tickets; in its first week, 6,961. Since
then _ this almost sounds like a McDonald's billboard _ more than
36.5 million tickets have been sold there.
</P>
<P>
   The booth won a design award in 1973 from the New York Society
of Architects and a Bard Award in 1975 from the City Club of New
York for merit in civic architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Ned Kaufman, an associate director of the Municipal Art Society,
said many people regard the booth as ``a classic of early '70s
design.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The sense of temporariness was part of the temper of the
times,'' he said. ``It also expresses the spirit of the enterprise,
which is, `Let's go to the theater tonight.' That sense of being
cobbled together for the moment seems very expressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Theodore H.M. Prudon, an architect who is active in the
documentation and conservation of modernist design, said the booth
is notable for its esthetic qualities, sociological role and
technological innovation. ``It's the beginning of scaffold-like,
high-tech, tensile structures,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The TKTS booth was built as the Pompidou Center was being
constructed in Paris, but Schiff said he was not inspired by _
indeed, at the time might not have even known about _ the veinous,
transparently expressed steel armature designed by Renzo Piano,
Richard Rogers and Gianfranco Franchini. In any case, the booth
opened four years before the Pompidou Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Van Alen Institute, which is administering the competition,
has called for ``a design statement as memorable as the current
booth,'' whether it ``thoroughly reinvents or reinterprets the
current design.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the jury, announced earlier this week, include the
architects Enrique Norten and Marion Weiss; the landscape architect
Kathryn Gustafson and the designers Tucker Viemeister and Tony
Walton. The institute expects to receive at least 200 entries by
the Oct. 14 deadline. The first prize is $5,000. More information
is available at www.vanalen.org.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein said he had offered the old structure to the
Smithsonian Institution ``because I myself recognize the booth
definitely as a moment in the cultural history of America and in
design history.''
</P>
<P>
   Schiff, now a principal at Einhorn Yaffee Prescott, doubts that
he will enter the competition. He and Mayers sold their practice
two years ago and Mayers has retired.
</P>
<P>
   Would they have done anything differently with the TKTS booth?
``Bob Mayers only regretted that we didn't charge a fee on the
basis of ticket sales,'' Schiff said.

MEXICAN INVESTOR SUES TEXAS SECURITIES FIRM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MacCORMACK  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ A Mexico City man has filed a lawsuit against the
San Antonio investment firm InverWorld Securities, alleging
mismanagement of an account valued at more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, investigators from the Securities and Exchange
Commission have visited the InverWorld offices and the Texas State
Securities Board is looking into the firm's activities.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit filed late Friday in state district court, Mexico
City resident Cesar Garcia Mendez claims he lost $1.38 million
invested in money market funds through IWG Services, an InverWorld
affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   The suit names InverWorld chief executive Jose Zollino and four
related companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Garcia has made repeated requests to Zollino and the
InverWorld defendants to return the funds into the money market
accounts into which they were deposited, but Zollino and the ...
defendants have refused to do so,'' the suit says.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit further charges that Garcia's funds were transferred
without his permission from money market funds into ``IWG Notes,''
promissory notes issued by InverWorld.
</P>
<P>
   The suit asks for an order freezing all InverWorld accounts
holding Garcia's investments.
</P>
<P>
   The investment firm's lawyer, Sarah Foster of Austin, and
InverWorld officials have not responded to repeated requests for
information. Reporters visiting the firm Tuesday were turned away.
</P>
<P>
   InverWorld is a U.S.-registered brokerage with affiliate
operations in Matamoros, Monterrey, Guadalajara and Mexico City.
InverWorld lists affiliates or offices in Switzerland, Great
Britain, the Cayman Islands, Argentina and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   Most of its clients are wealthy Mexicans, many from the northern
states.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of worried Mexicans have visited the plush new InverWorld
offices since a June 25 announcement that its London affiliate, IWG
Services Inc., was being liquidated.
</P>
<P>
   ``IWG Services Ltd. and its affiliates have suffered severe
financial setbacks in connection with emerging markets and other
investments,'' the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
   ``IWG is currently in the process of retaining an experienced
international accounting firm to handle the wind down of IWG, the
orderly management and liquidation of its assets and to ensure that
all net funds are appropriately distributed to its customers,'' the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The news created panic in Matamoros, resulting in the abrupt
closure of InverWorld's office there.
</P>
<P>
   A San Antonio lawyer hired by InverWorld investors said he met
with Zollino last week but couldn't get a clear understanding of
the relationship between InverWorld and IWG Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first he told us it was a sister entity, which means there
must be a parent somewhere. Then he said, `We have a contract with
them,' and later he said they are just a client, just like you have
an accountant,'' said the lawyer, who asked that he not be
identified.

 A VIDEO HELPS PSYCHIATRISTS EXPERIENCE VIRTUAL SCHIZOPHRENIA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ALICIA AULT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Virtual reality can offer users a chance to enter into a variety
of fantasies. Most are appealing. But at a recent meeting of the
American Psychiatric Association, psychiatrists, and others could
spend three to five minutes experiencing an animated version of the
auditory and visual hallucinations that plague many schizophrenics.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the experience is unsettling. Wearing a headset
and earphones, you are immersed in a video in which it seems that
you walk into a psychiatrist's office and sit in front of his desk.
Once there, you are immediately aware of classical music playing
lightly in the background, but it's not clear if it's just Muzak or
it's in your head. As the psychiatrist asks you about your weekend,
voices denounce him, saying he doesn't really care. To the right, a
mouse scurries across an oriental carpet.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back to the doctor, the digital clock on his desk has
moved ahead an hour or so. The magazine on the opposite corner says
``Man of the Year,'' but a second later, the headline melts into
``they're trying to poison you.'' A spider crawls through the air.
As you desperately try to focus on the psychiatrist, he morphs into
a three-eyed monster and sprouts horns. The voices are reaching a
fever pitch, telling you that you aren't human, nothing matters,
get out, run.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind the video, which plays over a headset, is to
give psychiatrists some sense of what their patients might be going
through. It was developed by Janssen Pharmaceutica of Titusville,
N.J., , as an amalgam of the real experiences of several
schizophrenics. Janssen makes an antipsychotic medication used by
schizophrenics.
</P>
<P>
   Angry voices, white noise and disturbing visions haunt many of
the nation's two million schizophrenics. It is a hell on earth,
says Ken Steele, a schizophrenic who spent 32 years under the yoke
of a constant auditory tongue-lashing and the occasional sighting
of the Virgin Mary. Steele, who says he now has his illness under
control with medication, says he believed that radio and TV
personalities were speaking directly to him, telling him he was a
loser. This was layered over a background of static and suicidal
thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can imagine what that's like when you're on the streets of
New York,'' Steele says, noting that he spent many years wandering
homeless through Manhattan. Steele's nightmare was used as raw
material, along with the experiences of other schizophrenics to
create the animated video.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, schizophrenics, unlike psychiatrists, can't walk
away. ``I can turn down the volume of a radio, I can shut off the
TV, or close the door to my office when I want to concentrate, but
when people with schizophrenia experience this, there is no button
they can push to shut it off,'' says Mary Rappaport, a spokeswoman
at the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Several psychiatrists at the meeting said they found the
experience useful. Zenadia Mangonon, a staff psychiatrist at the
Ancora Psychiatric Hospital, a state institution in New Jersey,
says, ``It's really something to experience yourself what your
patients feel.'' Another, Jim Jacobs of Mercy Hospital in
Pittsburgh, says that until he saw the video, he did not interpret
a patient's distraction as a sign of hallucinations.
</P>
<P>
   Janssen first showed the system to psychiatrists, but when it
can be scaled down _ each headset at the exhibit was linked by 50
feet of cable to its own 400-megahertz Apple G3 _ it may be offered
more widely. Janssen is considering bringing it to physician's
offices, community support group meetings, and medical schools, so
families, social workers, and psychiatrists-in-training can get a
glimpse of the reality of schizophrenia.

PERSONAL HEALTH: FINDING THE RIGHT WAY TO KEEP LYME DISEASE AT

   This is no time to get complacent about Lyme disease, the most
common tick-borne illness in the country. Although the Food and
Drug Administration licensed the first Lyme disease vaccine for
people in December, we continue to have problems preventing this
usually treatable but sometimes devastating bacterial disease. The
three-dose vaccine is effective but not perfect, and
disease-bearing ticks are expected to be unusually abundant this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Even if fully vaccinated, everyone who ventures outdoors in
areas where ticks carrying the Lyme bacteria are likely to be
present is at risk of contracting the disease and would be wise to
observe all the usual precautions about preventing tick bites.
These bacteria, spirochetes with the scientific name Borrelia
burgdorferi, are typically carried by tiny deer ticks that feed on
white-footed mice and lizards as well as deer, people and pets.
</P>
<P>
   The new vaccine, called Lymerix and marketed by SmithKline
Beecham, was not greeted with unbridled enthusiasm by the FDA's
advisory committee, which reluctantly recommended its approval. In
fact, the head of the committee, Dr. Patricia L. Ferrieri of the
University of Minnesota Medical School, said at the time, ``It's
rare that a vaccine is voted on with such ambivalence and such a
stack of provisos.''
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine is highly unusual. It works by attacking the Lyme
organisms while they are still in an infected tick; the attack
occurs when the tick starts feeding on the blood of a vaccinated
person. The vaccine triggers the production of antibodies to a
protein called OspA on the coat of the spirochetes. It takes 24 to
72 hours of feeding time before the tick sends spirochetes through
its saliva into an unsuspecting host. So as the tick begins to
extract its meal of blood, antibodies from the vaccinated person
are consumed along with it and kill the spirochetes before they
reach the tick's saliva.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine is given in three doses _ the first two are a month
apart and the third comes 11 months later _ at a total cost of
about $150 (not including doctor fees). If just the first two doses
are taken, the vaccine is only 50 percent effective in preventing
Lyme disease. All three doses were shown in studies involving
nearly 11,000 people to be 78 percent effective, and a more recent
study by the manufacturer indicated that the vaccine works equally
well if the third dose is given after six months.
</P>
<P>
   This means, however, that even when people are fully vaccinated,
about one person in five remains at risk of getting Lyme disease.
Also, the immunity wears off with time, and booster doses, perhaps
given annually, are likely to be needed.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, since the tests for safety and effectiveness were
conducted on people between the ages of 15 and 70, the vaccine has
not yet been approved for use in children and the elderly. Nor was
the vaccine tested in pregnant women, so it is not known if it is
safe for them to be immunized. The manufacturer is now testing the
vaccine in children 4 to 15 years of age, a group more likely than
most adults to be cavorting in areas where ticks are found.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem involves the ability to diagnose a case of Lyme
disease accurately in a vaccinated person. The usual test, called
Elisa, may appear positive even though the person is not infected,
and doctors may have to use the more costly Western blot test.
</P>
<P>
   There are also long-term safety concerns. The human immune
system has a nasty habit of making mistakes; it sometimes produces
antibodies to its own tissues, resulting in autoimmune diseases.
The OspA protein on the spirochete's coat resembles a protein in
the human body, and there is a real concern that in some vaccinated
people, the immune system will begin attacking itself and
spirochetes, resulting in an incurable illness requiring potent
medications to control.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA advisory committee also has raised concerns about
whether vaccinated people are at greater than average risk of
acquiring treatment-resistant arthritis, neurological damage or
heart disease, all of which can occur in people with severe
untreated Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term surveillance _ for a decade or more _ is needed to
determine whether such risks exist, and so far vaccinated
individuals have been followed for only a few years. The Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention recommends against vaccinating
people who have had treatment-resistant Lyme arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   Lyme disease has been reported in 48 states. But Lyme-carrying
ticks are most abundant in the Northeast, the Upper Midwest and
some parts of Northern California and the Pacific Northwest. For
people who work or frequently play in wooded or overgrown grassy
areas where Lyme disease and deer are common, the prevailing advice
is that the benefits of vaccination outweigh any known or potential
risks. Travelers to such areas may consider vaccination if they
expect to experience frequent or prolonged exposure to tick
habitat.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the greatest risk of being vaccinated would be
complacency about the chances of getting Lyme disease. Remember,
the vaccine does not always work. Even if you are fully immunized,
experts say that the usual anti-tick precautions are needed: cover
up and use a tick repellent. When out in or around tick habitats,
wear long sleeves and light-colored long pants with cuffs tucked
into your socks. Spray your pants, socks and shoes with a tick
repellent, like permethrin, and use Deet on exposed skin.
</P>
<P>
   Pets can be protected with a repellent that is applied between
the shoulders each month during tick season. It spreads across the
skin and kills ticks before they can transmit Lyme disease. Ask
your veterinarian what is best for your pet.
</P>
<P>
   After every outing in tick-infested areas, take off all your
clothes and check your skin for ticks. Also check your pets and
children. In fact, making a family tick check a part of your daily
routine is a good idea, because the prompt removal of ticks can
help prevent infection. Deer ticks are very small and have
elongated bodies (the more common wood ticks are larger and round).
The deer tick, about the size of a poppy seed when it first
attaches, enlarges as it feeds. Do not touch the tick when you
remove it. Use a fine-pointed tweezer or a simple plastic
spoon-like tool called Ticked Off, sold in some pharmacies and
stores catering to outdoor activities.
</P>
<P>
   Also pay attention to every red circular rash you may develop
whether or not you have removed a tick from that area. A
``bulls-eye'' rash that often clears in the center as it spreads
outward is the hallmark of a Lyme infection. So are flu-like
symptoms. Arthritis, neurological symptoms and heart abnormalities
occur weeks to months after infection, and are considered signs of
late disease. So act fast. Get to a doctor without delay if you
suspect infection.
</P>
<P>
   Lyme disease is diagnosed definitively through a blood test,
although waiting for the results can delay needed treatment. If
Lyme disease is treated early with effective antibiotics, the
debilitating, long-lasting consequences can almost always be
prevented. Early cases are best treated with one of three
antibiotics taken for 10 to 21 days: amoxicillin (500 milligrams
three times a day), doxycycline (100 milligrams twice a day) or
cefuroxime axetil (500 milligrams twice a day).

FIRST AND LAST ANNUAL SEXY SWIMSUIT ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 11)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
(th) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Usually respectable publications _ from Sports Illustrated to
Vogue _ regularly fling modesty to the winds and publish annual
best-selling  &UR; swimsuit &LR;  issues. Because most ogling readers are
more interested in an ambience of prurience _ that is, nearly nude
women's bodies _ than in sports or fashion, these issues sell
gazillions of copies.
</P>
<P>
   And so I ask: why not an annual  &UR; swimsuit &LR;  language column? And
when did they stop calling them  &UR; bathing suits &LR; ?
</P>
<P>
   ``Her petticoat, the most important part of her  &UR; bathing
costume &LR; , dropped off,'' wrote Frances Trollope in her 1830
``Domestic Manners of the Americans,'' in what was one of the most
intriguing lines of the English author's tart sociological study.
It was also the first use of  &UR; bathing costume &LR; . Four decades later,
 &UR; bathing suit &LR;  came along and for a time competed with  &UR; bathing
dress &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Then Annette Kellerman, an Australian-born swimmer and diving
star, announced before World War I, ``I can't swim wearing more
stuff than you hang on a clothesline,'' and appeared in a one-piece
outfit with short sleeves, knee-length pants and a round high neck,
which was basically the underwear for the skirted  &UR; bathing dress &LR; .
Although Kellerman was arrested in Boston for appearing in public
in the scandalous garb, in 1913 Carl Jantzen and his partners, John
and Roy Zehntbauer, marketed a skirtless one-piece  &UR; bathing suit &LR; 
for women.
</P>
<P>
   In the Roaring '20s, just as  &UR; bathing beauty &LR;  was catching on,
 &UR; bathing &LR;  _ dipping or immersing oneself in water _ began to give
way to  &UR; swimming &LR; , propelling oneself in water with the arms. In
1926, in ``The Sun Also Rises,'' Ernest Hemingway had a character
say, ``I found my  &UR; swimming suit &LR; , wrapped it with a comb in a
towel.'' That led to the clipped  &UR; swimsuit &LR;  and the more inclusive
 &UR; swimwear &LR; . In France in the '20s, the word  &UR; maillot &LR; , possibly
based on the name of the costumier of the Paris Opera, described a
tight-fitting  &UR; bathing costume &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, after the explosion of an atomic bomb at the Bikini
Atoll in the Marshall Islands became synonymous with a great blast,
the French lingerie manufacturer Louis Reard introduced a skimpy
two-piece suit for swimming or sunbathing that he called the
 &UR; bikini &LR; . Eighteen long years of dreary skin coverage passed before
the Austrian designer Rudi Gernreich interpreted the  &UR; bi &LR;  in
 &UR; bikini &LR;  as ``two'' and introduced the  &UR; monokini &LR;  _ one bottom, no
top.
</P>
<P>
   Lascivious lexicographers have closely examined  &UR; -kini &LR;  as a
popular combining form. The  &UR; trikini &LR;  appeared briefly _ very
briefly _ in 1967, defined as ``a handkerchief and two small
saucers.'' It reappeared a few years ago as a  &UR; bikini &LR;  bottom with
a stringed halter of two triangular pieces of cloth covering the
breasts.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent evolution of the  &UR; -kini &LR;  family is the
 &UR; tankini &LR; , a cropped  &UR; tank top &LR;  supported by spaghetti-like
strings. ``The  &UR; tank &LR;  was the early term for `indoor pool,'''
recalls Steve Fritz, now president of Jantzen, ``and you wore a
one-piece suit when you competed in the tank.'' (Annette Kellerman,
``the Diving Venus'' in her one-piece bathing suit, splashed about
in a huge indoor tank in the Hippodrome in New York City.)
</P>
<P>
   An early  &UR; tank top &LR;  citation is an article in The New Yorker in
1968 about Suzanne Farrell, describing her as ``a tall, pretty
ballerina dressed in a purple  &UR; tank top &LR;  and baggy rubber warm-up
pants.'' It has come to mean a sleeveless garment, often knitted,
with deeply scooped armholes.
</P>
<P>
   Stripping to essentials, if the  &UR; trikini &LR;  is three pieces, the
 &UR; bikini &LR;  two and the  &UR; monokini &LR;  one, when will we see the
 &UR; zerokini &LR; ? We have, and it is a practice, not a garment, called
 &UR; skinny dipping &LR; , from dipping one's naked skin in the water, a
locution cited in the Oxford English Dictionary in 1966. (I
remember it being used in Camp Copake, N.Y., much earlier, but will
name no names.)
</P>
<P>
   __
</P>
<P>
   On a related subject, what's going on in underwear nomenclature?
</P>
<P>
   Remember  &UR; undies &LR; ? Or  &UR; unmentionables? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   They are now mentionable, sort of. These are euphemisms for
 &UR; foundation garments &LR; , or  &UR; corsets &LR; . Ignored politicians complain
that their story was ``buried in the back of the paper with the
 &UR; corset &LR;  ads,'' but has anybody recently seen an ad anywhere for a
 &UR; corset &LR; ?
</P>
<P>
   `` &UR; Shapewear &LR;  _  &UR; Bodyslimmers &LR;  _ is the most prominent thing in
the market today,'' says Tom Wyatt, a former president of Warnaco
Intimate Apparel. In 1984, the Olga company of Van Nuys, Calif.
(there really is a Van Nuys), came up with  &UR; shapesuit &LR; , which it
also called a  &UR; Secret Hug &LR; . (It was not to be confused with a
 &UR; panty girdle &LR; , which has legs.)  &UR; Shaping &LR;  in this context has a
history; it was first used in 1564 in an English archdeaconry:
``His  &UR; shappinge apparell &LR;  was a yowlowe sattanne dublet and a
payre of housse.``
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bodyslimmers &LR; , with the ``emancipating  &UR; Hipslip &LR; ,'' are
trademarks of Nancy Ganz, who is not only creative in the naming of
her products but would _ long ago _ be hailed as ``the Girdle
Queen.'' More recently, she would be considered a leader in the
field of  &UR; intimate apparel &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   But as we all know, things formerly intimate have been outed,
and intimacy has become outimacy. That is why we refer to Ganz, and
to legions dedicated to helping men and women tuck it in and
tighten it up, as  &UR; shapewear &LR;  executives.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Jack Jackson can't remember the last time he wrote a check and
hasn't spoken face to face with a bank teller in years. Jackson has
handled his personal banking online with Bank Boston since 1989,
and he expanded to online banking for his public relations business
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although he experienced two instances of bank errors that cost
him several hours on the phone with customer service, that has not
deterred him from banking online. ``I think I've had to deal with
the best and worst that it has to offer,'' Jackson said. ``It's
easy to set up and it can be incredibly convenient, but anyone who
has really bad financial habits may find that their problems will
be exacerbated when they go online. It's definitely not for
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   One big difference with many online banking accounts is that as
soon as you direct the bank to send out a payment from your
account, that money's gone. You can't mail out a $50 check and
figure that you can get to the bank to deposit the money to cover
the check before it's presented by the recipient's bank for
payment. But one thing online customers gain is convenience _ the
bank's always open for business.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Jackson was unusual. Although some of the
largest banks in the country, including Wells Fargo, Citibank and
Chase Manhattan, have offered their customers online bill-payment
options for nearly a decade, only during the last couple of years
have customers really started to warm to the idea of clicking on
the Send button at an online banking site.
</P>
<P>
   According to IDC, a market research firm in Framingham, Mass.,
the number of people in the United States participating in at least
one online banking function (like viewing deposits, transferring
money between accounts and paying bills) rose to 12.4 million in
1999 from 1.4 million in 1996. IDC expects that number to rise to
18.7 million by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts cite the widespread availability of
modem-equipped computers as one reason for the increase in online
banking activity. They add that people are also finally starting to
get comfortable with the notion that entering bank account
information online is no riskier than giving a credit card number
over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Online trading has really made people aware of how to bank
online,'' said Mitch Caplan, president of Telebank, a phone- and
Internet-based bank. ``The security issues aren't really there any
more.'' But while online trading offers discount services, many
banks charge more for online accounts.
</P>
<P>
   It has become much more convenient to pay bills and transfer
money to other accounts via computer because many banks are moving
their entire online consumer banking areas onto the Internet and
off private networks, which required the customer to use
communications software and a modem to dial directly into a
company's computer system.
</P>
<P>
   To pay bills online with Chase in 1994, for example, a customer
had to call Chase's customer service and order software disks for
logging onto a private network. Since Chase moved its online
banking functions to the Internet last February, online customers
have been able to gain access to their accounts from any PC with an
Internet connection by going to the bank's Web site and punching in
an identifying name and password.
</P>
<P>
   So what should you expect if you wean yourself from your
checkbook? Setting up access to your bank account via the Internet
is relatively simple. After securing your bank accounts with a
customer ID and a password, you enter the account numbers and
addresses of each company or person you pay regularly. As long as
you can provide that information, you can send payments to large
companies (like your cable and credit card companies) as well as to
individuals, like your piano teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Some banks charge a monthly fee, usually $5 to $15, for
unlimited bill payments, but many are providing Internet banking
access and bill payments at no extra charge.
</P>
<P>
   The convenience of online banking has won some fans, like Lisa
and Alex Giassa of Teaneck, N.J., who have had an online account
since August 1998. ``It's definitely a convenience thing for us,''
Ms. Giassa said. ``If I know I have a bill due in a few days, I can
go upstairs, pay it in a couple of minutes and not deal with any
envelopes.''
</P>
<P>
   But lest you think that the click of a Send button will
instantaneously send off your son's college tuition payment on the
day it is due, think again. Only about half of electronic payments
are actually transmitted to recipients electronically. Many utility
companies and merchants are not set up to receive electronic
payments. Such companies are sent checks via regular mail _ an
annoying lesson for those who don't make allowances for the delayed
delivery and miss payment deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   And that delay brings up the question of the ``float'' and why
there's more of a float in electronic banking. In banking terms, a
float is the period between the time you issue a check and the time
it becomes available to the recipient. If you issue a check to an
out-of-state recipient, the money will not be credited to the
account of that company or person for up to five business days
after the check gets to the recipient's bank. A recipient in the
same state gets access to the money in up to three business days
after it is deposited, while someone with an account at the same
bank will get the money within one business day.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a regular checking account and issue a check, the
money won't be deducted until it is presented to your bank by the
recipient's bank for payment. But for many electronic accounts, the
bank automatically debits your online account soon after you hit
the button to instruct the bank to issue a check out of your
account.
</P>
<P>
   ``The float is a big psychological issue for a lot of people,''
said Jim Bruene, editor of Online Banking Report, an industry
newsletter. ``The tighter someone's funds are, the more he or she
relies on it. None of this is very meaningful when you're making 2
percent interest on cash balances.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that some organization _ sometimes a bank, sometimes a
check-processing company _ is able to hang onto your money for the
length of the float means that it can make money off your money, in
very short-term investments.
</P>
<P>
   Even though a payment is taken out of an online account right
away, that doesn't necessarily mean that the recipient of the money
is paid quickly. For example, Philip Goodman, a film and video
producer in Manhattan, paid a friend $25 out of his Chase Online
checking account. His checking account was debited quickly, but the
money did not show up in the recipient's account for three days,
Goodman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say it's electronic, but it's not,'' he complained.
``They debit your account and then send a check. I can send a
check!''
</P>
<P>
   Most online banks use third-party check consolidators like
Checkfree to process the checks from online accounts, send them
along and disburse the money. In those cases, the bank pays
Checkfree the amount of the check, and Checkfree pays the company
or person receiving the check.
</P>
<P>
   If the check recipient is set up to receive payments
electronically, through a process known as electronic transfer, the
payments move through an automated clearing-house system within 24
hours, said Matthew Lewis, a senior vice president at Checkfree.
</P>
<P>
   But if the recipient is not set up to receive payments
electronically, Checkfree mails a check to the recipient's bank,
where it is processed in a transaction that can take up to five
business days if the payment crosses state lines.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve is not sure about online banking's effect on
the float. ``We've tried to do what we can to manage float, but
whatever happens with the electronic technology is still an unknown
at this point,'' said Doug Tillet, a spokesman for the New York
Federal Reserve Bank.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Knowing that money is paid out of an account right away can help
online customers if they want to make last-minute electronic
payments, he added. If the recipient of a payment is set up to
receive electronic transfers, most online banking customers can
issue a payment at, say, 4:59 p.m. on the day the payment is due
and won't have to allow for mail delivery times.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bank Rate Monitor, an online service that tracks
interest rates for credit cards and personal loans offered by major
banks, at least 215 of the 350 largest Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp.-insured banks in the country offer the ability to pay bills
electronically. But bill consolidators like Checkfree are also
providing electronic payment services to nontraditional banks on
the Internet, which means your choice of where on the Internet to
pay your bills is becoming a lot broader. Internet-only banks can
be a good choice for people who keep a lot of money in their
checking accounts because they generally pay higher interest, but
they also tend to charge higher fees for automated teller machines.
</P>
<P>
   Personal and business financial software like Quicken and
Microsoft Money offer an electronic bill-paying option via
Checkfree. Customers can also use such software, which gives a user
an overall financial picture, with many types of online accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to bill payments, Checkfree and other consolidators,
like Transpoint and Cybercash, are also working with banks and
other financial sites to bring your bills and account information
to you online.
</P>
<P>
   With its E-card, First U.S.A., a leading credit card issuer,
offers customers online access to detailed information about their
credit card purchases as well as the ability to pay their bills
online. Many banks are finding ways to let customers see their
bills online as a way of offering better service than the
nontraditional banking competitors who are zeroing in on their
business.
</P>
<P>
   A type of bill-presentment service was recently announced by
Chase Manhattan Bank, First Union and Wells Fargo; they are forming
a new company that will enable people and businesses to both
receive and pay bills electronically. The company, called the
Exchange, will serve as an electronic hub that will allow companies
issuing bills to reach consumers through their financial
institutions. Consumers will be able to log on to their online
banking site and view lists of their outstanding bills, said Sharon
Osberg, executive vice president for financial services at Wells
Fargo.
</P>
<P>
   The three banks will have a customer base of 60 million and
almost 60,000 corporations, said Wendy Grover, a spokeswoman for
Wells Fargo. Ms. Osberg added that by the time the Exchange is
fully up and running next year, all electronic payments will be
settled on the day they are issued, effectively eliminating any
float.
</P>
<P>
   But whether an electronic overdue notice will be easier to
ignore than a piece of paper that says ``account past due'' in red
letters on it remains to be seen.

POLICE MAY LOSE CONTROL OF LICENSING MASSAGE PARLORS 
</HEADLINE>

 By ULYSSES TORASSA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Fingerprinting, skills testing and restrictions
on prostitution arrests appear to be going by the wayside at San
Francisco's massage parlors.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Commission on Tuesday put its stamp of approval on
the idea of transferring the responsibility for licensing massage
parlors, out-call massage services and individual massage
therapists from the Police Department to the public Health
Department. The measure is before the Board of Supervisors, which
is expected to hold hearings on the matter later this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, it would eliminate the requirement that
people applying for a permit to practice massage disclose all
criminal convictions. As it stands, the Police Department turns
down applicants who had a prostitution-related conviction in the
past five years.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to move the focus of massage regulation from the
criminal realm to that of health, said Jeff Klausner, director of
sexually transmitted disease services for the Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key for us is that we'll be able to focus on the health
and environmental safety of the massage parlors and workers and
allow them to enjoy a safer working environment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in the proposed change would hinder the police from
enforcing narcotics, prostitution and other laws at massage
parlors, Klausner said.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Department expects to come up with more detailed
rules governing massage establishments and practitioners after the
legislation passes. Among the challenges will be finding a way to
address the needs of massage therapists _ a growing field aimed at
health and stress-reduction, and the old-style sex-for-hire
masseuses.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting regulations could end up reinstating some of the
current requirements, such as fingerprinting or a written test,
Klausner said. They could also end up being tougher than what is
currently on the books.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation being considered would continue to require
people applying for permits provide proof of age and a diploma from
a massage program or school of massage. However, there have been
complaints of diploma mills that sell unqualified people
certificates in order for them to meet the requirements.
</P>
<P>
   As it stands, there are 81 massage establishments and 80 massage
call services licensed in San Francisco. About 700 individuals have
city permits to practice.
</P>
<P>
   V. Roy Lefcourt, a lawyer representing 13 massage parlors, said
the legislation is long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been troubling to me that there is no expertise in
the Police Department for running or being in charge of the massage
industry,'' he said. ``It's a very chilling situation, where you
feel like you must be doing something wrong if you have to check in
with the Police Department.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the department is acknowledging that sex-for-hire is
going on at many establishments, which is why the Health
Department's sexually transmitted diseases branch will be heavily
involved if the legislation passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is general community awareness that this is a common
activity,'' Klausner said. ``We are interested in applying the
concept of harm reduction _ trying to educate and inform
individuals to practice behavior that may result in less
transmission of STDs.''

YOU'VE GOT MAIL: HELLO MUDDAH (AND CC: FADDAH)

<TEXT>
<P>
   They are not quite jumping through hoops, but camp counselors
have to be pretty creative to get their campers to write home
during the summer. On certain nights at some camps, getting a seat
in the dining hall is contingent upon presentation of a letter,
addressed and stamped. Contests in which letters are drawn from a
hat, with the winning writer getting a free trip to the canteen,
are also common. ``We try for three letters a week per camper, with
some success,'' said Howard Salzberg, director of Camp Modin, in
Belgrade, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   For the busy camper, e-mail seems to be a natural answer,
helping to ease the cumbersome task of letter writing. But most
camps, keep e-mail largely out of the experience, either because
they do not have enough computers, or for more philosophical
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being at camp is about being away, and being independent,''
Salzberg said. ``When you have e-mail readily accessible, it's like
you're not really away from home.''
</P>
<P>
   Camp Modin, like many camps, allows parents to send a limited
number of faxes and e-mails, which staff members print out, fold,
and distribute daily along with regular mail. But campers must
still send their mail via the Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   Salzberg added that as a result of the deluge of faxes and
e-mails coming into the camp from parents last summer, he's had to
establish a limit of two faxes or e-mails per family per week this
summer. ``We had some parents e-mailing their kids stock quotes,
and entire sports sections,'' he said. ``It completely overloaded
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Many parents would like their children to be allowed to send
e-mail. ``It would enable them to send letters off quickly and
often, which is not the case now, because they have trouble keeping
track of stamps and envelopes,'' said Joanna Bronfman, of
Chappaqua, N.Y., who has two sons heading to Modin this summer. ``I
don't care how I hear from them, as long as I can hear from them
often. They can skywrite, for all I care.''
</P>
<P>
   Several companies, including E-Camp, based in New York City, are
attempting to tap campers into e-mail without burdening the camps.
The company installs computers at camps _ one for each 25 children
whose parents agree to pay $5 per month that their child is at
camp. The campers then get unlimited e-mail. E-camp said it has
agreements with 30 camps, including Kinder Ring in Hopewell
Junction, N.Y., and Timber Ridge in High View, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Jacobs, executive director of Timber Lake Camp in Shandaken,
N.Y., said he considered using the service, but despite the fact
that it would not have cost the camp anything, he ultimately
decided he didn't have the space _ or the desire. ``We want camp to
be a little bit of life as it was,'' he said. ``We don't feel like
we have to move ahead with every aspect of technology. Don't kids
get enough of that all winter?''
</P>
<P>
   Some camps, like Buck's Rock, in New Milford, Conn., and Camp
Frenchwoods, in Hancock, N.Y., offer computer programming classes
and make their computers available for sending e-mail during
designated times.
</P>
<P>
   Camp Frenchwoods, which has 400 campers, has set up 40 computer
workstations for the summer, 20 of which will be online. ``We find
e-mail is a better alternative to the phone, especially for a
first-time camper,'' said Ron Schaefer, the camp's director. ``If a
camper has a fight with a friend, didn't like a particular meal, or
struck out with the bases loaded, writing it down helps them put it
into perspective. Even with the immediacy of e-mail, it gives them
assurance without hearing their mother's voice over the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Many camps now recognize that Web sites can be useful for
providing parents with updates on their child's activities. As
busses rolled into Camp Echo Lake, in Warrensburg, N.Y., last
summer, a counselor stood beside each bus snapping pictures of the
arriving campers with a digital camera. The images were then posted
on the Echo Lake Web site, alongside information about what time
each bus arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Internet services such as KidsCamps, based in Boca Raton, Fla.,
now offer Web sites for thousands of camps. Nancy Diamond,
co-founder of Kids Camps, said many of the camps that use the
company's services also set up ``parent guest books'' to publish
weekly or monthly newsletters, in addition to photos of the
campers, and other information.
</P>
<P>
   Echo Lake, like other camps, now lets campers design their own
Web pages, which parents can log onto with a password to see photos
of their children water-skiing, at dinner, or with their bunkmates.
If a camper was in a play or a relay race, the parents can download
snippets of audio or video of the performance. Echo Lake has had to
hire a full-time employee just to maintain Web activity, but Stein
said it's a worthy investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're applying technology in a way that gives the kids their
independence, and still lets the parents feel connected,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Human anatomy is a subject that can veer in an instant from
thrilling and chilling to dry as dust.
</P>
<P>
   During the Renaissance, public dissections provided all the
recreational titillation that we get from gory movies and roller
coasters today. In Italy, prominent people, often masked and
dressed in costume, crowded into dissection amphitheaters during
carnival time. Servants passed out flowers, oranges and sticks of
incense to dispel the noxious odors of the proceedings. Two smoking
torches illuminated the dissection table, where the professor of
anatomy, robed in red, pointed out structures of interest with a
long, tapered rod.
</P>
<P>
   Although the demonstrations were intended to provoke a mood of
solemn moral reflection, audiences tended to become a little giddy,
particularly when female anatomy was displayed. In Holland, the
medical historian Frank Gonzalez-Crussi wrote in ``Suspended
Animation'' (Harcourt Brace, 1995), laws actually had to be passed
``to check the inappropriate outbursts of persons who laughed,
clapped, asked indecent questions, grabbed the specimens prepared
by the dissector, or otherwise attempted to disrupt the solemnity
of the occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   For anatomy without a trace of pageantry or prurience, open a
copy of ``Gray's Anatomy,'' which has been periodically reissued in
all its incomparable turgor for the last century and a half.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire skeleton in the adult consists of 200 distinct
bones,'' begins Dr. Gray, and he proceeds to list them all,
followed by all the joints, and all the ligaments, muscles, nerves,
arteries and veins, totaling tens of thousands of structures, most
with long Latin names, their three-dimensional intricacy reduced to
enormous incomprehensible paragraphs with very few illustrations.
Medical students are reduced to tears by Dr. Gray and anatomists
like him who bled all the color and art from their subject and
demand rote memorization instead.
</P>
<P>
   Computers have provided the opportunity to combine the precision
of the classical texts with some of the three-dimensional thrills
and chills that kept those Renaissance audiences glued to their
benches.
</P>
<P>
   VISIBLE HUMAN CD MALE 2.0
</P>
<P>
   VISIBLE HUMAN CD FEMALE 1.1
</P>
<P>
   (Research Systems; $495 for both; Windows 3.1, 95 and 98, and
Mac.)
</P>
<P>
   Computers have had their most dramatic impact on the study of
anatomy in the National Library of Medicine's Visible Human
Project, based at the University of Colorado. The project plans to
create a complete, Internet-based electronic database of all the
organs in the human body as they appear in radiologic images and in
the flesh.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 two bodies were found for the project _ a 39-year-old
Texas man and a 59-year-old Maryland woman. Immediately after
death, both cadavers were scanned from head to toe with CAT
(computed axial tomography) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)
techniques. They were then frozen, encased in gelatin, infused with
latex and passed through the scientific equivalent of a rotary saw
calibrated to slice off paper-thin sections, which were
photographed digitally.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the Visible Human Project has spared us any
pictures of that process. Instead, two CD-ROM's representing the
project's major output to date contain vertical, horizontal and
transverse cross-sections of both bodies, as they would appear to
the naked eye and in CAT  &UR;  &LR; and MRI scans.
</P>
<P>
   No mere book could ever render anatomical structures with the
extraordinary detail found in the images on these disks. Their
millimeter-by-millimeter overview of human anatomy could easily
replace entire shelves of standard anatomy and radiology atlases in
medical school libraries. An animation feature flips a set of
adjacent images like a child's flip book to make structural
relationships even clearer.
</P>
<P>
   If you have seen the MRI of that torn piece of cartilage in your
knee and are curious about what it used to look like, this disk
should be the place to find out. However, labeling is still a work
in progress. With about 70,000 labels, many of the man's structures
are identified, but there are many more to go, including the knee.
The woman is unlabeled and likely to remain so for the foreseeable
future, a company spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   For a surgeon or radiologist, access to this kind of precise
imaging of human bodies may be worth an outlay of $495 for both
disks. For others, idle curiosity about what it all looks like may
be satisfied at any of several Web sites where parts of the data
are displayed, including www.uchsc.edu/sm/chs/browse/browse.htm;
www.nlm.nih.gov/research/visible/visible human.html; or
www.visualman.com.

</P>
<P>
   This eerie tour of the human body is about as close as one is
likely to get these days to the atmosphere of a Renaissance
dissection. Like the Visible Human disks, it uses data from the
National Library of Medicine's Visible Man project, but it plays to
the medical laity rather than the professional audience, with an
emphasis on the more sensational aspects of the project.
</P>
<P>
   No longer is the visible man's anonymity protected in standard
scientific fashion. The disk enthusiastically tells us all about
him: He was a Texan named Joseph Paul Jernigan, who murdered a
75-year old man during a robbery and was sentenced to death. Before
his execution, Jernigan willed his body to science. Many years of
body-building on Death Row had left his muscles defined to
near-perfection, an anatomist's dream.

   A computer artist selectively reconstructed the digital images
of Jernigan's body for this disk into colorized cross-sections and
airy three-dimensional renderings. The viewer can twirl the entire
skeleton on its axis, peel off layers of skin and muscle to reveal
the organs underneath and pan along the various planes of the body
as if the viewer were in a tiny helicopter traveling over, under
and through the body's terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Just knowing the identity of the face and body dancing and
weaving on the screen here can give the viewer a creepy feeling;
the enclosed biography of Jernigan, which supplies details like his
last meal, increases the effect. The background colors of black and
deep red both intensify the atmosphere and make it a bit difficult
to discern the details in many images unless the disk is viewed in
a dark room. If you do that, all you need are a few smoking torches
to be right back in the 16th century.
</P>
<P>
   Body Voyage is not the place to learn rigorous anatomy.
Structures are labeled but not very systematically, and some labels
are omitted; the hand and wrist, for example, are not part of this
voyage.
</P>
<P>
   And if you are curious about the whereabouts of the appendix,
you will not find one here: Jernigan had his removed.
</P>
<P>
   A few dozen short essays on anatomical subjects ranging from
headaches to hip replacements are like the articles in an in-flight
magazine _ amusing but lightweight compared with the all-too-real
vistas unfolding in the background.
</P>
<P>
   BODYWORKS
</P>
<P>
   (Learning Company; $39.95; Windows 95 and 98.)
</P>
<P>
   Here is an anatomy class as modern and sterile as an elementary
school hygiene lecture, complete with a large, unappetizing
disclaimer at the outset deflecting all questions aboutactual
health conditions back to the viewer's own doctor.
</P>
<P>
   On Bodyworks, a standard Windows-based format calls up a
complete set of colorful, computer-generated three-dimensional
models of human organs that can be rotated and magnified, along
with short descriptions of each organ's structure and function and
a disembodied voice that pronounces each name.
</P>
<P>
   The disk also includes discussion of how the organs interact in
basic processes like eating, breathing and reproduction, and a few
words about health topics like nutrition, aging, hospice care and
even preferred-provider organizations. An education section
introduces Dr. Bodywork, a pleasant-faced woman who, for unclear
reasons, is dressed like a cross between a bellhop and a military
police officer. With animated visual aids, she delivers short
lectures on such topics as sight, smell and touch.
</P>
<P>
   The targeted age range for this disk is hard to pinpoint. An
optional censorship function implies that younger children might be
confused by sexually explicit content, but most of the mannequins
have no genitalia, and one female figure is actually sporting a
large fig leaf. The reproductive organs are discussed in
straightforward fashion; sexual intercourse is not mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   But children are certainly going to be put off by the rampant
medical jargon, as in ``the abducens nerve is the sixth cranial
nerve and extends from the dorsal part of the pons to the lateral
rectus muscle of the eye.'' Although all possibly unfamiliar words
are in hypertext with definitions quickly available, even adult
viewers without a medical vocabulary might balk at having to click
on almost every word in some sentences. Dr. Bodywork's lectures are
of a caliber that might be found in a medical school classroom.
</P>
<P>
   There are occasional interactive non sequiturs: clicking on
``scrapes and cuts,'' for instance, elicits a picture not of scabs
and bandages but of surgical suture techniques that might be used
to close a major abdominal operation. A sizable section on health
and beauty products (``shampoo is a product used to wash hair'') is
pure stuffing.

</P>
<P>
   The anatomy of the brain is the most difficult of any part of
the body to visualize, with complicated structures crumpled
together into a space the size of a cantaloupe. Neuroanatomists at
the University of Iowa have put together a set of detailed
photographs of sections of the human brain, with schematic drawings
that allow each structure to be identified. The result is the
equivalent of a very good textbook of brain anatomy.
</P>
<P>
   AMA SITE
</P>
<P>
   www.ama-assn.org/insight/genhlth/atlas/atlas.htm
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes detailed anatomical photographs are only distracting
when what you really need is a quick idea of what it means when
you're told that a relative's stroke may have damaged Wernicke's
area of the brain. This site, sponsored by the American Medical
Association, provides brief explanations of how organs work.

COMPLAINT SERVICES FOR HIRE ON THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: byline with 8 as middle initial is cq.) (DW) 
 By JENNIFER 8 LEE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Given the service economy's hire-someone-else mentality, which
leads some people to pay others to walk the dog and tutor the
children in baseball, it is no wonder that you can now hire
Internet businesses to complain on your behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Sites like Complain.com and Fight Back promise to write letters,
make phone calls and, if necessary, whine in exchange for a modest
_ and sometimes not so modest _ fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have tried to handle problems themselves, but
they're frustrated and angry,'' said Bill Tran, president of Caveat
Emptor (www.cemptor.com), which went on line in March. ``They want
to forget about it,'' Tran said. ``That's when I jump in.''
</P>
<P>
   One angry America Online customer, Elizabeth Huntington of
Bradenton, Fla., failed to get an erroneous AOL charge canceled
after three discussions with customer representatives over four
weeks. ``I don't think that business, especially AOL, takes me
seriously,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She turned up Caveat Emptor (www.cemptor.com) by searching for
``complaint'' on the Web. A week after Caveat Emptor sent a letter,
AOL returned $48 to Ms. Huntington, along with a refund for a $50
bank overdraft fee. ``When they got the letter from me through
Caveat, then they took me seriously,'' Miss Huntington said. She
wouldn't have got her money back without Caveat Emptor, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Companies and clients say their specialized services are more
effective than the efforts of a consumer working alone. ``The
reason the average person can't do this is that the average person
does not have the kind of resources that we have,'' said David
Horowitz, a consumer advocate who writes a ``Fight Back''
syndicated newspaper column and has a Web site at
www.fightback.com.
</P>
<P>
   With Americans buying and spending more than ever, the
inevitable result is more services, products and goods to complain
about. In addition, customer satisfaction with technology products
may be declining in the face of rising product quality, creating a
rich customer base for the professional complainers.
</P>
<P>
   Some Web enterprises will complain for clients on a budget. The
Consumer Complaint Resolution Company
(www.complaintresolution &QC; .com) bills $29.95, or a 20 percent
commission on the amount recovered. Fight Back will send out a
letter personally signed by Horowitz for $25, a flat fee the
company said covered administrative costs. Complain.com
(www.complain.com) pleads a case for only $19.95. Caveat Emptor
writes free complaint letters (but may start charging someday).
</P>
<P>
   A number of these sites, like Fight Back and Caveat Emptor, also
have complaint bulletin boards for posting complaints publicly. The
goal is to give companies and agencies an incentive to shape up.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new way of handling it, where you can use the power
of the Internet and the power of mass public exposure to resolve
people's problems,'' Horowitz said. ``And so far, it works.''
</P>
<P>
   Specialized expertise can carry a hefty price tag. Gary and
Sandy Rattigan of Somerville, Mass., started Complain to Us in 1997
(www.complaintous.com). They charge $50 per hour (and a 30 percent
commission when larger sums are recovered). They say they have an
overall success rate of about 80 percent. Ellen Phillips of
Alexandria, Va., gave up teaching English in middle school last
year to turn all her attention to her business, Ellen's Poison Pen
(www.ellenspoisonpen.com). She recently raised her rates to $30 per
100 words and $65 per hour. Clients spend an average of $400 for
her services.
</P>
<P>
   An Ellen's Poison Pen customer, Jamie Urick of Frankfort, Ill.,
explained, ``If you have leg pain and you go to a physical
therapist, you go to an expert _ it's the same thing.'' Mrs. Urick
and her neighbors were frustrated that repeated pleas to state and
county officials had resulted in no action against a noisy dirt
bike track. Mrs. Phillips composed a biting letter whose recipients
ranged from the county sheriff to the governor of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff replied immediately. Even though the case cost the
complainers $240 and may still end up in court, the residents said
the sharp, professional tone of the letter was worth it.

<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're looking for investment ideas, consider picking the
brains of the best in the business.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you would like to chat with John Bogle, the founder of the
Vanguard Group, the second-largest mutual fund in the world; or
Mary Zweig, chairman of a $9 billion mutual fund bearing his name;
or maybe Mario Gabelli, chairman of a $10 billion mutual fund
bearing his name. Foster Friess, manager and owner of the
Brandywine Fund, the best-performing no-loan mutual fund, may also
have a few ideas for you.
</P>
<P>
   For a different point of view, you may want to talk to some of
the information specialists in investing, say, Louis Navallier, who
edits the MPT Review, a highly rated investment newsletter, or
William O'Neil, founder of Investor's Business Daily. Don Phillips,
who heads Morningstar, the leading firm for rating and tracking
mutual funds, also has his own take on the whole business.
</P>
<P>
   Round that out with a talk with Harry Markowitz, Nobel Prize
winner for developing the Modern Portfolio Theory, and you would
consider yourself well-educated in the investment business.
</P>
<P>
   Or you would have a book.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Kenneth A. Stern thought when he interviewed all of
those people for his new book ``Secrets of the Investment
All-Stars'' (Amacom, 301 pages, $25).
</P>
<P>
   The book brings you the investment insight of nine of the top
investors/market information specialists in the country. Each
brings a unique perspective to the complex world of investing.
</P>
<P>
   A simple question-and-answer format brings the reader into the
room where Stern is interviewing the investment stars, making the
book easy to breeze through.
</P>
<P>
   And the information is specific enough to be useful, yet doesn't
get bogged down in mind-numbing number-crunching and graphs. ``Each
all-star has very distinct and different views from that of their
peers,'' Stern writes. ``This is revealing in many ways. Most
importantly, it confirms to an investor that there is more than one
way to skin a cat, and more than one way to make money at
investing. It also provides a whole array of different styles and
disciplines for you to greedily absorb.''
</P>
<P>
   Take Zweig, for example. He has been named by Forbes, among
others, as a legend in market forecasting. Stern says he is
meticulous in his constant analysis of the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``To forecast the market, Zweig has probably probed, measured,
monitored ... and created more forecasting models than anyone you
will ever meet,'' Stern writes. ``Zweig would say that forecasting
the market is not so much about understanding money as it is about
creating a model, about finding a trend and sticking to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Zweig has 70 different factors in his market model, Stern
writes. The most important ones are monetary indicators, (mostly
interest rates); sentiment indicators (flows into mutual funds);
and momentum indicators (price and volume of stocks).
</P>
<P>
   Gabelli looks at the stock market in a totally different light,
Stern writes.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than changing his model to keep up with Wall Street's
trends, Gabelli makes his decisions based on something called value
investing, a strategy of picking bargain stocks that have not yet
reached their future value.
</P>
<P>
   But Gabelli adds a kicker that he calls a catalyst. An
undervalued company will likely stay there, he believes, but if an
active ingredient, an event of some type is triggered, the stock
will rise to its true value. The catalyst can be anything from the
death of the founder to regulatory changes, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Such interesting thoughts are throughout this well-presented
book. Stern ends it with a 20-point checklist, summing up how to
use ``the best of the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Investing can be a lot of hard work. Stern shows us how it can
be intriguing and fun as well.

   ``High-Tech Careers for Low-Tech People''
</P>
<P>
   By William A. Schaffer
</P>
<P>
   Ten Speed Press, $14.95
</P>
<P>
   Communication is the most important skill required by the
high-tech industry, author William Schaffer found when talking to
people in the industry about his premise that people with degrees
in the arts can find a home in the high-tech world. Schaffer is an
example of this idea. He holds a degree in government and French
literature from Columbia, but works as an international business
development manager for Sun Microsystems. Schaffer offers a career
option many people may not realize they have and shows them how to
pursue it in this book.

</P>
<P>
   Real estate agent and author Ralph Roberts _ he says he
generates 600 sales a year, almost a hundred times that of the
average agent _ creates a sales teaching program based on a
yearlong weekly seminar he created for his Detroit company. The
author of ``Walk Like a Giant, Sell Like a Madman,'' Roberts
discusses the many tricks of the trade of selling in his latest
book. Ideas on customer retention, time management and getting out
of a slump are included.

   ``Business the Rupert Murdoch Way: Ten Secrets of the World's
Greatest Deal-Maker''
</P>
<P>
   By Stuart Crainer
</P>
<P>
   Amacom, $14.95
</P>
<P>
   This book is one of a series of four highlighting the business
practices of Murdoch, Bill Gates, Richard Branson and Jack Welch.
All are well-written by English business author Stuart Crainer, who
has also written such bestsellers as ``The Ultimate Business
Library.'' Crainer has done his homework on these business moguls
and offers not only a detailed background on them, but also an
insight into their business practices.

 FINDING the AMERICAN DREAM ... IN A MOTEL  
 &HT;     (This article has already moved to Centerpiece clients. To
publish as a ``separate buy'' article, it must be purchased _ the
rate is not prohibitive _ from one of these New York Times
Syndicate sales representatives: 
 &HT;    (--U.S. and Canada: DEBRA WEYDERT in New Jersey at
1-732-390-4480; fax, 732-390-4697. 
 &HT;    (--Europe and Asia: KARL HORWITZ in Paris at 47-42-17-11; fax,

 &HT;    (--Latin America: OLIVIA VASQUEZ in Los Angeles, 310-996-0075;
fax, 310-996-0089.  By TUNKU VARADARAJAN  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    ``You're getting the last room in Huntsville,'' the man at the
front desk rasped.
 &HT;    I was in the heart of a certain kind of Texas _ the kind I'd
probably only visit in pursuit of a story _ and the room was a
godsend. I thanked the man and we shook hands _ not a gesture you
often see enacted between owner and customer at the front desk of
an Econo Lodge. But he was Indian and so am I, and it was our
little way of touching base.
 &HT;    This was two years ago. As I was then new to America, I asked
him bluntly what on earth had brought him to a place like
Huntsville. My naked curiosity amused him.
 &HT;    ``Why shouldn't I be here?'' he said. Indians like him were
everywhere, especially in places like Huntsville. Go 15 miles west
and you'd find a motel run by his cousin. Ninety miles south and
there was another cousin in another motel. An uncle had a place,
too, somewhere in Georgia.
 &HT;    Wherever there was a motel in the United States, he said _ and I
mistook this assertion for hyperbole _ there were likely to be
people from India running it. The statement, I learned later, was
not all that far from the truth.
 &HT;    America's motels constitute what could be called a nonlinear
ethnic niche: A certain ethnic group becomes entrenched in a
clearly identifiable economic sector, working at jobs for which it
has no evident cultural, geographical or even racial affinity.
 &HT;    I don't mean Italians owning pizzerias, or Japanese people
running judo schools. I mean, to use an obvious example, the Korean
dominance of the deli-and-grocery sector in New York _ a city where
the Chinese run most laundries and Sri Lankans, in case you didn't
know this, run most porn-video stores. Or the Arabs in greater
Detroit, who have a stranglehold on gas stations, or the Vietnamese
who monopolize nail salons in Los Angeles.
 &HT;    Farther afield, I could mention London's taxi drivers,
sharp-tongued in their big black cars, many of whom are Jews from
the city's East End; or the security guards outside New Delhi's
more affluent residences, virtually all of whom are Nepalese; or
the prostitutes in the United Arab Emirates, who are so often women
from Russia.
 &HT;    According to the latest figures from the Asian American Hotel
Owners Association (AAHOA), slightly more than 50 percent of all
motels in the United States are now owned by people of Indian
origin. Pull off any Interstate highway and look for a cheap bed
for the night and there is a better-than-even chance that the motel
you will curl up in belongs to Indians. (Looking at the broader
spectrum of all hotels of any sort in the United States - from
trendy boutique hotels in Manhattan to mom-and-pop outfits in the
boondocks _ almost 37 percent are owned by Indians.)
 &HT;    If you bear in mind that Indians constitute less than 1 percent
of America's population, the conquest of this economic niche
appears extraordinary.
 &HT;    Look a bit closer and the picture is even more arresting: about
70 percent of all Indian motel owners _ or a third of all motel
owners in America _ are called Patel, a surname that indicates they
are members of a Gujarati Hindu subcaste.
 &HT;    ``There's a thing our parents tell everyone, so don't yawn if
you've heard it already,'' says Mit Amin, an urbane 39-year-old who
owns the Beverly Hills Inn, a chic bed-and-breakfast in the
Buckhead section of Atlanta. ``In some American small towns they
think 'Patel' is an Indian word for 'motel.' Can you blame them? As
for me, I'm glad I'm called Amin. Wouldn't you want to be called
Brown if the rest of the world was called Smith?''
 &HT;    Patels and Amins, however, are not as far apart as Smiths and
Browns might be. They share the same slot in the elaborate Indian
caste structure, with its four principal castes and myriad
subcastes: They are both vaishyas, or traders, who were once
employed to calculate the tithes that were owed to medieval kings
by farmers in Gujarat, an Indian state on the Arabian Sea, where
their origins lie. Most Indians believe that these people have
commerce in their blood. And the Patels themselves seem to believe
it too.
 &HT;    ``Patels are maybe the shrewdest businesspeople in the world,''
chuckled Lata Patel, who with her husband, Pankaj (``Call me
P.J.''), runs the Budget Inn in Jasper, Ga., a mountain town of
some 3,000 mostly white inhabitants about an hour's drive from
Atlanta.
 &HT;    Lata, 44, is winsome and lively; when dressed in a formal silk
sari she must surely be the most glamorous woman in Jasper. Theirs
is a plain little motel, built in the local architectural
vernacular, with a gently sloping gray slate roof, a facade of
muted pink and a well-tended grass verge. At the time of my
midmorning visit, Lata was in slacks and a shirt, addressing a
female client as ``honey'' and buzzing about the front desk with
instructions for a dozy young cleaner.
 &HT;    This modest motel is where Lata and P.J. say they've found their
``American dream'' _ a phrase they used often, and
unselfconsciously. But why? Why did they, and thousands of other
Patels in America, seek their fortune in the lodging niche? Why not
hardware stores, pet shops, drugstores?
 &HT;    Hasmukh P. Rama, 51, is the chairman of the American Hotel and
Motel Association, the trade group representing America's $85.6
billion lodging industry. Rama is tiny, only 5 feet 3 inches tall,
and his pate is as smooth as a brand-new cricket ball. His surname
used to be Patel, but the family decided to adopt a new one
``because Patel, as you can see, is a very common name.''
 &HT;    He is the first Asian to head the 89-year-old organization, and
at a recent Indian hoteliers' convention in Atlanta he worked the
room like a politician at a rally. Rama seemed like the man who
could explain the motel-Patel phenomenon. But his answers to my
questions, it turned out, seemed more calculated to promote a
certain myth that successful hotel-owning Indians have begun to
spin for public consumption.
 &HT;    ``You must know the ancient Sanskrit phrase, `Atithi devo bhava'
_ 'The guest is God.' Hospitality is in our culture,'' he told me.
``It comes naturally to us. It is inherent in the nature of the
Indian. It is natural for us to be in the lodging sector.''
 &HT;    If that is so, I asked, how was it that hardly any of these
people ran hotels before they came to America?
 &HT;    ``It's all about opportunity and example,'' Rama replied sagely,
starting into a speech about hard work. He related how he arrived
in America in 1969 and noticed how ``our people'' were buying
motels; by 1973, he had bought one.
 &HT;    Now his company, JHM Enterprises, operates 23 hotels in six
states and one in India. Last year, his family created the Rama
Scholarship Fund for the American Dream, with a donation of
$1,000,001. (Hindus consider gifts of money ending in the numeral 1
to be especially auspicious.) The benefaction is intended to help
students from minorities go to schools for hotel management.
 &HT;    It's an inspiring tale, and Rama seems to want me to multiply it
by many thousands to explain the Indian dominance of the motel
business. But it isn't quite that simple.
 &HT;    ``If you look at an example of a domination of an economic niche
by an ethnic group,'' says Thomas Espenshade, a professor of
sociology at the Office of Population Research at Princeton
University, ``the general story is told in terms of the pioneers
and the followers. This is so whether you look at Indian motel
owners, Korean grocers, Chinese laundries.''
 &HT;    In this instance, the very earliest years are hazy. But the
first Indian motel owner in the United States is said to have been
an illegal immigrant named Kanjibhai Desai, who managed to buy the
Goldfield Hotel in downtown San Francisco in the early 1940s. By
the end of that decade, there was still only a handful of
Indian-owned motels, one of them owned by Bhulabhai Vanmalibhai
Patel _ whose grandson Pramod Patel is today a hotelier in the Bay
Area; his company's portfolio includes Holiday Inns, Ramadas and
Comfort Inns.
 &HT;    According to Pramod, his grandfather left his Gujarati village
in 1949, at the age of 29, for a better life in America. ``Only 100
Indians a year were allowed into the country in those days,''
Pramod says. ``My grandfather came, met Desai and decided to copy
him. So he leased the Auburn Hotel in downtown San Francisco that
same year.''
 &HT;    By the 1960s, Pramod estimates, there were still only 60 or 70
Indian-owned motels, mostly in California. Evolving immigration
laws helped the next wave of pioneers make their mark in the 1970s.
At the time, explains David Mumford, the president of Mumford Co.,
a hotel brokerage in Newport News, Va., ``many American motel
owners, people I call Mr. and Mrs. Jones, were aging. Motels were a
postwar thing, and by the mid-'70s a lot of the people who owned
them were of retiring age. Their kids were not interested in the
business.''
 &HT;    The concurrent global oil crisis meant people were taking fewer
driving vacations, which hurt the motel business. Property prices
were depressed. ``By the late 1970s and early 1980s, hundreds of
motels were up for sale,'' Mumford continues.
 &HT;    So why were these Indians attracted to them? I got a more
prosaic answer to that question from Vilpesh Patel, the owner of
the 85-room Flamingo Inn in Windsor, Conn. ``Technically, it's easy
to run. You don't need fluent English, just the will to work long
hours,'' he says. ``And it's a business that comes with a house _
you don't have to buy a separate house. Another important thing,''
he adds, ``is the cash flow. We like that.''
 &HT;    Vilpesh was a plain-speaker. True, the guest is God. But the
guest is also gold _ gold enough for Indian motel ownership to
spiral upward, year by year.
 &HT;    Buying a motel, even one that's in the red, usually requires a
substantial down payment, one beyond the reach of most new
immigrants. That, however, is one key to how this particular niche
was captured. The down payment was seldom a problem for a
prospective Indian purchaser, who was often able to turn to a
network of relatives and friends to help him out.
 &HT;    The story of Lata and P.J., for example, is not exactly the
hardscrabble tale associated with some immigrant groups. Following
an arranged marriage in 1976 in the Gujarati town of Nadiad, they
left for the United States, but not out of desperation or a lack of
options at home. They left behind enviable social status; their
families employed cooks, watchmen, sweepers, a chauffeur. P.J.'s
family owned a marble mine.
 &HT;    ``We had a comfortable life in India,'' he says. They simply
wanted independence _ freedom from the web of their extended
family, with its pressures to share and to conform _ and the simple
pleasure of living as a nuclear family.
 &HT;    In 1991, the Jasper motel's owner (also an Indian) offered P.J.
the place for $150,000; the couple cobbled together the $20,000
down payment from their own savings and loans from friends and
family. ``It was not hard for us to do.''
 &HT;    All of this is not to suggest that the road was an easy one. A
significant number of motel owners have come not directly from
India but from East Africa. The British brought thousands of
Indians to their colonies there in the last century to serve as
laborers and traders. They stayed on and flourished economically
after these colonies won their independence.
 &HT;    But the political and racial tensions of postcolonial Africa
made nomads of them yet again. About 70,000 were expelled from
Uganda by Gen. Idi Amin in 1972, and the majority resettled in
Britain. In time, many would move to the United States, joining an
unusual wave of well-educated Indian immigrants to this country
that had begun in the mid-1960s _ doctors, academics and
professionals _ and peaked in the late 1980s. By then, Indian
immigrants were predominantly nonprofessionals.
 &HT;    Vilpesh Patel's father, Jayantibhai, was one of those who had to
migrate against his will. He used to be a prosperous dry-goods
merchant in Lira, a town in central Uganda. In 1972, when
Jayantibhai was 32, Idi Amin ordered the confiscation of all Asian
property, stripping the owners of their Ugandan nationality.
 &HT;    After a few months in a refugee camp in Austria, where he was
separated from his wife and young children, Jayantibhai Patel ended
up working as a bus conductor in London. Things changed for the
family in 1989. Responding to the urgings of relatives, Jayantibhai
moved with his family to America. ``With some help from my
uncles,'' says his son Vilpesh, ``and with the money we had from
selling our house in London, Dad bought a motel.''
 &HT;    In the earlier days of the motel phenomenon, Indians tended
mostly to buy mom-and-pop establishments. ``They liked the
independence,'' Vilpesh Patel told me. ``We Patels, we Gujaratis,
we don't like working for other people.''
 &HT;    But there were other, less romantic factors keeping Indians out
of the franchise motel chains. According to Mit Amin, an
independent hotelier himself, ``The big brands didn't really want
us.''
 &HT;    Indeed, there was a time when Indians were the underdogs of the
lodging sector. Mike Patel, the industry-relations chairman of the
AAHOA, explains that some insurance companies thought Patels were
scam artists who bought, insured and burned down the property and
cashed in. He says that after a couple of fires in Tennessee in the
early 1980s, Indian moteliers had trouble getting insurance
coverage. The association was formed, he adds, ``in response to
that prejudice.'' It began with 160 members.
 &HT;    The first generation of Indian hotel owners, in a manner
consistent with many an emergent immigrant group, scrimped, went
without, darned old socks and never took a holiday. They did this
not merely to save money, but also because thrift is part of a
larger moral framework, one that regards all nonessential
expenditure as wasteful and unattractive.
 &HT;    It's an attitude buttressed by a puritanical aversion to frills
and frivolities, one that has its roots as much in the kind of
Hinduism that the Patels practice as in their historical tradition
as commercial perfectionists. You can hear it in Lata Patel's
description of the work that went into updating and improving her
property on the road to quadrupling its annual business.
 &HT;    Today, the AAHOA has 5,000 names on its rolls, plus seven
full-time staff members and an annual budget of $4.5 million. The
market value of properties owned by association members is $38
billion. They pay $725 million a year in property taxes and employ
800,000 people. ``The hotel establishment once didn't want to know
about us,'' chortles Amin. ``But now we are the establishment.''
 &HT;    That kind of success has, inevitably, bred resentment in some
quarters. In some parts of the rural South, white competitors have
been known to add a potent and less-than-subtle phrase to their
motel signs: ``American-Owned.''
 &HT;    Many of the Indian owners I spoke with acknowledge that they are
aware of such attitudes, but add pragmatically, as Mike Patel puts
it, they ''have learned to live with that sort of prejudice.''
 &HT;    ``It doesn't get us down,'' he insists. ``If we survived Idi
Amin, a couple of redneck motel owners aren't going to bother us
much. In any case, our motels are American-owned, too. We're
Patels, and Americans.''

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    ``You're getting the last room in Huntsville,'' the man at the
front desk rasped.
 &HT;    I was in the heart of a certain kind of Texas _ the kind I'd
probably only visit in pursuit of a story _ and the room was a
godsend. I thanked the man and we shook hands _ not a gesture you
often see enacted between owner and customer at the front desk of
an Econo Lodge. But he was Indian and so am I, and it was our
little way of touching base.
 &HT;    This was two years ago. As I was then new to America, I asked
him bluntly what on earth had brought him to a place like
Huntsville. My naked curiosity amused him.
 &HT;    ``Why shouldn't I be here?'' he said. Indians like him were
everywhere, especially in places like Huntsville. Go 15 miles west
and you'd find a motel run by his cousin. Ninety miles south and
there was another cousin in another motel. An uncle had a place,
too, somewhere in Georgia.
 &HT;    Wherever there was a motel in the United States, he said _ and I
mistook this assertion for hyperbole _ there were likely to be
people from India running it. The statement, I learned later, was
not all that far from the truth.
 &HT;    America's motels constitute what could be called a nonlinear
ethnic niche: A certain ethnic group becomes entrenched in a
clearly identifiable economic sector, working at jobs for which it
has no evident cultural, geographical or even racial affinity.
 &HT;    I don't mean Italians owning pizzerias, or Japanese people
running judo schools. I mean, to use an obvious example, the Korean
dominance of the deli-and-grocery sector in New York _ a city where
the Chinese run most laundries and Sri Lankans, in case you didn't
know this, run most porn-video stores. Or the Arabs in greater
Detroit, who have a stranglehold on gas stations, or the Vietnamese
who monopolize nail salons in Los Angeles.
 &HT;    Farther afield, I could mention London's taxi drivers,
sharp-tongued in their big black cars, many of whom are Jews from
the city's East End; or the security guards outside New Delhi's
more affluent residences, virtually all of whom are Nepalese; or
the prostitutes in the United Arab Emirates, who are so often women
from Russia.
 &HT;    According to the latest figures from the Asian American Hotel
Owners Association (AAHOA), slightly more than 50 percent of all
motels in the United States are now owned by people of Indian
origin. Pull off any Interstate highway and look for a cheap bed
for the night and there is a better-than-even chance that the motel
you will curl up in belongs to Indians. (Looking at the broader
spectrum of all hotels of any sort in the United States - from
trendy boutique hotels in Manhattan to mom-and-pop outfits in the
boondocks _ almost 37 percent are owned by Indians.)
 &HT;    If you bear in mind that Indians constitute less than 1 percent
of America's population, the conquest of this economic niche
appears extraordinary.
 &HT;    Look a bit closer and the picture is even more arresting: about
70 percent of all Indian motel owners _ or a third of all motel
owners in America _ are called Patel, a surname that indicates they
are members of a Gujarati Hindu subcaste.
 &HT;    ``There's a thing our parents tell everyone, so don't yawn if
you've heard it already,'' says Mit Amin, an urbane 39-year-old who
owns the Beverly Hills Inn, a chic bed-and-breakfast in the
Buckhead section of Atlanta. ``In some American small towns they
think 'Patel' is an Indian word for 'motel.' Can you blame them? As
for me, I'm glad I'm called Amin. Wouldn't you want to be called
Brown if the rest of the world was called Smith?''
 &HT;    Patels and Amins, however, are not as far apart as Smiths and
Browns might be. They share the same slot in the elaborate Indian
caste structure, with its four principal castes and myriad
subcastes: They are both vaishyas, or traders, who were once
employed to calculate the tithes that were owed to medieval kings
by farmers in Gujarat, an Indian state on the Arabian Sea, where
their origins lie. Most Indians believe that these people have
commerce in their blood. And the Patels themselves seem to believe
it too.
 &HT;    ``Patels are maybe the shrewdest businesspeople in the world,''
chuckled Lata Patel, who with her husband, Pankaj (``Call me
P.J.''), runs the Budget Inn in Jasper, Ga., a mountain town of
some 3,000 mostly white inhabitants about an hour's drive from
Atlanta.
 &HT;    Lata, 44, is winsome and lively; when dressed in a formal silk
sari she must surely be the most glamorous woman in Jasper. Theirs
is a plain little motel, built in the local architectural
vernacular, with a gently sloping gray slate roof, a facade of
muted pink and a well-tended grass verge. At the time of my
midmorning visit, Lata was in slacks and a shirt, addressing a
female client as ``honey'' and buzzing about the front desk with
instructions for a dozy young cleaner.
 &HT;    This modest motel is where Lata and P.J. say they've found their
``American dream'' _ a phrase they used often, and
unselfconsciously. But why? Why did they, and thousands of other
Patels in America, seek their fortune in the lodging niche? Why not
hardware stores, pet shops, drugstores?
 &HT;    Hasmukh P. Rama, 51, is the chairman of the American Hotel and
Motel Association, the trade group representing America's $85.6
billion lodging industry. Rama is tiny, only 5 feet 3 inches tall,
and his pate is as smooth as a brand-new cricket ball. His surname
used to be Patel, but the family decided to adopt a new one
``because Patel, as you can see, is a very common name.''
 &HT;    He is the first Asian to head the 89-year-old organization, and
at a recent Indian hoteliers' convention in Atlanta he worked the
room like a politician at a rally. Rama seemed like the man who
could explain the motel-Patel phenomenon. But his answers to my
questions, it turned out, seemed more calculated to promote a
certain myth that successful hotel-owning Indians have begun to
spin for public consumption.
 &HT;    ``You must know the ancient Sanskrit phrase, `Atithi devo bhava'
_ 'The guest is God.' Hospitality is in our culture,'' he told me.
``It comes naturally to us. It is inherent in the nature of the
Indian. It is natural for us to be in the lodging sector.''
 &HT;    If that is so, I asked, how was it that hardly any of these
people ran hotels before they came to America?
 &HT;    ``It's all about opportunity and example,'' Rama replied sagely,
starting into a speech about hard work. He related how he arrived
in America in 1969 and noticed how ``our people'' were buying
motels; by 1973, he had bought one.
 &HT;    Now his company, JHM Enterprises, operates 23 hotels in six
states and one in India. Last year, his family created the Rama
Scholarship Fund for the American Dream, with a donation of
$1,000,001. (Hindus consider gifts of money ending in the numeral 1
to be especially auspicious.) The benefaction is intended to help
students from minorities go to schools for hotel management.
 &HT;    It's an inspiring tale, and Rama seems to want me to multiply it
by many thousands to explain the Indian dominance of the motel
business. But it isn't quite that simple.
 &HT;    ``If you look at an example of a domination of an economic niche
by an ethnic group,'' says Thomas Espenshade, a professor of
sociology at the Office of Population Research at Princeton
University, ``the general story is told in terms of the pioneers
and the followers. This is so whether you look at Indian motel
owners, Korean grocers, Chinese laundries.''
 &HT;    In this instance, the very earliest years are hazy. But the
first Indian motel owner in the United States is said to have been
an illegal immigrant named Kanjibhai Desai, who managed to buy the
Goldfield Hotel in downtown San Francisco in the early 1940s. By
the end of that decade, there was still only a handful of
Indian-owned motels, one of them owned by Bhulabhai Vanmalibhai
Patel _ whose grandson Pramod Patel is today a hotelier in the Bay
Area; his company's portfolio includes Holiday Inns, Ramadas and
Comfort Inns.
 &HT;    According to Pramod, his grandfather left his Gujarati village
in 1949, at the age of 29, for a better life in America. ``Only 100
Indians a year were allowed into the country in those days,''
Pramod says. ``My grandfather came, met Desai and decided to copy
him. So he leased the Auburn Hotel in downtown San Francisco that
same year.''
 &HT;    By the 1960s, Pramod estimates, there were still only 60 or 70
Indian-owned motels, mostly in California. Evolving immigration
laws helped the next wave of pioneers make their mark in the 1970s.
At the time, explains David Mumford, the president of Mumford Co.,
a hotel brokerage in Newport News, Va., ``many American motel
owners, people I call Mr. and Mrs. Jones, were aging. Motels were a
postwar thing, and by the mid-'70s a lot of the people who owned
them were of retiring age. Their kids were not interested in the
business.''
 &HT;    The concurrent global oil crisis meant people were taking fewer
driving vacations, which hurt the motel business. Property prices
were depressed. ``By the late 1970s and early 1980s, hundreds of
motels were up for sale,'' Mumford continues.
 &HT;    So why were these Indians attracted to them? I got a more
prosaic answer to that question from Vilpesh Patel, the owner of
the 85-room Flamingo Inn in Windsor, Conn. ``Technically, it's easy
to run. You don't need fluent English, just the will to work long
hours,'' he says. ``And it's a business that comes with a house _
you don't have to buy a separate house. Another important thing,''
he adds, ``is the cash flow. We like that.''
 &HT;    Vilpesh was a plain-speaker. True, the guest is God. But the
guest is also gold _ gold enough for Indian motel ownership to
spiral upward, year by year.
 &HT;    Buying a motel, even one that's in the red, usually requires a
substantial down payment, one beyond the reach of most new
immigrants. That, however, is one key to how this particular niche
was captured. The down payment was seldom a problem for a
prospective Indian purchaser, who was often able to turn to a
network of relatives and friends to help him out.
 &HT;    The story of Lata and P.J., for example, is not exactly the
hardscrabble tale associated with some immigrant groups. Following
an arranged marriage in 1976 in the Gujarati town of Nadiad, they
left for the United States, but not out of desperation or a lack of
options at home. They left behind enviable social status; their
families employed cooks, watchmen, sweepers, a chauffeur. P.J.'s
family owned a marble mine.
 &HT;    ``We had a comfortable life in India,'' he says. They simply
wanted independence _ freedom from the web of their extended
family, with its pressures to share and to conform _ and the simple
pleasure of living as a nuclear family.
 &HT;    In 1991, the Jasper motel's owner (also an Indian) offered P.J.
the place for $150,000; the couple cobbled together the $20,000
down payment from their own savings and loans from friends and
family. ``It was not hard for us to do.''
 &HT;    All of this is not to suggest that the road was an easy one. A
significant number of motel owners have come not directly from
India but from East Africa. The British brought thousands of
Indians to their colonies there in the last century to serve as

 By PETER BOGDANOVICH  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    After Stanley Kubrick died in his sleep of a heart attack on
March 7, even the New York tabloids reported the news with an
auteur slant, headlining the director's generally bleak view of
life. Words like ``secretive,'' ``reclusive,'' ``strange,''
``mysterious'' and ``cold'' were repeatedly used to describe him.
It's true that the 13 feature-length films he made over 40 years
present a disenchanted, sardonic and generally pessimistic view of
humanity, but the lifelong friends, intimate associates and family
members I spoke to conjure a far more complicated picture of a man
who could be deeply reserved but also outgoing, meticulous and laid
back, loving and self-absorbed.
 &HT;    The precocious son of a Bronx, N.Y., doctor, Kubrick became a
staff photographer for Look magazine at 17, but from the start he
was captivated by the movies. He began as a kind of one-man band,
financing, directing, producing, writing, shooting and editing
three short documentaries _ ``Day of the Fight'' (1950), ``Flying
Padre'' (1951) and ``The Seafarers'' (1953) _ and then doing
virtually the same thing for his first two extremely low-budget
features, ``Fear and Desire'' (1953), backed entirely by an uncle,
and ``Killer's Kiss'' (1955).
 &HT;    In 1954, having already run through two marriages, Kubrick moved
to Los Angeles and formed a production company with his friend
James B. Harris, through which he made his first two professional
pictures, the film noir ``The Killing'' (1956), with Sterling
Hayden, and the powerful antiwar drama ``Paths of Glory'' (1957),
starring Kirk Douglas. While shooting ``Paths of Glory'' Kubrick
fell in love with and wed the German painter and actress Christiane
Harlan, with whom he would rear two daughters along with
Christiane's young daughter from an earlier marriage.
 &HT;    ``The Killing'' and ''Paths of Glory'' did not make money, but
they did make Kubrick's reputation as a budding genius among
critics and studio executives. In 1960, Kirk Douglas hired Kubrick
to replace another director on ``Spartacus,'' the only
all-Hollywood production Kubrick would ever make, and his first
box-office success.
 &HT;    He hated the experience. Disenchanted with the industry and
having developed a phobia about flying, the director soon afterward
moved with his family to England, never again to travel far from
home.
 &HT;    Over the next 38 years, he made only eight more films. Between
his controversial adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's notorious
``Lolita'' (1962) and his grim but popular Vietnam war film, ``Full
Metal Jacket'' (1987), Kubrick achieved a kind of mythic status in
world cinema with three hugely successful pictures: his black
comedy of the Cold War, ``Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop
Worrying and Love the Bomb'' (1964), the mystical science-fiction
saga ``2001: A Space Odyssey'' (1968) and his ultraviolent
investigation of violence, ``A Clockwork Orange'' (1971), based on
Anthony Burgess' novel.
 &HT;    (While ``Clockwork'' won the New York Film Critics Circle Award
for best picture, it was wildly criticized in England for inspiring
copycat crimes. Kubrick, wounded by the attacks, withdrew it from
circulation in the UK; to date, it is not available there even on
video.)
 &HT;    The gigantic and enduring box-office appeal and critical
enshrinement of these three films, coupled with the slimness of his
output and his distance _ physical and emotional _ from the
Hollywood mainstream, fueled a kind of legendary aura of integrity
and perfectionism that gave Kubrick enormous power in the industry
he avoided. Still, he was troubled by the fact that ``Barry
Lyndon'' (1975), his costume drama adapted from Thackeray, though
much admired in certain quarters, did not have a box-office
response commensurate with its cost.
 &HT;    His next work was his most openly commercial: ``The Shining''
(1980), based on a Stephen King horror novel and headlining a major
star, Jack Nicholson.
 &HT;    When he died, at 70, he had just completed ``Eyes Wide Shut,''
based on Arthur Schnitzler's ``Dream Story,'' a project he had been
thinking about for more than 30 years. The film, which deals
candidly with sexual relations between a contemporary New York
married couple, played by the husband-and-wife team of Tom Cruise
and Nicole Kidman, opens in the United States July 16.
 &HT;    I cannot say I knew Kubrick, though we spoke briefly on the
phone two or three times in the early '70s. He was preparing to
shoot ``Barry Lyndon'' and he called me out of the blue. His voice
sounded extremely youthful, with a subdued but definite Bronx
accent and a kind of reticence and self-effacement that was
disarming.
 &HT;    He asked what I thought about Ryan O'Neal, whom I had directed
in ``What's Up, Doc?'' Kubrick's young daughters were fans of the
movie and now were lobbying their father to cast O'Neal in ``Barry
Lyndon.'' Even in that brief exchange, Kubrick's obsessions _ film
and family _ were twinned. They would remain that way until the
end.
 -0- 
 &HT;    MATTHEW MODINE (actor; lead role in ``Full Metal Jacket''): One
day I said: ``I got a joke for you. ... You're dead.'' He said,
``It's not funny.'' I said: ``Let me tell the joke. Steven
Spielberg's dead too.'' He said, ``Steven's dead, oh, that's
funny.'' And I said: ``You're dead and you're up in heaven and
Steven Spielberg has just died and he's being greeted at the gate
by Gabriel and Gabriel says: 'God's really dug a lot of your movies
and he wants to make sure that you're comfortable. If there's
anything you need, you come to me, I'm your man.' And Steven says,
'Well, you know, I always wanted to meet Stanley Kubrick, do you
think you could arrange that?' And Gabriel looks at him and says:
'You know, Steven, of all the things that you could ask for, why
would you ask for that? You know that Stanley doesn't take
meetings.' He says, 'Well, you said that if there was anything I
wanted.' Gabriel says: 'I'm really sorry. I can't do that.' So now
he's showing him around heaven and Steven sees this guy wearing an
Army jacket with a beard riding a bicycle. And Steven says to
Gabriel: 'Oh, my God, look, over there, that's Stanley Kubrick.
Couldn't we just stop him and say hello?' And Gabriel pulls Steven
to the side and says, 'That's not Stanley Kubrick; that's God _ he
just thinks he's Stanley Kubrick.' `` Stanley liked that joke.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    RICHARD ANDERSON (actor; producer; dialogue coach and actor on
``Paths of Glory''): He had dark circles under his eyes, his hair
all over the place. Stanley was a pro at chess _ he'd sit down and
play chess on the set. He was very interested in people's motives,
people's psyches. ... One time when Kirk Douglas blew up at him on
the set, Stanley said, ``Jeez, Kirk, you don't have to do this in
front of everybody, do you?'' But he admired Kirk. He said, ``My
God, this guy always knows his lines.''
 &HT;    Stanley is very psychological to get what he wants. One time he
had done about 40 takes and Jimmy Harris (Kubrick's producing
partner on ``Paths of Glory'' and other films) comes and says,
``Stanley, it's now 1 o'clock and we're in terrible trouble and we
gotta break this up.''
 &HT;    That was the only time I saw Stanley go nuts. He shouted, ''It
isn't right _ and I'm going to keep doing it until it is right!''
He shot 84 takes. I think he wanted everybody to hear that _ he
wanted it to get around.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    TONY CURTIS (actor; co-star of ``Spartacus''): Stanley would
never capitulate. I remember he asked for 15 or 20 extras for a
little scene and the assistant director came over and said they had
talked it over (with the studio) and decided to cut down the amount
of extras. And Stanley said, ``No, we'll double the amount.'' He
refused to allow anybody to tell him how to do the picture.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    SHELLEY WINTERS (actress; co-star of ``Lolita''): He was very
cognizant that actors are delicate. He would discuss the scene with
you and you never thought you were being directed until you saw the
rushes the next day. You almost said, ``Gee, wasn't I clever to
think of that?'' But it was Stanley who had sort of planted it very
subtly in your head. Like the dance I did with James Mason _ a sexy
sort of South American dance _ he didn't really tell me to make a
sexy dance. I decided to flirt with him while I was dancing in a
sexy way and he said, ``That's it.'' He was very elusive. Sometimes
you might rehearse and you didn't even know he was watching. He'd
be off somewhere, sort of hidden, watching.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    KEN ADAM (production designer; designed ``Dr. Strangelove'' and
``Barry Lyndon''): I don't think I ever had such a close
relationship with a director. There was a certain naivete and charm
about him, but you very quickly found out that there was an
enormous brain functioning. I think the most difficult part was his
questioning, almost computerlike, mind. He knew most of the
technicians' work better than the technicians themselves. ...
 &HT;    He very often changed his mind. After two days of shooting, for
example, he wasn't happy with Peter Sellers playing the B-52
bomber-captain (in addition to his other roles) and he cast Slim
Pickens instead and then decided to have him ride the atomic bomb
bronco-fashion into the Russian missile complex. It was a very
exciting experience, but at the same time, I felt, you know, one
film would be enough. Being exposed to Stanley 16 hours a day, you
lost your resistance, and the danger was you would lose your
confidence.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    JAMES EARL JONES (actor; small role in ``Dr. Strangelove''): His
manner was casual. Very, very laid back. Chewed gum. Cool. One day
he got pissed off at me when I didn't know my lines. I had missed a
section I was supposed to memorize. He said: ``You don't know these
words? Why don't you know these words?'' It was a quiet pissed, but
he was pissed.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    JOHN MILIUS (director, screenwriter, producer): When he did
``Dr. Strangelove,'' the Air Force contacted him afterward and all
the big shots of Strategic Air Command, and General Le May, wante
to talk to him. And he was afraid of going to see them. He was
afraid they'd be angry with him _ that they would do something to
him. I said: ``Stanley, how can you have been that paranoid? They
wanted to honor you. They loved 'Dr. Strangelove.' `` He said: ``I
know it's crazy. I wish I'd gone to Washington and seen them.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    KEIR DULLEA (actor; co-star of ``2001''): I was always aware
that he knew exactly what he wanted. He would invite (me) to have
dinner at his beautiful home. And he would invite a lot of other
people from all walks of life and different disciplines _ art
historians, authors and intellectuals. And he was as informed as
anybody about their disciplines. ... If Stanley had been an
octopus, with that many arms, he would have held his own camera,
done his own makeup, built his own sets. But I had a feeling he
wouldn't have acted in his own films.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    JAN HARLAN (producer; Kubrick's brother-in-law; production
assistant on ``A Clockwork Orange''): He felt very misunderstood
about (the violent, negative reactions to) ``Clockwork Orange,''
very insulted.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MILIUS: He was very vulnerable to criticism or to whether a
movie was a success or not. He wasn't completely comfortable with
``Barry Lyndon.'' He just felt that people didn't understand it.
People were bored by it. I think after that picture he felt no one
was going to let him make a film again. Apparently the only thing
that really bothered him a great deal was that ''Barry Lyndon''
failed commercially. He made ``The Shining'' after that. Nicholson,
I remember, at the time said: ``I'm glad to be off that one. That
was rough duty.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    CHRISTIANE KUBRICK: People always think he was this idiotic
dictator. He was always asking everyone's opinion on most things.
What do you think of this? What do you think of that? Do you think
I should have done this different? He spread his palette of ideas
for everyone to have a pick at, and would dismiss you brutally if
he thought that what you said was really irritating.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    LEE ERMEY (Vietnam Marine Corps veteran; technical adviser,
script consultant, actor on ``Full Metal Jacket''): Stanley told me
he didn't understand actors. He had no actor friends _ they were
basically working associates, and he thought they were a little bit
strange, totally spoiled and in most cases had to be begged to give
him a decent performance. Half the time the actor would argue with
him.
 &HT;    Vince D'Onofrio didn't like Stanley's ``craziness look.'' He
wanted to try it some other way. The problem with Vince was this
was his first film, and he's telling Stanley Kubrick how he thinks
this look should be. They stand there arguing. Stanley finally
said, ``Look, do it my way and we'll load back up and we'll shoot
it your way.'' Well, when they shot it Vince's way they didn't have
any film in the camera.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MODINE: I once asked him why he so often did a lot of takes. He
said it was because actors didn't know their lines. And he talked
about Jack Nicholson: ``Jack would come in during the blocking and
he kind of fumbled through the lines. He'd be learning them while
he was there. And then you'd start shooting and after take 3 or
take 4 or take 5 you'd get the Jack Nicholson that everybody knows
and most directors would be happy with. And then you'd go up to 10
or 15 and he'd be really awful and then he'd start to understand
what the lines were, what the lines meant, and then he'd become
unconscious about what he was saying. So by take 30 or take 40 the
lines became something else.'' Stanley'd say: ``I don't know how to
do it. People don't do their homework, the only thing I can do is
spend time doing multiple takes while the people are learning what
their job is supposed to be.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    CHRISTIANE KUBRICK: He thought it was boring away from home. He
liked all his stuff around him, all his telephones and televisions
and fax machines. Also, we have a zoo. We have a lot of animals and
he liked those and he liked the children and later the
grandchildren. He liked being at home. But not like a hermit _ he
had lots of friends _ they just weren't in the film business. He
talked to everyone _ he just didn't talk to the press.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    SYDNEY POLLACK (director, producer, actor; phone relationship
with Kubrick since early '70s; featured role in ``Eyes Wide
Shut''): My initial take on my part (in ``Eyes Wide Shut'') was
very different from what Stanley wanted. I came in with the idea of
being tougher with the character of Tom (Cruise) because he had
done something that I disapproved of strongly. And then Stanley had
an idea of my wanting to manipulate him more and therefore be
kinder, and he was very specific about how to communicate that. He
knew I was another director - he didn't have to beat around the
bush. He wasn't trying to work any psychological tricks with me.
And he was crazy about both Tom and Nicole.
 &HT;    I always think of Stanley literally on the edge of a smile. His
eyes always had mischief in them. He always had this sense of the
devil in him while he was very calmly asking questions. He read
everything, and knew absolutely all aspects of the business,
including literally what the box-office receipts of every theater
in the world were over the past few years. ...
 &HT;    Cruise woke me up on Thursday morning to tell me how great he
thought the picture was. I called Stanley and we talked for an hour
and a half or so and I told him how thrilled Tom was. Then I spoke
with Terry and Bob (Daly, co-chairman of Warner Brothers) and they
were absolutely ecstatic, and four days later he died.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    STEVE SOUTHGATE: ....... Two days before he died, he sent me
over to Las Vegas with the first trailer of ``Eyes Wide Shut'' for
the Sho West convention. As it was the first time ever that anyone
was going to see anything from the movie, he wanted to make sure
that the projection was perfect. He gave me specific instructions:
We had to clear the room at 3 o'clock in the morning, make sure
everybody was gone and just the projectionist and I rehearsed it.
The last conversation I had was: ``I trust you to go and do this in
Vegas. Let me know how everybody reacts. Ring me during the
screening _ take your mobile phone _ I want to hear what the
reaction is.'' And while I was on the plane, he died.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    CHRISTIANE KUBRICK: I thought he was awfully tired, and he never
slept much _ ever _ in his whole life. Then I thought he was really
overdoing it with this last film. Sleeping less and less. He also
was a doctor's son and he wouldn't see a doctor. He gave himself
his own medicine if he wasn't feeling well or he would phone
friends _ it was the one thing he did that I thought was really
stupid.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    POLLACK: People say he had these phobias, he wouldn't go here
and wouldn't go there. The truth is he lived in a paradise _ there
wasn't any reason for him to go anywhere. It was a kind of a
heaven.

 By NORIMITSU ONISHI  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    The delta region of southern Nigeria, where the mighty Niger
River drains into the Atlantic Ocean, includes some of the most
inhospitable territory on earth.
 &HT;    It's the world's largest mangrove swamp, 14,000 square miles of
thickets, channels and lagoons all but impenetrable to any but the
most practiced eye. It's also oil country, dotted with wells and
flow stations, where about 2 million barrels of crude are collected
each day and piped to central stations for transport abroad.
 &HT;    Helicopter is the preferred mode of transport, for the lucky few
who can afford it. One of those is Leonard Hutto, the
superintendent of Chevron's operations in the eastern Niger Delta,
and on this day it was his chopper that hovered tentatively above
one of Chevron's 30-odd oil stations in the area.
 &HT;    The landing pad, a few hundred feet below, was thronged with
hundreds of angry young Nigerians peering up at the midmorning sky,
clearly shouting and shaking their fists. Seeing that they did not
have guns, Hutto finally told the pilot to land.
 &HT;    At the same moment, down on the flow station, standing atop a
table inside a tiny office, surrounded by dozens of young men
brandishing machetes, Hutto's Nigerian assistant, Tony Okoaye, was
relieved to hear the helicopter's engine drown out the shouts of
his captors.
 &HT;    To hear Okoaye tell it, a predawn phone call had jerked him out
of bed: 400 villagers had invaded the site, carrying with them a
long list of demands. By 7 a.m., Okoaye had driven to the station,
only to be taken hostage. Okoaye, an American-educated engineer
normally prone to fits of delirious laughter, was not laughing.
 &HT;    The young men, many drunk or high on marijuana, made him stand
on the table for hours, slapping his pudgy frame and jabbing
forefingers into the soft belly above his Tommy Hilfiger jeans.
``Ah, hah!'' they taunted. ``You're a big man!''
 &HT;    They ordered him to shut down the oil wells. Okoaye did so,
reluctantly. ''You don't want to lose one barrel.'' Then they
demanded to see his boss, Hutto. ``We want to see the white man,''
they told him. ``The American.''
 &HT;    And so after a half-hour helicopter ride from Chevron's eastern
headquarters in the city of Port Harcourt, the American oilman from
south Texas had arrived. ``What a pain,'' Hutto remembers thinking,
as his chopper descended from the sky and the Nigerians scattered.
 &HT;    What came next would nonplus the most seasoned executive at a
Fortune 500 company, but to the oilman it was Kabuki. After the
youths agreed to let him call a police escort, Hutto got into a
Toyota pickup and drove a few miles to the village.
 &HT;    There, in the shade of a huge tree, he sat on a folding chair
through the afternoon, listening to the community's grievances and
demands: more scholarships for its youngsters and more regular
meetings with Chevron, which the locals would get, and other
demands, which they would not, including 25 jobs on the spot, about
$27,000 in cash and an unspecified amount for the wages they had
lost while busy invading the oil station.
 &HT;    Hutto instead slipped $50 to the town chiefs for drinks, $20 to
the youths and another $20 to a group of young men who had let the
air out of the tires of the Toyota _ to reinflate them.
 &HT;    His assistant was released, the valves were opened at the oil
wells and crude began coursing through the pipelines to the flow
station. A few thousand barrels had been lost. ``Not a big deal,''
Hutto says.
 &HT;    Routine, in fact, in the Niger Delta, where men usually focused
on finding and extracting hydrocarbons are forced to act as
politicians, diplomats and mediators. These are roles that Western
oilmen are increasingly playing as they seek crude in war-ravaged
and lawless places such as Angola and Congo, nations in name alone.
 &HT;    Hutto spent 12 years in Congo, the former Zaire, where frequent
crises forced him to sleep on an offshore oil platform, a fortress
in the Atlantic Ocean several miles from a land of chaos. The Niger
Delta is not just physically inhospitable. It is also the most
combustible oil-rich corner on the planet _ simply the most
difficult and dangerous assignment for an oilman.
 &HT;    In Hutto's office, a framed black-and-white photograph on the
wall is a constant reminder of the price of peacekeeping in the
delta. It shows Hutto standing next to some chiefs in Kula at the
dedication of a $125,000 town-hall center built by Chevron.
 &HT;    The photograph was taken a year ago, soon after Hutto arrived in
Nigeria, just in time to see the death of Gen. Sani Abacha unleash
a bewildering series of events that culminated in the installation
of a new civilian government in May.
 &HT;    In the past year, the troubles in the Niger Delta have become
more evident. Its boldest residents, whose anger had been contained
by Abacha's fiercely repressive dictatorship, have invaded oil
stations, kidnapped workers and committed sabotage against
pipelines.
 &HT;    Last fall, the unrest slashed Nigeria's daily oil production by
a third. The revolt, deadlier, more widespread and better organized
than the isolated protests of previous years, led many in Nigeria
to talk of a coming civil war.
 &HT;    All of which has transformed the simple task of pumping crude
into a strange exercise in diplomacy, civics and bluff, less the
oil business than an exercise in velvet-gloved imperialism. The
Western oil companies find themselves in the peculiar position of
providing services usually met by government _ supplying
electricity and water, building roads, bridges, schools and
hospitals. Mostly, they have done this to stop rising public
discontent from making it impossible for them to pump oil.
 &HT;    The unrest is rooted in four decades of gross state neglect.
Successive military regimes dominated by Muslim northerners have
kept the Niger Delta and its 7 million people severely undeveloped,
while enforcing few, if any, environmental standards.
 &HT;    ``Our responsibility, our duty, our obligation is to redress the
neglect of the past,'' Nigeria's newly elected president, Olusegun
Obasanjo, said during a visit this month to the delta. This was
after a new wave of violence swept the area the day after his
inauguration, leaving scores of Nigerians dead. ''But please,
please, give us the opportunity. Give us time.''
 &HT;    For now, while the roads in the rest of the country may be bad,
they are virtually nonexistent here. The state-owned power utility
lines do not reach here. Not only has little of the estimated $275
billion the country has earned from oil since the mid-1970s been
spent here, but $50 billion of it has just disappeared overseas,
according to a U.S. official in Nigeria.
 &HT;    In Port Harcourt, Chevron's offices are in a walled-off compound
of white one-story buildings. The chiefs drop by, one after the
other, every day Hutto is here. Overall, he says, he now spends at
least 60 percent of his time on community relations. Damian Obiagu,
a chief in a town called Izombe, has been pressing Hutto to make a
Chevron contractor hire local youths as casuals. In all likelihood,
ghost workers will be hired.
 &HT;    ``They don't show up for work,'' Hutto explains. ``You don't
want them to. You don't want a person on a jack-up barge or
drilling rig who doesn't know anything about safety.''
 &HT;    But the ghost workers serve an important purpose. They allow the
chief to claim he has won jobs for his people and the oil company
to say it has hired from the community. The fiction is necessary
because it is virtually impossible to find qualified oil workers
among the delta residents.
 &HT;    At one of the wells, Chevron awarded Obiagu a contract to
provide ``security.'' But one day, displeased, the chief's men
invaded the well. ``No, no, Damian, you don't understand,'' Hutto
recalls telling the chief. ``You're our security contractor, to
protect us. You're not looking to threaten us. 'Oh! oh!' he said.
He's a nice old man.''
 &HT;    Since taking over Gulf Oil in 1984, Chevron has pumped many
billions of dollars' worth of oil in Nigeria, 418,000 barrels a day
in 1998. In 1998, Chevron Corp.'s total worldwide revenues amounted
to $30.6 billion; Nigeria's gross national product was estimated by
the World Bank to be $30.7 billion in 1997. Nigeria's GNP, while a
pittance alongside the West's economies, is one of Africa's
biggest.
 &HT;    Kingdom Dateme, the king of a town called Idama, has been
pushing for a bigger personal contract, Hutto tells Okoaye. ``He
wants a contract so that he can get a big house now,'' Hutto says.
 &HT;    ``In his village?'' Okoaye asks.
 &HT;    ``No, here.'
 &HT;    ``Here in PH?'' Okoaye laughs, adding, ``That guy, he's
something else, eh?''
 &HT;    ``He's looking for a half-million, million Naira contract,''
Hutto says, the equivalent of $5,000 to $10,000. ``With those he
can buy his own big house here.''
 &HT;    Okoaye laughs uproariously, before adding with some finality,
``He's a pig.'' Then softening up a bit, Okoaye asks his boss:
``But he doesn't really make trouble for you. He doesn't really
bother you, does he? He's just greedy.''
 &HT;    ``Well,'' Hutto says, ``they're all greedy.''
 &HT;    After work, Hutto drives home in his white Toyota Landcruiser
through Port Harcourt's ``go slows,'' or traffic jams. Boys hawking
everything from toilet paper to power tools dart to his side with
cries of ``Master!'' A Nigerian policeman, gripping a tear-gas
rifle in his hands, rides shotgun. More policemen guard Hutto's
villa, a two-story white house.
 &HT;    Never married, Hutto lives alone, not counting the houseboy in
the backyard bungalow. Inside a large freezer, he keeps the 50 New
York sirloin and T-bone steaks that he brought back from his last
visit to the United States and has been cooking, at the rate of one
a week, on a grill that he keeps in his living room.
 &HT;    A year ago Hutto accepted the assignment in Port Harcourt, a
position the company considers difficult to fill because there is
no rotation schedule, no other Americans and constant interaction
with Chevron's delta neighbors. In Lagos, the Americans live inside
headquarters, a sprawling campus surrounded by high walls, a
surreal replica of America with wide streets and suburban houses
straight out of Westchester County. Here, Hutto is alone.
 &HT;    And to the thousands in the delta, Leonard Hutto is Chevron Oil.
For years, the oil companies ignored the squalid conditions in the
delta, content to pump oil and get their profits out. But,
particularly after 1995, they were forced to change their approach.
 &HT;    General Abacha's regime hanged the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa after he
demanded reparations for his Ogoni people, who remained
impoverished despite the long presence of Royal Dutch/Shell in
their region. Nigeria became an international pariah. Shell, the
biggest producer in the country, suffered a public-relations black
eye and began a review of its relations with its host communities.
The other companies increased their community contributions.
 &HT;    But violence has risen and taken on different forms. The
deadliest has been fighting among the delta's ethnic groups,
competing against one another for jobs or claims to oil-rich areas.
The Nigerian military has also engaged in battles with rioters, and
the oil companies have been criticized for their coziness with the
military.
 &HT;    A recent report by the New York-based Human Rights Watch says
the oil companies have looked away whenever the military has
brutalized or killed protesters. In Chevron's case, Human Rights
Watch says that twice in the last year the military used Chevron
boats and helicopters to crack down on protesters. Four villagers
were killed in one incident, according to the organization.
 &HT;    Like the other oil companies, Chevron argues that its hands are
tied in these situations. The companies are minority partners in
joint ventures with the government and say they cannot refuse any
requests by the military to use equipment leased by the joint
venture.
 &HT;    What's more, the companies point out, their workers have often
been hurt. In December, six of Chevron's Nigerian employees were
kidnapped and are presumed dead.
 &HT;    In Kula, about a year ago, 25 youths were jailed after invading
a Chevron oil rig. Shell, which has three stations and an extremely
strained relationship with Kula, experienced an average of two
shutdowns per month last year. In May, 50 young men invaded a Shell
station and closed it for five days, for a loss of 134,050 barrels
of oil, worth about $2.4 million.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, one wonders whether President Obasanjo's pleas for
time and another chance will be heeded. Will he push through
policies to reform the entrenched system of corruption and
pay-offs? Or will the angriest people of the delta grow ever more
angry? And will they be emboldened _ now that civilians, not
soldiers, rule the country _ to create more disorder?
 &HT;    At the office in Port Harcourt, Hutto and Okoaye are standing
outside under the canopy on one rainy day, and Hutto's voice is
raspy, sore from several days of negotiating for the release of an
American worker _ ``a big guy from Alabama.''
 &HT;    It seems he took his boat up a canal near the oil station in
Kula to check on a well when half a dozen young men jumped him. The
worker spent nine days in the mangrove swamp with his captors
pointing guns at his head. After a $25,000 ransom is paid, the
Alabama man is released.
 &HT;    ``I don't know how we'll operate,'' Okoaye says, worried that
such incidents will rise under the new civilian government. ``I
don't know, because security is going to be a big problem.'' Hutto
rubs his forefinger and thumb together.
 &HT;    ``Sometimes it doesn't go far enough, money alone,'' Okoaye
says.
 &HT;    ``Yeah, spend more money?''
 &HT;    ``Spend more money.''
 &HT;    ``Keep them quiet? Make them happy?''
 &HT;    ``Yup.''

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    The delta region of southern Nigeria, where the mighty Niger
River drains into the Atlantic Ocean, includes some of the most
inhospitable territory on earth.
 &HT;    It's the world's largest mangrove swamp, 14,000 square miles of
thickets, channels and lagoons all but impenetrable to any but the
most practiced eye. It's also oil country, dotted with wells and
flow stations, where about 2 million barrels of crude are collected
each day and piped to central stations for transport abroad.
 &HT;    Helicopter is the preferred mode of transport, for the lucky few
who can afford it. One of those is Leonard Hutto, the
superintendent of Chevron's operations in the eastern Niger Delta,
and on this day it was his chopper that hovered tentatively above
one of Chevron's 30-odd oil stations in the area.
 &HT;    The landing pad, a few hundred feet below, was thronged with
hundreds of angry young Nigerians peering up at the midmorning sky,
clearly shouting and shaking their fists. Seeing that they did not
have guns, Hutto finally told the pilot to land.
 &HT;    At the same moment, down on the flow station, standing atop a
table inside a tiny office, surrounded by dozens of young men
brandishing machetes, Hutto's Nigerian assistant, Tony Okoaye, was
relieved to hear the helicopter's engine drown out the shouts of
his captors.
 &HT;    To hear Okoaye tell it, a predawn phone call had jerked him out
of bed: 400 villagers had invaded the site, carrying with them a
long list of demands. By 7 a.m., Okoaye had driven to the station,
only to be taken hostage. Okoaye, an American-educated engineer
normally prone to fits of delirious laughter, was not laughing.
 &HT;    The young men, many drunk or high on marijuana, made him stand
on the table for hours, slapping his pudgy frame and jabbing
forefingers into the soft belly above his Tommy Hilfiger jeans.
``Ah, hah!'' they taunted. ``You're a big man!''
 &HT;    They ordered him to shut down the oil wells. Okoaye did so,
reluctantly. ''You don't want to lose one barrel.'' Then they
demanded to see his boss, Hutto. ``We want to see the white man,''
they told him. ``The American.''
 &HT;    And so after a half-hour helicopter ride from Chevron's eastern
headquarters in the city of Port Harcourt, the American oilman from
south Texas had arrived. ``What a pain,'' Hutto remembers thinking,
as his chopper descended from the sky and the Nigerians scattered.
 &HT;    What came next would nonplus the most seasoned executive at a
Fortune 500 company, but to the oilman it was Kabuki. After the
youths agreed to let him call a police escort, Hutto got into a
Toyota pickup and drove a few miles to the village.
 &HT;    There, in the shade of a huge tree, he sat on a folding chair
through the afternoon, listening to the community's grievances and
demands: more scholarships for its youngsters and more regular
meetings with Chevron, which the locals would get, and other
demands, which they would not, including 25 jobs on the spot, about
$27,000 in cash and an unspecified amount for the wages they had
lost while busy invading the oil station.
 &HT;    Hutto instead slipped $50 to the town chiefs for drinks, $20 to
the youths and another $20 to a group of young men who had let the
air out of the tires of the Toyota _ to reinflate them.
 &HT;    His assistant was released, the valves were opened at the oil
wells and crude began coursing through the pipelines to the flow
station. A few thousand barrels had been lost. ``Not a big deal,''
Hutto says.
 &HT;    Routine, in fact, in the Niger Delta, where men usually focused
on finding and extracting hydrocarbons are forced to act as
politicians, diplomats and mediators. These are roles that Western
oilmen are increasingly playing as they seek crude in war-ravaged
and lawless places such as Angola and Congo, nations in name alone.
 &HT;    Hutto spent 12 years in Congo, the former Zaire, where frequent
crises forced him to sleep on an offshore oil platform, a fortress
in the Atlantic Ocean several miles from a land of chaos. The Niger
Delta is not just physically inhospitable. It is also the most
combustible oil-rich corner on the planet _ simply the most
difficult and dangerous assignment for an oilman.
 &HT;    In Hutto's office, a framed black-and-white photograph on the
wall is a constant reminder of the price of peacekeeping in the
delta. It shows Hutto standing next to some chiefs in Kula at the
dedication of a $125,000 town-hall center built by Chevron.
 &HT;    The photograph was taken a year ago, soon after Hutto arrived in
Nigeria, just in time to see the death of Gen. Sani Abacha unleash
a bewildering series of events that culminated in the installation
of a new civilian government in May.
 &HT;    In the past year, the troubles in the Niger Delta have become
more evident. Its boldest residents, whose anger had been contained
by Abacha's fiercely repressive dictatorship, have invaded oil
stations, kidnapped workers and committed sabotage against
pipelines.
 &HT;    Last fall, the unrest slashed Nigeria's daily oil production by
a third. The revolt, deadlier, more widespread and better organized
than the isolated protests of previous years, led many in Nigeria
to talk of a coming civil war.
 &HT;    All of which has transformed the simple task of pumping crude
into a strange exercise in diplomacy, civics and bluff, less the
oil business than an exercise in velvet-gloved imperialism. The
Western oil companies find themselves in the peculiar position of
providing services usually met by government _ supplying
electricity and water, building roads, bridges, schools and
hospitals. Mostly, they have done this to stop rising public
discontent from making it impossible for them to pump oil.
 &HT;    The unrest is rooted in four decades of gross state neglect.
Successive military regimes dominated by Muslim northerners have
kept the Niger Delta and its 7 million people severely undeveloped,
while enforcing few, if any, environmental standards.
 &HT;    ``Our responsibility, our duty, our obligation is to redress the
neglect of the past,'' Nigeria's newly elected president, Olusegun
Obasanjo, said during a visit this month to the delta. This was
after a new wave of violence swept the area the day after his
inauguration, leaving scores of Nigerians dead. ''But please,
please, give us the opportunity. Give us time.''
 &HT;    For now, while the roads in the rest of the country may be bad,
they are virtually nonexistent here. The state-owned power utility
lines do not reach here. Not only has little of the estimated $275
billion the country has earned from oil since the mid-1970s been
spent here, but $50 billion of it has just disappeared overseas,
according to a U.S. official in Nigeria.
 &HT;    In Port Harcourt, Chevron's offices are in a walled-off compound

a chief in a town called Izombe, has been pressing Hutto to make a
Chevron contractor hire local youths as casuals. In all likelihood,
ghost workers will be hired.
 &HT;    ``They don't show up for work,'' Hutto explains. ``You don't
want them to. You don't want a person on a jack-up barge or
drilling rig who doesn't know anything about safety.''
 &HT;    But the ghost workers serve an important purpose. They allow the

 &HT;    Kingdom Dateme, the king of a town called Idama, has been
pushing for a bigger personal contract, Hutto tells Okoaye. ``He
wants a contract so that he can get a big house now,'' Hutto says.
 &HT;    ``In his village?'' Okoaye asks.
 &HT;    ``No, here.'
 &HT;    ``Here in PH?'' Okoaye laughs, adding, ``That guy, he's
something else, eh?''
 &HT;    ``He's looking for a half-million, million Naira contract,''
Hutto says, the equivalent of $5,000 to $10,000. ``With those he

everything from toilet paper to power tools dart to his side with
cries of ``Master!'' A Nigerian policeman, gripping a tear-gas
rifle in his hands, rides shotgun. More policemen guard Hutto's
villa, a two-story white house.
 &HT;    Never married, Hutto lives alone, not counting the houseboy in
the backyard bungalow. Inside a large freezer, he keeps the 50 New
York sirloin and T-bone steaks that he brought back from his last
visit to the United States and has been cooking, at the rate of one
a week, on a grill that he keeps in his living room.

JENNIFER GRANT GETS A SHOW TO MATCH HER IMPECCABLE ACTING PEDIGREE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite her ``tennis-anyone?'' cheeriness and fistful of
generous press notices, Jennifer Grant has spent most of her acting
career bobbing along at the edges of mainstream attention. Her
resume is decorated with bright, too-brief moments in television
series, specials and feature films, but she has done nothing that
would constitute what you'd call a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you count her birth.
</P>
<P>
   Dad Cary Grant was 62 when Jennifer was born in 1966; mother
Dyan Cannon was 27. Opportunistic Hollywood salivated, figuring
Jennifer's bloodline was a can't-miss, bankable commodity.
Producers offered her film roles, talent unseen. She was a kid, no
more than 8, when the scripts started rolling in, followed by
agents and managers and other would-be Tinseltown parasites.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents slammed the door on everyone and everything. The way
Jennifer tells it, now that she's 33 and days from her co-starring
debut in the appropriately titled ``Movie Stars,'' a summer sitcom
series debuting Sunday on WB, her dad hated the idea of his only
daughter acting. Mom was just as leery, warning her of the constant
rejections and the industry's superficiality.
</P>
<P>
   Cary Grant was particularly critical of Hollywood's treatment of
women, saying they were required to work harder for lesser roles,
and usually with their clothes completely off or at least dangling.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents' discouragement initially worked, as Jennifer
learned early on that her sanity hinged on sidestepping the
pressure to go into the family business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just too terrified to act,'' says Jennifer, who didn't
want the pressure of gene-pool expectations or dealing with a
resentful industry questioning how she landed her roles. ``I always
wanted to. But when you're expected to do something, yet people are
envious when you do, it's a bit nerve-racking. I went to an
all-girls Catholic boarding school and was Dolly in ``Hello,
Dolly!'' Not because I wanted to be, but because the nuns literally
plucked me out of class one day and took me to audition.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I had plenty of friends who wanted to be Dolly. But they
took me and made me sing ``Happy Birthday,'' and then gave me the
part, for their own reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer tried to be a normal kid with a normal lifestyle, even
when life consisted of shuttling between her mother's stately beach
house in Malibu and her father's often star-filled mansion in Los
Angeles. (Grant and Cannon divorced a year after Jennifer's birth.)
</P>
<P>
   Parents tried to shield daughter as best they could. Back in
1993, Cannon told Time that her job was to give Jennifer
``groundwork,'' which meant letting her work in health-food stores,
buy clothes in thrift shops and keep the press away. Sure enough,
by the time Jennifer headed to Stanford University, where she
finished a double major in political science and history, she had
experienced little media fanfare.
</P>
<P>
   Lost within the good intentions was, she says now, an identity.
A purpose. A focus. After Stanford, she entered something of a
career twilight zone.
</P>
<P>
   An accomplished equestrian, she did promotional work for the
1987 Breeders' Cup; was an apprentice chef at Spago restaurant
(losing interest after a rack of lamb fell on her head); and worked
in a law office and advocacy firm, where few of her colleagues took
her seriously, having heard of a reported $30 million trust fund
waiting for her after she turned 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had so much frustration with other careers,'' she says. ``I
just couldn't seem to make anything work. And I tried hard. Besides
the fact that (my parents) had natural ideas of what they wanted me
to be, a lawyer being the biggest one. So I tried to play out their
stuff and then tried lots of other things. Finally, I just _ at the
insistence of a girlfriend _ took an acting class for fun.''
</P>
<P>
   That was in 1990. She said she felt her whole body kind of
settle. ``I thought, boy, this is what I want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   She refused door-opening help from her mother. Roles didn't come
readily. She landed a recurring part on ``Beverly Hills, 90210'' in
1993, playing the sexy game-show contestant, and a small part in
the ``Terms of Endearment'' sequel, ``The Evening Star,'' three
years later.
</P>
<P>
   Her relationship with the press has been an odd one. She gets a
lot of attention for someone who hasn't done much. But because
she's ``someone's'' daughter, the press she receives tends toward
the third-degree type.
</P>
<P>
   ``Movie Stars,'' about an actor couple trying to raise a family,
could change it all. It's certainly an ironic twist for Jennifer.
The actors _ her husband is played by Harry Hamlin _ are definitely
in the star loop, much like Grant and Cannon were. The series aims
to be satirical and sophisticated in presenting a lifestyle that
can be quite bizarre.
</P>
<P>
   Executive Producer Jonathan Axelrod says Jennifer's hiring was
hardly stunt casting. ``She blew us away in the audition, plain and
simple,'' he says. ``We wanted someone who could slide between
being a mother (and being) a sexy actress, and a believable
actress. The last thing you want to do is fill the role of an
award-winning actress with someone who can't act.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer, who looks awfully comfortable acting in the pilot,
says it was the one time she didn't mind her pedigree aiding her.
``I think when I came in to the audition, I might have had a little
bit of an upper hand, in that none of the language was bizarre to
me,'' she says. ``Is this my life? I wouldn't say that. But this
series is more about family and the day-to-day stuff. It just
happens to be natural for me. That's where I have an edge I can
accept.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   About two weeks after Frank Keeney was first connected to cable
modem service in Pasadena, Calif., he discovered that along with
the delights of a 24-hour connection and high-speed Internet access
came the potential for big trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to log in and found that someone had compromised my
computer,'' he recalled. ``When you log into a Linux system, it
will normally show a short message stating the last time logged in
and from where. Since I had not logged in for a week or so, I knew
there was trouble. I checked to see if someone else was online and,
sure enough, he was on at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to kill his log-in session, but it was too late. He
had already issued the command to erase every file on the computer.
I watched while he erased everything on my hard drive.'`
</P>
<P>
   Keeney's experience is not isolated, several computer security
experts said. The shift from dial-up Internet connections to cable
modems and DSL (digital subscriber lines _ fast, constant links to
the Net that use telephone lines) are making home computer users
vulnerable to the types of attacks from hackers that in the past
were almost exclusively a worry for corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people aren't thinking at this level yet,'' said
Christopher Klaus, chief technology officer for Internet Security
Systems, an Atlanta-based maker of complex security analysis
software used by large corporations. ``Service providers are
looking at trying to put as many people on the Internet as
possible. The more security isn't brought up as an issue, the
greater the problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Cable modems and DSL lines are presenting two new problems for
ordinary residential users. The biggest source of trouble comes
simply because these lines mean that users are constantly connected
to the Net, so their computers are always potential targets of
hackers..
</P>
<P>
   The second problem has to do with the types of connections used
by faster lines. Communications between computers on the Internet
rely on a series of numbers known as IP, or Internet protocol,
addresses. For dial-up users, those addresses are constantly
shifting, making them their computers elusive targets. While it can
be a nuisance to dial in to reach the Net every time you want to
check your e-mail, the practice automatically provides its own
measure of security.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately the protection afforded by the dial-up shell game
largely or completely vanishes with cable modems or DSL lines.
Because their customers don't flit on and off the Net, many high
speed service operators give them fixed IP addresses.
</P>
<P>
   While they may not be publicizing their new services' security
problems with the vigor they bring to boasting about the more
desirable features, cable modem and DSL providers acknowledge that
their residential customers are facing new kinds of security woes _
even if personal computers, of course, are less likely to be the
targets of hackers than are corporate or government systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we are today, from a consumer standpoint, is where
companies were back in the late '80s, when firewalls weren't a big
issue,'' said Kevin McElearney, vice president of network support
services at Road Runner, a cable modem partnership that includes
Time Warner Entertainment, the Mediaone Group, Microsoft, Compaq
and Advance/Newhouse. Residential customers using high-speed
services, he said, ``are in an environment where they have to
realize that there are security issues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Your risk is increased the longer you leave any computer
connected,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're learning together in this new world of always being
online in the home,'' said Jeff Waldhuter, director of technology
and engineering at Bell Atlantic Science and Technology Center, the
research branch of the telephone company and DSL service provider.
``Now that we're getting on with these connections, we're learning
that we have to add more security. We're growing up. These networks
are going to be vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   The move to the always-connected world seems to have come at a
somewhat inopportune time. Internet Security Systems has been
tracking a ``dramatic increase'' in the use of a hacking technique
known variously as probing, sniffing or scanning, Klaus said.
Probing software automatically scans computers connected to the
Internet and evaluates the level of their security protection,
looking for weak systems vulnerable to easy attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not uncommon to have someone twist the doorknob of your
home computer,'' McElearney said.
</P>
<P>
   For probers, a typical home computer running Apple's Mac OS or
Windows 95 or 98 without the maker's latest security updates or
additional security software is the closest thing to an unlocked
door they are likely to find.
</P>
<P>
   After his hard drive disaster, Keeney installed security
software on his computer in Pasedena that tracks and records
break-in attempts by probing software. He has found that unwanted
visitors test his computer's security about twice a day. ``Most
computers on cable modems will be probed,'' he said. ``If
weaknesses are found, someone will exploit them.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike people who create and spread viruses or worms, probers
don't need the computer's owner to advance their cause
inadvertently by, say, opening a tainted e-mail attachment. For
them, an insecure system offers seemingly endless potential.
Keeney's hard drive crash is an extreme example of what hackers can
do once inside a computer. But others can cause just as much harm
even though they come and go without leaving an immediate trace.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Sullivan said, once hackers gain entry they
can extract credit card numbers from stored files, read e-mail,
copy files, send e-mail over your name _ ``in short, just about
anything,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Most cable and DSL modems also make it easier for hackers to go
after specific computers.
</P>
<P>
   In dial-up systems, the addresses belong to the service
provider's modems, rather than to its customers. When customers
dial in for a connection, each one gets an IP address of the modem
reached for that session; each modem is associated with a finite
number of IP addresses. The next time the computer may well connect
with another modem and get another address, particularly if the
customer has a large service provider operating huge banks of
modems. ``To some extent that's security through obscurity,''
McElearney said.
</P>
<P>
   For cable-modem and DSL customers, not only are their addresses
fixed, they are also often easy to learn. The addresses appear in
the headers (which usually aren't displayed) that travel with every
e-mail message or newsgroup posting customers send.
</P>
<P>
   Many service providers have begun to respond to the problem.
Some, including Road Runner, are introducing a system that
regularly rotates their customers' IP addresses. Addresses based on
this system, however, may not change for several days and will
still appear in the headers.
</P>
<P>
   Klaus is also distressed about one unintended side effect of the
steep decline in computer prices. Inexpensive PCs increasingly mean
that some families now own several computers, all of which can be
serviced by a single high-speed line. To take advantage of that,
some people are setting up mini-networks in their homes, with one
computer acting as the go-between to the Internet for all the
others.
</P>
<P>
   The proxy server software that makes that possible, however,
often has very flawed security measures, Klaus said. To obscure
their identities, sophisticated hackers will first log into a home
network software before launching an attack against their ultimate
target. Junk-mail spammers can resort to the same trick. In either
case, the result can be highly embarrassing for the unsuspecting
home network owner, who will appear to be the originator of the
hacking or spam.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, there is not a straightforward answer to the question
of how to guarantee security while enjoying high-speed Internet
connections. For Larry Rogers, who tracks Internet security
problems at Carnegie Mellon University's CERT Coordination Center,
part of the solution is simply hard work.
</P>
<P>
   ``People with these connections need to play systems
administrator,'' he said. ``It's a matter of vigilance.''
</P>
<P>
   That vigilance can include something as simple as having Windows
users make sure that Network Neighborhood _ a file-sharing system _
is turned off. Rogers also suggested steps like regularly
downloading software security patches from Microsoft's Web site or
modifying arcane portions of the operating system. Not
surprisingly, these are just the kind of housekeeping tasks that
many users somehow never get around to.
</P>
<P>
   Some software companies are offering their help. In May,
Sybergen Networks (www.sygate.com), which mostly makes corporate
security protection software, introduced a $29.95 software package
for home users called Syshield. Similar products include Conseal
Private Desktop by Signal 9 Solutions (www.signal9.com).
</P>
<P>
   Such software generally blocks the computer from receiving some
types of data, limiting the paths in for hacker. Syshield can also
be set up to in effect disconnect the computer from the Internet
late at night.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate protection is that now used by Keeney, who has
become a computer-security consultant since his 1997 attack. He has
copied, on a much smaller scale, the system used by most
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   All his Internet business now runs on a network with a single
computer operating as a firewall and using the Linux software
system. Because it is difficult for hackers to get past the
firewall computer in such set-ups, that computer acts as a
sacrificial lamb of sorts. Keeney freely admits, however, that most
home users are unlikely to adopt such a complex setup.
</P>
<P>
   If the speculation in the industry is correct, they may never
have to. Many believe that ``security appliances'' _ extremely
stripped-down computers with security software that sit between
another computer and its Internet connection _ may eventually hit
the consumer market. Such systems for business users are already
available.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, another answer would simply be to put up with the
slow speeds and petty annoyances of a dial-in modem. But for anyone
but the more basic e-mail user, Klaus does not think that is a
great idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are too many benefits that outweigh the security risks,
provided you take precautions,'' he said. To prove his point, Klaus
added that he was now shopping for cable modem service for his
home.

`WAITING FOR APHRODITE:' A LITTLE-NOTICED WORLD OF WONDERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.) (DW) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unlike Lefty or Godot, what Sue Hubbell is referring to in the
title of her engaging new collection of essays on natural history,
``Waiting for Aphrodite: Journeys Into the Time Before Bones,'' is
neither human in form nor potentially divine.
</P>
<P>
   Her Aphrodite is instead the lowly sea mouse, named Aphrodite
aculeata (spiny Aphrodite) by the great taxonomist Linnaeus. He did
not do so, as Ms. Hubbell had assumed, because of the beauty of the
sea mouse, in her description ``an iridescent furry worm that grows
to six inches in length.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead Linnaeus, described by Ms. Hubbell as ``an unpleasant
man'' who ``often made mean jokes in his namings,'' called the sea
mouse Aphrodite to perpetuate a vulgarism, namely the supposed
resemblance of the creature to the female genitals, which, she
writes, was reflected in ``the centuries-old Northern European
slang use of the word `mouse' for a woman's sexual parts.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hubbell was waiting for her lowly Aphrodite because, as she
explains in her prologue, after years of living in Missouri she
had, on the cusp of old age, bought a house on the coast of Maine.
There, in the pools created by rock outcroppings when the tide goes
out, she began to search for the invertebrate creatures that have
always been her passion, as we know from her previous books like
``A Country Year'' ``Broadsides From the Other Orders'' and ``A
Book of Bees,'' among others.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, the 13 essays here reflect this appealing
passion. They explore such seemingly humble animals as the
millipede and the pill bug, the sponge and the earthworm, the bee
and the horseshoe crab, the spider and the fly. They take her to
the edge of her Maine coast tide pools, and into the Smithsonian
Institution's Museum of Natural History. They take her out to sea
with a New England diver for sea urchins, and up onto a walkway
through the canopy of a rain forest in Central America.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out, as is usually the case in Ms. Hubbell's diverting
books, that there is a good deal more to the beasts she focuses on
than most of us would normally notice. The golden silk spider spins
a web that researchers from Du Pont are studying in hopes of
matching its strength. Certain millipedes fall victim to one kind
of African mongoose, Mungos mungo, Ms. Hubbell writes, which picks
them up in its front paws and, ``standing, hurls them backward
between its legs at rocks, on which the hard cuticle shatters and
uncurls, allowing the mongoose to eat the soft and tasty body parts
within.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the character of earthworms, she writes, that Darwin,
while studying them for what some regard as his greatest book,
``The Formation of Vegetable Mold, Through the Action of Worms,
With Observations on Their Habits,'' came to regard them as both
intelligent and sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   Dipping deeper into the tide pools of her studies, Ms. Hubbell
draws lessons from the millions of insect species remaining to be
discovered, from the need to improve invertebrate taxonomy, from
the meaning of Darwinian evolution and from the desirability for
preserving threatened species.
</P>
<P>
   Darwin's true genius, she argues, ``was his ability to think of
time beyond ordinary human understanding and to realize that
through it small events could pile up and have big results.'' If
more of us would appreciate this, we would defend the threatened
species whose ecological value we don't yet understand, because,
she concludes, ``we don't even know the identities of a great many
pieces of the ecosystem and practically nothing about how the
totality works.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in her last chapter, a Maine fisherman presents her
with a sea mouse, and, having explored what little is known about
it, she concludes that despite the indignity of Linnaeus' having
named it ``for the goddess associated with the physicality of love
and creation,'' the ``last laugh'' belongs to the creature ``and,
perhaps, to the goddess.''
</P>
<P>
   Sea mice, it seems, belong to the oldest class of worms,
Polychaeta, a subdivision of the phylum Annelida. These worms in
their Precambrian form are now thought by zoologists to be an
important stage in the development of more complex life. It seemed
fitting to Ms. Hubbell that Aphrodite aculeata, ``an advanced and
specialized polychaete, should echo the name the Greeks gave to the
generative and creative principle that had emerged from the sea's
depths.'' After all, she points out, ``Aphrodite, the name, derives
from the Greek word for sea foam, aphros.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Ms. Hubbell writes, ``there is one curiously
non-Greek part of her story that makes using her name for our hairy
sea mouse particularly apt, and that is her aspect as Aphroditos,
noted by Aristophanes, Macrobius, Servius and others. On Cyprus,
which, as Hesiod noted, was one of her earlier stopping places, an
androgynous, hairy, bearded Aphrodite, known as Aphroditos, was
worshiped, a deity with the body and clothes of a woman but with
the beard and sexual organs of a man.''
</P>
<P>
   Aphroditos, she concludes, ``seems to have been a very ancient,
pre-Classical expression of the androgynous qualities of an
undifferentiated creative principle, of bountifulness, made
concrete as a Great Goddess with masculine traits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not bad for a six-inch fuzzy iridescent worm of ancient
lineage from the ocean deeps.''
</P>
<P>
   In this way Ms. Hubbell proceeds from her tide pool in Maine to
the Greek pantheon and beyond, or from the concrete to the
mythological and back. Along the way she reveals breathtaking
wonders. And also makes us consider the minute mechanisms making
them tick.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Poor Superman. First kryptonite, now video games. Judging from a
new Nintendo 64 cartridge named for its superhero, nothing is as
detrimental to the Man of Steel as a game controller. In a virtual
environment, Superman seems all too human.
</P>
<P>
   The game gets off to an unintentionally hilarious start when Lex
Luthor, having captured Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen, sends them
hurtling through a swirling portal into a Virtual Metropolis from
which they cannot hope to escape without Superman's help.
</P>
<P>
   ``In short time,'' he intones, ``your fate will be sealed.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the whole setup bears an uncanny resemblance to
the underground lair in ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,''
with the dais, the spiral gateway to interdimensional travel, the
hostages and, of course, Lex Luthor, who's a dead ringer for Dr.
Evil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then there's no time to waste,'' Superman says in his
hard-sell baritone. Trapped inside Virtual Metropolis, a sprawling
urban compound with conspicuous LexCorp signs, Superman's first
mission is to fly through a series of hoops floating in midair en
route to a ticking bomb.
</P>
<P>
   That's when you discover that Superman's flying controls leave
something to be desired. In the design phase, it probably sounded
like a good idea to build pitch and yaw into Superman's flight
mechanism. But in practice, it makes him really wobbly, and he
looks, well, not too confident about flying.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if you overcompensate for a steering error, Superman's
arms will reach out and flail for balance. He looks like the
Greatest American Hero, of spoofy 1980s television fame _ or George
of the Jungle in tights. Able to leap tall buildings at a single
bound? Not likely.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that you fly through all the hoops (and let's leave
aside the circus-performer indignity of that particular task),
there are a number of indoor bad-guys-in-a-maze scenarios where you
learn that Superman can die, repeatedly, before you get to the end
of a level. Not only do bullets not bounce off him, but he actually
lurches and reels when hit. His heat vision is useless in most
situations, and he can't smash through walls.
</P>
<P>
   Also, he walks funny. The lumbering gait makes sense if you
consider Superman's pigeon build and where his center of gravity
must be _ the guy's pretty top heavy. But you never see him walk in
a comic book, and in the movies or on television he's either flying
or standing still and making some kind of superhero announcement.
</P>
<P>
   So it's unsettling to see him move with the barrel-chested
inflexibility of an ex-jock, someone who's physically strong but
not particularly nimble. Something about the stiffness of his walk
is disturbingly familiar. Then suddenly, you realize that Superman
from behind looks just like Al Gore with a cape. After that, it's
hard to take him seriously.
</P>
<P>
   But even if you're 10-years-old and politically oblivious, it's
hard to take Superman seriously. In the game, Superman doesn't just
free Lois Lane. He fights off killer robots while she walks to
safety. He doesn't kill the bad guy. Oh no, he knocks out the bad
guy, lifts him aloft and carries him to a police car.
</P>
<P>
   That may work in a comic book, where the characters are
literally two-dimensional. But in 3-D, as an interactive
experience, it's a joke.
</P>
<P>
   In a video game, you have to assume the role of the central
character. But it's tough to identify with a lantern-jawed
goody-two-shoes who has no sense of humor. No one can play Superman
with a straight face. He's too simple, too earnest, too well
adjusted. He's too slow. He's used to being the strongest thing
around.
</P>
<P>
   That sense of invincibility doesn't mesh with the medium.
Because in most video games, you are surrounded by things that are
much larger and much stronger than you, things that can hurt you
badly. Even the landscape in a video game can kill you. There are
cliffs. There are ledges. There is lava.
</P>
<P>
   You're vulnerable in a video game, not just at dramatic moments
when the kryptonite comes out, but always. So video game characters
have to be agile. They can be small. They can be female. Bulk
doesn't matter. Speed matters. Coordination matters. Curiosity and
resourcefulness matter.
</P>
<P>
   The most important principle in any video game is: exploit your
surroundings. Pick up what's lying around and use it. Allocate your
energy. Manage your resources.
</P>
<P>
   And sure, it's unrealistic to assume that there will be
ammunition and first-aid kits lying around in a crisis. But it's
equally ridiculous to assume that you're the most powerful thing
around because you come from another planet.
</P>
<P>
   It's even more ridiculous in the context of this particular game
because Superman has to ``find'' X-ray vision midway through a
mission. It's just like any other power-up or weapon, and that
seriously detracts from his aura.
</P>
<P>
   Because if Superman has to scavenge for weapons, there's nothing
inherently special about him. He's just a 3-D cartoon character in
a silly outfit.
</P>
<P>
   In Virtual Metropolis, Superman is out of his element. He lacks
the reflexive grace of characters born and bred in the video game
universe so he seems befuddled and trapped.
</P>
<P>
   Chalk one up for Lex.

<P>
   They cannot take their eyes off the movie screen for more than a
few seconds. Their fingers fly through action scenes and lovingly
stroke notes from their keyboards as actors gaze into one another's
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   These musicians in the New York region are among the few
remaining practitioners of a nearly lost art: composing and
performing accompaniment for silent films.
</P>
<P>
   The job calls for intense focus, stamina and a genuine love for
these old movies, said Steve Sterner of Manhattan, who has
performed at the Film Forum in the South Village for about 15
years. Sterner, 48, plays for series there about 30 days a year.
The rest of the time he works as an actor, pianist and musical
director.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just get so wrapped up in the movie and often forget the
audience is there,'' said Sterner, who has played piano for at
least 230 films. ``But it can also take a lot out of you,
especially films that have a lot of action sequences.''
</P>
<P>
   To prepare, he screens each movie on video or in the theater;
takes pages of notes on action, characters and subjects, and
composes general themes for each. He estimates that it takes 8 to
10 hours to prepare for a show.
</P>
<P>
   During a Monday showing of ``Girl Shy,'' a hopping Harold Lloyd
film from 1924 that includes an action scene nearly 30 minutes
long, Sterner's skills were put to the test. The film is one of the
most difficult he has worked with, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chase scene is just so long, it's tough to keep up with
everything,'' he said, ``and you want to get all the falls and
effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Sterner is to play for a showing of Erich von Stroheim's
``Merry-Go-Round'' (1922) at 8 Thursday night and for Lloyd's ``For
Heaven's Sake'' (1926) at 7 and 9:55 on Monday night at the Film
Forum in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Sterner and a handful of others in New York who play music for
silent films said the best compliment they could get was to have
members of the audience say they forgot about the musician after a
while.
</P>
<P>
   ``You only want to complement the film and help the viewers get
into it, not to draw attention to yourself,'' Sterner said.
</P>
<P>
   Moviegoers said he succeeded. ``He was right there near me, and
I thought it was interesting to watch him,'' Paul Zimmerman, said.
``But after a while I was just so into the movie that he left my
field of view.''
</P>
<P>
   That reaction is one Lee Erwin likes, too. A legend in the
silent film music business, Erwin, a 90-year-old organist, has
performed in theaters across the world. He has recorded scores for
dozens of silent films _ including the works of Lloyd, Charlie
Chaplin and Buster Keaton _ in his apartment near Union Square. The
recordings were added to films and sold to theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Some silent movies had scores written for them, but for many, a
pianist or an organist composed music on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   Erwin has had his eyes on silent films and his hands on organ
keys since he was 12. His love for the movies and his musical
skills helped him become the organist at the two theaters in his
hometown, Huntsville, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the job was unpaid at first, he was happy. ``It
meant I could go in and see any movie for free,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to graduate from the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music
as he played for theaters there; then he studied in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Erwin beamed as he displayed his press clippings and pulled out
a list of 102 theaters in which he has played, as far away as
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were the great theaters at the time, and I played them
all,'' he said, pointing out places like the Carnegie Hall Cinema,
the Eighth Street Playhouse and the Bleecker Street Cinema, where
he played until the early 1980's.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many of these are gone now, just gone,'' he said, shaking
his head.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has not performed in nearly a year, in part because
of a hip injury, Erwin keeps the music alive, at least for himself.
He often sits at his piano-size Everett Orgatron and, as a film
unfolds in his mind, plays the organ without turning it on, he
said, to keep from bothering the neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   When he wants to screen a movie, he flips on the film projector
on top of his organ. During a recent visit, he had a reel of
Chaplin's ``Gold Rush'' in the projector.
</P>
<P>
   The most fun he has ever had was performing in the Halloween
silent film series at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, he
said. Last year he played his composition for Lon Chaney's
``Phantom of the Opera.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people came out, and the place was packed,'' he said.
He has also played for the cathedral's summer series of silent
films.
</P>
<P>
   He has met silent film actors and even appeared in a movie
himself once, playing a roller rink organist in Woody Allen's
``Radio Days.''
</P>
<P>
   Erwin recites his performance motto like a catechism. ``The
music is not the star,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is advice followed by many in the business, including Donald
Sosin, who has performed at the Museum of Modern Art and the
American Museum of the Moving Image. Sosin, 48, who lives in
Lakeville, Conn., said he loved the spontaneity of composing on the
spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Improvising makes the experience more special for the viewer
and more interesting for the performer,'' he said. Sosin also
performs at film festivals and works as a composer and musical
director.

   Sosin is currently in Bologna, Italy, to perform in the Cinema
Ritrovato film festival. This summer he will also be at Music
Mountain in Falls Village, Conn., and at the Telluride Festival in
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Oderman, 59, of East Orange, N.J., has been playing for
silent films for 40 years, including 30 years at the Museum of
Modern Art. He has also been writing a biography of the actress
Lillian Gish, whom he met when he skipped school to go to the
theater in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wanted to know why I wasn't in school, and I just couldn't
believe it was her,'' he said. Oderman said Gish had introduced him
to silent films and encouraged him to compose piano scores for
them.
</P>
<P>
   Another influence that pulled him into the world of silent films
was the screenings at the Museum of Modern Art. ``I just became
hypnotized when I went in there,'' he said. ``When I perform, I'm
still that 14-year-old kid cutting school and going to see movies
at the museum.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben Model, 36, of Manhattan also has performed music for silent
movies at the Museum of Modern Art. In addition, he has played for
his ``Silent Clowns'' series at the 78th Street Theater Lab, which
featured Lloyd and Chaplin films. The series closed last month and
will resume in September.
</P>
<P>
   Comedies, Model said, are great for pulling in new fans of
silent films.

THE NEW DATE CONNECTION: GROUP THERAPY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ULYSSES TORASSA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORINDA, Calif. _ Through the ages, men and women have found
diverse places to meet _ at bars, through friends, on the Internet,
at work. And now, at the shrink's.
</P>
<P>
   Orinda psychotherapist Jim Wolfe is recruiting singles through a
Web site for a new concept that is part group therapy, part
workshop and part dating service. (Which may be of particular
interest to the bachelors of Silicon Valley; a census report last
week reported that Santa Clara County has the second-biggest
surplus of single guys in the United States, after Alaska.) Called
Single Encounters, Wolfe's idea is to bring groups of eight men and
eight women together once a week for 10 weeks to get to know one
another, talk about their dating and relationship issues _ and date
one another.
</P>
<P>
   By the end, every man will have dated every woman in the group.
Sex is a no-no, at least during the 10 weeks. And whatever happens
on the date _ it can be as little as a phone call or as much as
dinner and a movie _ becomes fodder for discussions the following
week.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the dating, Wolfe insists he isn't promising people they
will find their mate in the group. That's not the idea, although he
doesn't forbid it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to give people an experience _ something they can
really work with,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not teaching people how to flirt, or giving lessons on how
to marry a millionaire,'' he added. ``It's true that if you join my
groups you will probably be going out with other people. You will
also be getting some psycho-social material around singleness,
courtship, dating and the personal baggage you bring into
relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe has seen it all _ the busy professionals too tied up in
their jobs to meet new people; those with unrealistic expectations
who dismiss potential partners because of a tiny flaw; the fear and
awkwardness in one-shot meetings; and the paucity of places where
singles can share what it's like trying to pair up.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind the group (co-led by Wolfe and a female
psychotherapist) is to let people get to know potential partners on
a deeper level before their automatic defenses kick in. And people
can be themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have a comfortable physical and emotional space to
be in,'' Wolfe said. ``You have to feel safe _ you don't have to
have your hair and makeup just right, you can just be you.
</P>
<P>
   ``You also have to have reliable information about the person.
Not the stuff they tell you after they've had three margaritas and
not the stuff in the personals where everyone is attractive and
fit.''
</P>
<P>
   In a group that gets to know one another over a period of
months, ``you find that the weird mannerisms or the personality
flaw or the strange laugh or the wry sense of humor, that when you
first hear it you think, `That guy is weird,' but when over time,
you figure that it's just that he's very smart and has a dry sense
of humor. That `flaw' becomes a characteristic, something we can
fall in love with.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe has already run two similar groups with a female
co-leader. The first, which began four years ago, continued to meet
socially for a year after the program ended. Two members of the
group also dated for three years afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a bar-hopper. I enjoy talking and meeting people,
getting to know people first, and this offered an intelligent way
of meeting people,'' said Jodie (not her real name), who joined
Wolfe's first group.
</P>
<P>
   It was also eye-opening to hear about dating from the other
side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I knew pretty much about dating, but listening to
some of these guys tell about some of their bad dates. ... I didn't
realize how hurtful it is to have someone walk away and to be
rejected. It opened my eyes to realize that men are very sensitive
creatures.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe has about 250 people signed up through his Web site who've
expressed interest. Registering is free, but if they end up
participating in a group, it costs $180.
</P>
<P>
   So far, women outnumber the men who've signed up, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a woman hears about this, she'll tell three of her
friends. But when a guy finds out about this, he'll tell nobody.
They aren't going to invite the competition. For the women, the
issue is safety _ `Let's all go together and do this.'''

BOSTON MUSEUM'S RESTRUCTURING SOWS FEAR AMONG U.S. CURATORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since Malcolm Rogers took over as its director five years ago,
the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston has been riding pretty high.
Attendance has jumped, many exhibitions have won praise, and the
museum's once-precarious finances have been shored up.
</P>
<P>
   There have been a few problems, but they have faded. Guatemala
and Mali have said that a few antiquities in the collection were
stolen from their nations, but the museum maintains that they were
acquired legally long ago, and no claims have been made in court.
And in an embarrassing moment last fall, a Monet in the museum's
blockbuster exhibition turned out to have been looted by the Nazis,
and France, which had lent the work, recently returned it to the
family that had lost it.
</P>
<P>
   But a sweeping restructuring that Rogers announced on June 25
has turned him into something of a villain to many in the art
world. He merged several departments, eliminating 18 positions and
sending two senior curators packing that afternoon. He also created
20 positions, including those of photography curator and chief
financial officer. He will add six curatorial planning and project
managers and four slots in conservation and collection management,
bringing the museum's staff to 1,043.
</P>
<P>
   The new departments, he said, are needed to improve the care and
display of the museum's collection, part of his 10-year plan to
``enhance the visitor experience.''
</P>
<P>
   But many in the art world view the restructuring differently.
``Like all of my colleagues, I'm shocked and dismayed by what has
happened,'' said William Truetter, a senior curator at the National
Museum of American Art in Washington. ``It seems like such a
takeover.''
</P>
<P>
   He and many other museum professionals see the move, which
Rogers said in a staff memo would ``transform nearly all aspects''
of the museum, as a centralization of power that devalues curators,
making them pawns to administrators who will stress bottom-line
considerations rather than intellectual content when decisions are
made on programming. They worry that other museums will follow suit
and revamp their structure, resulting in more exhibitions whose
broad public appeal is their main virtue.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Hills, an art historian at Boston University, said,
``Malcolm Rogers believes in the corporate model for a museum, with
one guy at the top who is in power making decisions and only
looking at the finances and the marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The voice of the independent curator disappears,'' she said.
``I am really concerned about the profession. Will curators be able
to be scholars or will they just be guides in a theme park?''
</P>
<P>
   Even some who accept Rogers' rationale complain that he based
his decisions on personal relationships and treated the dismissed
employees shabbily, giving them just a few hours to clean out their
desks. In a protest letter, David D. Hall, a professor of religion
at Harvard University, termed the dismissals ``vulgar and decidedly
unprofessional.'' Others, citing similar layoffs at corporations,
said they worried about morale.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, a Briton whose curatorial expertise is in British
portraiture, made no apologies. ``We handled it as well as we
possibly could,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing a different business world parallel, he said,
``Generally, restructurings are done very quickly. It's profoundly
shocking to an institution and everyone wants it done quickly.'' He
called the criticism ``inevitable when you're doing something as
radical as this.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the realignment, several independent departments that had
been organized traditionally, by art medium, have become part of
megadepartments organized geographically. The new Art of the
Americas department, for example, unites the departments of
American paintings, American decorative arts and pre-Columbian art,
while Art of Europe combines European paintings and European
decorative arts.
</P>
<P>
   Both decorative arts curators, the American expert Jonathan
Fairbanks, who had been with the museum for 28 years, and the
European expert Anne Poulet, who had worked there for 20 years,
lost their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   A new Art of Asia and Africa department joins those two
previously independent areas, and Art of the Ancient World unites
classical Greek and Roman antiquities with ancient Egyptian, Nubian
and Near Eastern art.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars and curators at other museums said that while there was
more than one good way to organize a museum's holdings, they were
surprised by the new coalitions. It is unusual to group
pre-Columbian art with American paintings and furniture, for
example, and to unite African and Asian art. These areas have
little in common and are not studied together.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said that he had used no model for the reorganization,
and that he was not concerned with what other museums do. ``I want
what's right for us,'' he said. The geographical organization will
open the way for a clear, logical layout for the museum's
collection, he explained. ``I see geography as one way to help the
visitor,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He dismissed suggestions that museum politics or frayed personal
relations led to the realignment and the dismissals. ``People will
say these things, but personalities had nothing to do with it. It's
wholly a matter of the future of the organization,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also rejected contentions that he was taking over curatorial
and programming decisions or punishing curators who were too
independent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not keen on centralizing power, but a museum needs a
central vision,'' he said. ``I see my role as setting the direction
of the museum and then providing the opportunities and resources
for curators to do great jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he expected a lot more collaboration at the museum, for
example, among departments like contemporary art, prints and
drawings, and photography, which are independent entities.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers' restructuring may also shed light on the museum's
renovation plans. In May, the museum hired the British architect
Sir Norman Foster to design a master plan for renovating its
buildings and adding a wing, but it provided no details about the
the function of the new space or how the museum's layout would
change.
</P>
<P>
   The new megadepartments send some signals. The Art of the
Americas department, for example, is big enough to fill a new
building. ``That is a good possibility, but it is by no means
certain,'' Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Rogers said, he remains confident. ``The organization
will recover very quickly,'' he said. ``The MFA is a very strong
organization and the restructuring was the right thing to do, and
most people know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert P. Henderson, the chairman of the museum's trustees, said
that the board unanimously approved the plan. ``These things were
done after a lot of thought,'' he said. ``I'm 100 percent in
favor.''
</P>
<P>
   As for critics, Rogers said, ``I ask people to watch what we
do.''

IN NORWAY, A NANNY STANDARD FOR MOVIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WALTER GIBBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSLO, Norway _ A country where violent films and videos are
banned, pornographic cinemas are nonexistent and advertisers are
forbidden to focus on children was probably not what President
Clinton had in mind this summer when he challenged Hollywood to
tone down its act.
</P>
<P>
   But for Norway, censoring entertainment is as natural as
sweeping the streets. The streets are well swept indeed. By almost
any standard, this Scandinavian capital might be considered a
bastion of wholesomeness. The police are unarmed, the children
frolic in public fountains, and the most divisive political issue
in Parliament this year is kindergarten policy.
</P>
<P>
   No one manning the cultural ramparts, however, takes Norway's
platonic order for granted, least of all a vigilant woman named
Ingeborg Moraeus Hanssen.
</P>
<P>
   A political celebrity with swirling capes and robes, Ms. Moraeus
Hanssen leads the Oslo Municipal Cinema Co., a branch of city
government that owns all 31 movie screens in the city. She must
approve every commercial film before it is shown. At stake, in her
view, is the mental health of Norwegian young people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I care much more about my public than I do about the movies,''
she said recently in her office overlooking Karl Johans Gate, the
cultural hub of Oslo. ``This industry can be very, very gruesome.
You live just once on this earth, and I don't want people wasting
their time watching stupid movies filled with violence and raw
sex.''
</P>
<P>
   As she spoke, she rapped her knuckles on her large wooden desk.
Spread before her were the day's newspapers, which had not yet
reported her latest thumbs-down ruling. The American action
thriller ``Universal Soldier: The Return,'' featuring computerized
warriors, will not be shown in Oslo because Ms. Moraeus Hanssen
considers its violence ``speculative'' and of no artistic value.
(The film is scheduled for release in the United States on Aug. 20.
)
</P>
<P>
   Last year, French film director Jan Kounen called Ms. Moraeus
Hanssen ``the lady of darkness'' for rejecting his gangster film
``Dobermann'' on the same basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could maybe happen in Iraq or China,'' Kounen thundered
to Norwegian reporters, ``but in a democratic society, such
censorship is scandalous.'' He threatened to get even by setting
his sequel, ``Dobermann II,'' in Oslo.
</P>
<P>
   Because Norway's population of 4.4 million is smaller than that
of many cities, its restrictive policies are no more than an
irritant to the film industry, which regards Norway as a throwback.
In 1980 the national authorities banned the Monty Python comedy
``Life of Brian'' because of content deemed blasphemous. In
neighboring Sweden, gleeful cinema owners ran advertisements under
the headline ``Too funny to be shown in Norway!''
</P>
<P>
   Since the Monty Python experience, Norwegian officials describe
their position on films as progressive rather than backward. They
hope that American lawmakers, shaken by a string of high school
shootings, will take steps to dam the global flow of disturbing
images in film and other media.
</P>
<P>
   Trond Waage, Norway's Cabinet-level commissioner for children,
said young people not weaned on American media lacked the
detachment and irony necessary to deal with harsh or manipulative
messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children are the holiest and best thing about our world, and
we can see they are under attack,'' he said, calling on the United
Nations to develop international media standards. He insisted that
the ``mental pollution'' emanating from entertainment capitals was
a matter of public health, not just morality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not moral,'' he said. ``I'm furious.''
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian agencies that shield children from the media admit
they are fighting a rear-guard battle. When a 5-year-old Norwegian
girl was killed roughhousing with playmates in 1994, the
action-packed American children's television series ``Mighty
Morphin Power Rangers'' got the blame and was pulled off the air.
But satellite television signals and the Internet continue to
provide forbidden fruits ranging from advertisements for children's
cereal to escapist violence and pornography.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian officials planning for the long term say schools must
give youngsters the psychological means to make healthy choices. In
the meantime the authorities joust away at perceived threats. No
private organization exists to defend artistic expression, and few
people seem to think one is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always been a control-seeking country with faith in
the authorities,'' says Tom Loeland, director general of the
Norwegian Board of Film Classification. ``Regulation is a very well
integrated part of our democracy.''`
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997 Loeland's board has banned three dozens films that
distributors wanted to import for the home-rental market. But it is
the municipal ownership of theaters, a framework unique to Norway,
that occasionally causes fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   Every town with a movie house has a public official responsible
for programming, but none have the clout of Ms. Moraeus Hanssen.
When she shuns a foreign movie it is hardly worth importing because
Oslo accounts for a third of the filmgoers in Norway. Filmmakers
around the world know of her prickliness.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I refused the movie `Crash,' David Cronenberg called me
up angry and shouting,'' she recalled, referring to the film's
director, a Canadian. ``But I am used to it. Directors always tell
me their film is a masterpiece. They say the violence is necessary.
Sometimes they even say it is funny. I love that one. Finally they
just say, `How dare you!' Well, I dare.'' (In the United States,
``Crash'' was rated NC-17: no one under 17 admitted.)
</P>
<P>
   She knows that a relationship between violent films and violent
behavior is hard to prove, she said, and she knows that youngsters
are savvy about film technology. But she also believes that they
need help to identify the good, the true and the beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am against censorship,'' she insisted. ``What I am is an
editor.''
</P>
<P>
   One of her decisions that came under scrutiny regarded Oliver
Stone's ``Natural Born Killers.'' The film board called it a social
commentary and allowed it to enter the country with an ``18''
rating limiting its audience. Ms. Moraeus Hanssen refused to
schedule it, but the outcry against censoring a potentially
historic work was so great that she gave in. She assigned the movie
to a little-known art-film house and told people not to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``That film is devil's work,'' she said. ``Oliver Stone is a
genius in many ways, but even a genius can sometimes be in the
hands of the Devil.''
</P>
<P>
   Saul Zaentz, the American producer of ``One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest,'' ``Amadeus'' and ``The English Patient,'' has never
crossed the imperious Oslo cinema director. He said her methods
would never work in the United States, but were well suited for
Norway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have known Ingeborg for many years and have always admired
her,'' he said. ``She loves what she is doing, she knows what she
is doing and she has a lot of courage. She deserves her freedom of
speech.''

BODEGA BAY DIG STIRS DEBATE ON FRANCIS DRAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CHRIS SMITH   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BODEGA BAY, Calif. _ A proposed scientific dig on the inland
shore of Bodega Head may produce the next chapter in the search for
a lost grail of Western history: the proved Pacific landfall of
globetrotter Sir Francis Drake.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever it was the English explorer sojourned in the summer of
1579 to repair and provision his flagship, the Golden Hind, he was
the first European to set foot on the place and to encounter the
natives there. Drake recorded that he left at the spot an engraved
plate claiming the territory for Queen Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
   A state parks archaeologist in Sonoma County tends to doubt the
``Drake Was Here'' plate is buried at Bodega Bay _ but he's
sufficiently intrigued by theories and a recent magnetic survey to
do some digging.
</P>
<P>
   The spot where archaeologist Breck Parkman hopes to conduct a
sample excavation is at state-owned Campbell Cove on the Bodega
Head peninsula. The spot, within yards of where Pacific Gas &AMP;
Electric Co. sought to build a nuclear power plant almost 40 years
ago, has drawn the attention of scientists and history buffs.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, a researcher piqued by the mystery of where Drake
landed on the Pacific leg of his richly successful circumnavigation
in 1577-1580, endorsed earlier proposals that the place was Bodega
Bay.
</P>
<P>
   By floating his premise, writer Brian Kelleher of Cupertino
injected himself into an impassioned, century-old debate whose
adversaries spar over whether Drake anchored at the Marin County
bay that bears his name, or in San Francisco Bay or on the Oregon
coast or at any of a score of other spots in between.
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher based his premise on a study of voyage chronicles in
which Drake described, fairly generally, the ``fit and convenient
harbor'' and the amicable Indians he and his crew encountered.
Drake stayed on for about six weeks, dubbing the region Nova
Albion.
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher's quest drew him to Bodega Bay and, more specifically,
to Campbell Cove where he searched beneath the foliage in 1997 and
came upon remnants of a stone wall he believes the Drake party may
have built during a sojourn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not uncover any definitive proof,'' he said during a
recent visit to the cove. ``I just pointed to the area. It's really
up to the archaeologists to go in and see if they can find any
artifacts there.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, researchers from the University of California
at Berkeley followed up on Kelleher's research by surveying the
site with a magnetometer, in essence a refined metal detector. Dr.
Kent Lightfoot, an archaeologist, and an assistant discovered and
plotted the locations of magnetic anomalies they said could be
archaeological artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There does seem to be something buried there,'' Lightfoot
said. Just what it might be is, at this point, anybody's guess.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are heartened by the discovery of the rock wall and
the buried magnetic anomalies, and not just because of the prospect
they may have been left by Drake.
</P>
<P>
   With or without Drake, the spot is historically significant,
because the Coast Miwok lived there, and in the early 1800s _ more
than two centuries after Drake's voyage _ Russian fur traders built
a warehouse and other structures at Campbell Cove.
</P>
<P>
   No extensive archaeological study has ever been done at the
place. Parks archaeologist Parkman said Kelleher's investigation
and the survey by Lightfoot justify a sample dig. Parkman is
pursuing a $10,000 project to hand-dig an exploratory excavation.
He said he hopes to start the dig later this year or early in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's unlikely it's Drake's site,'' he said, ``but I
sure wouldn't be disappointed if it is. It would be nice finally to
solve that mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   The mystery matters to historians and archaeologists because
Drake was a giant of his time, his accomplishment similar in scale
to Neil Armstrong's stepping onto the moon more than 400 years
later.
</P>
<P>
   Drake's expedition was the second circumnavigation of the globe,
coming about 50 years after the voyages of Portuguese-born
Ferdinand Magellan. Drake left England in December of 1577 with
five ships, only one of which _ the Golden Hind _ would complete
the 36,000-mile journey.
</P>
<P>
   He filled the holds with silver he plundered from Spanish ships
and settlements in what would become Chile and Peru. When he
reached the area of Northern California in June 1579, he needed a
safe place to wait out late-season Pacific storms, repair his
leaking ship and take on provisions.
</P>
<P>
   From the Pacific Coast, Drake sailed to Indonesia, then across
the Indian Ocean, around Africa's Cape of Good Hope and north to
England. Delighted by his victories over the Spanish and the
astounding piles of silver he delivered to her treasury, Queen
Elizabeth bestowed knighthood on the first Englishman to sail
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   That brass plate he left somewhere, be it at Campbell Cove or
wherever, is a treasure of historical proportion, if only it can be
found.

AS PLAIN AS THE `NOSE' ON YOUR CHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By PETER WAYNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the senses, the realm of smell remained relatively
mysterious and unexplored by technology until very recently. Now
scientists and engineers are beginning to build electronic noses,
and the race is on to create palm-size machines and find
applications for them.
</P>
<P>
   Smell has been hard for scientists to understand. Physicists
created good mathematical models of how light, touch and sound
affect the human body many hundreds of years ago. But imitating the
human nose is a much harder job.
</P>
<P>
   What is needed is a device that can first detect specific
chemicals, then decipher the often complex combinations of
chemicals that occur in nature and finally come up with the same
answer that the human brain does.
</P>
<P>
   It is now easy for scientists to identify chemicals like methane
or benzene, but it's much harder to fit them into a map of the
specific odor of a hog farm or a dry cleaner. Even something so
seemingly simple as vanilla extract can be a deep mystery, a
complex potion of chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   The new digital noses are a departure from the traditional
technique of isolating individual chemicals with expensive devices,
like gas chromatographs and mass spectrometers, that excel at
revealing the individual components of a compound.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Sunshine, the president of Cyrano Sciences, a company in
Pasadena, Calif., that has developed an electronic nose on a chip,
said in a telephone interview, ``What we're really doing is
developing a very simple chemical analysis technique. The phrase
`electronic nose' is a good descriptor, but it's not always
complete.''
</P>
<P>
   Cyrano's chip has 32 sensors wired to it, each with a different
polymer mixed with some conducting material. As the chip is exposed
to the various gases that make up an odor, different polymers
expand, changing the pattern of conductivity on the chip. A
computer then measures the pattern and compares it with that of the
patterns of known samples to determine the odor.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is coming up with 32 polymers that react differently
to a wide range of chemicals. Some polymers may be impervious to
water but very sensitive to hydrocarbons like butane or methane.
Others may be tuned to aromatic chemicals like naphthalene, a
component in mothballs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our approach is much more like the human nose approach,''
Sunshine said. ``When you go around smelling, your nose isn't
trying to figure out the components of what you're smelling. It's
making a decision on a pattern recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   Each sensor reacts with a wide variety of chemicals, and it is
not possible to pinpoint the exact gas setting off each sensor.
That limitation may prove acceptable to many users because the
traditional tools for analyzing chemicals _ like the gas
chromatographs and mass spectrometers _ can easily cost tens if not
hundreds of thousands of dollars. Sunshine predicted that Cyrano's
device would cost about $5,000 when it was introduced at the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Evor L. Hines, a scientist at the University of Warwick in
England, is studying how to use a computer simulating a neural
network to aid in pattern recognition. Hines recently reported that
he and his colleagues had developed the ability to chart the
progress of bananas from green to overripe, identifying the
freshness of the fruit automatically.
</P>
<P>
   The neural network monitors how each of the different sensors in
an electronic nose reacts to a new smell and compares the results
with sensor readings in previous encounters. The network is able to
distinguish between smells if it can identify simple differences in
how the sensor array responds.
</P>
<P>
   That may be easy with smells based on very different chemicals,
but it can require subtle distinctions when the chemicals are
similar but present in slightly different amounts.
</P>
<P>
   Sunshine said the latest experiments at Cyrano suggested that
the company's digital nose excelled at some problems, like
distinguishing between the smoke from different types of fires.
People are often overwhelmed by the smoke and don't pick up some of
the subtler differences, he said. That may prove useful in
fire-detection and analysis.
</P>
<P>
   He admitted that his electronic nose could not match the human
nose in some areas, like detecting the sulfur compounds inserted
into natural gas to warn people if there is a leak.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Diane Ackerman, the author of ``A Natural History of the
Senses'' (Random House, 1990) said she was intrigued by the new
technology. ``We need to get used to sharing our sensory awareness
with computers,'' she said. ``This doesn't alarm me because in a
sense human beings aren't just evolving in the usual way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ackerman said the technology would eventually extend the
range of human smell in the same way that microscopes and
binoculars extended people's vision.
</P>
<P>
   She predicted that the electronic nose would come in handy in
diagnosing disease. Doctors often use their sense of smell
(discreetly) to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems rude to have doctors sniffing around you,'' Ms.
Ackerman said. But she predicted that the electronic nose might
provide some neutral scientific basis for comparing smells.
</P>
<P>
   The electronic nose developers are already exploring the
potential of the medical market. ``We've done some work on sniffing
a cow's breath,'' Hines said. ``We were actually involved in a
collaborative project to determining the state of health of the
dairy cattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Humans are next.

HEALTH ALERT: STOP WATCHING MARTHA STEWART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Friday, July 9)  
(mk) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's blonde, perky and makes you want to throw your remote
control through the TV screen?
</P>
<P>
   Too easy. Martha Stewart, of course.
</P>
<P>
   According to an Illuminations survey, 27 percent of TV viewers
say they are ``stressed'' by watching the evening news compared to
51 percent who are stressed by watching Martha Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   The alarming part of this survey, in my mind, is not that more
people would rather see bodies being dug out of the rubble of
Belgrade than watch Martha assemble a homemade Christmas wreath of
dried herbs and wildflowers. The alarming part is that 49 percent
of TV viewers are apparently able to watch Martha without diving
for the whiskey bottle or curling up in the fetal position in a
dark, quiet corner of the house.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure that the Martha Stewart phenomenon is something men
can comprehend. For us, it's just something we flip past while
looking for Sportscenter or a bass-fishing show. If Martha wants to
reel in the male demographic, she needs to teach us how to cast for
bonefish.
</P>
<P>
   My wife and mother both watch Martha Stewart and neither, from
what I've observed, derive any pleasure from the experience. After
watching Martha single-handedly rescreen her windows and plant a
half-acre vegetable garden in less than half an hour, my mother is
too tired to go grocery shopping or pick up her prescriptions from
the pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
   The Illuminations survey does not specify how many elderly women
have been deprived of their medication because Martha was
reshingling the roof while simultaneously cooking a formal dinner
for 12 that day on TV, but you've got to think it's a significant
number. I would suggest that Congress look into this but I'm afraid
that their solution would be to require that TV screens be covered
with copies of the Ten Commandments, which would make watching
baseball difficult.
</P>
<P>
   But exhaustion and dangerous medical side-effects are
preferable, in some ways, to what my wife feels while watching
Martha Stewart _ an overwhelming sense of guilt. Such is the power
of Martha that women who work at a job 10 hours a day, haul the
kids to soccer and ballet practice, do the laundry, cook the meals
and clean the house still find themselves feeling ... inadequate.
After all, Martha's hair is fluffed, there are no bags under her
eyes and she tie-dyes her T-shirts with dyes made from organic,
individually labeled vegetables grown in her garden, the corners of
which are marked by handmade plaster statues of Sumerian fertility
gods.
</P>
<P>
   I know my wife has been watching too much Martha Stewart when I
find little jars with dried rose petals sitting around the house
and she announces, without a trace of sarcasm, that it might be
``fun,'' at our next party, to float candles in the punch bowl. (I
have learned not to mention the fact that we do not even own a
punch bowl as this just makes her feel worse about herself.)
</P>
<P>
   I know that my wife is reaching dangerous levels of
Martha-Stewart-related stress when she individually buffs lettuce
leaves with a linen napkin before serving them in a salad and
starts trimming the hedge to resemble the Seven Dwarfs.
</P>
<P>
   The only known cure is to strap her in a chair and make her
watch several hours of bass fishing shows with a little baseball
highlights thrown in for ``dessert.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a drastic treatment, to be sure, but it beats coming home
and finding her making wind chimes out of hand-painted coconut
shells.

 By MICHEL MARRIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shortly after 2 a.m. on a Sunday last January, my wife and baby
daughter, and even the cat curled up at my feet, were asleep. But I
could not have been more awake.
</P>
<P>
   For hours I had been hunched over the dining room table, trying
to turn $700 worth of discount electronic components into the core
of what would be my new personal computer. I had no intention of
stopping until I had realized a shimmering, silicon dream: a
machine packing no less than a 400-megahertz chip with 128
megabytes of memory; a 10.8-gigabyte hard drive; DVD-ROM,
CD-rewritable and Zip drives, plus a 19-inch monitor, the geek's
equivalent of a muscle car.
</P>
<P>
   The early morning quiet was broken only by the prattle of the
nearby television and the sound of my voice reciting a checklist
before plugging in the partly complete computer for its first test.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after an imaginary drumroll, I pressed the computer's
On button and waited.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing: no blinking lights, no whirling cooling fans, not a
solitary beep. With a rising sense of panic, I unplugged the PC to
wiggle its wires and examine its components.
</P>
<P>
   Was the motherboard secure and properly grounded? Were all the
jumpers on the motherboard and hard drive in their correct
positions? Were the microprocessor and memory modules firmly
seated? I even sniffed for signs of electrical overheating.
</P>
<P>
   I tried the machine again, and once again: nothing. Exhausted, I
went to bed.
</P>
<P>
   This was one step on the winding yet often exhilarating climb to
constructing my own computer at home. From December to May, I
carefully acquired computer parts, watching for bargains and
comparing notes with build-your-own veterans. My wife was
skeptical, while most of my friends and colleagues had a common
response _ why?
</P>
<P>
   The answer wasn't simple. First, as a lifelong tinkerer, I was
fascinated by computers. After years of frequently upgrading my IBM
PS/2 to its design limits, I was no longer intimidated by a
computer's inner workings. And since that computer was six years
old, I was ready for a new one, but as I shopped around, I could
never quite find the perfect fit. There was always some device I
would have to add, or some part of it I would rather discard. Given
the price for the higher-end machines, around $2,800 to $3,400 late
last year, the thought of buying my own parts at discount prices
and spreading the cost out over months was intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   There were risks, however. I knew that My home-built PC, if it
worked at all, would not have any technical support and that
warranties would cover only individual parts, not the assembled
no-brand PC. And I knew I could forget the hundreds of megabytes of
free software, often preloaded, that customarily come bundled with
retail computers.
</P>
<P>
   And if I took too long to build the PC, it could start to show
its age before it even ran because of faster and more feature-laden
parts and devices coming to market. But the allure of making a
computer outweighed the cold practical concerns. The birth of home
computers 25 years ago can be traced to hobbyists who were eager to
show off their prowess with garage-made machines. The Altair 8800,
the first mass market PC, was sold as a kit.
</P>
<P>
   From upgrading experiences years ago, I knew that I could leave
the soldering iron in the tool box. Unlike those first PCs,
computers today are not so much built as they are assembled,
requiring little more than a screwdriver.
</P>
<P>
   Few if any computer makers build all the parts they need to
complete a computer. Many manufacturers produce hard drives, sound
cards and motherboards. That makes PC parts amazingly modular and
fairly interchangeable. (Macintosh computers, of course, are the
exception.) All the really hard work, like cramming millions of
microscopic transistors onto the thin slips of silicon, has been
done by the technicians. The components themselves snap into place
like Legos.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, standards vary, and not all computer parts
work well together even if they fit together. Some are downright
incompatible. Worse, there are few ways to tell which parts and
devices are incompatible until you try to get them to work together
in the same computer.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Migliore, a consultant based in Englewood, N.J., has built
a house full of computers in the last four years. But after a
recent run of compatibility problems, he is growing less
enthusiastic about do-it-yourself PCs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you start to calculate the cost of the endless hours that
go into it and the emotional strain, it adds up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   You can avoid most problems if you are experienced, pay
attention to word-of-mouth cautions and study the specifications of
retail computers. There is also something to be said for taking
your time.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   I made lists of likely key components: motherboards,
microprocessors, memory modules and hard drives. When I went
shopping, my first stop was at a sprawling computer show held at
the New Jersey Convention and Exposition Center in Edison, N.J., in
late December. A sharp eye can find top-notch computer parts and
devices like speaker systems at discounts of 30 percent to 50
percent, compared with the retail prices commonly found in computer
and electronics stores.
</P>
<P>
   The two microprocessors I was looking at the time were Intel's
Pentium II 400-MHz and 450-MHz chips and Advanced Micro Devices
K6-2 400-MHz chip with 3-D Now _ the two leading chip brands at the
time. As a PC user since the mid-1980s, I have learned that the
latest thing is not always the greatest thing. Performance gains
are usually not nearly as great as the increase in the price would
suggest. Plus, the price of a chip almost always drops
significantly after a slightly faster one comes out. And I knew
that in three months or so there would be a bigger, better chip
anyway (the Pentium III 500-MHz and 550-MHz chips and the AMD K6-3s
450-MHz and 500-MHz chips).
</P>
<P>
   I decided on the AMD 400-MHz chip after the saleswoman, who had
the attention span of a toddler as dozens of potential customers
clamored for her chips, showed it to me in a jeweler's case, as if
it were worth its weight in gold (the actual chip is worth more).
The processor has an excellent reputation, and its price, $220, was
well under its Intel counterpart's. And it fit on a socket 7
motherboard, the most common configuration of main circuit boards
that PCs use. The more common the board, my thinking went, the
greater chance I would have of finding one with exactly the
features I needed.
</P>
<P>
   The motherboard, also called the main board, is the foundation
of any computer. Everything in the computer connects in some way to
the motherboard, which manages everything. A few weeks before I
went shopping for parts, I took some build-it-yourself classes
offered at my office so I could better understand the motherboard.
The instructor, Darrell Thomas, recommended buying a motherboard
that had plenty of expansion slots. The more slots a motherboard
has, especially the newer 32-bit PCI slots, the more circuit boards
or cards you can add to the PC to give it things like exceptional
sound, graphics and Internet connectivity. The same can be said for
special DIMM slots, which hold 168-pin computer memory modules.
More memory almost always translates into better computer
performance.
</P>
<P>
   I got a ASUS brand motherboard designed to run with a AMD K6-2.
It had every feature I was looking for and appeared to be very easy
to work with. The chip and board together cost $355. For another
$10, I got a heat-sink (a device that draws heat away from the
chip) and processor-fan combination that locks to the top of the
chip to help keep it cool.
</P>
<P>
   For days I carried the instruction booklet that came with the
motherboard with me as if it were a great novel. I read and reread
it on the bus, in the subway, over lunch. Of key importance was
setting the motherboard's jumpers, tiny switches that tell the
computer things like what kind of microprocessor it will work with.
</P>
<P>
   I was on my way. At the same computer fair, I bought a snazzy
mid-tower case with a 220-watt power supply for $60 at another
vendor's stand. I preferred a tower over a horizontal cabinet
because towers have more room for expansion, and the one I bought
features a pull-out chassis that makes the PCs components easy to
reach for repairs and future installations.
</P>
<P>
   For $16 I bought a Sony 1.44-MB floppy disk drive and 64
megabytes of Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (today's
standard kind of memory modules) _ an amount I would double before
May. In the next several months, I went to computer fairs twice. I
also visited major computer retail outlets like CompUSA (when I got
impatient between fairs) and computer boutiques, looking for sales.
</P>
<P>
   When my PC had failed to come on in January, I retraced my steps
and discovered that I had not properly plugged all the controls
into the motherboard. After fixing that, I added a DVD-ROM and
100-MB Iomega internal Zip drive to my PC. Around Valentine's Day,
I reworked the control plugs that connect the motherboard to the
control buttons on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Then I held my breath and tried to test the computer yet again.
Almost immediately, lights flickered and I heard the hum of cooling
fans inside. There was also the familiar mechanical cranking up
sound of the hard drive. It was running. I wrote two words in my
project journal that morning: ``Very exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   I let the computer run all night to check for problems. I moved
it to the bedroom dresser so I could peek from bed at its green and
red lights throughout the night. I also wanted to be close enough
so I could smell trouble (literally) if it flared up.
</P>
<P>
   There were problems, all minor ones, with my new PC along the
way. I learned the hard way that I had to replace all the internal
ribbon cables with longer ones so the chassis could actually be
pulled out more than a couple of inches.
</P>
<P>
   And just when I was ready to buy my first choice for a powerful
graphics card, I found out that it would not work in my
motherboard's accelerated graphics port, or AGP, a too common
problem with some socket 7 motherboards. So I had to opt for a
PCI-slot graphics card, thereby using a valuable slot that could
have been used for something else. The following weekend, using
software and other parts from my old IBM, like its keyboard and
mouse and 15-inch monitor, I began loading software into my new PC.
First came the operating system, Windows 98. Its Plug and Play
function quickly recognized all the devices I had previously added
to the PC, like the DVD-ROM and CD-R drives and 56K modem.
</P>
<P>
   Right away I was impressed by the speed and power of my new PC.
Programs could be installed on it in less time than it took for my
old PC to notice that it was being asked to install a program.
</P>
<P>
   In the next couple of months, I added more software, a cordless
keyboard and mouse for about $100. For $200, I added a three-way
surround-sound speaker system with a subwoofer almost as big as a
microwave oven. Finally, on the first day of May, I bought a
19-inch monitor for my new PC and gave my old IBM to my wife.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One thing did concern me. When I checked my microprocessor's
temperature, I noticed that it occasionally inched upward to 120
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Heat is the great destroyer of computer parts. A friend who was
building a computer for his wife told me that he had become so
worried that his PC could overheat that he dreamed about his
450-MHz chip and saw it melt like grilled cheese.
</P>
<P>
   I eventually grew so concerned that I called a troubleshooter
for AMD. He told that the company's 400-MHz chips run safely at
temperatures approaching 130 degrees. Still, I headed off any
potential problem by redesigning the ventilation system. I added
two large cooling fans inside the PC case and arranged them so they
pushed hot air out of the case.
</P>
<P>
   On May 1, six months after I started, my computer was finally
complete. It routinely runs powerful graphics programs for
collecting and editing images made by my digital camera. It plays
the latest DVD-ROM full-length, high-resolution films, as well as
the latest games and electronic encyclopedias without a hitch. And
it backs up all my vital programs and data on rewritable CD-ROMs _
all impossible on my old PC.
</P>
<P>
   Now I'm designing a logo for the empty spot in the middle of its
case. I've christened it the Drumtec-400, in honor of the first
mass communications device and denoting the clock speed of its
processor.
</P>
<P>
   In all, I spent about $2,400 for my homemade PC. I estimate that
if I had purchased a similar PC at the time I started, it would
have cost about $500 more. Because prices have continued to fall on
the parts and devices, I could build the same computer now for
about $1,800.
</P>
<P>
   It was money well spent. Each time I turn on my computer, I'm
filled with pride and that feeling best expressed by Arthur C.
Clarke when he said that ``any sufficiently advanced technology is
indistinguishable from magic.''
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, when I visit computer stores I no longer have to
wince when I look at minimum requirements for software that
interests me. My PC runs everything, so far. But then, as sure as
rain follows thunder, there will be newer computers with faster
microprocessors for even more demanding programs. As soon as it was
built, my new PC started on the road to obsolescence. I'm already
plotting possible upgrades for years to come _ a new motherboard
with even more PCI slots, a Fire Wire (IEEE) port for digital video
editing, perhaps a huge flat-panel monitor when they become a lot
less expensive and, of course, a new miracle microprocessor.
</P>
<P>
   So I suppose PCs are never truly finished. Please don't tell my
wife.
</P>
<P>
   (STORY ENDS HERE. OPTIONAL SIDEBARS FOLLOW)
</P>
<P>
   PC CONSTRUCTION TIPS
</P>
<P>
   Building a personal computer can be a fool's errand if you don't
plan your work and work to your plan. Here are some things to
remember before you start to build.
</P>
<P>
   YOUR NEEDS _ Determine what kinds of demands you are likely to
make on the computer before you start to buy parts. If the new PC
is primarily going to be used for simple word processing and
surfing the Internet the types of components needed could be quite
different from those required for a PC that is designed to run
games or business applications.
</P>
<P>
   THE CPU _ Shop carefully, starting with the single most
important piece _ the microprocessor (also called the central
processing unit or CPU). Next decide on a good motherboard that
will accommodate the CPU. That information can usually be found on
the packaging and certainly in its manual.
</P>
<P>
   PORTS _ Make sure the motherboard has at least two Universal
Serial Bus ports, important for using a slew of new devices like
high speed printers and scanners.
</P>
<P>
   CASING _ Select a case, which usually comes with a power
transformer to run the computer. Vertical cases, or towers, offer
many advantages over horizontal cases. Towers are generally larger
so they can hold more devices and are more accessible for repair
and upgrades. All cases are configured in one of two types: AT and
ATX. This has more to do with the power supplies and how they
connect to the motherboard. Make sure that the motherboard's
connector matches the case. Some motherboards have connectors for
both AT and ATX.
</P>
<P>
   Make certain the case also has enough bays, compartments for
devices like CD-ROM drives.
</P>
<P>
   MEMORY _ Besides the CPU and motherboard every PC requires
memory chips (32 megabytes minimum of SDRAM), a hard drive for
storage (4.3 gigabytes minimum although 10 GB makes more sense with
today's bloated programs) and some form of drive, usually two. That
can mean, for example, a floppy disk drive and a CD-ROM drive or a
DVD-ROM that can play DVD movies, data disks, CD-ROM's and audio
compact disks. Popular CD-rewritable, Zip and tape backup drives
are optional.
</P>
<P>
   EXPANSION ROOM _ Remember to always leave room for future
upgrades. Motherboards with at least four more slots, (32-bit PCI
slots are better than aging 16-bit ISA slots) are better than those
with fewer. More slots may cost a little more but the expenditure
will save you in grief later.
</P>
<P>
   PRECAUTIONS _ Handle your components carefully, trying not to
touch exposed circuitry. Hold them by their edges like
old-fashioned vinyl records. Also make sure you are grounded. That
can be accomplished by touching the unplugged power supply before
you touch components or by wearing a anti-static wrist band.
</P>
<P>
   KITS _ If you are feeling less adventuresome, mail-order PC kits
are available from companies like Tiger Direct in Miami that
include everything you need to build a computer, including assembly
instructions and proven parts. Monitors are seldom included,
however.
</P>
<P>
   Parts at Bargain Prices
</P>
<P>
   So you want to build a computer?
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, you will need reliable parts. In recent years, most
reputable computer stores have stocked just about everything a
computer builder needs. The downside is that you will be expected
to pay full retail prices unless the items you want are on sale.
</P>
<P>
   On the Web, services like eShopper ( &UR; www.eshopper.com &LR; )
routinely sell a wide range of computer parts, often at discounted
prices. There are also a number of online auction Web sites on
which computer parts, some used or refurbished, are frequently for
sale at reduced prices.
</P>
<P>
   At weekend computer fairs, computer components are sold like
secondhand watches. Many parts, in addition to monitors and
printers, are sold for as low as 30 to 50 percent of manufacturers'
suggested retail prices at computer fairs. But caution is advised.
While some parts may be heavily discounted because they are from
earlier generations, some components _ particularly among those
sold as OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) without retail
packaging _ have been found to be refurbished without the buyer's
knowledge and others are outright counterfeits.
</P>
<P>
   KGP Productions puts on some of the biggest computer fairs in
the United States, mostly along the East Coast. A schedule of shows
can be found at www.pcshow.com.
</P>
<P>
   No matter where parts are purchased make sure to get receipts
with the sellers' addresses and telephone numbers. Be clear about
the return and refund arrangements. And if you are buying at a
computer fair, run the component (at least all night if possible)
as soon as you can. If a problem develops you will have a better
chance of finding the vendor before the fair closes and leaves town
_ with your money.
</P>
<P>
   _ By MICHEL MARRIOTT
</P>
<P>
   HELPFUL PUBLICATIONS
</P>
<P>
   Determining the reliability and features of computer parts can
be tricky. One way is to read reviews of them in computer
publications like PC Computing, Maximum PC and PC Novice magazines;
another is to ask around at computer enthusiast Web sites or to ask
computer vendors and users whose judgment you trust.
</P>
<P>
   Since building a computer often means doing the job without an
instruction manual _ individual components and drives usually
include instructions only on their installation _ it could be
helpful to know the overall design of a personal computer and how
all the parts work together. The following books provide helpful
information for anyone planning to build a computer.

IT'S THE LAND OF THE FREE (COMPUTER) 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
(jt) 
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Swept up in the phenomenal rush of the global Internet that it
helped create, the personal computer industry is undergoing a
fundamental transformation.
</P>
<P>
   The PC has become inextricably linked to the Internet, causing
the two formerly distinct businesses to blend. Several PC makers
have begun offering free Internet access as an inducement to sell
more machines, while several Internet service providers have begun
giving away computers, or subsidizing their purchase, to entice
more customers to sign up for online services.
</P>
<P>
   Still another group of companies has started giving computers to
customers who agree to look at online advertising. The companies
hope that they can attract advertisers who are trying to reach a
population that is spending less time in front of the TV and more
time in front of the PC.
</P>
<P>
   The personal computer, which gained popular acceptance in the
1980s for its ability to perform a wide variety of business and
scientific tasks, is increasingly being recognized in the late
1990s as primarily a communications device that enables anyone to
send and receive e-mail, participate in discussion groups and
browse for information on the Internet's World Wide Web. Marketing
surveys confirm that Internet access is the main reason people buy
a PC today.
</P>
<P>
   And now, the PC is following the model of the cellular phone,
which is often given away or sold at low cost to customers who sign
up for service contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the largest Internet service providers, America
Online's Compuserve unit, the Microsoft Network and Prodigy
Internet, now offer $400 rebate programs that cover at least part
of the cost of a new PC.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, several of the largest PC makers, including Compaq,
Dell and Gateway, are driving the cost of their basic computers
well below $1,000 and experimenting with free Internet access to
get more customers.
</P>
<P>
   Best Buy, CompUSA, Microcenter and Circuit City are among the
large national retailers that are offering similar deals in
conjunction with Internet service contracts, making the cost of a
PC comparable to the cost of, say, a video cassette recorder.
During test marketing at some stores, they have offered weekend
specials: a PC for $400, with a $400 instant rebate. Circuit City
offered a bundle of a monitor and printer for $99 extra.
</P>
<P>
   There is no such thing as a free lunch, of course, and caveats
abound in these new schemes. There are no complete PC systems
available for $400, and the PC's that come closest are typically
bare-bones machines with minimal features, dubious warranties and
limited free technical support. The offers typically do not apply
to Apple Macintosh computers or PC companion devices like the Palm
Pilot. The Internet service contracts require payments of $700 or
more over three years, and if the customer gets frustrated by the
quality of the PC or the Internet service during that time, three
years is a very long time to stew.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there is no doubt that these programs make
owning a PC and getting connected to the Internet much less
expensive than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a customer can buy a $399 Emachines PC with
Compuserve software already installed, sign up for a three-year
Compuserve account at $21.95 a month and get a $400 rebate check
from America Online. The Emachines computer does not come with a
monitor, which adds $100 or so. And while Compuserve is owned by
America Online, it lacks the strong lineup of family and
child-friendly features that have made AOL the world's most popular
online service.
</P>
<P>
   Prodigy, once the largest online service in America before it
fell on hard times, this month announced a rebate plan with the
Best Buy Co., the country's largest consumer PC retail chain. A
customer who signs a three-year contract for Prodigy Internet
access at $19.95 a month will get a $400 rebate that can be applied
to the cost of any desktop or portable PC at Best Buy. A two-year
contract will get a $250 rebate; a one-year plan, $100.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft Network, or MSN, is testing a $400 rebate plan in
15 Microcenter computer stores, and last weekend it conducted a
limited ``free PC'' test with Staples office products stores. Like
the others, MSN requires a three-year commitment at $19.95 a month.
Microcenter has a $449 PC, but it does not include a monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq offers free Internet access with its Presario line of
home computers, including one model that costs $599 with a monitor,
through a rapidly growing Internet service company called Net Zero.
Net Zero requires customers to reveal personal information and to
agree to watch advertisements geared to their interests. Compaq
also offers Internet access under its own Compaq.net service for
prices starting at $11.99 per month.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway offers one year of free Internet access with any machine
priced over $1,000 and is said to be negotiating to buy Earthlink,
a major Internet service company.
</P>
<P>
   Global demand remains strong for powerful and expensive PC's
that can perform complex operations like managing large customer
accounts, designing software or playing the latest
three-dimensional computer games. But in the past year, consumers
have come to see PC's _ especially those that cost less than $1,000
_ mainly as the boxes that say ``You've Got Mail!'' and allow them
to buy books, trade stocks and participate in electronic garage
sales and auctions without leaving home.
</P>
<P>
   Although low-cost PC's are not suitable for designing rocket
ships or playing the latest 3-D games, most are more than adequate
for handling simple applications like e-mail, Web browsing and
online shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, PC's appealed mainly to consumers who were
technologically adept or brave enough to put up with such a
notoriously complex, frustrating and expensive device. The
penetration of PC's into American homes reached about 40 percent,
then stayed there for several years, suggesting that most people
who wanted a PC already had one.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has changed the landscape. The superiority of
e-mail over postal mail for keeping in touch with friends and
family, coupled with the ubiquity of ``www'' Internet addresses on
television and in print advertisements, is piquing the interest of
many consumers who until now had resisted owning a computer. They
may still hate the idea of having a computer, but they love the
idea of being on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   With their new ``free PC'' plans, the Internet companies are
hoping to reach many of the 45 million American households that
have lacked either the interest or the money to bring PC's into
their homes. The ``free Internet'' schemes of the PC makers are
heading toward the same goal from the opposite route.
</P>
<P>
   If the most optimistic forecasts come true, computers may soon
become as ubiquitous as telephones or television sets. For that to
happen, PC's are going to have to be as easy to use as telephones
and television sets, which is definitely not the case today.
</P>
<P>
   But the price is right, finally.

MAKING BOOKS: ON THE BEACH WITHOUT TOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is the summer of no Tom Clancy novel, and one would have
thought that publishers of that loosely defined genre, men's action
fiction, would have stocked the bookstores with contenders.
Surprisingly, they haven't. One publisher said that everyone was
afraid of Hannibal Lecter, a genre unto himself, who is loose again
atop the best-seller lists.
</P>
<P>
   Well, in publishing it is the summer of Hannibal. And just as
one big movie can scare away competing studios, one big novel can
send every publisher scurrying for cover.
</P>
<P>
   But that's no excuse for the lack of thrillers this season,
since few in publishing knew, when they were scheduling their
summer lists, that Hannibal Lecter would be uncaged again now.
Still, for whatever reason, this Clancyless summer also has no new
James Patterson, Nelson DeMille, W.E.B. Griffin. (There is a new
best-selling Clive Cussler, a paperback from Pocket written with a
co-author.)
</P>
<P>
   So the question is, where do Clancy's guys go when there's no
Clancy novel? (One can ask the same of John Grisham readers,
although he apparently has as many women fans as men.)
</P>
<P>
   And even though these male beach novels are the simplest form of
drama _ guns and death being their main elements _ it has become
increasingly hard to break out new authors in the genre. In part,
that is because each action novel is so much a different version of
essentially the same story, and, moreover, the end of the Cold War
meant the end of interesting bad men: Soviet Communists.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some publishers are using this summer to try to establish
a few fresh male adventure writers. Bantam Books has popped back to
World War II, with ``War of the Rats,'' a second novel by David L.
Robbins. It is a compelling, horrific story of the Battle of
Stalingrad as told from the point of view of two snipers, one
Russian, one German, precision killers hunting each other. It went
on sale this week.
</P>
<P>
   Irwyn Applebaum, the book's publisher, said: ``Male action
readers in most of the '90s had Clancy as a summer read. This year
there's not a new Clancy. We certainly hope `War of the Rats' will
be a big summer vacation read. When we got the pitch, we asked
ourselves, `Who in America is going to read a World War II novel
not about Americans but about Germans and Stalingrad?' But it works
at the level of an exciting novel, and it has what few novels,
especially war novels have: real characters who stand out on the
page.''
</P>
<P>
   Bantam is going all out to make Robbins a brand name. His novel
will have a first printing of about 35,000 copies, and the
publisher is putting an ambitious display in bookstores in which a
copy of the book is set in a cardboard model of a Stalingrad
street, with a blinking red light to represent a sniper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It still comes down to publishing a book, sometimes what seems
like an impossible book, in which people want to turn to the next
page,'' Applebaum said, ``If it's a a good story, they'll read
about anything.'' Which shows that publishing is still an exercise
of hope in a chaotic world.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Romanos, the president of Simon &AMP; Schuster's trade
division, says that the readership for such adventure novels had
for the moment ``reached a plateau,'' but that if ``you have a
great adventure with good good guys and good bad guys, there are
still great opportunities for such books to work.'' This week
Pocket, a division of Simon &AMP; Schuster, published Vince Flynn's
``Transfer of Power.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very much a Tom Clancy-like, Washington-based thriller,
that we deliberately scheduled when there was no new Clancy
novel,'' Romanos said.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner Trade Publishing is also using this summer to
promote some newer writing talent. Laurence Kirshbaum, the house's
chief executive, said: ``Breaking out new acts is becoming tougher
and tougher. Our brand-name authors want to hug that rail around
Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Warner has ``Thunderhead,'' by Douglas Preston and
Lincoln Child, out in July, and a first novel, ``The Pledge,'' by
Rob Kean, scheduled for August, with a substantial 75,000 first
printing.
</P>
<P>
   Action books for men are descended from the old pulp magazines
featuring detective stories and western tales, and in general they
have followed an evolutionary line from war novels to Mickey
Spillane to James Bond adventures to Robert Ludlum's novels of evil
worldwide conspiracies to Tom Clancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``A zillion techno-thriller novels replaced the Cold War, and
then almost every Third World area became a trouble zone,''
Applebaum said. ``Male readers are more than a bit restless for
something new.'' For this summer, at least, he hopes that they'll
go for something old, like World War II.
</P>
<P>
   That's not surprising since even Clancy seems to be spinning off
these days with nonfiction books similar to his novels. He is
edited by Neil Nyren, publisher and editor in chief of G.P.
PutnamPearson, who said the male adventure novel genre was getting
harder to make appealing to readers because the Cold War was over,
and ``for major spy novels you need a time of high paranoia.'' As
for the techno-thriller, Clancy has about exhausted its
possibilities, Nyren said.
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, someone will truly combine science fiction with
techno-thrillers into perhaps a universe-wide armed conflict genre.
``Star Wars'' has done it for children.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever one thinks of Clancy's prose style, he has been
generally ahead of the curve when it comes to devices to captivate
men.
</P>
<P>
   The male adventure genre will never disappear ``because
theoretically anything can happen at any time,'' Nyren said.
``Pretty soon, we'll see some more Russian bad guys again. Russia
is dangerously unstable. Which Russian has what nuclear weapons
stashed away? Who has what to sell?''
</P>
<P>
   August 2000 will be Clancy time again. Readers can expect Clancy
to have the answers then. I promise you.  &QL;

   ``True at First Light''
</P>
<P>
   By Ernest Hemingway (edited by Patrick Hemingway)
</P>
<P>
   Fictional memoir
</P>
<P>
   Scribner, $26
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   One hundred years after his birth, 38 years after he committed
suicide, Ernest Hemingway's literary legacy is the subject of
intense debate. That debate will be clouded by publication of
``True at First Light,'' a so-called fictional memoir gleaned from
manuscripts Hemingway scribbled, then put aside not too many years
before he chose death over life.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, of course, is that any truly great writer is judged
by the entirety of his printed output. With ``The Sun Also Rises,''
``To Have and Have Not,'' ``The Old Man and the Sea,'' ``A Farewell
to Arms'' and ``For Whom the Bell Tolls'' on his resume, Hemingway
deserves consideration as America's greatest modern-day writer. But
that shining list has already been tarnished with posthumous
publications like ``Islands in the Stream,'' stuff we naturally
assume Papa never would have wanted the world to read.
</P>
<P>
   ``True at First Light'' is, by objective comparison to
Hemingway's best, simply abysmal. It's a first-person narration of
Hemingway and Mary Welsh, his fourth wife, on safari in Africa. The
puzzle is meant to be deciphering how much is real and how much is
fiction. Hemingway's son Patrick, who edited the incomplete drafts
left behind by his father, explains in a convoluted introduction,
``Hemingway's untitled manuscript is about 200,000 words long and
is certainly not a journal. What you will read here is a fiction
half that length ... ambiguous counterpoint between fiction and
truth lies at the heart of this memoir.''
</P>
<P>
   Son Patrick assumes that most readers will be familiar with his
father's history. Accordingly, he dumps us into Kenya during
1953-54, as Miss Mary hunts a rogue lion and her husband divides
his time between her and a native tribeswoman Miss Mary dubs her
husband's ``fiancee.'' Why Miss Mary is so eager to blow a lion
away is explained only in notes following the main book, when we
learn that a previous Hemingway wife had killed a lion, and so Wife
No. 4 feels compelled to shoot one herself.
</P>
<P>
   The plot, if one can be described at all, meanders. There are
marauding Mau Mau about, but they are captured somewhere else, even
though Hemingway and his hearty band of native helpers are prepared
to fight them. There are mentions of books to be written,
appointments to be kept and futures to be determined, but mostly,
Hemingway and his wife hang around camp drinking gin, shooting
hoofed and feathered creatures, and talking about how much they
love each other. Even when Hemingway indulges in literary
chest-thumping, he produces tubercular coughs instead of
full-blooded roars. Readers learn how to load hunting rifles, and
where on animals' skulls one should aim the killing shot. But we
don't learn anything new about writing as an art or Hemingway as a
man.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the prose here sometimes becomes so hackneyed, so forced
instead of flowing, that we might imagine ``True at First Light''
is written by an impostor trying to mimic Hemingway:
</P>
<P>
   ``The rams broke into full speed as I raised the rifle. The
furthest one had his head turned toward me as I came out. ... There
was the report of the rifle, the dry whunk, and as I shucked in the
second shell I could see his four legs stiff in the air and his
white belly and then the legs lowered slowly. I walked out to him,
hoping I had not shot him in the behind and raked him or given him
the high spinal by mistake or hit him in the head and I heard the
car coming.''
</P>
<P>
   The only excuse for ``True at First Light'' is that, perhaps,
bad Hemingway is better than no Hemingway at all. Papa has been
dead almost four decades; his last great work, ``The Old Man and
the Sea,'' was published in 1952, the same year Dwight Eisenhower
was elected to his first term as president. Probably ``True at
First Light'' is our last chance to read ``new'' Hemingway, albeit
in a form that's so diluted.
</P>
<P>
   But that just doesn't wash. Ernest Hemingway swallowed a shotgun
because he couldn't stand being at anything other than the height
of his considerable powers. Subpar material such as ``True at First
Light'' wouldn't have lifted his spirits then, and it won't lift
ours now.

</P>
<P>

Victory Gardens.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   1945: In an effort to give bananas a designer label, the United
Fruit Company creates Chiquita Banana, a banana-cum-Carmen
Miranda-type Latin dancer. Chiquita, swinging her hips samba-style,
sings:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Chiquita Banana and I've come to say,
</P>
<P>
   ``Bananas have to ripen in a certain way;
</P>
<P>
   ``When they are flecked with brown and have a golden hue
</P>
<P>
   ``Bananas taste the best and are the best for you.''

   1947: Reddi-Wip is the first major U.S. aerosol food product.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Johnny marched off to war in the 1940s, and when he came home,
it was to a country that would never be the same.
</P>
<P>
   While he was gone, Jane had marched off to the local factory.
And she would never look at the kitchen, or her role in it, in the
same way.
</P>
<P>
   Although America was not yet in the war as the decade opened,
many of our resources were already being directed to efforts for
our eventual Allies. The hard times of the Depression faded as many
found jobs in war-oriented plants. And the troubles abroad made for
changes on the home front. Imports _ things such as spices _ became
scarce and expensive.
</P>
<P>
   From poster and billboards to magazines, Americans were urged to
conserve. In 1943, a Better Homes and Gardens article read ``Don't
squander drippings _ pour every dinky dab into a covered dish,
store in refrigerator. Use for seasoning and shortening in muffins,
spice cookies, gingerbread, corn bread and meat-pie toppers. Can't
use it all? Strain it _ pass it along for ammunition.''
</P>
<P>
   But American ingenuity is always at hand. Forever in love with
technology, food processors thought the world was ready for all
dehydrated food. Manufacturers came up with dehydrated clam juice;
dried spinach, beets and potatoes; powdered eggs; and even
dehydrated roasts and steaks. Cooks were willing to do their part
doing the war years, but afterward, they wanted the real deal. The
few foods that survived the craze were dried soups, puddings and
instant mashed potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   After America entered the war, households became accustomed to
planning meals around ration points. Each person was granted 12
ration points a week, and rationed grocery items were assigned
points. A pound of porterhouse steak in 1943 counted as 12 points,
but a pound of ground beef was only seven points, leading to the
popularity of meatloaf and stuffed peppers.
</P>
<P>
   Chicken become more popular, because it wasn't rationed, but it
was expensive. Margarine and ``salad oil'' made from American corn
were far more accessible than butter and imported olive oil and
became more important in the daily diet. Although sugar was
rationed, home canners could get extra to ``put up'' the fruits of
their Victory Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   (Americans had nothing on the suffering of Europeans, however.
Americans were allowed an average of 6 ounces of meat a day during
the war; the English ration was 16 ounces a week. When the young
Ted Koppel immigrated from England with his parents soon after the
war, he was stunned by the advertisements for sweets and consumer
goods in his new country. It would take years for a bombed-out
Europe to return to normal.)
</P>
<P>
   When the war ended in 1945, America was ready for revelry.
Millions of homes were built for returning GIs and their new
brides. Many households bought their first stoves, refrigerators,
washing machines and power lawn mowers.
</P>
<P>
   Food had become more standardized because of the military
experience. Troops from California to New York had been served the
same fare in mess halls, and that middle-of-the-road food became
the norm. And, Americans had access to travel as never before,
leading to the cookie-cutter fare of the Howard Johnsons and the
White Castles of the highways.
</P>
<P>
   Women looked at food differently, too. Having had a taste of the
working world (and the freedom of not being tied to the kitchen),
women jumped for convenience food. Canned fruits and vegetables
were back, and supermarkets were springing up in the nascent
suburbs, taking much of the chore out of cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone was ready for a rest.
</P>
<P>
   1940: One out of every five working women is a servant. Half are
black or Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   1940: A&AMP;P supermarkets sell the first pre-cut,
cellophane-wrapped meat. People no longer have to eat as much
preserved meat, such as corned beef, hams and sausages.
</P>
<P>
   1940: The first Dairy Queen opens in Joliet, Ill. By 1950, there
will be 1,156 Dairy Queen restaurants across the country.
</P>
<P>
   1941: President Roosevelt convenes the National Nutritional
Conference for Defense to examine the causes of the physical
defects found in so many young men called up for the draft. Mayo
Clinic nutrition expert Russell M. Wilder heads a group of experts
in a study of the eating habits of 2,000 representative U.S.
families.
</P>
<P>
   1941: South Carolina is the first state to require enrichment of
white bread with vitamins and iron.
</P>
<P>
   1941: In January, Gourmet's first issue is published. The cover
is a painting of a roasted boar's head.

A `WILD, WILD WEST' FOR EARLY TV WRITERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Four months ago, Gilbert Ralston, a top television
writer in the 1950s and '60s, lay dying of congestive heart failure
at the Sandpiper Court Yard, a home for the elderly near
Charleston, S.C. ``I've had a good life, a full life, an
interesting life,'' his son, Michael Ralston, recalled him saying.
``I don't have any issues except one. `Wild, Wild West.'''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ralston, a retired Navy officer who was a submarine
commander, reflected that his father, who died at 87, ``had written
many scripts _ about 20 `Ben Caseys,' `Gunsmoke,' `Naked City,' a
couple of `Star Treks.' But he created `Wild, Wild West.' He knew
the movie was being made. And he was stunned and mystified and
really very upset that they said he hadn't created the series.''
</P>
<P>
   The legal battle began in July 1997. Shortly after Ralston sent
a letter to CBS, the producer of ``Wild, Wild West,'' saying he had
created all the elements of the series, the network sued the aging
writer, arguing that he intended to defraud the network when he
wrote the original series in 1964. Ralston's family and lawyer said
the CBS move was an intimidation tactic to keep him from pressing
his case. CBS declined to comment. In October 1997, Ralston filed a
counterclaim in federal court seeking redress for his rights in
connection with the series.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the Ralston case puts a focus on a common
Hollywood practice of the 1950s and '60s. At the time, television
writers who helped create popular series allowed producers or
studios to take credit for a show and signed documents that, they
said, had the effect of cheating them of millions of dollars in
royalties decades later. The royalties came from the movies, videos
and merchandising from the television shows that the original
writers had a significant role in inventing.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring what is at stake is the popularity of the new film
``Wild, Wild West,'' which withstood poor reviews last week to take
in more than $35 million and emerge No. 1 at the box office this
week.
</P>
<P>
   A Warner Brothers lawyer who spoke on condition of anonymity
said that Ralston's family had ``no legitimate claim'' to legal
action and that the late writer or his family had not made an
effort until recently to seek potentially lucrative royalties. ``We
think it's a bogus, manufactured, after-the-fact claim,'' the
lawyer said. CBS declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   But testifying for Ralston, Roy Huggins, one of television's
most respected and successful writers of the 1950s and '60s, who
created or helped create such shows as ``Maverick,'' ``The
Fugitive,'' ``77 Sunset Strip,'' ``The Rockford Files'' and
``Baretta,'' said that it was almost commonplace then for companies
to engage in machinations that duped writers. Television writers,
he said, ``were no match for the major television networks, studios
and producers, whose contracts in most instances were structured to
obliterate'' the writers' prospects for earning profits and
royalties.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Franklin, who was executive director of the Writers
Guild of America West from 1958 to 1978 and has testified on behalf
of writers for such television series as ``Hawaii 5-0'' and ``Have
Gun, Will Travel,'' said in court papers on behalf of Ralston that
many television companies used deceptive practices to defeat ``a
pilot writer's entitlement'' to his or her rights. (The Writers
Guild has not supported the Ralstons, and a spokeswoman declined to
discuss the reasons.)
</P>
<P>
   Franklin and others said that in the 1960s and even '70s, the
Writers Guild and talent agents and lawyers failed to grasp the
nuances of the contracts signed by writers and the implications
years later.
</P>
<P>
   Ralston's family also said that Warner Brothers and CBS had
filed a countersuit against the writer in his last years simply in
an effort to intimidate him to drop the suit. ``He was 86, in a
wheelchair, and they sued him in federal court for $10 million
because he asserted his rights,'' his angry son said. ``I was
appalled at the tactics used to intimidate him. Periodically my
father asked: `Can they get my Social Security? Can they get my
Writers Guild pension?'''
</P>
<P>
   A Warner Brothers lawyer said the accusation of intimidation was
untrue. ``We knew he had made the claim, and it seemed the most
expedient way to get it resolved,'' the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   No dollar figure has been attached to the Ralston family's suit,
filed in the U.S. District Court for the central district of
California, but it could amount to millions of dollars. The
family's lawyer in the case, Marc Toberoff, said that the Ralstons
were seeking ``all available remedies, which may include profits
from the film in all media, and/or enjoining further distribution
of the film.'' The case is set for trial in mid-October in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The issues involved in the suit offer a glimpse into a murky
arena in which some authors gave up their rights, sometimes
wittingly, sometimes not, to studios and production companies.
Moreover, some writers failed to foresee that what they helped
create would prove a valuable property decades later.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ralston, who retired from the Navy in 1993 after 33
years, said his father was a CBS executive in New York in the
mid-'50s and moved to Los Angeles in the early '60s to pursue a
writing career. The elder Ralston moved to Charleston, S.C., in
1989 after his wife died.
</P>
<P>
   According to Toberoff and court papers, the elder Ralston
received a phone call in January 1995 from Dan Furie, a business
affairs executive at Warner Brothers, asking him if he had
``separation of rights'' on the television series. This is a term
meaning a writer has created an original pilot and is entitled to
royalties on every episode as well as theatrical and other rights.
</P>
<P>
   Ralston, then 85, without consulting a lawyer, said he didn't
know and would look into it. On Jan. 30 he wrote to Furie saying:
``For the record, I developed the pilot, characters therein, and
presented it to CBS and sat through the filmmaking. I developed the
locale, characters, characterizations, format, theme, pilot and
suggestions for future stories.'' He added that ``nothing was
supplied'' by CBS or Garrison Productions, which produced the
series.
</P>
<P>
   Ralston heard nothing further from Warner Brothers, his lawyer
said. Two months later he reached the widow of his former agent in
Los Angeles and related the story. The widow, Doris Halsey,
suggested that he call Toberoff, a lawyer who has specialized in
these cases.
</P>
<P>
   Toberoff said: ``He sent me his agreement. I interviewed him and
looked at the contract. And I quickly realized that this case is
exactly like numerous cases I've already seen from the '60s, in
which writers had been deprived of their intellectual property
rights.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   According to sworn statements presented by the elderly witnesses
in the case, it was commonplace in Hollywood in the 1960s for a
writer to create a series but then have an executive step in and
insist that the show was the network's or studio's idea. The
writers, many of them eager to work, acquiesced. In that way,
networks and studios held on to the rights of projects.
</P>
<P>
   Huggins, for example, said that when he came up with the story
for ``Colt .45,'' he was soon told by a Warner Brothers executive,
Hugh Benson, that Jack L. Warner, the studio chief, had actually
come up with the idea. ``I looked at Benson and said: `Really? I
think it's very strange that J.L. himself would come up with an
idea a year ago and nobody did anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Huggins recalled similar episodes with two other shows he
created, ``Maverick'' and ``77 Sunset Strip.'' On ``77 Sunset
Strip,'' for example, he said Warner Brothers, seeking to avoid
paying royalties, asked him to stretch the pilot to 90 minutes.
``Warner Brothers took that 90-minute show and previewed it in a
little town on an island in the Caribbean,'' Huggins said. ``God
knows where. I used to know. I don't anymore.'' He said Warner
Brothers then sold the movie as a pilot without making television
royalty payments to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean how much closer to real devilish machinations can you
get than to ask a guy to stretch a show to 90 minutes so you can
preview it in the Caribbean in a theater that probably only had
five people in it and then sell it as a movie?'' Huggins said.
``It's so devious I can't believe they got away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Huggins was given a credit in 1994 by Warner Brothers
as the creator of ``Maverick,'' the Mel Gibson-Jodie Foster film,
he was not paid for it. ``They didn't pay me a nickel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of ``Wild, Wild West,'' Ralston said in a deposition
on May 18, 1998, a producer, Michael Garrison, phoned him in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did he tell you in that conversation?'' Ralston was
asked.
</P>
<P>
   He replied: ``Said he had an idea for a series, good commercial
idea, and wanted to know if I could glue the idea of a western hero
and a James Bond type together in the same show.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralston said he then created the Civil War characters, the
format, the story outline and nine drafts of the script that was
the basis for the television series. Ralston said it was his idea,
for example, to have a secret agent named Jim West who would
perform secret missions for a bumbling Ulysses S. Grant.
</P>
<P>
   Similar characters form the basis for the current film. (Six
writers are given credit for the film, but Ralston's name does not
appear.) Garrison died in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   CBS, in turn, contended that Ralston ``did not create the major
elements of `The Wild, Wild West' property and simply wrote a
teleplay from an `established episodic series' or `established
serial' based on material CBS or Garrison provided to him.'' CBS
also said that several former network executives were involved in
the creation of the characters, although witnesses for Ralston
vigorously denied this.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent depositions, some former top CBS executives
generally supported the Ralston family. John Cheney Rock, a network
business affairs executive in the 1960s, said: ``Gil Ralston wrote
the basic thing. At CBS we didn't have anybody employed to write in
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if people at CBS at the time believed Ralston had created
``The Wild, Wild West,'' Rock replied, ``Definitely.''
</P>
<P>
   Another former top CBS executive, Michael Dann, who was the
network's vice president for programming in 1964, said he did not
believe that former network executives wrote the show. ``We all as
a group felt that Gil Ralston was the person who supplied the
creative framework and implementation of a concept of `The Wild
West,''' West said.

ANALYSIS: GRASS-ROOTS ANGER WITH MILOSEVIC SWEEPS ACROSS SERBIA 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By BLAINE HARDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ More quickly than the political opponents
of Slobodan Milosevic had dared hope, grass-roots dissatisfaction
with the Yugoslav president is surfacing across much of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Hostility toward Milosevic, bubbling up this week on the streets
of the most unlikely of towns, has raised expectations among
opposition politicians that Milosevic's survival in power might now
be measured not in years, but in months.
</P>
<P>
   What has particularly raised eyebrows among political analysts,
who are beginning to doubt if opposition parties can keep up with
grass-roots anger, is the surprise eruption of large and violent
protests in the large southern Serbian city of Leskovac, a
long-time stronghold of the Milosevic regime.
</P>
<P>
   There, without the help of any political party, but with the
active involvement of army reservists who fought in the lost war in
Kosovo, more than 20,000 people marched on Monday night calling for
Milosevic to resign. On Tuesday, about 2,000 people charged the
local police station, demanding the release of the local TV
technician who organized Monday's rally.
</P>
<P>
   Police responded with tear gas and by beating demonstrators with
nightsticks. Demonstrators retreated and later attacked the home of
a local political boss who belongs to the Yugoslav Left, a
hard-line Communist party headed by Milosevic's wife. They smashed
windows in the house and destroyed its front gate, a police
official there said by phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Milosevic is in trouble in Leskovac, then he is really in
trouble,'' said Aleksa Djilas, a historian and political analyst in
Belgrade who is not affiliated with the opposition groups trying to
force the Yugoslav leader from office. ``It is like a Kennedy being
in trouble in Boston. This is the beginning of the end. I don't
know when the end will happen, but it will be months, not years.''
</P>
<P>
   The muscular involvement of Yugoslav army reservists in
demonstrations in Leskovac is a wild-card element which, if
repeated in towns and cities across Serbia, could tip the scales
against Milosevic much more quickly than opposition leaders had
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of the Kosovo war in early June, hundreds of
reservists have intermittently blocked roads and bridges in central
and southern Serbia, demanding pay for their service during the
11-week war in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The survival skills of Milosevic, who has been indicted on war
crimes charges, should not be underestimated. Although he has lost
four wars this decade while presiding over the implosion of the
economy, he remains a shrewd politician. He has weathered eruptions
of mass unhappiness in Serbia before, most recently in the winter
of 1996-97, when three months of daily demonstrations all but
paralyzed Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The two major tools in his survival kit are an enormous state
police apparatus, which is still believed to be loyal, and state
television, which is the primary source of information for most of
the country.
</P>
<P>
   There is a consensus among opposition leaders that Milosevic
cannot afford politically to use the police to arrest, injure or
kill large numbers of Serbs. As Zoran Djindjic, a key opposition
leader, said in a rally on Tuesday night in the southwest Serbian
town of Uzice, ``If there are a lot of us, they will not use
force.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they expect Milosevic to do what he has done in the
past, deploy his police and his large party apparatus to harass,
intimidate and try to buy off the opposition. For instance, to
disrupt an opposition rally planned for Thursday night in the
southern Serbian town of Prokuplje, Milosevic's Socialist Party has
called its own rally at the same place and time. He tried the same
tactic two years ago in Belgrade, without much success in igniting
street violence.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves television, which is doing what it has done so
effectively throughout Milosevic's 12 years in power. It ignores or
distorts all the news that is bad for Milosevic and his family,
while vilifying their rivals and critics as corrupt, anti-Serbian
traitors. There has been almost no TV coverage, for instance, of
this week's trouble in Leskovac or of three large opposition
rallies in Serbia in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As they have been for years, opposition leaders in Serbia are
divided about how best to plug into popular discontent, which is
rooted both in anger about the lost war in Kosovo and fear of the
collapsing economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian Renewal Movement, led by the charismatic Vuk
Draskovic, had insisted since the war in Kosovo ended that the time
was not right for street demonstrations. Draskovic, as recently as
Monday, told a news conference that he is a ``legalist'' who wants
to press for reform from within the system.
</P>
<P>
   The stunning news from Leskovac, which is controlled by
Milosevic's Socialists but where the Serbian Renewal Movement is
the main opposition group, appears to have forced the hand of
Draskovic. His party announced Wednesday that it will take charge
of a rally in Leskovac on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   A senior adviser in the party, Ognjen Privbicevic, offered this
explanation for Draskovic's sudden and seemingly opportunistic
change of strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vuk has such a good nose for these things,'' said Privbicevic.
``Things are changing so quickly here. Nothing is predictable. This
is the first rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Milan Bozic, the deputy mayor of Belgrade and a top leader in
the Serbian Renewal Movement, said that all political parties in
Serbia have underestimated both the depth of popular anti-Milosevic
feeling and its power to bring people to the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of sudden, it looks as though frustration over Milosevic
is much more deeply embedded into the national consciousness than
we expected,'' Bozic said.
</P>
<P>
   Djindjic, a key leader of the Alliance for Change, a coalition
of opposition groups, and a rival of Draskovic, delivered a
rousing, if vague, speech on Tuesday that envisioned simultaneous
daily rallies in towns across the country as well as a general
strike.
</P>
<P>
   Djindjic said he expects the Serbian Orthodox Church, which last
month demanded that Milosevic resign and which has since been
bitterly condemned on state television, will soon join the
opposition and ring church bells across the country to call Serbs
out on the nationwide general strike.
</P>
<P>
   The timing and the planning for that strike are not yet clear,
according to Milan Protic, also a leader of the Alliance for
Change. He said the opposition movement has not yet sat down with
church leaders to ask for their help.
</P>
<P>
   The Milosevic regime appears to fear the involvement of the
church in politics. Politika, its main newspaper, Wednesday
published an angry commentary that condemned church leaders for
making peace in Kosovo with ``terrorist'' Albanian leaders and
warned the church to avoid the ``murky waters'' of politics.

   KOSOVO-JOURNAL _ PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ The carnage in Kosovo
was the first story I have covered that was bigger than it looked
on television. In Hurricane Andrew, in 1992, the casualties were
limited and life continued in many parts of Miami. December's
bombing of Iraq provided good televised fireworks, but most Iraqis
were barely inconvenienced. But Kosovo was a story of blind ethnic
hatred -- the poison that germinates with simple bigotry and
transforms so easily into bloodshed. Its ravages are not confinable
to a television screen. The acts of evil were too numerous for a
journalist to report and too vast to escape. (Kaplow, Cox News

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Relief from the extreme heat that griped the Northeast earlier
this week will continue Thursday as the circulation around high
pressure over the Ohio Valley directs seasonably warm and dry air
into the region. Skies will be mainly sunny, though scattered
cumulus clouds will accompany a weak cool front crossing interior
New England. Spotty afternoon showers may briefly dampen the Green
and White mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered thunderstorms will surround a stationary front
stretching from northern Alabama to North Carolina. South of the
front, humid air will also fuel isolated thunderstorms near the
Gulf and Southeast coasts. A more concentrated area of
thunderstorms associated with a jet stream disturbance will bring
torrential rain to portions of Louisiana and eastern Texas where
some flooding may occur.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly humid air will surge north through the Plains,
setting the stage for heavy precipitation. Separated showers and
thunderstorms will likely congeal into a large complex over the
eastern Dakotas and upper Mississippi Valley on Thursday, bringing
the risk for heavy rain to the region. Localized flooding is
likely.
</P>
<P>
   Moist air in the lowest 10,000 feet of the atmosphere will spark
spotty thundershowers in the Southwest and southern Rockies.
Thundershowers will be most numerous during the afternoon as
heating of the ground and overlying air by the sun encourages
ascending currents of humid air. Abundant sun will cover northern
California and the Northwest though gentle onshore breezes will
cause clouds to cling to the Washington coast. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Desert Flooding &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At least two cars were swept away in Tucson, Ariz., on Tuesday
as flood waters as deep as 3 feet surged through city streets.
Flash flooding is a hallmark of the summer monsoon in the Southwest
as humid air streams north from the tropics, providing fuel for
slow-moving thunderstorms that produce heavy rain. But the desert
floor does not readily absorb large amounts of water due to its
sandy soil and a lack of plants. Run-off from rain can be very
rapid. In summer, an arroyo, which is a dry creek bed, can change
from a arid gulch to a raging torrent in a matter of seconds. &QL;

   MUSIC-KIDDIE-POP (Undated) _ This season belongs to the
kiddie-pop brigades. Applause is passe; the reaction most eagerly
sought by pop culture right now, from music to television to
movies, is a high-pitched squeal from a mob of young girls. When
it's directed at males, that squeal signifies romantic fantasy
while it tests out some newly active hormonal responses. Directed
at females, it's a squeal of sisterly solidarity and fashion
approval. And for the last few years, its volume has been steadily
rising until it threatens to drown out anything with more mature
audiences in mind. Kiddie-pop has always been available to those
who wanted it, but in the late 1990s, it's turning into the only
game in town. By Jon Pareles.

   THEATER-HOLOCAUST (New York) _ Whenever central casting is
called on to fill the role of a Holocaust survivor, rarely does it
cast against type. Indeed, whether onstage or in films, the
Holocaust survivor is often reduced to a one-dimensional cliche, a
cartoon of a stock character that seems to dominate the perceptions
of those in the dramatic arts. Apparently, filmmakers and
playwrights like their Holocaust survivors tortured, tyrannical and
delusional _often all at the same time. But a current play suggests
an alternative depiction. By Thane Rosenbaum.

<P>
   FILM-FRANCE (Undated) _ In France, comedy is what we call `une
maladie du regard,' an outlook dooming you to see what is
ridiculous in life,'' said the writer-director Francis Veber. In
Veber's case, comedy has proved to be a malady worth having. In
France, he is like a one-man comedy industry: among the classic
hits that he has created are ``La Cage Aux Folles,'' ``Les
Comperes,'' and ``The Tall Blond Man With One Black Shoe.'' Veber's
most recent movie, ``The Dinner Game,'' (``Le Diner de Cons'')
which opens July 9, has the clash of wills and split-second timing
that are his trademarks. By Laura Winters.

   DANCE-NY-BALLET (New York) _ Since it ain't over till it's over,
it may be premature to declare the New York City Ballet's 50th
anniversary year at an end. The celebration continues through July
24 at the company's summer home, the Saratoga Performing Arts
Center in upstate New York. Nonetheless, the sum went beyond the
parts in the recent City Ballet season at the New York State
Theater. By Anna Kisselgoff.

   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-OPERA (Undated) _ Since the dawn of recording, combining
two popular opera singers in an album has often proved a canny
business venture. From Caruso and Farrar to Callas and di Stefano,
Pavarotti and Sutherland, and Alagna and Gheorghiu, record buyers
have responded enthusiastically to the sparks that can ignite when
two musical artists with distinctive voices, personalities and
interpretive styles come together. By Lawrence A. Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-FISCHER-DIESKAU (Undated) _ All superlatives for the
artistic impact and record-setting extensiveness of Dietrich
Fischer-Dieskau's singing career have long since been exhausted. It
is to the credit of Bruno Monsaingeon, the director of a
documentary film on the singer just released by Atlantic Records,
that he makes the stale fresh. By Will Crutchfield.

ever more clearly into view as one of the time's great monuments.
By Paul Griffiths.

   SCULPTURE-ITALY (Pistoia) _ Sculpture gardens bloom in many a
cultured field today. Museums consider them prestigious adjuncts,
cities invest in them as tourist attractions, philanthropists see
them as proof that art is long, life short and bronze a kind of
immortality. In Italy today, the past takes precedence, and
Italians show almost no interest in gardens planted with the work
of living artists. One rare exception is the home of Giuliano Gori,
an industrialist who has created a lovely and uncommon blend of
19th-century Romantic garden and art of the last 20 years at the
Fattoria di Celle, his villa and farm near Pistoia, in Tuscany. By

years. By Anita Gates.

   ARTIFACTS-HUGUENOTS (New York) _ When looking at good English
silver from the 17th and 18th centuries, one should remember that
it was meant to be seen by the flicker of candlelight. In such
light, silver shimmers with the fluidity of water. Seen under
lighting that suggests candlelight, the 112 pieces of silver in
``The Huguenot Legacy: English Silver 1680-1760,'' an exhibition at
the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum in Manhattan, is like a
glittering ocean with more than a few lobsters, dolphins and water
monsters surfacing in the decor of the objects. By Paula Dietz.

MAKING HORROR HORRIBLE AGAIN: INTO A FOREST FULL OF WITCHERY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JUSTINE ELIAS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the start of ``The Blair Witch Project,'' in place of opening
credits, a title card announces that the film was assembled from
video and 16-millimeter footage found buried in the foundation of
an isolated cabin near Burkittsville, Md. The three filmmakers, who
had traveled there to interview residents about the legendary witch
and dozens of unsolved child murders that occurred in the area over
the last 200 years, are said to be still missing.
</P>
<P>
   While an early scene shows the three filmmakers, all college
students, poking around a rural cemetery, laughing about a blood
sacrifice that will make their spooky documentary shoot run
smoothly, it is clear that ``The Blair Witch Project,'' which opens
July 14, is not a typical horror movie. There are no Grand Guignol
effects, no media-savvy serial killers, and no hip protagonists
chatting so knowingly about pop culture that they barely have time
to scream. The eerie, oblique story is as primal as the tale of
Hansel and Gretel, but with a contemporary cinema-verite twist.
</P>
<P>
   At the Cannes International Film Festival in May, ``The Blair
Witch Project won the Prix de Jeunesse (the Youth Prize awarded to
young filmmakers), the only American film to win anything. But the
talk about ``Blair Witch'' actually began six months ago, when it
made its debut as a midnight movie at the Sundance Film Festival.
Within days, Artisan Entertainment _ which is reported to have paid
just over $1 million for the worldwide distribution rights _
mounted an elaborate publicity campaign, including a Web site
(www.Blairwitch.com) of supplementary photographs and video clips,
intended to pique interest in ``Blair Witch'' without revealing its
secrets. One key ingredient is the film's signature image: a crude,
ominous stick-figure drawing of a man, whose significance isn't
clear until well into the movie. Amir Malin, the president of
Artisan, says he becomes edgy just talking about the icon. ``It's
true, the thing scares me,'' he said. ``It's a marketing person's
dream, but I don't want it in my office.''
</P>
<P>
   Malin isn't alone in seeming in thrall to the ``Blair Witch''
spell after an eight-minute trailer for the film was shown this
spring on the Independent Film Channel, the movie producers
received a frantic phone call from a private investigator from New
York. Though he had seen only the last three minutes of the clip,
he was shaken and had spent several days trying to run down more
information about the disappearances.
</P>
<P>
   In its theme, ``The Blair Witch Project'' bears some resemblance
to ``Picnic at Hanging Rock,'' the 1975 Peter Weir film about the
disappearance of three Australian schoolgirls. Unlike that polished
movie, though, ``Blair Witch'' has all the earmarks of hasty,
inexperienced and enthusiastic filmmaking: occasionally shaky
camera work, harsh lighting, and off-screen noise and laughter
during important shots. The three students _ Heather, the project's
charismatic, ruthless director; Josh, an easygoing camera operator,
and Mike, a sullen sound man _ are shown waking up at dawn, hungry,
with rough voices and puffy eyes, grousing about who is responsible
for getting them lost in the woods.
</P>
<P>
   As they venture deeper into the forest, their survival is
threatened from without, by an unearthly, unseen presence, and from
within, when, in their desperation and abject fear, they begin to
turn on each other.
</P>
<P>
   The inspiration for ``The Blair Witch Project'' came not from
horrific true stories but from the imaginations of two first-time
filmmakers, Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, who met as film
students at the University of Central Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were talking one night about the best horror films ever
made,'' said Myrick, who is 35. ``And we decided that there hadn't
really been one that scared us, really scared us, since we were
kids.'' The reason, Myrick says, is that too many recent horror
films have used satire and humor to re-invigorate a genre that had
become predictable and repetitive. Some of their favorite horror
films _ ``Nightmare on Elm Street,'' ``The Shining'' and ``The
Exorcist'' _ force audiences to identify the characters' sense of
being trapped in a bad dream. And, Myrick added, ``that feeling, of
not knowing what's real, stays with you after you leave the
theater.''
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers' own bad dreams, though, seem to have their
origins in the movies they watched as children: mid-1970s
pseudo-documentaries like ``Bigfoot _ Man or Beast,'' ``Chariots of
the Gods'' and ``Legend of Boggy Creek,'' about one of Bigfoot's
swamp-dwelling cousins.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired _ and more than a bit unsettled _ Myrick, at age 9,
started a U.F.O. investigations club while growing up in Florida.
Sanchez, reared in Washington, says an episode of the television
show ``In Search Of ... '' caused him, as a child, to believe
Bigfoot might peer into his bathroom window when he was taking a
shower _ an unlikely event, since his family lived on the second
floor of a suburban apartment complex, and Bigfoot, according to
most sightings, stands 7 or 8 feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   When the two met years later, they collaborated on several short
films, graduated and returned to their day jobs: Myrick worked
behind the scenes in television commercials, tended bar and drove a
truck, while Sanchez worked in Web-page design and as a film set
decorator.
</P>
<P>
   With no advance financing (their initial $25,000 budget was
raised with credit card advances) and little time to shoot, the two
came up with the idea of a cinema-verite thriller, one that could
be shot on the relatively inexpensive formats of color video and
black-and-white 16-millimeter film. It was practicality as much as
anything, says Myrick. ``With a strong premise, we didn't need
stars,'' he said. ``The movie wouldn't work with stars. All the
weaknesses of low-budget filmmaking are this movie's strengths.''
</P>
<P>
   At first they thought of sending their characters into a
supposedly haunted house. ``But as we talked about it, we started
talking about the fears we had as kids,'' Sanchez said. ``We came
up with a story we wished we'd heard around a campfire _ a
200-year-old legend about an outcast, a cursed town and a series of
child murders and unexplained disappearances.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because they have drawn upon urban legends and
well-known ghost stories, Myrick said, people have been saying, ``
`Blair Witch,' oh, yes, I've heard that story before.''' He
continued: ``It's romantic, I think, to have some spooky house down
the street, or an area in the woods where people are afraid to go,
because it's an Indian burial ground. We took that feeling and
built a world around it.''
</P>
<P>
   The imperiled filmmakers are portrayed by Heather Donahue,
Joshua Leonard and Michael Williams, who spent several
uncomfortable days and nights camping in a Maryland state park.
Guided by a hand-held global positioning system and brief notes
left for them by the actual filmmakers, the actors followed a
directive to film everything they did and said. Though they had
been briefed on the basic premise of ``Blair Witch,'' and warned
about the discomfort they would suffer during production, the
actors did not know how their stories would unfold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan and I had it easy,'' Sanchez said, laughing. ``We hung out
at Chi-Chi's while they were out there in the rain, in the woods.''
Each night, though, he and Myrick made surprise visits to the
campsites, making threatening noises and shadows and scaring the
actors out of their wits. To navigate in the dark and to elude the
actors' ever-present cameras, Myrick and Sanchez relied on the
expertise of one of their producers, Gregg Hale, a former sergeant
in the Army's Special Forces, who had endured lengthy training
sessions on how to evade capture in enemy territory. The cast and
crew's exploits, which Myrick and Sanchez call method filmmaking,
produced 20 hours of usable footage and some surprisingly
naturalistic performances.

   Search engines just cannot keep up with the Web. That is the
finding of two scientists for the NEC Research Institute who have
spent the past six months determining how many Web pages exist _
and how many are actually picked up by the likes of Alta Vista and
Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   Their results, which are published Thursday in the journal
Nature, paint a meager picture: Of 11 search engines studied, not
one indexes more than 16 percent of the Web. Most cover less.
</P>
<P>
   ``Search engines are increasingly falling behind in their
efforts to index the Web,'' wrote Steve Lawrence and C. Lee Giles,
the scientists who conducted the study. In a similar study two
years ago, the researchers found that the largest coverage of a
single search engine, Hotbot (www.hotbot.com), was 34 percent of
the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the current study, which are available at
www.wwwmetrics.com, show that Northern Light
(www.northernlight.com) has the largest coverage, with an index
that contains 16 percent of Web pages that can be indexed. Lycos
(www.lycos.com) and Euroseek (www.euroseek.net) appeared to have
the least, covering only 2.5 percent and 2.2 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The study revealed more about the state of the Web, particularly
about how much has become commercial: 83 percent of sites contain
commercial content while only about 6 percent contain scientific
and educational content. Only 1.5 percent have pornography, a
figure that might surprise many Web surfers.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also found that people who are searching for
information that is less well known are probably missing out
because some search engines use the popularity of Web pages to
determine whether they should be indexed.
</P>
<P>
   To begin their research, Lawrence and Giles estimated the size
of the Web. Their tally: 2.8 million sites and 800 million pages.
They then used an automated program to plug 1,050 queries into each
search engine and tabulate the results. The queries, which included
phrases like ``smart matter'' and ``rocchio algorithm,'' were
obtained from a list of queries used by their fellow scientists at
the NEC Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not representative of general Web users,'' Lawrence
acknowledged in an interview. ``But the important issue here is
that the search engines seem to be biased toward more well-known
information.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, they are probably finding information that is out
of date. Even the newest pages retrieved from the search engines
were as many as eight months old, according to the researchers'
data.
</P>
<P>
   For those seeking a way out, Lawrence suggested conducting a
metasearch _ one that combines the results of several search
engines. He hesitated to suggest specific names, but a search on
the word metasearch in Hotbot turned up these: www.metacrawler.com,
www.metasearch.com and www.dogpile.com. Of course, who knows what
else might be out there?

   Hewlett-Packard to Shut Down Production of a Cult Favorite
</P>
<P>
   Before there was Palm Pilot mania, there was Palmtop mania. The
Palmtop 200LX was the latest in the LX line made by
Hewlett-Packard. A tiny notebook (weighing less than a pound), it
was the last popular PC to be made to run on MS-DOS.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Hewlett-Packard announced that it would no longer
manufacture the Palmtop line, which had become a victim of time and
the popularity of Windows CE. But, like fans of Elvis, Palmtop
aficionados can't really believe the king is gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had to work to sell one in two years. It has one of
the most loyal followings I've ever seen,'' said Kevin Havre,
Hewlett-Packard's technical marketing manager for North America.
Unlike current subnotebooks, the Palmtop was designed to work as a
sole computer, not as an appendage to a desktop. ``It's the
smallest PC _ quote, unquote,'' he said. ``The Palmtop was a PC. A
full PC. Period.''
</P>
<P>
   Hal Goldstein, publisher of the Hewlett-Packard Palmtop Paper
(www.thaddeus.com), says the Palmtop's size and versatility made it
so popular, particularly among doctors, engineers and brokers.
``The applications were brilliant,'' Goldstein said. ``You could
customize the database so easily.'' Its fans created what he
described as a ``Linux-like library of hundreds of applications''
(www.palmtop.net), including a drug formula program for doctors and
another that allowed users to turn the horizontal screen on its
side to read a book page.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Francis, an assembly line operator in Kentucky, described
his Palmtop as ``a computer that can do everything a desktop can
do, which fits neatly in your pocket and runs for weeks on two AA
batteries.'' But he was less magnanimous about Hewlett-Packard's
decision to discontinue the line. ``Most users of the DOS LX
Palmtops abhor the Windows CE interface. For us, there is no
comparing our sleek and fast interface with the eye candy interface
Win CE provides.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Johns, a deputy sheriff with the Jefferson County Sheriff's
Department in Birmingham, Ala., probably created the most novel
uses for his Palmtop. ``It meant I could turn off my desktop and
never turn it on again.'' In addition to running criminal checks on
his 200LX, he rigged it up to an antenna made of hangers, then to
his police antenna, to talk to the Mir space station. ``How many
policemen do you know who exchange messages with cosmonauts while
driving around in their squad car?'' Johns asked.

   Videogame Worker Dismissed for Selling Fantasy Real Estate
</P>
<P>
   A popular expression about real estate is ``they're not making
more of it.'' But when it comes to virtual real estate, a videogame
employee not only made more of it _ he lost his job for selling
some over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a game software maker, Origin Systems, dismissed an
employee for earning almost $7,000 by selling fantasy real estate
on Ebay, an online auction site.
</P>
<P>
   The employee, Kevin Roseler, 24, worked for Origin and monitored
Ultima Online, a fantasy role-playing game world with 150,000
members. Using his computer privileges, Roseler generated castles
and other valuable game property, which he is said to have sold
over a month through Ebay auctions. Another Ebay user noticed the
sequence of unusual auctions and notified the company, which then
dismissed Roseler.
</P>
<P>
   The company did not require Roseler to return the money. While
his actions were not illegal, they were an abuse of privileges and
a breach of trust, said the company, which is a subsidiary of
Electronic Arts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they brought me into the office, they were talking about
corporate embezzlement, but I went to a lawyer who told me that I
didn't steal anything tangible,'' Roseler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing I really stole. I broke their trust,'' he
said, adding that he considered that the ``worst part.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebay has become a vibrant market for people looking to move up
the fantasy-game ladder. Hundreds of items like castles, gold and
treasure maps are sold by more experienced players who have
accumulated properties throughout their role-playing careers.
Roseler sold property that could be converted to virtual gold. The
approximate exchange rate on auction sites is one real dollar for
500 virtual gold pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Roseler said the company had warned its employees about selling
game property on the auction sites. ``I knew that I if I was
caught, I would be fired,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had taken the risk to raise money for friends who
were having financial problems. ``In 20-20 hindsight, I wish I had
used a different way to help them,'' said Roseler, who has found a
new job.

   Summer Book Club
</P>
<P>
   Public libraries learned long ago that if you want to get
children to read books over the summer, you probably need to dangle
a prize before their eyes. Now a new Web site called Book Adventure
has brought the same concept to the Internet. The site,
www.bookadventure.com, offers prizes to children who earn points
for successfully answering online questions about the books they
have read. Points can be redeemed for prizes, like gift
certificates to Barnesandnoble.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want it to be self-motivating,'' said Brent McCallister,
program director for the site, which is sponsored by the Sylvan
Educational Foundation, a nonprofit organization based in
Baltimore. ``This is a great way to harness the power of the Web in
a safe, educational way.''

<P>
   Baseball fans who cannot tear themselves away from their
computers can still catch each pitch and play of next Tuesday's
all-star game as it happens by logging on to
www.majorleaguebaseball.com and clicking on the Sportsline USA's
Baseball Live feature. Baseball Live uses animated illustrations to
add depth to coverage along with chat forums and troves of
statistics. For fans abroad, it may be the best alternative to
watching on TV.

   That is the backdrop for Escalation
(brainsoft.ne.mediaone.net/escalation), a simulation Web site set
up by 17-year-old Nathaniel Duca of Wenham, Mass., one of eight
finalists for the first annual Ars Digita Prize. The contest
rewards teen-agers who build noncommercial Web sites. The grand
prize of $10,000 was won by Daniel Hunter, 18, of Richmond, Ind.,
for the Earlham Web Calendar (www.earlham.edu/calendar), a site
that posts events at Earlham College.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ More quickly than the political opponents
of Slobodan Milosevic had dared hope, grass-roots dissatisfaction
with the Yugoslav president is surfacing across much of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Hostility toward Milosevic, bubbling up this week on the streets
of the most unlikely of towns, has raised expectations among
opposition politicians that Milosevic's survival in power might now
be measured not in years, but in months.
</P>
<P>
   What has particularly raised eyebrows among political analysts,
who are beginning to doubt if opposition parties can keep up with
grass-roots anger, is the surprise eruption of large and violent
protests in the large southern Serbian city of Leskovac, a
long-time stronghold of the Milosevic regime.
</P>
<P>
   There, without the help of any political party, but with the
active involvement of army reservists who fought in the lost war in
Kosovo, more than 20,000 people marched on Monday night calling for
Milosevic to resign. On Tuesday, about 2,000 people charged the
local police station, demanding the release of the local TV
technician who organized Monday's rally.
</P>
<P>
   Police responded with tear gas and by beating demonstrators with
nightsticks. Demonstrators retreated and later attacked the home of
a local political boss who belongs to the Yugoslav Left, a
hard-line Communist party headed by Milosevic's wife. They smashed
windows in the house and destroyed its front gate, a police
official there said by phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Milosevic is in trouble in Leskovac, then he is really in
trouble,'' said Aleksa Djilas, a historian and political analyst in
Belgrade who is not affiliated with the opposition groups trying to
force the Yugoslav leader from office. ``It is like a Kennedy being
in trouble in Boston. This is the beginning of the end. I don't
know when the end will happen, but it will be months, not years.''
</P>
<P>
   The muscular involvement of Yugoslav army reservists in
demonstrations in Leskovac is a wild-card element which, if
repeated in towns and cities across Serbia, could tip the scales
against Milosevic much more quickly than opposition leaders had
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of the Kosovo war in early June, hundreds of
reservists have intermittently blocked roads and bridges in central
and southern Serbia, demanding pay for their service during the
11-week war in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The survival skills of Milosevic, who has been indicted on war
crimes charges, should not be underestimated. Although he has lost
four wars this decade while presiding over the implosion of the
economy, he remains a shrewd politician. He has weathered eruptions
of mass unhappiness in Serbia before, most recently in the winter
of 1996-97, when three months of daily demonstrations all but
paralyzed Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The two major tools in his survival kit are an enormous state
police apparatus, which is still believed to be loyal, and state
television, which is the primary source of information for most of
the country.
</P>
<P>
   There is a consensus among opposition leaders that Milosevic
cannot afford politically to use the police to arrest, injure or
kill large numbers of Serbs. As Zoran Djindjic, a key opposition
leader, said in a rally on Tuesday night in the southwest Serbian
town of Uzice, ``If there are a lot of us, they will not use
force.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they expect Milosevic to do what he has done in the
past, deploy his police and his large party apparatus to harass,
intimidate and try to buy off the opposition. For instance, to
disrupt an opposition rally planned for Thursday night in the
southern Serbian town of Prokuplje, Milosevic's Socialist Party has
called its own rally at the same place and time. He tried the same
tactic two years ago in Belgrade, without much success in igniting
street violence.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves television, which is doing what it has done so
effectively throughout Milosevic's 12 years in power. It ignores or
distorts all the news that is bad for Milosevic and his family,
while vilifying their rivals and critics as corrupt, anti-Serbian
traitors. There has been almost no TV coverage, for instance, of
this week's trouble in Leskovac or of three large opposition
rallies in Serbia in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As they have been for years, opposition leaders in Serbia are
divided about how best to plug into popular discontent, which is
rooted both in anger about the lost war in Kosovo and fear of the
collapsing economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian Renewal Movement, led by the charismatic Vuk
Draskovic, had insisted since the war in Kosovo ended that the time
was not right for street demonstrations. Draskovic, as recently as
Monday, told a news conference that he is a ``legalist'' who wants
to press for reform from within the system.
</P>
<P>
   The stunning news from Leskovac, which is controlled by
Milosevic's Socialists but where the Serbian Renewal Movement is
the main opposition group, appears to have forced the hand of
Draskovic. His party announced Wednesday that it will take charge
of a rally in Leskovac on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   A senior adviser in the party, Ognjen Privbicevic, offered this
explanation for Draskovic's sudden and seemingly opportunistic
change of strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vuk has such a good nose for these things,'' said Privbicevic.
``Things are changing so quickly here. Nothing is predictable. This
is the first rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Milan Bozic, the deputy mayor of Belgrade and a top leader in
the Serbian Renewal Movement, said that all political parties in
Serbia have underestimated both the depth of popular anti-Milosevic
feeling and its power to bring people to the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of sudden, it looks as though frustration over Milosevic
is much more deeply embedded into the national consciousness than
we expected,'' Bozic said.
</P>
<P>
   Djindjic, a key leader of the Alliance for Change, a coalition
of opposition groups, and a rival of Draskovic, delivered a
rousing, if vague, speech on Tuesday that envisioned simultaneous
daily rallies in towns across the country as well as a general
strike.
</P>
<P>
   Djindjic said he expects the Serbian Orthodox Church, which last
month demanded that Milosevic resign and which has since been
bitterly condemned on state television, will soon join the
opposition and ring church bells across the country to call Serbs
out on the nationwide general strike.
</P>
<P>
   The timing and the planning for that strike are not yet clear,
according to Milan Protic, also a leader of the Alliance for
Change. He said the opposition movement has not yet sat down with
church leaders to ask for their help.
</P>
<P>
   The Milosevic regime appears to fear the involvement of the
church in politics. Politika, its main newspaper, Wednesday
published an angry commentary that condemned church leaders for
making peace in Kosovo with ``terrorist'' Albanian leaders and
warned the church to avoid the ``murky waters'' of politics.

   CIR-COMPUTER-COLUMN (Undated) _ The weekly computer column: The
personal computer, which gained popular acceptance in the 1980s for
its ability to perform a wide variety of business and scientific
tasks, is increasingly being recognized in the late 1990s as
primarily a communications device that enables anyone to send and
receive electronic mail, participate in discussion groups and
browse for information on the Internet's World Wide Web. And now,
the PC is following the model of the cellular phone, which is often
given away or sold at low cost to customers who sign up for service
contracts. By Peter H. Lewis.

 &HT;    Tech firms crash Business Week list
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Internet has scrambled the ranking of the world's
biggest corporations, bringing to the top of the list companies
that just a few years ago barely showed up, Business Week (July 12)
says in its annual Global 1,000 report.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ego, Japanese banks, a Swiss confectioner and a
Philadelphia utility were vastly more popular with investors than
Microsoft. With a market value (share price times shares
outstanding) of $3.3 billion, the software company ranked 539th on
the 1989 list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, after riding the personal-computer wave right into the
Internet boom, Microsoft has vaulted to No. 1,'' with a market cap
of $407.22 billion. Three other high-tech companies are in the top
10.
</P>
<P>
   After Microsoft, the world's 10 biggest companies ranked by
market value are General Electric, IBM, Exxon, Royal Dutch/Shell,
Wal-Mart Stores, AT&AMP;T, Intel, Cisco Systems and BP Amoco.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia companies in the top 100 are Coca-Cola, 11th; BellSouth,
36th; and Home Depot, 41st.
</P>
<P>
   Women still trail in earnings
</P>
<P>
   Despite three decades of political promises and efforts to
create better anti-discrimination laws, the wage gap between men
and women has narrowed only 15 cents, Working Woman (August) says
in its 20th annual salary survey.
</P>
<P>
   Women now earn 74 cents to every $1 earned by men, up from 59
cents in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are just beginning to gain ground in many male-dominated
career fields, such as science, management, sports and the clergy,
but still earn significantly less than men in fields traditionally
dominated by women, such as nursing and secretarial work,'' the
magazine reports.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a November survey of Fortune 500 companies, the
magazine found:
</P>
<P>
   _ Female media directors in advertising made 90 percent of what
men make in comparable jobs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Women physicists and astronomers made 75 percent of male
salaries.
</P>
<P>
   _ Men in computer jobs make 15 percent more than women in the
same jobs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Female surgeons earned 77 percent of what male general
surgeons make.
</P>
<P>
   _ Women lawyers were paid 70 cents for every dollar a firm paid
male lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Worth mentioning . . .
</P>
<P>
   _ Bloomberg Personal Finance (July/August) focuses its
semiannual mutual fund edition on high-return funds that offer
``superior investment management,'' but that manage to hold their
costs _ and fees _ down.
</P>
<P>
   _ The presidential election is more than a year away but Fortune
(July 19) says the 2000 campaign is already ``awash in cash.'' The
Republicans have a new $30 million ``soft-money'' fund that should
help Texas Gov. George W. Bush, while Democrat Bill Bradley has
raised enough to keep his bid alive should Vice President Al Gore
stumble, the magazine says.

BABES OR BOOTERS? SOCCER TEAM DIVIDED ON THE DIRECTION OF THEIR
IMAGE-MAKING 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Each night on his television show, David Letterman
has been showing a picture of the American women's soccer team, in
which the players are standing shoulder to shoulder like beauty
contestants and appear to be wearing nothing more than ``Late
Show'' T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soccer Moms?'' the show's announcer says as a headline flashes
on the screen. ``Soccer Mamas!''
</P>
<P>
   The players sent him the picture and they love the bit.
Letterman has proclaimed himself the team owner and spiritual guru
and has given the American women attention they could never have
expected. But, however funny, the comedy routine speaks to a larger
issue of how the team is being portrayed to the American public as
it prepares to face China on Saturday in the final of the Women's
World Cup at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   To a large extent, the players have been willing participants in
the sexualization of the team in recent years. Mia Hamm has been
named one of People magazine's 50 most beautiful people. Defender
Brandi Chastain has appeared in Gear magazine, crouched behind a
soccer ball, wearing only her cleats and her rippling muscles.
Goalkeeper Briana Scurry streaked naked through a side street in
Athens, Ga., wearing only her gold medal at the 1996 Summer
Olympics. Co-captain Julie Foudy has posed with her husband for
Sports Illustrated's swimsuit issue and has jokingly referred to
the team as ``booters with hooters.''
</P>
<P>
   With their ponytailed-virtuosity, the American players have also
sent a calculated message around the world that women can be both
athletic and feminine in a sport that, in many places, still
carries the stigma that women who play are somehow unwomanly.
</P>
<P>
   Such portrayals have sparked a debate among some team members,
soccer officials and journalists, at the heart of which are two
questions: Have we reached the point where women can show a sexual
side and still be taken seriously as athletes? Or, is it still
necessary to use sex to sell women's sports, soccer in particular,
and does that trivialize the considerable skills of the players?
</P>
<P>
   ``At least people know who we are now,'' said Scurry. ``I don't
think you have to run around naked to sell the game, but it's good
to at least be on the minds of people. I don't think it's
degrading. People who see us on Letterman and come to the game will
realize we don't just strut around in our little skirts. Women play
as hard as anybody.''

 LOS ANGELES: as anybody. '' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The issue of blending athleticism with a sexual presence comes
at an important moment when women's sports are booming at all
levels, and when the women's national team has established itself
at relevant points all over the cultural map.
</P>
<P>
   _ In setting new attendance records for women's sports and
drawing television ratings higher than hockey received during the
Stanley Cup playoffs, the American team has become a marketer's
dream with skilled, college-educated, funny, accessible and
attractive players.
</P>
<P>
   _ As members of the first generation of female athletes to fully
benefit from Title IX, which essentially forbid discrimination on
the basis of gender, they are role models for adolescent girls who
attend matches after appearing to have had their red, white and
blue faces painted by Betsy Ross herself.
</P>
<P>
   _ As wage earners, they underscore the disparity in pay for
women and men that remains an urgent issue in the workplace, and
most recently, cropped up as a contentious element in the Wimbledon
tennis championships. The American women would receive $12,500 for
winning the World Cup, compared with $20,000 the American men
received for simply making the 1998 men's World Cup tournament and
the $388,000 apiece they would have received for winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think about it, the women are being discounted,'' said
Billie Jean King, the tennis great and activist who has become a
confidant of Foudy, the American co-captain.
</P>
<P>
   _ As a homogenous group of mostly white women in ponytails, they
point up the limited progress soccer has made in casting a talent
net that would include more black and Hispanic players. Only two
members of the women's national team are black, the goalkeepers
Scurry and Saskia Webber.
</P>
<P>
   The sexual element of the team's portrayal stems from a sense of
self-assurance and confidence the players possess, Foudy said. No
doubt, the players have been able to pull this off, first and
foremost, because they have been successful, having won the
inaugural Women's World Cup in 1991 and an Olympic gold medal in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're never going to escape sexual references with women,''
Foudy said. ``If we can make sure we're successful on the field, I
think people will come for the product, rather than what the
product looks like.''
</P>
<P>
   However, midfielder Michelle Akers, the first great star of the
U.S. team, said she had some concerns about how the Americans were
being depicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a bit uncomfortable with Brandi's deal,'' Akers said.
``Everybody has to make their own decisions on how they want to be
portrayed. Regardless of that, it has a reflection on us as a team
and women's sports as a whole. You don't want something like that
to detract from the excellence of this team and the message that
we're striving to put out.''
</P>
<P>
   Chastain has said repeatedly that she posed for Gear magazine to
show her body as the instrument of her talent and to send a message
that women athletes can be strong, confident and unashamed of their
physiques. It is a message that some of America's top female track
and field stars are trying to conveying by posing for a nude
calendar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think these women feel strongly about breaking stereotypes
that a female athlete cannot also be an attractive, feminine
woman,'' said Marla Messing, president of the Women's World Cup
organizing committee. ``They are attractive and they're not afraid
to be strong and aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Some women interviewed at matches during the World Cup, however,
said they were concerned about what kind of message this portrays
to young girls who idolize the American players. Gwen Knapp, a
columnist for the San Francisco Examiner who has been critical of
the focus on the players physiques, said she believed the Women's
World Cup is being played ``like the talent competition in the Miss
American pageant, rather than as a sporting event.''
</P>
<P>
   King, who founded the Women's Sports Foundation, said that the
issue of posing for a magazine is a matter of individual choice,
``as long as we don't take away from the reason they're there in
the first place. The most important thing is not to diminish our
skills as athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   While she has occasionally commented during tennis telecasts
about male players being good looking, King said, ``with women it's
always there. We're kind of like sex objects first. That should be
second, third or 10th. I'm not saying it's not part of every human
being, but it shouldn't be emphasized.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said that she was concerned that female athletes feel
pressured to conform to the idealized version of bouncy femininity
represented by the pony-tailed figure that is the official Women's
World Cup logo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sportswriters still ask us about sexuality; they don't ask
men,'' King said. ``We're under a lot more scrutiny. I think it's a
way to keep women powerless, discounted. It has to change. We have
to get on with it. Women still get nervous, feeling they have to
stay feminine.''
</P>
<P>
   There is another vital subtext in play in the portrayal of the
American team _ skin color. ``The question needs to be asked, would
this team be receiving all this attention if they looked like the
Brazilian women's national team _ boyish, wholly unglamorous and
black?'' said David Hirshey, the executive editor of HarperCollins,
which published an instructional book by Hamm called ``Go For the
Goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the rest of the world, where soccer is a city game, in
the United States, women's soccer at the grassroots level is
largely middle class and upper middle class, suburban and largely
white.
</P>
<P>
   The national soccer federation has admitted that it has done an
inadequate job finding more black and Hispanic players, and has
begun a program to build 500 new soccer fields in the next five
years. Scurry, who gives clinics in the inner city, she said she
hopes African-American kids have seen her play this summer and will
be encouraged to give soccer a try.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about giving kids choices,'' Scurry said. ``You've
got to go in the inner city, where the African American and
Hispanic athletes are. You've got to get people out there finding
the talent. Then you'll have a better depiction of the country as a
whole at some point.''

BRAZILIAN PRESIDENT HURT BY HIS COALITION'S LACK OF HARMONY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ The Brazilian Congress has adjourned
for a midwinter recess, and probably no one is happier than
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who has repeatedly seen his
political program and personal prestige sapped by partisan
squabbling among the parties that supposedly support him.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of approving bills, lawmakers have been fighting over
government appointments, grandstanding at hearings and maneuvering
for advantage in next year's municipal elections and the battle to
succeed Cardoso in 2002. As a result, critical legislation needed
to keep Brazil on track for an economic rescue package signed with
the International Monetary Fund late last year are stalled, with
little prospect of passage.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Cardoso's difficulties may stem from the difficulty of
holding together a fractious four-party coalition with no common
ideology. But he has also shown himself reluctant to knock heads
and exert his authority, both his supporters and critics complain,
when nominal allies misbehave or fail to keep promises.
</P>
<P>
   One consequence is that Cardoso's personal popularity is rapidly
eroding. In a recent poll, 51 percent of the respondents described
the president's job performance as ``bad'' or ``terrible,''
compared with only 23 percent who expressed disapproval in
December, a month before he was sworn in for his second term and
Brazil's currency was devalued by 40 percent, setting off the
financial crisis he is now trying to stem.
</P>
<P>
   Columnist Luis Fernando Verissimo wrote satirically in June that
the main problem with Cardoso, a former sociology professor, is the
appearance that ``in power he is acting like an intellectual.''
After five years, he wrote, Cardoso resembles one of those
impractical types ``who end up being manipulated by less
intelligent but more crafty persons, who let the intellectuals make
the speeches while they govern the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Lacking gusto for the political fray, Cardoso has needed to rely
heavily on Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, a 71-year-old senator who has
been an astute player of power and influence for more than 30
years. But the President has paid a high price, ceding Magalhaes
carte blanche to pursue pet peeves and projects that clash with the
government's goals and timetable.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among these has been a parliamentary inquiry into the
corrupt and inefficient Brazilian judiciary. Since the courts are
immensely unpopular and the subject generates headlines, senators
have rallied enthusiastically to it, at the expense of crucial
electoral and tax reform packages that Cardoso has made the
centerpiece of his second term.
</P>
<P>
   ``The investigations have been a considerable distraction, with
a lot of fireworks and more to come,'' said Dr. David Fleischer, a
political analyst and professor at the National University of
Brasilia. ``They are necessary, but the down side is that the
Supreme Court is under heavy fire and striking back'' at a time
when the constitutionality of some of Cardoso's previous economic
reform measures is still in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian analysts say that both Magalhaes, known sometimes by
his initials ACM, and his rivals have been using the hearings to
position themselves for the next round of elections. Though Cardoso
has three and a half years left to serve in his second term, the
struggle to succeed him is already well under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``ACM's top objective is to stay in the limelight and project
himself nationally,'' said Alexandre Barros, director of an
influential political newsletter and consulting firm in Brasilia.
``He wants to be a candidate for President in 2002, or at least be
the big broker, and so he needs to grow his own strength and
diminish that of others.''
</P>
<P>
   A natural presidential candidate for Cardoso's own Brazilian
Social Democracy Party would be Mario Covas, governor of Sao Paulo,
the country's largest and richest state. But Covas is battling
cancer, and so half a dozen other governors and senators are
jockeying for advantage by putting together their own slates of
candidates in mayoral elections scheduled for next year.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting among pro-government parties has also worsened
longstanding tensions between the two chambers of Congress. That
culminated in a remarkable public exchange of personal insults in
mid-June between Magalhaes and the Speaker of the lower house,
Michel Temer, a member of another party that is also an important
government ally.
</P>
<P>
   Resentful that the lower chamber wanted to move in on his
investigation of the judiciary, Magalhaes said that ``worrying
about moral matters was never Michel Temer's strong point.'' Temer
shot back that ``when it comes to morality, I have Antonio Carlos
beat 10 to nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso has sought to end the squabbling, but only belatedly and
halfheartedly. After a five-hour meeting with the President on June
20, his main political operative, Communications Minister Joao
Pimenta da Veiga, announced ``new rules of behavior'' in an attempt
to bring the allied parties into line.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech here a day later, Cardoso said that decisions taken
by his government ``cannot go on being contested by anybody at any
time.'' Since then, he has dismissed the entire board of a
state-owned bank that had gone to court to challenge a financial
transactions tax the president persuaded Congress to pass in
January. There is also widespread speculation that he will announce
a wholesale Cabinet reshuffle during the winter recess.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a coach replace the whole team in the middle
of a game,'' Covas said Tuesday, discounting such reports. But then
he added that once changes in the Cabinet are announced he hopes
``it becomes quite clear that the president is in command of the
government'' since ``I do not know today'' who is running the
government team.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in April, Cardoso described his efforts to
reform the electoral system as essential to the modernization of
Brazilian politics, and expressed confidence his bill to introduce
voting by districts and prevent legislators from changing parties
would be passed during this session. He predicted the changes would
reduce the number of political parties in Brazil from more than 20
to a more manageable ``six or seven'' and make it easier for him
and his successors to govern.
</P>
<P>
   But that seems increasingly unlikely now, as does passage of
legislation that would overhaul the tax system. Because the
Brazilian constitution prohibits changes in the electoral system
during the year before an election, the introduction of voting by
districts would have to be approved and on Cardoso's desk by Sept.
30, and there is ``no way you can do a constitutional amendment in
six weeks,'' Fleischer said flatly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that these are the two issues that most
directly touch the interests of politicians,'' Barros said of the
electoral and tax reforms. ``So there is a very strong element of
`what's in this for me or what do I lose.'''

TOYOTA AIMS TO ELIMINATE SENIORITY AS A SALARY CRITERIA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Toyota Motor &UR;  &LR; Corp., Japan's largest car maker, is
negotiating with its union to eliminate seniority as a major factor
in determining the salaries of white-collar workers.
</P>
<P>
   If the company is successful, it may influence the pay practices
of companies across Japan, particularly because Hiroshi Okuda,
Toyota's chairman, is also chairman of the Japan Federation of
Employers' Associations.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has been grappling for ways to mobilize its labor force to
help the country climb out of its worst recession since the end of
World War II. Worker productivity has stagnated under a system of
lifetime employment buttressed by wages that rise in lockstep with
tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies, including Toyota, have tied the salaries of top
managers to performance, and a few, like Fujitsu, have abolished
seniority pay, but the system is still largely in place. At the
same time, companies must work harder than ever to retain talented
younger employees, who are increasingly rejecting the security of
lifetime employment with a single company in favor of employment
that offers pay and other rewards based on skills and merit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like the new system to revitalize young, white-collar
employees who have good skills and perform well,'' said Tetsuo
Kitagawa, a spokesman for Toyota.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, which affects about 20,000 of the company's
70,000 white-collar workers, compensation would be partly based on
individual capability, regardless of age or tenure at Toyota.
</P>
<P>
   The union is not likely to oppose Toyota's plans. ``It's better
because it rewards performance while protecting job security,''
Akio Nishida, a spokesman for Toyota's union, was quoted by
Bloomberg News. ``Toyota will protect employment to the greatest
extent possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has assured labor representatives that factors like
expertise and specialization, which in many cases reflect tenure,
will still play a role in determining income for the group in
question, Kitagawa said.

   NEW YORK _ Whenever central casting is called on to fill the
role of a Holocaust survivor, rarely does it cast against type.
Indeed, whether onstage or in films, the Holocaust survivor is
often reduced to a one-dimensional cliche, a cartoon of a stock
character that seems to dominate the perceptions of those in the
dramatic arts. Apparently, filmmakers and playwrights like their
Holocaust survivors tortured, tyrannical and delusional _ often all
at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The cast of film characters in desperate need of a mental health
professional includes Sol Nazerman (Rod Steiger) in ``The
Pawnbroker'' (1965); Arthur Goldman (Maximilian Schell) in ``The
Man in the Glass Booth'' (1975); Peter Helfgott (Armin
Mueller-Stahl) in ``Shine'' (1996), and Isaac Geldhart (Ron Rifkin)
in ``The Substance of Fire'' (1996). (Both ``The Man in the Glass
Booth'' and ``The Substance of Fire'' were originally plays, with
the lead actors reprising their roles in the film versions.)
</P>
<P>
   These are all lifeless men, unfixably broken, unrelievedly angry
and volatile; they are self-pitying, incapable of experiencing love
or generating any emotions other than bitterness, isolation and
rage. Worst of all, in some horrifying act of poetic injustice,
they are presented to the audience as persecutors themselves, men
as sadistic and numb as the Nazis and, for the most part,
completely undeserving of sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, women have not fared much better in this regard.
Henya (Gila Almagor) in ``Summer of Aviya'' (1988) and Masha (Lena
Olin) in ``Enemies, A Love Story'' (1989) _ both films _ and Rosa
Lublin (Dianne Wiest) in the 1996 play ``The Shawl,'' all prove
that there is gender equality in these fictional portraits: men and
women are deemed equally capable of going crazy after Auschwitz.
(As a Polish Catholic in Auschwitz, Sophie Zawistowska, portrayed
by Meryl Streep in ``Sophie's Choice,'' was not, however, marked
for certain death, as she would have been as a Jew.)
</P>
<P>
   But this facile stereotype seems to be gaining more nuance. Two
1998 foreign movies, ``The Truce'' (Italy) and ``Left Luggage'' (a
Dutch director, international cast) have portrayed Holocaust
survivors with greater emotional depth and complexity: capable of
returning to life; functioning, albeit with idiosyncrasy, and not
insane. There is even a tenuous, and somewhat inflated, sense of
optimism in these portraits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Truce,'' as an example, depicts Primo Levi's
life-affirming return to Italy after his liberation from Auschwitz,
though Levi, many years later, ultimately committed suicide. Last
summer, the Gesher theater company in Israel brought ``Adam
Resurrected'' to the Lincoln Center Festival. The play, while
largely set in an insane asylum, still captured not only the
grotesque aspects of what it meant to survive the camps but also
the possibilities of those lives both before the experience and
after.
</P>
<P>
   In a current play in Manhattan, ``The Gathering'' by Arje Shaw,
a Jewish Repertory Theater production at Playhouse 91, Theodore
Bikel stars as Gabe Stern, a Holocaust survivor of distinctive
emotional range. It is 1985 and Gabe, who was interned at Dachau,
is a sculptor living in New York City and working on a bust of
Muhammad Ali. He is also supposed to be preparing his grandson,
Michael, for his bar mitzvah, but instead is making chicken soup
and indulging the boy in a game of chess. Gabe is full of humor; he
is caring and attentive in ways that surpass the fatherly
affections of his own son, Stuart, a Reagan administration
speechwriter. In fact, Gabe even dances through the movements of a
rap routine in honor of Ali, hardly the choreography associated
with the usual canards about survivors.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic tension of the play ensues when Stuart reveals that
a forthcoming visit to West Germany by the President will include,
as a courtesy to the government, a pilgrimage to Bitburg cemetery,
near Dachau. The visit is to honor German soldiers who are buried
there, even though they include some former SS officers. Because
Stuart chooses to ignore the significance of the visit and his
father's indignant reaction to what the older man perceives as a
sacrilege, Gabe takes Michael to Bitburg to protest the Reagan
decision. Michael is about to receive a very different bar mitzvah,
attended by the ghosts of SS monsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gathering'' is unquestionably a play about healing and
redemption. While Gabe, wrapped in a prayer shawl, unpacks some of
the emotional baggage he has carried for so long, he encounters a
young German guard patrolling the cemetery. The two men bitterly
explore some of the larger questions of guilt, responsibility and
memory, and in doing so take some tentative steps toward mutual
understanding. Despite several heated exchanges, it is clear that
Gabe is not a madman, just someone in pain. And the vigil at
Bitburg makes it possible for this sculptor to finally chip away at
the memories that have hardened into stone over years.
</P>
<P>
   In comparing Gabe to the portrait of the Holocaust survivor in
``Shine,'' Bikel noted: ``I'm not saying there are no tyrannical
Jewish fathers, but even they are rooted in some personal grief. In
`Shine,' there was tyranny without the grief.''
</P>
<P>
   So why has it been so difficult for filmmakers and playwrights
to present more complex and varied images of those who endured the
Holocaust? Were the postwar lives of survivors ever as psychically
dire as these artists would have us believe?
</P>
<P>
   ``Holocaust survivors, and their children for that matter, do
not suffer from disproportionately high rates of mental
disorders,'' said Eva Fogelman, a New York psychologist in private
practice who specializes in Holocaust-related trauma. ``In fact,
oddly enough, psychological research suggests the opposite:
Holocaust survivors have experienced less psychosis, suicide,
neurosis, paranoia and schizophrenia than the general population.
Surely these people have been in anguish and mourning, but that
doesn't mean that they couldn't go on to lead functioning, creative
and meaningful lives.''
</P>
<P>
   In a voyeuristic culture that favors the lurid and bizarre, that
truth may not be entertaining enough. Holocaust survivors,
descended from a nightmarish place, have seen too much, and those
searing images have left them forever contaminated with madness.
While they may now live in the world, they can never again be part
of it. That is the central message of earlier dramas that depicted
Holocaust survivors as metaphorically still imprisoned behind
barbed-wire _ whether in caged pawnshops or glass booths.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, artists who sought to tell stories about the
afterlife of genocide have been loath to tinker with the formula.
But while ``The Gathering'' offers a more searching and textured
vision of the survivor, the extent to which it stretches the canvas
of the post-Holocaust universe seems to have come more by way of
accident than artistic design. The playwright, Shaw, was himself a
casualty of the Holocaust. Born in 1941, he hid with his parents in
Tashkent, then part of the Soviet Union, while his paternal
grandparents fell victim to the Nazis in Poland. Yet Shaw did not
set out to write a Holocaust play, he said, but rather one that
explores the relationship between fathers and sons and the ways
that men express themselves through anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to confess that I've seen very little Holocaust art,''
Shaw said. ``I never connected myself to these earlier artistic
representations. The fact that people view this as a Holocaust
drama is ancillary to what I had set out to do, because I had
universal themes in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Bikel and the play's director, Rebecca Taylor, agree that the
aim was not to shatter old stereotypes or conceive new strategies
for depicting what was required to rebuild life after mass death.
``If I had stopped to look at the impact of this play on the
creation of Holocaust art, I would have become too humbled and
humiliated,'' Ms. Taylor said. ``I would have simply gone back to
Indiana.''
</P>
<P>
   And that may be the deepest emotional truth of all. Examining
atrocity with fresh insight is beyond the aspirations of many
artists. Yet inadvertently perhaps, Shaw has demonstrated a
possible shift in the way some Holocaust stories can be told. This
may have more to do with his legacy as the child of a survivor than
any artistic muse, but perhaps that itself is fitting. The
Holocaust as material for the making of art has always presented
Medusa-esque risks: the subject is simply too terrible to confront
directly. Domesticating horror _ making it familiar _ is not for
everyone; human beings often cope better by putting distance
between themselves and what frightens them. Isn't that why some
people go to the theater and movies in the first place: the images
may be disturbing but can ultimately be left there. That is
precisely what audiences have been able to do over the years with
stereotypes of Holocaust survivors. Aliens from Planet Auschwitz
were as unreal as any other close encounter we could imagine.
</P>
<P>
   But wouldn't it be better if we returned home knowing a little
more about the actual lives of those whose experiences have been
fictionalized for our entertainment? Yes, many Holocaust survivors
endured unspeakable horrors. And yes, while their bodies were
liberated, their minds would never know an equivalent freedom. But
these were minds _ without pathology though ruled by memory _ that
were still capable of embracing more. And that is how life,
tentatively and miraculously, can start over.

NATO RELUCTANTLY DEALS WITH TOP SERB OFFICIAL IN KOSOVO
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ It is one of the ironies of peace
enforcement here that NATO soldiers, called in Friday night to
protect Serbian representatives of the Yugoslav government, shot
dead two young heroes of the Kosovo Albanian rebel movement.
</P>
<P>
   The young men were out in the street celebrating. Inside the
building was Zoran Andjelkovic, one of the organizers of the ethnic
discrimination and suppression of Albanians in Kosovo during the
last decade and a proven and loyal ally of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, Andjelkovic is still in town. He still calls himself
the prime minister of Kosovo, and he continues to live and work in
the Executive Council Building at the top of Pristina's main
street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a secretary,'' he complained loudly as he hunted
for a letter in an office adjoining his during a recent interview.
``I don't have a driver.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of his staff members have left the province. Yet
Andjelkovic, a short man dressed casually in a nylon bomber jacket,
says he intends to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal plan is not to leave before the situation is
stabilized,'' he said. ``If I leave, all the non-Albanian
population will leave.''
</P>
<P>
   So far NATO, the United Nations and the returning Albanians
appear to be tolerating his slow departure. British paratroops
guard the entrance of the building. They are there to stop the
removal of documents, but they have ended up protecting one of the
most despised men in the province.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the U.N. mission still have dealings with him. He
is useful for information about how to run the utilities and other
services, they say. One official called dealing with his
administration a necessary evil.
</P>
<P>
   Andjelkovic has kept busy trying to encourage the Serbian
population in Kosovo to stay. He may have other reasons for
staying, foreign officials here say, like making sure that the
Yugoslav government maintains a voice in affairs in Kosovo, and
sending information back to the capital.
</P>
<P>
   His office was reported to have been shredding documents and
transporting large amounts of paper back to Belgrade _ for
safekeeping, Andjelkovic said. Those reports sent the United
Nations into action, and it requested NATO soldiers to guard his
office.
</P>
<P>
   Andjelkovic, who was appointed the top government official in
Kosovo last October, was present throughout the apparent Serbian
campaign of killings and expulsions of Kosovo Albanians of the last
few months.
</P>
<P>
   He plays down his role, contending that he has had little
influence on decision-making and no part in military or police
operations. ``This institution never had objective power,'' he
said. ``Orders always came direct from the ministries in Belgrade,
and we were just coordinating things.''
</P>
<P>
   During the NATO bombing campaign, the government in Belgrade
declared a state of war, giving extensive powers to the military
over the civilian authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as a member of the Serbian Socialist Party, Milosevic's
party, Andjelkovic would have retained considerable power. In
Serbia the Socialists, the successor of the Communists, tend to
dictate policy. Andjelkovic did carry out Belgrade's directives,
including the order to expel foreign journalists from Kosovo on
March 25.
</P>
<P>
   His role in Kosovo goes a long way back. Albanian politicians
and civil servants here name him as one of a number of vigorous
Serbian activists used by Milosevic to subvert the stature and
self-government of Kosovo Albanians in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic prepared a crew of people to throw Albanians out of
their jobs, to grab control of institutions'' for the Socialists,
``and in this crew was Andjelkovic,'' said Belul Beqaj, a Kosovo
Albanian who is a political analyst and journalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything took a new turn with a new law on June 26, 1990,''
Beqaj recalled, referring to a law that brought the province more
tightly under Belgrade's control. ``From that day the whole legal
system was broken, Parliament was suspended, the workers were
thrown out and the executive government stopped. From that base
Serbs could do what they wanted. Andjelkovic contributed to this.''
</P>
<P>
   Today Andjelkovic concedes that the policy of the Socialists has
proved disastrous for Kosovo, and in particular for the Serbs
living there. Yet he denies personal responsibility. ``I did not
choose the party,'' he said. ``It chose me.''
</P>
<P>
   He contends that he tried to stop the flow of expulsions by
trying to persuade fleeing Albanians to return home but that his
actions had little effect.
</P>
<P>
   Albanians say he did little to stop the violence or to alleviate
their suffering. His office, they say, failed to provide basic
protection or even supplies of bread.
</P>
<P>
   Zejnullah Gruda, a Kosovo Albanian who is a law professor and
vice president of the Council for Human Rights in Pristina, has no
doubt that Andjelkovic bears responsibility for much of the
suffering of Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   He referred to a book by a 17th-century Dutch jurist, Hugo
Grotius, called ``On the Law of War and Peace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It says responsibility lies with people who fail to prevent
when it is their duty to prevent,'' Gruda said. ``For many months
he was the leader of the government. He has responsibility _ he did
nothing to stop it.''

GRANDMA'S HOUSE IS A MEMORY MAKER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: W. Va.)   By MARY J. LOFTUS   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The heat index is 105 in the shade, so I'm sitting in a lawn
chair in my grandmother's root cellar, where it's at least 20
degrees cooler.
</P>
<P>
   The Fourth in Ripley, W.Va., this year has been a flop, with
sweltering heat, no rain, brown grass and a series of mishaps. The
annual fireworks tonight might set the town on fire, the way things
are going.
</P>
<P>
   I'm enjoying every minute of it.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, Jim and I swear we won't be coming back to the farm
in the summer anymore. It's too hot, too long a drive over a
holiday weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, each year, we load up the car and make the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Grandma has been dead two years now, and we're renting out the
century-old white farmhouse to my best friend, her husband and
their two young sons.
</P>
<P>
   At first, it was disconcerting to see the changes they've made,
even in the name of progress. The fading wallpaper ripped down and
replaced with drywall. The new carpet in the kitchen, over the top
of the worn linoleum. The mirror missing from the wall beside the
porch door.
</P>
<P>
   But the house also has been shored up, treated for termites,
patched and painted.
</P>
<P>
   All my grandmother's possessions, accumulated over 93 years,
have been sorted and stored or given away. Still, items rise from
the house like excavated treasures.
</P>
<P>
   Just yesterday, I found her school teacher's manual for first to
third grades, with her neat handwriting on the front.
</P>
<P>
   A diary entry was written on the inside back page from March 26,
1930. She may not have known yet that she was nearly two months
pregnant with my mother, her first child. ``The worst day of the
year. Snowing and blowing like 60. Over town and down the road last
night. Mayme, Geneva and I. Sure did hail some on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, 70 years and a season later, we have set the record for the
hottest day, coming full circle.
</P>
<P>
   The kids, sweaty but happy, have indulged in cotton candy and
kiddy rides at the carnival, run barefoot rings around the house,
splashed in well water pumped up from the spring. They've been
chased by a black snake, brought home a box turtle and spied a deer
in the field.
</P>
<P>
   The parents have hit the Cedar Lake Arts and Crafts Fair and the
flea market, buying patchwork pillows, garden candles, Chicago
World's Fair postcards, a fortune teller's teacup from England.
</P>
<P>
   We talk about grandmother, and how she would feel about the
farmhouse now _ happy that children are playing in the side yard,
mad that we rearranged her kitchen counters, perplexed by the
satellite dish propped outside the guest room window.
</P>
<P>
   My fear was that this house would set empty and have to be torn
down, a victim of neglect. Houses, I think, can die of loneliness
just like dogs and people, and I will be forever grateful to my
friends for moving their lives into this one.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that night on the porch swing, I reach out to my
grandmother for her approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you think, Grandma Freda?'' I ask.
</P>
<P>
   Here was her reply: The leaves rustling, the swing's chain
creaking, the cattle lowing and the whippoorwills repeating their
soft eventide song.

DOUBLING UP ON STAR POWER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., July 11)  
(jt) 
 By LAWRENCE A. JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since the dawn of recording, combining two popular opera singers
in an album has often proved a canny business venture. From Caruso
and Farrar to Callas and di Stefano, Pavarotti and Sutherland, and
Alagna and Gheorghiu, record buyers have responded enthusiastically
to the sparks that can ignite when two musical artists with
distinctive voices, personalities and interpretive styles come
together.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in addition, label executives undoubtedly hope that in
generating such sparks, they can steal or at least borrow the fire
of the Three Tenors. Or so it appears from a handful of new CD's
pairing some of the day's most celebrated opera singers in operatic
selections and song.
</P>
<P>
   The release most heavily flogged is ``Cecilia and Bryn,''
featuring, of course, Cecilia Bartoli and Bryn Terfel (Decca/London
289 458 928-2). Highly gifted and intelligent, these singers also
present two of the most ebullient personalities on a musical stage
today, and the temptation to indulge in a tractor pull of musical
charisma was evidently irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   The music, in any case, seems almost ancillary to the
People-magazine-style presentation; only on the back cover does a
potential buyer learn that the repertory consists of selections
from Mozart and bel canto operas. There are no texts or
translations; instead, color photographs show the lovable musical
scamps and Myung-Whun Chung, the conductor, enjoying ice cream
cones and gamboling in Roman piazzas.
</P>
<P>
   Mozart makes up the lion's share of the program, starting with a
kind of suite of Susanna's and Figaro's material from Act I of ``Le
Nozze di Figaro.'' In the theater, Terfel's bluff and characterful
Figaro is a popular commodity, combining refined singing with a
winning stage presence. But here, both artists' big personalities
tend to crowd out Mozart. Terfel's ``Se vuol ballare'' is more
notable for burly vehemence than for elegant vocalism.
</P>
<P>
   Terfel changes caste with characteristic ease, adopting a darker
vocal timbre for the Count's aria. And the Count's Act III duet
with Susanna seems utterly natural in expression. Ms. Bartoli
tosses off ``Un moto di gioia'' with characteristic flair and lilt.
</P>
<P>
   Her achievements in Rossini and bel canto literature are widely
heralded, and her rapid-fire fioritura in the Act I duet from ``Il
Barbiere di Siviglia'' is jaw-dropping in its machine-tooled
accuracy. Terfel is less comfortable in this repertory, yet he
lightens his imposing instrument and sings with agility. Adina and
Dulcamara's duet in Donizetti's ``Elisir d'Amore'' is done with
fine panache.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the good things here, it all comes back to a marked
surfeit of characterization at the expense of the music. Sudden
drops or swells in dynamics preclude a sustained line, making a
hash of Mozart's vocal writing. After a vibrant recitative, ``Il
core vi dono'' from ``Cosi Fan Tutte'' loses much of its freshness
to nudge-nudge, wink-wink hesitations and elastic legato. You are
unlikely to hear the Papageno-Papagena duet dispatched with greater
fleetness, but whether such an aggressive race serves the music is
another question.
</P>
<P>
   The Orchestra dell'Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia plays
well enough for Chung, but a more dominating podium figure might
have insisted on fuller note values and reined in some of the
vocalists' interpretive excesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star-Crossed Lovers,'' from Placido Domingo and Renee Fleming
(Decca/London 289 460 793-2), offers similarly mixed rewards. The
album stems primarily from a 1998 concert in Chicago, which was
telecast last Valentine's Day on PBS. Ill-fated love may be the
theme, but an ill-fated, populist hodgepodge is what emerges. The
program lurches drunkenly from ``West Side Story'' to Gounod, from
Carlos Gardel and Duke Ellington to Lehar and Verdi.
</P>
<P>
   Although both singers are in excellent voice, in ``Tonight'' and
``Somewhere'' from ``West Side Story'' Ms. Fleming is too operatic
and heavily expressive in manner.
</P>
<P>
   Domingo's timbre possesses an inherent dramatic quality, which
makes him a compelling Otello in a Verdi excerpt but works against
him in lighter settings, his ``Three Tenors'' success
notwithstanding. He clearly loves zarzuela and lighter Spanish
repertory, yet his singing of works like Federico Moreno Torroba's
``Jota Castellana'' sounds weighty and stolid.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fleming's Ellington set seems too great a stylistic stretch
even for this versatile artist. The vocal swellings and dynamic
drops of ``In a Sentimental Mood'' sound practiced and unnatural,
and ``Do Nothin' Till You Hear From Me'' is rather arch.
</P>
<P>
   In love duets from Gounod's ``Faust'' and Verdi's ``Otello,''
both singers are more in their element: Ms. Fleming is girlish and
impetuous as Marguerite and Domingo predictably commanding in his
signature role of Otello. Still, despite solid support from Daniel
Barenboim and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, this disappointing
disk adds up to less than the sum of its dizzyingly variegated
parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Belleezza Vocale'' features Jennifer Larmore and Hei-Kyung
Hong in a program of duets for mezzo-soprano and soprano (Teldec
3984-22801-2). As the title suggests, the emphasis is on the
lyrical. Ms. Larmore's attractive timbre and Ms. Hong's bright tone
blend gracefully, and indeed, much lovely singing is on display.
</P>
<P>
   Yet enticing as the vocalism is, a feeling of blandness emerges
over the course of the recording. In contrast to Terfel and Ms.
Bartoli, Ms. Larmore and Ms. Hong concentrate on streamlined tonal
beauty and a well-sustained line at the expense of
characterization. Listen to Elisabeth Schwarzkopf and Irmgard
Seefried in this repertory to find the spirited interplay missing
here.
</P>
<P>
   The hushed awe of nature in Delibes' ``Lakme'' is
indistinguishable from Norma and Adalgisa's female bonding in the
Bellini opera; generalized ardor is made to serve for any
quicksilver rush or spark of personality. The two extended dramatic
scenes from Donizetti's ``Anna Bolena'' and Rossini's ``Tancredi,''
clearly meant to provide dramatic ballast, are the least successful
items, lacking fire and intensity.
</P>
<P>
   The evening hymn from Humperdinck's ``Haensel und Gretel'' could
hardly be sung more gorgeously, but anyone looking for more than
surface charm will search in vain. Jesus Lopez-Cobos' dull and
literal conducting of the Munich Radio Orchestra contributes to the
feeling of lethargy.
</P>
<P>
   The disk that provides the most consistent musical rewards is
``No Tenors Allowed,'' featuring Thomas Hampson and Samuel Ramey in
a program of duets for baritone and bass (Teldec 0630-13149-2). The
booklet notes' attempts at whimsy bode ill, proclaiming the merits
of lower voices over those of tenors. ``Basses create a picture of
self-assured masculinity'' the annotator prattles, and baritones
and basses _ presumably unlike those pantywaist tenors _ ``are real
men.'' What might one give to see Ben Heppner drop-kick the
perpetrator of those fatuities?
</P>
<P>
   But the disk itself is largely successful, offering choice
rarities among the few well-known, predominantly dramatic offerings
for baritone and bass. Ramey, divorced on records from his
commanding stage presence, sometimes projects a generalized
vehemence, but here he is more varied in expression. Although
Hampson sounds stretched at the top of his range and
uncharacteristically husky at times, he sings with his customary
intelligence and commitment. The extended heroic scenes from
Bellini's ``Puritani'' and Donizetti's rarely heard ``Marino
Faliero'' come off well.
</P>
<P>
   Both singers are at their finest in the second half of the
program, devoted to Verdi selections. The ``Don Carlos'' and
``Simon Boccanegra'' scenes benefit from their stage experience.
Yet surprisingly, the famous buffa duet of Malatesta and Don
Pasquale in the Donizetti opera turns out to be the highlight of
the disk. Both singers relax into fine buffa style, spinning out
the fioritura with theatrical panache; their delightful performance
is one of the most enjoyable on disk since the classic 1932
rendition by Ernesto Badini and Afro Poli.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Gomez-Martinez and the Munich Radio Orchestra provide
fine, spirited orchestral support. On the debit side, Teldec
continues its inscrutable policy of supplying texts only in the
original languages, without translations, a self-defeating economy
for a full-price release featuring rare repertory.

   COLOMBIA: PEACE TALKS POSTPONED
</P>
<P>
   The start of formal peace talks between the government and the
main left-wing guerrilla group has been postponed for two weeks.
The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia said some members of
their delegation were unable to reach the site of the talks, but a
joint communique also made it clear the two sides had been unable
to agree on the role to be played by a team of international
monitors.

   ARGENTINA: TAKING ON THE TRUCKERS
</P>
<P>
   Facing possible food shortages in the nation's cities, the
cabinet met to discuss various options for ending a work action by
thousands of truckers blocking roads to protest a new vehicle tax
intended to raise the salaries of public school teachers. One
option being discussed was to deploy police and military units to
accompany truckers willing to cross roadblocks that have been set
up in at least five provinces.

   MEXICO: POLITICAL SPENDING LIMITS
</P>
<P>
   The governing party set a $5.8 million spending limit for each
of the four party leaders campaigning for its presidential
nomination but also announced it will not try to punish those who
spend more. The party has scheduled its first primary for Nov. 7.
Mexican campaign finance laws place no restrictions on fund-raising
by the seven politicians seeking the presidency until they register
officially next January as major party candidates.

<P>
   Opposition parties in the state of Mexico will contest the
results of the election for governor, saying there was widespread
vote-buying and voter coercion. The National Action Party and the
Party of the Democratic Revolution said they would protest through
legal channels on Sunday. The governing Institutional Revolutionary
Party won with 40.7 percent of the vote; National Action was second
with 34.2 percent.

Germany would leave for Iraq on Thursday to help the United Nations
evaluate and dismantle its laboratory in Baghdad. Yielding to
Iraq's demands, the United Nations chose experts who have never
worked for the special commission charged with disarming Iraq of
weapons of mass destruction. Commission inspectors left tiny

HILLARY CLINTON `LISTENING TOUR' HITS UPSTATE NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ONEONTA, N.Y. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton took to the road
Wednesday with the confidence and ease of a fulltime campaigner,
stepping out of her motorcade to shake hands with well-wishers,
smiling to reporters, even admitting that her critics raise a
``legitimate question'' when they call her a ``carpetbagger.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton began the first of a four-day ``listening tour''
across predominantly Republican upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   The morning began with a picture-perfect scene: Senator Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, who is retiring from the seat that Mrs. Clinton
wants to win, endorsed the first lady as the two stood outside his
farmhouse in the hamlet of Pindar's Corners.
</P>
<P>
   After their remarks to a few dozen neighbors, 31 TV cameras and
about 200 reporters, the two walked off together to the house,
flanked by schoolchildren, the rolling hills in the background. It
was a lovely scene, but also, perhaps, the perfect opening frame
for a campaign commercial: a portrait of the torch being passed.
</P>
<P>
   Before that picturesque exit scene, Mrs. Clinton took on her
opponents' most persistent, and, according to opinion polls, most
resonant, line of attack: that she has never lived or worked in New
York and, therefore, should not be New York's senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I suppose the question on everybody's mind,'' she said,
``is, why the Senate and why New York and why me?
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is that I care deeply about the issues that are
important to this state,'' she said, adding her hope that, with
time, New Yorkers will come to agree that ``what I am for is maybe
as important, if not more important, than where I am from.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a line that would be repeated and underscored, by Mrs.
Clinton and her aides throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   She also said the idea of running for Senate had seemed like ``a
strange idea'' at the outset to her. But the more people talked to
me . . . and the more I really understood about the kinds of issues
that New Yorkers are concerned about, the more I really thought I
maybe could make a contribution. . .
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think I have some real work to do to get out and listen
and learn from the people of New York.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, she spent 90 minutes Wednesday afternoon at the
State University of New York at Oneonta, discussing education with
a roomful of teachers, students and local Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very interested in listening and learning,'' she said,
repeating the mantra of the tour.
</P>
<P>
   She cited figures to show that she had studied up on the economy
of upstate New York. She talked children's health insurance and
remedial education. ``Let's find out what works,'' she said at one
point, ``and if it works, fine; if it doesn't, let's move on to
something else.'' To a professor who proposed government funding
for high-speed Internet wiring, she asked, ``Would you mind writing
me up some of your ideas?''
</P>
<P>
   All day, she revealed an open, gregarious, flexible manner that
clearly defied the icy, removed and dogmatic stereotype that has
often haunted her.
</P>
<P>
   Signs and posters, pro and anti, followed her along the highways
everywhere she went Wednesday, but not in any overwhelming number.
</P>
<P>
   The most heated incident took place when she stopped in for
lunch with the mayor of Oneonta at Brooks House of Bar-B-Q. A
customer yelled out, ``Go home!'' Another customer rejoined, ``You
go home!'' The first yelled back, ``I live here! And I'm not
running for senator!'' The shouting-match spread to a dozen
observers.
</P>
<P>
   When she arrived by plane in Binghamton Wednesday morning, a few
protest signs greeted her, most notably someone holding up a carpet
cut up in the shape of Arkansas. But most of the greeters were
positive, with many cries of ``You go, girl!'' and ``Run, Hillary,
run!'' when she got out of her car just outside the airport and
talked with supporters for over five minutes. She got back in the
car, saying, ``Thank you so much.''
</P>
<P>
   She got out of the car again at a rest stop, on her way to
Moynihan's farm, and talked with more people, mainly well-wishers.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan's endorsement of her was a strong one. ``I'm here to
say,'' he said, by way of introducing her, ``that I hope she will
go all the way. I mean to go all the way with her. I think she's
going to win. I think she's going to be wonderful for New York, and
we'll be proud of our Senator and the nation will notice.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, who insists that she is still just ``exploring''
the possibility of running for the office, faces a very close and
possibly brutal race next year, most likely against the Republican
mayor of New York City, Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Most polls show the two candidates running neck and neck, though
Giuliani leads by significant margins outside New York City, which
may be why Mrs. Clinton visdited the very center of the state.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the college campus, she went on to a computer
center and then to the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown.
Thursday she moves on to Rome and Utica, then to Albany.

MOVING ON PEACE, BARAK ANNOUNCES MEETINGS WITH CLINTON, ARAB
LEADERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Moving swiftly to make good on his pledges to
restart the stalled Middle East peace effort, Ehud Barak announced
as he moved into the prime minister's office Wednesday that he
would hold a series of meetings with Arab leaders and President
Clinton in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   Barak plans to meet with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt on
Friday in Alexandria and with Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian
leader, on Sunday at the Erez Crossing between the Gaza Strip and
Israel, a statement from his office said.
</P>
<P>
   A meeting is also planned with King Abdullah of Jordan before
Barak travels to the United States next week for discussions with
Clinton and senior administration officials, the statement added.
Barak is expected in Washington on July 15.
</P>
<P>
   The whirl of diplomacy is intended to explore ways to revive
aborted peace talks with Syria and to move peace efforts forward
with the Palestinians. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is
expected to visit the Middle East to follow up the discussions
after Barak returns from Washington, Israeli officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The new Israeli prime minister is seeking help from the Clinton
administration and from the leaders of Egypt and Jordan, which are
at peace with Israel, to renew negotiations with Syria that were
broken off more than three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``These meetings symbolize Barak's determination to resume the
peace process and renew the relations of trust between the new
Israeli government and Arab leaders,'' said Haim Ramon, a Cabinet
minister who is responsible for Jerusalem issues.
</P>
<P>
   In his inauguration speech Tuesday, Barak pledged to make the
pursuit of peace with the Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon the
``supreme goal'' of his government.
</P>
<P>
   Nabil Shaath, a senior aide to Arafat, welcomed Barak's
announcement of the first meeting between Arafat and an Israeli
leader since last December.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Arafat is quite encouraged by this,'' Shaath said.
``We hope our first meeting will be successful and usher in a new
period of relations and partnership between the two leaders, if it
is followed by some practical things on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   In Damascus, a statement read on state television said: ``Syria
shares with Prime Minister Barak the same wish to put an end to
wars and establish comprehensive peace in the region. The Syrian
government is ready to match every step with a similar one and to
resume peace talks from the point where they ended as soon as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Formally taking over Wednesday from his predecessor, Benjamin
Netanyahu, at a ceremony and toast in the prime minister's office,
Barak noted that ``there is tremendous expectation that we will
know, from this room and from this building, how to navigate the
state of Israel and the entire region to security and peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Israeli commentators suggested that Barak was moving
quickly to carry out his peace promises in order to pre-empt
possible resistance from right-leaning members of his broad
governing coalition, which spans 75 members of the 120-member
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Little is known yet about how Barak intends to go about
restoring momentum to negotiations with the Palestinians that
bogged down in distrust and recrimination during Netanyahu's term
as prime minister. At Wednesday's hand-over ceremony, Barak said
that he would try to avoid Netanyahu's mistakes, but did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Netanyahu suspended the latest Israeli-Palestinian
accord, the Wye River agreement signed near Washington last
October, accusing the Palestinians of failing to keep their part of
the deal. The agreement called for a phased Israeli withdrawal from
parts of the West Bank in exchange for Palestinian security
measures.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon said that Barak would seek changes in the Wye agreement,
but only with Palestinian consent. Israeli press reports said that
Barak would prefer to skip further Israeli troop withdrawals and
proceed directly to talks on a permanent peace _ a move that would
leave more land under Israeli control before the hard bargaining on
a final settlement.
</P>
<P>
   However, Shaath predicted that Arafat would reject Barak's
suggestion and insist on full adherence to the Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Arafat will politely and firmly tell him no,''
Shaath said. ``If you say you are not willing to implement
agreements that have been signed, how will I trust you to implement
anything in the future? If he says I will go through with it as
soon as possible, that's enough.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Shaath said that the Palestinians also expect Barak to halt
Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and
particularly in East Jerusalem. The future of these areas is
supposed to be decided in negotiations on a final peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines of Barak's government say that no new settlements
will be built, but that existing settlements will not be harmed and
their ``development needs'' will be met, a formula that allows for
expansion of these communities.
</P>
<P>
   As for Israeli projects in East Jerusalem, Ramon said Tuesday
that work on a housing complex for Jews in the Arab neighborhood of
Ras al-Amud should be stopped. But he added that building would
proceed at another disputed site, a hill known in Hebrew as Har
Homa and in Arabic as Jabal Abu Ghneim.
</P>
<P>
   As Barak arrived at the prime minister's office Wednesday, other
members of his Cabinet took the reins of their ministries from
their predecessors in ceremonies whose cordiality contrasted with
the rancor of the election campaign that ended with Barak's
resounding victory on May 17.
</P>
<P>
   Barak set the gracious tone by paying warm compliments to
Netanyahu and raising a glass to the departing prime minister and
his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``To Benjamin and Sara Netanyahu and to the state of Israel,''
Barak said. ``To life, l'chayim!''

COMMENTARY: TWO VICTIMS IN BUFFALO  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the evening of May 18, 1982, a woman who was
visiting a nature preserve with her husband in Buffalo, N.Y., was
attacked and raped. The woman had walked away from her husband and
was on an isolated path when the attack occurred. She told police
she had been heading back to their parked car, where she had
planned to sit and read.
</P>
<P>
   The woman was 23 years old and white. She said the man who had
attacked her was black. She got only a glimpse of his face, she
told police, because he was wearing a hooded jacket and had
blindfolded her.
</P>
<P>
   Four and a half months later, police picked up Vincent Jenkins,
a 43-year-old black man who would never qualify for a good
citizenship award. He had been involved in the illegal numbers game
and had served a prison sentence for a manslaughter conviction in
the early '70s. (His lawyer had argued that the killing was in
self-defense, and Jenkins had in fact been cut with a knife in the
fatal encounter, but a jury convicted him anyway.)
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins was taken by investigators to a police garage where he
was viewed by the victim through a one-way glass. She had been told
that he was a suspect. She looked at him for more than 15 minutes
but was unable to identify him as the man who had raped her.
</P>
<P>
   The police then showed the victim a four-year-old photo of
Jenkins. They told her it was a current photo. They allowed her to
look at Jenkins again. Finally she said yes, he was the man who had
attacked her.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins was arrested and charged with rape.
</P>
<P>
   The trial court ruled that the initial identification process
had been unconstitutionally suggestive, so the ``evidence'' from
that process _ the viewing of Jenkins in the garage, the
four-year-old photo _ was excluded from the trial. But the victim
was allowed to testify that Jenkins was the man who had raped her.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins' current lawyer, the Manhattan attorney Eleanor Jackson
Piel, said, ``The jury believed her, even though his physical
appearance was dramatically different from the description the
victim had originally given the police.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury also disregarded the analysis of hairs found on the
victim that were determined to have come from a black person, but
not from Jenkins.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins was convicted and sentenced to 20 years to life in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '90s Ms. Piel contacted the lawyer Barry Scheck,
who has pioneered the use of DNA testing in criminal cases. At
their request, the court ruled that evidence originally collected
as part of the so-called rape kit be submitted for DNA testing.
This was done over the objections of the Erie County district
attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   The test was inconclusive. Nothing in the test results pointed
to Jenkins as the rapist, but some of the results were confusing.
That was in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   By the late '90s the DNA testing procedures had become much more
sophisticated. Another series of tests was done in the Jenkins
case. No one, including the prosecutors, disputes the scientific
accuracy of the tests. Based on material from vaginal and cervical
swabs, the tests showed DNA from two males, which was consistent
with the victim's testimony that she had had sex with her husband
24 hours before she was raped.
</P>
<P>
   The tests unequivocally ruled out Jenkins as the source for any
of the DNA. But they also ruled out the victim's husband. This has
thrown prosecutors into a theoretical tailspin. All sorts of wild
hypotheses are emerging as they search for any scenario that can be
used to keep Jenkins in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Piel and Scheck have asked John Elfvin, a federal judge in
Buffalo, to order the release of their client, who has now spent
nearly 17 years in prison. But prosecutors continue to object. Now
they are suggesting that maybe there were two rapists, or even
three, and that Jenkins was one of them, but that he left no
genetic evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Those hypotheses, born of desperation, are contradicted by the
victim, who said immediately after the attack, and at the trial,
and for all these years, that she had been raped by one man and
that he had ejaculated.
</P>
<P>
   That one man, according to the DNA evidence, was not Vincent
Jenkins.

A MANGO FOR EVERY MOOD 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Photo available on NYT datasbase) 
 
By ANN CRISWELL 
Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   You can devour a mango plain, juice dripping down into the
kitchen sink, or you can glamorize it and present it at a formal
seven-course banquet. In between lie the many moods of mango.
</P>
<P>
   It's exotic in a spicy chutney, salsa or relish; provocative in
hot sauce.
</P>
<P>
   A tropical drink or ice cream displays its refreshing nature.
</P>
<P>
   It's sociable as an ingredient in a quick bread for brunch, a
sauce for grilled spareribs at a cookout or a shrimp salad for a
ladies' lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Enjoy the mango's sophisticated mood in a sorbet or souffl.
</P>
<P>
   Mangoes have so much in common with peaches that you can
substitute equal amounts in most recipes.
</P>
<P>
   But never judge a mango by its color. It can be ripe when it's
all green, yellow and green, yellow and red, or mottled green,
yellow and red-orange. A newly promoted variety, the Champagne
mango from southern Mexico, is pale golden yellow and smaller than
other varieties (it is also less fibrous and has a smaller seed).
</P>
<P>
   Store at room temperature or in a paper bag to ripen.
Refrigerate only after the mango is ripe. They will keep whole in
the refrigerator four or five days. Peeled, sliced mangoes will
keep three to four days. Mangoes also can be frozen in freezer
containers for as long as a year at 0 degrees or lower.
</P>
<P>
   Trust your nose and hands to pick the best mango. It should have
a lush fragrance and yield to gentle pressure but remain firm. Even
a semifirm or half-ripe mango will emit some fruity perfume. Avoid
mangoes with bruises or soft spots.
</P>
<P>
   Be aware that mangoes are messy. (That's why it's the
prerogative and the pleasure of the cook to finish off the mango
over the sink, to get the last blissful bit of flesh clinging to
the seed.)
</P>
<P>
   Be aware also that mangoes are related to poison sumac, and some
people are allergic to the sap. Usually, even those who are
allergic can eat mangoes if someone else picks and peels them.
</P>
<P>
   A medium mango provides about 135 calories. Mangoes are a good
source of vitamins A and C. They are low in sodium and high in
potassium; each cup has about 12 milligrams sodium and 312
milligrams potassium.

   Ribs With Thai Mango Sauce
</P>
<P>
   From ``The Great Ribs Book'' by Hugh Carpenter and Teri Sandison
(Ten Speed Press, $14.95).
</P>
<P>
   2 sides spareribs or your favorite ribs &QL; 
2 ripe mangoes &QL; 
\ cup Thai or Vietnamese fish sauce (available at Asian markets) &QL; 
\ cup each: freshly squeezed lime juice and brown sugar &QL; 
2 tablespoons flavorless cooking oil &QL; 
1 tablespoon Asian chili sauce &QL; 
2 tablespoons finely minced ginger &QL; 
3 garlic cloves, finely minced &QL; 
\ cup chopped cilantro sprigs &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Remove membrane from underside of ribs. Place ribs in
rectangular dish or baking pan.
</P>
<P>
   To make the sauce: Peel mangoes, cut flesh away from seed;
discard seed and peel. Place mango flesh in food processor fitted
with a metal blade; pure. You should have 1 cup pure. Transfer pure
to a bowl; combine with fish sauce, juice, sugar, oil, chili sauce,
ginger, garlic and cilantro. Stir well. Makes 1} cups.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Coat ribs evenly on both sides with half the sauce. Marinate
ribs, refrigerated, at least 15 minutes. For more flavor, marinate
as long as 8 hours. Reserve remaining sauce to serve with the ribs.
</P>
<P>
   To grill ribs: If using a gas barbecue, preheat to medium (325
degrees). If using charcoal or wood, prepare a fire. When coals are
covered with ash, push them to outside of grill. Place a pan of
water in the bottom of the grill among the coals and cover the
coals with the cooking grate. Place a rib rack on the grate and add
the ribs (see note).
</P>
<P>
   Cover grill; regulate heat so it remains at medium temperature.
Occasionally during cooking, baste ribs with extra marinade;
discard remaining marinade. Stop 15 minutes before removing ribs
from grill. Grill ribs until the meat begins to shrink from the
ends of the rib bones. Approximate grilling time for spareribs: 1{
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Cut each side of ribs in half, into 3 sections or into
individual ribs. Transfer to heated platter or 4 heated dinner
plates and serve at once, accompanied with reserved sauce, which
has been heated to boiling. Makes 4 servings.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Note:  &LR; As an alternative, brush cooking grate with flavorless
oil; place ribs, meaty side up, in center of grill. Cover grill and
proceed as directed above.

<P>
   Mango Hot Sauce
</P>
<P>
   From ``Caribbean Light'' by Donna Shields (Doubleday, $25.95).
Made with two staple Caribbean ingredients, mango and Scotch bonnet
pepper, the sauce is slightly sweet because of the mango and
definitely hot because of the pepper. But it isn't a real
blow-your-head-off sauce. Use as an all-purpose condiment, a
dipping sauce for raw oysters, or an add-in for meatloaf, beef stew
or bread stuffing. It makes a perfect hostess gift.
</P>
<P>
   1 cup very ripe, peeled, cubed mango &QL;
</P>
<P>
   cup water &QL; 
2 tablespoons cider vinegar &QL; 
3 garlic cloves, smashed &QL; 
{ Scotch bonnet pepper, finely minced &QL; 
{ teaspoon each: turmeric, ground dry mustard and sugar &QL; 
\ teaspoon salt &QL; 
In a small saucepan, combine mango, water, vinegar, garlic, pepper,
turmeric, dry mustard, sugar and salt. Cover and simmer 30 minutes.
Pour into a food processor or blender; process until smooth and of
pourable consistency. The amount of time will vary based on the
equipment you're using. Cool to room temperature before storing in
a clean, dry bottle or jar with a tight-fitting lid. This will keep
in the refrigerator a few months. Makes 1 cup.
</P>
<P>

1 tablespoon fresh lime juice &QL; 
1 cup sugar &QL; 
1} cups sour cream &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Mango Jiffy Jam
</P>
<P>
   From Houston Chronicle files.
</P>
<P>
   3 cups diced ripe mango &QL; 
5 cups sugar &QL; 
2 tablespoons lime juice &QL; 
1 package powdered pectin &QL; 
1 cup water &QL;

NEGOTIATORS TRYING TO AVERT STRIKE BY AIR CANADA'S FLIGHT
ATTENDANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Note deadline is 12:01 a.m. ET) (DW) 
 By TIMOTHY PRITCHARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The possibility of air travel chaos in Canada loomed
closer Wednesday as negotiators sought to avert a strike threatened
for early Thursday by flight attendants of Air Canada, the nation's
largest airline.
</P>
<P>
   Contract negotiations with the union representing the airline's
5,100 flight attendants were continuing into Wednesday night,
facing the union's 12:01 a.m. deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation industry analysts said they thought Air Canada
would seek to avoid a strike because the airline is barely
profitable and needs to keep flying in its peak season.
</P>
<P>
   But the company still made preparations for a strike, disrupting
the travel plans of thousands of Canadians and foreign visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The airline canceled all ticket sales and freight shipment
orders for the next seven days, promising to resume if the strike
was called off. Many passengers who already had tickets were being
allowed to reschedule or were being shifted to flights on other
airlines, including Air Canada's regional affiliates and its
code-sharing partners in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   But most other airlines are already heavily booked, including
Canadian Airlines International Ltd., the country's second-largest
carrier. Canadian Airlines was planning to add flights on the
important Toronto-Ottawa-Montreal and Toronto-Vancouver routes,
although not into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Air Canada accounts for almost 60 percent of flights within
Canada and a third of air travel by Canadians to the United States
and Europe. It carries 60,000 passengers a day on 675 flights with
a work force of 23,000.
</P>
<P>
   The flight attendants' dispute is the latest in a number of
labor problems at Air Canada. A two-week strike by its 2,100 pilots
last September, and a subsequent seat sale to revive business,
largely explains its $10.9 million loss in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Transport Minister David Collenette said the government
would not intervene to force the flight attendants back to work
because Air Canada is now a private company. The federal government
created the airline and owned it until a privatization program
began in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The flight attendants, members of the Canadian Union of Public
Employees, have been seeking improved pensions and working
conditions.

REPORT CITES MOUNTING CONGESTION AT BORDER CROSSINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ Stepped-up searches for drugs and undocumented
immigrants have resulted in congested highways and bridges on the
U.S.-Mexico border, a federal study said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The push to control the 2,000-mile border is challenged by
commercial trade, which has doubled between the two countries since
the North American Free Trade Agreement went into effect in 1994,
according to the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm
of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's report, ``Issues and Challenges Confronting Mexico
and the United States,'' said more than 4 million trucks and 85
million passenger vehicles entered the United States over the
Southwest border in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Processing the high volume of commercial and passenger traffic
while at the same time interdicting contraband and illegal
immigrants has contributed to congestion and air pollution,''
Benjamin Nelson, GAO director of international relations and trade,
contends in the report, which is to be submitted to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Searching vehicles ``has placed pressure on the infrastructure
of local communities along the border,'' Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   As much as 60 percent of the cocaine and 29 percent of the
heroin sold in the United States last year were smuggled across the
border, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   In border cities such as Laredo, a city of more than 160,000
people, it is not unusual for cars to wait more than an hour and
commercial trucks much more as they enter from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Vale, chairman of the Border Trade Alliance, said free trade
would never reach its potential if action is not taken to ease
congestion at border ports of entry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goals of NAFTA will not be realized if you cannot transfer
goods from buyer to seller in a safe, efficient manner,'' Vale said
from his office in Rio Grande City.
</P>
<P>
   He would like to see more border inspection personnel on duty as
well as a better use of X-ray machines for trucks, drug-sniffing
dogs, computers and other devices.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Customs Service, which works with the Immigration and
Naturalization Service to guard border crossings, declined to
comment on the GAO report until it could be reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Laredo City Councilman Louis Bruni said that while searches have
backed up traffic, he stands behind the efforts of the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is extremely congested bridges, but we do need to
address this drug problem,'' Bruni said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of tractor-trailer rigs passing through Laredo, the
busiest commercial crossing point on the U.S.-Mexico border, almost
tripled to 1.3 million in 1998 from 1995's count, Customs reported.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, South Texas leads the nation in cocaine
seizures at international ports of entry, according to a recent
Customs report.
</P>
<P>
   Since the introduction of NAFTA, Customs has taken limited
strides to expedite border crossings, including the use of giant
X-ray machines which can examine the entire contents of trucks
without unloading a single pallet.
</P>
<P>
   GAO investigators traveled the length of the 2,000-mile border
and visited with U.S. and Mexican officials to evaluate challenges
posed by drugs, illegal immigration, cross-border traffic, health
and the environment.

ALZHEIMER MONITORING SYSTEM UNVEILED 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds, see also SCI-ALZHEIMER-VACCINE-NYT)  
(gm) 
 By STEPHEN G. REED   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ More than five years ago, Harry Kuiack's mother
spent time in three facilities for people with Alzheimer's disease.
Kuiack describes them as noisy, confusing places, and they left the
family feeling guilty for putting her there.
</P>
<P>
   So when Kuiack talks about Vigil, a computerized monitoring
system that's meant to protect the privacy of Alzheimer's patients
while keeping track of their movements, he speaks partly from
experience. The Vigil system helps residents retain their dignity,
yet alerts caregivers when they stray from their rooms or get out
of bed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It does not use cameras, bracelets or any other devices for
residents to wear, and doesn't require any form of restraint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tagging is for cattle, sheep and clothing. It's not for human
beings,'' Kuiack said.
</P>
<P>
   The system, which Kuiack helps market in North America, has been
installed at Heritage House in Sarasota, a new Alzheimer's care
facility on the former site of Doctors Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the 150-bed Heritage House are still being renovated,
but this week it was given the green light to open by government
licensing authorities. It will be the first facility in the United
States to use Vigil.
</P>
<P>
   The system uses a network of motion sensors, computers and
pagers to alert nursing staff to the movements of patients in their
rooms. When patients are out of bed for more than an allotted
amount of time, for example, a staff member is automatically paged.
</P>
<P>
   Vigil can tell when residents go into their bathrooms and
whether they've come out. It can tell when someone has wet the bed.
It can tell if a patient leaves the room _ or if someone enters a
patient's room.
</P>
<P>
   Vigil's developers say the system doesn't violate privacy _ in
fact, it actually helps preserve it. Staff members no longer have
to routinely knock on doors or keep cameras on residents to monitor
movements.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that a resident can be in their room behind a closed
door and still be watched is the true advantage,'' said Dr. Bruce
Robinson, a professor of medicine at the University of South
Florida, which occupies classroom and research space at Heritage
House. ``We'd pretty much given up on that in long-term care.''
</P>
<P>
   Vigil was the brainchild of a nurse in Australia, Tricia
Shields, who asked an Australian computer firm to develop such a
monitoring system. That company, Questek, eventually installed
several of the systems in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Vigil came to North America when a Canadian nurse manager toured
Australian dementia facilities. It has since been installed in one
facility in British Columbia, and has now come to Florida.

THREE BIG MARKET AVERAGES PUSH TO RECORD CLOSINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The three most popular stock-market averages pushed
to record closings Wednesday despite upward pressure on interest
rates and general disregard for shares of smaller companies, which
fell.
</P>
<P>
   The mixed performance was regarded optimistically by some
analysts, while others contended that competition from the bond
market would prove a drag on stocks in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given what we had,'' said Larry Wachtel, market analyst at
Prudential Securities, referring to a 700-point rise in the Dow
Jones industrial average from June 24 through Tuesday morning, ``I
think the action is very good.'' He added, ``I think it's a sign of
underlying strength.''
</P>
<P>
   But Steven Goldman, a strategist at Weeden &AMP; Co., fretted about
the persistence of rate pressure as the government auctioned $7
billion of inflation-indexed notes, and corporate issuers readied
other big deals. ``It's hard to be a pounding-the-table bull
here,'' he said, predicting that rates were likely to offset the
cheerful reading expected when the corporate earnings season
reaches full stride next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone talks about how they are going to be terrific,''
Goldman added, ``but that doesn't mean stock prices will do well.''
</P>
<P>
   A few companies, in fact, warned Wednesday of lower profits, and
their shares plunged. Waste Management dropped 19 5/8 to 33 15/16
after trading at a 52-week low of 31 1/16, barely half its May 4
peak of 60. New Era of Networks slid 24 5/8 to 19 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, after Yahoo, a technology bellwether, closed
down 8 1/16 to 167 1/16, the company announced second-quarter
results that beat expectations.
</P>
<P>
   On the strength of a late comeback, the Dow Jones industrial
average advanced 52.24 points, or 47/100ths of 1 percent, to a
record 11,187.36, surpassing Friday's peak. General Electric, which
won a huge jet engine order from Boeing, was the biggest factor,
jumping 4 to 117 15/16. Caterpillar, up 2 13/16 to 62 1/8, and
Allied Signal, up 2 1/8 to 63 7/8, placed second and third.
</P>
<P>
   American Express, down 2 1/2 to 135 3/4, and Alcoa, down 2 3/8
to 61 3/8 after matching but not surpassing profit forecasts, were
the Dow's biggest losers.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500's 7.74-point rise to its record
1395.86 was paced by Microsoft, which climbed 2 3/4 to 92 5/16. A
total of 268 index issues advanced while 203 declined and 29 were
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   The NASDAQ market, which is dominated by high-tech stocks,
gained a modest 23/100ths of 1 percent in rising 6.26 points to its
new high of 2743.04.
</P>
<P>
   But record levels for the three main gauges masked softness
elsewhere. For example, declines outnumbered advancing issues on
the New York Stock Exchange by 1,691 to 1,307, and the Russell 2000
and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 600 each fell by nearly 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Drug, oil, retail and battered gold stocks turned in mixed
performances Wednesday while airlines were mostly higher. Delta
gained 1 15/16 to 62 1/16, AMR 1 5/16 to 72 3/4 and U.S. Airways
7/8 to 46 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   Volume on the Big Board expanded to a still-moderate 776.8
million shares, with 93 issues making new 52-week highs and 55 new
lows.
</P>
<P>
   Major markets in the Far East and Europe eased by about one-half
of 1 percent while prices climbed in Brazil and Mexico by
six-tenths of 1 percent and two-tenths of 1 percent, respectively.

HILLARY CLINTON STARTS N.Y. CAMPAIGN BY TACKLING CARPETBAGGER
ISSUE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINDARS CORNER, N.Y. _ Commencing her historic Senate campaign,
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton moved to dampen concerns about
her carpetbagging to New York by saying what she stood for was more
important than where she was from.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton began the day at the farm of retiring Democratic Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who told the army of reporters gathered at
his bucolic country home that he hoped the first lady ``would go
all the way. I mean to go all the way with her.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady took a major step toward a precedent-setting
Senate bid Tuesday when she notified the Federal Election
Commission that she was exploring the idea of running for office.
The first White House spouse to seek elective office can now raise
money as a Senate candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Billed as a ``listening tour,'' the trip through the largely
rural, Republican territory was clearly an effort by Clinton, a
Democrat, to bolster support in a region where her out-of-state
status may hurt her.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton quickly moved to address the carpetbagger issue, which
has been repeatedly raised by her likely GOP opponent, New York
City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a fair question, and I fully understand people
raising it,'' said Clinton, an Illinois native who has spent much
of her adult life in Arkansas. ``I think I have some real work to
do to go out and listen and learn from people of New York and
demonstrate that what I am for is maybe as important, if not more
important, than where I am from.''
</P>
<P>
   At her first extended news conference since the idea of her
candidacy was floated, the first lady calmly fielded a host of
questions, ranging from her views on legislation signed by her
husband to her roles in various scandals that have engulfed the
Clinton White House.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady dismissed worries that scandals, such as the
unusual profit she once made in cattle futures, would dog her
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've moved beyond that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady dodged a question about whether her popularity
stemmed from voters' sympathy with her for President Clinton's
affair with a White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   She responded: ``I look forward to meeting with New Yorkers. I
think they will have a lot to tell me.'' And she suggested that
despite her out-of-state status she believed that New Yorkers might
admire her stepping into what will clearly be a challenging
situation.
</P>
<P>
   When one New York City television personality questioned whether
it took a lot of ``chutzpah'' to run for office in the state,
Clinton said: ``I'm told that characteristic is not all bad in
certain parts of New York. I may need a little of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said she did not believe that her role as first
lady would conflict with a Senate race and likened her situation to
a sitting House member or governor running for another office.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady said she would emphasize education, health care,
and economic equity around the state.
</P>
<P>
   Education was the first topic at a listening session held at the
nearby state university in Oneota, where she hosted a panel
discussion on such issues as low teacher pay, the need to provide
Internet access in the schools, and the need for more vocational
education.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans to ``listen'' through Saturday, visiting
Cooperstown, Utica, Syracuse and Albany. These are largely
Republican areas where Democrats must at least make a respectable
showing to win statewide races.
</P>
<P>
   A Quinnipiac College poll last week put Clinton and Giuliani in
a statistical tie, with Clinton at 46 percent and the New York
mayor at 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Quinnipiac poll and others show Clinton beating Giuliani in
his home turf of New York City but losing upstate and in the
suburbs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The first lady's visit in a region largely ignored by national
political figures was clearly a big deal here, even for a visiting
family from Galveston, Texas, who happened to be at a rest stop on
the interstate.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady also happened to take a bathroom break at the
same rest stop as Melinda Filidei and her two young daughters,
Harleigh and Heather McGlinchey.
</P>
<P>
   When Filidei was informed that the first lady was nearby, she
exclaimed: ``Oh my God, no way. That's the first lady who was in
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, the first lady greeted the two girls and told them,
``You've got an H name, and I have an H name.''

NORTH KOREA'S PRESIDENT AS POPULAR AS EVER _ FIVE YEARS AFTER
DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Flowers are said to be blossoming out of season in North
Korea as nature joins with the Korean people in expressing
admiration for President Kim Il Sung on the fifth anniversary of
his death.
</P>
<P>
   That is the word from North Korean newspapers and radio
broadcasts, which have been going all out to hail the anniversary
of Kim's death on Thursday. The newspapers are using the occasion
to help pass the mantle of authority to his son and successor, Kim
Jong Il.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is Kim Jong Il, identical with Kim Il Sung, who filled an
aching void in the hearts of the people left by the demise of the
president,'' according to an epic poem published in North Korea's
leading newspaper, Rodong Sinmun. ``He is the dear father who
offered the same love and affection to the people in the five years
as the president did.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his death, Kim Il Sung was renamed president last year;
given the circumstances, it is not entirely correct to refer to him
as ``president for life,'' so North Korea calls him ``president''
or ``eternal president.'' Kim, who founded modern North Korea in
the aftermath of World War II, remains the center of a huge
personality cult and his body is preserved in a huge mausoleum.
</P>
<P>
   Growing numbers are visiting the mausoleum to commemorate the
anniversary, the official Korean Central News Agency reported on
Wednesday. ``The visitors pay their deepest respects to the
president and harden their determinations to remain loyal to Kim
Jong Il, true to the behests of the president,'' the agency
declared in its slightly eccentric English.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's newspapers have also found some space to denounce
``the Japanese government's attempt to imbue its people with
militarism'' and to scold ``the U.S. warmongers'' for ``impudent
interference and blackmail'' for urging North Korea not to test a
ballistic missile.
</P>
<P>
   Yet most pages in North Korea's newspapers have been taken up
with special essays and features and photos about Kim Il Sung, and
publishers have also marked the anniversary of his death by putting
out volumes 12 and 13 of the collection ``Undying Revolutionary
Feats of the Great Leader Comrade Kim Il Sung.'' In addition, the
government just published Volume 26 of Kim's complete works.
</P>
<P>
   The flowers that have blossomed out of season are said to
include white rhododendrons on Mount Paektu, a sacred Korean
mountain, and a pear tree growing beside a structure called Kim Il
Sung's ``Tower of Immortality.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to show that people all over the world are full of
praise for Kim Il Sung and his son, North Korea's press has carried
reports of foreigners chiming in.
</P>
<P>
   The national vice chairman of the Militant Action Party for
Sovereignty of Madagascar recently issued a statement for the fifth
anniversary of Kim's death, the Korean news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   The statement praised Kim Il Sung for defeating ``the U.S.-led
imperialist allied forces'' in the Korean War and concluded, ``His
history as a peerlessly great man, veteran politician and great
military strategist is now being creditably carried forward by the
leader Kim Jong Il.''

CLINTON OPENS SENATE CAMPAIGN BY VOWING NEW HEALTH-CARE FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Filed in ``a'' and ``p'' categories)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINDARS CORNERS, N.Y. _ First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton,
embarking on an unprecedented campaign to win election to the U.S.
Senate, vowed Wednesday to try again to overhaul the nation's
troubled health-care system.
</P>
<P>
   The Illinois-born first lady, who cut her political teeth in the
Arkansas gubernatorial and presidential campaigns of Bill Clinton,
used the debut of her own political career to address the
carpetbagger issue of why she was seeking election in New York
state even though she has never lived here.
</P>
<P>
   The answer to that question, she said, is that what she stood
for was more important than where she was from.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton layed out an activist agenda for government action in
areas that she has staked out during her six years as first lady _
health care and children. She promised to help retain young
teachers in classrooms, bolster public education, expand day-care
for children as young as three-years-old and reduce the numbers of
Americans living without health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton started her day with Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
D-N.Y., the retiring incumbent she hopes to succeed, at his 19th
century house on the 900-acre Moynihan farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have some real work to do, to get out and listen and
learn from the people of New York and demonstrate that what I'm for
is maybe as important _ if not more important _ than where I'm
from,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She then began a summer-long ``listening tour'' across New York
state, making her first stop at the College of Oneonta in nearby
Oneonta where she promised wide-ranging government action in a
talk-show-style exchange with New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who masterminded the Clinton administration's failed
health care overhaul in 1993, said she would like to try it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is something I'm still very committed to,'' Clinton said.
``We obviously have to rethink it, get everybody around the table,
try to figure out what will work and then come up with some
ideas,'' she said, adding: ``But we're not going in the right
direction in terms of the uninsured. I think as a country we have
to address this or as a country we're going to have to pay more and
more for less and less.''
</P>
<P>
   Her 1993-1994 blueprint was so controversial that it didn't even
get to the floor of the House or Senate even though Democrats were
in control of Congress. The administration's defeat on this
centerpiece program contributed to the GOP takeover of both house
of Congress in 1994 for the first time in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, the first first lady to ever seek elected office, said
the president had telephoned his support during his visit to an
Indian reservation in Pine Ridge, S.D.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of my husband's great contributions is how he
keeps on going,'' Clinton later said, her only elliptical reference
of the day to the year-long sex and cover-up scandal that imperiled
his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   She conceded that being on her own in a political campaign was a
bit new.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's new to me is being on this side of the microphone and
talking for myself and talking on behalf of what I believe,'' she
said as she prepared to leave Moynihan's farm for her first
face-to-face encounter with New York voters since establishing a
Senate campaign fund raising committee with the Federal Election
Commission on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no illusions that it will not be a very difficult and
challenging race, but that's what should happen in a democracy,''
Mrs. Clinton said.

<P>
   Two Republicans are jockeying to challenge her _ New York Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani and Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the college building where Clinton discussed educational
concerns for almost two hours, demonstrators held rival placards. A
woman held a sign that read, ``Hillary _ please keep your morals,
politics, and husband out of our neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Right next to her stood another woman with a sign that said:
``Upstate loves Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, dressed in a navy blue pants suit with a light blue
shirt, exhibited flashes of warmth and humor during the day. She
chatted amiably with Elizabeth Scheinman, 5, a resident of Las
Vegas, Nev., who presented Clinton with a half dozen day lilies
that she had picked near Moynihan's farm with her aunt, Irene
Gallaer.
</P>
<P>
   Gallaer shook hands with the first lady and declared: ``The next
senator from New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Beth Kutler, 32, an alumna of nearby Hartwick college who is now
a nurse practitioner, later met Clinton outside a Soccer Hall of
Fame located in Oneonta where the first lady watched six women play
keep away with a soccer ball. Clinton ``seems like a down-to-earth
person'' who ``made us feel comfortable _ like a soccer mom,''
Kutler said.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton's microphone failed at the outset of the talk
show-style event in Oneonta, she asked for an aide to fix it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe someone could come turn me on,'' Clinton quipped to the
delighted laughter of her audience.

<P>
   Clinton repeatedly underscored her status as merely a possible
candidate visiting New York to ``explore'' a possible campaign for
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Yet she readily voiced sentiments that would be expected of a
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   She replied to a question about ``chutzpah,'' saying: ``I'm told
that characteristic is not all bad in certain parts of New York. I
may need a little of that, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   She vowed as well that if elected, she would ``insure that New
York gets its fair share from Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan, the maverick Democrat elected to the Senate in a
three-way race against two Republicans in 1976, referred to Mrs.
Clinton as ``the candidate,'' adding that he would ``go all the
way'' with Clinton in her Senate bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's going to win; I think it's going to be wonderful
for New York. We'll be proud of our senator and the nation will
notice,'' Moynihan said.

CLINTON OPENS SENATE CAMPAIGN BY VOWING NEW HEALTH-CARE FIGHT

<P>
   PINDARS CORNERS, N.Y. _ First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton,
embarking on an unprecedented campaign to win election to the U.S.
Senate, vowed Wednesday to try again to overhaul the nation's
troubled health-care system.
</P>
<P>
   The Illinois-born first lady, who cut her political teeth in the
Arkansas gubernatorial and presidential campaigns of Bill Clinton,
used the debut of her own political career to address the
carpetbagger issue of why she was seeking election in New York
state even though she has never lived here.
</P>
<P>
   The answer to that question, she said, is that what she stood
for was more important than where she was from.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton layed out an activist agenda for government action in
areas that she has staked out during her six years as first lady _
health care and children. She promised to help retain young
teachers in classrooms, bolster public education, expand day-care
for children as young as three-years-old and reduce the numbers of
Americans living without health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton started her day with Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
D-N.Y., the retiring incumbent she hopes to succeed, at his 19th
century house on the 900-acre Moynihan farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have some real work to do, to get out and listen and
learn from the people of New York and demonstrate that what I'm for
is maybe as important _ if not more important _ than where I'm
from,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She then began a summer-long ``listening tour'' across New York
state, making her first stop at the College of Oneonta in nearby
Oneonta where she promised wide-ranging government action in a
talk-show-style exchange with New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who masterminded the Clinton administration's failed
health care overhaul in 1993, said she would like to try it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is something I'm still very committed to,'' Clinton said.
``We obviously have to rethink it, get everybody around the table,
try to figure out what will work and then come up with some
ideas,'' she said, adding: ``But we're not going in the right
direction in terms of the uninsured. I think as a country we have
to address this or as a country we're going to have to pay more and
more for less and less.''
</P>
<P>
   Her 1993-1994 blueprint was so controversial that it didn't even
get to the floor of the House or Senate even though Democrats were
in control of Congress. The administration's defeat on this
centerpiece program contributed to the GOP takeover of both house
of Congress in 1994 for the first time in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, the first first lady to ever seek elected office, said
the president had telephoned his support during his visit to an
Indian reservation in Pine Ridge, S.D.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of my husband's great contributions is how he
keeps on going,'' Clinton later said, her only elliptical reference
of the day to the year-long sex and cover-up scandal that imperiled
his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   She conceded that being on her own in a political campaign was a
bit new.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's new to me is being on this side of the microphone and
talking for myself and talking on behalf of what I believe,'' she
said as she prepared to leave Moynihan's farm for her first
face-to-face encounter with New York voters since establishing a
Senate campaign fund raising committee with the Federal Election
Commission on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no illusions that it will not be a very difficult and
challenging race, but that's what should happen in a democracy,''
Mrs. Clinton said.

<P>
   Two Republicans are jockeying to challenge her _ New York Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani and Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the college building where Clinton discussed educational
concerns for almost two hours, demonstrators held rival placards. A
woman held a sign that read, ``Hillary _ please keep your morals,
politics, and husband out of our neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Right next to her stood another woman with a sign that said:
``Upstate loves Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, dressed in a navy blue pants suit with a light blue
shirt, exhibited flashes of warmth and humor during the day. She
chatted amiably with Elizabeth Scheinman, 5, a resident of Las
Vegas, Nev., who presented Clinton with a half dozen day lilies
that she had picked near Moynihan's farm with her aunt, Irene
Gallaer.
</P>
<P>
   Gallaer shook hands with the first lady and declared: ``The next
senator from New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Beth Kutler, 32, an alumna of nearby Hartwick college who is now
a nurse practitioner, later met Clinton outside a Soccer Hall of
Fame located in Oneonta where the first lady watched six women play
keep away with a soccer ball. Clinton ``seems like a down-to-earth
person'' who ``made us feel comfortable _ like a soccer mom,''
Kutler said.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton's microphone failed at the outset of the talk
show-style event in Oneonta, she asked for an aide to fix it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe someone could come turn me on,'' Clinton quipped to the
delighted laughter of her audience.

<P>
   Clinton repeatedly underscored her status as merely a possible
candidate visiting New York to ``explore'' a possible campaign for
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Yet she readily voiced sentiments that would be expected of a
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   She replied to a question about ``chutzpah,'' saying: ``I'm told
that characteristic is not all bad in certain parts of New York. I
may need a little of that, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   She vowed as well that if elected, she would ``insure that New
York gets its fair share from Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan, the maverick Democrat elected to the Senate in a
three-way race against two Republicans in 1976, referred to Mrs.
Clinton as ``the candidate,'' adding that he would ``go all the
way'' with Clinton in her Senate bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's going to win; I think it's going to be wonderful
for New York. We'll be proud of our senator and the nation will
notice,'' Moynihan said.

RUSSIA NAMES NATO AIDE IT HOPES WILL PASS MUSTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Russia has nominated a new military liaison to NATO
and will expand its staff at the alliance's headquarters in
Belgium, patching up problems that arose earlier this year when
NATO rejected an appointee because it believed he was a Russian
spy.
</P>
<P>
   The new Russian official, identified only as a lieutenant
general, now must be approved by the North Atlantic Council in
Brussels before taking his position at the allied military
headquarters in Mons, Belgium, a NATO official said Wednesday,
speaking on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see this nomination as a very positive development because
it reestablishes the relationship between NATO and Russia,'' said
the NATO official.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian officer will operate as a liaison between NATO
officials and Russian troops in Bosnia and in Kosovo, where 2,850
troops will be spread around the province, supported by 750
personnel at the Pristina airport. The troops will be integrated
into the Kosovo peacekeeping force, and as in the Bosnian mission,
will have the right to refuse certain orders if ``they contradict
their national policy,'' said Pentagon spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Russia nominated Major General Roman Alexsandrovich
Yepifinov as the liaison, but he was rejected because NATO
officials believed he was a high-ranking spy. The Globe's account
of the incident in Saturday's editions incorrectly identified the
officer as then-Lieutenant General Victor Zavarzin, based on
erroneous information given by NATO officials.
</P>
<P>
   Zavarzin, accompanied by Yepifinov, led 200 Russian troops into
Kosovo to take over the Pristina airport last month. Zavarzin had
been the top Russian official at NATO's political headquarters in
Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   When Yepifinov was rejected by the North Atlantic Council in
February, Russia pulled its then-liaison, Lieutenant General
Anatoly Krivolapov, and his staff from the Mons office in protest,
nearly a month before NATO strikes began March 24.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Russia will put a total of 16 officials at three NATO
military offices, including the Mons headquarters, Bacon said. The
Russians previously had fewer than a half-dozen officials in Mons.

IMPRISONED RUSSIAN JOURNALIST WRITES SURVIVAL TIPS FOR FUTURE
`COOKIES'  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Japan)   By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The Russian authorities may have thought they would
silence Grigory Pasko when they threw him into prison after he
documented the navy's nasty practice of dumping nuclear waste at
sea.
</P>
<P>
   But the crusading journalist has refused to go quietly. From
behind the walls of a Vladivostok jail, the captain has resorted to
a time-honored Russian practice: chronicling the dismal life inside
the country's overcrowded and disease-infested prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Alexander Solzhenitsyn and other Russian writers who
often waited decades before their accounts of Soviet gulags became
known to the world, Pasko's jailhouse diary can be found on one of
the country's most frequented Internet sites on political news,
http://www.polit.ru/index-dossier/mayday/.
</P>
<P>
   The texts are not only a window into the arbitrary world of
Russian justice, but also into the mind of a man battling to
maintain emotional equilibrium.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a journalist, so he always tries to write about topics
that interest him,'' his wife, Galina Morozova, said in a telephone
interview from Vladivostok. ``And he spends a lot of time
absolutely alone in solitary confinement. The best way to get rid
of the solitude is to make some use of your talent and write about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   A career navy officer and military journalist, Pasko, 37, made a
name for himself as an environmental crusader at Boyevaya Vakhta
(Battle Watch), the newspaper of Russia's Pacific Fleet. What
really worried the authorities was the freelance work he did for
NHK, Japan's largest television network.
</P>
<P>
   After NHK broadcast a report on Russia's dumping of nuclear
waste, the authorities began to clamp down. Captain Pasko was
arrested in November 1997 and charged with selling the nation's
secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International has designated him a ``prisoner of
conscience,'' and other human rights groups have taken up his
cause. A verdict in Pasko's long-running trial, at which the
prosecutor is demanding a 12-year prison term, is expected this
month.
</P>
<P>
   When he was hauled into the military courtroom in January, Pasko
shouted out, ``We will fight!'' But there is little bravado in his
prison essays.
</P>
<P>
   The first is titled ``Cookie,'' slang for a first-time prisoner.
It is a set of survival tips for new prisoners and an informal
dissertation on the sociology of Russia's jails.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody determined to challenge Russia's authorities, Pasko
writes, should keep a large bag at home full of provisions, because
he can be hauled off to jail at a moment's notice. Essential goods
include an electric heater for boiling water, cans of food to
compensate for the meager prison rations and a blanket.
</P>
<P>
   He warns that initial prolonged detention at a police station
means threats and beatings, advising new prisoners to adopt the old
adage of Soviet spy movies: say nothing and wait to be passed on to
the next step in the chain of custody.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to survive the first 72 hours,'' he writes. ``It's
the period when they can keep you there. To extend it they need to
obtain special documents and they will have to provide you with a
defense attorney.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends in the police are no help, merely a hindrance once they
sense that the state wants a conviction, he warns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sorry for those who have friends in the militia,'' Pasko
wrote. ``That means additional evidence against you.''
</P>
<P>
   Between interrogations, the prisoner is kept in a ``preliminary
confinement cell,'' a cage stuffed with other detainees with a rank
toilet in the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Later they are shifted to ``quarantine,'' where each is
photographed, X-rayed and subjected to painful blood tests with a
thick needle.
</P>
<P>
   Then it is on to an overcrowded prison ward where inmates sleep
in shifts as their trials drag on. While the prisons are dirty,
noisy and pungent, the hardest part is not losing hope, as savvy
prisoners forecast the long sentences likely to be handed down,
regardless of whether the inmate is innocent or guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The memories about the relatively good life you had before,
about your wife and children, put a lot of pressure on your mind,''
he said. ``Just bear in mind that from now on you have nothing and
nobody: no apartment, no family, no car, no work or rewards. You
are nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, prisoners must survive, and Pasko offers his own rules of
prison etiquette. He recommends that inmates join a ``family,'' a
small group of prisoners who try to look out for each other.
</P>
<P>
   Parcels of food from home should be shared, to ease the strains
of coexisting in such close quarters, but prisoners should be
careful about sharing clothes, he says. Nothing that is lent will
ever be returned.
</P>
<P>
   Pasko says he donated two sleeves from his sweater, which were
used to fashion a crude ``mail rope'' for transmitting notes and
small packets of tea and tobacco from cell to cell. But he drew the
line at handing over his boots and pants to prisoners who insisted
that they merely needed them for a trial appearance the next day.
</P>
<P>
   The most important rule involves communication. Because cells
are rife with informers, a prisoner should never talk about his
case. Pasko reports that he became so reticent that he even found
it difficult to talk to his own lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The Pasko case underscores one of the paradoxes of modern-day
Russia. While the collapse of the Soviet state and advent of
computer technology has made the draconian censorship of Soviet
days all but impossible, the new Russia is also a place where a
muckraking reporter can be locked up for 19 months before he is
pronounced innocent or guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Pasko has spent his recent months in solitary confinement.
Despite his messages to the world outside, he appears to have
retreated further into himself and lost his zeal for doing battle
with the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   His second prison writing _ excerpts from a book in progress
about his experience in solitary confinement _ is grim,
metaphysical and fatalistic. Recalling that he bought a copy of the
criminal code six months before he was arrested, Pasko muses that
his thoughts of jail, not his role as a journalistic gadfly, might
have led to his imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about it, and the thoughts came true,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   He then briefly dared to hope that he could influence his fate
by thinking positively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps something written by me now will come true,'' he
wrote. ``What if I put down something optimistic? No, it will turn
out to be false.''

<P>
   KARADUT, Turkey _ Hidden in a chamber deep inside a mountain in
remote southeastern Turkey, guarded by giant busts of gods and
kings carved more than 20 centuries ago, lies the tomb of an
ancient king that may contain great riches.
</P>
<P>
   The search for this tomb, which has been under way for more than
a century, may be nearing a climax. Over the decades the search has
combined pagan religion with modern science, archaeology with
psychic visions, and slow-moving Turkish bureaucrats with impatient
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not only very important, but also extremely exciting,''
said Tomm Utecht, a German geophysicist who has studied the site
and believes he may have located the burial chamber. ``This complex
has been called the eighth wonder of the world. It's totally
unique. Nowhere else did a king build such an elaborate holy
monument and tomb so high up on a mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very anxious to see what it looks like and what's in
it,'' Utecht said. ``People who know the story better than I do say
it may be comparable to the grave of Tutankhamen.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1920s, the burial chamber of the Egyptian pharaoh
Tutankhamen was found to contain spectacular artifacts. No one can
be sure what awaits in the chamber carved into Mount Nemrut, which
towers above Turkey's Kurdish region 500 miles southeast of Ankara.
But the wonders that have been found on the mountaintop suggest
that it could prove splendid.
</P>
<P>
   The Nemrut monument provides a remarkably rich picture of the
Commagene kingdom, which existed from 162 B.C. to A.D. 72, and of
King Antiochus, who raised it to its greatest heights and built the
monument.
</P>
<P>
   Among the towering artifacts on the mountaintop are two rows of
statues, each nearly 30 feet high and made of six-ton blocks, that
depict Antiochus and the gods he worshiped. Commagene was a border
kingdom between the Roman Empire and Persia, and Antiochus gave
each of his gods both Western and Eastern names, like
Zeus-Oromasdes or Apollo-Mithras.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a series of magnificent reliefs depicting
Antiochus' ancestors and scenes of his shaking hands with gods to
seal the treaty under which he believed he ruled. Behind one set of
reliefs is a long and extraordinarily revealing inscription in
which the King explains his philosophy, sets down rules for
posterity, and appeals for divine protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``After taking over my father's dominion, I announced, in the
piety of my thought, that the kingdom subject to my throne should
be the common dwelling place of all the gods,'' the Greek-language
inscription says in part. ``I have taken forethought to lay the
foundation of this sacred tomb, which is to be indestructible by
the ravages of time, in closest proximity to the heavenly throne.''
</P>
<P>
   The giant heads that lie scattered on top of Mount Nemrut,
having fallen from the statues long ago, were first discovered in
1881. Since then, they have intrigued and perplexed millions of
visitors and generations of scientists. One American archaeologist
became so fascinated by the place that she arranged to have her
ashes scattered here after her death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The full meaning and scope of the sacred monument on Nemrut's
summit is not yet fully understood,'' a Turkish researcher recently
wrote. Another wondered, ``What was the aim behind the creation of
a new religious culture with its own monumental shrines constructed
at unimaginably high costs with masses of people laboring for
decades under the most severe conditions?''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to answer such questions, a Dutch engineer and
architect, Maurice Crijns, has set up a foundation and recruited
private sponsors for a five-year, $4 million project that is to
culminate in opening the tomb. But first, Crijns said, urgent steps
must be taken to preserve exposed parts of the monument, which are
fast deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most wondrous panels on the mountaintop depicts a
life-size lion together with stars, planets and a crescent moon.
Astronomers and historians have determined that their configuration
marks the exact moment of King Antiochus' coronation, showing it to
have taken place within 10 minutes of 7:30 p.m. on what would have
been July 14, 109 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the oldest horoscope in history,'' Crijns (pronounced
krines) said as he stood before the sandstone panel on a recent
morning. ``When I first came here in 1983, it was in perfect
condition. Now look how it's crumbling. The stars are coming loose.
The lion's rump is gone and so is most of his face. In five years
there will be nothing left.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come up here and have picnics, they make fires, they
even take pieces of the monument home with them as souvenirs.
Everything is unprotected, not just from people but also from the
rain and snow and lightning. They have a treasure here, but they're
letting it disintegrate.''
</P>
<P>
   Crijns, 44, made his first trip to Nemrut when he and his wife,
Olga, were seeking to escape from grief over the death of their
son. At a travel agency in the Netherlands, a poster of one of the
giant Nemrut heads was on display, and his wife was seized by a
need to see it.
</P>
<P>
   At the site, a guide showed Olga Crijns the head and said it
depicted Apollo-Mithras. She immediately replied that it was not
Apollo-Mithras but actually King Antiochus himself. German
archaeologists later confirmed that she was correct.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of clairvoyant trances, Mrs. Crijns has become
convinced that she knew the history of the statue because she had
lived a previous life in the Commagene kingdom. She believes that
in one trance she saw the location of the long-hidden tomb. After
Utecht made his geophysical studies years later, he found that the
location of the tomb ``does not contradict'' what Mrs. Crijns told
him before he began.
</P>
<P>
   Today just three people believe they may know where King
Antiochus built his tomb: Utecht, the scientist; Crijns, the
foundation director, and Mrs. Crijns, the possible psychic. For
now, they aren't telling.
</P>
<P>
   At a ceremony attended by President Suleyman Demirel in March,
the Turkish authorities signed a protocol with Crijns'
International Nemrut Foundation. It should have enabled the
foundation's archaeological team to begin work immediately, but the
matter is tied up in obscure bureaucratic channels, and the culture
ministry has not yet issued necessary permits.
</P>
<P>
   Until it does, no progress is likely to be made toward solving
one of the ancient world's most tantalizing mysteries.

 &HT;    Cox trades AT&AMP;T stock for cable TV properties
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The latest multibillion-dollar purchase by Cox
Communications may signal a winding down of the current round of
consolidation in the cable TV industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based operator announced Wednesday it was trading
$2.8 billion in AT&AMP;T stock for cable systems in the south-central
part of the country. The systems are now owned by that
long-distance carrier.
</P>
<P>
   These systems, adding 495,000 subscribers in Louisiana,
Oklahoma, Texas and Arkansas, fill in a cluster of cable TV systems
Cox Communications has been building in this region.
</P>
<P>
   And with that south-central cluster built, Cox Communications
has probably completed an $8.2 billion buying spree begun in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cox Communications is pretty set now,'' says Spencer Grimes, a
media analyst with New York investment bank Solomon Smith Barney.
``Perhaps they need to make one more deal to get over 6 million
subscribers, but that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   The company, when its latest deals close, will have 5.5 million
subscribers. That's up sharply from the 3.8 million customers the
company had less than three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching the 6 million mark won't be easy for Cox
Communications. Cox Enterprises Inc., owner of The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, holds a controlling stake in Cox
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much left to buy,'' says Bruce Leichtman, media
analyst with Boston-based industry consultant the Yankee Group.
``Everything has been pretty much consolidated at the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, AT&AMP;T will have some 17 million subscribers, or a quarter
of the market, when its purchase of MediaOne closes later this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The long-distance carrier has spent $100 million in the past
year to become the largest cable operator, leapfrogging longtime
industry leaders such as Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   In becoming so big so fast, AT&AMP;T has become the industry
bellwether. ``If AT&AMP;T doesn't do well as a cable operator, it will
cast a pall over whole industry,'' says Grimes.
</P>
<P>
   But Grimes adds that, although AT&AMP;T has had trouble with some of
its new systems, it's too early to pass judgment on the company as
a cable operator. ``Wait another year or so,'' he says. ``Then
we'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   What triggered the latest round of industry consolidation was
the high expense of rebuilding cable TV networks to carry digital
signals.
</P>
<P>
   Digital signals, transmitted at lightning-fast speeds through
fiber-optic cable, enable all kinds of new services. Those services
include high-speed access to the Internet, telephone service,
scores of new channels and sharper screen images.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cable operators needed a critical mass of subscribers to
deliver digital services,'' says Leichtman. ``It helps in both
deploying the services and marketing them.''
</P>
<P>
   You don't, however, have to be a behemoth like AT&AMP;T. What counts
is positioning _ that is, having a high number of subscribers
clustered in several key markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're well-positioned,'' says Leichtman, ``you can still
be very successful with 5 million subscribers.''
</P>
<P>
   That, in essence, has been Cox Communications' strategy for
several years.
</P>
<P>
   The first part of the strategy was to ``monetize,'' or sell off
assets not critical to the company's core cable operations.
Wednesday's AT&AMP;T stock swap is an example of that part of its
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a holding company,'' says Cox Communications
President and Chief Executive Jim Robbins, explaining why his
company traded valuable AT&AMP;T stock. ``We're an operating company.''
Cox Communications received the AT&AMP;T stock from the sale of its
stake in Teleport Communications to the long-distance carrier last
July.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Communications has been an industry leader in rebuilding its
systems to carry digital services. It offers, for example,
telephone service and high-speed Internet access in Orange County
and San Diego in California.
</P>
<P>
   It's used the proceeds from the sale of nonstrategic assets to
expand its cable TV business and build clusters in the Southwest,
the Northeast and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Its two latest purchases have given the company a new cluster,
stretching from Arkansas through Oklahoma and Texas into Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all fits together pretty nicely,'' says Robbins.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, AT&AMP;T's plan is to sell cable properties and lower
its market share before it applies to federal regulators for
permission to acquire cable operator MediaOne Group Inc.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T is expected to face a brutal battle before the Justice
Department and Federal Communications Commission over its $60
billion purchase of MediaOne and its 5 million subscribers,
including about 550,000 in Atlanta. Some consumer groups and
competitors oppose the merger, saying AT&AMP;T will become dominant in
both the cable television and cable modem markets.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Communications closed at $38.43 3/4, up $1.87 1/2, while
AT&AMP;T rose $1.62 1/2 to $58.25.

VACCINE FOR MICE PREVENTS BRAIN ABNORMALITY ASSOCIATED WITH
ALZHEIMER'S 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists working with mice have developed a vaccine that has
proved highly effective in both preventing and reversing one of the
primary brain abnormalities associated with Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen if the compound will produce the same
effects in people. Indeed, it remains to be seen if it improves
cognition even in mice, which is difficult to measure. It is also
unknown if the abnormality is a cause of the ailment's devastation
in the brain or simply one of its symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   But the researchers' report of their work, being published
Thursday in the journal Nature, is being hailed by scientists as a
landmark achievement in the battle against Alzheimer's, the
fourth-largest cause of death in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine was developed by researchers at Elan Pharmaceuticals
of South San Francisco, a subsidiary of Elan Corp. of Dublin,
Ireland. The company's researchers worked with mice that had been
genetically altered so that they developed the plaque-like deposits
commonly found in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. These
deposits, called amyloid plaques, are believed to cause cell death
in the brain.
</P>
<P>
   When the scientists vaccinated healthy young mice, the mice grew
up without developing the plaques, the researchers said. In
diseased mice, they said, the treatment eradicated the plaques,
improved the condition of damaged neurons and reduced inflammation
in surrounding tissues as well.
</P>
<P>
   Elan officials said they would seek permission from the Food and
Drug Administration to begin safety trials in humans within the
year. They said preliminary discussions with the agency had been
encouraging. Anticipating a flood of calls about this development,
both Elan and the Alzheimer's Association have set up toll-free
telephone numbers. Elan is at (800) 894-7308; the association is at
(800) 272-3900.
</P>
<P>
   Alzheimer's, characterized by progressive dementia and
incapacitation, affects four million Americans and costs the nation
$100 billion a year, according to the Alzheimer's Association. The
longer people live, the more likely they are to develop symptoms of
Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of drugs have been approved to treat Alzheimer's
and none provide more than slight, temporary relief of symptoms.
For many patients the drugs are ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time anyone has demonstrated the ability to
either totally prevent plaque deposition, or to make the deposits
remove themselves,'' said Dr. Steven DeKosky, chairman of the
scientific and medical advisory board of the Alzheimer's
Association and head of the Alzheimer's disease research center at
the University of Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``This finding is really exciting on a couple of levels,''
DeKosky said. ``The biggest issue is the use of immunization. It's
very clever to have tried that.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time the association has expressed optimism
about any pharmaceutical development in treating or preventing the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a radical innovation, a creative approach,'' said Roger
Rosenberg, a professor of neurology at the University of Texas
Southwest Medical Center in Dallas, and past president of the
American Academy of Neurology. ``I don't remember anyone proceeding
with an immunization.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Elan scientists said they had been concerned that an
immunotherapy might prompt inflammation in the brain, giving rise
to conditions like encephalitis or multiple sclerosis, but that no
such symptoms had been observed in the mice.
</P>
<P>
   To their surprise, not only did the immune system mount
antibodies against the amyloid protein, but scavenger cells also
appeared to mop up and clear the accumulated plaque from the brains
of the diseased mice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better than anything we had hoped for,'' said Dr. Dale
Schenk, Elan's vice president of neurobiology. ``We actually think
the vaccine is stimulating the immune system to come in and take up
the plaque.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ivan M. Lieberburg, senior vice president of research at
Elan, said the company was ``moving forward to clinical trials
aggressively.''
</P>
<P>
   The Elan researchers immunized the mice with a synthetic form of
the beta-amyloid peptide, which is the predominant compound found
in the plaques in patients' brains. They linked the peptide to an
immune system adjuvant that is commonly used in mouse studies. The
adjuvant prompts the immune system to attack the amyloid plaques it
would otherwise ignore.
</P>
<P>
   The adjuvant used in the mice studies is not tolerated by
people, though the researchers said that designing one for use in
humans was not regarded as a major hurdle.
</P>
<P>
   The mice had been implanted with a mutated human gene that
prompts the overproduction of amyloid, but that mutation is only
found in a minority of actual Alzheimer's patients, those with
so-called familial Alzheimer's, rather than the more common
sporadic form.
</P>
<P>
   People with sporadic Alzheimer's do not overproduce amyloid, but
instead seem to have a problem clearing it from the body. The only
way to determine whether the vaccine is effective for them would be
through clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some scientists believe that amyloid plaques are a
symptom rather than a cause of Alzheimer's and that the primary
pathology of the disease is actually manifested in tangles, which
are twisted proteins inside the brain cells of Alzheimer's patients
that look like tangled wire.
</P>
<P>
   The mice do not develop such tangles, so there is no way of
gauging their relative significance from this experiment. Nor is it
possible to accurately assess memory loss or cognitive ability in
the mice.
</P>
<P>
   If a human form of the vaccine can be developed and proved safe,
further studies should answer these questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this can be commercially developed in humans without
untoward effects, I think we may have our first crack at treating
people,'' said Dr. Leon Thal, an Alzheimer's specialist at the V.A.
Medical Center at the University of California at San Diego. Thal
has been an adviser to Elan on other studies.
</P>
<P>
   Should the vaccine prove safe, it would be subject to at least
two phases of clinical trials with larger groups of patients before
it could be submitted to the FDA for approval, which is about a
five-year process. Tests on healthy patients whose genetic makeup
shows a strong likelihood of Alzheimer's would follow.

THE SOUL OF THE EAMES MACHINE  
(DW)

 (Repeating to delete art note; there is no photo with this story)   By JOSEPH GIOVANNINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Fifty years ago on a bluff in Pacific Palisades
overlooking the Pacific, Charles and Ray Eames assembled their
house and companion studio from prefabricated parts ordered off the
shelf. The steel structure, prominently featured in an Eames
exhibition that recently opened at the Library of Congress, was
hailed as the prototype for an industrially produced house that
could yield a humane environment at minimal cost.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the light-filled buildings stand at the side of a meadow
of rye _ quintessential machines in the garden, built to show how
industrialization could economically elevate living standards for
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   The house was heroic in its idealism and global in its
implications, but a big terra-cotta pot brimming with marguerites
at the front door hints at another story. Flowers welcome visitors
today _ as they did when the Eameses lived there. Smaller pots with
scented geraniums, lobelias, cyclamens, fuchsias and Mexican
primroses line the front of the house, where the steel sash windows
meet the gravel. The great house, built as a rigorous thesis with
an ambitious social goal, has a soul.
</P>
<P>
   The potted flowers surrounding the house were largely Ray's
domain; she was ``the esthetic conscience'' of the office of
Charles and Ray Eames, said their former associate Deborah Sussman,
the Los Angeles graphic designer. ``Ray sensed intuitively when art
was present and when it wasn't, and that sense played a huge role
in the Eames world,'' she added. ``Everybody else, including
Charles, knew she knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Charles got the lion's share of the credit for the
creative work of the office, it was Ray, working with Charles out
of a bathroom laboratory, who shaped the bewitching pretzels of
plywood _ free-form sculpture molded in compound curves _ that
would lend lilt to their Eames chair. (She died in 1988, 10 years
to the day after her husband.)
</P>
<P>
   Trained as a painter with Hans Hofmann in New York, she had
perfect pitch for color. Like nature, Ray abhorred a vacuum. Over
the years, the clean-lined house on Chautauqua Boulevard acquired
constellations of small things. A miniaturist, she gardened the
interior with spoons, combs, vases and textiles. On her patios, she
cultivated botanical humility, eschewing show-stoppers like orchids
and lilies. She liked the intense orange-red-to-hot-red geranium
flower's relationship to its green leaf. When she plucked dead
leaves, she bowed straight from the waist, looking a little like a
flower, herself. Her eye delighted in a detail like the square cut
of a petal.
</P>
<P>
   On a three-and-a-half-acre lot designed to look untamed, Ray
planted the color. Her garden was pointillistic, composed of
hundreds of dots that added up to the color fields of a painter who
preferred a small canvas. Over the years, with more and more pots,
the patios filled in. What began as a spare carpet of space at the
foot of the house and studio reached what Eames Demetrios, the
Eameses' grandson, calls an ecological ``climax community.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a collection that Tina Beebe, who worked beside Ray for
years as a graphic artist, said ``always harbored little surprises
_ fraises des bois, Oxalis oregona.'' Ms. Beebe, a colorist
associated with Moore Ruble Yudell, an architectural firm in Santa
Monica, has cultivated a garden of Ray's favorites in Malibu, in
remembrance of a woman who would appear at lunches with nosegays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray taught me to love roses _ she gave me my first Belle of
Portugal,'' Ms. Beebe said. ``Ray liked flowers with little white
faces, and singles rather than doubles. She didn't avoid a flower
like tweedia because it was hard to grow. Her garden required a lot
of work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She always traveled with scissors,'' Ms. Beebe continued.
``Ray had an understanding with her neighbor, Mrs. Bailey: any
roses over the fence were fair game.'' She distributed them during
the rest of her day.
</P>
<P>
   She was a modernist with a subversive, almost Victorian,
sensibility. ``She'd give you these tiny, tiny little things
carefully wrapped in wet cotton and wax paper,'' Ms. Sussman said.
``Always this tiny little collage that was beautiful and exquisite,
and meaningful to her and therefore to you. There would be
forget-me-nots. Who has them now? The bouquets were never rigid:
she worked them like a painter, pushing and pulling. Her
understanding was in her cells.''
</P>
<P>
   She arranged the flowers on her tables at home and in the office
in a perfect relationship. ``She had as much depth and intensity of
appreciation for that little petal, the ruffly petal of a rose, as
she did for any designed object,'' said Elaine Sewell Jones, a
fellow at the American Institute of Architecture and a close
friend. ``She loved scented flowers, and whenever we traveled, she
almost always had a bouquet of gardenias or a clutch of lemon
verbena. She often wore a Cecile Bruner rose, with that teeny, tiny
bud.''
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Neuhart, who contributed to ``Eames Design: The Work of
the Office of Charles and Ray Eames'' (Abrams, 1989) with her
husband, John Neuhart, and Ray Eames, recalled her work habits.
``The first thing Ray did after breakfast was to gather anything in
bloom, and bring the flowers down to the office in a basket, along
with lunch, and arrange them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Neuhart added: ``The really wild thing was they used to go out
to the west side of the office and picnic on a vacant lot. Charles
and Ray would spread their blanket in all these weeds and debris,
and she'd have a little thing of flowers, and she'd pull up her
dress to sun her legs, and he'd take off his shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Eames recorded the world around him through his camera.
In their film about the house, ``House: After Five Years of
Living'' (1955), flowers fill the house like oxygen. The
photographs _ there are 750,000 Eames stills at the Library of
Congress _ constitute an implicit record of Ray's ecosystem of
flowers approaching their climax state.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers infiltrated the office's projects, too. Ms. Sussman
opened a deck of the Eameses' building cards and discovered one of
Ray's nosegays pictured _ daisies with a bit of a geranium, some
violets and a little begonia _ ``insignificant little things made
art,'' Ms. Sussman said.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's nosegays found their way onto the stock certificates of
Herman Miller, the company that first produced Eames furniture.
Flowers started appearing at Eames exhibitions. ``She bought potted
Easter lilies, and spread them at the base of the panels in the old
IBM galleries on Madison Avenue in New York,'' Neuhart said. ``It
took a certain curse off a temporary exhibition; it relieved the
hard edges.''
</P>
<P>
   Bouquets found their humanistic way into their multiscreen film
``Glimpses of the U.S.A.'' (1959), shown in the Soviet Union at the
exhibition made famous by the Nixon-Khrushchev kitchen debate. ``In
the `U.S.A.' film, they didn't know how to end it,'' said their
grandson. ``Ray suggested an image of forget-me-nots, and they both
knew it was right. And by one of those cosmic flukes, the flowers
had the same name with the same meaning in Russian. So at the end
of the film, the seven images merged into one picture of a bouquet
of forget-me-nots, and everyone in Moscow choked up.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sussman noted: ``She made you see things differently by the
way she put things together. Charles would sometimes conceptualize
about whether a color should be bright or subdued, but he was
conservative about color. It was one of her contributions to their
work.''

JAPANESE LEADER'S TRIP TO CHINA COULD IMPROVE RELATIONS AND TRADE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi leaves Thursday for a major
visit to China that aims to soothe relations between the great
powers of East Asia and to improve the prospects of China's
admission into the World Trade Organization by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   No major breakthrough in relations is expected. But officials
are frantically negotiating market-opening arrangements in hopes of
helping to work out a deal for China to enter the trade
organization. That would be a major diplomatic triumph for Obuchi
and would lead to important new opportunities and risks for China's
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Zhu Rongji of China offered far-reaching trade
concessions on his trip to the United States in the spring. But the
White House did not focus on the issue until the end of Zhu's trip,
and no deal was agreed on.
</P>
<P>
   Then Washington publicized Zhu's offer, embarrassing him at home
and provoking a backlash from Chinese industries that would suffer
from foreign competition. Since then, it has been unclear whether
Beijing would be willing to sweeten its offer or even keep it on
the table.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese officials declined to go into details of the
negotiations, but suggested that China was being relatively
flexible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The negotiation is going on in Beijing,'' a spokesman for the
foreign ministry, Sadaaki Numata, said. ``There has been some
further progress in certain areas. But there are questions that
remain unresolved.''
</P>
<P>
   In his two days in China, Obuchi will meet President Jiang Zemin
and Prime Minister Zhu, as well as Li Peng, the hard-liner who is
head of the National People's Congress. Attention is expected to
focus on security issues.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Japan will raise its concerns about North Korea's
missile program and the prospect that North Korea will test a
missile soon. Japan would like China to put pressure on North Korea
to hold off on the launching. But China is not expected to agree.
In any case, it is not clear that China has much leverage over
North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Japan will also ask China to stop sending ships that intrude
into disputed waters near the Senkaku islands, which are also
claimed by China and Taiwan and which they call the Diaoyu chain.
</P>
<P>
   China, on the other hand, is most likely to voice irritation at
new Japanese-American defense guidelines that would give Japan a
greater military role _ supporting American forces _ in any
conflict in the region. China is apprehensive that the guidelines
could be applied to Taiwan and that they signal a step toward
greater Japanese military assertiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Ties between China and Japan have been increasingly strained in
the last few years, and a visit to Tokyo in November by Jiang
seemed to add to the strains. At every turn, Jiang vigorously
raised the issue of Japan's invasion of China early in the century,
and by the end of the visit both sides seemed soured on the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Obuchi visit should be used to halt the worsening in
Japan-China relations,'' the Nihon Keizai Shinbun, one of Japan's
leading newspapers, urged in an editorial on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi has been trying to soothe the ill will, and in an
interview with Chinese reporters on Tuesday he emphasized that
Tokyo valued its relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our ties with China constitute one of our most important
bilateral relationships, and must be further strengthened toward
the 21st century,'' Obuchi said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the underlying problem is a deep mutual suspicion, partly
rooted in Japanese brutality in China during World War II. Chinese
complain that Japan has never properly apologized for the war and
tries to deny its culpability. Japanese insist that they have
apologized many times and that it is time to move on.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent poll of Chinese university students, 52 percent said
they disliked Japan and 23 percent said they liked it.
</P>
<P>
   Many Japanese say they believe that China is becoming more
nationalistic, more aggressive and, ultimately, more threatening to
peace in northeastern Asia.

 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When DrKoop.com announced an $89 million deal on
Tuesday to provide its health-information services to the 17
million subscribers of America Online, investors rushed to trade
both stocks. Those who bought and sold America Online shares in the
opening minutes of trading all got close to the same price, but
those who traded DrKoop.com got prices that varied by as much as $2
a share on a $35 stock.
</P>
<P>
   The early-morning volatility illustrates not just the power of
the Internet but also the sharp differences in how stocks are
traded on the NASDAQ stock market, which is home to DrKoop.com, and
on the New York Stock Exchnge, where America Online shares are
listed. Some big traders and institutional investors say the way
NASDAQ opens trading each day has bred chaos, and they are calling
for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opening of trading on NASDAQ is a complete disaster and
has been for some time,'' said Michael Cormack, manager of equity
trading at American Century Mutual Funds in Kansas City, Mo. ``And
NASDAQ has been very noncommittal about what they will do about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure both from traders and from a raft of upstart
competitors, NASDAQ officials now say their committee of market
specialists is considering something that would have been
unthinkable a few years ago: creating a single-price opening for
NASDAQ stocks, guaranteeing that everyone who wants to trade at the
opening gets the same price.
</P>
<P>
   For investors, such a fundamental change in how the market works
could mean more consistent prices for NASDAQ stocks and the end of
an often maddening process that produces big price swings,
particularly in the opening minutes of trading. Online investors
who watch the market to determine if their orders are being
executed at the best possible price are now left to wonder if big
price swings are costing them whatever money they saved in low
commissions.
</P>
<P>
   An examination of trading early Tuesday makes clear the
concerns. The strong demand for America Online shares caused the
New York Stock Exchange to delay opening the stock for 10 minutes
while the specialist responsible for maintaining orderly trading in
America Online stock tried to match buy and sell orders to
determine the best opening price.
</P>
<P>
   When trading finally began at $119.9375, up 4 percent from the
stock's previous closing price of $115.25, roughly 1.5 million
shares changed hands in the first minute of trading, all at that
single price. And over the next several minutes, hundreds of
thousands more shares traded in a range of less than 25 cents above
or below the opening mark.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was not nearly as orderly for investors seeking to buy
or sell shares of DrKoop.com, which, like virtually all NASDAQ
stocks, started trading promptly at 9:30 a.m. Demand for DrKoop.com
shares was evident in the first trade, which came at $35.50, up 50
percent from the previous close of $23.625. But seconds later
DrKoop.com traded for as much as $1 more than the opening price
and, in the first three minutes, for as much as $1 below the
opening.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, shares of America Online, one of the largest
Internet companies, are far more liquid and less volatile than
those of DrKoop.com, which went public only last month with the
imprimatur of Dr. C. Everett Koop, a former surgeon general of the
United States. Richard Ketchum, president of the National
Association of Securities Dealers, which oversees the NASDAQ
market, said he objected to comparing a small stock like DrKoop.com
with a giant like America Online, even if both are Internet
companies. Given DrKoop.com's small size, Ketchum said, a range of
trading such as investors saw at the opening on Tuesday ``is a
pretty solid result.''
</P>
<P>
   But the general pattern is one that experienced traders say they
see every day in stocks big and small _ one that cuts into the
profits of both individual and institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   The situation on NASDAQ has been made worse by the rapid growth
of online trading. Customers of firms like Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. and
E(STAR)Trade are more likely than traditional brokerage clients to
enter orders to buy and sell shares while the market is closed,
creating a large backlog of trades waiting to be executed in the
market's opening minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Many market professionals also say the problem is an unintended
result of the federal government's investigation several years ago
of reputed collusion among NASDAQ market makers.
</P>
<P>
   One trader for a regional brokerage firm says that when he had a
big order to buy shares of a certain stock, he used to call other
trading desks before the market opened and sound out whether they
were likely to be buying or selling, and in what quantities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be like a poker game, where you'd go around the table
and everyone would talk about what they'd be bidding, so you'd be
vaguely prepared,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid discussions that might be interpreted as collusion,
many NASDAQ market makers now avoid talking to one another. Today,
NASDAQ trading rooms resemble libraries where every patron is
connected to a computer network, with the dominant sound the hum of
an air-conditioner punctuated by the staccato clicks of dozens of
computer mice.
</P>
<P>
   So many market professionals have pushed for a change, Ketchum
said, that NASD's Quality of Markets committee will consider a
proposal this summer for a single-price opening.
</P>
<P>
   The committee, which is made up of institutional investors,
market makers and representatives of individual investors, has
looked at a wide variety of trading issues, including volatility in
Internet stocks, in recent months. The idea of a single-price
opening, while far from a consensus, has been gathering momentum.
If the committee adopts the idea, it will go to the full NASDAQ
board for approval.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   NASDAQ officials, who already have their hands full forging
joint ventures with foreign markets and considering whether to
extend the trading day, say they remain reluctant to make such a
drastic move about the opening. Instead, they have proposed a more
modest change, one in technical trading rules, that they say would
smooth out the market opening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not heard that people are getting wildly different
prices off the opening, nor do we see it from a surveillance
standpoint,'' Ketchum said. ``There have been delays in the
timeliness of trades being reported when there are a large number
of trades being handled at the opening. But our surveillance shows
that those shares are trading at the right prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Ketchum added that NASDAQ's longstanding objection to a
single-price system was that trading in some stocks would be
delayed, rather than beginning promptly at 9:30. A single-price
system, he said, ``is great if it comes up with the right price
quickly, but not if it results in substantial delays when people
want to trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics and competitors say NASDAQ is reluctant to take a more
drastic step because doing so would probably cut into the profits
of many of the brokerage firms that make markets in NASDAQ stocks _
the very firms that make up the membership of NASD.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New York exchange, with its auction-like opening, has a
fundamentally better opening process than NASDAQ,'' said Douglas
Atkin, president and chief executive of Instinet, which operates an
electronic trading system that competes with both exchanges.
``Everyone benefits when supply and demand meet once and you get
one official opening price.''
</P>
<P>
   The rise of many more electronic trading systems like Instinet
and Archipelago, which is 5 percent owned by American Century, is
putting additional pressure on NASDAQ to respond to traders'
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints have been enough to persuade Bernard Madoff
Investment Securities and Knight Securities, two big trading firms,
to guarantee a single price to customers who want to trade at the
opening _ a move that might serve as a model for NASDAQ.
</P>
<P>
   The benefit of a guaranteed single opening price is that
investors essentially trade directly with each other, rather than
with a market maker who profits from the spread between the bid, or
the purchase price, and the offer, which is the seller's price.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Madoff Investment Securities, a New York broker-dealer
that makes a market in the 200 biggest NASDAQ stocks, began
offering in May to execute opening trades at the midpoint of the
best bid and offer prices being quoted by all firms making a market
in a stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers object to paying the spread on the opening, and they
have asked us why can't there be a single price on the opening like
on the New York Stock Exchange,'' said Bernard Madoff, president of
the firm. ``This is exactly the system that the specialist uses on
the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.''
</P>
<P>
   But traders at some competing firms criticize Madoff's system,
and one like it from Knight, saying that to guarantee an opening
price, those market makers simply post higher than normal quotes
before the market opens. That causes the best bid and offer prices
to rise and increases the likelihood that the guaranteeing market
maker can trade at a profit from his own inventory of stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Pasternak, chief executive of Knight's parent company,
Knight/Trimark Group, sees nothing wrong with helping customers and
making a profit at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to provide a lot of liquidity at the opening,
we're going to do it at prices that are favorable to us,''
Pasternak said. ``The money we make in the first 10 minutes of the
day is less than the money we make in any other 10 minutes of the
day.'' If customers think his firm has unfairly bid up the opening
price, he added, they ``can set limits or cancel orders.''
</P>
<P>
   While NASDAQ considers the possibility of a single-price
opening, it is taking other steps to smooth out the gyrations in
the market's opening minutes. It has already instituted rules for
opening trading in initial public offerings on their first day. And
a NASDAQ proposal awaiting approval by the Securities and Exchange
Commission would change some technical rules that govern the period
just before the opening of trading, when market makers are jostling
for position.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, a market maker with unusual demand or supply of a
stock will create in that time what is known as a ``locked''
market, when the best bid price is equal to the best offer price,
or a ``crossed'' market, when the best bid is above the best offer.
</P>
<P>
   Under current rules, market makers can create such a market
without being forced to execute a trade at the unusual price. The
pending rules would compel any trader who locks or crosses a market
in the 10 minutes before trading begins to trade at that price.
</P>
<P>
   Locked and crossed markets ``are the primary problem at the
opening,'' Ketchum said, one that should be solved by the new
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Ketchum acknowledges that if NASDAQ moves to a single-price
opening, there is some promise in computer systems that match
orders and open a stock at whatever price will allow the most
shares to trade.
</P>
<P>
   But he maintains that bigger, more widely held stocks like Intel
and Microsoft usually operate with very small price changes, making
them comparable to anything on the Big Board. And, he said, they
always start trading on time.

TOCCO PICK IRES EDUCATORS, LABOR LEADERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Education union officials reacted warily Wednesday to
the appointment of Stephen P. Tocco to be chairman of the state's
board of higher education, saying Tocco's lack of relevant
experience makes a mockery of Gov. Paul Cellucci's pledge to be the
``education governor.''
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders also said Tocco's history of butting heads with
unions and others would only lead to the same hostility that
characterized the state professors' unions relations with former
chairman James F. Carlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stephen Tocco has earned a reputation for himself as a
divisive figure with a long list of enemies. Clearly these are not
the types of characteristics someone holding a high-ranking
position in state government should possess,'' said Robert Haynes,
head of the state's AFL-CIO and a former University of
Massachusetts trustee. ``In addition to all that, he has absolutely
no history or background in education.''
</P>
<P>
   Trained as a pharmacist, Tocco -- who has never worked on
education policy -- will be Cellucci's chief policy maker for
public colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
   While other labor leaders with the state's professors unions
were less critical than Haynes, they also said they simply didn't
know Tocco as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll give him the benefit of the doubt, but if the
characteristics I hear of him are true, butting heads and being
divisive, I'm not sure we're seeing anything new,'' said Bill
Murphy, president of the Massachusetts State College Association,
which represents the professors union at the bargaining table.
``The thing that we would have looked for was someone who could
have been described as understanding of the culture of higher
education, maybe coming from it somehow. What we have found over
the months in working with Mr. Carlin is a complete lack of
understanding of the culture. It's not something to be run solely
by looking at the bottom line. ... I think someone coming from it
has an understanding of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlin, who had spent nine years on the UMass board of trustees
before becoming chairman, left the post last month after 3 1/2
years and a record of cutting tuitions and raising standards _ as
well as the hackles of the professors unions.
</P>
<P>
   Tocco has a long history with the Weld-Cellucci administration,
having been brought to the campaign by Cellucci in 1991, who first
met him when Tocco was head of Associated Builders &AMP; Contractors.
Weld appointed him as head of the state's port authority in 1993.
Tocco recently became head of ML Strategies, a prominent lobbying,
public relations, and international consulting firm. He was away on
vacation Wednesday and could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Saying he had already signed Tocco's appointment letter,
Cellucci enthused about Tocco Wednesday. His remarks suggested the
governor is more interested in an agent of change than someone who
has explicit education experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted someone ... who could aggressively drive an agenda,''
Cellucci said. ``I think we've done great things in public higher
ed, lowering tuition and fees, increasing standards. I want to see
that continue. I thought we needed a strong leader to see it
through.''
</P>
<P>
   The unpaid position puts Tocco, 52, in charge of board that sets
policy for 29 campuses that includes UMass and the state and
community colleges. The board oversees the work of the chancellor
of higher education in carrying out those policies.
</P>
<P>
   While Cellucci's comments suggest the governor wants Tocco to
move ahead with the policy agenda laid out by Carlin, labor
relations will also, by necessity, be at the top of Tocco's new
to-do list. An extension on the state college professors' contract
expired last week. Negotiations, which Carlin personally conducted,
have been essentially stalemated for several months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see what the governor's interest is in having a battle
with us,'' Murphy said. ``If Tocco proves more of the same, that's
regretful.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cellucci said he thought Tocco could get along with labor,
citing Tocco's government posts and saying, ``In every one of those
positions, he worked well with all constituencies and I expect him
to continue to work well.''
</P>
<P>
   Those unions who have worked with Tocco, however, disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   As head of the building contractors association, Tocco pushed to
roll back prevailing wage laws. As Massport chief, he was accused
of trying to strongarm South Boston into allowing a new football
stadium on port authority-owned land.
</P>
<P>
   Priscilla Lyons, though, head of the higher education division
of the MTA, which counts among its membership 10,000 faculty
members on state campuses, was more willing to give Tocco time to
show he can get along with the unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think historically, the fact that someone doesn't
have experience in education is not per se a problem. We haven't
dealt with him, so we are really waiting and seeing.'' The contract
negotiation, she said, ``is obviously going to be the point at
which we see what we think.''

PORK GOES ON DIET, REDUCTING FAT CONTENT &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By ANN CRISWELL 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle &HT;    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ In the case of new leaner pork, pigs did fly. About
2,000 prime porkers from East Yorkshire, England, were imported to
the United States in 1991 aboard a specially built Boeing 747.
</P>
<P>
   After years of selective breeding and genetic improvement, the
pigs grew leaner, longer and more muscular. They are the source of
a complete line of fresh pork, more than 30 cuts, that is leaner
and lower in calories, fat and cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   Smithfield's Lean Generation Pork is actually the result of 25
years of selective breeding and research. It is the first fresh
pork to receive HeartCheck Certification by the American Heart
Association. It is designed to please consumers who demand flavor
and tenderness as well as nutrition, and medical experts who insist
on lower fat and less cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you read the recent news that research comparing the
impact of lean red and white meat on blood cholesterol shows that a
diet including 6 ounces of lean red meat consumed five or more days
a week may actually reduce the risk of coronary heart disease. Now
there's a switch.
</P>
<P>
   The studies show that proteins from red or white meat lower bad
cholesterol (LDL) levels and raise good cholesterol (HDL) levels,
according to researchers. The study was conducted at three sites:
Chicago Center for Clinical Research, Johns Hopkins University
Lipid Clinic and the University of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Lean Generation pork is 60 percent leaner than ordinary pork and
meets the AHA guidelines of no more than 5 grams total fat, 2 grams
saturated fat and 95 milligrams cholesterol per serving. Certified
cuts also must not exceed 480 milligrams sodium per serving.
</P>
<P>
   To compare 4-ounce servings of boneless center-cut pork: Lean
Generation provides 130 calories, regular pork 160; LG 26 grams
protein, regular 25 grams; LG 3 grams fat, regular 6 grams; LG 100
milligrams sodium, regular 75 milligrams; LG 1 gram saturated fat,
regular 2 grams; LG 65 milligrams cholesterol, regular 70
milligrams.
</P>
<P>
   But the most important thing about leaner pork to consumers is
that it tastes good and cooks 10 to 15 percent faster than regular
pork, cookbook author Betty Rosbottom said. In Houston recently as
a spokeswoman for Smithfield, she shared a recipe for Southwestern
Pork Tenderloins With Cumin Mayonnaise. Because the pork cooks
quickly, it's great for light summer meals.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find many uses for the spicy mayonnaise; it's so good you
may want to eat it on crackers. The pork adds some substance to
salads, and any leftovers are delicious in second-day sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   You can grill or roast the pork tenderloins and serve them with
other spicy accompaniments, from salsa to cranberry relish.
</P>
<P>
   Smithfield offers a chart of cooking times for roasting,
broiling, grilling or steam-grilling, sauting, stir-frying, pan
broiling, braising and stewing.

CLINTON RACE ADVISER EDLEY QUITS PROJECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A ghostwritten draft of President Clinton's book on
race relations has languished for months in his to-do box. And the
chief writer, Chistopher F. Edley Jr. a Harvard University
professor, is moving on after recently quitting the project in
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Edley, one of Clinton's key advisers on matters of race and
racism, sent the president a note Wednesday telling him that he
will cooperate if Clinton needs him to help finish the book, but he
is ``going ahead with other projects in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic message,'' Edley said in a telephone interview, ``is
that the ball is in his court.''
</P>
<P>
   The book, which Clinton considers a potential cornerstone of his
legacy on race relations, had been scheduled for publication in
April. But the project has stalled amid internal wrangling among
White House aides over issues as politically incendiary as the
prospects for affirmative action in the 21st century and as
nettlesome as which passages of poetry should be used to underscore
the president's positions.
</P>
<P>
   For Edley, an ardent defender of affirmative action and advocate
for bolder action on Clinton's race initiative, the talks dissolved
into an unproductive stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to continue having policy debates with the White
House staff that could go on interminably,'' he said. ``I have
exhausted my patience with that exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a news conference last week, alluded to the internal
disputes over Edley's draft for the book, tentatively titled, ``One
America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris gave me his draft, then the staff looked at it and
talked about where it was or wasn't consistent with present
policies we are pursuing,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the policy debates, Clinton said, he was unable
to devote adequate time to the project because of the Kosovo
crisis. But he promised to complete the book, which is seen as his
final major opportunity to make a lasting statement on race
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's attempt to engage the country last year in a national
debate on issues of race in American society fell far short of the
administration's expectations. ``I want to make sure that when we
put this document out it is in the form of a book that can be
useful and have something to say, and move the conversation and the
efforts beyond where we were in the presidential initiative on
race,'' Clinton said at last week's news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, he said, is that ``I simply haven't had the
time to give it the effort that it deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   Edley was heartened by Clinton's commitment to finishing the
book, particularly after several White House aides had privately
suggested the project was dead. ``I think any delay created by his
desire to invest more personal time in the book is all to the
good,'' Edley said.
</P>
<P>
   But Edley, who took a leave from Harvard in 1993 to serve in
several positions in the White House, including special counsel to
the president and associate director of the Office of Management
and Budget, remains wary that Clinton's schedulers might aggravate
the situation by leaving him too little time to work on the
project.
</P>
<P>
   Edley's draft, developed with former White House speechwriter J.
Terry Edmonds, covers about 200 pages and a wide range of complex
social issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no shortage of staff who don't care about this as
much as the president does,'' Edley said. ``This is not something a
president can work through in his spare time or at 3 a.m. It's a
significant scheduling challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Edley said he plans to invest no more time on the book unless
Clinton asks him. In addition to his work at Harvard, Edley is
advising Vice President Al Gore in his campaign for the Democratic
presidential nomination.

SETTLEMENT CLOSES THE DOOR ON DISNEY'S DIRTY LAUNDRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Walt Disney Co. and Jeffrey Katzenberg, its former
studio chief, announced the settlement Wednesday of a rancorous
lawsuit filed by Katzenberg that had opened a curtain on the lives
of Hollywood moguls whose egos, financial bonanzas and personal
furies are usually kept veiled.
</P>
<P>
   It was an abrupt ending to a three-year legal battle that raised
questions about the leadership and succession problems at Disney
under its chairman, Michael Eisner. And it brought to a close the
glare of publicity that had both distracted and embarrassed two of
the most powerful men in the American entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   The terms of the settlement were not disclosed. In his lawsuit,
Katzenberg initially claimed that Disney owed him at least $250
million in bonuses, but he later raised the figure to $580 million.
Disney had already paid him $117 million.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment industry lawyers said that Katzenberg could
eventually earn at least $200 million, including what has already
been paid to him. And the settlement might well be far more than
that, they said. But Disney executives, as well as Katzenberg and
his lawyer, Bertram Fields, declined to discuss the financial
details.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm relieved to be able to close this chapter and put it
behind me,'' Katzenberg said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Eisner termed the settlement ``acceptable,'' and said
that ``time has come to put this matter behind us and to focus on
our new business initiatives.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement ended one of the most acrimonious Hollywood
courtroom battles in years, involving combatants who had once been
friends and who together had built the Disney empire. By all
accounts, the reputation of both moguls, as well as their
companies, suffered because of the personal attacks and financial
revelations that marked the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Fields confronted Eisner on the witness stand with
evidence that the Disney chief had once said that he hated
Katzenberg and had disparaged him as a ``little midget'' and ``the
end of my pompom.'' Disney, on the other hand, sought to damage
Katzenberg, and claimed that the live-action films made under his
reign had lost $231 million, a point Katzenberg disputed.
</P>
<P>
   Even more significant, the public wrangling underscored Eisner's
apparent inability to groom an heir. Katzenberg left Disney in 1994
after Eisner, who had undergone heart surgery, declined to name him
Disney's No. 2 to replace Frank Wells, who died in a helicopter
crash.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner, who is 57, named Michael Ovitz, the former Hollywood
agent, as Disney president in late 1995. Katzenberg filed his suit
in April 1996, and Ovitz was ousted in December, walking away with
about $100 million. He recently launched a new talent-management
company.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Ovitz earned so much money _ even though his
tenure was a debacle _ left Katzenberg seething, and intensified
his efforts against Disney. Katzenberg sued Disney in 1996, two
years after he left the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does all this say about succession at Disney?'' asked one
of Hollywood's top lawyers, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
``The fact is, Jeffrey was practically groomed from childhood to
take over and didn't get it. It's like `King Lear.'''
</P>
<P>
   The bickering had become so intense that in the end, it required
two intermediaries who were not directly involved in the dispute to
resolve it. The final agreement was shaped over the July 4 weekend
by David Geffen, Katzenberg's partner at Dreamworks SKG, the movie
studio they founded with Steven Spielberg, and by Stanley Gold, a
long-time Disney board member who is close to Eisner and a longtime
business associate of Roy Disney, the Disney board's vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Geffen and Gold met at the Geffen home in Malibu for less than
an hour on Monday, and spoke numerous times on the phone Tuesday
before reaching the agreement. Geffen declined to discuss details.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the perfect definition of a settlement,'' said Geffen.
``Both parties felt they didn't get what they wanted. Disney paid
more than it wanted and Jeffrey got less than he wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   The payment to Katzenberg is not expected to affect Disney's
earnings. And Wall Street greeted Wednesday's announcement with a
yawn: Disney closed at 28 1/16, up 1/8.
</P>
<P>
   Why Disney settled now was unclear. But several lawyers not
connected to the case speculated that Eisner was seeking to avoid
an appearance next week before the hearing. His first appearance in
May proved a public-relations disaster for the Disney chairman,
especially when he was confronted with the ``midget'' comment.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Eisner and Disney were placed in a difficult legal and
public position as a result of the lawsuit. Katzenberg argued that
Disney had failed to pay him a large bonus that was called for him
in his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bonus plan, Katzenberg was scheduled to get 2 percent
of the profits of movies and television shows created when he was
in charge _ including such megahits as ``The Lion King,'' ``Beauty
and the Beast'' and ``Aladdin,'' as well Broadway and other
theatrical spinoffs, video sales and theme parks and merchandising
using characters from these films.
</P>
<P>
   To keep Katzenberg's bonus as low as possible, Disney was almost
compelled to lowball the amount of money the company would earn.
The agreement reached on Tuesday was calculated using the 2 percent
formula, but the figure awarded to Katzenberg was a fixed sum,
lawyers familiar with the negotiations said.
</P>
<P>
   But the legal battle served as a considerable distraction at the
highest levels of Disney and Dreamworks. ``Jeffrey was so
distracted that it was drawing attention away from Dreamworks,''
said one lawyer who knows Katzenberg. Katzenberg and the top lawyer
at Dreamworks, Helene Hahn, sat sat side-by-side almost daily at
the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time top executives at Disney, such as Louis
Meisinger, the Disney counsel, and Sanford M. Litvack, senior vice
president, were deeply immersed in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good that it's behind the company,'' said Jeffrey
Logsdon, a financial analyst specializing in entertainment at
Siedler Cos. ``Wall Street hates uncertainty. And once the
financial impact is buried somewhere in income statements and
balance sheets it'll be good riddance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been an embarrassing situation to have the personal
side of corporate governance so publicly portrayed,'' Logsdon said.

 &HT;    Bush signals intent to compete hard in Iowa straw poll
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush, who has a fortune in
campaign cash, has outbid Steve Forbes, who has a personal fortune,
for a prime piece of political real estate in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   In a clear signal that he thinks the Iowa straw poll is
important and he has a lot of money to pour into it, Bush is
ponying up $43,500 for the best site outside the coliseum where the
Aug. 14 event will be held.
</P>
<P>
   The unsuccessful bids were kept secret, but people involved in
the bidding process said the Forbes campaign also wanted the prime
location but fell about $500 short of Bush's bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never dreamed it would go that high,'' said Ann Dougherty,
spokeswoman for the Iowa GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who was campaigning Wednesday in Utah, bought a
60,000-square-foot site at the door where most of the straw poll
participants will enter the Hilton Coliseum in Ames, Iowa.
Candidates can use the sites any way they choose. Dougherty said
some will offer musical entertainment as well as campaign
materials.
</P>
<P>
   David Beckwith, spokesman for the Bush campaign, said his man
will get his money's worth at the $43,500 site. The cash goes to
the Iowa Republican Party. ``The space is the prime location
outside the voting area,'' Beckwith said. ``It's like an
advertisement at the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' spokeswoman Juleanna Glover Weiss would not confirm that
her candidate wanted the space Bush rented.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very happy with the site we got. Governor Bush is going
to have to garner over 50 percent (of the votes) to justify that
kind of expenditure,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes paid $8,000 for a 44,500-square-foot site acknowledged as
second best.
</P>
<P>
   Monte Shaw, Iowa campaign chairman for Elizabeth Dole (who spent
$5,500 for a site away from the coliseum), was amazed at what Bush
was willing to spend.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a lot of money for renting a piece of grass for a
couple of hours,'' Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, Bush announced that Austinite Michael Dell will
serve as chairman of an information technology advisory council for
the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Dell will lead a panel of high-tech industry officials who will
give Bush advice on high-tech issues as well as work to bring other
industry leaders into the Bush column.
</P>
<P>
   Co-chairs selected for the panel are: James Barksdale,
co-founder of Netscape Communications Corp. and current managing
partner of The Barksdale Group; Carol Bartz, chairman and chief
executive officer of Autodesk Inc., a software firm; John Chambers,
president and chief executive officer of Cisco Inc.; Richard Egan,

<P>
   PHOENIX _ When Josie Ippolito was 7 years old, she loved to get
up at 3 a.m. to help her father make tortillas in their small
family shop in this struggling section of south-central Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was just something about it that was very exciting,''
Mrs. Ippolito recalled. ``And then at 7 o'clock, I'd come home and
be dead-beat tired and have to go to school.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 years later, Mrs. Ippolito is still getting up
early to help make tortillas, but now she is co-owner of the family
business, La Canasta Mexican Food Products, whose factory produces
about 840,000 corn and flour tortillas and tortilla chips in each
18-hour day for sale to the restaurant business nationwide. And as
she rushed around Wednesday morning preparing for a visit by
President Clinton, then ducked out to have her hair done, Mrs.
Ippolito could scarcely contain her excitement _ or her pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here,'' she said, gesturing at the 25,000-square-foot
factory around her, which the company built in 1994 with a $1.2
million loan from the Small Business Administration, a federal
agency, nearly doubling its previous space. ``We're making it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Mrs. Ippolito's business is a classic success story,
chosen by the White House to hammer home the president's message
about the benefits of government and private sector investment in
the pockets of urban and rural poverty that the booming national
economy has passed by. Mrs. Ippolito, who owns the business with
her mother and two of her sisters, is also part of a potent
emerging demographic group here: businesses owned by minorities and
women.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, the Phoenix metropolitan area has ranked third among
the top 50 cities in the nation in the growth of businesses owned
by women, rising to 94,500 this year from 42,000, according to the
National Foundation for Women Business Owners, and it ranked 15th
in the nation in the overall number of businesses owned by women.
In 1996, the last year for which figures are available, there were
9,000 businesses in Phoenix owned by Hispanic women alone,
employing 18,400 people and generating $1.6 billion in sales,
according to the foundation, a nonprofit research group based in
Silver Spring, Md.
</P>
<P>
   When La Canasta emerged as the White House's choice for
Clinton's main stop Wednesday in this fast-growing city, some local
Hispanic business leaders complained, according to a former
high-ranking local official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
They thought a tortilla factory was a cliche, the official said,
and wondered why the president did not visit one of the region's
several Hispanic-owned, high-technology start-up companies like
QuePasa.com, a booming Internet portal intended for Hispanic users.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some objection,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Ippolito made no apologies for La Canasta's low-tech
industrial processes, in which women still stretch flour tortillas
by hand before tossing them onto oven conveyers that bake them in
flavors from the classic lard-based standard to boutique versions
like spinach, tomato-basil and cilantro-jalapeno.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning the first offerings of a groaning buffet were
already spread out for Clinton, who has long had a hard time
resisting second helpings when it is Mexican day at the White House
mess.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud of the accomplishments we've made,'' Mrs.
Ippolito said, noting that 60 percent of the company's 140 workers
come from within a three-mile radius of the plant, many of them by
foot or bicycle, in a neighborhood that is part of a designated
19-square-mile ``enterprise community'' eligible for special
federal tax breaks. The workforce is about equally divided between
men and women. While the company does not disclose its annual
sales, it is clearly thriving, preparing to expand into a line of
retail tortilla products to be sold in supermarkets.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mrs. Ippolito may have begun her tortilla-making career as a
childhood lark, but she joined the business full time as a result
of a family tragedy: the death of her father, Richard (Wero) Abril,
in 1974. Her mother, Carmen Abril Lopez, was left with seven
children under the age of 24, and Mrs. Ippolito went to work in the
business, which had started as a neighborhood tamale stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a matter of survival at that point,'' Mrs.
Ippolito said. ``We all had to lock arms and go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the White House talks up its proposals of tax incentives
for new businesses in depressed areas, Mrs. Ippolito wants Clinton
to know that even existing small businesses need special help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been here 39 years,'' she said. ``It's nice to bring in
new businesses. However, you don't forget those businesses that
have a proven track record.''

 &HT;    South Africa would OK a Coke purchase of Schweppes
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola Co. will receive regulatory approval in
South Africa if it consummates a deal to buy Cadbury Schweppes'
soft-drink brands in that country.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa's Competition Board said Wednesday it ``has decided
to condone the intended merging of these two interests'' because
the companies do not really compete in that market.
</P>
<P>
   While the regulatory situation appears bright in South Africa,
Coca-Cola has faced some antitrust opposition to its proposed
purchase of Cadbury Schweppes' brands in more than 100 nations.
</P>
<P>
   That particular deal _ which excludes South Africa, the United
States and most of Europe _ is now valued at $1.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In May, it was scaled back from $1.85 billion when 20 European
nations were eliminated because of regulatory concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In South Africa, the companies have had an agreement since the
1960s, permitting Coca-Cola to bottle and distribute Schweppes
products.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has, in consequence, been no effective competition
between Coca-Cola and Schweppes products,'' the Competition Board
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market leader _ Coca-Cola _ determines prices in the
market. ... Manifestly, the competitive situation post-merger will
be identical to the current situation and accordingly there are no
grounds for blocking the intended merger.''
</P>
<P>
   The board said it could reconsider its decision if new
information emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola has a market share of about 83 percent in South
Africa, while Schweppes' share is estimated at about 15 percent.
Pepsico exited the market a few years ago after the collapse of its
bottler.
</P>
<P>
   Not a done deal
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola has not yet finalized a deal in South Africa, which
analysts said could cost about $165 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in discussions with Cadbury Schweppes and its
South African entity regarding the proposed acquisition,''
Coca-Cola spokesman Randal Donaldson said Wednesday. Cadbury owns
55 percent of its South African subsidiary, with local interests
there controlling the remainder.
</P>
<P>
   If successful in South Africa, Coca-Cola would be adding an
estimated 50 million Schweppes cases a year to its system. That
would come on top of the 470 million cases covered by Coca-Cola's
existing deal to buy those brands in 106 other countries.
</P>
<P>
   That deal has met with regulatory resistance in the key markets
of Australia and Mexico. Those two countries alone represent 140
million cases annually, or about 30 percent of the existing deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still pursuing the acquisition in both Australia and
Mexico,'' Donaldson said.
</P>
<P>
   The company expects to close that deal in most of the other
nations later this month or early next month.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, Coca-Cola closed down 62 1/2 cents at $63
Wednesday.

PUTNAM BRINGS IN INVESTING MUSCLE OF FINANCIER LEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HEATHER KAMINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Putnam Investments, in a bold move to distinguish
itself from competing mutual fund companies, said Wednesday it has
teamed up with Boston financier Thomas H. Lee to offer alternative
investments to institutional investors and wealthy individuals who
have accumulated even more wealth in the long-running bull market.
</P>
<P>
   Putnam is the nation's fourth-largest mutual fund manager with
$328 billion under management, but the Boston firm watched its net
sales drop sharply in 1998. Although Putnam said this was not the
reason for the new offering, the fund company hopes the unusual
partnership with one of the country's most successful investors
will help retain its most affluent clients and attract money from
new investors.
</P>
<P>
   And in an era when individual investors are getting into riskier
investments, analysts say Putnam may be attempting to add pizazz _
along with assets _ to an image of being a conservative fund
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Boston-based Thomas H. Lee Co., which buys companies, turns them
around, and resells them in a risky strategy that often brings
extraordinary profits for his clients, is among the country's
best-known private investment firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Times are changing and Putnam realizes they must change with
them,'' said Geoff Bobroff, a financial industry consultant in East
Greenwich, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   The Putnam-Lee agreement is believed to be among the first of
its kind in the mutual fund industry and arose in part from a
30-year business relationship between Lee and Putnam's chief
executive, Lawrence Lasser, who began talking about the unusual
arrangement a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   With the agreement, Lee and Lasser are strengthening their
firms' ties in another way: Putnam has agreed to invest an
undisclosed amount in a minority stake in Thomas H. Lee Co., Lee's
core investment business, which will now be called Thomas H. Lee
Partners.
</P>
<P>
   Putnam's goal in teaming up with Lee, said Steven Spiegel,
Putnam senior managing director, ``is to establish jointly a firm
in alternative investments and equity business that is global in
scope and the largest and best in the investment arena.''
</P>
<P>
   Putnam said its first investment offering under the agreement
would be rolled out by year's end through a newly formed investment
partnership, TH Lee, Putnam Capital. The partnership will be 25
percent owned by Putnam and 75 percent owned by Lee. Lee will lead
the new company as chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Although the specific nature of the investments in the first
fund has not yet been determined, the focus of TH Lee, Putnam
Capital will be equity investments in a range of sophisticated
vehicles from hedge funds and venture capital funds to real estate
and European companies _ with Lee's high-profile name attached to
them.
</P>
<P>
   Although this is Putnam's inaugural run in offering a way for
clients to invest in private equity deals, many asset managers are
now recognizing the need to do so.
</P>
<P>
   For example, AIA Capital Corp., the financial advisory division
of American International Group Inc., and Blackstone Group, a
private US investment bank, recently joined forces to offer a range
of restructuring, acquisition, and financing services in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   And mutual fund companies, such as Alliance Capital Management
and Wellington Management, have added hedge funds to their plate of
offerings in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The Lee-Putnam partnership provides alternative investments
``under one roof,'' Lee and Lasser said in a joint statement.
``This is one of the first major strategic alliances between a
large investment manager and a leader in private equity,'' they
said.
</P>
<P>
   The companies said they would tap Scott Sperling, managing
director of Lee, as president of TH Lee, Putnam Capital.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also has benefits for Lee, the companies said, because
it will help him widen his operation's channels for distribution
and create a more extensive line of products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have our own business in buyouts and we don't want to
dilute ourselves, but this venture offers other opportunities in
capital options,'' Lee said in a telephone interview Wednesday.

SPAIN'S LEADERS TAKE THEIR THEORIES TO SUMMER SCHOOL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN LORENZO DE EL ESCORIAL, Spain _ The Civil Guards in crisp
green uniforms snapped to attention while news photographers and
television cameramen focused on the most glamorous speakers who
were arriving for the first day of university summer school in this
former seat of royalty near Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   The health minister emerged from one dark limousine and the
secretary of state for security from another. The school director,
Dr. Alberto Portera-Sanchez, an American-trained neurologist who is
making his debut as ringmaster at what has become one of Spain's
prime summer diversions, scurried to give each a hero's welcome.
</P>
<P>
   The politicians, intellectuals and scientists here no longer
simply relax on the beach in July or August. They are asked to
speak and to be conspicuous presences at the growing number of
university summer courses across Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Much news in the peak vacation period emanates from the crowded
classrooms, which expect to attract 100,000 students this summer.
The students and the press, looking for an article while the
government and many businesses shift to idle, pore over the latest
theories by Spaniards or notable foreigners, who have included
George Bush and Oliver Stone.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very Spanish formula,'' said Jose Luis Garcia
Delgado, director of the oldest summer school, the Menendez Pelayo
International University, in Santander. ``We make room for
interlocutors who don't normally speak in an academic setting.''
</P>
<P>
   As school opened, Santander seemed to receive more national news
coverage than its larger rival, the Madrid Complutense University
summer course in El Escorial. Santander's knockout punch was
Spain's two main union leaders, who called for the creation of more
jobs. El Escorial could muster only the health minister to discuss
biomedical research and, in a separate room, the security chief
talking about Spain's thoroughly modern police methods.
</P>
<P>
   Both officials said after class that they speak at the courses
strictly to support higher education, and not to score political
points or make headlines. But the health minister's chief aide,
Cristina Garcia, said of the exposure, ``It all helps.''
</P>
<P>
   The courses used to be confined mainly to the two exclusive
locations, at Santander, in a building that was a royal palace
early in the century, and here in three historic buildings near the
enormous 16th-century monastery and palace 30 miles northwest of
Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   Now a cottage industry of summer courses has emerged. Forty of
the 66 Spanish universities offer a total of hundreds of classes,
and they all vie for the top speakers. The growth of the courses
also illustrates Spain's changing educational landscape. Since
Francisco Franco died in 1975, the number of universities has more
than doubled and the number of students has tripled, to one and a
half million, a third of Spaniards from 18 to 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``The young people asked for _ really demanded _ a university
education,'' said Portera-Sanchez.
</P>
<P>
   The students are largely university-age participants, but they
include an increasing number of graduate students and people who
seek refresher courses. Students in degree programs may apply for
credit, but it is not always automatic.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of featuring famous speakers who make headlines arose
gradually at Santander in the transition to democracy after Franco.
By the early '80s, members of the newly elected Socialist
government used the Santander forum for major announcements, and so
many political leaders were on the summer roster that Santander
became known as the ``summer parliament.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the movers and shakers are more widely scattered, but the
concept has become entrenched as even more students attend the
classes.

 &HT;    Cox Communications rises
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Cox Communications' deal to swap 50.3 million shares
of AT&AMP;T stock for 495,000 cable television subscribers was received
fairly well by investors, who sent shares of the Atlanta-based
company up 5.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Communications closed at $38.43 3/4, up $1.87 1/2, on
higher-than-average trading of 1.6 million shares. AT&AMP;T's stock
rose 2.9 percent, closing at $58.25. Cox Enterprises Inc., owner of
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, holds a controlling stake in Cox
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which values the customers at about $4,230 each, tends
to increase the value of other cable companies, said Gary Farber,
an analyst with SG Cowen.
</P>
<P>
   Cablevision Systems rose 62 1/2 cents to close at $71.
</P>
<P>
   Cable television companies are in a period of consolidation,
hoping to gather enough clustered customers to efficiently deploy
advanced telephone, cable television and Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's deal, if approved by regulators, would make
Atlanta-based Cox Communications the nation's fifth largest cable
operator. AT&AMP;T, the largest cable television company, is selling
systems to look less giant when regulators meet to discuss its
pending acquisition of MediaOne Group. Shares of MediaOne, which
serves most of metro Atlanta, rose $1.68 3/4 to $78.62 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Henderson, an analyst with Janco Partners, said the stocks
of cable companies have enjoyed an unprecedented run, climbing more
than 400 percent since early 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The real test for cable television companies will come in the
next 12 months when they begin offering the new, advanced features
to their customers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think in the face of the valuations, which are at all-time
highs, people should use a bit of caution,'' Henderson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The execution and deployment of these services is going to be
a lot more difficult than the market is assuming.''
</P>
<P>
   In the long term, Henderson said he thinks the cable television
companies will be better able to compete than their competitors,
which include phone companies.

HOUSE REPUBLICANS SEEK TO CUT TAX RATE ON CAPITAL GAINS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Del., N.J.)  (mk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans said Wednesday that they would
seek to cut the top tax rate on long-term capital gains to 15
percent from 20 percent as part of the big tax-cutting bill they
will take up next week in the face of opposition from President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   If enacted, the cut in the capital gains tax rate, which applies
to profits on the sale of stock and other assets held for more than
a year, would give a break to the growing legions of individual
investors. And it could further fuel the long bull market on Wall
Street, where stock prices hit another new high Wednesday. Rep.
Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, said the capital gains tax cut would help keep the
economy growing by stimulating additional savings and investment.
</P>
<P>
   Archer's capital gains proposal will be one element of an $864
billion, 10-year tax-cutting plan that his committee is scheduled
to vote on next week as the Republican-controlled Congress begins a
politically charged showdown with Clinton over how to allocate
trillions of dollars in projected federal budget surpluses. The
capital gains tax reduction would account for about $50 billion of
the tax cut over a decade, congressional aides said.
</P>
<P>
   The top capital gains rate was last cut, to 20 percent from 28
percent, as part of the 1997 bipartisan tax and budget deal. Last
year, Clinton signed legislation that reduced to one year from 18
months the period that stocks or other assets had to be held to
qualify for the long-term rate.
</P>
<P>
   Prospects for the further cut in capital gains are uncertain.
The administration assailed the plan Wednesday, partly on the
ground that it favors the wealthy, who own the vast majority of
stocks and bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Sen. William Roth, R-Del., chairman of the Senate
Finance Committee, is leaning against including a capital gains cut
in the tax bill that he is drafting for the Senate to consider
later this month. Roth favors other proposals to spur savings and
investment, including expanding Individual Retirement Accounts and
the 401(k) retirement savings program.
</P>
<P>
   But both Archer and Roth intend to include in their bills the
first substantial broad-based reduction in personal income taxes
since 1981. Roth appears to be settling on a plan that would
increase the amount of income that would be subject to the lowest
income tax rate of 15 percent. Archer has not divulged his
approach.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has made it clear he will veto any tax cut of the size
and shape that Archer is developing. But he has signaled his
willingness to negotiate, and many Democrats and Republicans
believe there is a good chance that the White House and Congress
will work out a deal on taxes and other budget issues this year, in
large part because the projected surpluses are so great that they
can accommodate both parties' priorities.
</P>
<P>
   While the House is bitterly divided along partisan lines over
taxes, there is considerable support among Democrats in the Senate
for a sizable tax cut this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very large numbers of Democrats and Republicans in
the Senate who want a tax cut and are prepared to meet in the
middle,'' said Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., who has co-sponsored
a bipartisan plan to cut taxes on the middle class.

   Clinton has invited congressional leaders to meet with him next
week to discuss his proposal for shoring up Medicare, the health
insurance system for the elderly and disabled, and administration
officials said they expect the session to range across the panoply
of budget issues dividing the parties.
</P>
<P>
   After some wrangling among Republicans about how large a tax cut
to pursue this year, Archer agreed at a meeting on Friday with the
speaker of the House, J. Dennis Hastert, to put a price tag of $864
billion on the House's tax-cutting package over the next decade.
The tax cuts would be phased in as the projected surpluses grow,
with $5 billion available for tax cuts next year and $200 billion
over the first five years, Archer said.
</P>
<P>
   The $864 billion figure is an increase from the $778 billion
earmarked by Republicans earlier this year for a tax cut,
reflecting new estimates showing that the budget surplus will be
larger than anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Roth is likely to limit his tax cut bill to no
more than the original $778 billion to insure that there is money
available for adding prescription drug coverage to Medicare, a goal
shared by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office reported last week that the
surplus over the next decade would be just under $2.9 trillion. Of
that amount, $1.9 trillion would come from the Social Security
system, money that both parties have agreed should go to shoring up
the retirement system and not to tax cuts or general spending.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans are battling primarily over what to do
with the other $996 billion, which represents a cumulative excess
of general tax revenues for the next 10 years if spending is kept
at current levels (a separate estimate by the White House put the
figure at just over $1 trillion).
</P>
<P>
   While Republicans want to use nearly all of the surplus for tax
cuts, the president has proposed using about $250 billion over 10
years for tax breaks to encourage low- and middle-income families
to save more for retirement. He wants to use most of the rest of
the $1 trillion to help extend Medicare's solvency and to increase
spending on education, child care, health care and the military.
</P>
<P>
   Archer said that if his capital gains tax plan were signed into
law it would apply retroactively to all sales starting July 1 of
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Under Archer's plan, the capital gains tax rate for taxpayers in
the 15 percent income tax bracket _ generally those considered low-
to middle-income _ would decline to 7.5 percent from 10 percent.

MOROCCAN RUNNER SHATTERS WORLD RECORD IN THE MILE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By FRANK LITSKY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once, the mile was the glamour race of track and field, the race
that made international heroes of Glenn Cunningham, Jim Ryun,
Sebastian Coe and Steve Ovett. The most memorable race in history
may have been Roger Bannister's breakthrough in 1954 when he became
the first to run a mile faster than four minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, the slightly shorter 1,500 meters has been
run in most major meets, and the mile has been all but swept aside.
The attraction is still there, however, and Wednesday night the
mile regained the spotlight, at least for the 3 minmutes 43.13
seconds it took Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco to shatter the world
record.
</P>
<P>
   The performance came during the Golden Gala meet in Rome's
Olympic Stadium. Although the 24-year-old El Guerrouj has lost only
twice in four years, he has not entranced the track and field
public, at least in the United States, like such runners as Michael
Johnson, Marion Jones, Haile Gebrselassie and Maurice Greene.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he will now. El Guerrouj broke the six-year-old world
record of 3:44.39 by Noureddine Morceli of Algeria, set in Rieti,
Italy. Had they run their record races head to head, El Guerrouj
would have beaten Morceli by 10 yards. Had El Guerrouj run his
record race against Bannister's historic time of 3:59.4, he would
have beaten the Englishman by 120 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The race Wednesday gave El Guerrouj's all four world records
outdoors and indoors in the mile and the 1,500 meters. He made it
clear before the race that he wanted this record and said, ``If I'm
helped by the weather conditions and by Roman fans, I can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   On a hot night, the spectators did their part, the Kenyan
pacesetters did theirs and Noah Ngeny of Kenya kept the pressure on
El Guerrouj over the last 200 meters. In paced races, the record
breakers usually finish far ahead, but Ngeny's second-place time of
3:43.40 was the second fastest ever. Rui Silva of Portugal ran
third in 3:50.91 and Andres Diaz of Spain fourth in 3:51.15, also
career bests.
</P>
<P>
   After the race, to wild cheering, El Guerrouj ran a victory lap,
waving a Moroccan flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just very, very happy,'' he said. ``I went so fast past
the clock that I didn't know at first what I had done. I needed to
bring some happiness to my family as my uncle died recently. Rome
is a magic track for me.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   El Guerrouj is 5 feet 9 1/4 inches tall and weighs 128 pounds.
His first big performance came in 1992, a third place in the 5,000
meters in the world junior championships. Since then, he has
concentrated on the mile and the 1,500 meters, which is almost 120
yards shorter than a mile.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, in the same Rome meet, he broke Morceli's
1,500-meter record by running 3:26.00. Conversion tables used by
track and field statisticians equated that time to a 3:42.5 mile.
</P>
<P>
   In a 10-day span in February 1997, over smaller tracks, he set
the existing world indoor records of 3:31.18 for 1,500 meters and
3:48.45 for the mile. He won the world 1,500-meter championship
outdoors in 1997 and indoors in 1995 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, when he won 12 of 13 races at 1,500 meters and the
mile, his only loss came in the Atlanta Olympics, where he fell
just before the start of the last lap and finished 12th. Morceli
won that race, but knew his successor was in place.
</P>
<P>
   The Rome winners Wednesday night included Jones, Greene, Michael
Johnson and Allen Johnson, all from the United States, and Wilson
Kipketer of Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who has not lost at 100, 200 or 400 meters in four years,
won the women's 200 easily in 22.18 seconds. Greene, who set a
world record a month ago of 9.79 seconds for the men's 100 meters,
won the Rome 100 in 9.85 seconds, a time only he and Donovan Bailey
of Canada have ever bettered.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Johnson, who missed the U.S. championships three week
ago with a strained quadriceps muscle, ran his first 200-meter race
in six weeks and won in 19.93 seconds. Allen Johnson beat
countrymen Mark Crear and Larry Wade in the men's 110-meter hurdles
in 13.01 seconds. Kipketer won the men's 800 meters in 1:42.49, the
fastest time in the world this year.
</P>
<P>
   But the star of the night was El Guerrouj, and he said he was
not done. After his race, he suggested he could run faster _ 1,500
meters in 3:24, the mile in 3:41 or 3:42.

TEXAS NUCLEAR PLANTS MAKE Y2K SAFETY CORRECTIONS &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By BILL DAWSON 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Texas' two nuclear power plants have finished all
corrective work on the Y2K computer glitch that directly relates to
safety, but some other fixes still need to be made, the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The NRC had set July 1 as a non-mandatory ``readiness target
date'' for nuclear plants to eliminate potential Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   Plants that did not correct all possible problems by that date
had to submit detailed schedules showing how they would complete
their remaining Y2K work.
</P>
<P>
   Utility officials assured the NRC that the work still left at
the two Texas plants will be complete before Jan. 1, 2000, when the
Y2K bug could cause some computerized systems and devices to
misread the date and malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   The two nuclear plants are the South Texas Project near Bay
City, about 90 miles southwest of Houston, and Comanche Peak near
Glen Rose, about 50 miles southwest of Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   These Texas facilities are among 27 nuclear power plants across
the country that the NRC said still have some Y2K corrections to
make before Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the remaining work affects the ability of a plant to
shut down safely, if needed,'' the NRC announced, basing that
conclusion on reports from nuclear plant operators.
</P>
<P>
   STP Nuclear Operating Co., which manages the South Texas plant
for its four owners, told the NRC it would finish remaining
Y2K-related work by Oct. 31. The owners are Houston-based Reliant
Energy, Dallas-based CSW Corp. and the cities of Austin and San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The incomplete work at the plant involves two computer
modernization projects that were begun about five years ago for
reasons unrelated to the Y2K glitch, said Mark McBurnett, the
plant's director of quality and licensing and its Y2K project
manager.
</P>
<P>
   One project involves a computer system for inventory and
procurement of parts.
</P>
<P>
   The other is an integrated computer system that will combine
information on plant processes _ things like temperature and power
levels _ in a more convenient form for operators to monitor,
McBurnett said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of TXU Electric and Gas, the Dallas-based owner of the
Comanche Peak plant, told the agency work remains on a system for
training plant operators and on a system that purifies cooling
water at one of the two power-generating units.
</P>
<P>
   Removing impurities from this enclosed cooling system maintains
it at maximum efficiency and prevents problems that might result if
impurities built up over a long period, TXU spokesman Rand LaVonn
said.
</P>
<P>
   This Y2K correction was not made by the NRC's July 1 target date
because TXU officials decided it would be less costly to combine it
with a regularly scheduled refueling operation later this year, he
said.

PAKISTAN'S MUSLIM GUERRILLAS VOW TO FIGHT ON IN KASHMIR DEFYING
PRIME MINISTER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CELIA W. DUGGER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Three days after Pakistan's prime minister
assured American diplomats that he would seek the withdrawal of
Muslim guerrillas from the Indian-held part of Kashmir, no pullback
has taken place. Pakistan's foreign minister expressed doubts about
whether the government would be able to persuade the men to leave.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of an umbrella organization that represents more than
a dozen of the militant groups that say they are fighting in
Kashmir vowed Wednesday that they would battle on ``until the last
drop of our blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Sayed Saluhuddin, head of the United Jihad Council, said at a
news conference in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, that Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif's promise to encourage their withdrawal was
``tantamount to stabbing the movement in the back.''
</P>
<P>
   Pakistani opposition political parties, fundamentalist groups
and retired army officials continued to harshly criticize a deal
that they said had undercut militants who were widely regarded in
Pakistan as heroic freedom fighters.
</P>
<P>
   In the battle zone, Indian soldiers continued fighting for
control of treacherous mountain peaks overlooking a strategic
military supply line in Kashmir. Indian officials said, as they
have every day for weeks, that it was not primarily Islamic
militants but Pakistani soldiers who have occupied Indian
territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are simply no indications of a withdrawal,'' said Col.
Bikram Singh, a spokesman for the Indian army. ``The enemy is
giving us stiff resistance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pakistani army's chief of staff, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, said
Tuesday that he was waiting for the prime minister to return to
Islamabad before making any decisions about a withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif, who has paid calls on President Clinton in Washington
and Prime Minister Tony Blair in London, is expected back in
Pakistan on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   When Sharif met with Clinton, on Sunday, the men signed an
agreement that bound Sharif to take steps to restore what American
officials called the sanctity of the cease-fire line that divides
the Pakistani- and Indian-held portions of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif has not made any public statement about the agreement,
which is already causing him serious political trouble at home. In
a brief conversation with The News, an English-language daily in
Pakistan, the prime minister said nothing about the proposed
withdrawal, but did boast that Pakistan had better missiles than
India.
</P>
<P>
   ``India knows it well that Pakistan will give a befitting reply
if a war is imposed on Pakistan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days Pakistani diplomats have said their government
will fulfill the commitment Sharif made to Clinton by trying to
persuade the men they call Kashmiri freedom fighters to pull back
from the mountains where they are dug in. The government's pitch
will be that the men can leave now because they have achieved their
objective: to put the status of Kashmir back on the international
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kashmir dispute, which has caused two wars between India
and Pakistan, predominantly Hindu India claims the Himalayan
territory as a state, while Pakistan, an Islamic nation, says the
mostly Muslim area should be allowed to decide whether to join
India or Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   For two months India and Pakistan, which became declared nuclear
powers a year ago, have been engaged in heavy fighting, shelling
each other with huge artillery guns across the so-called line of
control that separates their zones of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan has maintained that the forces in the Indian portion
are militants it does not control, while India says they are
Pakistani soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan's foreign minister, Sartaj Aziz, said Wednesday in an
interview with the BBC in London that his government would use its
influence to persuade the mujahedeen, or holy warriors, to withdraw
from the Kargil and Dras sectors of Kashmir, but he said they would
listen only if they believed that Kashmir would be given the right
to join Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Asked directly if Pakistan would succeed in getting the men to
withdraw, Aziz said, ``At the moment we are not sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Aziz's comments, Indian officials accused him of
being misleading. The fighters are Pakistani soldiers who can be
recalled with a simple order, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks Wednesday, India's prime minister, Atal Behari
Vajpayee, was adamant that Kashmir would not be the subject of
negotiations until all Pakistani forces had left Indian territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The objective is one and only one,'' Vajpayee told a
conference of state chief ministers who gathered here today to be
briefed on the Kashmir conflict. ``It is the complete and
unconditional withdrawal of the intruders from our side of the line
of control. There is no other objective and no other subject that
we are discussing.''

FLORIDA JURY RULES AGAINST TOBACCO COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Florida jury Wednesday found against the nation's biggest
tobacco companies in the first class-action case to reach a
verdict, holding that they conspired to hide the danger and
addictiveness of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   The six-member jury in a Miami state court also said that both
compensatory and punitive damages could be awarded, throwing open
the door to hundreds of thousands of potential claims by current
and former smokers in Florida that could cost the tobacco industry
billions to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's decision ended the first phase of a complex trial
that has already lasted a year. In the next phases, jurors will
review the cases of smokers and decide whether to award damages.
Claims can be filed on behalf of any Florida resident, living or
dead, who was addicted to cigarettes and suffered certain
smoking-related diseases as determined by jury decision.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier settlements by tobacco producers totaling $246 billion
to resolve lawsuits brought by state attorneys general seeking to
recover health-care costs spent treating smoking-related illnesses
did not bar claims by individual smokers or classes of them.
</P>
<P>
   The industry had initially sought such protections as the price
of settling the state lawsuits but dropped the effort when
anti-smoking groups opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   Court decisions in cases brought by individual smokers have been
mixed recently. But Wednesday's decision follows two large jury
awards against producers in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   In March, an Oregon state jury ordered Philip Morris Cos. to pay
$81 million in compensatory and punitive damage to the family of a
man who smoked Marlboro cigarettes for four decades before he died.
And in February, a California jury ordered Philip Morris to pay
$51.5 million to a woman who said her inoperable lung cancer was
caused by smoking, though the punitive damage part of that award
has since been cut in half.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for both plaintiffs and the tobacco companies involved
in the Florida case were barred by Robert Kaye, the presiding
Circuit Court judge, from commenting on Wednesday's decision. But
producers are expected to challenge the class-action proceeding as
soon as the first award against them is made.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Aronson, the president of Aronson Washington Research,
which follows tobacco litigation for institutional investors, said
that it is highly unusual for any class-action case of the
magnitude of the Florida smoking lawsuit to go to verdict because
of the magnitude of the stakes involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``With several hundreds of thousands of people lining for
claims, this could mean a lot of money,'' said Ms. Aronson. ``It
also could also block the Florida court dockets for many years to
come with smoking claims.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with Philip Morris, the defendants in the Miami case
included R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., a subsidiary of RJR Nabisco
Holdings; Lorillard Tobacco, a subsidiary of Loews; Liggett Group,
a subsidiary of Brooke Group, and Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco, a
subsidiary of BAT Industries PLC. Two now-defunct trade groups, the
Council for Tobacco Research and the Tobacco Institute, were also
defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida class-action lawsuit was filed in 1994 by Stanley
Rosenblatt, a lawyer in Miami. In 1998, Rosenblatt and and his
wife, Susan, who is also a lawyer, scored a major victory when
tobacco producers agreed to pay $300 million to settle a lawsuit
brought by them on behalf of 60,000 flight attendants who had
claimed injury from secondhand smoke.
</P>
<P>
   The six-member Miami jury, which included one smoker, heard from
more than 80 witnesses. Rosenblatt also presented thousands on
internal industry documents, including many uncovered by lawyers
preparing for Minnesota's lawsuit last year against the industry.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last July, Rosenblatt said that one thrust of
his case would be to show that the tobacco industry had attempted
``through diversionary tactics to keep alive a nonexistent
scientific controversy about smoking and health.''
</P>
<P>
   Though many tobacco industry analysts had expected that the
tobacco industry would lose the Miami trial's first phase,
Wednesday's decision, which came just after Wall Street trading
closed, sent tobacco stocks lower. Shares of Philip Morris fell
$2.625 a share to $37.875 and shares of Reynolds Tobacco closed
down $1.1875 a share at $30.875. Loews lost $0.8125 to close at
$79.167.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Feldman, a tobacco industry analyst with Salomon Smith
Barney, said he expected that cigarette producers would seek to
have a higher Florida court decertify the class-action as soon as
the first damages were awarded.
</P>
<P>
   Higher courts can decertify, or disband, class-action lawsuits
approved by trial judges if they find that there are not enough
common factors among class members or if they determine that the
resolution of a case would be legally cumbersome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe this case is likely to be decertified,'' Feldman
said. ``But if it is not, then it would be an important stepping
stone to significant monetary awards against the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Wednesday's decision, some analysts and lawyers suggested
that if the industry lost the first round of the case it would move
to settle the action if it failed to decertify the class.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami trial unfolded in a highly charged emotional
atmosphere. Many of the selected plaintiffs, crippled or disabled
by various diseases, did not testify, but took their place in the
courtroom daily. One man said he developed a circulatory condition
that led to operations resulting in the amputations of both legs.
Others, who had lost their vocal cords to throat cancer, spoke with
the aid of artificial voice boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was ever going to be any sympathy votes it is going
to be in this situation,'' said Ms. Aronson, the analyst in
Washington who attended the trial for a week.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason for its decision, the jury decided uniformly
against the tobacco industry on each of 10 questions it was asked
to resolve. They included whether producers concealed and
misrepresented the hazards and addictiveness of smoking and whether
they conspired with each other to misled the public.
</P>
<P>
   The jury also found that the companies lied and made misleading
statements and determined that 20 of 23 possible diseases were
potentially caused by smoking.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for damage awards, the nine representative class
members and the others who will follow them must now show that they
suffer from diseases that qualify, that their health problems were
caused by smoking and that they were deceived by the industry's
conduct.
</P>
<P>
   If they succeed, the size of damage awards against producers
could easily mount into the billions. And some analysts believe
that they may lead plaintiffs' lawyers in other states to mount
similar class-actions against the industry
</P>
<P>
   ``This could embolden a lot of other lawyers,'' Ms. Aronson
said.

 &HT;    Minority journalists find unity elusive
 &HT;    By Michael A. Fletcher
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sidmel Estes-Sumpter was a lead organizer of the 1994
Unity Conference that brought together thousands of
Asian-Americans, African-Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans
for what was billed as the largest gathering of journalists in U.S.
history.
</P>
<P>
   But Estes-Sumpter, executive producer of ``Good Day, Atlanta''
for WAGA/Channel 5, isn't in Seattle with 6,000 of her colleagues
for the second Unity Conference this week. She is angry because
organizers wouldn't move the meeting, projected to generate $20
million in revenue, from Seattle after Washington state voters
approved a ballot initiative last fall outlawing most state and
local government affirmative action programs.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute within Unity over how to respond to the vote has
shaken her belief in the coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is an insult to NABJ and an insult to black folks
for us to go to Washington,'' said Estes-Sumpter, former president
of the National Association of Black Journalists. She and some
other NABJ members blame ``the other racial groups'' for pushing to
keep the convention in Seattle. ``The point is the other groups
don't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   The affirmative action debate is only the latest racially tinged
controversy to roil Unity, an ambitious coalition of minority
journalism organizations widely hailed as a model of ethnic
diversity and cross-cultural understanding. But while minority
journalists undoubtedly have much in common, their alliance also
has made clear their many differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am encouraged that the coalition survived this debate and
hopeful that we can in the future deal with these differences in
approach to issues in a way that leaves everyone feeling good about
Unity,'' said NABJ President Vanessa Williams, a Washington Post
reporter. ``But personally, I am not comfortable with having to
drop all that money into that state's economy so soon after the
passage of that initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the 11-year-old Unity coalition has struggled
through disputes about the racial symbolism of its convention
cities, the race and ethnicity of vendors it hired, and the racial
balance of its roster of convention speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Native Americans threatened to pull out of the Atlanta
convention because Atlanta is home to the Braves baseball team,
whose name is an insult to many American Indians. A century and a
half ago, Georgia helped remove Cherokees to the West along the
infamous Trail of Tears.
</P>
<P>
   Many Native Americans eventually participated after a ceremony
honoring those who died on the forced march and a panel discussion
on offensive team mascots were scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Unity's difficulties parallel those encountered by minority
civil rights leaders and elected officials. While they agree on
many issues, they find their agendas collide on such issues as
immigration and competition for jobs or political power. Some of
the tension is rooted in the groups' respective histories, their
cultural sensibilities and their view of their place in society.
</P>
<P>
   A 1995 national poll by the National Conference for Community
Justice (formerly the National Conference of Christians and Jews)
found that while racial minorities share a sense of discrimination,
they often have widely varying views of one another.
African-Americans felt they had most in common with Hispanics, who
felt they had most in common with whites and least with blacks.
Asian-Americans felt they had most in common with whites and least
in common with African-Americans. Native Americans were not
surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   Those realities can make coalition-building difficult. ``There
has got to be some real time spent listening to each other's
histories,'' said Sanford Cloud, president of the National
Conference for Community Justice. ``People have to understand who
the other person is and that their pain is not the most important
pain simply because it is theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the four minority journalism groups that make up the
Unity coalition share nearly identical missions: to increase their
meager ranks in the news business and to broaden and deepen
coverage of their communities.
</P>
<P>
   Minority journalists represent just 11.5 percent of newspaper
staffers; 42 percent of the nation's newspapers, most in rural
areas, have no minority journalist on staff. Minorities make up 20
percent of the journalists working in television and 16 percent of
those in radio. Few hold top decision-making jobs in U.S.
newsrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The result, Unity leaders say, is a news industry that rarely
depicts minorities as part of the American mainstream, even as the
country grows more racially diverse. Minorities now account for
almost 30 percent of the nation's population.
</P>
<P>
   A study by the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, for
example, found that Latinos, 11.4 percent of the U.S. population,
were featured in fewer than 1 percent of the 12,000 network news
stories aired in 1997. Nearly two-thirds of the stories featuring
Latinos involved crime, affirmative action and immigration.

CLINTON, AMID THE SQUALOR ON RESERVATION, AGAIN PROMISES HELP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: S.D., Miss., Ariz., Ky., Calif.)  (See also CLINTON-TORTILLA) 
(nk) 
 By PETER T. KILBORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINE RIDGE, S.D. _ Offering tax credits, loan guarantees and
other incentives to encourage private businesses to create jobs and
housing, President Clinton on Wednesday swept into the destitute
Oglala Lakota Sioux Indian reservation, by many measures the
sickest, most hopeless, most squalid corner of America.
</P>
<P>
   To revive Pine Ridge and other impoverished communities of the
kind the president is visiting during his four-day tour of the
nation, White House aides said that over five years the president
wants to allow $980 million in tax credits to stimulate $6 billion
in private investment for businesses and housing. He is also
seeking federal appropriations of $81 million to subsidize and
guarantee loans.
</P>
<P>
   Like other federal subsidies Clinton has proposed in his
six-state trip to underwrite programs, these would require
congressional action, though Clinton has not sent all the specific
legislation to Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is on a four-day tour of the nation's poorest
communities, first in Kentucky and Mississippi, then here on the
Great Plains. Later Wednesday he moved on to Phoenix, and on
Thursday he was headed to Los Angeles. At each stop, he was
sounding alarms about how the prosperity of nearly seven years in
office has passed these areas by and stressing the potential for
help from what he called his ``new markets initiatives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about the irony'' of the conditions at places like Pine
Ridge and those of the rest of the country, with its booming stock
market, 4.3 percent unemployment, quiescent inflation and easy
credit. ``Our nation will never have a better chance'' to help
these communities, he said. ``If we can't do this now, we will
never get around to doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pine Ridge Reservation, with a population about 25,000
spread over more than 3,100 square miles, is America's own
third-world country. It has been left far behind by the current
economic boom and by all of those that came before it. The nation's
second largest Indian reservation after that of the Navajo's in
Arizona and New Mexico, Pine Ridge has institutionalized squalor,
with rampant alcoholism, diabetes, suicide and a male life
expectancy rate of 56.5 years. Children play on dirt. Only 62 miles
of road are paved.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment is traditionally rampant and unmeasurable. Clinton
used a figure of ``nearly 75 percent.'' Tribe leaders say it's 85
percent. Most of the few jobs are with the tribal bureaucracy, the
federal government or the modest new casino, which has 150 Oglala
Sioux workers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton toured hovels that people live in here, including that
of Geraldine Blue Bird, whose shack and trailer house 28 people in
five bedrooms. ``See those houses on the street?'' Ms. Blue Bird
said to him tearfully. ``You notice they don't have windows. That's
because it has to come from the pocket, and we don't have that
pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the president spoke in the sweltering heat of outside
the Pine Ridge School, where many of the kindergarten-to-12th-grade
students board because their own homes on the two-million-acre
reservation are too far away or too decrepit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and other members of his party, including the Rev. Jesse
Jackson, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew W. Cuomo,
Agriculture Secretary Daniel Glickman, and bankers and businessmen
were warmly received.
</P>
<P>
   But a sign in back of the crowd, painted on a sheet, said,
``Stop Lakota ethnic cleansing,'' a reference to the tribe's loss
of the Black Hills northwest of the reservation and their gold.
</P>
<P>
   The Oglalas are the band of Crazy Horse, the victor over George
Custer at the battle of Little Big Horn in 1876, though that
triumph soon gave way to his tribe's being relegated to this
barren, rolling grassland with no marketable resources.
</P>
<P>
   The Oglalas continue to complain of a government in Washington
with misguided policies. They see themselves as a sovereign nation,
and Clinton, Wednesday accorded them such respect, calling his a
''nation-to-nation'' visit.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time a president visited an Indian reservation
since Franklin D. Roosevelt stopped at a Cherokee reservation in
North Carolina on Sept. 10, 1936, while taking a vacation. , ``We
hope the president can open a new chapter of Indian-federal
policy,'' said Dave Archambault, a councilman of the Standing Rock
Reservation, a Sioux site that straddles the border of North and
South Dakota, ``so we can sit down as equals and enhance the
government-to-government relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the tribes need a Marshall Plan, like the one that
rebuilt Europe after World War II. ``That's how you help us become
a part of America's heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made no gestures of that magnitude. But his economic
message also marks a big change in federal policy. By enlisting the
private sector, Clinton is seeking alternatives to the largely
discredited conventions of welfare and charity formed a generation
ago by President Lyndon B. Johnson's War on Poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told the Oglalas and leaders of more than 100 other
tribes attending his speech, ``We will do our part.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We're coming from Washington to ask you what you
want to do and tell you we will give you the tools and support to
get done what you want to do for your children and their future.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been given credit for holding a tribal summit
several years back, one of the biggest Indian gatherings at the
White House ever. Indian leaders also praise the president for
protecting tribal sovereignty in siding with Indians and helping to
block attempts in Congress to curb the power of Indian nations to
self-govern themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But the tribes also say he has deserted them on other issues. In
1995, Congress took aim at the Bureau of Indian Affairs, passing a
spending bill that slashed all bureau operations by 25 percent. It
was later pared to about half that and signed by Clinton _ much to
the chagrin of Indians who depend on the annual budget, of just
over $1.2 billion, for many of their operations and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Indians fault him for not doing a better job of cleaning
up the mess over trust funds, owned by perhaps as many 500,000
individual Indians and held in trust by the government. Documents
showing how much money is managed in these funds are missing, lost
or stolen, and the Indians have filed the largest class action suit
ever by tribes to try and clean it up. A trial is now underway. In
the course of the trial, two Clinton cabinet members have been held
in civil contempt for not producing records in a timely way for the
court case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration has been very good on sovereignty and
gaming issues for the tribes,'' said John Dossett, general counsel
for the National Congress of American Indians, the largest group
representing Indians in Washington. ``If you step back and look at
the record from afar, I would think you have to give them a good
grade.''
</P>
<P>
   But others are sharply critical, noting that thousands of
members of the Sioux tribe in Pine Ridge are part of the lawsuit to
sort out their trust funds. ``Thousands of members of that tribe
are being actively defrauded by the Clinton administration,'' said
Jim McCarthy, a consultant to tribes in the trust fund case. ``For
him to go out there and throw some crumbs off the federal plate is
really appalling, because here you have some of the poorest people
in the country being denied what is theirs.''

   PINDARS CORNERS, N.Y. _ The first lady of the United States flew
into New York on an Air Force jet Wednesday and presented herself
as a potential candidate to replace Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan
upon his retirement next year. Standing at Moynihan's side at his
farm here in upstate New York, Hillary Rodham Clinton described
questions about her residency as legitimate and said she would
attempt to address them in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very fair question and I fully understand people
raising it,'' Mrs. Clinton said, offering a response to the very
first issue raised at an appearance here that was part news
conference and part political spectacle. ``I think I have some real
work to do to get out and listen and learn from the people of New
York and demonstrate that what I'm for is maybe as important _ if
not more important _ than where I'm from.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton than plunged into her first day on the campaign
trail as a candidate, as opposed to the candidate's spouse. She
visited the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, ate lunch at a
barbeque restaurant in Oneonta, and savored the generally large and
enthusiastic crowds that turned out to catch sight of the first
lady and her entourage at every stop. She also held the first of
the orchestrated Listening to New Yorkers forums that are to anchor
her schedule this summer, listening intently and taking notes
during a discussion about education.
</P>
<P>
   It was, by any measure, a remarkable day in the politics of both
New York and the nation. It began at 11 a.m., when Moynihan slowly
escorted Mrs. Clinton up the road from the old school house on his
property that serves as his office to a huge assemblage of
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   As the center of the kind of attention that is unheard of in a
race for the U.S. Senate _ or even in the early days of a race for
president _ Mrs. Clinton began molding a new public image for
herself. With each of her eight answers at the 10-minute press
conference, and then in stops throughout the day, she stepped away
from the role of political wife that she has filled since Bill
Clinton was elected attorney general of Arkansas in 1976 and began
filling in the contours of her own potential candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton rarely mentioned her husband, whose term concludes
at the end of 2000, and the president was not at her side on
Wednesday. The first lady presented herself as someone who was
ready to learn about a state she has never lived in. She also, for
the first time, offered some hint of dealing with the more
difficult questions her aides said they expect, from unresolved
questions about Whitewater to why she may, after seven tumultuous
years in the White House, seek to become the first first lady in
the nation's history to run for public office. The leading
Republican candidate to run against her is Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I intend to be spending my time in the next days and weeks and
months listening to New Yorkers,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``Now I
suppose the questions on everybody's mind is, `Why the Senate and
why New York and why me?' All I can say is I care deeply about the
issues that are important in this state, that I've already been
learning about and hearing about.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``I would be, if I run and am honored to be elected,
a strong and effective advocate on the part of the people of New
York.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The place where Mrs. Clinton headed first _ Moynihan's 900-acre
farm in this one-traffic-light hamlet 70 miles west of Albany _ was
a curious choice. Of all the Democratic senators in Washington,
Moynihan often had the most unsettled relations with the Clintons.
He was particularly critical of Mrs. Clinton's failed effort to
advance a national health care plan at the start of her husband's
administration, and the president's aides frequently complained at
the start that Moynihan was not helping Clinton accomplish his
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   But Moynihan and Mrs. Clinton share a senior political adviser,
Mandy Grunwald, and Ms. Grunwald joined the two of them in their
private 25-meeting before their news conference. Mrs. Clinton has,
over the course of these past few months, repeatedly visited
Moynihan's home in Washington to discuss the potential race,
effectively recruiting him as her most prominent supporter.
</P>
<P>
   As a jaunty Moynihan walked her to the microphone _ a moment
suffused with generational symbolism _ he left no doubt about who
he wanted to succeed him. That said, he almost neglected to say
that as he turned over the platform to his guest.
</P>
<P>
   ``My God, I almost forgot,'' Moynihan exclaimed, then added:
``Yesterday, Hillary Clinton established an exploratory committee
with regards to a candidacy for the Senate, the United States
Senate from New York, a seat which I will vacate in a year and a
half. I'm here to say that I hope she will go all the way. I mean
to go all the way with her. I think she's going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton was assured if self-effacing throughout the day,
taking the guidance of her advisers, who have been concerned that
she may have projected something of an air of entitlement in past
discussions about the seat. She seemed undisturbed as she
encountered a steady if small stream of protesters who challenged
the credentials of this Chicago native to seek office in New York
state.
</P>
<P>
   When Mrs. Clinton arrived for lunch, she was greeted by a small
group of people shouting, ``Go Home Hillary.'' That chant was
drowned out by a rival chant of the first lady's supporters, ``We
want Hillary.''

BOEING PICKS GE TO BUILD ENGINE FOR ITS LONG-RANGE 777 JET 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boeing Co. said Wednesday that it had chosen General Electric
Co. to build the world's most powerful jet engine for a new
ultra-long-range version of its wide-body 777 jetliner.
</P>
<P>
   The exclusive deal, which had been hotly contested, is a blow to
Pratt &AMP; Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp., and
Rolls-Royce PLC, both of which supply engines for the 777 along
with GE.
</P>
<P>
   But both engine makers said that the effect on their operations
would not be too serious because the demand for the new airplanes,
called the 777-200X and 777-300X, was limited to about 500 jets.
``The market for this airplane is very small,'' said Mark Sullivan,
a spokesman for Pratt &AMP; Whitney. ``It really doesn't justify more
than one engine.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing said that the 777-200X would be the longest-range plane
ever designed, carrying 300 passengers about 10,000 miles, 1,200
miles farther than the current model. The larger 777-300X would
carry 360 passengers 8,300 miles.
</P>
<P>
   The victory is an important one for GE, which spent $1.5 billion
to $2.5 billion earlier in the decade to develop a new engine for
the 777 but ended up selling fewer of them than its two
competitors, which each spent less by developing engines based on
previous designs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the only purpose-built 777 engine, and they have
only a one-third market share,'' said Richard Aboulafia, an analyst
at the Teal Group, an aviation consultant in Fairfax, Va. ``That's
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   While the price of the engines values the deal at $15 billion,
jet engine makers make most of their profit supplying spare parts
rather than the engine itself. In exchange for being designated the
exclusive engine supplier on the new 777, GE is helping Boeing pay
for the development of the new jets.
</P>
<P>
   James McNerney, the president of GE Aircraft Engines, said in an
interview that the deal would help GE's services business by
expanding the installed base of its 777 engine. But he denied that
the deal was a loss leader. ``Boeing makes money,'' he said. ``We
make money.''
</P>
<P>
   The new engines will present GE with a technical challenge. The
wide-body 777 holds almost as many passengers as the older 747s it
hopes to replace but it flies on only two engines instead of four.
The huge engines on today's 777s, which are the same diameter as
the fuselage of a 737, are already the world's most powerful,
generating as much as 98,000 pounds of thrust. The new,
longer-range version requires an engine that can generate 115,000
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts estimate that GE will have to invest $350 million to
$500 million to develop the engine.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing hoped to sell the longer-range 777 two years ago but was
forced to pull back after the financial crisis in Asia dampened the
interest of several Asian airlines, which are the primary customers
of the proposed jets. In the meantime, Airbus Industrie, the
European consortium that is Boeing's archrival, announced that it
was building two new long-range versions of its four-engine
wide-body A340.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has still not officially committed itself to building the
new 777s, though most analysts think it will, and Wednesday's
announcement makes the decision more likely. Boeing said Wednesday
that it was tentatively planning to have the first plane in service
in 2003. That would be in time to compete with the new Airbus jets,
which are scheduled to start flying in 2002.

NEW LIBYAN COOPERATION LEADS TO RENEWED DIPLOMATIC TIES WITH
BRITAIN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Scotland, the Netherlands)   By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Britain said Wednesday that it was resuming diplomatic
relations with Libya after 15 years because Tripoli had agreed to
assist the British police in the investigation of the fatal
shooting of a London police officer outside Libya's embassy in
London in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Secretary Robin Cook told the House of Commons that
Libya had also agreed to pay compensation to the family of the dead
constable and accepted ``general responsibility'' for the killing,
which caused the break in relations. The policewoman, Yvonne
Fletcher, 25, died from a single wound in the back, and witnesses
have said the shot came from a window of the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution of the dispute over the shooting marked the
second understanding Britain has reached with Libya in three
months. Tripoli is showing signs of wanting to end its
international isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Under an arrangement largely put in place by the British, on
April 5 Libya surrendered for trial the two men accused of placing
a bomb on a Pan Am flight that blew up over Lockerbie, Scotland, in
December 1988, killing 270 people, 189 of them Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The surrender of the suspects led to a suspension the same day
of U.N. sanctions on Libya, which included an air and arms embargo,
a freeze on assets abroad and a ban on essential oil producing
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council is currently studying a report issued
Friday by Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who said that while Libya
had complied with many of the Council's demands, he was not yet
able to recommend that the sanctions be permanently lifted.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, which has maintained its own travel and trade
sanctions on Libya, told Annan that it needed to assess Libyan
cooperation during the trial, now expected to begin in February and
last up to a year, before supporting an end to the United Nations
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters after a closed-door Council session in
which the sanctions issue was debated, A. Peter Burleigh, the U.S.
representative, said that ``as far as the United States is
concerned, Libya has not met all the requirements'' for lifting
sanctions. Washington broke relations with Libya in 1981, charging
that the government of Col. Moammar Gadhafi was supporting
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The two men Libya turned over in April, Abdel Basset Ali
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, are to be tried by a special
Scottish court in the Netherlands. It was this formula _ promoted
by Britain _ of holding the trial in a third country that ended
Libya's refusal to cooperate with American and British prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Though the killing of Ms. Fletcher occurred 15 years ago, it is
an especially unforgettable event for the British because they
witnessed it unfold on live television. For days after she was
removed from the shooting scene, her police helmet remained in the
no man's land that St. James' Square had become.
</P>
<P>
   There was added poignancy in the fact that among the police
officers who frantically dragged Ms. Fletcher away was her fiance,
Constable Michael Liddle. She died 15 minutes after arriving at
Westminster Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting took place as anti-Gadhafi protesters had gathered
outside the embassy. A burst of automatic gunfire was heard and 11
demonstrators fell wounded. The shot that hit Ms. Fletcher in the
back was thought to have come from the first floor.
</P>
<P>
   The murder weapon was later identified as a British-made
Sterling submachine gun, which was standard issue in the Libyan
Army. No one was ever charged in the shooting, and 22 Libyan
Embassy officials were allowed to leave the building 10 days later
under police escort to Heathrow Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Britain cut off diplomatic relations with Tripoli immediately,
and public outrage here grew when the Libyan diplomats were given a
hero's welcome on their return home.
</P>
<P>
   Cook said Wednesday's breakthrough would lead to the British
Interests Section in Tripoli being upgraded to full embassy status
and an ambassador appointed ``as quickly as practical.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook said that Libya ``accepts general responsibility for the
actions of those in the Libyan People's Bureau at the time of the
shooting.'' The Libyans ``express deep regret to the family for
what occurred and offer to pay compensation now to the family,''
Cook said. He added, ``Libya agrees to participate and cooperate
with the continuing police investigation and to accept its
outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fletcher family issued their own statement saying they had
waited a long time for Wednesday's action and that they viewed the
offer of compensation as Libyan ``acceptance of responsibility for
Yvonne's death.''

FLEET TAKES THE HEAT AT MERGER HEARING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Hundreds of community activists and politicians
launched a volley of criticism against Fleet Financial Group Inc.
Wednesday, saying that the financial giant's proposed acquisition
of BankBoston Corp. would stifle lending to poorer neighborhoods
and reduce competition.
</P>
<P>
   The protests, voiced at a noisy public hearing organized by the
Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, included calls for industry
regulators to delay approval of the historic merger until New
England's two largest banks offer more details on how they will
serve low-income areas and small businesses after they combine.
</P>
<P>
   The speeches injected drama into the usually staid world of
banking. They also highlighted growing efforts by activists and
elected officials to influence bank mergers amid a changing
industry. Consolidation is creating huge banks that span large
areas, in turn raising questions over whether the new giants will
continue to serve their old communities.
</P>
<P>
   With the Fleet-BankBoston merger, which will create the nation's
eighth largest bank, regulators are especially sensitive to
questions over how the new behemoth will make loans to low-income
areas. With over $160 billion assets, the bank will be the dominant
lender in New England, and will hold significant sway over the
ability of less affluent borrowers to obtain affordable housing and
business loans.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet's chief executive, Terrence Murray, told the hearing that
his acquisition of BankBoston would only help New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``By increasing in size, banks achieve the economies of scale
that allow us to invest more in technology and people,'' Murray
said. ``All of us are on the verge of ensuring that New England
will enter the 21st century with a hometown bank headquartered in
this city.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics had the past on their minds as well as the future.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this decade, Fleet faced national criticism of its
lending practices. More recently, activists have produced studies
showing that Fleet reduces lending to disadvantaged borrowers after
it buys other banks.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet disputes many of the charges, saying that most of its
critics are not doing their math properly and that Fleet is the
region's biggest lender to underserved communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like BankBoston, Fleet has been a leader in small business and
mortage lending, helping to revitalize entire neighnborhoods and
create new enterprises,'' said Gail Snowden, a BankBoston executive
who will head the combined bank's community lending initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston has garnered praise for its community lending
philosophy, which looks at blighted urban areas as investment
opportunities. Still, BankBoston's record was not enough to keep
critics at bay on the issue of affordable mortgages _ the major
topic of the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have yet to hear why this merger is a forward step for this
community,'' said Mayor Thomas Menino, who offered the day's
harshest critique of the merger. Menino said he feared that the
combined bank would be more interested in lucrative foreign markets
than in needy local communities.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve hearings are a ritual for large banks seeking to
merge. While the Fed the Justice Department, which must formally
approve the merger, rarely say no to combinations, they are open to
comments. The process has in the past led some banks to make
heftier lending commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, more than 150 people testified at the
hearing, which was organized into 21 panels. About 400 spectators
and protestors packed the Fed's downtown auditorium, as Fed
officials pelted activists and bank executives with questions about
the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the state chapter of the Association of Community
Organizations for Reform Now, or ACORN, a housing group that
channels Fleet loans to lower-income borrowers, told how the bank's
low-cost mortgages had put them into permanent housing for the
first time. Lunita Mustafa, a single mother of six in Mattapan,
burst into tears as she described how a Fleet ACORN land had given
her children a safe place to grow up.
</P>
<P>
   ACORN is upset that Fleet has not said it will renew part of its
$155 million lending program when it expires later this month.
BankBoston chief executive Chad Gifford said that the combined bank
might renew the program.
</P>
<P>
   Debates over that program and the new bank's other community
lending proposals have become a lightening rod for activists and
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet has angered groups like ACORN by declining to sign
concrete loan-channeling agreements with specific groups. Instead,
the new bank plans to work with national mortgage powerhouse Fannie
Mae on new affordable mortgage initiatives, Fleet's community
investment director, Agnes B. Scanlan, said.
</P>
<P>
   Banks are required under the 1977 Community Reinvestment Act to
lend to the communities from which they take deposits.
</P>
<P>
   Still, critics are suspicious of how two banks with different
cultures and traditions will carry out their proposals. Fleet is
generally viewed as more bottomline-oriented, while BankBoston is
seen as more sensitive to community needs.
</P>
<P>
   Not even BankBoston's stewardship of the combined bank's plan to
channel $14.6 billion over five years into affordable housing,
small business loans, and community development initiatives has
impressed protesters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no problem dealing with a Fleet Bank,'' the Rev. Al
Sharpton, the New York religious leader and activist, said. ``But
we do have a problem with being fleeced by Fleet Bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank (D-Newton), the ranking Democrat on the House
Banking and Financial Services Committee, agreed. ``This merger is
a good thing on its own terms,'' he said. ``But it is not a
sufficient thing for what we need in the region'' in terms of
community investment.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Dianne Wilkerson of Roxbury echoed that theme, saying
that regulators should take note of unusually strong opposition to
the merger from local politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent housing activist Bruce Marks of the Neighborhood
Assistance Corp. of America asked the Fed to delay consideration of
the merger for several weeks while NACA polls 75,000 Fleet mortgage
recipients on their views of Fleet's practices. Marks, a
self-described guerilla activist, made a dramatic entrance at the
hearing with 150 supporters wearing yellow t-shirts that said,
``Down with loan sharks!''
</P>
<P>
   Critics also expressed concern about who will buy the nearly $15
billion in deposits and loans that Fleet and BankBoston are selling
to meet antitrust rules. Justice regulators favor a large bank
acquiring at least a large chunk of the assets.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton called on Fleet to accept a proposal from Boston Bank
of Commerce, a minority-owned bank, to purchase 18 branches. The
bank's president, Kevin Cohee, said he had financing from a New
York investment bank, Sandler O'Neill, to buy branches with $600
million in deposits.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to sell it anyway, so let's step up to the plate,''
said Cohee, who said he aimed to create the country's largest
black-owned bank in the wake of the Fleet-BankBoston merger. ``We
have a chance to be heroes here.''

 &HT;    British women slighted by press
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A few more English accents are being detected
around Women's World Cup events this week, which means American
reporters can't resist the urge to make comparisons between the
acceptance of women's soccer here and its virtual anonymity in the
United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper became the point man for U.S. media
questions Wednesday about the difficulties of women's soccer being
embraced in countries that have never done so, despite the success
of this World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do a lot to encourage the federations to provide more
resources and support, but we can't change cultural barriers,''
Cooper said at a news conference held in conjunction with a FIFA
symposium on women's soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Then the subject turned to his country, where women's soccer is
rapidly growing and has a semi-professional league but barely rates
a mention in the British media.
</P>
<P>
   ``The men's game is so dominating,'' he said. ``It's a very
tough nut to crack.''
</P>
<P>
   A handful of British media have arrived to chronicle what is
certain to be viewed as an intriguing cultural phenomenon from
their perpsective. BBC's Radio 5 Live station conducted an on-air
interview with Women's World Cup CEO Marla Messing and a few
newspaper reporters from London also are here through the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Bring on the pressure
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, existing in a male sports-dominated country
like Brazil has its advantages for the women's national team.
</P>
<P>
   Star forward Pretinha said the biggest one is being able to
enjoy the freedom of moving around without a groundswell of media
and fans. She didn't make a reference in particular, but the
Brazilian players are mindful of the circus that surrounds Ronaldo
and teammates on the men's team.
</P>
<P>
   Despite reaching the Women's World Cup semifinals, Pretinha is
doubtful that she and her teammates will be in a much greater
spotlight, although they are hopeful it can happen someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like for women's football to have more pressure,'' she
said. ``But it is fine for the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Haven't I said this before?
</P>
<P>
   They don't seem to be tiring of answering the same questions
dozens and dozens of times. Spending nearly three weeks in the
public glare apparently hasn't had a visibly wearing effect on the
U.S. team.
</P>
<P>
   The elementary questions are repeated over and over again: Do
you think you're role models for young girls? Can you believe the
crowds? What do you think about the future of women's soccer?
</P>
<P>
   And yet they're answered without any hint of annoyance.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's part of what we have to do,'' forward Tiffeny Milbrett
whispered with a smile before the TV lights were turned on in her
face.
</P>
<P>
   When asked how she and her teammates were coping with the crush
of media attention, she teased. ``I guess it's getting old hat for
us now. Hey, I'm just kidding. We know it's something we have to
do, so why get bothered about it?

 &HT;    Lopez's knee passes squat test
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Braves catcher Javy Lopez continued to show progress
in his comeback from a sprained right knee on Wednesday when he got
down in the catching position for the first time since he hurt his
knee in Arizona on June 20.
</P>
<P>
   It was the next step after doing some hitting on Monday and some
running and cutting on Tuesday, and it was a big one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say it's good news,'' Lopez said. ``I was expecting
something worse. I was afraid I couldn't squat down. Today I tried
to squat and I did.''
</P>
<P>
   While he didn't block any balls, he threw some to second base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pull my body up with my right knee,'' Lopez said. ``That's a
good test.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez said there was no swelling or pain in his knee after he
gave it a good workout on Tuesday. But he knows he'll have to let
his knee dictate what happens from here on out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'll be able to finish the whole season like this,''
Lopez said. ``It's obvious if I start feeling pain I've got to
quit. After the season I'm going to get something done (surgically)
if it doesn't heal by the end of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Cox said he plans to have Lopez catch five minutes
of batting practice today. He'll do it wearing a knee brace and a
pad behind his right knee, which makes him a little uncomfortable
at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't go low because I've got the knee saver, and if I go
low it's going to hurt,'' Lopez said. ``It's all a matter of
getting used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Notable absences
</P>
<P>
   The National League All-Stars will play without Greg Maddux or
Tom Glavine this year for the first time since 1990. Glavine has
been selected six times in the last eight years, missing 1994 and
1995, and started for the National League in 1991 and 1992.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first year Maddux hasn't made the All-Star team
since 1993. He's been an All-Star seven times in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be a little strange,'' said Glavine of his three days
off. ``I'm not going to sit here and tell you I'm happy I'm not
going. I'm sure I'll enjoy the days off, but anybody who tells you
they're happy they're not an All-Star is lying. That's what we play
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Ozzie Guillen said Wednesday Andres Galarraga is set to begin
his radiation treatments today and still plans to join the Braves
as early as next month....
</P>
<P>
   Braves general manager John Schuerholz, who named Roy Clark
director of scouting on Tuesady, has yet to decide what to do with
the other part of Paul Snyder's job as director of player
development. He may promote someone from within the Braves front
office....
</P>
<P>
   Walt Weiss was 1-for-21 since returning from his sore
quadriceps, entering Wednesday night's game with one walk, one run
scored and one RBI. He was able to take batting practice for much
of the 22 games he missed but it's been slow going so far. ``I'm
just trying to find it,'' Weiss said of his swing....
</P>
<P>
   Boredom is apparent already for pitcher John Smoltz, who spent
his first batting practice since returning to the disabled list
with a sore right elbow shagging fly balls with one of Brian
Hunter's left-hander's glove.

YAHOO REPORTS SECOND QUARTER THAT SURPASSES EXPECTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By SAUL HANSELL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Blasting away worries that the growth in Internet usage is
slowing, Yahoo reported results Wednesday for the second quarter
that were well above analysts' expectation.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which operates the most popular site on the World
Wide Web, benefited from increases in both users and advertising,
bolstered in part by its acquisition in May of Geocities, a popular
service that lets people post their own home pages.
</P>
<P>
   The company actually posted a loss of $15.1 million, or 7 cents
a share, because of $55 million in charges relating to
acquisitions. Yahoo lost $14.2 million or 8 cent per share in the
second quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
   The company calculated its operating income at $28.3 million, or
11 cents per share. Analysts had expected operating income of 8
cents per share. (The operating income excluded both the merger
expenses and $3.5 million other ``intangible'' charges required
under accounting rules but which companies wish investors would
ignore.)
</P>
<P>
   The company's revenue of $115.2 million was a 156 percent
increase compared with last year's $45 million.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo is the first Internet company to report earnings for the
second quarter. But analysts argued that it was not necessarily a
bellwether because it is increasing its lead over competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yahoo continues to set the bar on the Internet,'' said Paul W.
Noglows, an analyst with Hambrecht &AMP; Quist. ``Across the board,
other companies may not be as strong. But this at least proves that
advertising on the Internet is alive and well.''
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo said it had 80 million unique users in June and that it
delivered an average of 310 million pages a day. In March, Yahoo
and Geocities users looked at an average of 275 million pages a
day.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding Geocities, the company's traffic as measured by the
number of pages viewed increased by 15 percent, but its revenue
increased by 25 percent, according to calculations by David
Readerman, an analyst for Thomas Weisel Partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means they are capturing more and more ad dollars for
every page they have,'' he said. ``What has always impressed me
about Yahoo is that they can bring the benefit of their audience
down to the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   Readerman pointed out that Yahoo's operating profit margin
increased to 32 percent in the quarter from 28 percent in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest concern expressed by analysts was about the
acquisition of Geocities. The company said pages viewed on
Geocities site remained flat from the first to the second quarter,
at an average of 40 million a day. It declined to break out revenue
from Geocities.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition has been somewhat traumatic in that Yahoo closed
Geocities' Santa Monica, Calif., offices to integrate operations
into its Santa Clara, Calif., headquarters in Silicon Valley. And
Geocities users objected to the new terms and conditions that Yahoo
imposed, largely giving it ownership of the pages that users
created. But earlier this week Yahoo relented.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like it will take them a while with Geocities,''
Noglows said. ``But in some ways that is to be expected with new
acquisitions.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenges to Yahoo double in the third quarter as it closes
its acquisition of Broadcast.com. The company said that the cost of
that deal would reduce its earnings per share until the third
quarter of 2000.

   In a conference call with analysts, Yahoo highlighted the growth
of its international operations, which serve 19 countries in 12
languages. Already, one third of its pages are viewed by users
outside of the United States, although foreign operations account
for a much smaller proportion of its revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The company said that its first four international markets _
Japan, Britain, France and Germany _ were profitable, though it was
losing money it the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the company says it expects that half of the money
spent on online advertising will be outside of the United States
and it hopes that ultimately half its audience will be overseas as
well.

   Yahoo's shares fell by $8.06 cents on Nasdaq Wednesday to
$167.06, after rising in anticipation of earnings the day before.
In after hours trading, the stock increased to $172.625.

   PINDARS CORNERS, N.Y. _ The likely candidate put it wryly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really excited about being able to take these long,
beautiful summer days,'' she said, looking out Wednesday toward the
gentle upstate farmland and probably the largest press corps ever
to assemble for a U.S. Senate race, ``and, you know, kind of at a
leisurely pace with, you know, a few hundred of you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Schumer campaign was never like this. The Pataki, Cuomo and
Koch campaigns were never like this. Even Hillary Rodham Clinton's
husband, the president, didn't have as large a press entourage with
him Wednesday as he traveled to a South Dakota Indian reservation
in one of the poorest parts of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But then, the trip of a second-term president with 18 months
left in office was no match for the sometimes surreal spectacle of
the first campaign-like day of the first first lady to seek
political office on her own, with her husband still in the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   By 9 a.m., four huge press buses had disgorged more than 200
reporters and television technicians from around the world on the
farm of Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who in 2000 will vacate the
seat that Mrs. Clinton is considering. A few days ago, bales of hay
were cleared from one of Moynihan's fields to make way for an
enormous press platform that can accommodate more than 30
television cameras and eight satellite dishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I woke up this morning and went out on the front step and
saw the satellite trucks at the top of the hill,'' said Elizabeth
Moynihan, the senator's wife, ``I felt like a character in `The
Invasion of . . . ' _ you know, one of those space alien movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Although this is Mrs. Clinton's 13th visit to New York since
announcing her interest in the Senate seat earlier this year, the
trip was the first to be paid for by her Senate exploratory
committee and not the White House. Still, it seemed a strange
hybrid of an official White House trip and a traditionally bumpy
Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   There was a White House-like press pool and a press center in
Oneonta. And there were the typical trappings of a Senate campaign,
with Clinton aides _ many of them former members of the
presidential staff _ volunteering their time and complaining that
the rented cell phones and beepers were not to White House
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, the press secretary for Mrs. Clinton's
exploratory committee, would not say what the trip was costing and
how much money the committee, formed on Tuesday, had raised in the
24 hours of its existence. But he did offer that ``you don't pay
for these trips in cash.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The sight of the day was of Moynihan, who is recovering from hip
surgery, slowly walking Mrs. Clinton down the road from the
one-room schoolhouse where he has written his 18 books toward the
gantlet of press members in his field.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons and Moynihans have had a sometimes difficult
relationship in Washington _ particularly when the senator
criticized the Clinton health care plan during the president's
first term. But this time it seemed as if the senator could be
giving away a bride, or at least sending Mrs. Clinton off on her
journey across New York, a state she has never lived in.
</P>
<P>
   When the two reached the assembled members of the press, under
brilliant sunshine and cooled by the first breezes in days,
Moynihan introduced the first lady, and said simply: ``I'm here to
say I hope she will go all the way. I will go all the way with
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Then New York's senior senator took on the job of refereeing
questions from the press directed at the first lady. When Gabe
Pressman of WNBC-TV asked about Mrs. Clinton's ``chutzpah'' in
running for Senate, Moynihan said: ``Now, Gabe, we're in Delaware
County. What was this word?''
</P>
<P>
   At the first ``listening'' event of what Mrs. Clinton is calling
her summer listening tour of New York, most television cameras
slowly slipped out of a conference room at the State University of
New York at Oneonta college campus as Mrs. Clinton listened,
seemingly patiently, for more than an hour and a half as local
citizens complained about the education system, lack of high-speed
Internet access and, at one point, the manners of young people.
</P>
<P>
   But the Oneonta citizens were also impressed by the media
intensity of the event. ``We should be historically recording these
cameras for our purposes,'' said Margaret Maguire, an associate
professor of economics and business at SUNY Oneonta, staring in
amazement at the television crews that initially crowded two sides
of the room. ``I've never seen anything like it.''

<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast _ A small nation in Africa took a big step
toward peace Wednesday and a big African nation took a small one.
</P>
<P>
   The warring sides in Sierra Leone's eight-year civil war signed
a peace agreement that gives amnesty and a share of power to a
rebellion that has waged a systematic campaign of terror by hacking
off the limbs of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the belligerents in the vast Central African
nation of Congo agreed for the first time on a framework for a
cease-fire in the year-old war there.
</P>
<P>
   Both developments occurred after negotiations appeared ready to
collapse on many occasions, and the warring sides issued countless
premature announcements of breakthroughs in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Congo, the government of President Laurent Kabila
and the leaders of two rebellions, as well as the countries backing
both sides, agreed on the points that would produce a cease-fire.
The agreement is to be signed by the various countries' presidents
and rebel leaders, though no date has been set, officials involved
in the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This agreement that we have addresses most of the major
problems,'' said Bizima Karaha, a rebel leader and Kabila's former
foreign minister, reached by telephone in Lusaka, Zambia's capital,
where talks were being held. ``We think that this is very
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   According to this agreement, a cease-fire would take effect
within 24 hours of its signing. The agreement calls for a national
debate in which the Congolese government would meet with armed
rebels, as well as political opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also calls for the establishment of international
peacekeeping forces to disarm Hutu militias hiding in eastern Congo
blamed for 1994 mass killings in Rwanda. Officials in Rwanda's
Tutsi-led government have argued that they are backing the
rebellion against Kabila, their former ally, because he has failed
to address their concerns over the presence of the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process that has been launched here is only the beginning
of a long process, but it's a very important beginning to have all
the parties together, collectively laying out a road map,'' said
Howard Wolpe, the Clinton administration's special envoy to the
region, reached by telephone in Lusaka. ``Our sense is that the key
players have come to comprehend how enormously costly this is not
only to the people of the Congo but to the entire region.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the accord for Sierra Leone, a new coalition
Government will be headed by the current elected president but will
include four Cabinet posts for the Revolutionary United Front. The
head of the rebellion, Foday Sankoh, was given a position
equivalent to vice president, though not the title. He is to head a
commission on minerals and national reconstruction, according to
the plan.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-page accord _ reached after several weeks of negotiations
in Lome, Togo's capital _ amounted to a victory for Sankoh, who has
been imprisoned for the last two years. He was sentenced to death
in October, a move that pushed his men to advance on Freetown,
Sierra Leone's capital, where several weeks of fierce fighting left
thousands dead and countless ordinary citizens mutilated.
</P>
<P>
   The government and rebels agreed on the plan only after the
presidents of neighboring nations came to Lome this week to press
both sides to end a war that neither could win outright militarily.
Given this war's history, it is unclear whether this plan will be
carried out and observed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, a peace agreement between Sankoh and the current
president, Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, fell apart within months. Since
then, the rebellion and mutinous army troops intensified their
attacks on civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Pledging that this agreement will last, Kabbah, accompanied by a
little girl with an amputated arm, said at the signing ceremony:
``I shall sign it as president of Sierra Leone, but more
importantly I shall sign it for the thousands of children of Sierra
Leone.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the peace plan, the government will have to work with
members of an organization that has committed atrocities described
recently by Mary Robinson, the U.N. Human Rights Commissioner, as
worse than those in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But with essentially no army of its own and dependent on a
Nigerian-led West African force for its survival, the government of
Kabbah had come under increasing pressure in recent months to
negotiate with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolutionary United Front, believed to control half of this
country's territory, devastated villages and forced children to
join their movement. About 10 percent of the population of 4.5
million fled.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh's group long denied that it had committed atrocities. But
in an interview last month, he acknowledged responsibility, but
denied that the atrocities had been as widespread as reported.
</P>
<P>
   During the talks, government negotiators said that they had no
choice but to broker a peace with Sankoh. Continuing the war, they
said, was the greater of two evils.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations welcomed the signing of the accord, but
formally expressed reservations about the general amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   Manoel de Almeida e Silva, a spokesman for Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, told reporters in New York that Francis Okelo, the U.N.
special envoy, had signed the agreement with a notation warning
that the United Nations would not recognize the amnesty ``as
applying to gross violations of human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our view is that the amnesty and pardon shall not apply to
international crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, war
crimes, and other serious violations of international humanitarian
law,'' Almeida e Silva said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. spokesman said that Annan would present plans to expand
its observer mission in Sierra Leone next week. Diplomats said that
final numbers for the expanded force had not yet been set, but that
the force would probably total about 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   But Human Rights Watch, based in New York, has documented the
atrocities in Sierra Leone, and its executive director, Kenneth
Roth, said Wednesday, ``The atrocities are clearly crimes against
humanity. This is a terribly shaky foundation to build a peace on.

CLINTON MOVES TO RESTRICT STEEL AND LAMB IMPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite a booming American economy, President
Clinton moved Wednesday to restrict imports of two politically
sensitive products _ steel from Brazil and lamb from Australia and
New Zealand _ in response to complaints from unions and farmers
that their livelihoods are threatened by a surge of under-priced
imports.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has justified each of the moves as examples of how his
administration is enforcing dumping laws, a critical step,
administration officials say, to build support for open trade. But
abroad, Clinton's decisions are viewed quite differently, as more
evidence that the United States, while talking up the merits of
free trade, is increasingly closing its borders to imports.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's actions Wednesday underscored how trade has become an
increasingly sensitive political issue, even as the American
economy continues to lead the rest of the world. The White House _
and particularly Vice President Gore, as he tries to invigorate his
troubled campaign _ are coming under increasing pressure to aid
workers and industries hurt by a surging American trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, import restrictions have become part of a delicate
dance for the administration. It is arguing that the only way to
build public support for a free trade system is to demonstrate that
Washington is ready to halt imports of goods that the
administration determines are ``dumped'' at unfairly low prices to
be purchased by American consumers. While that may bolster the
administration at home, it is undercutting efforts to press other
nations to open their markets, particularly agricultural markets.
That will be the subject of a major new round of international
trade negotiations, starting in November.
</P>
<P>
   The action on Brazilian steel is part of a series of steps to
respond to industry and union complaints about low-cost steel from
a number of countries, including Japan, South Korea and Russia.
Under an arrangement negotiated with the Brazilian government,
Brazil's steel industry agreed to ``voluntarily'' reduce shipments
to the United States, hours before a deadline that would have
imposed tariffs of about 50 percent on its imports. Such
``suspension agreements,'' so named because they suspend Commerce
Department investigations into dumping, are also being sought with
other nations accused of selling here at cut-rate prices.
</P>
<P>
   Under the accord, Brazil will reduce shipments of hot-rolled
steel by about 28 percent, and will export no more than 295,000
metric tons to the United States. The Brazilians also agreed to
charge at least $327 a metric ton for their hot-rolled steel, a bit
above the going rate in the United States. While the administration
defends such price-fixing as the only way to avoid dumping, it has
previously responded with outrage when other countries,
particularly Japan, have sought to set floors on the price of
imported goods.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement gives some protective cover to the administration
after the defeat two weeks ago in the Senate of a bill that would
have set quotas on a wide range of steel products. The
administration had opposed that legislation, saying it was a
violation of international trade accords. But tariffs to stop
dumping and agreements like the one reached Wednesday are legal
under most circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The lamb issue ranks low by economic measures _ but it is
politically sensitive with both farmers and with New Zealand and
Australia, not usual combatants in trade wars with America.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was acting on an International Trade Commission finding
last April that a vast increase in the amount of lamb meat imported
into the United States was harming the domestic industry. So
Wednesday, in a proclamation, Clinton limited imports starting on
July 22 to 31,851 metric tons for the next year. Any imports above
that level will be hit with a 40 percent tariff. Clinton said he
would also offer roughly $100 million in aid to United States.
farmers over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The package of import relief and domestic assistance has been
carefully crafted to help our lamb industry achieve sustained
competitiveness,'' Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman, said in
a statement released during the president's trip Wednesday to South
Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   The subject is bound to be a centerpiece of a visit next week by
Australia's Prime Minister, John Howard. The trip is meant to
celebrate the American-Australian alliance, and Australia's actions
to sidestep the worst effects of the Asian financial crisis that
began two years ago. But the lamb issue is a major one for Howard,
particularly at a time when Australia's major markets in Asia are
still hurting.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Seven months after surviving open-heart surgery,
Richard Carter had no intention of being done in by a blackout.
</P>
<P>
   The 50-year-old Washington Heights resident rushed out Wednesday
morning to buy batteries, water and a telephone that runs without
electricity, in case he needed to dial 911. With the elevator dark,
Carter stopped on the stoop before attempting the stairs up to his
fifth-floor apartment, worried not just about his own health, but
also that of his neighbors: the Holocaust survivor with the heart
condition, the old man and his oxygen tank, the elderly lady next
door, clutching her last ice pack to the back of her neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had this surgery, so anything that cuts the air and the
elevators is dangerous,'' said Carter, a professional fund-raiser,
whose apartment building at Fort Washington Avenue and 187th
Street, like several neighborhood high- rises, lacked water as well
as electricity for most of the day. ``But there are a lot of
elderly people in this building who can't even get down the stairs.
For them, this is a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   When the lights finally came back on throughout northern
Manhattan at about 5 p.m. Wednesday, residents erupted in
spontaneous celebrations, literally dancing in the streets. Tenants
of 3810 Broadway, near 159th Street, had already started a block
barbecue to get rid of their rotting foods, and the party was
reinvigorated as people saw the lights of the No. 1 restaurant
flicker on across the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be happy just to be able to stay home and sleep cool,''
said Nestor Chevalier, 55. ``We sure didn't get any sleep last
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Sylvania Ladany, 44, president of the building's tenants'
association, had organized the barbecue after buying about 50
flashlights at Home Depot to distribute to residents for the
blackout.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing is, we learned a lesson,'' said Mrs. Ladany's
daughter, Sora, 18. ``We learned to be prepared. New Yorkers have
to be prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Just hours before, the normally teeming stretch of upper
Broadway was a surreal scene of shuttered storefronts as an endless
line of police officers stood at intersections, directing traffic
in place of lights.
</P>
<P>
   Residents searched for food that had not yet gone bad and ice
imported from the Bronx, as rumors swirled about what had cut off
the electricity and when it might return. One restaurateur gave up
early, setting out a free buffet on the sidewalk that fed several
hundred, before tossing at least $1,000 worth of uncooked filet
mignon into the trash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's like a holiday,'' said Raymond Guzman, who closed his
discount store on Broadway except to sell flashlights and
batteries. ``I got a day off. I never have a day off.'''
</P>
<P>
   Tell it to Jang-Hee Lee, owner of New Grace Food Market, who
said he had lost $10,000 in ruined ice cream, milk, fancy cheese
and frozen fruit. ``Who's going to get this money back to me?'' he
asked. ``Mayor Giuliani says he's going to sue to get money for the
city, but who can I sue?''
</P>
<P>
   Many residents and business owners praised the police for a
quick response to the blackout and their blanket presence overnight
Tuesday and through Wednesday. But they also complained that the
blackout had lasted even one night _ a night many spent struggling
for shut-eye on the floor to avoid the rising heat, worried about
dangers that might be lurking outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very hot, very noisy, very frustrating _ it was very
scary at the same time,'' said Anna Molina, 45, who lives in an
apartment off 181st Street with her three children, and lived
through the blackout of 1977. ``I was walking around the apartment.
I was scared. You have to be alert.''
</P>
<P>
   Robyn Nunez, who lives on 207th Street, said that she and her
family took cold showers and went to bed without drying off to stay
cool Tuesday night, but that the open window near the fire escape
made her too nervous to sleep. Eugenio Reyes took cold baths at 2
a.m., 4 a.m. and 6 a.m. Wednesday, then went to open his hair
salon, only to close it two hours later. Deborah Duffy, 50, sent
her two children to their father's office at the World Financial
Center downtown armed with computer games, and considered spending
the afternoon in her air-conditioned car.
</P>
<P>
   The crowded neighborhoods of Washington Heights and Inwood,
where some 200,000 spent 19 hours without power, include patches of
severe poverty amid grand pre-World War II buildings whose height
made the loss of elevator service particularly burdensome. The
overwhelming flavor of the area is Dominican, but there are pockets
of elderly Jewish residents who hail from another era, and young
professionals have begun to move into gentrifying blocks.
</P>
<P>
   As children frolicked around fire hydrants and teen-agers played
stickball on closed-off streets, many questioned why they were
suffering without electricity while the rest of the city sat in
air-conditioned skyscrapers. They accused both Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani and Con Edison of picking on the less-than powerful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why us? Why us and not downtown?'' said Maria de la Cruz, who
took her husband and her four children to a Holiday Inn Tuesday
night. ``I think it's racist. It has to be something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. de la Cruz's 12-year-old daughter Jhara, the oldest, was
also piqued. ``Basically, they just don't care what happens to
us,'' she said. ``Washington Heights isn't important for them.
That's what they said on the radio. That's not fair. People live
here, too.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Espinosa family sat in their sweaty living room
Wednesday afternoon under the portrait of a winking Jesus and tried
to keep their sense of humor. They were doing what they could to
stay cool, which is to say they were doing mostly nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Elida Espinosa, 59, pushed the straps of her thin nightgown off
her shoulder as she fanned herself with an old lottery ticket. Her
husband, Manuel, 66, who had earlier brought water from the bodega
downstairs to police officers stationed on the corner, sweated
through his tank-top undershirt. Five of their seven grown children
were sacked out on couches _ no work Wednesday, since the trains
weren't running reliably.
</P>
<P>
   When the lights went out Tuesday at about 10 p.m., Isaac Ben
Atar closed Bolero's, his Argentine steakhouse. He returned
Wednesday at 6 a.m. to find the place pitch-black, the food rapidly
spoiling in the refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Atar quickly set up tables on the sidewalk and laid out his
sumptuous lunch buffet, prepared the night before, filled with
meats, chicken, lobster, salads and tiramisu imported from Italy.
Police officers and other emergency workers, along with people from
the neighborhood, gobbled it down before 10:30 a.m. Then Ben Atar
returned to the more depressing task of throwing out the raw meats
and other inventory _ too much to count, he said, but surely in the
five-figure range _ as his employees took crates of lemons,
cucumbers and plantains to a friend's refrigerator in Fort Lee,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no sense to keep it because it's going to go bad
anyway _ might as well let them enjoy it,'' Ben Atar said with a
shrug when asked about the giveaway. ``If I lose it, I lose it, I'm
not going to go crazy,'' he added, lighting up a cigarette. ``What
am I going to do, get sick? My health is more important.''
</P>
<P>
   Back at Carter's apartment building, health was the primary
concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't try to take the stairs, but I'll be fine as long as
I've got my ice pack,'' said Ester Landes, who lives next to Carter
and declined to give her advanced age. ``I'm not going to complain,
because my complaints aren't any different than others. We're all
in the same mess right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Several elderly residents of the six-story, U-shaped, red-brick
building left Wednesday morning to sit out the blackout at the
homes of relatives or friends. ``I'm leaving because the weather is
too wonderful here,'' joked Dorothy Gabriel, 95, as her home
health-care attendant led her to a hired car. ``I'm looking for
worse weather.''
</P>
<P>
   Herman Salamon, 89, who said he survived in a Russian labor camp
during World War II, dreamt Tuesday night that he was outside in a
breeze.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have high blood pressure and my heart is bad, but I have to
face this,'' said Salamon, who emerged from his apartment clad only
in khaki shorts. ``I do not complain because this is the best
country in the whole world. But I don't know why, if you can send a
man to the moon, you can't prevent something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Miguel de la Rosa, like many of his neighbors, said that the
blackout reminded him of his home in Santo Domingo, Dominican
Republic, where flickering lights are commonplace, but that he
never expected to experience the same thing ``in the No. 1 city in
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   When the electricity returned, de la Rosa raced inside to check
that his television was working, then joined the barbecue on the
sidewalk at 159th and Broadway to wait for his air-conditioner to
cool down his apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good because I miss my TV,'' he said of the restored
electricity. ``I'm going to go in right now and watch the Mets
game.''

 &HT;    Anderson misses Falcons mini-camp
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUWANEE, Ga. _ Jamal Anderson's absence from the mini-camp was
noticeable Wednesday even before the Falcons took the field for the
opening practice.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Chris Chandler jogged slowly out of the team's
locker room, glanced at the heavens and said, ``Where's Jamal at?
Come on, Jamal.''
</P>
<P>
   The contract holdout of Anderson, who led the NFC in rushing
last year, officially kicked off the opening day of a three-day
mini-camp, which is mandatory for all players on the Falcons'
80-man roster. Anderson already had missed the team's offseason
workouts and passing camps, but they were optional.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's agent, Jim Sims, and the Falcons are in the process
of negotiating a contract extension going into the final year of
his current deal.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, right guard Gene Williams and kicker Morten Andersen
were the only no-shows on the mini-camp's first day. Williams also
desires a contract extension; Andersen was excused for personal
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamal and Gene both have contracts (for the upcoming season),
and I fully expected them to honor it and be here,'' coach Dan
Reeves said. ``It's not like we haven't had a conversation where
they didn't understand what the situation was. I am disappointed
they aren't here, you bet.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said both players will receive the maximum fine for each
day of skipping mini-camp. According to the collective bargaining
agreement, a player can be fined as much as $1,000 for the team
violation.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons officials were unsure until the start of practice
whether Anderson would attend. Sims had faxed two contract
proposals to the team late Tuesday night, and Anderson reportedly
bought a plane ticket to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   However, the white No. 32 practice jersey stayed in Anderson's
locker as his teammates went through 90 minutes of conditioning and
passing drills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm optimistic about (the negotiations with Anderson),''
Falcons general manager Harold Richardson said. ``I want to get it
done. They want to get it done. We both certainly hope we can.
Again, I'm very optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   The mini-camp lasts two more days, today and Friday. While talks
continue between the Falcons and Anderson, Richardson confirmed
Wednesday that the All-Pro running back probably would not report
to Suwanee within the next 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be hard to do,'' Richardson said. ``With a contract
that size, it is generally hard to get one done that quickly.
Again, I'm always optimistic. In reality, it is tough to wrap up
things that fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to get things done as soon as we can,'' he said.
``The bottom line is that we were the ones who initiated the talks.
There was no necessity for us to do anything. We're the ones trying
to extend his contract, just as much as he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than the comment by Chandler at the start of practice,
Anderson's absence drew few remarks by the players.
</P>
<P>
   Several said they think the no-show is no big deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's business as usual,'' cornerback Ray Buchanan said.
``Jamal is one of the thumping heartbeats of this team, and we need
him here. But at the same time, he needs to think about himself and
the contract situation. He deserves a lot of money because he has
done a lot for this football team.''
</P>
<P>
   Fullback Bob Christian said, ``Everyone understands that this is
business, and this is the way business goes sometimes. We all know
he'll come in (eventually) and won't miss a beat when he gets here.
Until then, we don't have control over it, so why worry about it?''
</P>
<P>
   Offensive tackle Bob Whitfield made light of the situation, with
an eye toward his own future contract negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm under contract, too,'' Whitfield said. ``If (Reeves)
doesn't give me more respect with this heat and all of these dang
40-yard dashes, then I am going to sit out my last two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the team needs to take care of Jamal,'' he said with a
straight face, ``just like they are going to have to take care of
me when he gets his deal. Because if Jamal makes that much more
than me, I'm holding out, too.

 &HT;    Jury finds tobacco firms liable
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In a stunning setback for the nation's beleaguered
tobacco industry, a Miami jury ruled Wednesday that cigarette
makers are liable for tobacco-related illnesses suffered by
thousands of Florida smokers.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic verdict comes in the first class-action lawsuit
against the industry to go to trial and could lead to the companies
being ordered to pay $200 billion or more in damages. The amount
will be determined in another phase of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   And the huge financial hit for the industry might not end there.
The verdict could open the door for similar lawsuits in other
jurisdictions, leading to a never-ending litigation nightmare that
tobacco executives have been trying to avoid by negotiating
settlements with dozens of states.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami verdict is unrelated to those settlements because the
lawsuit was brought by a private attorney representing smokers who
live in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In language likely to shake the standing of tobacco stocks on
Wall Street, jurors found the industry liable for conspiracy, fraud
and negligence. They said the companies must pay punitive damages _
yet to be determined _ that could reach staggering amounts.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco stock prices fell immediately after the late-afternoon
verdict. Philip Morris lost $2.62 1/2, or 6 percent, to close at
$37.87 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange. R.J. Reynolds fell $1.18
3/4, or nearly 4 percent, to close at $30.87 1/2. Loew's Corp.,
parent of Lorillard, lost 81 1/4 cents, or 1 percent, to close at
$79.06 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys in the case could not comment on the verdict because
of a gag rule imposed by Miami-Dade County Circuit Judge Robert
Kaye.
</P>
<P>
   But anti-smoking activists were vocally jubilant.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really a clean sweep, a tremendous victory for the
public health and for the hundreds of thousands of victims in
Florida,'' said Richard Daynard, a Northeastern University law
professor and tobacco industry critic.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict applies to the five largest U.S. tobacco companies:
Philip-Morris Inc., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Lorrillard Tobacco
Co., Brown and Williamson Tobacco Corp. and the Liggett Group. Two
industry groups, the Council for Tobacco Research and the Tobacco
Institute, also were named in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was brought by Miami attorney Stanley Rosenblatt, who
last year settled another precedent-setting case against the
industry. In that case, cigarette makers agreed to pay nearly $350
million to settle claims by flight attendants who argued that they
were made ill by second-hand smoke endured on airliners in the
decades before smoking was banned on domestic flights.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt filed this class-action lawsuit in 1994 on behalf of
all Florida smokers and relatives of smokers made ill by the habit.
The case didn't come to trial until last summer; testimony took
eight grueling months.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of Rosenblatt's argument was that the tobacco
companies knowingly misled the public, making a deadly product that
they aimed especially at youth _ while they hid documents and
research that could have convinced the public to avoid the habit.
</P>
<P>
   ``These shameless purveyors of an unhealthy product have done
everything they could to hook people,'' Rosenblatt argued. He cited
internal industry memos that discussed ways to increase market
share among smokers called ``young adults.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They called them young adults, but those were code words for
teen-agers,'' the attorney said. ``That's where the money is, and
they know that better than anybody. If you hook a 14-year-old, look
at all the years he'll be smoking. By the time he gets to be 60, at
two packs a day, that's profit, pure profit.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry countered with the arguments that have worked
through decades of litigation: that there is no direct scientific
proof that smoking causes illness, and that people have known of
the dangers for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Heim, the industry's lead attorney, told jurors the
tobacco companies spent millions of dollars trying to develop safer
cigarettes and never tried to mislead anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 33 years there have been warnings on cigarette packages,''
he said. ``If somebody started smoking a pack a day in 1966, they
would've had the opportunity to see those warnings 200,000 times.''
</P>
<P>
   Jurors clearly didn't buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Given a complicated 10-question verdict form, after a week of
deliberation they ruled for the plaintiffs on nearly all the
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Among their findings: Cigarettes are addictive, they cause
diseases such as cancer and emphysema, and the tobacco companies
engaged in fraud and conspiracy in producing a negligent, defective
product.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict is only the fifth time a jury has found the tobacco
industry liable for its products. Most of the other verdicts have
been overturned on appeal, and it appears likely this case will be
tied up in appeals for years.
</P>
<P>
   But first, jurors must finish the current trial.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye divided the proceedings into three phases. In the first
phase, the jury was to decide whether the companies were liable.
</P>
<P>
   Having done so, they will next hear testimony on the cases of
nine individuals who represent the class, and will set compensatory
and punitive damages in each case.
</P>
<P>
   In the trial's third phase, jurors will set damages for the
entire class, which could include up to 500,000 Florida smokers and
family members of smokers who have died.
</P>
<P>
   Trial experts predicted the verdict will prompt a flood of
similar cases. Although the companies last year agreed to a $206
billion settlement with dozens of states, that does not bar
lawsuits like the one brought in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now, the tobacco industry has suffered only sporadic
losses,'' said Matt Myers of the National Center for Tobacco-Free
Kids. ``Today's decision opens up the door for hundreds of
thousands of smokers to come into court.

SPORTS COLUMN: AMERICANS STILL DINE TOGETHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Back a few decades, there was a Boston Red Sox
team so dysfunctional that a night on the road was described as 25
players going off in 25 taxis.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, that condition could fit most teams in most sports.
Michael Jordan traveled with his own entourage, emerging from his
cocoon in time to catch the team bus. The noted iron man, Cal
Ripken Jr., is famous for staying in a different hotel from the
team.
</P>
<P>
   On a free night, most male professional athletes go off with
wife or girl friend, agent, lawyer, family members, designated best
friend, or some interesting combination thereof. And why not? It's
a long season, often a long career, and everybody needs some space.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, one team that still seeks that ancient state
called togetherness. In the mad gathering hurricane of the Women's
World Cup, the American players are committed to remaining as close
as they were on the long bus rides from exhibition to exhibition,
when they hoped somebody would show up to watch them play.
</P>
<P>
   This was only a few months ago, by the way. Now the women have
been discovered by crowds with fistfuls of dollars, selling out the
Rose Bowl for the final with China on Saturday. The women have been
discovered by fans who ring their telephones and knock on their
doors. They have been discovered by a chief executive who will
inconvenience tens of thousands by barging in with his phalanx of
protectors. The women have been discovered by television crews who
swarm into news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   The women have now been discovered by Americans, who are said to
equally disdain women's sports and any version of soccer, at least
according the guys at NBC who just could not bear to show this very
same team back in the 1996 Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   This event is hot and getting hotter. Last Sunday's victory over
Brazil at Stanford University attracted the largest soccer ratings
ever for ESPN, a total of 2.9 million homes compared to the
previous record of 2.7 million homes for the United States' upset
victory over Colombia during the men's World Cup in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Something is happening here, and the women feel it. ``Our lives
have changed,'' said Tiffeny Milbrett, the optimistic little
buzzbomb of the front line. ``But we want to keep focused.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no timeouts in soccer, but the women called one
anyway. On Tuesday night, they chose to go out for a team dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of family and friends around, but this was just
for the team,'' said Cindy Parlow, the tall forward who played her
best game of the World Cup in the semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   The co-captains, Mia Hamm and Julie Foudy, organized the
expedition to a Mexican restaurant near the team hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was getting tired of bland hotel food, and we just
wanted to go out together,'' Parlow said. ``We had a good time,
taking pictures of each other. People don't see how close we are
off the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Close quarters do not necessarily enhance team spirit. The
American men were cloistered in a picturesque chateau in Burgundy
last summer in France, and spent most of their time backbiting, en
route to finishing dead last in their World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   And even the American women were distracted in 1995, according
to Kristine Lilly and others, because of bickering over whether
they would wear their sponsors' shoes or the ones the national
soccer federation wanted them to wear. They had four years of bus
rides and ``friendly'' games to think about priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Now they are back in the American version of the World Cup.
Wednesday's news media day at the Century Plaza Hotel was not
exactly the same dimension as the Super Bowl production, to which
the National Football League herds every last bulked-up brute.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilians, competing for third place, sent one player. The
Norwegians, also playing for third place, sent one assistant coach.
The Chinese sent one assistant coach, Yan Zhongjian, who noticed
the Americans were late arriving, and said, through an interpreter,
``Normally, the host waits for the guest, but today we wait for the
host.''
</P>
<P>
   The two Americans, Parlow and Milbrett, finally arrived after
the long haul from their training session in Pomona. They chatted
to the swarms from the news media. They seemed happy to be there.
</P>
<P>
   They have waited four years to get back to the World Cup, and
they still like each other, and they still go out to dinner
together _ 20 players, one restaurant. What a concept.

LUCENT DEAL ANNOUNCEMENT POWERS VERTEL STOCK SURGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Vertel Corp. shares shot up by 58 percent after
the company announced a deal Wednesday with Lucent Technologies
that has the potential to add $20 million in revenues over three
years for the company based in the Woodland Hills community in Los
Angeles' San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Vertel rose $1.09375 to close at $2.96875 on 4 million shares
traded, 27 times higher than its 30-day average volume.
</P>
<P>
   Vertel, a provider of networking software, was tapped by the
telecommunications giant to develop ``mediation solutions'' and
software that will enable different types of telecom equipment to
communicate. The software, tailored to the specific needs of
Lucent, is expected to be a more advanced and cost-efficient
version of what's on the market now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our expectations are that we'll start off working on a couple
of specific projects by the end of the year, and once we are
successful, we'll have other things in the pipeline,'' said Deepak
Kanwar, director of Lucent's Communications Software Group in
Murray Hill, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The new software will be incorporated into Lucent's existing
technologies and sold to the company's clients such as phone
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big endorsement,'' said Ruth Cox, vice president of
marketing for Vertel. ``This is a very important step forward for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Vertel had sales of $4.5 million for the first quarter of 1999
and a net loss of $1.5 million, or 6 cents a diluted share. The
company made $340,000 (1 cent) in the first quarter a year ago on
sales of $4.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 quarter suffered from lower licensing revenues and
higher research and development costs, among other factors. The
1998 quarter included one-time licensing revenues.

   WALT DISNEY SETTLES SUIT WITH FORMER STUDIO CHIEF
</P>
<P>
   Walt Disney Co. and its former studio chief, Jeffrey Katzenberg,
reached a settlement of a lawsuit that had opened a curtain on the
lives of Hollywood moguls whose egos, financial bonanzas and
personal furies are usually kept veiled. And it brought to a close
the glare of publicity that had both distracted and embarrassed two
of the most powerful men in the American entertainment industry.
The terms of the settlement were not disclosed. But entertainment
industry lawyers said that Katzenberg could eventually receive at
least $200 million, including the $117 million that Disney had
already paid him. Katzenberg had initially said that Disney owed
him at least $250 million in bonuses. He later raised that to $580
million.

SPORTS COLUMN: OIL CAN BOYD AT PEACE WITH HIS OWN TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dennis (Oil Can) Boyd was talking about peace, and being at
peace. But Boyd, the intense, tightly wound pitcher, had never
seemed at peace or at rest.
</P>
<P>
   Peaceful, peace-loving, restful, yes. But not at peace. As a
clever right-handed pitcher for the Boston Red Sox from 1982 to
1989, Boyd became one of the most effective pitchers in baseball.
His pitching style was smooth agitation: the ball seemed to come at
batters from all angles. He pitched like his hero, Satchel Paige,
but with deception. When Boyd was sharp, batters never knew what
was coming or where it was coming from. The ball always looked
faster and harder than it really was.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd was intense and busy. Call whatever he is now a truce or a
cease fire. Not at peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't think I'm at peace with myself,'' Boyd said in a
phone interview from his home in Meridian, Miss. ``But I was only
mad about something that I loved so much, and that's baseball. I
just kept asking myself, `Why am I so good at something that I do
that treats me so damn bad?'''
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen years ago this month, Boyd _ with an 11-6 record at the
halfway point _ was on the way to his best season in the majors.
For all his numbers, Boyd was left off the All-Star Game roster.
The late Dick Howser, who managed the American League team, said he
needed extra bats off the bench. Boyd learned about the snub in the
Red Sox clubhouse and flew into a rage. The team suspended him for
three days.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to filter the 1986 explosion through a 1999 prism, Boyd,
who will turn 40 on Oct. 6, said he would not change much. ``I
thought I should be where the best are,'' Boyd said. ``An All-Star
knows he's an All-Star. I'd do it over again. I might not go as
far, but I'd be just as mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Boyd, who was known during his playing days as one who
bucked the system, owns a piece of the system. On May 22, 2000,
Boyd's Queen City Bombers begin their first season of play in the
Texas-Louisiana Independent league. They will play on a field that
Boyd owns, in a 4,000-seat stadium that Boyd is building. His team
will wear gray and silver uniforms with Negro League knickers. And
guess who will be on the mound opening day? The indomitable Can.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm making history,'' Boyd said. ``I'm the only owner that
plays, and I'm planning to play until I'm as old as Satchel Paige.
We own the land, we own the team, we own the stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bombers belong to a 13-team league, part of a growing
phenomenon of the Independent baseball circuit. The distinction
between Independent baseball and the minor leagues is talent level
and affiliation. Independent teams have no ties to major league
clubs, and the level of play is considered to be below the level of
the Class AA Eastern League. Independent ball caters to cities more
than the organization; many teams are named after the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more of a free-spirited game, more relaxed, not as much
pressure,'' Boyd said. ``Independent leagues offer a way for a
young guy to make his way back to the majors. Gives players a
second chance to prove themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Strawberry played in an Independent League when the
Yankees picked him up. Boyd played Independent League baseball in
Mexico after his major league career ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was considered a drawing card,'' Boyd said. ``I thought one
day I could do this and do it for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyd played baseball at Jackson State; he was chosen by the Red
Sox in the 16th round of the June free-agent draft in 1980. Within
three years he was in the Red Sox's starting rotation. He was an
early hit with fans, but the culmination of idiosyncrasies,
injuries and un-baseball-like outbursts wore on management and some
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd, plagued by a succession of injuries from 1987 to '89, left
Boston and went to Montreal. Boyd was traded to Texas, his final
team, in 1991 at age 32. During the 1995 strike, Boyd signed with
the Chicago White Sox as a replacement player.
</P>
<P>
   For the longest time, Boyd was consumed by anger and bitterness.
``There wasn't peace my house at one time,'' Boyd said. ``I wanted
to beat my wife, run my kids away. I was mad with the game _ I
wasn't anybody to live with for a good five years after I finished
playing. Now there's peace in my house.''
</P>
<P>
   He still wants to play, but on his terms. ``I'm not a
controllable person,'' Boyd said, ``I'm not a person who'll jump
for you. I'm not like that and never was. I appreciated what God
gave me more than what man gave me.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyd wants the Queen City Bombers to be his legacy to his
community and his family. But you wonder: how will Oil Can, the
owner, react when he confronts players who march to the tune of
their own drummer? ``I can deal with attitudes because everyone
isn't the same,'' Boyd said. ``I do it every day, and that's the
way I was in the clubhouse. Everybody in the clubhouse knew me
differently. When they played with me, they all could tell a
different story about me.''
</P>
<P>
   Oil Can, peace and the Queen City Bombers. I can't wait for this
debut.  &QL;

IOWA STRAW POLL LURES CASH FROM BUSH
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Only days after George W. Bush said his would be a
penny-pinching presidential operation, his campaign shelled out a
remarkable $43,500 for one day's use of a plot of land outside an
arena in Ames, Iowa, so that he can greet participants arriving
there for a straw poll next month.
</P>
<P>
   To secure the premium spot, the Texas governor's representative
outbid Steve Forbes, the multimillionaire publisher, by $600 at a
silent auction on Tuesday that was conducted by the Iowa Republican
Party as a money-making venture.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Forbes spent $8,000 for a slightly smaller plot.
(The Bush spot is 60,000 square feet; the Forbes spot, 44,000.)
Other candidates spent from $1,000 to $5,500 for their spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa Republicans have never held such an auction, said Ann
Dougherty, communications director for the state party. Four years
ago, she said, campaigns drew lots for the space outside a coliseum
at the Iowa State University in Ames, but did not have to pay for
them. They used the space to greet and feed participants, and to
entertain them with music.
</P>
<P>
   This year, campaigns bid on 11 outdoor spots, generating $78,500
for the state party. That sum is all the more striking because the
straw poll, set for Aug. 14, is a nonbinding popularity contest
that has no direct impact on who wins the state's Republican
caucuses, which will be held early next year.
</P>
<P>
   The financial outpouring demonstrates the important role of
money this early in the campaign. And it demonstrates the
seriousness to which the candidates, particularly Bush, are taking
the straw poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not dream that it would raise the money that it did,''
Ms. Dougherty said. ``It shows that they are dedicated to putting
some resources into the straw poll.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll is the highest profile political event of the summer;
organizers say it will draw more than 10,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week Bush, whose campaign has amassed a
record-shattering $36 million, said in an interview that he
intended to monitor his campaign coffers carefully _ and would not
shower excessive money on the straw poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to support the Iowa Republican Party,'' said Dave
Beckwith, a spokesman for the Bush campaign. ``We didn't want to
support it that much, but that's how it goes. We heard that Iowa
people were grousing that we were throwing money around. But we're
very happy with the way it turned out.''
</P>
<P>
   Other campaigns boasted that they outfoxed the Bush operation,
spending far less for real estate that may not be quite as large,
or as close to the arena, but is perfectly adequate. The Bush
organization will also have to pay about 50 percent of the overhead
costs of the event, including outdoor toilets and electricity,
party officials said. Such costs will be divided among the
campaigns, they added, depending on the value of their outdoor
spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We clearly played the better card game because they actually
had to fork out the money,'' said William Dal Col, Forbes' campaign
chief. ``We will clearly help Governor Bush spend his money.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Kennedy, a veteran of Iowa politics who is the campaign
manager for former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander (whose campaign
spent $4,300 for its space), said, ``Bush is like the guy who came
to the poker game with too much money in his pocket and got taken
by the locals.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to respond, Beckwith said, ``We're more like the guy who
showed up late with a better mousetrap.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The campaigns also tried to outspin one another over who got the
best parcel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the best spot,'' Beckwith said, noting that the Bush
space was closest to the arena's entrance. ``There's no question
about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so, insisted Alexander. ``We got the best space for
$4,300.'' Then, referring to Bush, the Tennessean added: ``He got
arguably the third best space for $43,000. It's not a reassuring
sign of how he'd handle the federal debt.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked who had the premium real estate, Ms. Dougherty, the state
party's communications director, played the diplomat. ``It's
debatable,'' she said. ``Some of them are bigger. But some are on
the main road. If you're not expecting a big crowd, you may not
want a big huge space so it looks empty.''
</P>
<P>
   Other contenders who bought outdoor spots and the amount they
spent were Elizabeth Dole, $5,500; Rep. John R. Kasich of Ohio,
$4,500; Gary Bauer, the religious conservative, $4,200; Sen. Robert
C. Smith of New Hampshire, $3,000; former Vice President Dan
Quayle, $2,000; Sen. Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, $1,500; Patrick J.
Buchanan, the commentator, $1,000, and Alan Keyes, a former State
Department official, $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   But the real winner is the Iowa Republican Party. Besides piling
up money for the spots, the party also plans to put the squeeze on
candidates for space inside the arena.

STRANGE NAUTICAL AFFAIRS IN ORANGE COUNTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEREMY BAGOTT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. _ Why do sailors always seem to have more
fun behind the Orange Curtain?
</P>
<P>
   While one group of Orange County women flags down a freighter in
the middle of the Pacific Ocean, another satirizes Bill Clinton off
Baja California. And an ordained minister who exorcises demons from
ocean-going vessels becomes a clean-energy advocate. Some people
just know how to live. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here they were, idle and alone in the Pacific, on what was
supposed to be a 17-day journey from Honolulu to Newport Beach,
with no means of sustainable propulsion.
</P>
<P>
   They were about six days out with only emergency fuel left in
the tanks when they sailed into a dead calm. The nine-woman crew _
mostly housewives and career women _ were aboard the Volcano, a
64-foot sailboat skippered by sailing instructor Karen Prioleau of
Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   They made the best of the calm by preparing complicated meals,
swimming in the warm ocean and holding a masquerade party. ``When
it's that calm,'' said Prioleau, ``you see the reflection of every
star on the water at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Prioleau and first mate Cathie Mullen decided the crew would
just wait out the high-pressure system.
</P>
<P>
   After a few days of this, Prioleau understood two things: The
calm was widening and the crew's exhilaration was a wasting
commodity. Most had kids and husbands in Southern California that
needed tending to, not to mention jobs and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're in the hands of Mother Nature. When I shut down the
engine (to conserve fuel), that's when reality hit,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Then a white knight came to them in the person of one Paul
Skoropowski, captain of the 13,000-ton container ship Sealand
Challenger.
</P>
<P>
   During the journey, the women had spotted freighters and tried
to raise them on Volcano's radio but to no avail . . . except this
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the (freighter's) radio officer that while we weren't
in dire straits, a little fuel would work wonders,'' Prioleau said.
``The freighter altered its course.''
</P>
<P>
   What had been a speck on the horizon in time became a mammoth
wall of metal.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we motored up, everyone had their cameras out,'' Prioleau
said. ``Then we realized the crew aboard the Sealand Challenger all
had (begin ital)their(end ital) cameras out.''
</P>
<P>
   The freighter crewmen attached a garden hose to a heaving line
and threw it over. In a matter of minutes 100 gallons of diesel had
been transferred several hundred feet in the middle of the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Greetings were exchanged, the hoses were separated and the
freighter disappeared, leaving the women wondering whether they had
hallucinated the whole thing. But, 12 hours later, the Volcano had
motored into some wind. The sails were raised and the vessel's
motor saw no further duty on last year's excursion.
</P>
<P>
   The crew arrived only two days late into Newport Beach. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's dusk along the Avenida Lopez Mateos in Ensenada, Mexico.
Hundreds of (begin ital)norteamericanos(end ital) cram the streets
the weekend of the big Newport-to-Ensenada sailboat race. Mariachi
music emanates from Hussong's Cantina. Vendors peddle T-shirts
outside the one-time Hemingway haunt.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, a half-dozen raucous, cigar-smoking women appear,
carrying a life-size blowup doll of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Meet the Women's Impeachment Committee. With this group, it's
the inmates running the asylum. If President Clinton wanted a
legacy, he has it with this all-woman sailing crew that combines
political satire with racing. It's Jimmy Buffett meets Arianna
Huffington meets Frank Zappa.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, at the race's finish line aboard the 49-foot sailboat
Sky, the Orange County women lit footlong cigars. Suggestively
placed peaches were emblazoned on the fronts of their T-shirts (get
it, impeachment); the presidential seal accented the backs.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``odd-y-sea'' wasn't all frivolity. The Women's
Impeachment Committee scored a victory in the non-spinnaker
division of the race's cruising class.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the race,'' said crew member Jane Hoffner, ``I climbed
into the cockpit after a hard watch the night before. It was a
beautiful, sunny morning and there was only one boat in sight _
(America's Cup skipper) Dennis Connor's. We tried to get his
attention with our blow-up Billy, but he was grumpy. He wasn't
being a fun sailor.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the Newport-to-Ensenada in April, the Committee has been
honing its skills in local waters. ``Next year, we'll probably
lampoon one of the candidates,'' said crew member Susan Pickle.
``We could be (Elizabeth) Dole and the Viagra-ettes.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ben &AMP; Jerry, where are you?
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Joe Warren, skipper of the riverboat Angela Louise, is
looking for a mainstream corporate sponsor with an environmental
bent.
</P>
<P>
   His 79-passenger turn-of-the-century craft, home-ported in
Newport Harbor, is billed to soon be the first fully electric ship
of its kind in the U.S. passenger fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling snubbed by the Air Quality Management District and
Southern California Edison, Warren is turning to the private sector
for sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would think Edison, of all people, would be interested. Go
figure,'' said Warren, who was profiled in these pages earlier this
year for his flamboyant exorcisms to rid vessels of ``bad mojo.'' &QL;

PENTAGON BEGINS ENCOURAGING TRANS-ATLANTIC VENTURES IN DEFENSE
INDUSTRY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon is pursuing a new policy of
encouraging trans-Atlantic mergers and joint ventures in the
military industry, and is beginning direct talks with European
allies and major contractors in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal guess is you'll see more of these trans-Atlantic
mergers within months rather than years,'' Jacques Gansler, the
under secretary of defense for acquisition and technology, said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The policy change, described Wednesday in The Wall Street
Journal, represents a significant turn for the Defense Department,
which for years had discouraged mergers with European companies out
of fear that American technological secrets would be mishandled.
</P>
<P>
   But the battlefields of Kosovo intensified concerns about a
technology gap between the United States and Europe, particularly
in military systems, Gansler said.
</P>
<P>
   During the 78-day air war, U.S. weapons routinely outperformed
European systems, leading to heavy dependency on American warplanes
and precision weapons. Since the European and American systems are
often incompatible, NATO was forced to make several small but
telling compromises, like forcing pilots at times to talk on open
lines because some of the airplanes lacked secure communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be more willing to share our technology with our
allies, and they have to be more willing to control it,'' Gansler
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gansler said both Europe and the United States will have to keep
up with technological improvements. ``The lesson of Kosovo is we
are going to be fighting coalition warfare,'' Gansler said at a
breakfast meeting for journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time the Department of Defense was anti-mergers,''
said Paul Taibl, of Business Executives for National Security, a
nonpartisan organization. ``Now they see the mergers are inevitable
and they're trying to turn a vice into a virtue.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently the European members of NATO devote $8 billion of
their combined military budgets to research and development,
compared with $25 billion spent by the United States. In Europe it
is primarily the French who invest substantially in military
research, said Robin Laird, a consultant involved in trans-Atlantic
defense mergers.
</P>
<P>
   French, British, Italian and German government officials and
industrialists are meeting with top Pentagon officials to discuss
streamlining procedures for mergers with American companies.
France's Aerospatiale SA and Thomson-CSF, British Aerospace PLC and
DASA, the aerospace unit of Daimler-Chrysler AG, are said to be
among the companies hoping to create ventures or mergers with
American companies.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the Pentagon considered France less trustworthy
in keeping secrets than other allies like Britain. But Wednesday
Gansler was at pains to underline that France has proved itself by
protecting its own nuclear technology and by its recent performance
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   According to Pentagon officials and private analysts, the
business trade-off for the United States would be two-fold: It
would help keep the global industry competitive, keeping costs
down, and it would insure that NATO allies were producing systems
and weapons that were compatible.
</P>
<P>
   For Europeans, the benefit is obvious: the opportunity to win a
share of the lucrative American market. Most analysts argue that
the global marketplace has made it impossible to keep out the
Europeans. ``You might as well jump on the bandwagon and try to
control or guide the mergers, rather than become a victim of
them,'' Taibl said.

WITH NO ALL-STAR RESERVES, THE METS FEEL SLIGHTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Mets and the defending World Series champion
Yankees are among only eight teams with winning percentages of .571
or higher this season, but they will have relatively little
representation at next Tuesday's All-Star Game in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   No Yankee was voted by the fans to the American League's
starting lineup, and four were among the reserves announced
Wednesday _ shortstop Derek Jeter, outfielder Bernie Williams,
pitcher David Cone and reliever Mariano Rivera. But Rivera withdrew
because of a personal issue, meaning the Yankees will have three
players, or as many as the last-place Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza, elected as the National League's starting catcher,
will be the only Mets' All-Star because none of his teammates were
selected as reserves by the manager, Bruce Bochy, of the San Diego
Padres.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Phillips, the Mets' general manager, said he was
``surprised and disappointed'' that no Mets were picked considering
that the Mets have the second most victories in the National
League. Manager Bobby Valentine was not happy over the slight
either, saying before Wednesday night's game with Montreal: ``We'll
throw our non-All-Star team out there and hope we can thrill our
fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Bochy could have selected one of the Mets' infielders, from the
third baseman Robin Ventura or the second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo
or the shortstop Rey Ordonez, who finished second to Barry Larkin
of Cincinnati in the fans' voting.
</P>
<P>
   But Ordonez was displaced by Alex Gonzalez, the Florida Marlins'
only representative in a game that requires an entry from each team
in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have more than one guy playing in the All-Star
Game,'' Alfonzo said.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Torre, the manager of the Yankees and of the American League
team, lamented the fact that he could not fit in the Baltimore
designated hitter Harold Baines, who was batting .343 through
Tuesday's games. Fans selected Cal Ripken as the starting third
baseman, and Torre felt he had to recognize the excellence of
Oriole outfielder B.J. Surhoff (.337, 20 home runs) and pitcher
Mike Mussina (10-4, 3.61).
</P>
<P>
   There is simply no room to fit in all the deserving candidates,
Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 23 players in both leagues earned selections for the
first time, including Kevin Millwood, the only Atlanta Braves'
pitcher chosen. It marked the first time since 1990 that Tom
Glavine, Greg Maddux or John Smoltz was not picked.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera, who has converted 20 of 22 save chances for the Yankees,
approached Torre before Tuesday's game in Detroit and told his
manager that he needed to address a personal business issue in his
homeland of Panama during the break. So Torre and the A.L. office
replaced Rivera on the team with Charles Nagy, an Indians pitcher
who is from the Boston area.
</P>
<P>
   Since Torre had already named Omar Vizquel as a reserve
shortstop, Nagy's addition gave the Indians, who had four players
voted to the team, a total of six players in the game, more than
any other team.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Zimmerman of the Texas Rangers, with an 8-0 record and an
earned-run average of 0.89, became the first middle reliever _ a
pitcher who follows the starters and precedes the established
closer _ to be named to an All-Star team. Torre noted the irony in
this because Rivera was among the first dominant middle relievers
in the current era to demonstrate the potential of that role. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ After a blackout that lasted nearly 19 hours, power
was restored to most of northern Manhattan Wednesday, but angry
city officials nonetheless threatened legal action against Con
Edison, saying the utility had failed to build a power system able
to withstand intense heat waves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the city of New York is entitled to a more secure flow
of electrical power than Con Edison is giving us,'' Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani said. ``You can't have too many nights like the night we
had last night and not expect that you are going to kill people.''
</P>
<P>
   The blackout in the Washington Heights and Inwood neighborhoods
was the most spectacular result of a three-day heat wave that
officials blamed for eight deaths in the city _ six in Manhattan
and two in Brooklyn. Most of the victims were elderly _ the
youngest was 53, the oldest 90 _ and all succumbed after their body
temperatures climbed to extremely dangerous levels. None of the
deaths were blamed directly on the Manhattan blackout.
</P>
<P>
   The blackout occurred when Consolidated Edison workers were
preparing to turn two power cables that had failed in upper
Manhattan on Tuesday night back on when one of the cables failed
again, sparking a fire. Con Ed said that it quickly shut down all
power to the entire area north of 155th Street to prevent further
damage.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond New York, officials said the heat caused seven deaths in
Pennsylvania, four in New Jersey, two in Massachusetts, two in
Chicago and two in Washington. Scattered power failures continued
to plague hundreds of thousands of people across the Northeast and
mid-Atlantic states Wednesday, and hospitals continued to treat
hundreds of people for heat exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   But temperatures across the region dropped significantly. In
Central Park, Wednesday's high reached a breezy 92 degrees, well
below the 101-degree temperatures recorded there on Monday and
Tuesday. In many New England cities, the highs barely nudged into
the low 80s, and the cooler weather is expected to last through the
week.
</P>
<P>
   Cheers and applause swept through the streets of northern
Manhattan when, at 5:05 p.m. ET, power was restored to 93 percent
of the affected customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lights went on, and the air-conditioner went on, and
everyone started screaming,'' Kelvin Nunez, 24, said outside his
apartment building on 159th Street. ``Then we relaxed in front of
the air-conditioner. It felt great. Cold. Nice. I knew I was going
to sleep well.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the length of the blackout, police reported only a
handful of looting arrests. But shopkeepers in the area, which is
home to many Dominican immigrants and includes some of the city's
poorest and most crowded neighborhoods, were left to contend with
another problem _ substantial stocks of spoiled food. Demetrio
Tavariz, who owns a bodega on 187th Street, was typical. He said he
had lost $1,000 worth of meat and dairy products. ``I don't know if
my insurance will cover it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   City officials also worried about expenses associated with the
blackout. Though no final cost estimate was available, hundreds of
additional police officers were deployed throughout the blackout
area, which encompassed all of Manhattan north of 155th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he had directed city attorneys to research a
lawsuit against Con Ed. The suit would likely have three
objectives: to seek money damages for public costs, to force Con
Edison to come up with a plan to prevent more blackouts, and to
establish an independent monitor to assess the quality of the
company's power system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night was not a natural disaster,'' the mayor said.
``Last night was a man-made disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   For guidance, the city's lawyers Wednesday were studying a
lawsuit the city filed against Con Edison after the 1977 blackout,
which left millions of residents without power for 25 hours.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, the Court of Appeals, New York state's highest
court, ruled that Con Edison's gross negligence led to the power
failure, but the court also held that the utility did not have to
pay New York City for additional police and fire protection caused
by the blackout. The city could, however, recover money for
property damage from the blackout or any resulting looting, the
ruling said.
</P>
<P>
   But officials at the state Public Service Commission, which
regulates utility companies, said that in studies of power failure
rates, Con Edison had the best performance of the state's utility
companies. As is routine for power failures, the commission said it
will examine Con Edison's efforts this week in New York City and
Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will review the utility's actions to ensure that they were
reasonable and that they complied with their operating
procedures,'' said Dave Flanagan, a spokesman for the commission.
</P>
<P>
   And as Giuliani spoke of lawsuits, his aides were acknowledging
that, despite years of complaining about blackouts, they remained
largely uninformed about the quality, design and load capacities of
the city's power grid.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Hauer, director of the Mayor's Office of Emergency
Management, said the city has enlisted consultants to study the
power system. ``The city will now get more involved in
understanding that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Con Edison officials declined to comment on the mayor's threat
of legal action, saying they were focusing instead on restoring
power to customers. But the mayor was not the only public official
consulting lawyers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   David Paterson, an influential Democratic state senator who
represents a portion of Washington Heights, said Wednesday that he
was considering organizing a class-action lawsuit against Con
Edison. He said many residents firmly believed that Con Edison cut
power to Washington Heights to spare the city's wealthier
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll never be able to convince anybody that it was a random
event,'' Paterson said, a remark echoed by other local officials.
``They think it was very deliberate and they think it was a chosen
way to handle the problem at our expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception in that area,'' he added, ``is that the area
has regularly been denied service and opportunity, and this is just
in furtherance of that same concept.''
</P>
<P>
   A Con Edison spokesman, Joseph Petta, responded: ``If that is
the perception, it is a false perception. There is no reason why
one network would not be maintained as diligently as another area,
regardless of its location.''
</P>
<P>
   J. Michael Evans, president of Con Edison, insisted that the
power network serving Washington Heights and Inwood was designed to
the same engineering specifications and received the same level of
maintenance and equipment upgrades as the company's other networks.

12 WAR-CRIMES SUSPECTS HELD BY NATO'S POLICE IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ NATO military police have detained a
dozen people suspected of war crimes since NATO arrived in Kosovo
25 days ago, the result, officials say, of vigorous policing and a
new determination on the part of the NATO-member countries.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 arrested men have not been indicted by the tribunal and
do not appear on the tribunal's secret list of suspected war
criminals, according to Col. Ian Waters, who, as the provost
marshal, is the senior military policeman of NATO's forces in
Kosovo. He said the 12 had been investigated and detained by
military police where there was prima facie evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The men, one Albanian and the others Serb, are all suspected of
murder, ``murder of a nature that would give it a classification of
its own as a war crime,'' Waters said. The suspected crimes took
place during the 10 weeks of war before NATO troops arrived in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in
The Hague is receiving much stronger support from NATO forces in
Kosovo than it has received in Bosnia, a tribunal spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no secret that we are giving maximum support'' to the
tribunal, Waters said in an interview Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's efforts to apprehend war criminals in Bosnia were
particularly lax at the start and began to improve only after July
1997, when a tribunal spokesman said there was ``a sea change in
capitals around the world.'' Since then there have been 13 arrests
by NATO forces of people indicted by the tribunal in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo is different, not least because those publicly indicted _
the top leadership of the country, including President Slobodan
Milosevic _ are not in Kosovo but in Serbia proper.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, most of the evidence came from either local witnesses
or the military police. In some cases military police followed up
on intelligence, Waters said. ``We have uncovered the evidence,
interviewed witnesses and said, `Yes, this is good evidence,' '' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the 12 arrested men has now gone before one of Kosovo's
new mobile courts, organized by the U.N. mission, and was ordered
held further. ``We would wish to continue their detention and pass
their cases on to the U.N. police,'' Waters said.
</P>
<P>
   The men detained may well be lower-level war criminals than
those who have been indicted, but it is a good start, said Jim
Landale, spokesman for the tribunal. Meanwhile the tribunal is
concentrating on establishing evidence to support the five public
indictments of Milosevic and four of his ministers.
</P>
<P>
   What has not been made public is a much longer list of secret
indictments. In Kosovo only the tribunal liaison has that list.
Waters says his military police can check with that person or
directly with The Hague within minutes in order to detain someone.
Each of the five NATO brigades around Kosovo has a liaison officer
from the tribunal working with its troops.
</P>
<P>
   The military police have gathered details on about 200 suspected
sites of war crimes in Kosovo and have visited and secured almost
every one, Waters said.
</P>
<P>
   This close cooperation, and the speed of access to crime sites
so soon after the war, has made the job of the tribunal staff much
easier here than in Bosnia, Landale said.
</P>
<P>
   With the tribunal's main suspects out of reach in Serbia, it is
the military police who are likely to be the first to bring war
criminals to trial in Kosovo. Within two months the number of
police should reach 900, and include French gendarmes and a
specialist unit of Italian carabinieri.

AS EMPIRE CRUMBLED, FRANKEL TURNED $10 MILLION INTO DIAMONDS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Martin R. Frankel's insurance empire melted down in May and
he prepared to flee the country, he converted $10 million into the
hardest of assets: diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel, the reclusive Connecticut money manager, paid the money
to California diamond merchants for three suitcases full of the
gems just before he left the United States, according to people
involved in the transaction and court documents. The people
described the transaction as frenzied and highly unusual, with
Frankel's security guards flying to Los Angeles to pick up the
diamonds in a private jet on May 5, the same day firefighters
doused burning file cabinets at Frankel's abandoned Greenwich
estate.
</P>
<P>
   The diamonds potentially provide Frankel with a source of wealth
separate from his overseas bank accounts, which he might have
expected to be frozen soon after the authorities began pursuing
him. And they are also easier to transport than their equivalent
value in dollars. But they are also highly traceable and might
prove difficult to sell to legitimate dealers, independent experts
said.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement authorities have followed leads that Frankel, a
fugitive since an arrest warrant was issued in late May, is thought
to have been hiding out in European countries, including Italy. But
he has already remained at large longer than some experts had
thought possible. Frankel left behind documents that suggested he
had researched countries that do not have extradition treaties with
the United States, including Brazil and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   According to federal prosecutors and court documents, Frankel
absconded with $335 million in money he managed on behalf of
insurance companies in five Southern states. The case is one of the
largest insurance frauds in American history. It developed over
nearly a decade before state insurance regulators finally began to
catch up with Frankel earlier this year, prompting him to transfer
money offshore and flee the country.
</P>
<P>
   Just before he did so, Frankel ordered a wire transfer of $10
million from an account under his control at Banque SCS Alliance
S.A. of Geneva to the Worldwide Diamond Company's account at Bank
Leumi in Beverly Hills, Calif. Robert A. Wiener, owner of Worldwide
Diamond, a wholesale diamond merchant, said in an interview
Wednesday that he had cobbled together the rush order in less than
a week from jewelry merchant inventories.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted diamonds that were easily salable in the market,''
Wiener said. ``I said it would take some time to put together an
order of that size, but he wanted them quickly. It ended up taking
less than a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiener dealt only indirectly with Frankel. In late April, soon
after Frankel and business colleagues failed to persuade
Mississippi insurance regulators that his finances were in good
order, Richard Teel of Teel's Fine Jewelry in Los Gatos, Calif.,
received a call from David Rosse, Frankel's long-time security
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Rosse said a client of his intended to buy $40 million in
diamonds as a hedge against bank failure connected with Year 2000
computer disorders and wanted to do so immediately, people later
briefed about the chain of events said. Rosse had known Teel, a
independent jeweler, from the days when Rosse served in law
enforcement in California, they added.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel often used aliases, including that of David Rosse. The
real Rosse is a security consultant who had worked closely with
Frankel since the late 1980s, when Frankel, then still living in
his home state, Ohio, first became concerned about his personal
safety, people who know the two of them said. Wiener, the diamond
merchant, said the man he met who called himself Rosse looked
nothing like the photographs of Frankel that have appeared in
newspapers and television stories about the fraud.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Rosse did not return telephone calls seeking
comment. A recorded message on Teel's answering machine at his
jewelry shop in Los Gatos said he was on vacation, and he did not
respond to a request for comment.
</P>
<P>
   After Teel received the $40 million order, he approached Wiener,
who specializes in wholesale diamond distribution. Wiener said he
warned against seeking to fill an order of that magnitude in a
short time. ``That kind of order would certainly disrupt the
market,'' he said. ``They would not get fair prices.''
</P>
<P>
   The order was then changed to $10 million. Wiener said he
collected several hundred certified diamonds _ meaning each was
accompanied by documentation that makes it easy to sell and more
stable in price _ ranging from one to 12 carats. Most of the
diamonds were one to three carats and varied in price from $10,000
to $30,000. The largest 12-carat diamond was valued at about
$800,000, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosse flew to Los Angeles to inspect a sample within several
days of placing the order, Wiener said. Soon afterward, another of
Frankel's security guards accompanied Teel to Worldwide Diamond
offices, where they packed the diamonds into two full-sized
suitcases and an army-style duffel bag. They then departed for a
private jet waiting at Los Angeles International Airport, Wiener
said.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction was unusual because diamond buyers tend to
prefer that the merchant ship the gems to a final destination
rather than accepting transportation risks themselves, Wiener said.
He also said that the $10 million order was the largest he had ever
received in his 23 years in business, but added that he had no
reason to suspect that the sale was illegitimate. He said he was
merely acting as a supplier to Teel, a retailer he had known for
many years, and that Teel had told him that Frankel came widely
vouched for.
</P>
<P>
   Wiener also said he declined to accept cash as payment for the
diamonds and demanded a wire transfer so that he could verify that
the money was coming from a well-known bank, a precaution against
money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this payment had been cash, we would not have touched it,''
Wiener said. ``I don't think you can walk into bank like SCS with
suitcases of cash and ask them to wire it.''
</P>
<P>
   In late May, the FBI froze Wiener's account at Bank Leumi, he
said. The account contained less than $1 million because he had
already paid outside vendors for the diamonds he sold to Frankel,
Wiener said. He said he was cooperating with law enforcement
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the cache of diamonds will prove useful to Frankel on
the run remains an open question.
</P>
<P>
   Diamonds with full documentation are considered highly liquid.
But the authorities can also notify dealers not to accept any
diamonds that meet the description of those purchased by Frankel.
Because each has its own documentation, the cuts and quality are
unique and are considered readily identifiable by experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of interplay between diamond dealers and law
enforcement,'' said Bob Lindquist, a partner at
PriceWaterhouseCoopers in Washington, who specializes in unraveling
fraud cases. He said he expected that Frankel would have to turn to
organized crime to sell the diamonds at a steep discount.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cash is a much better alternative,'' Lindquist said. ``But
lugging around that much cash is a problem.''

 NEW YORK: other networks.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Company officials continued to give sometimes conflicting
accounts of the events that led up to the power failure. On Tuesday
night, Petta said the network crashed on its own because it was
overloaded by demand. Early Wednesday, Petta said the company
itself cut the power to prevent the blackout from spreading across
Manhattan. Later Wednesday, Con Edison denied that concerns over a
broader blackout figured into their decision.
</P>
<P>
   As Evans toured Washington Heights Wednesday afternoon with City
Council Speaker Peter Vallone, the utility executive told reporters
that the company had no choice but to cut power when a small fire
started in a substation that supplied electricity to northern
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very concerned that by continuing to operate the
network, it would overload and damage the facility, and ultimately
make it more difficult to restore service to the citizens of this
area,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But what remained undetermined Wednesday was why Washington
Heights' network began to fail in the first place, and why several
other networks across the city also came perilously close to
failing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't really tell you why,'' Evans said, adding that company
experts would conduct a complete analysis of their equipment and
systems.
</P>
<P>
   City officials, however, were focused on Con Edison's web of
feeder lines, insulated high-power lines that run underneath the
city's major avenues. By Con Edison's count, 50 of the system's
1,175 feeder lines failed during the heat wave.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day Wednesday, Con Ed scrambled to cope with an
unfolding public relations disaster. They issued apologies for the
power failure. They praised the residents of northern Manhattan.
They promised they were doing everything possible to restore power.
Evans, who earned $616,333 last year in salary and bonuses, even
sought to identify with those who suffered through a long, hot
night. He said his own house had been without power on Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife tells me it was very uncomfortable,'' he said, noting
that he never made it home to see for himself because he was
managing the company's response.

BABES OR BOOTERS: SOCCER TEAM DIVIDED ON THE DIRECTION OF THEIR
IMAGE-MAKING 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Subs to add quotes from Donna DeVarona and Brandi Chastain
and expand on the issue of women athletes as sex objects.) 
(jt) 
 By JERE LONGMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Each night on his television show, David Letterman
has been showing a picture of the American women's soccer team, in
which the players are standing shoulder to shoulder like beauty
contestants and appear to be wearing nothing more than ``Late
Show'' T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soccer Moms?'' the show's announcer says as a headline flashes
on the screen. ``Soccer Mamas!''
</P>
<P>
   The players sent him the picture, and they love the bit.
Letterman has proclaimed himself the team owner and spiritual guru
and has given the American women attention they could never have
expected. But, however funny, the comedy routine speaks to a larger
issue of how the team is being portrayed to the American public as
it prepares to face China on Saturday in the final of the Women's
World Cup at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   To a large extent, the players have been willing participants in
the sexualization of the team _ by themselves and by the news media
_ in recent years. Defender Brandi Chastain has appeared in Gear
magazine, crouched behind a soccer ball, wearing only her cleats
and her rippling muscles. The team's co-captain, Julie Foudy, has
posed with her husband for Sports Illustrated's swimsuit issue. Mia
Hamm accepted being chosen as one of People magazine's 50 most
beautiful people.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Foudy was asked by a television reporter, ``What are
your thoughts on 13-year-old boys thinking you're hot?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop,'' Foudy said playfully.
</P>
<P>
   But it hasn't. The aura has increased as the Americans have
progressed in the tournament. Foudy herself has jokingly referred
to the team as ``booters with hooters.'' And by accommodating a
sexual element as part of their image, to go with their ponytailed
good looks and athletic prowess, the American players have sent a
message around the world that women can be both athletic and
feminine in an endeavor that, in many countries, still carries the
stigma that women who play are somehow unwomanly.
</P>
<P>
   American women's teams have commanded the athletic stage mostly
in snapshot moments of Olympic triumph _ as the United States
basketball, softball and gymnastics team did in 1996. But many of
the soccer players have been teammates for most of this decade; in
general they are older, some married, some with children. The
result is a mature, elite group of performers that has blended
athleticism and pride in their physiques, and is one game away from
a world championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least people know who we are now,'' goalkeeper Briana
Scurry said. ``I don't think you have to run around naked to sell
the game, but it's good to at least be on the minds of people. I
don't think it's degrading. People who see us on Letterman and come
to the game will realize we don't just strut around in our little
skirts. Women play as hard as anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Donna DeVarona, an Olympic swimming champion in the 1960s and
the chairwoman of the World Cup organizing committee, remembers
wearing long-sleeve shirts in public for fear of what people would
say about her muscles, and acknowledges that today's female
athletes enjoy a greater comfort level. ``I come from a different
era where we were punished for our sexuality or accused of not
having it,'' she said. ``Either way we couldn't win. I think these
players are so secure, so confident, they respond the way they
feel.''
</P>
<P>
   The development has not come without doubts among the public,
the news media and even within the team that the American women may
be devaluing their athletic accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a bit uncomfortable with Brandi's deal,'' the midfielder
Michelle Akers said of Chastain's decision to pose nude.
``Everybody has to make their own decisions on how they want to be
portrayed. Regardless of that, it has a reflection on us as a team
and women's sports as a whole. You don't want something like that
to detract from the excellence of this team and the message that
we're striving to put out.''
</P>
<P>
   Billie Jean King, the tennis great and activist who has become a
confidante of Foudy, said that posing for a magazine was a matter
of individual choice, ``as long as we don't take away from the
reason they're there in the first place. The most important thing
is not to diminish our skills as athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of blending athleticism with a sexual presence comes
at an important moment when women's sports are booming at all
levels, and when the women's national team has established itself
at relevant points all over the cultural map:
</P>
<P>
   _In setting new attendance records for women's sports and
drawing television ratings higher than hockey received during the
Stanley Cup playoffs, the American team has become a marketer's
dream with skilled, college-educated, funny, accessible and
attractive players.
</P>
<P>
   _As members of the first generation of female athletes to fully
benefit from Title IX, which essentially forbid discrimination on
the basis of gender, they are role models for adolescent girls who
attend matches with their faces painted red, white and blue.
</P>
<P>
   _As wage earners, they underscore the disparity in pay for women
and men that remains an urgent issue in the workplace, and most
recently, cropped up as a contentious element in the Wimbledon
tennis championships. The American women earn salaries and would
receive a $12,500 bonus for winning the World Cup, compared to the
$20,000 the American men received for simply making the 1998 men's
World Cup tournament and the $388,000 apiece they would have
received for winning. ``If you think about it, the women are being
discounted,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   _As a homogenous group of mostly white women in ponytails, they
point up the limited progress soccer has made in casting a talent
net that would include more black and Hispanic players. In the
United States, women's soccer at the grass-roots level is largely
middle class, suburban and white. Only two members of the women's
national team are black, the goalkeepers Scurry and Saskia Webber.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question needs to be asked, would this team be receiving
all this attention if they looked like the Brazilian women's
national team _ boyish, wholly unglamorous and black?'' said David
Hirshey, the executive editor of Harper Collins, which published a
book by Hamm called ``Go for the Goal.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, the players have been able to find their own level of
comfort, first and foremost, because they have been successful,
having won the first Women's World Cup in 1991 and an Olympic gold
medal in 1996. But King said she was concerned that female athletes
feel pressured to conform to the idealized version of bouncy
femininity represented by the ponytailed figure that is the
official Women's World Cup logo.
</P>
<P>
   Chastain has said repeatedly that she posed for Gear magazine to
show her body as the instrument of her talent and to send a message
that women athletes can be strong, confident and unashamed of their
physiques. It is a message that some of America's top female track
and field stars are trying to conveying by posing for a nude
calendar. ``I'm proud of my body,'' Chastain said. ``I have bigger
biceps and shoulders than my dad. I'm not going to hide it.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Chastain, the defender Joy Fawcett said: ``She just
wanted to get the point across that she feels good about herself,
and everyone should be able to feel good about themselves.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the women are confident that their athletic
accomplishments remain the most important part of the experience.
``You're never going to escape sexual references with women,''
Foudy said. ``If we can make sure we're successful on the field, I
think people will come for the product, rather than what the
product looks like.''  &QL;

CIPOLLINI WINS HIS 9TH TOUR DE FRANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Italy, france, Germany, Estonia, France)  (dw) 
 By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLOIS, France _ Where's Cipo?
</P>
<P>
   To all those who have been asking that question, Mario Cipollini
gave his answer Wednesday: in his usual place, crossing the finish
line ahead of everybody else in the Tour de France and, in fact,
faster than anyone had completed a non-time trial stage since the
classic race began in 1903.
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth consecutive day, a stage ended in a mass sprint
and, for the first time, Cipollini, who is regarded, especially by
himself, as the fastest sprinter around, proved it. This time
nobody pulled the claws of the Lion King.
</P>
<P>
   Forget his 29th place in the sprint Sunday, third place Monday
and 10th place Tuesday. As he explained, ``It's not always the best
man who wins.''
</P>
<P>
   That was then, of course. This was now, and it's different. ``I
was motivated,'' he said. ``The team worked perfectly for me and I
felt very strong.''
</P>
<P>
   He had to be, because Erik Zabel was motivated himself for this
fourth daily stage of 20. The German leader of the Telekom team was
celebrating his 29th birthday and desperately wanted the victory.
Instead, by half a wheel, Zabel came away with his 16th
second-place finish of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart O'Grady, an Australian with Credit Agricole, was third,
followed immediately by nearly all of the 177-man pack, including
Jay Sweet, an Australian with Big Mat-Auber, in a splendid 10th
place.
</P>
<P>
   There was a change in the overall standing, where Jaan Kirsipuu,
an Estonian with Casino, remained the leader while O'Grady advanced
to second place, switching rank with Tom Steels, a Belgian with
Mapei, who dipped to third. None are climbers and are unlikely to
remain at the top in the mountains, if indeed they stay there after
the first of two long time trials on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Cipollini, an Italian who rides for Saeco, was timed in 3 hours
51 minutes 45 seconds for the 194.5-kilometer (121-mile) flash from
Laval to the Loire Valley city of Blois. The speed, 50.3 kilometers
an hour, (31 miles an hour) exceeded the record of 49.4 kph (30.7
mph) set in 1993 when Johan Bruyneel, a Belgian who now directs the
United States Postal Service team, won the Evreux-to-Amiens stage.
</P>
<P>
   On a chilly day and before another huge crowd, the pack was
pushed along by a strong tail wind and covered 52 kilometers (32
miles) in each of the first two hours. Although that speed limited
breakaways, 10 riders tried at Kilometer 61 (Mile 38) and were left
to dangle 20 seconds ahead as the pack refused to slow and the
would-be fugitives could not physically go any faster.
</P>
<P>
   The torture ended at Kilometer 91 (Mile 56) for eight of them,
but Gianpaolo Mondini, an Italian with Cantina Tollo, and Anthony
Morin, a Frenchman with La Francaise des Jeux, persisted. They,
too, were allowed a 20-second lead until the charging pack
relented.
</P>
<P>
   Off went the two. Mondini, who ranked 158th, 20:32 behind, and
Morin, who ranked 90th, 7:07 behind, were no threats to the overall
leaders and so were left free to enjoy the flat countryside that
opened before them: the pastures and cornfields of the Mayenne
region changing to seas of wheat and the first grapevines of the
lower Loire.
</P>
<P>
   Their lead got as high as 6:20 at Kilometer 118 (Mile 73) before
the top sprinters' teams went to the front of the pack to raise the
speed and restore order. By the time the leaders took a left turn
and began racing parallel to the Loire River and its many sandbars,
the gap was a little more than three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Down and down it came, with Mondini and Morin caught about 6
kilometers (3.7 miles) from the finish. Within sight of Blois'
awesome 13th-century chateau, the pack turned right and crossed a
stone bridge into the final kilometer.
</P>
<P>
   In the first three stages, Cipollini's team has looked somewhat
ragged in organizing a pace for him in what the riders call the
Saeco train. This time they got it right and the express went to
the front.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian roared into the final 500 meters (546.6 yards)
behind two teammates and, as the first dropped off, the second,
Gian Matteo Fagnini, provided the leadout slipstream into the last
200 meters (218.6 yards). After that, it was up to Cipo.
</P>
<P>
   He pulled hard for the line and Zabel, trying to pass on the
Italian's left, could not do it. Some birthday he had.
</P>
<P>
   This was the ninth victory for Cipollini, 32, in six Tours de
France and his 123rd triumph in 10 years as a professional.
Although the finish was too tight for him to raise his arms in his
usual victory benediction for his rivals, there was no doubt that
the lion remained king.

METS' FRANCO MAY MISS THE REST OF THE SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JACK CURRY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John Franco is facing the possibility that he may
miss the rest of the regular season with a finger injury.
</P>
<P>
   Franco, the Mets' closer, had a magnetic resonance imaging test
Wednesday that showed a partial tear to the sheath of the flexor
tendon of his left middle finger. General Manager Steve Phillips
initially said Wednesday that Franco could miss from 3 to 10 weeks,
but twice mentioned that it could be as much as 12 weeks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since Franco's finger will be immobilized for three weeks in
what he called ``one lousy, ugly looking, little splint,'' it is
highly improbable that he will return before August because he will
need to regain strength in his arm whenever the finger heals.
Armando Benitez will be the closer at least until Franco returns
and perhaps beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect John to be back this season,'' Phillips said. ``It's
a matter of how much of the season he's going to be back for. Even
if it's the outside of 10 weeks or 12 weeks, he'll be back.''
</P>
<P>
   When Phillips was asked to clarify the two-week difference in
the worst-case scenario dates, he said: ``We don't expect him to
write off the season. We expect him back.''
</P>
<P>
   The mentality of a closer is to pitch every day, something
Franco will not be able to do for a long stretch. And that is
something the 38-year-old left-hander has pondered. ``You have to
have a strong mind,'' Franco said. ``I have a strong mind from
being here for a while. It's not going to get the best of me. I'll
be back. It would be different if it was your elbow or your
shoulder. It's a finger.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Phillips said the Mets were more prepared than any
major league team to compensate for the loss of a closer because
Benitez has been impressive and they have depth in a bullpen that
is 14-7 with a 3.24 earned run average and 29 saves in 33 chances,
they are still down one reliable reliever.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how tense Franco can make the ninth inning, he had
saved 19 games in 20 chances and was a candidate for the All-Star
team until injuring himself in the ninth inning of a 16-0 loss to
the Braves last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm without him right now,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said.
``That's my plan. If someone says, `It's no big deal, we can fill
it,' I know it's a big deal. I have to fill it every day until he
comes back.''
</P>
<P>
   If there was one question about Benitez's abilities as a closer
with the Orioles, it was how he rebounded after difficult defeats.
Benitez has been superb this season with 5 saves, a 1.43 earned run
average and 72 strikeouts in 44 innings. But he has also mishandled
three save opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine spoke about this rebounding intangible as something
the Mets might lack without Franco.
</P>
<P>
   ``If things went wrong when John was pitching, he was able to
take all the heat and come back the next day and we'd be all
right,'' Valentine said. ``We'll have to see how that manifests
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said the former Mets Bret Saberhagen and Rick Trlicek
both missed about three months with similar finger injuries, but
Dr. David Altchek, the club physician, has recommended a different
course of treatment for Franco. Instead of immediately trying to
increase the finger's range of motion through exercise and
treatment, Franco's finger will be immobilized for three weeks in
the hopes it will aid the healing process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I seen what Bret went through when he was here,'' Franco said.
``It was a long process. Hopefully, it doesn't go that far. Instead
of hitting it right away, let it relax and simmer down. Maybe it'll
heal quicker that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Could Franco eventually return and find out he lost his closer
job to Benitez?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to worry about that,'' Franco said. ``I want to
get healthy first.''

DODO CHENEY: A COMPETITOR IN PEARLS AND LACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JERRY BREWER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When she takes the court, the biggest winner in the history of
the United States Tennis Association wears lace: lace dress with
lace sleeves, lace socks and a lace wristband, and if need be, she
will bring a knee bandage lined with lace. And she always has
pearls around her neck. Dodo Cheney takes her style seriously.
</P>
<P>
   She makes the clothes herself and brags more about her sewing
than about her tennis achievements. But her life has been saturated
with tennis. Her family roots are so laced with tennis tradition
that you would think she was teethed on a racquet.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy (Dodo) Cheney, now 82 and ranked No. 1 in the country in
the Women's 80s, has won more USTA titles _ 301 and counting _ than
any man or woman in the 118-year history of national tournament
play. Gardnar Mulloy is second with 135.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney will be at the A&AMP;P Tennis Classic in Mahwah, N.J.,
beginning July 14, competing in the Women's 80s division. In the
main event, Steffi Graf, Jana Novotna, Jennifer Capriati and Anna
Kournikova will be playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who wants to go see a bunch of grandmas in Mahwah?'' Cheney
asked recently. ``There're going to be all these great players to
see. Who wants to go see a bunch of grandmas?''
</P>
<P>
   If you respect tennis history, you should want to see Cheney.
She has been the dominant figure in senior women's tennis since she
was 40. All told, her tennis journey spans 74 years. Her body aches
more than it used to, but she still commands the court, standing in
tennis' no-man's land _ her opponents call it Dodoland, the center
of the court near the service line _ daring the opponent to whip a
winner past her.
</P>
<P>
   If you can burn her, great. But she is a grandmother with a
killer drop shot. And she has extraordinary reflexes, one of the
many skills she hones by ``doing a lot of yard work and
gardening.'' Forget the gym; swatting away flies and bugs while
tending to the flowers can work a muscle or two, she figures.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney had success in her prime, but she never became a major
star. She finished the 1937, 1938 and 1941 seasons ranked No. 3 in
the United States. She advanced to the semifinals of the United
States championships at Forest Hills four times, but she could
never go further. She says it was because she was too busy enjoying
her family _ she had two children, Brian Cheney and Christie Putnam
_ and trying to keep from being obsessed with tennis.
</P>
<P>
   It may have cost Cheney a spot in the International Tennis Hall
of Fame. Despite the pleas of fellow players and fans for the past
20 years, the Hall of Fame has not inducted her, although in the
early 1980s she was given a special citation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sort of figure your career is over before they ask you to
come into the Hall of Fame,'' Cheney said. ``So, maybe when I'm in
a wheelchair, maybe they'll say to themselves, `Dodo should be in
there.' But I hope that they don't do anything until then.''
</P>
<P>
   It might be quite a wait, given how long Cheney has played, and
played well. Sixty-one years ago, she became the first American
woman to win the Australian Championships, a forerunner of the
Australian Open. Nine years ago, at age 73, she played a
10-year-old phenom named Venus Williams, in an exhibition match.
</P>
<P>
   ``She blitzed me,'' recalled Cheney, who lives in La Jolla,
Calif. ``She just wiped me off the court. She was 10, but she
looked like she was about 15. She was big. It's good for a person
to get a sound beating from time to time. It's a leveler.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney grew up in Santa Monica, Calif. When she was an infant,
two of her brothers could not yet pronounce Dorothy and opted for
Dodo. Her parents, Thomas and May Sutton Bundy, were great tennis
players. Thomas won three straight national doubles championships
from 1912-1914 and twice earned a spot on the Davis Cup team. May,
a 1956 Hall of Fame inductee, was the first American woman to win
the Wimbledon singles, in 1905, and won it again in 1907. Cheney's
three brothers, her aunts, uncles, cousins and now her children and
some of her eight grandchildren have played tennis competitively.
Many of them have won championships.
</P>
<P>
   One day, while Cheney and one of her brothers were playing
handball outside the family's beach house, her brother's hand began
hurting. He went in the house and found one of his mom's old tennis
racquets. Cheney thought ``that looks fun,'' and found one for
herself.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney was introduced to real tennis at age 8, and she collected
a Southern California junior championship the next year. But even
then Cheney wanted more out of life than tennis success.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney tells the story of how she was leading by 5-2 in the
second set and serving for the match in a junior tournament. Cheney
began to feel sorry for her opponent, she says, and eased up. She
wound up losing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave her half an inch, and she took a mile,'' Cheney said.
</P>
<P>
   At another junior tournament, she was defaulted from a match for
not showing up. She had met some teen-age boys, and they all went
fishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't that competitive as a youngster,'' Cheney said.
``Now, though, I'm quite a bit more fierce.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's first USTA national title, in the indoor doubles, came
in 1941 when she was 24, but the bulk of her titles came after she
was 55. In 1975, the USTA began awarding gold balls to the winners
of senior national championships. Before then, the senior champions
were awarded silver balls. Cheney has 301 gold and silver balls.
She has won in singles and doubles, indoors and outdoors, on clay,
grass and hardcourts. She has also won mother-daughter tournaments
with Christie.
</P>
<P>
   After capturing the indoor doubles in 1941, Cheney won the
women's clay-court singles title in 1944, her first national
singles title. In 1954, she joined the senior circuit and reeled
off 13 straight hardcourt singles championships in the Women's 40s
division. Since then, Cheney has been minting gold balls; the most
she has ever won in one year is nine.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's so hard to beat,'' said Patricia Stuhler, 80, who has
been playing against Cheney since the 1930s. ``I've gotten the
first set from her many times, but lost. Her racquet is always
back. She never rushes. Her anticipation is incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney plays 8 to 10 tournaments a year. If she doesn't think
the competition in the 80s is good enough, she will play in the
75s, or 70s, or the 65s. She often traveled far from her La Jolla
home, because her husband, Arthur, who died 17 years ago, was a
pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Even if she usually plays to crowds of only 50 to 100 people,
Cheney always plays to the crowd. If she hits an unforced error,
she will say: ``Oh, that's too bad.'' Also, according to opponents,
she, like Martina Hingis, is able to think three or four shots
ahead during points.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how she stays relaxed out there,'' said Patricia
Yeomans, 82, who has won nine national titles herself. ``She's very
cagey. She doesn't move more than she has to, but she makes you
move all over the place. She is just a relentless competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps one day Cheney will join her mother in the Hall of Fame.
If so, she will be easy to spot at the ceremony. She will be the
little woman, about 5 feet 1 inch tall, wearing lace and pearls. &QL;

AID FOR TERRORISTS CAME THROUGH 2 PERSIAN GULF NATIONS, U.S. SAYS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By   JAMES RISEN with BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. officials say they believe that two suspected
terrorists wanted by the FBI have received help through two Persian
Gulf countries with close ties to Washington, complicating the
administration's counterterrorism efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Clinton administration has made no public protests,
it quietly sent senior officials last week to one of the countries,
the United Arab Emirates, to lobby for a halt to a suspected
financial relationship between a government-controlled bank and
Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile charged in the bombings of
U.S. &UR;  &LR; embassies in Africa last year.
</P>
<P>
   A federal indictment charges that bin Laden's extensive
businesses have provided him a cover to acquire explosives and
weapons, and Washington has begun a worldwide effort to curb his
access to international financial systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Intelligence Agency has obtained evidence that bin
Laden has been allowed to funnel money through the Dubai Islamic
Bank in Dubai, which the United Arab Emirates government
effectively controls.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is also confronting allegations by some
American officials that the foreign minister of Qatar told a
suspected lieutenant of Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, a convicted terrorist,
that an FBI counterterrorism team was on its way to Qatar to arrest
him.
</P>
<P>
   Some administration officials said they did not believe that the
foreign minister was involved in the 1996 incident, but that the
United States believed that at least some Qatar officials had
warned the fugitive, Khaled Shaikh Muhammad. The United States
wanted him in connection with a plot to blow up 12 American
airliners over the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Both cases highlight the difficulties of managing relations with
moderate Arab states long courted by Washington, showered with aid
and allowed to buy high-technology military weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The American generosity is meant to encourage the moderate
states to stand as a bulwark against radical Islam, with public
policies and with quiet support for American intelligence
operations.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say some members of the elite even in moderate Arab
states apparently feel a need to hedge their bets against critics
of their pro-Western policies and to insure against becoming
targets of terrorist attacks themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations that the Dubai Islamic Bank is dealing with bin
Laden seem to underscore that this scion of one of Saudi Arabia's
wealthiest families retains some support among the elite of the
Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   Although bin Laden was exiled and supposedly cut off by his
family, which controls construction companies in Saudi Arabia,
American officials believe wealthy Sunni Arabs in the Persian Gulf
quietly share his anti-Western fundamentalist beliefs, even though
they run counter to other moderate Arab interests.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence officials said they had evidence that bin
Laden had a relationship with the bank, which they believed had
been arranged with the approval of the officials who control the
bank.
</P>
<P>
   The minister of state for finance and industry for the emirates,
Mohammed Khalfan bin Kharbash, was elected chairman of the bank in
February, after the government stepped in to prop it up in the wake
of severe financial losses last year that followed charges of
embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. official who went to the Emirates last week said
that officials were ``responsive'' to American concerns about the
Dubai bank's involvement with bin Laden. But the official refused
to provide details about the meetings, which included Treasury
Department and National Security Council officials. The American
officials also declined to say how much money they believed that
bin Laden had funneled through the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden is believed to be living in Afghanistan under the
protection of the Taliban. Estimates of his wealth vary widely.
Some analysts say they are convinced that he has just a few million
dollars left from his vast inheritance. The Central Intelligence
Agency estimates that he has up to $250 million, including assets
in legitimate businesses.
</P>
<P>
   A press adviser in the Emirates Embassy here, Edmund Ghareeb,
said he could not comment on the suspected bank dealings. The Qatar
ambassador to the United States, Saad Mohammed al-Kobasi, declined
to comment on the allegations against officials in his country.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has refrained from public comment on
either case, apparently fearing damage to relations with two
oil-rich Arab states that have generally supported American
policies in the region and that also help American military
operations in the gulf.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For years, the main port of call for U.S. warships in the gulf
was in the Emirates. Last year, the country agreed to pay $8
billion for F-16 fighters, a major boost for Lockheed Martin.
</P>
<P>
   In Qatar, construction is under way on what United States
officials say will be the Pentagon's largest prepositioning supply
base outside the United States. When the $178 million complex is
completed in about a year, it will support up to 10,000 troops and
5,000 vehicles, aiding operations against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Gulf War, Qatar has also deepened its economic ties,
cutting deals with American oil companies like Occidental Petroleum
and Mobil. Breaking with its larger neighbor, Saudi Arabia, Qatar
also became the first gulf state to establish open trade relations
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Its foreign minister, Sheik Hamed bin Jasim al Thani, plays a
significant role in the relationship with Washington. He has met
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright two times, in November and
February, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Qatar case centers on efforts to arrest Muhammad in
connection with Yousef's plot to destroy the airliners. Yousef was
convicted in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center in
Manhattan. In January 1996, the United States secretly indicted
Muhammad as an accomplice in the airliner plot.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment charged that in late 1994 and early 1995,
Muhammad lived in Yousef's apartment in Manila, where they kept
explosive devices and chemicals. Federal prosecutors have also said
they believe Muhammad helped Yousef devise and finance the airliner
plot.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1996, American authorities learned that Muhammad was
living in the capital of Qatar, Doha, and working at the Public
Works Ministry, said one official.
</P>
<P>
   The American ambassador to Qatar, Patrick N. Theros, a former
counterterrorism official in the State Department, met Qatar
officials and reported that he was optimistic that Qatar would be
willing to arrest Muhammad and turn him over to the United States,
officials recounted.
</P>
<P>
   There was a recent precedent such an action. About a year
earlier, the United States sent a plane to Pakistan after the
authorities there arrested Yousef and agreed to turn him over to
the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, however, found itself thwarted in its attempt to catch
Muhammad. Its agents, sent to Doha in early 1996, were told that
the suspect, who had been under surveillance, was now nowhere to be
found. A Qatar police search of a beachfront estate where the
officers had been told that Muhammad was staying, proved fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI spent about a week awaiting word of Muhammad's
whereabouts; they returned to the United States empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   American officials now say they believe that Muhammad was warned
by someone in the Qatar government and that he was staying at the
estate of Abdallah bin Khalid, a fundamentalist who has provided
support for other Islamic radicals. A former American intelligence
official said bin Laden also visited bin Khalid in Qatar twice in
the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Although American officials said they had no conclusive proof,
current and former officials said they believed that the foreign
minister was involved, directly or indirectly.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign minister declined to comment for this article.
</P>
<P>
   American officials also noted that the raid occurred at a time
of confusion in Qatar, which might have contributed to its failure.
In the summer of 1995, the ruler of Qatar was overthrown by his
son. In early 1996, about the time of the FBI action, the father
was staging an unsuccessful countercoup.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after the fruitless FBI action, Federal prosecutors in
Manhattan unsealed the indictment against Muhammad. A $5 million
reward for information leading to his arrest or conviction is being
offered.

 A 4th REPUBLICAN BLOCKS VOTE ON HOLBROOKE'S CONFIRMATION  
(jt) 
 By PHILIP SHENON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The long-delayed nomination of Richard C. Holbrooke
to be chief American diplomat to the United Nations hit a new snag
Wednesday, as another Republican senator disclosed that he was
blocking a final Senate vote on the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmaker, Sen. George V. Voinovich of Ohio, said he had
placed a ``hold'' on the nomination out of concern over Holbrooke's
leading role in policymaking in the Balkans during the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional and other government officials said that at least
three other Republican senators are also exercising their right
under Senate rules to block a final vote on the veteran diplomat's
nomination: Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi, Mitch
McConnell of Kentucky and Charles E. Grassley of Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that Lott and McConnell, who have not publicly
acknowledged their holds on the nomination, are refusing to permit
a Senate vote on Holbrooke until the White House agrees to name a
conservative Ohio law professor to the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley, who has acknowledged his role in blocking Holbrooke's
nomination, said he would not lift his hold until the State
Department reached an accommodation with an employee he considers a
whistle-blower in a matter unrelated to Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials expressed exasperation at the
delay in the confirmation of Holbrooke, whose nomination was held
up for most of the last year as a result of federal ethics
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   The investigations ended without any criminal charges. Holbrooke
paid $5,000 to settle civil charges that he had violated federal
lobbying laws, but said he had done nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has been without a so-called permanent
representative at the United Nations since September, when Bill
Richardson left the post to become energy secretary. Holbrooke's
nomination was approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
on a voice vote last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard Holbrooke is eminently qualified to be the U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations,'' said P.J. Crowley, a White
House spokesman. ``His track record in working difficult issues in
the Balkans speaks for itself. We believe the Senate should vote as
quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   James Foley, a State Department spokesman, said, ``We don't
believe that issues external to Holbrooke's qualifications should
be linked to his confirmation.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Lott, McConnell and Grassley, however, Voinovich is
questioning Holbrooke's qualifications. Voinovich has been a fierce
critic of the administration's policy in the Balkans _ and
specifically, of the NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia this
spring.
</P>
<P>
   The senator's spokesman, Mike Dawson, said that the lawmaker had
placed the hold on the nomination last week and that it would
remain in place until the senator's staff had completed a review of
Holbrooke's role in Balkans policy.
</P>
<P>
   Dawson said that Voinovich would also insist that if there is a
vote on Holbrooke's nomination, that it done by roll call, so that
each senator's vote be registered publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for McConnell did not return calls. A spokesman for
Lott, John Czwartacki, would not comment on whether _ or why _ the
majority leader was blocking Holbrooke's nomination.  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The Solomon Islands, the group of tropical
Pacific islands that witnessed some of World War II's most
intensive battles, is once again the scene of strife, this time of
its own making.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials said Wednesday that at least six people had been
killed and 15,000 to 20,000 people had been forced to flee their
homes by ethnic conflict on Guadalcanal, the main island and scene
of the big World War II battle.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin M. Kennedy, chief of the emergency liaison branch of the
office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs, said the
United Nations would support a mediation effort by the Commonwealth
and would help the Red Cross provide food and housing to those
displaced by the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said that according to refugees, small bands of lightly
armed militant Gwales, the majority population on Guadalcanal, had
already driven out most of the minority population of Malaitan
villagers from the countryside. The Malaitas had come to
Gaudalcanal, often a generation or two ago, from the island of
Malaita, 60 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds more Malaitas have been harassed or frightened into
fleeing to the capital, Honiara, whose population is mostly
Malaitan. Many are now sleeping on the streets, Kennedy said.
Others have sought refuge with friends or relatives on Malaita,
placing additional burdens on a population of mostly subsistence
farmers and fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   ``These terrified people are unlikely to return to their homes
any time soon,'' Kennedy said in an interview, ``and certainly not
until their safety can be assured.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations sent its mission in response to an appeal
from Bartholomew Ulufa'alu, a Malaitan who is prime minister and
who invited the Commonwealth to mediate an end to the dispute.
Sitiveni Rabuka, Fiji's former prime minister, has been trying to
negotiate an end to the violence.
</P>
<P>
   Occupying an area that is slightly smaller than Maryland with a
population of about 440,000, the Solomon Islands, which gained
independence from Britain in 1978, is a democracy known for its
fractious Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats said that while the ethnic tensions among Guadalcanal
residents goes back decades, fighting erupted last April when small
gangs of jobless armed men began purging the Malaitans from their
villages around Honiara Province to protest what they saw as
preferential employment treatment given Malaitans on the island,
where about 115,000 people live.
</P>
<P>
   After speaking to correspondents about the situation in the
Solomon Islands, from which he has just returned, Kennedy was taken
aback by a reporter who asked why the United Nations should spend
time and money on a place where the death toll was ``small
potatoes'' compared with the suffering in other parts of the world,
like Africa and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well it's not small potatoes to the people who've been driven
out of their homes,'' Kennedy replied. ``In the context of the
country, which has not seen very much violence in recent decades,
it's a major crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Solomon Islanders are concerned that the strife will adversely
affect the nation's struggling economy and a population afflicted
with one of the world's highest rates of malaria. In addition to
the export of palm oil, which accounts for about 20 percent of
gross domestic product, the islanders sustain themselves through
farming and fishing.
</P>
<P>
   The Solomons are a destination for some 12,000 tourists a year,
many of them World War II veterans who return to see the places
where they or their comrades fought in the six-month campaign to
regain the islands from Japanese forces in 1942 and 1943. About
6,000 American soldiers died there.

COMIC STRIP'S FANS COME OUT IN DROVES AFTER CREATOR CRITICIZED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer

<P>
   SEATTLE _ A funny thing happened to Aaron McGruder on his way to
being fried in the forum.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of continuing to scorch him with insults, the public has
begun showering him with praise for creating ``The Boondocks,'' a
brash, controversial, black-oriented comic strip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clever and multilayered,'' weighs in one Seattle newspaper
reader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speaks the truth,'' praises another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thought-provoking ... makes me laugh,'' exhorts a fan.
</P>
<P>
   Plus _ his groupies point out _ McGruder is darn tootin' cute.
</P>
<P>
   So what's not to like?
</P>
<P>
   Well, plenty _ or so you would have thought from early reaction
to the strip.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, after the Seattle Post-Intelligencer and dozens of
other newspapers across the country started carrying McGruder's
provocative comic, it appeared he might have sketched himself into
a very tight corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Boondocks'' brings a spicy cast of characters to the
nation's vanilla funny pages by presenting the lives of four
urbanly hip kids who speak the language of hip-hop and live in a
Wonder Bread suburb.
</P>
<P>
   There's Huey Freeman, the black nationalist with a heart of
gold; Riley, Huey's younger brother, who projects a gangsta air;
their buddy Caesar, who totes a microphone; and Jazmine, a biracial
neighbor confused about her racial identity.
</P>
<P>
   They inhabit a strip that hits hot-button issues.
</P>
<P>
   In one recent installment, Huey, named for former Black Panther
Huey P. Newton, makes random stops of white motorists as part of
``Operation Klanwatch.'' In another strip, Riley knocks down a
white girl with a toy lightsaber and huffs: ``See?! You're still
alive! This thing is worthless!''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for the ``Boon-lash'' to register with a
vocal minority of Seattle readers. Thirty-one of 33 readers who
blitzed this paper's reader representative phone line blasted the
strip for being ``racist,'' ``indulgent'' and ``not very funny.''
And many of those readers especially hated the lightsaber strip,
which they said encouraged violence among young people.
</P>
<P>
   After the Post-Intelligencer published some of those concerns in
a lengthy story about McGruder on June 28, supporters of the strip
emerged in droves.
</P>
<P>
   More than 130 people contacted the Post-Intelligencer, using
phone calls, e-mail and snail-mail letters. A majority of them _
roughly 80 percent _ wanted to keep the ``The Boondocks'' around,
citing its timely social commentary, panache and
Japanese-influenced art style.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a breath of fresh perspective and relevant commentary on
race relations in America today,'' writes Dennis MacCoumber of
Seattle, who adds, ``McGruder gives us old dudes who have no
contact with young blacks some hint of what another culture may be
thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Stacy Vennema of Bellingham writes: ``Boondocks is, in my
opinion, equal-opportunity satire, exposing attitudes and
assumptions of both white and black characters.''
</P>
<P>
   Dean Barnes says: ``McGruder strikes a nerve because he is
putting racial satire in a comic setting where most (people) expect
non-confrontational humor.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of confrontation, Sally Wolff of Coupeville saw no
racial animosity in the lightsaber strip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took it the way the cartoonist intended _ a boy who was
disappointed that his lightsaber didn't work like the ones in the
`Phantom Menace' movie,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some black readers said critics of the strip may be
unaccustomed to or uncomfortable with artistic depictions of young,
intelligent blacks who call it like they see it. Many callers said
McGruder deftly skewers those liberals who believe the race
question is passe.
</P>
<P>
   His support crosses party lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the liberals don't have a sense of humor. What else is
new,'' huffs Dave Cavanaugh in an e-mail message. ``Just for the
record, I'm a 46-year-old white, Goldwater conservative, and I
think `Boondocks' is one of the better strips around.''
</P>
<P>
   For several readers the bottom line was this: Keep ``The
Boondocks'' or lose a subscriber. (Post-Intelligencer managing
editor Ken Bunting said he is ``watching carefully'' as the strip's
story line develops.)
</P>
<P>
   Seattle resident Meri Tahset, who had been getting the strip
e-mailed to her by friends, said she would subscribe to the paper
just for ``The Boondocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Tahset, who is black and grew up in Detroit, said McGruder's
insights humorously speak to challenges she faces living in a
predominantly white city. Racial intolerance, she says, boils below
the surface in Seattle, a liberal pocket in a state that recently
passed an anti-affirmative action initiative. ```The Boondocks' has
me feeling like I can last here,'' she says, adding ``I just hope
Aaron doesn't get watered down.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, McGruder has received praise and criticism
in cities where his strip runs, including Atlanta, Chicago and Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   More than 180 newspapers carry his strip, a remarkable
accomplishment for a man who just turned 25 and lives at home with
his mother and father in suburban Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   To date, three newspapers have dropped the strip and moved out
of ``The Boondocks'': The Greenville News and The Aiken Standard,
both in South Carolina, and The Independent in Massillon, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Hunter, publisher of The Aiken Standard, which has a daily
circulation of 14,000, said ``The Boondocks'' was ``not working''
in his community 50 miles southwest of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just wasn't funny,'' said Hunter, who had ordered up
advance editions of the strip, only to discover that his funny bone
was untickled. ``Maybe it would go over well in much larger
cities.''
</P>
<P>
   In Southern California, where ``The Boondocks'' appears in the
Los Angeles Times, that paper reported nearly 100 complaints
shortly after the strip's debut.
</P>
<P>
   But after the paper published a feature story on McGruder, his
fans started popping up. To date, the paper has received more than
500 responses, split roughly down the middle between his supporters
and detractors, said Narda Zacchino, the paper's associate editor
and reader representative.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most significant contribution by (McGruder) is that people
are talking about race issues as a result of his strip,'' said
Zacchino.
</P>
<P>
   Kathie Kerr, spokeswoman for Universal Press Syndicate, which
distributes ``The Boondocks,'' says: ``The increased awareness can
only help newspapers increase the number of people who pick up the
papers.''
</P>
<P>
   McGruder is keeping his cool amid all the attention.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, he was featured in Time and Newsweek. Earlier this
week, he was on a C-Span program, where he had phones ringing off
the hook as a result of his latest strip tease that posed the
question of what is offensive.
</P>
<P>
   In the July 4 strip, McGruder took a joking poke at critics who
call his strip racist. He wrote that ``The Boondocks'' was being
replaced by a new strip that readers might find ``more suitable for
the comic pages.''
</P>
<P>
   The mock replacement featured Jar Jar Binks, the alien from
director George Lucas' summer hit ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The
Phantom Menace.'' Lucas' character, which looks like a Rastafarian
version of Joe Camel and speaks with a vaguely Caribbean syntax,
has drawn fire in the media for acting and sounding like a Stepin
Fetchit black caricature.
</P>
<P>
   McGruder left nothing to chance, giving Jar Jar the full
Buckwheat treatment: ``Jar Jar sho' nuff likes to shuffle! Ya see,
chilluns, Jar Jar besa good alien. Hesa no want no trouble. ...
O-TAY!''
</P>
<P>
   Says McGruder, with a chuckle: ``Jar Jar fans are upset? Well,
too bad.''
</P>
<P>
   He does not apologize for stepping on toes to foster intelligent
social and political satire with black themes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do a black strip,'' he recently explained. ``I think white
people who want to buy into black culture would rather buy into
something that's authentic rather than something that is watered
down for their sake.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking this week from his hotel room in Seattle, where he is
attending the UNITY '99 conference for minority journalists, he
said he has much on his plate.
</P>
<P>
   After his picture appeared in national magazines, he was
approached by a ``major'' network to act in an upcoming TV pilot.
(He's weighing the offer.) He already has an animated version of
``The Boondocks'' in the works with movie director Reginald Hudlin.
</P>
<P>
   For now, he's glad to be in Seattle, away from heat _ including
the weather kind. ``He called me as soon as he arrived out there in
Seattle,'' McGruder's mother said from the family home in Maryland,
where there has been a heat wave. ``He said, `Mom, it's so
beautiful out here. It's not so hot.'''

SPORT VEHICLES CAN BE BUILT TO BE SAFER, INSURERS SAY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Sport utility vehicles can be designed both to protect
their occupants and to reduce injuries to the occupants of vehicles
that they hit, an insurance industry group said Wednesday, citing
tests it performed using six mid-size sport utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The two vehicles that did best when rammed into concrete and
steel barriers were also those with features likely to reduce the
injuries of occupants of other vehicles in collisions, the group
said.
</P>
<P>
   Auto makers have long said that this would be a difficult
balance to strike and have been reluctant to make changes that,
they say, might endanger occupants of sport utility vehicles in an
effort to protect occupants of the vehicles involved in accidents
with them.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the companies have criticized the growing
reliance of federal regulators and insurers on high-speed crash
tests into solid barriers. To pass these tests, the auto makers
contend, they must make sport utility vehicles with very stiff
bodies to keep the big vehicles' own weight from crushing the
occupants' compartments during crashes. But as federal regulators
have warned, vehicles with very stiff frames are likely to pierce
deeply into other vehicles during collisions.
</P>
<P>
   The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a research group
seeking to reduce the cost of accident claims, said Wednesday that
it was possible to build safe sport utility vehicles with less
rigid front ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would appear that there should be no conflicts between
doing well in this kind of test and being more compatible with
cars,'' said Brian O'Neill, the president of the institute, which
is based in Arlington, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The institute tested the Mercedes M-Class, Lexus RX 300, Land
Rover Discovery Series II, Dodge Durango, Jeep Grand Cherokee and
Mitsubishi Montero Sport. Each vehicle was crashed into a barrier
at 40 mph, with the front corner on the driver's side hitting
first.
</P>
<P>
   The two vehicles that fared best, the Mercedes and the Lexus,
had relatively soft front ends that were designed to bend and
absorb energy during a crash, O'Neill said. Rather than having
stiff bodies like most other vehicles tested, both vehicles have
stiff materials only around the passenger compartment.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes has promoted its sport utility vehicle as the first
designed to minimize injuries to other motorists. O'Neill said that
while his institute had not evaluated the performance of the
Mercedes and Lexus in crashes with cars, both had designs
consistent with reducing injuries to occupants of other vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers had a mixed reaction to Wednesday's test results. The
Chrysler Corp. had been a strong defender of stiff sport utility
vehicles, but that position has shifted since Daimler-Benz A.G.,
which makes Mercedes vehicles, took it over last November.
</P>
<P>
   Sonja L. Bultynck, a spokeswoman for DaimlerChrysler A.G., which
makes the Mercedes, Dodge and Jeep vehicles tested, said that the
company considered the stiffness of each vehicle separately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being the global transportation company that we are, we're
going to look at each case,'' Mrs. Bultynck said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodge Durango, a stiff vehicle, received a rating of
``acceptable'' instead of the ``good'' given to the Mercedes and
Lexus vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bultynck said, ``We're going to build the Durango to have a
rigid body because it's going to be towing all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Discovery Series II was rated ``acceptable,'' and the Grand
Cherokee was deemed ``marginal.'' The Montero Sport was rated
``poor'' because it allowed considerable collapse of the occupants'
compartment, which could lead to more injuries. Its manufacturer,
Mitsubishi, said the Montero Sport had met or exceeded all federal
safety standards.
</P>
<P>
   The General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler discussed
plans last year to file a petition with federal regulators asking
that crash tests be conducted at lower speeds for large sport
utility vehicles and pickup trucks so the vehicles could be made
less stiff and therefore less dangerous to other motorists. After
the Chrysler take-over, the drafting of a petition was put on hold
until later this year.
</P>
<P>
   A study released by federal regulators in March estimated that
an extra 2,000 Americans are killed each year in vehicles hit by
sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and mini-vans.
</P>
<P>
   Ford officials have suggested that only half as many lives are
lost in such crashes and have said that some vehicle mismatches are
inevitable in crashes.

BUSH SAYS `NEW COMMANDER IN CHIEF ON THE WAY' &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By JULIE MASON
 &HT;    c. 1999 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush took steps Wednesday
to quell questions about his military service by meeting with a
heroic Air Force pilot and declaring, ``There's a new commander in
chief on the way.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, which was not on the Republican front-runner's
schedule, came as Bush met with officials from seven Western states
in the home of the newest GOP presidential candidate, Sen. Orrin
Hatch of Utah.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, Scott O'Grady, ejected from his F-16 after a Serb
missile hit the fighter while he was patrolling over northwestern
Bosnia four years ago. He spent six days hiding from Serb forces
before a dramatic rescue by U.S. forces.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's own warrior credentials were called into question over
the Fourth of July weekend with reports that he may have received
preferential treatment in the Texas Air National Guard during the
Vietnam War. His record, and that of many of his rivals who also
sat out combat in Vietnam, contrasts with that of candidate John
McCain, the Arizona senator and combat veteran who spent five years
as a prisoner of the Viet Cong.
</P>
<P>
   Besides asking O'Grady to spread the word that ``there's a new
commander in chief on the way,'' Bush also promised ``a season of
hope after years of cynicism'' and vowed to restore ``dignity and
honor'' to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   He also questioned the Clinton administration's taking credit
for the economic boom of the 1990s, tweaking Vice President Al
Gore, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination,
in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you listen to those back there in Washington, D.C., they
sound like they created prosperity,'' Bush said. ``They no more
created prosperity than they invented the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Bush were the governors of Wyoming, Nevada, Idaho,
Colorado and Montana as well as Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt. Also
present were Sen. Gordon Smith of Oregon and state and local
officials from Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Although he supports Bush, Leavitt is not technically endorsing
Bush for president.
</P>
<P>
   For Leavitt, there is the thorny problem of Hatch, who is making
a late addition to the crowded field of Republican presidential
candidates. Leavitt plans to support both campaigns, and has so far
maintained a posture of amiable fence-sitting.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, who has yet to formally announce his intentions, knows he
is a long shot and has presented himself as a ``credible
alternative'' should Bush falter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe it's not good for the Republican Party to
have a juggernaut, especially when nobody really knows what all the
leading candidate stands for,'' Hatch told the Toledo Blade this
week. ``He does appear to be very good. And certainly if he wins,
I'll be his strongest supporter. But on the other hand, that
doesn't mean we should just hand it to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also campaigned in Portland, Ore., visiting a Boys and
Girls Club and attending an evening reception.
</P>
<P>
   Bush continues his Western swing Thursday with stops in Spokane,
Seattle and Bellevue, Wash. Nevertheless, his staff told a
gathering of minority journalists convening in Seattle this week
that he would not have time to speak to them. All presidential
candidates were invited, but only Democrats Gore and Bill Bradley
accepted.

MASSACHUSETTS GOVERNOR JOINS EFFORT ON DRUG INSURANCE FOR ELDERLY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Del., Ill., Maine, Md., Mich., Minn., N.J., N.Y.,
Pa., R.I., Vt., Wyo.)  (mk) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It may be the hot political issue of the moment in
Washington, but from here, the federal government's rising debate
over coverage of prescription drugs for the elderly looks a bit
late, a bit leisurely.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Legislature, dominated by Democrats, has been
grappling with the issue for months, and this week Gov. Paul
Cellucci, a Republican, jumped in with his own plan for a state-run
insurance program that would offer a form of drug coverage to all
the state's elderly citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't feel that we can wait for federal action,'' said
state Rep. Harriette Chandler, the House chairwoman of the
Legislature's Joint Committee on Health Care. ``We have seniors who
are in all forms of real crisis at this point. We have people who
are cutting their prescriptions in half, we have people skipping
days and people who haven't been filling prescriptions. They really
do exist.''
</P>
<P>
   The urgency has grown out of unusual circumstance: Massachusetts
had been the only state to require health maintenance organizations
to offer elderly members the option of full prescription drug
coverage. But that law was overturned in federal court, and though
the state's HMOs have been slowly phasing out the drug coverage,
thousands of members already face problems paying for their
medications.
</P>
<P>
   But Massachusetts is not the only state that has long been
pursuing a solution to such drug costs. In recent years, 13 other
states have passed various programs to help the elderly pay for
prescription drugs, mainly focused on low-income people who do not
qualify for Medicaid. Those states are Connecticut, Delaware,
Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New
York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   And in recent months, more than half the state legislatures have
examined bills on the issue, according to the National Conference
of State Legislatures. In several states proposals have passed at
least one chamber. Proposals have ranged from drug discounts to
adding people to state-subsidized programs.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, one lawmaker proposed a bill, now in
committee, that would empower the state to negotiate with drug
manufacturers for discounts on medications for all its citizens,
not only the elderly; another proposal would let all elderly people
receive the same group rate for their medications as state
employees receive under their insurance plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about things we never thought we'd be talking
about,'' Ms. Chandler said, but ``prescription drugs have increased
15 to 20 percent a year, and that kind of spiral you can't afford
to continue in for very long.''
</P>
<P>
   All the talking crystallized here into two main proposals, one
by the House of Representatives and one by the Senate. The two
plans differed in dollar amounts and various provisions, though
both would expand the pool of elderly eligible for state aid in
buying their prescriptions as well as the amount of aid they could
receive. Both also called for using a small amount of the billions
of dollars that Massachusetts expects to receive from tobacco
companies in the settlement of suits to recover money spent on
smoke-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   When Cellucci announced his own plan on Tuesday, he called it a
compromise between the House and Senate versions. In fact, however,
analysts say it is a whole different entity, though it would use
some of the tobacco money, because it entails not merely state
subsidies but also a state-run insurance program that any elderly
person could join.
</P>
<P>
   For a premium of about $54 a month _ less or nothing for the
poor _ enrollees would get unlimited coverage for prescription
drugs, though with co-payments, and after paying a deductible of
$750 a year for the elderly whose income is 150 percent of the
federal poverty level to $1,500 for those better off. The proposed
co-payments would range from $8 to $35, depending on the type of
drugs. The enrollees would also receive an estimated 22 percent
discount on all drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would begin in January and last either two years or
until the federal government enacted its own drug coverage plan,
whichever came first.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize there's a crisis and we're willing to step up to
the plate,'' said state Sen. Richard Moore, the Senate chairman of
the joint committee. Cellucci's plan appears to be generally
drawing high marks, but not everywhere. Alan Sager, a Boston
University health care economist, said Wednesday that making such a
drug-coverage plan voluntary, as both Cellucci's and President
Clinton's proposals would, amounted to a financial ``death
sentence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You get into adverse selection,'' Sager said, ``because
prescription drugs are the single most predictable expense in
health care.'' Thus, the sickest people are likely to enroll, he
said, and the healthier people needed to make the plan financially
viable are not.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers also raised objections, including that it did not
provide enough help for the disabled and moderately poor elderly.
Questions also remain about whether the incentives it provides
younger, healthier elderly people to sign up, like a planned 10
percent discount on their monthly premium, will be enough.
</P>
<P>
   But overall, said Geoff Wilkinson, executive director of the
Massachusetts Senior Action Council, which has staged two
drug-coverage rallies at the Statehouse here in recent months,
``There's a lot to like about the governor's plan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress would do well to take a look at what's going on
here,'' Wilkinson said.

ADVERTISING: GREY OPENS STAND-ALONE UNIT TO PURSUE GENERATION Y 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seeking to bolster its presence in a market segment that is
growing faster than the number of Web sites devoted to Britney
Spears, ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' the Backstreet Boys or
``American Pie,'' Grey Advertising Inc. has opened a stand-alone
agency devoted to the very consumers who would consider such sites
to be ``all that'': youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   G Whiz is the name of the new unit, which is operating as a
wholly owned subsidiary of Grey, the world's No. 9 agency company,
with billings estimated at $8.3 billion, from clients like Hasbro,
Mars, Procter &AMP; Gamble and Sprint. To underline the intended
autonomy of G Whiz, the agency's dozen employees are working at an
office in midtown Manhattan that is separate from the Grey
headquarters office nearby.
</P>
<P>
   G Whiz has started with accounts, assignments and projects with
billings estimated at $20 million for brands like Elmer's glue,
Konami video games, Reebok footwear and Warner Brothers videos. All
are centered on the youth market, aiming at the demographic group
called Generation Y whose members were born between 1978 and 1998
and spend an estimated $130 billion annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are now adopting brands at a very young age, making
brands their `badges,''' said G Whiz president Barbara Martino.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just about knowing what's hot and what's not,'' she
added. ``It's about understanding the emotions that drive the
behavior that interconnects with brands.''
</P>
<P>
   The new unit is a successor to 18 and Under, which had been part
of the Grey advertising operations. The goal now is to offer
marketers who are pitching products and services to children and
teen-agers a range of so-called integrated communications that
include interactive marketing, research, promotional marketing,
brand planning and event marketing in addition to traditional
selling tactics like television commercials and print
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Grey employees are being ``encouraged to anticipate the
marketing landscape and move beyond classical advertising,'' said
Grey chairman and chief executive Edward Meyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now 40 percent of our global volume comes from diversified
communications,'' he added. ``Our holdings in interactive and
e-commerce, media services including online media, health care,
multicultural marketing and brand asset consulting are our
fastest-growing units.''
</P>
<P>
   G Whiz joins a lengthening list of agencies that are
specializing in youth marketing as the large agency companies seek
to diversify by bolstering units in hot submarkets or niche
categories like new media and media services.
</P>
<P>
   Other examples include CME Kidcom, part of Campbell Mithun Esty
in Minneapolis, which is majority owned by Interpublic Group of
Cos.; Geppetto Group in New York, owned by WPP Group PLC; Kid Leo,
part of the Leo Burnett Company in Chicago, and Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi
Kid Connection, part of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi PLC.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to put more muscle behind our youth-market
efforts,'' Ms. Martino said, ``because there's a lot of opportunity
there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At 18 and Under, we were doing business while also doing our
day jobs,'' she added. ``Now we have a dedicated group devoted to
the youth marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Martino, 37, joined Grey in 1990, then helped start 18 and
Under in 1992 and Indigo Entertainment in 1994, a Grey unit
specializing in the production of TV shows for children.
</P>
<P>
   Other G Whiz executives include Brett Howlett, 39, the vice
president and creative director, and Douglas Zarkin, 29, the vice
president who manages branding efforts for clients.
</P>
<P>
   G Whiz is also indicative of Grey's efforts to freshen and
contemporize its image, often described as stodgy and traditional,
as competition intensifies among the giant agencies. A stand-alone
unit dedicated to working on youthful communications campaigns can
help ``youthify'' the Grey brand.
</P>
<P>
   One suggestion: do something about that name. G Whiz is more
evocative of the America depicted in ``The Music Man'' _ remember
when Harold Hill sang about a publication called ``Captain Billy's
Whiz Bang''? _ than of the nation whose young people will spend
most of their lives in the 21st century.

BOEING PICKS G.E. ENGINES FOR LONGER-RANGE VERSIONS OF 777 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Although it is still talking with potential customers
and has not decided when to officially launch the 777X, The Boeing
Co. has picked General Electric to develop the huge engines the new
plane will require.
</P>
<P>
   GE, the world's largest engine maker, said Wednesday the deal
with Boeing could be worth as much as $25 billion over 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the most significant wins for GE Aircraft
Engines in its long history,'' James McNerney, president of GE
Aircraft Engines, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Rolls-Royce and Pratt &AMP; Whitney also submitted bids to develop
the engines.
</P>
<P>
   But Boeing selected GE as the exclusive supplier of the
115,000-pound-thrust engines that will power the 777X. The engine
will be a derivative of the GE90, developed in the mid 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   At the Paris Air Show last month, McNerney told reporters GE
wanted an exclusive deal with Boeing to justify the development
cost of the new engines. He said the market for the 777X was not
big enough to support more than one engine maker.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines have a choice of engines that power the 777-200 and the
stretch 777-300. Rolls-Royce, GE and Pratt &AMP; Whitney all supply
engines for the current fleet of 777s.
</P>
<P>
   The potential market for the 777X is probably about 500 planes,
according to Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Wednesday, Alan Mulally, Boeing Commercial
Airplanes president, said all three engine makers submitted good
proposals for the 777X.
</P>
<P>
   But GE, he said, ``best met the overall evaluation criteria,
including technical, schedule, customer service and business
requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   Mulally was the 777 program manager during the development of
the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing executives have not said when they will launch the
longer-range versions of the 777.
</P>
<P>
   There has been much industry speculation that a decision will be
made before the end of this year, but in an interview last month at
the Paris Air Show, Mulally said he doesn't know when the green
light will be given for development of either the 777-200X, the
777-300X or both.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have an airplane like this, when you start depends on
when you need to deliver it. We will keep talking (to potential
customers),'' Mulally said.
</P>
<P>
   In its news release Wednesday, GE quoted Boeing as saying it
wants to begin delivering the 777X to customers by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Two versions of the 777X are planned.
</P>
<P>
   The 777-200X would carry about 300 passengers in a three-class
configuration, which is the same size as the current 777-200. But
the new plane would have a range of about 10,100 miles, or about
1,200 miles farther than the current 777-200ER (extended range).
</P>
<P>
   The 777-300X would carry about 360 passengers, the same as the
777-300. But it will fly 8,300 miles, some 1,800 miles farther than
the 777-300.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing believes many airlines will choose the 777-300X as a
replacement for older 747s and DC-11s.
</P>
<P>
   The 777X will have a strengthened fuselage, tail and landing
gear and a new wing tip with 76 inches of added span on each side.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing is bullish on the 777X because of market fragmentation.
That's the industry term for more frequent flights and more flights
directly from one point to another, instead of big planes that fly
to hub airports.
</P>
<P>
   The new versions of the 777 would challenge the Airbus A340-500
and A340-600 now in development. But the Boeing planes would fly
farther.

ECONOMIC SCENE: IF DOCTORS WIN RIGHT TO ORGANIZE, PATIENTS COULD
LOSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A closely divided American Medical Association, which represents
about a third of the nation's physicians, has voted to form a union
to represent its members in collective bargaining with health
plans, hospitals and universities. The rise of managed care has
shaken the cozy world of these high-paid, elite professionals. Now
they are seeking cover from two groups they used to shun: unions
and the Democratic Party, which is leading the charge in Congress
to clamp down on corporate managed care.
</P>
<P>
   But would unionization, as advanced by the AMA, be good for
patients? No, say antitrust officials in the Clinton administration
and many independent economists.
</P>
<P>
   Under current labor law, only salaried doctors can unionize.
About 40,000 of these salaried physicians are already unionized.
For the AMA to begin an aggressive unionization drive among
salaried doctors breaks no new ground.
</P>
<P>
   But the AMA also has something novel in mind. It plans to put
its well-financed lobbying power behind a bill, sponsored by Rep.
Tom Campbell, R-Calif., and about 130 other members of the House,
to change the nation's labor laws so that even independent doctors
could join forces to negotiate fees and working conditions with
health plans.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, a former professor of antitrust law at Stanford
University, says his legislation responds to two ``alarming
anticonsumer trends _ the increased level of concentration among
health insurers and the exclusionary contracting practices some
have followed.''
</P>
<P>
   Large health plans make local physicians a take-it-or-leave-it
offer, dictating their pay and the way they are allowed to practice
medicine. Campbell wants to offset the power of the plans by
creating a countervailing power: a physicians union. A strong
union, he says, would give doctors more power to protect patients
from denials of care by managed-care officials.
</P>
<P>
   But Martin Gaynor, an economics professor at Carnegie Mellon
University in Pittsburgh, says a union of independent physicians
would be unwise. Under the Campbell bill, physicians would be
allowed to fix prices and engage in other anticompetitive
activities that would be illegal elsewhere in the economy. ``A
physicians' union will drive up health care costs, taking money
from workers and putting it in the wallets of doctors,'' he says.
Economists also worry that unionization of independent physicians
will do something worse: severely limit the ability of managed-care
plans to second-guess doctors who practice bad medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Gaynor disputes Campbell's contention that creating a cartel of
independent physicians would help patients even if, as Campbell
assumes, managed-care plans wield monopoly power. But the fact is,
he says, managed-care plans do not exert excessive market power.
``For almost every major urban area in the United States, no HMO
accounts for more than 20 percent of the market'' Gaynor said.
``Many account for less than 10 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   He points out that there are no large profits that a physicians'
union could strip from health plans without affecting patients.
``Profit margins of typical managed-care plans were below 1 percent
in 1995 and negative since then,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a doctors' union jacks up fees,'' Gaynor continued, ``it
will force employers to pass along the added cost to workers as
lower wages.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pitofsky, chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, fears
a union of independent physicians will harm patients by giving
doctors power to refuse to deal with managed care. That, he says,
will drive out competition and drive up costs.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he says, the antitrust exemption Campbell and the AMA
seek is unnecessary. Antitrust guidelines, which he administers,
already allow independent physicians to collaborate to help
patients. They can join forces to discuss raising standards of care
or to form networks that improve care by coordinating treatment.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of the debate is patient care. After an exhaustive
review of the research, Robert Brook, a professor of medicine at
the University of California at Los Angeles, concludes that about a
third of acute care provided by physicians was wrong or
unnecessary, posing not only needless expense but also needless
risk.
</P>
<P>
   Managed care is a possible cure because physicians hired by the
managed-care companies to review treatment by practicing physicians
can correct errors, including rejecting inappropriate tests,
treatments and surgeries. Campbell's bill allows doctors in a
region to band together to block treatment review.
</P>
<P>
   Gaynor acknowledges that there are problems with managed-care
plans. Their quality is uneven, and their decisions can be craven.
But, he says, ``injecting a cartel of otherwise independent doctors
is not the answer.''
</P>
<P>
   So what is? He suggests vigorous enforcement of antitrust rules
against excessive mergers of health plans and carefully drafted
patient-protection laws.

MORE SOAP THAN LAUNDRY DETECTED IN DISNEY'S CASE
</HEADLINE>
 (With DISNEY-KATZENBERG) 
 (nk) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The trial of Jeffrey Katzenberg's suit against the
Walt Disney Co. was eagerly anticipated by Hollywood-watchers for
the look it would provide into the sometimes secretive operations
of the Magic Kingdom. Hollywood executives and Wall Street analysts
were astounded that Disney would even let the case go to trial,
thereby allowing the company's dirty laundry to be aired in public.
</P>
<P>
   But now that the case has been settled, analysts and executives
say there was not that much laundry after all. While the chairman
of Disney, Michael D. Eisner, suffered a bruised reputation, most
of Disney's business secrets stayed intact, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't seem as if there were really any groundbreaking
revelations that came out of it,'' said Stewart Halpern, an analyst
at ING Barings in New York. ``The headlines are a lot sexier than
the realities.''
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg sued seeking a bonus based on the profits of the
movies and television shows that were made during the decade he was
head of Disney's studio. Terms of the settlement were not
announced, but it is believed that Katzenberg could eventually
receive at least $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   Disney had tried to keep the proceedings secret, arguing that a
trial would disclose ``extraordinarily sensitive and confidential''
information about its business and game plans. But a California
judge, in response to a suit filed by several news organizations,
ruled that the trial should be open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Most of what was embarrassing to Disney, though, was not
financial information but personal animosity _ including testimony
disclosing that Eisner had called Katzenberg a ``little midget.''
Wednesday, a Disney spokesman, John Dreyer, said the company did
not think any significant new information about its business was
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent this could be because Disney settled in the nick
of time, before its own witnesses, including Eisner, were to
testify about the company's future business prospects. Until now,
Disney's statements at the trial had mostly been aimed at deflating
projections made by Katzenberg's witnesses. The settlement also
avoids a phase of the trial that would have looked more closely at
Disney's accounting.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there were some nuggets that will no doubt supply grist
for one or more books about Disney and for investors. In
particular, Disney's own trial statements cast doubt about the
company's ability to continue earning money from its classic
full-length animated films, properties once viewed as perennial
money-earners that merely had to await a new generation of children
to enjoy them.
</P>
<P>
   Disney disclosed during the trial, for instance, that it would
no longer re-release its animated movies to theaters because it no
longer made money from doing so. It also said that it was
lengthening to 10 years from 7 years the interval before it
released those movies to the home video market. And the company
said that DVD, or digital video disk, would only replace
videocassettes and not constitute a big new market.
</P>
<P>
   The company also painted dim prospects for business in China and
India, two markets that some analysts said the company had been
counting on for growth. Disney said that partly because of piracy,
it had not made money on a movie, even the China-theme ``Mulan,''
in either of those markets.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said that Disney's trial disclosures contradicted
the rosier projections of its growth prospects it had been telling
investors. ``They were telling us in April of 1998 that the
home-video business was terrific,'' said Jeffrey B. Logsdon,
managing director at the Seidler Companies in Los Angeles,
referring to an analysts' meeting at that time. ``In the meantime,
the home video business has slowed down dramatically for them, both
domestically and internationally.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dreyer, the Disney spokesman, and other analysts said that
some information about the deterioration of the video business had
been disclosed in more recent quarterly earnings statements. Many
analysts also said Disney was deliberately playing down its
prospects at the trial to reduce the amount it would have to pay
Katzenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg's side contended that Disney was licensing films to
ABC, the network it owns, for less than the market price, a move
that would increase the financial results of ABC but would lower
Katzenberg's bonus. According to one document that Disney tried to
keep secret, ABC had offered to pay $6 million for rights to
broadcast ``Hercules'' and ``The Hunchback of Notre Dame'' but a
Disney executive then offered to sell for only $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce O'Donnell, the attorney who represented news
organizations in their effort to open the trial to the public, said
that other evidence introduced at the trial would provide
ammunition for other people who share profits on Disney films and
might want to sue, contending that they are being shortchanged by
Disney accounting practices. O'Donnell represented Art Buchwald
when he sued Paramount Pictures contending that he had been denied
his share of profits from the hit movie ``Coming to America.'' That
trial, which took place in the early 1990s, is considered by some
analysts to be a bigger eye-opener about Hollywood's business
practices than the Katzenberg trial.
</P>
<P>
   To many analysts, what was most revealing about Disney from the
Katzenberg case was that Eisner let it get to trial, distracting
him at a time when the company is battling declining profits.
Questions were raised about whether Eisner was letting his ego and
animosity for Katzenberg get in the way of his business judgment.
But Dreyer said Disney had an obligation to shareholders to avoid
paying the huge sum _ $250 million or more _ that Katzenberg was
demanding.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's stock price has been falling in the last two months,
but analysts say that is mainly because of Disney's declining
profits, not because of the trial. Wednesday, Disney's shares moved
up only 12.5 cents, to $28.0625, on news of the settlement. ``It's
a positive from a psychological standpoint for the stock,'' said
Katherine Styponias, an analyst with Prudential Securities.

FULL RECOVERY EXPECTED FOR REP. JIM MCDERMOTT AFTER HEART SURGERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Jim McDermott had major open-heart surgery
Wednesday to repair a congenital flaw in a heart valve.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Democrat was awake, breathing on his own and in
stable condition in the intensive care unit in Swedish Medical
Center in Seattle after three hours of surgery. His aides said the
congressman is expected to make a full recovery after spending
about a week at the hospital, at least two more weeks at home, and
then several more weeks avoiding strenuous activity.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott, 62, is a psychiatrist and former state lawmaker who
was elected to Congress in 1988. He represents most of the city of
Seattle, as well as Vashon Island and parts of Lake Forest Park,
Renton and Shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott is mulling over a race for the U.S. Senate next year,
and aides said Wednesday's surgery would not affect his decision.
McDermott had hoped to make an announcement in August.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott, a longtime crusader for medical privacy, asked his
staff not to discuss his surgery until after he regained
consciousness, and he declined to permit his surgeon, Dr. Edward
Rittenhouse, to speak with the news media. His press secretary,
David Schaefer, described the congressman's condition and
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   According to Schaefer, McDermott has known for years that he had
a congenital heart condition called aortic stenosis, a malformation
of the valve on the left ventricle. The left ventricle is one of
the four chambers of the heart, and is the main source of blood to
the aorta, which in turn distributes blood to the brain and other
parts of the body.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, while performing an annual physical exam on
McDermott, a physician found through an electrocardiogram that
McDermott's malformed valve had begun to calcify, a condition that
can lead to heart failure. The physician recommended
valve-replacement surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The faulty valve was removed and a mechanical valve was
installed in its place in Wednesday's surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer said there were no complications and that the surgery
was successful. He said McDermott hopes to be back in Congress by
the first week of August, when the House expects to be casting its
final votes on some spending measures before recessing until after
Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   Two cardiac surgeons interviewed Wednesday said patients who
undergo valve-replacement surgery can expect to spend from one to
three months in recovery because the breastbone, or sternum, is
broken during the surgery. They said patients who have mechanical
valves installed must take blood thinners for the rest of their
lives or risk having a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aortic stenosis is a common cardiac condition that we see
regularly, and valve replacement is the standard treatment,'' said
Dr. Frances DeRook, a cardiologist at Harborview Medical Center in
Seattle. ``The prognosis, with treatment, is very good. Life
expectancy is near normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Edward Verrier, chief of cardiothoracic surgery at the
University of Washington Medical Center, also in Seattle, agreed
that aortic stenosis is ``one of the most common congenital
anomalies'' and that valve replacement is ``a relatively routine
operation.''

the new plane would have a range of about 10,100 miles, or about
1,200 miles farther than the current 777-200ER (extended range).
</P>
<P>
   The 777-300X would carry about 360 passengers, the same as the
777-300. But it will fly 8,300 miles, some 1,800 miles farther than
the 777-300.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing believes many airlines will choose the 777-300X as a
replacement for older 747s and DC-11s.
</P>
<P>
   The 777X will have a strengthened fuselage, tail and landing
gear and a new wing tip with 76 inches of added span on each side.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing is bullish on the 777X because of market fragmentation.
That's the industry term for more frequent flights and more flights
directly from one point to another, instead of big planes that fly
to hub airports.
</P>
<P>
   The new versions of the 777 would challenge the Airbus A340-500
and A340-600 now in development. But the Boeing planes would fly
farther.

   JERUSALEM _ Moving swiftly to make good on his pledges to
restart the stalled Middle East peace effort, Ehud Barak announced
as he moved into the prime minister's office Wednesday that he
would hold a series of meetings with Arab leaders and President
Clinton in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   Barak plans to meet with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt on
Friday in Alexandria and with Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian
leader, on Sunday at the Erez Crossing between the Gaza Strip and
Israel, a statement from his office said.
</P>
<P>
   A meeting is also planned with King Abdullah of Jordan before
Barak travels to the United States next week for discussions with
Clinton and senior administration officials, the statement added.
Barak is expected in Washington on July 15.
</P>
<P>
   The whirl of diplomacy is intended to explore ways to revive
aborted peace talks with Syria and to move peace efforts forward
with the Palestinians. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is
expected to visit the Middle East to follow up the discussions
after Barak returns from Washington, Israeli officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The new Israeli prime minister is seeking help from the Clinton
administration and from the leaders of Egypt and Jordan, which are
at peace with Israel, to renew negotiations with Syria that were
broken off more than three years ago. &UR;  &LR; Presi- dent Hafez Assad of
Syria, which technically remains in a state of war with Israel, has
said he would not meet an Israeli leader until peace negotiations
were concluded.
 &UR;  &LR; ``These meetings symbolize Barak's determination to resume the
peace process and renew the relations of trust between the new
Israeli government and Arab leaders,'' said Haim Ramon, a Cabinet
minister who is responsible for Jerusalem issues.
</P>
<P>
   In his inauguration speech Tuesday, Barak pledged to make the
pursuit of peace with the Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon the
``supreme goal'' of his government.
</P>
<P>
   Nabil Shaath, a senior aide to Arafat, welcomed Barak's
announcement of the first meeting between Arafat and an Israeli
leader since last December.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Arafat is quite encouraged by this,'' Shaath said.
``We hope our first meeting will be successful and usher in a new
period of relations and partnership between the two leaders, if it
is followed by some practical things on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   In Damascus, a statement read on state television said: ``Syria
shares with Prime Minister Barak the same wish to put an end to
wars and establish comprehensive peace in the region. The Syrian
government is ready to match every step with a similar one and to
resume peace talks from the point where they ended as soon as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   At a handover ceremony in the prime minister's office where he
was welcomed by his predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu, Barak said,
``There is tremendous expectation that we will know, from this room
and from this building, how to navigate the state of Israel and the
entire region to security and peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Israeli commentators suggested that Barak was moving
quickly to carry out his peace promises in order to pre-empt
possible resistance from right-leaning members of his broad
governing coalition, which spans 75 members of the 120-member
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Little is known yet about how Barak intends to go about
restoring momentum to negotiations with the Palestinians, which
bogged down in distrust and recrimination during Netanyahu's term
as prime minister. At Wednesday's hand-over ceremony, Barak said
that he would try to avoid Netanyahu's mistakes, but did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Netanyahu suspended the latest Israeli-Palestinian
accord, the Wye River agreement signed near Washington last
October, accusing the Palestinians of failing to keep their part of
the deal. The agreement called for a phased Israeli withdrawal from
parts of the West Bank in exchange for Palestinian security
measures.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon said Barak would seek changes in the Wye agreement, but
only with Palestinian consent. Israeli press reports said Barak
would prefer to skip further Israeli troop withdrawals and proceed
directly to talks on a permanent peace _ a move that would leave
more land under Israeli control, giving Israel more negotiating
leverage, before the hard bargaining on a final settlement.
</P>
<P>
   However, Shaath predicted Arafat would reject Barak's suggestion
and insist on full adherence to the Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Arafat will politely and firmly tell him no,''
Shaath said. ``If you say you are not willing to implement
agreements that have been signed, how will I trust you to implement
anything in the future? If he says I will go through with it as
soon as possible, that's enough.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Shaath said the Palestinians also expect Barak to halt Israeli
settlement activity in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and
particularly in East Jerusalem. The future of these areas is
supposed to be decided in negotiations on a final peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines of Barak's government say that no new settlements
will be built, but that existing settlements will not be harmed and
their ``development needs'' will be met, a formula that allows for
expansion of these communities.
</P>
<P>
   As for Israeli projects in East Jerusalem, Ramon said Tuesday
that work on a housing complex for Jews in the Arab neighborhood of
Ras al-Amud should be stopped, although he did not announce steps
to do this. And he added that building would proceed at another
disputed site, a hill known in Hebrew as Har Homa and in Arabic as
Jabal Abu Ghneim.
</P>
<P>
   As Barak arrived at the prime minister's office Wednesday, other
members of his Cabinet took the reins of their ministries from
their predecessors in ceremonies whose cordiality contrasted with
the rancor of the election campaign that ended with Barak's
resounding victory on May 17.
</P>
<P>
   Barak set the tone by paying warm compliments to Netanyahu and
raising a glass to the departing prime minister and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``To Benjamin and Sara Netanyahu and to the state of Israel,''
Barak said. ``To life, l'chayim!''

JACKSON CALLS IN HIS TROOPS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Phil Jackson's drive to reassemble his inner circle
from Chicago has received two boosts and one setback.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers new coach named former Bulls assistant Jim Cleamons
to his staff Wednesday. The Lakers also hired Bulls trainer Chip
Schaefer at Jackson's request.
</P>
<P>
   But another former Bulls assistant, Jimmy Rodgers, has decided
not to rejoin Jackson, leaving two vacancies on his staff.
</P>
<P>
   Cleamons has not signed a contract but agreed to a deal in
principle Monday and was in Long Beach by Wednesday morning to help
coach the Lakers' summer-league team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy Jim Cleamons is here. We've been together for six
years in the Bulls' organization,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Cleamons' familiarity with Jackson's system, including the
triangle offense, will be a notable asset. But Jackson said he
brings much more to the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim and I have a really good working relationship. He's a
quality guy that really knows this game and really cares about this
game, the people that are in it, and he's a very good teacher,''
Jackson said. ``He's a a really good practice coach, a guy you can
really trust young players to.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleamons is heading up the coaching staff of the summer-league
team, assisted by holdover Lakers assistants Bill Bertka and Larry
Drew. Jackson hopes to name his other two assistants next week, and
longtime Bulls coach and triangle guru Tex Winter remains a
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers, a member of Jackson's Bulls staff for four years,
declined an offer to join the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just made a decision that for his own personal reasons; at
this time he couldn't see himself taking this job,'' said Jackson,
who continues to search for other ex-Bulls to fill out his staff.
``What I need as staff is people who are totally familiar with what
I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleamons said the choice to rejoin Jackson didn't take much
debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a wonderful opportunity for me to work with Phil
again,'' he said. ``It was almost, I don't want to say `a
no-brainer,' but the fact remains it was too good of an opportunity
to pass up.''
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer, the Bulls trainer for the last nine years, will work
in tandem with longtime Lakers trainer Gary Vitti and strength
coach Jim Cotta. Schaefer was the Lakers strength coach in 1986-87
and also worked as head trainer at Loyola Marymount for four years.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Pyramid: The Lakers' summer pro-league team opens play
Friday night at the Pyramid at Cal State Long Beach. Tipoff is 7:30
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Playing for the Lakers will be this year's draftees, Devean
George and John Celestand, last year's rookies, Tyronn Lue, Sam
Jacobson and free-agent Ruben Patterson, and three-year veteran
Travis Knight.
</P>
<P>
   They are joined by free agents Taymon Domzalski (Duke, '99),
Ruben Garces (Providence, '97), Andy Panko (Lebanon Valley, Pa.,
'99), Seth Sundberg (Hawaii, '97), M.C. Mazique (Alabama '99) and
Donald Williams (North Carolina '95).
</P>
<P>
   Back for more: Lakers' broadcasting legend Chick Hearn signed a
new two-year contract Wednesday. The 82-year-old Hearn has called
3,114 consecutive Lakers games, dating back to 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Denials: Both the Lakers and a spokesman for Charles Oakley are
refuting a report that the Toronto Raptors forward has agreed to a
deal with L.A. Oakley, a free agent, continues to mull all of his
options, said financial adviser Billy Diamond. He called the ESPN
report ``not only premature, but ridiculous.''

 &HT;    BUSH SAYS `NEW COMMANDER IN CHIEF ON THE WAY'
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 1st Ld-Writethru _ changes in 2nd and 3rd grafs  &HT;    By JULIE MASON
 &HT;    c. 1999 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush took steps Wednesday
to quell questions about his military service by meeting with a
heroic Air Force pilot and declaring, ``There's a new commander in
chief on the way.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting with Scott O'Grady, who was shot down over Bosnia in
1995, was not on the Republican front-runner's schedule and came as
Bush met with officials from seven Western states in the home of
the newest GOP presidential candidate, Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah.
</P>
<P>
   O'Grady ejected after a Serb missile hit his F-16 while he was
patrolling over northwestern Bosnia. He spent six days hiding from
Serb forces before a dramatic rescue by U.S. forces.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's own warrior credentials were called into question over
the Fourth of July weekend with reports that he may have received
preferential treatment in the Texas Air National Guard during the
Vietnam War. His record, and that of many of his rivals who also
sat out combat in Vietnam, contrasts with that of candidate John
McCain, the Arizona senator and combat veteran who spent five years
as a prisoner of the Viet Cong.
</P>
<P>
   Besides asking O'Grady to spread the word that ``there's a new
commander in chief on the way,'' Bush promised ``a season of hope
after years of cynicism'' and vowed to restore ``dignity and
honor'' to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   He also questioned the Clinton administration's taking credit
for the economic boom of the 1990s, tweaking Vice President Al
Gore, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination,
in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you listen to those back there in Washington, D.C., they
sound like they created prosperity,'' Bush said. ``They no more
created prosperity than they invented the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Bush were the governors of Wyoming, Nevada, Idaho,
Colorado and Montana as well as Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt. Also
present were Sen. Gordon Smith of Oregon and state and local
officials from Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Although he supports Bush, Leavitt is not technically endorsing
Bush for president.
</P>
<P>
   For Leavitt, there is the thorny problem of Hatch, who is making
a late addition to the crowded field of Republican presidential
candidates. Leavitt plans to support both campaigns, and has so far
maintained a posture of amiable fence-sitting.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, who has yet to formally announce his intentions, knows he
is a long shot and has presented himself as a ``credible
alternative'' should Bush falter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe it's not good for the Republican Party to
have a juggernaut, especially when nobody really knows what all the
leading candidate stands for,'' Hatch told the Toledo Blade this
week. ``He does appear to be very good. And certainly if he wins,
I'll be his strongest supporter. But on the other hand, that
doesn't mean we should just hand it to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also campaigned in Portland, Ore., visiting a Boys and
Girls Club and attending an evening reception.
</P>
<P>
   Bush continues his Western swing Thursday with stops in Spokane,
Seattle and Bellevue, Wash. Nevertheless, his staff told a
gathering of minority journalists convening in Seattle this week
that he would not have time to speak to them. All presidential
candidates were invited, but only Democrats Gore and Bill Bradley
accepted.

IN A FEISTY TAKEOVER BATTLE, THE DEVIL MAY BE IN THE FOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo.)   (bl)  
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the world of mergers and acquisitions, the best negotiations
amount to something of a poker game. Never let your opponent know
what you are thinking. Show your hand only when you must. And
always serve good food.
</P>
<P>
   Such a game is being deftly played by the executives and
advisers involved in what is fast becoming the feistiest takeover
battle in recent years. Three weeks ago, Qwest Communications
International, the telecommunications upstart based in Denver, made
hostile offers for both U S West Corp. and Frontier Corp., two
companies that recently agreed to merge with Global Crossing Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   Teams of bankers, lawyers and corporate executives for both U S
West, the smallest of the regional Bell companies, and Qwest have
been holed up at U S West's headquarters in downtown Denver since
Saturday trying to hammer out an agreement that both companies can
live with. As of Wednesday night, neither company had signed a
confidentiality agreement that would allow an exchange of financial
information, people close to the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   But the discussions continue in earnest, including a
presentation on regulatory issues last Saturday to U S West
executives by Qwest chief executive Joseph Nacchio, said a person
close to the talks. While some people suggest that a decision from
U S West could be reached as early as next week, several issues
have yet to be resolved. One point of contention is the fate of
Solomon Trujillo, the chief executive of U S West.
</P>
<P>
   Trujillo is not interested in a combination with Qwest unless he
can be named co-chief executive and the board be split equally
between Qwest and U S West, people close to the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   Haggling for a spot in the executive suite should not come as a
surprise. Trujillo's role in a combined Global Crossing and U S
West was a major sticking point in those talks last spring. One
person involved in that deal said it was one of the concessions
Global made to get the deal done. But Nacchio has said that he does
not want to share the top spot with Trujillo, and has instead
offered him a vice chairmanship. Trujillo has turned down requests
for interviews.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,800 miles away from Denver in law offices and
investment bank conference rooms on Manhattan's East Side, a small
group of executives from Frontier, a long-distance company, and
their advisers have met with a separate negotiating team for Qwest
regarding those merger talks. On Tuesday, people close to the talks
said, Frontier representatives asked for more clarification on the
bid being offered by Qwest. The two teams met again Wednesday and
began a preliminary exchange of financial data.
</P>
<P>
   The question on the minds of some investors is whether Global
Crossing's founder, Gary Winnick, will step in and raise his
$63-a-share stock offer for Frontier. ``It's hard to imagine at the
end of the day that Frontier will be left with a $63-a-share
deal,'' a person close to the talks said. Qwest's current offer for
Frontier is $68 a share in Qwest stock and cash. But there are
other issues Frontier executives are considering, including when a
transaction is likely to close and what the regulatory hurdles are.
</P>
<P>
   Executives for Global Crossing and Frontier continue to meet
weekly to discuss their deal, which _ if Qwest does not intervene _
is expected to close in the third quarter of this year. And it is
expected that Global chief executive Robert Annunziata will take
Global Crossing's story to investors next week after it files
documents regarding Frontier with regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Winnick and Annunziata have remained silent so far. Global
Crossing has a provision in its merger deal with Frontier that
allows it a ``last look'' at any bid made by Qwest. But some people
close to the talks suggest that Global Crossing would have been
better off to close the Frontier transaction first before agreeing
to merge with U S West.
</P>
<P>
   What is unclear is how well Qwest and U S West are getting along
even in these exploratory talks. One person close to the talks said
U S West executives have chafed at the deluge of letters to
Trujillo that Qwest has issued. Qwest undertook a letter writing
campaign two weeks ago to correct what it considered to be
misleading or inaccurate information, including press accounts. But
U S West told Qwest to ``turn down the heat,'' said the person,
referring to Qwest's letter writing.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing some people commented on was that the meals in
this round of talks are far different from those during the Global
Crossing discussions. One night in Manhattan, U S West executives
had meals delivered from Shun Lee, one of the city's priciest and
best-regarded Chinese restaurants. When Qwest executives went to U
S West's headquarters recently, they brought bagels. ``There are
few good restaurants in Denver,'' one person said, sighing.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: MAKING POLITICAL HAY ON MOYNIHAN'S FARM  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By GAIL COLLINS  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINDARS CORNERS, N.Y. _ Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan's upstate
farm went into full media alert for Hillary Rodham Clinton's visit.
The Moynihan barn was cleaned out to make room for portable toilets
by the senator's chief of staff, who swore he had done it
voluntarily on his day off. The hay was cut, baled and replaced by
a field full of satellite dishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least 60 TV crews!'' cried a man who had apparently gone to
the New York City Police Department School of Crowd Counting. But
there certainly were 30 cameras, and as a whole the turnout was
probably the largest press corps ever assembled for a political
event held in a pasture.
</P>
<P>
   What made the event most significant was not that Mrs. Clinton
was appearing for the first time as the proud possessor of a newly
formed campaign exploratory committee. Nor was it Moynihan's
endorsement, which he almost forgot to deliver. The big moment came
when she finally acknowledged that yes, it was probably a little
peculiar for a first lady to run for the Senate from a state where
she has never lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a very fair question,'' she said in answer to the
inevitable carpetbagging query. ``I fully understand people raising
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The reporters had no tricky questions on her position on the
milk compact or the problems of the Montgomery Otsego Schoharie
Solid Waste Management Authority. Like most of the universe, the
press corps was fixated on the circumstance behind her candidacy,
beginning with Monica Lewinsky (was Mrs. Clinton benefiting from
her status as victim?) and ending with the chutzpah required for a
person to have a Senate Exploratory Committee before she has a
mailing address.
</P>
<P>
   But except for questions relating to Ms. Lewinsky, whose name
causes her to flinch and change the subject, the first lady has a
handle on her problem. She has gone way beyond her earlier attempts
to establish New Yorker status by discussing local agricultural
produce and wearing a Yankees hat.
</P>
<P>
   Instead she is using that old trick _ perhaps better known to
women than men _ that assumes there is nothing more ingratiating
than acknowledging one's ignorance and begging to be educated. Her
plan is to spend the next several months traveling around the state
asking for information.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confident she will be able to meet with New Yorkers and
listen to their concerns,'' her press spokesman Howard Wolfson said
in response to many different questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will these be real New Yorkers?'' asked a TV reporter
suspiciously.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Mrs. Clinton said that having one meeting after
another with average New Yorkers about education and health and
agriculture and transportation was exactly her idea of a fun way to
spend the summer. Anticipating the press corps' collapse into
misery and boredom will no doubt make the prospect all the sweeter.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton ``listening tour'' is actually a clever campaign
device that offers the candidate a chance to do quite a bit of
talking within a noncontroversial first lady format. Her shakedown
session in Oneonta Wednesday featured five local residents talking
about schools while Mrs. Clinton nodded, took notes and delivered
supportive comments (``I'm a very strong proponent of early
pre-K.''). When an education professor talked about local rural
poverty, Mrs. Clinton said she had seen exactly the same problems
in Arkansas. But when a remedial-education teacher moved into more
controversial waters, decrying politicians who were trying to drive
her students out of college in the name of higher standards, Mrs.
Clinton just nodded cheerfully, and thanked her for her comments.
</P>
<P>
   While Mrs. Clinton was working her way around her residency
problem, her potential opponent Rudolph Giuliani, New York City's
mayor, was digging himself into a hole. The mayor is a native New
Yorker, but lately he seems compelled to gild the lily. To hear
Giuliani tell it this week, he is a cross between Johnny Appleseed
and an upstate Amway salesman. He has not only campaigned in
upstate New York, he used to work there! In a bunch of different
places! He is expert in state geography and an outdoorsman familiar
with the local flora and fauna.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a great deal of knowledge of the state of New York _
far more than you actually think I do,'' he told reporters shortly
before he confused a town in the Catskills with a county several
hundred miles farther north. He managed to make Hillary Clinton
look like the candidate who is best at handling the carpetbagging

<P>
   A Florida jury Wednesday found against the nation's biggest
tobacco companies in the first class-action case to reach a
verdict, holding that they conspired to hide the danger and
addictiveness of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   The six-member jury in a Miami state court also said that both
compensatory and punitive damages could be awarded, throwing open
the door to hundreds of thousands of potential claims by current
and former smokers in Florida that could cost the tobacco industry
billions to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's decision ended the first phase of a complex trial
that has already lasted a year. In the next phases, jurors will
review the cases of smokers and decide whether to award damages.
Claims can be filed on behalf of any Florida resident, living or
dead, who was addicted to cigarettes and suffered certain
smoking-related diseases as determined by jury decision.
</P>
<P>
   But the tobacco industry has a wide variety of appeals open to
it that could alter the outcome of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier settlements by tobacco producers totaling $246 billion
to resolve lawsuits brought by state attorneys general seeking to
recover health-care costs spent treating smoking-related illnesses
did not bar claims by individual smokers or classes of them.
</P>
<P>
   The industry had initially sought such protections as the price
of settling the state lawsuits but dropped the effort when
anti-smoking groups opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   Court decisions in cases brought by individual smokers have been
mixed recently. But Wednesday's decision follows two large jury
awards against producers in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   In March, an Oregon state jury ordered Philip Morris Cos. to pay
$81 million in compensatory and punitive damage to the family of a
man who smoked Marlboro cigarettes for four decades before he died.
And in February, a California jury ordered Philip Morris to pay
$51.5 million to a woman who said her inoperable lung cancer was
caused by smoking, though the punitive damage part of that award
has since been cut in half.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for both plaintiffs and the tobacco companies involved
in the Florida case were barred by Robert Kaye, the presiding
Circuit Court judge, from commenting on Wednesday's decision. But
producers are expected to challenge the class-action proceeding as
soon as the first award against them is made.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Aronson, the president of Aronson Washington Research,
which follows tobacco litigation for institutional investors, said
that it is highly unusual for any class-action case of the
magnitude of the Florida smoking lawsuit to go to verdict because
of the magnitude of the stakes involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``With several hundreds of thousands of people lining for
claims, this could mean a lot of money,'' said Ms. Aronson. ``It
also could also block the Florida court dockets for many years to
come with smoking claims.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with Philip Morris, the defendants in the Miami case
included R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., a subsidiary of RJR Nabisco
Holdings; Lorillard Tobacco, a subsidiary of Loews; Liggett Group,
a subsidiary of Brooke Group, and Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco, a
subsidiary of BAT Industries PLC. Two now-defunct trade groups, the
Council for Tobacco Research and the Tobacco Institute, were also
defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida class-action lawsuit was filed in 1994 by Stanley
Rosenblatt, a lawyer in Miami. In 1998, Rosenblatt and and his
wife, Susan, who is also a lawyer, scored a major victory when
tobacco producers agreed to pay $300 million to settle a lawsuit
brought by them on behalf of 60,000 flight attendants who had
claimed injury from secondhand smoke.
</P>
<P>
   The six-member Miami jury, which included one smoker, heard from
more than 80 witnesses. Rosenblatt also presented thousands on
internal industry documents, including many uncovered by lawyers
preparing for Minnesota's lawsuit last year against the industry.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last July, Rosenblatt said that one thrust of
his case would be to show that the tobacco industry had attempted
``through diversionary tactics to keep alive a nonexistent
scientific controversy about smoking and health.''
</P>
<P>
   Also at that time, Robert Heim, a lawyer for Philip Morris, said
the producers planned to stake their defense on evidence showing
that the public had long been aware of smoking risks.
</P>
<P>
   Though many tobacco industry analysts had expected that the
tobacco industry would lose the Miami trial's first phase,
Wednesday's decision, which came just after Wall Street trading
closed, sent tobacco stocks lower. Shares of Philip Morris fell
$2.625 a share to $37.875 and shares of Reynolds Tobacco closed
down $1.1875 a share at $30.875. Loews lost $0.8125 to close at
$79.167.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Feldman, a tobacco industry analyst with Salomon Smith
Barney, said he expected that cigarette producers would seek to
have a higher Florida court decertify the class-action as soon as
the first damages were awarded.
</P>
<P>
   Higher courts can decertify, or disband, class-action lawsuits
approved by trial judges if they find that there are not enough
common factors among class members or if they determine that the
resolution of a case would be legally cumbersome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe this case is likely to be decertified,'' Feldman
said. ``But if it is not, then it would be an important stepping
stone to significant monetary awards against the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Wednesday's decision, some analysts and lawyers suggested
that if the industry lost the first round of the case it would move
to settle the action if it failed to decertify the class.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami trial unfolded in a highly charged emotional
atmosphere. Many of the selected plaintiffs, crippled or disabled
by various diseases, did not testify, but took their place in the
courtroom daily. One man said he developed a circulatory condition
that led to operations resulting in the amputations of both legs.
Others, who had lost their vocal cords to throat cancer, spoke with
the aid of artificial voice boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was ever going to be any sympathy votes it is going
to be in this situation,'' said Ms. Aronson, the analyst in
Washington who attended the trial for a week.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason for its decision, the jury decided uniformly
against the tobacco industry on each of 10 questions it was asked
to resolve. They included whether producers concealed and
misrepresented the hazards and addictiveness of smoking and whether
they conspired with each other to misled the public.
</P>
<P>
   The jury also found that the companies lied and made misleading
statements and determined that 20 of 23 possible diseases were
potentially caused by smoking.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for damage awards, the nine people who serve as
representative class members and the others who will follow them
must now show that they suffer from diseases that qualify, that
their health problems were caused by smoking and that they were
deceived by the industry's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   If they succeed, the size of damage awards against producers
could easily mount into the billions. And some analysts believe
that they may lead plaintiffs' lawyers in other states to mount
similar class-actions against the industry
</P>
<P>
   ``This could embolden a lot of other lawyers,'' Ms. Aronson
said.

EDITORIAL: A SUMMONS TO PEACE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, July 8:
</P>
<P>
   Israel's new prime minister, Ehud Barak, is acting like a
statesman. With an eloquent inaugural speech Tuesday and plans for
a quick round of meetings with Arab leaders before meeting
President Clinton next week, he seems committed to reviving the
stalled quest for Mideast peace.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has wisely decided to complete the unfinished business of
making an accord with the Palestinians and to seek improved
relations with Syria and Lebanon. He also wants to deepen relations
with Egypt and Jordan, moving beyond mere diplomatic recognition
toward true partnership.
</P>
<P>
   In his inaugural message Barak was inclusive and conciliatory,
expressing empathy not only for the Palestinians and other Arabs
but for the defeated Likud Party of former Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and for Israel's disadvantaged minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast to Netanyahu was striking when Barak spoke of his
desire to work in ``partnership and respect'' with the Palestinian
leadership under Yasser Arafat. ``I call on all regional leaders to
take our outstretched hands and build a peace of the brave,'' Barak
declared, setting a tone different from his predecessor's.
</P>
<P>
   Barak begins his peacemaking this weekend, when he plans to meet
with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and Arafat. Next week he
expects to see King Abdullah of Jordan and then travel to
Washington for talks with Clinton. With the administration in
accord with Barak's agenda, his talks at the White House are likely
to be more amicable than Netanyahu's visits.
</P>
<P>
   With the Palestinians, Barak's first action will be carrying out
the Israeli withdrawals agreed to at Wye River last fall and then
suspended by Netanyahu. Some 10 percent of additional West Bank
land is to be handed over to Palestinian control and 500 additional
Palestinian prisoners released.
</P>
<P>
   Barak initially hoped to skip these steps and move straight to
negotiations on the difficult issues of Jerusalem, Jewish
settlements, Palestinian refugees, water and possible Palestinian
statehood. But at the insistence of Arafat and Washington, he has
accepted the timetable agreed to last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has made a point of reaching out to Syria, and on Tuesday
he advertised his willingness to reach agreement on the basis of
U.N. resolutions calling for the exchange of occupied land for
peace. That seems a signal that Israel is willing to negotiate the
return of all or most of the Golan Heights in return for firm
security guarantees. Barak has also said he is willing to resume
talks with Syria where they broke off three years ago,
incorporating the preliminary progress that had been made on the
issues of security arrangements and diplomatic normalization.
</P>
<P>
   Syria's president, Hafez al-Assad, has responded positively to
these overtures, and his trip to Moscow this week seems intended to
prepare for negotiations, though his bid for new Russian weapons is
troubling. Talks with Damascus must also involve Lebanon, which
Syria dominates, and from which Barak wants to withdraw Israeli
troops.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has set an ambitious though appropriate agenda.
Peacemaking is sure to be difficult. Israelis and Arabs alike will
have to make painful compromises on sensitive issues. But Barak is
right to embrace the challenge and deserves strong American
support.

EDITORIAL: THE BLACKOUT AND ITS CAUSES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, July 8:
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers and their political leaders responded admirably to
Tuesday night's power shortages, including a sudden blackout in the
Washington Heights and Inwood neighborhoods of Manhattan. Though
trapped in darkness and suffocating heat, thousands of residents
north of 155th Street displayed the kind of grit and grace that
made for a largely peaceful night. The Giuliani administration,
meanwhile, successfully scrambled to insure public safety and offer
aid and shelter for those who needed it, thereby discouraging the
violence that marked the 1977 citywide blackout. In fact, every
major player in this heat and power crisis performed creditably,
except for Consolidated Edison.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has properly raised questions that must
be on the mind of every resident and business. One is whether Con
Ed's distribution system is adequate to meet foreseeable peak
demands. The other is whether the utility is making the necessary
investments in backup systems so that when one element in its
network fails, another can take its place. This is not an academic
question for a company that is busily divesting itself of its
generating plants in order to focus on the distribution and
transmission of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Con Ed's response has been unenlightening. At a news conference
Wednesday J. Michael Evans, Con Ed's president, declined repeatedly
to address the mayor's questions. ``We appreciate all the patience
our customers have shown'' was about all Evans would say. This is
an age of advanced technology and sophisticated tools to predict
demand. New Yorkers are thus owed a credible, detailed account of
what caused the malfunction of feeder cables uptown, as well as a
fuller justification for the decision to shut off the power north
of 155th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, New York State's Public Service Commission should
speed its investigation of Con Ed's performance. This is all the
more important because the nation's utilities, including Con Ed,
are transforming themselves from highly regulated monopolies into
market-driven companies. During this transition to a world of
minimal regulation and maximum competition, state and federal
authorities need to exercise continued vigilance to protect the
basic functions of everyday life by insuring a reliable flow of
power. Over the long term, the state will need greater investment
in energy efficiency and on-site power generation from photovoltaic
cells and other sources. These demand-management tools can also
help avert crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In all other respects, the city has much to be proud of.
Ordinary New Yorkers acted with remarkable forbearance. There were
few lootings and only a handful of arrests, thanks partly to
Giuliani's decision to quickly deploy extra police officers over
250 blocks in northern Manhattan. Acting on contingency plans
devised after Chicago's brutal heat wave in 1995, officials ordered
extra ambulances into service and opened 15 schools across the city
where anyone could sleep in air-conditioned comfort. There were,
regrettably, at least eight deaths attributed to the heat. But
without a general display of good sense, the suffering could have
been much worse.

WASTE MANAGEMENT SHARES FALL 36 PERCENT ON PROFIT WARNING
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Texas)   (nk) 
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Skittish investors sent shares of Waste Management Inc., the
nation's largest trash hauler, into free fall Wednesday, a day
after the company warned analysts that revenue and earnings for the
second quarter were much lower than anyone had expected.
</P>
<P>
   The stock tumbled $19.625, or 36.6 percent, to $33.9375, its
lowest price since the company was formed last July when USA Waste
Services acquired Waste Management Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts, many of whom had had strong buy recommendations on the
stock, flooded First Call Corp., which tracks analysts' estimates,
with downgrades Wednesday. ``This wasn't a reaction to one
quarter's numbers,'' said Charles L. Hill, First Call's director of
research. ``This was a confidence issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Waste Management's second-quarter results are not
catastrophic. The company, which is based in Houston, said its
quarterly revenue would be off by $250 million _ not a death blow
for a company whose annual revenue approaches $13 billion. It said
earnings would come in between 67 and 70 cents a share, much lower
than the 78 cents analysts had expected but well above the 41 cents
a share it earned in the second quarter last year. For the year,
the company now expects earnings of $2.65 to $2.70 a share, up from
$1.82 last year but below analysts' prior expectations of $3.01.
</P>
<P>
   But the company, which had blessed the 78 cent estimate as
recently as May, has not explained why it did not meet its own
predictions. ``We had lower revenues and volume in June, and we're
working to understand exactly what created this shortfall,'' said
Cherie Rice, vice president for investor relations.
</P>
<P>
   That left analysts to come to their own, mostly unflattering,
conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The merger just isn't going very well,'' said Douglas R.
Augenthaler, an analyst with CIBC World Markets. ``They haven't
gotten the cost synergies they expected, and they haven't
integrated their information system.''
</P>
<P>
   Augenthaler suspects that faulty data may have wreaked havoc on
routing systems and billing procedures, alienating customers. And
he thinks it kept the company from realizing in time that its own
forecasts were off and that this late realization prompted it to
raise prices in large markets like New York in a futile attempt to
make up the slack. Instead, it alienated customers even further.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were like a basketball player taking the shot from
midcourt at the buzzer,'' Augenthaler said. ``The shot clanked off
the rim.''
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts say the rush to sell stemmed from a belief that
the history of mismanagement, accounting discrepancies and earnings
disappointments that plagued Waste Management before it was
acquired was going to be endlessly repeated. They worry that John
Drury, the merged company's chief executive, who is undergoing
treatment for brain cancer, is not well enough to ride herd on
field operations, and that Rodney R. Proto, its president, is being
stretched too thin as he tries to do two jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real feeling of, `Uh-oh, here we go again,' '' said
James N. Kelleher, an analyst with Argus Research. ``Any other
company, you'd say they just goofed, but this company acquired a
legacy of funny accounting and bad karma.''
</P>
<P>
   As an independent company, Waste Management spent the early
1990s buying up hundreds of waste haulers and chemical waste
treaters worldwide, only to shed many of them when they proved
unprofitable. It had three chief executives in two years; one of
them, Ronald T. LeMay, departed scarcely four months after joining
amid speculation that he was angry over accounting discrepancies.
Last year, the company acknowledged that it had overvalued its
landfills, trucks and other assets, and it revised earnings from
1992 through 1997 downward by $3.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the company's reputation among customers was intact when
USA Waste Services bought it last year, one reason the new parent
chose to retain the Waste Management name instead of its own. That
decision, analysts say, is coming back to haunt it now.

CLINTON SEES PLIGHT OF INDIANS, OFFERS INITIATIVES &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By NANCY MATHIS
 &HT;    c. 1999 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINE RIDGE, S.D. _ Tears came to Geraldine Blue Bird's eyes as
she described to President Clinton her hand-to-mouth existence, of
the 27 relatives who live with her in her ramshackle home and the
rundown trailer beside it, of the desperate need for jobs _ and
hope.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Bird, 44, may be a descendant of the first Americans, but
American Indians here on the 7 million-acre Pine Ridge Oglala Sioux
Reservation are last on every chart, and seemingly on everyone's
mind, the poorest of the poor in a thriving nation.
</P>
<P>
   After touring the Igloo neighborhood here, so named because many
homes are converted Army barracks from Igloo, S.D., the president
on Wednesday declared the conditions faced by American Indians to
be appalling and offered a series of initiatives to encourage home
ownership and business development.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you brought jobs here, that's the first step in helping us
out,'' a tearful Blue Bird told Clinton, who held her hand as they
sat on her front porch and sought to console her with a pledge for
help. She's one of 58 people living on the Igloo block, almost all
of them on public assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, only the second president to visit an Indian
reservation in 50 years, later told a gathering of national tribal
leaders, ``We cannot rest until we do better and trying is not
enough; we have to have results. We can do better.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's visit here came on the third day of his
six-state tour of the nation's poorest regions to promote his New
Markets Initiative to attract businesses to these areas and to
shine a national spotlight on those corners of America missing from
the bright economy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton later flew to Phoenix to tour a Mexican food
manufacturing plant and spoke to business executives about start-up
companies, especially in Hispanic neighborhoods. Gene Humphrey, an
Enron executive, told Clinton that the Houston corporation has
started an equity company that so far as invested in four
businesses, three of them Hispanic-owned.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we're going to do is encourage other
corporations to take the same step,'' Humphrey said. ``It's good
business for us, it's good for the community, and it's good for the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   In Pine Ridge, native dancers greeted Clinton as his helicopter
armada ferried Cabinet members, corporate leaders and members of
Congress to the reservation.
</P>
<P>
   The president toured an old neighborhood and a new one. He also
shared an outdoor stage with tribal leaders, some in traditional
feather headdresses. A teepee served as the backdrop, and buffalo
hides draped the platform rails.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Salway, president of the Oglala Sioux nation, praised
Clinton for ``opening the doors'' for American Indians. He called
Clinton's visit ``a great opportunity to remind Americans that
Indian people walk in both worlds'' of tradition and the
mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton noted that nearly 19 million jobs have been created
since 1993, but American Indians, especially those living on
reservations, remain mired in poverty and unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   In South Dakota, the administration promoted not only private
sector efforts but also action the government can take to provide
building blocks for economic development. In the isolated,
wind-swept plains, the needs start with the most basic necessities
such as housing and drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, an estimated 29 percent of the American Indians are
homeless and 59 percent live in substandard housing.
</P>
<P>
   Salway said 4,000 Sioux here are on a waiting list for homes and
20 percent of the homes lack plumbing.
</P>
<P>
   Alcoholism and other social ills also plague the reservation
here. An estimated 63 percent of the population of the Pine Ridge
reservation lives below the poverty line. Per capita income in 1990
was $3,417, making it the poorest region in the nation, according
to the last census.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have suffered from neglect, and you know that doesn't
work. You have also suffered from the tyranny of patronizing,
inadequately funded government programs and you know that doesn't
work,'' Clinton said. ``We're not coming from Washington to tell
you exactly what to do and how to do it, we're coming from
Washington to ask you what you want to do, and tell you we will
give you the tools and support to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration, placing an emphasis on housing on the
reservations nationwide, announced several initiatives by the
Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the
Department of Housing and Urban Development to make more
low-interest loans available. There are no banks on the
reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Fannie Mae will make $6 million in low-interest loans available
to Sioux tribal members, part of a $500 million package for South
Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   HUD, hosting a ``shared vision'' housing conference in nearby
Rapid City, announced a new partnership with private lenders to
help create 1,000 new homeowners on Indian reservations nationwide
in three years by doubling the number of government-guaranteed
loans.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department also will earmark grants for water
development. Many homes around Pine Ridge have no running water.
The Federal Communications Commission also will work on improving
telephone systems.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Salway also signed an agreement granting empowerment
zone status to the reservation, which makes businesses locating
here eligible for federal tax incentives.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are investigating
whether a New Jersey man was involved in the conspiracy to
assassinate Rabbi Meir Kahane nine years ago, according to an
indictment unsealed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Mustafa Elnore of Jersey City, N.J., was charged in the
indictment with lying to a grand jury about what prosecutors said
was his role in the murder and what they called his bomb-making
activities and firearms training with a circle of Brooklyn-based
Arab militants in the early 1990s. Some of those militants were
convicted in the bombing of the World Trade Center and a conspiracy
to blow up the United Nations and other landmarks in New York City
in 1993, and of Kahane's killing in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   During his grand jury appearance, Elnore was asked several
questions about his knowledge of the shooting of Kahane in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Elnore, 37, was not charged with any crimes other than perjury.
But at a bail hearing at federal court in Manhattan, a prosecutor
said that his asserted lies ``were involved with and clearly
related to terrorist activities.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor, Joshua G. Berman, asked that Elnore be jailed
without bond pending trial, contending that he was dangerous and
might flee the country if released,
</P>
<P>
   Over the objections of Elnore's lawyer, Chief Magistrate Judge
James C. Francis IV agreed to jail Elnore without bond, on the
ground that he might flee. The magistrate did not address the
question of whether Elnore posed a danger.
</P>
<P>
   Elnore's lawyer, Mahmoud Ramadan, said after court that his
client denied lying to the grand jury and also denied the
underlying allegations of wrongdoing. The charges, which the
indictment said stemmed from the original investigation into the
World Trade Center bombing and the plot to bomb the landmarks, do
not specifically cite the current government investigation into the
bombings of the U.S. Embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es
Salaam, Tanzania, last August, which killed more than 200 people
and injured thousands.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment also indicated that prosecutors were
investigating whether Elnore was involved in the 1990 murder of
Rashad Khalifa, a Muslim leader in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The government has said in earlier court hearings that el Hage
is being investigated in connection with that murder as well.
</P>
<P>
   During Wednesday's court proceedings, Elnore sat quietly as his
lawyer, Ramadan, disputed the government's assertions.
</P>
<P>
   Ramadan said that Elnore, a native of Egypt who has obtained his
U.S. citizenship, ran his own business and posed no threat to
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's charged with perjury,'' Ramadan said. ``He's not charged
with anything to do with bomb making or firearms.''
</P>
<P>
   But the prosecutor, Berman, said the government had evidence to
prove that Elnore had lied, including photographs and witnesses
that show he was involved in the firearms training and bomb-making.
</P>
<P>
   Berman offered no additional details about the Kahane killing,
but the fact that Elnore was asked about the case in his grand jury
appearance in early 1998 makes clear that the authorities have
never closed the book on the murder, which took place in a
Manhattan hotel ballroom on Nov. 5, 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Another man, El Sayyid A. Nosair, who was acquitted of the
murder in a state trial in 1991, was convicted in 1995 on a federal
charge of murder in aid of racketeering, and sentenced to life in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's indictment suggests prosecutors believe they can
prove that Elnore was involved in a conspiracy to murder Kahane,
who was the leader of the Jewish Defense League.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In his grand jury appearance, Elnore was asked whether he knew
that Nosair had planned to kill Kahane, the indictment shows.
</P>
<P>
   Elnore said no.
</P>
<P>
   He was asked whether he knew Nosair had tried to kill Kahane on
prior occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Elnore said no.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Elnore was asked: ``Did you ever have a conversation
with Nosair prior to the murder of Kahane where you discussed
whether or not he should use a silencer when he killed Rabbi
Kahane?''
</P>
<P>
   Elnore again said no, according to the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   The government said that all three responses were lies.

 &HT;    Listen up: Clinton goes 'exploring'
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVENPORT, N.Y. _ Wednesday was a cloudless blue day in central
New York, picture perfect for passing on a political torch and for
answering at least one of the questions swirling around Hillary
Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers may be baffled as to why the first lady would
consider representing them in the Senate, let alone where she'd
live in their great state.
</P>
<P>
   But why, they may wonder, is Clinton's New York trip, kicked off
with a heavily publicized visit to retiring Democratic Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan's farm, called a ``listening tour''? Well, the
reason for that suddenly seemed crystal clear.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody in New York has plenty to say about Clinton and the
2000 Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ``People call her a carpetbagger, but you know what, Pat
Moynihan was a carpetbagger, too,'' Donna Whitbeck, 44, said
defiantly Wednesday morning, referring to the former Massachusetts
resident who bought property here in the '60s and became her much
beloved neighbor. ``So that's what I think of that whole
carpetbagger charade!''
</P>
<P>
   It should be noted that Moynihan spent much of his boyhood in
New York City, but emotion rather than facts seemed to rule the
carpetbagger debate, at least among the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, when Clinton stopped for lunch with the mayor
of Oneonta at Brooks House of Bar-B-Q, a customer yelled out, ``Go
home!'' Another customer answered, ``You go home!'' The first
yelled back, ``I live here! And I'm not running for senator!'' The
shouting match eventually involved a dozen spectators.
</P>
<P>
   The carpetbagger issue was also the first question raised by the
press at Moynihan's farm.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton brushed aside the point: ``What I am for is maybe as
important, if not more important, than where I am from.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said New Yorkers had some ``very legitimate questions''
about what she believes in and the skills and interests she would
bring to the job. She said she would address them.
</P>
<P>
   She pledged she would be a ``strong and effective advocate on
behalf of the people of New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan essentially endorsed Clinton. ``I hope she'll go all
the way, and I mean to go all the way with her,'' the white-haired
senator told 200 members of the press pack, including 30-plus TV
news crews jammed onto a temporary scaffolding.
</P>
<P>
   They had been gathered for more than an hour in what was a
hayfield the day before, passing the time by jabbering into cell
phones, visiting a lemonade stand run by neighborhood kids, or
explaining why this was such a big story back home in Japan and
France.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she has star power in France,'' Sylvie Kaufmann of Le
Monde newspaper said of the first lady. ``Even before Monica
Lewinsky, people there were intrigued by her because she's a strong
woman, and outspoken and bright.
</P>
<P>
   ``And also,'' Kaufmann confided, ``the belief in France that
she'll run for president someday adds to the attraction of this
story.''
</P>
<P>
   President? Hillary Clinton hasn't even formally announced for
the Senate yet; indeed, it was only on Tuesday that she formed an
exploratory committee. Throughout Wednesday's visit, which also
included a stop at the State University of New York campus for a
discussion of educational issues, Clinton chose her words
carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I run and am honored to be elected ...'' she typically
began one response in a brief question-and-answer session at
Moynihan's farm.
</P>
<P>
   Even the kids running the lemonade stand out of Moynihan's barn
seemed a bit confused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary Clinton's coming up here today because she's running
for senator,'' said Rebecca Marcus, 9, collecting a quarter from
another thirsty customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't she just coming to announce that today?'' wondered Della
Hodne, 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, she's just coming here,'' Mark Mader, 8, contradicted them
both patiently.
</P>
<P>
   One thing the young lemonade entrepreneurs knew for sure:
Moynihan's wife, Elizabeth (whose idea they said it was they go
into business for a day), probably expected them to keep the money
for themselves, but they had other ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to give all the money to Mrs. Clinton for her
campaign,'' Rebecca announced, pointing proudly to a cigar box
containing about $10 in paper and coins.
</P>
<P>
   No telling what use New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani might
make of news of the campaign contribution. The all-but-announced
Republican contender for the Senate seat, Giuliani is so convinced
the first lady's running that when he's not planning his own
in-your-face fund-raising lunch for later this month in the
Clintons' hometown of Little Rock, he's taking pains to point out
that he's a native New Yorker whose ``very significant knowledge of
the whole state'' is vastly superior to hers.
</P>
<P>
   That may have influenced the Clinton exploratory committee's
decision to issue press passes that have as their background a map
of central New York _ not the New York City area, where Giuliani
lives and Clinton reportedly is house-hunting.
</P>
<P>
   In her informal discussion with school board members, students
and parents gathered Wednesday afternoon at the State University of
New York at Oneonta, she displayed a star pupil style familiarity
with test results, school district sizes and other issues of local
concern as she discussed the need for universal pre-kindergarten
programs.
</P>
<P>
   She also promised to help retain young teachers in classrooms,
bolster public education, and _ in a preview of the health-related
issues she will discuss today _ pledged to reduce the numbers of
Americans who do not have health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Giuliani's geographic gibes may have backfired on him
Wednesday, as the New York Post gleefully reported that the mayor
had mixed up his Monroes.
</P>
<P>
   After Giuliani told reporters he'd beaten the New York heat by
spending Monday way upstate with his son in bucolic Monroe County,
the Post checked out his claim. It seems the mayor actually went to
the town of Monroe, which is in an entirely different county only
40 miles north of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton people had no comment on the Giuliani gaffe. Not so
the press, which spent much of the nearly 90-minute bus ride from
Albany to Moynihan's farm pointing to random fields and shouting
out comments like, ``Look, Rudy once flew a kite there!''
</P>
<P>
   Yet going in and out of Davenport, the buses also passed by
small clusters of people holding anti-Hillary signs (''We need a
New Yorker, not a Clinton,'' said one) and one guy waving an
elephant-shaped placard that simply read, ``Rudy!''
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder folks around here wonder just what, exactly, is
going on in their state?
</P>
<P>
   It's not just the fact that so much mystery and mudslinging has
already built up around an election that is still 16 months away.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the matter of the likely candidates themselves.
</P>
<P>
   For every person here who claims not to like Clinton for
``carpetbagging'' reasons, there's another who doesn't like
Giuliani because he's from _ shudder! _ New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, we feel New York City turns a deaf ear to, well,
everywhere else,'' Janet Tenace, of nearby Colonie, said of the
common sentiment in this section of New York state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have one candidate from Arkansas and another from New
York City,'' lamented Dawn Purcell. ``You wonder, in a big state
like this, can't anyone find a third one?

<P>
   NEW YORK _ After a blackout that lasted nearly 19 hours, power
was restored to most of northern Manhattan Wednesday, but angry
city officials nonetheless threatened legal action against Con
Edison, saying the utility had failed to build a power system able
to withstand intense heat waves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the city of New York is entitled to a more secure flow
of electrical power than Con Edison is giving us,'' Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani said Wednesday, contending that poor planning by the
company had created a life-threatening crisis for the city. ``You
can't have too many nights like the night we had last night and not
expect that you are going to kill people.''
</P>
<P>
   The blackout in the Washington Heights and Inwood neighborhoods
was the most spectacular result of a three-day heat wave that
officials blamed for eight deaths in the city _ six in Manhattan
and two in Brooklyn. Most of the victims were elderly _ the
youngest was 53, the oldest 90 _ and all succumbed after their body
temperatures climbed to extremely dangerous levels. None of the
deaths were blamed directly on the Manhattan blackout.
</P>
<P>
   The blackout occurred when Consolidated Edison workers were
preparing to turn two power cables that had failed in upper
Manhattan on Tuesday night back on when one of the cables failed
again, sparking a fire. Con Ed said that it quickly shut down all
power to the entire area north of 155th Street to prevent further
damage.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond New York, officials said the heat caused seven deaths in
Pennsylvania, four in New Jersey, two in Massachusetts and two in
Washington. Scattered power failures continued to plague hundreds
of thousands of people across the Northeast and mid-Atlantic states
Wednesday, and hospitals continued to treat hundreds of people for
heat exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   New power failures flared in some parts of New York City,
including the Lower East Side, and also in downtown Newark, N.J.,
where blackouts knocked out power to the subway system,
Pennsylvania Station and thousands of homes and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   But temperatures across the region dropped significantly. In
Central Park, Wednesday's high reached a breezy 92 degrees, well
below the 101-degree temperatures recorded there on Monday and
Tuesday. In many New England cities, the highs barely nudged into
the low 80s, and the cooler weather is expected to last through the
week.
</P>
<P>
   Cheers and applause swept through the streets of northern
Manhattan when, at 5:05 p.m. ET, power was restored to 93 percent
of the affected customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lights went on, and the air-conditioner went on, and
everyone started screaming,'' Kelvin Nunez, 24, said outside his
apartment building on 159th Street. ``Then we relaxed in front of
the air-conditioner. It felt great. Cold. Nice. I knew I was going
to sleep well.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the length of the blackout, police reported only a
handful of looting arrests. But shopkeepers in the area, which is
home to many Dominican immigrants and includes some of the city's
poorest and most crowded neighborhoods, were left to contend with
another problem _ substantial stocks of spoiled food. Demetrio
Tavariz, who owns a bodega on 187th Street, was typical. He said he
had lost $1,000 worth of meat and dairy products. ``I don't know if
my insurance will cover it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   City officials also worried about expenses associated with the
blackout. Though no final cost estimate was available, hundreds of
additional police officers were deployed throughout the blackout
area, which encompassed all of Manhattan north of 155th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he had directed city attorneys to research a
lawsuit against Con Ed. The suit would likely have three
objectives: to seek money damages for public costs, to force Con
Edison to come up with a plan to prevent more blackouts, and to
establish an independent monitor to assess the quality of the
company's power system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night was not a natural disaster,'' the mayor said.
``Last night was a man-made disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   For guidance, the city's lawyers Wednesday were studying a
lawsuit the city filed against Con Edison after the 1977 blackout,
which left millions of residents without power for 25 hours.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, the Court of Appeals, New York state's highest
court, ruled that Con Edison's gross negligence led to the power
failure, but the court also held that the utility did not have to
pay New York City for additional police and fire protection caused
by the blackout. The city could, however, recover money for
property damage from the blackout or any resulting looting, the
ruling said.
</P>
<P>
   But officials at the state Public Service Commission, which
regulates utility companies, said that in studies of power failure
rates, Con Edison had the best performance of the state's utility
companies. As is routine for power failures, the commission said it
will examine Con Edison's efforts this week in New York City and
Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will review the utility's actions to ensure that they were
reasonable and that they complied with their operating
procedures,'' said Dave Flanagan, a spokesman for the commission.
</P>
<P>
   And as Giuliani spoke of lawsuits, his aides were acknowledging
that, despite years of complaining about blackouts, they remained
largely uninformed about the quality, design and load capacities of
the city's power grid.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Hauer, director of the Mayor's Office of Emergency
Management, said the city has enlisted consultants to study the
power system. ``The city will now get more involved in
understanding that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Con Edison officials declined to comment on the mayor's threat
of legal action, saying they were focusing instead on restoring
power to customers. But the mayor was not the only public official
consulting lawyers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   David Paterson, an influential Democratic state senator who
represents a portion of Washington Heights, said Wednesday that he
was considering organizing a class-action lawsuit against Con
Edison. He said many residents firmly believed that Con Edison cut
power to Washington Heights to spare the city's wealthier
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll never be able to convince anybody that it was a random
event,'' Paterson said, a remark echoed by other local officials.
``They think it was very deliberate and they think it was a chosen
way to handle the problem at our expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception in that area,'' he added, ``is that the area
has regularly been denied service and opportunity, and this is just
in furtherance of that same concept.''
</P>
<P>
   A Con Edison spokesman, Joseph Petta, responded: ``If that is
the perception, it is a false perception. There is no reason why
one network would not be maintained as diligently as another area,
regardless of its location.''
</P>
<P>
   J. Michael Evans, president of Con Edison, insisted that the
power network serving Washington Heights and Inwood was designed to
the same engineering specifications and received the same level of
maintenance and equipment upgrades as the company's other networks.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Company officials continued to give sometimes conflicting
accounts of the events that led up to the power failure. On Tuesday
night, Petta said the network crashed on its own because it was
overloaded by demand. Early Wednesday, Petta said the company
itself cut the power to prevent the blackout from spreading across
Manhattan. Later Wednesday, Con Edison denied that concerns over a
broader blackout figured into their decision.
</P>
<P>
   As Evans toured Washington Heights Wednesday afternoon with City
Council Speaker Peter Vallone, the utility executive told reporters
that the company had no choice but to cut power when a small fire
started in a substation that supplied electricity to northern
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very concerned that by continuing to operate the
network, it would overload and damage the facility, and ultimately
make it more difficult to restore service to the citizens of this
area,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But what remained undetermined Wednesday was why Washington
Heights' network began to fail in the first place, and why several
other networks across the city also came perilously close to
failing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't really tell you why,'' Evans said, adding that company
experts would conduct a complete analysis of their equipment and
systems.
</P>
<P>
   City officials, however, were focused on Con Edison's web of
feeder lines, insulated high-power lines that run underneath the
city's major avenues. By Con Edison's count, 50 of the system's
1,175 feeder lines failed during the heat wave.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day Wednesday, Con Ed scrambled to cope with an
unfolding public relations disaster. They issued apologies for the
power failure. They praised the residents of northern Manhattan.
They promised they were doing everything possible to restore power.
Evans, who earned $616,333 last year in salary and bonuses, even
sought to identify with those who suffered through a long, hot
night. He said his own house had been without power on Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife tells me it was very uncomfortable,'' he said, noting
that he never made it home to see for himself because he was
managing the company's response.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By ERIC BERGER
 &HT;    c. 1999 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Apparently lacking any substantive progress in finding
Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, federal authorities, along with his
common-law wife, asked the suspected serial killer Wednesday to
turn himself in.
</P>
<P>
   Julieta Dominguez Reyes was expected to make her appeal in
person at the FBI office here, where dozens of news cameras
awaited. But instead she made it through the FBI official leading
the Resendez-Ramirez task force.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has expressed to us her sincere wishes that he would turn
himself in to authorities,'' said Don K. Clark, FBI special agent
in charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has also expressed the fact that this activity has caused
her and her baby a great deal of pain and difficulty in living in
their community now.''
</P>
<P>
   Reyes says her 3-month-old daughter, Lirio Judith, was fathered
by Resendez-Ramirez, whom she said she last saw June 10 at their
home in Rodeo, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Clark would not say whether Reyes was in Houston, but a source
familiar with the investigation confirmed later that she was in
town cooperating with investigators. The source was unsure why
Reyes did not make her plea in person.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities also urged people to continue phoning in tips on the
man believed responsible for five murders in Texas, two in Illinois
and one in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our purpose here this afternoon is to continue to encourage a
higher level of public interest and participation,'' said Richard
Cravener, district director of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service's Houston office.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has received more than 3,000 tips since June 21, when
Resendez-Ramirez was named to the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives
list. Its last confirmed sighting of the suspect was June 18 in a
Louisville, Ky., homeless shelter.
</P>
<P>
   People with information are urged to contact local police or
call the FBI at 1-800-889-8161.
</P>
<P>
   Cravener, who also spoke Spanish in urging anyone with
information on Resendez-Ramirez to come forward, was apparently
appealing to immigrants _ legal and illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Illegal immigrants, he said, would still get reward money, now
$125,000, for the suspect's arrest, as well as possibly escape
deportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The INS is not in the position of offering amnesty,'' Cravener
said, but added that the government has means to provide temporary
visas to those who cooperate with federal investigations.

   PINDARS CORNERS, N.Y. _ The first lady of the United States flew
into New York on an Air Force jet Wednesday and presented herself
as a potential candidate to replace Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan
upon his retirement next year. Standing at Moynihan's side at his
farm here in upstate New York, Hillary Rodham Clinton described
questions about her residency as legitimate and said she would
attempt to address them in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very fair question and I fully understand people
raising it,'' Mrs. Clinton said, offering a response to the very
first issue raised at an appearance here that was part news
conference and part political spectacle. ``I think I have some real
work to do to get out and listen and learn from the people of New
York and demonstrate that what I'm for is maybe as important _ if
not more important _ than where I'm from.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton than plunged into her first day on the campaign
trail as a candidate, as opposed to the candidate's spouse. She
visited the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, ate lunch at a
barbeque restaurant in Oneonta, and savored the generally large and
enthusiastic crowds that turned out to catch sight of the first
lady and her entourage at every stop. She also held the first of
the orchestrated Listening to New Yorkers forums that are to anchor
her schedule this summer, listening intently and taking notes
during a discussion about education.
</P>
<P>
   It was, by any measure, a remarkable day in the politics of both
New York and the nation. It began at 11 a.m., when Moynihan slowly
escorted Mrs. Clinton up the road from the old school house on his
property that serves as his office to a huge assemblage of
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   As the center of the kind of attention that is unheard of in a
race for the U.S. Senate _ or even in the early days of a race for
president _ Mrs. Clinton began molding a new public image for
herself. With each of her eight answers at the 10-minute press
conference, and then in stops throughout the day, she stepped away
from the role of political wife that she has filled since Bill
Clinton was elected attorney general of Arkansas in 1976 and began
filling in the contours of her own potential candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton rarely mentioned her husband, whose term concludes
in January 2001, and the president was not at her side on
Wednesday, choosing instead to visit Indian reservations in South
Dakota. The first lady presented herself as someone who was ready
to learn about a state she has never lived in. She also, for the
first time, offered some hint of dealing with the more difficult
questions her aides said they expect, from unresolved questions
about Whitewater to why she may, after seven tumultuous years in
the White House, seek to become the first first lady in the
nation's history to run for public office. The leading Republican
candidate to run against her is Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I intend to be spending my time in the next days and weeks and
months listening to New Yorkers,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``Now I
suppose the questions on everybody's mind is, `Why the Senate and
why New York and why me?' All I can say is I care deeply about the
issues that are important in this state, that I've already been
learning about and hearing about.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``I would be, if I run and am honored to be elected,
a strong and effective advocate on the part of the people of New
York.''
</P>

<P>
   The place where Mrs. Clinton headed first _ Moynihan's 900-acre
farm in this one-traffic-light hamlet 70 miles west of Albany _ was
a curious choice. Of all the Democratic senators in Washington,
Moynihan often had the most unsettled relations with the Clintons.
He was particularly critical of Mrs. Clinton's failed effort to
advance a national health care plan at the start of her husband's
administration, and the president's aides frequently complained at
the start that Moynihan was not helping Clinton accomplish his
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   But Moynihan and Mrs. Clinton share a senior political adviser,
Mandy Grunwald, and Ms. Grunwald joined the two of them in their
private 25-meeting before their news conference. Mrs. Clinton has,
over the course of these past few months, repeatedly visited
Moynihan's home in Washington to discuss the potential race,
effectively recruiting him as her most prominent supporter.
</P>
<P>
   As a jaunty Moynihan walked her to the microphone _ a moment
suffused with generational symbolism _ he left no doubt about who
he wanted to succeed him. That said, he almost neglected to say
that as he turned over the platform to his guest.
</P>
<P>
   ``My God, I almost forgot,'' Moynihan exclaimed, then added:
``Yesterday, Hillary Clinton established an exploratory committee
with regards to a candidacy for the Senate, the United States
Senate from New York, a seat which I will vacate in a year and a
half. I'm here to say that I hope she will go all the way. I mean
to go all the way with her. I think she's going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton was assured if self-effacing throughout the day,
taking the guidance of her advisers, who have been concerned that
she may have projected something of an air of entitlement in past
discussions about the seat. She seemed undisturbed as she
encountered a steady if small stream of protesters who challenged
the credentials of this Chicago native to seek office in New York
state.
</P>
<P>
   When Mrs. Clinton arrived for lunch, she was greeted by a small
group of people shouting, ``Go Home Hillary.'' That chant was
drowned out by a rival chant of the first lady's supporters, ``We
want Hillary.''

   PHOENIX _ When Josie Ippolito was 7 years old, she loved to get
up at 3 a.m. to help her father make tortillas in their small
family shop in this struggling section of south-central Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was just something about it that was very exciting,''
Mrs. Ippolito recalled. ``And then at 7 o'clock, I'd come home and
be dead-beat tired and have to go to school.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 years later, Mrs. Ippolito is still getting up
early to help make tortillas, but now she is co-owner of the family
business, La Canasta Mexican Food Products, whose factory produces
about 840,000 corn and flour tortillas and tortilla chips in each
18-hour day for sale to the restaurant business nationwide. And as
she rushed around Wednesday morning preparing for a visit by
President Clinton, then ducked out to have her hair done, Mrs.
Ippolito could scarcely contain her excitement _ or her pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here,'' she said, gesturing at the 25,000-square-foot
factory around her, which the company built in 1994 with a $1.2
million loan from the Small Business Administration, a federal
agency, nearly doubling its previous space. ``We're making it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Mrs. Ippolito's business is a classic success story,
chosen by the White House to hammer home the president's message
about the benefits of government and private sector investment in
the pockets of urban and rural poverty that the booming national
economy has passed by. Mrs. Ippolito, who owns the business with
her mother and two of her sisters, is also part of a potent
emerging demographic group here: businesses owned by minorities and
women.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, the Phoenix metropolitan area has ranked third among
the top 50 cities in the nation in the growth of businesses owned
by women, rising to 94,500 this year from 42,000, according to the
National Foundation for Women Business Owners, and it ranked 15th
in the nation in the overall number of businesses owned by women.
In 1996, the last year for which figures are available, there were
9,000 businesses in Phoenix owned by Hispanic women alone,
employing 18,400 people and generating $1.6 billion in sales,
according to the foundation, a nonprofit research group based in
Silver Spring, Md.
</P>
<P>
   When La Canasta emerged as the White House's choice for
Clinton's main stop Wednesday in this fast-growing city, some local
Hispanic business leaders complained, according to a former
high-ranking local official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
They thought a tortilla factory was a cliche, the official said,
and wondered why the president did not visit one of the region's
several Hispanic-owned, high-technology start-up companies like
QuePasa.com, a booming Internet portal intended for Hispanic users.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some objection,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Ippolito made no apologies for La Canasta's low-tech
industrial processes, in which women still stretch flour tortillas
by hand before tossing them onto oven conveyers that bake them in
flavors from the classic lard-based standard to boutique versions
like spinach, tomato-basil and cilantro-jalapeno.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning the first offerings of a groaning buffet were
already spread out for Clinton, who has long had a hard time
resisting second helpings when it is Mexican day at the White House
mess, and Wednesday night he took note of how many customers La
Canasta's daily output serves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight-hundred forty-thousand a day!'' the president said.
``That's a lot of people, you know. Of course, not everybody eats
as many at one sitting as I do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud of the accomplishments we've made,'' Mrs.
Ippolito said, noting that 60 percent of the company's 140 workers
come from within a three-mile radius of the plant, many of them by
foot or bicycle, in a neighborhood that is part of a designated
19-square-mile ``enterprise community'' eligible for special
federal tax breaks. The workforce is about equally divided between
men and women. While the company does not disclose its annual
sales, it is clearly thriving, preparing to expand into a line of
retail tortilla products to be sold in supermarkets.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mrs. Ippolito may have begun her tortilla-making career as a
childhood lark, but she joined the business full time as a result
of a family tragedy: the death of her father, Richard (Wero) Abril,
in 1974. Her mother, Carmen Abril Lopez, was left with seven
children under the age of 24, and Mrs. Ippolito went to work in the
business, which had started as a neighborhood tamale stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a matter of survival at that point,'' Mrs.
Ippolito said. ``We all had to lock arms and go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the White House talks up its proposals of tax incentives
for new businesses in depressed areas, Mrs. Ippolito wants Clinton
to know that even existing small businesses need special help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been here 39 years,'' she said. ``It's nice to bring in
new businesses. However, you don't forget those businesses that
have a proven track record.''
